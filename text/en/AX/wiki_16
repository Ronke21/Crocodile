<text>Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is a professional association football club based in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. They compete in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system. 

Formed in 1867 as an offshoot of The Wednesday Cricket Club (itself formed in 1820), they were known as The Wednesday Football Club until 1929. Wednesday is one of the oldest surviving football clubs in the world of any code, and the second-oldest professional association football club in England. In 1868 its team won the Cromwell Cup, only the second tournament of its kind. They were founding members and inaugural champions of the Football Alliance in 1889, before joining The Football League three years later. In 1992, they became founder members of the Premier League. The team has spent most of its league history in English football&#x27;s top two flights, though they have not played in the top tier since being relegated in 2000.

The Owls, as they are nicknamed, are one of the most successful teams in English football by major honours, having won four league titles, three FA Cups, one League Cup and one FA Community Shield. Wednesday have also competed in UEFA cup competitions on four occasions, reaching the quarter-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1963. In 1991, they defeated Manchester United 1–0 in the Football League Cup final as a second-tier team. they remain the last team to win one of English football&#x27;s major trophies while outside the top flight.

In the 19th century, they played their matches at several stadiums around central Sheffield, including Olive Grove and Bramall Lane. Since 1899, the club has played all its home matches at Hillsborough stadium, a near-40,000 capacity stadium in the north-west Sheffield suburb of Owlerton. Wednesday&#x27;s biggest rivals are Sheffield United, with whom they contest the Steel City derby.

==History==

===Early years (1867–1889)===
Although no contemporary evidence has been found to support the claim, it is commonly believed that &quot;The Wednesday Cricket Club&quot; was formed in 1820. Nevertheless, an 1842 article in &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life&quot; magazine states the club was founded as far back as 1816.

The club was so named because it was on Wednesdays that the founding members had a half-day off work. They were initially based at the New Ground in Darnall, and often went by the name of &quot;Darnall Wednesday&quot;, but also played at Hyde Park. In 1855 they were one of six clubs that helped build Bramall Lane, and held a wicket there for many years.

Famous players to have represented the cricket club include Harry Sampson, who scored 162 on ice in 1841, Tom Marsden, who scored 227 for Sheffield &amp; Leicester vs Nottingham in 1826, and George Ulyett, who represented the club in the first ever international test match before becoming one of only a select band of players who played for both sections of The Wednesday Club.

On the evening of Wednesday 4 September 1867, a meeting was held at the Adelphi Hotel to establish whether there was interest among the club&#x27;s members to form a football club to keep the team together and fit during the winter months. The proposal proved very popular, with over 60 members signing up for the new team on the first night. They played their first match against The Mechanics on 19 October the same year, winning by three goals and four &#x27;rouges&#x27; to nil.

It soon became apparent that football would come to eclipse the cricketing side of the club in terms of popularity—the two sections went their separate ways in 1882 after a dispute over finances and the cricket club ceased to exist in 1925. On 1 February 1868, Wednesday played their first competitive football match as they entered the Cromwell Cup, a one-off four-team competition for newly formed clubs. A week after their semi-final, they went on to win the cup, beating the Garrick club in the final after extra time, the only goal being scored in diminishing light at Bramall Lane. This was one of the first recorded instances of a match being settled by a &quot;golden goal&quot; although the term was not in use at the time.

A key figure during the formative years of the football club was Charles Clegg, who joined the Wednesday in 1867. His relationship with the club lasted for the rest of his life and eventually led to his becoming the club&#x27;s chairman. He also became president and chairman of the Football Association, and was known as the &quot;Napoleon of Football&quot;. Clegg played for England in the first-ever international match, against Scotland in November 1872. This completed a unique double for the club, who could lay claim to having a player in the first international games of both cricket and football.

 In 1876 Wednesday acquired Scot James Lang. Although he was not employed by the club, he was given a job by a member of the Sheffield Wednesday board that had no formal duties. He is now acknowledged as the first professional football player in England. With Lang in their team the football club became one of the strongest in the region, a reputation that was cemented when they won the inaugural Sheffield FA Challenge Cup in 1877.

In 1880 the club entered the FA Cup for the first time, and they soon became one of the most respected sides in the country. But although they had had Lang on their books a decade earlier, the club officially remained staunchly amateur, and this stance almost cost the club its very existence. By the middle of the decade, Wednesday&#x27;s best players were leaving in their droves to join clubs who would pay them, and in January 1887 they lost 0–16 against Halliwell with just 10 players in their team. An emergency meeting was held, and the board members finally agreed to pay its players.

=== Professional football, English Champions and FA Cup winners (1889–1939) ===

The move to professionalism took the club from Bramall Lane, which had taken a share of the ticket revenue, to the new Olive Grove. In 1889 the club became founder members of the Football Alliance, of which they were the first champions in a season where they also reached the 1890 FA Cup final, losing 6–1 to Blackburn Rovers at Kennington Oval, London. Despite finishing the following season bottom of the Alliance, they were eventually elected to the expanded Football League in 1892. They won the FA Cup for the first time in 1896, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2–1 at Crystal Palace.

Owing to an expansion of the local railway lines, the club was told that they would have to find a new ground for the 1899–1900 season. After a difficult search the club finally bought some land in the village of Owlerton, which at the time was several miles outside the Sheffield city boundaries. Construction of a new stadium (now known as Hillsborough Stadium) was completed within months and the club was secured for the next century. In a strong decade, Wednesday won the League in the 1902–03 and 1903–04 seasons and the FA Cup again in 1907, beating Everton 2–1, again at Crystal Palace. When competitive football was suspended in 1915 because of the outbreak of World War I, the club participated in several regionalised war leagues, until 1919, when competitive football resumed.

They were relegated from the top flight for the first time in 1920, and did not return until 1926, and in the 1927–28 season they looked like going down again before securing a haul of 17 points from their last 10 matches to secure safety. Wednesday went on to win the League title the following season (1928–29), which started a run that saw the team finishing lower than third only once until 1936. The period was topped off with the team winning the FA Cup for the third time in the club&#x27;s history in 1935. When World War II began, the club entered non-competitive war leagues, returning to competitive football in 1946.

===The yo-yo years (1945–1959)===

The 1950s saw Wednesday unable to consistently hold on to a position in the top flight and this period became known as the yo-yo years. After being promoted in 1950 they were relegated three times, although each time they returned to the top flight by winning the Second Division the following season. The decade ended on a high note with the team finishing in the top half of the First Division for the first time since World War II.

===Back in the top flight and title contenders (1959–1970)===
In 1961, the club ran toe-to-toe with Tottenham Hotspur at the top of the table for the majority of the season – Wednesday became the first team to beat Spurs all season – before finally finishing in second place, which still (as of 2023) remains the club&#x27;s highest post-war league finish. In 1966 the club reached its fifth FA Cup final, but they were beaten 3–2 by Everton, having led 2–0.

Off the field the club was embroiled in the British betting scandal of 1964 in which three of its players, Peter Swan, David Layne and Tony Kay, were accused of match fixing and betting against their own team in an away game at Ipswich Town. The three were subsequently convicted and, on release from prison, banned from football for life. The three were reprieved in the early 1970s, with Swan and Layne returning to Hillsborough, and, though their careers were virtually over, Swan at least played some league games for The Owls.
===Darkest days and the fight back to the top (1970–1984)===
Wednesday were relegated at the end of the 1969–70 season; this began the darkest period in the club&#x27;s history, eventually culminating in the club dropping to the Third Division for the first time in its history, and in 1976 it almost fell into the Fourth Division. It was not until the appointment of Jack Charlton as manager in 1977 that the club started to climb back up the league pyramid. Charlton led the Owls back to the Second Division in 1980 before handing the reins to Howard Wilkinson, who took the club back into the top flight in 1984, after an absence of 14 years.

===Life at the top of the Premier League and European Football (1984–2000)===
Wednesday enjoyed success in its return to the top flight, finishing 8th in their first season back and then 5th the season later, qualifying for European football only to be disqualified due to England&#x27;s ban in Europe due to the Heysel Stadium disaster.

On 15 April 1989 the club&#x27;s stadium was the scene of one of the worst sporting tragedies ever, at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, at which 97 Liverpool fans were fatally crushed in the Leppings Lane end of the stadium. The tragedy resulted in many changes at Hillsborough and all other leading stadiums in England; it was required that terracing would be replaced with seats in stands, and that perimeter fencing should be removed.

In Ron Atkinson&#x27;s first full season as manager, 1989–90, Sheffield Wednesday finished 18th in the First Division and were relegated on goal difference, despite the acquisition of the talented John Sheridan and the fact they had pulled towards mid-table at one stage of the season. They regained promotion at the first attempt but the real highlight of the season was a League Cup final victory over Atkinson&#x27;s old club Manchester United. Midfielder Sheridan scored the only goal of the game, which delivered the club&#x27;s first major trophy since their FA Cup success in 1935. As of 2022 they remain the last team to win one of English football&#x27;s major trophies while outside the top flight. Atkinson moved to Aston Villa shortly after promotion was achieved, and handed over the reins to 37-year-old striker Trevor Francis.

Wednesday finished third in the First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, booking their place in the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup and becoming a founding member of the new FA Premier League.

1992–93 was one of the most eventful seasons in the history of Sheffield Wednesday football club. They finished seventh in the Premier League and reached the finals of both the FA Cup and the League Cup, but were on the losing side to Arsenal in both games, the FA Cup final going to a replay and only settled in the last minute of extra time. This prevented the Owls from making another appearance in European competition. Still, the 1992–93 season established Sheffield Wednesday as a top club. Midfielder Chris Waddle was voted Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year, and the strike partnership of David Hirst and Mark Bright was one of the most feared in the country. Francis was unable to achieve any more success at the club, and two seasons later he was sacked. His successor was former Luton, Leicester and Tottenham manager David Pleat.

David Pleat&#x27;s first season as Sheffield Wednesday manager was frustrating, as they finished 15th in the Premiership despite an expensively-assembled line-up which included the likes of Marc Degryse, Dejan Stefanovic and Darko Kovacevic – who all had disappointing and short-lived tenures at the club. An excellent start to the 1996–97 season saw the Owls top the Premiership after winning their first four games, and David Pleat was credited Manager of the Month for August 1996. But the club failed to mount a serious title challenge and they faded away to finish seventh in the final table. Pleat was sacked the following November with the club struggling at the wrong end of the Premiership, and Ron Atkinson briefly returned to steer the Owls clear of relegation.

At the end of the 1997–98 season, Ron Atkinson&#x27;s short-term contract was not renewed and Sheffield Wednesday turned to the Barnsley boss Danny Wilson as their new manager, after being rejected by both Gerard Houllier and Walter Smith who joined Liverpool and Everton respectively. Wilson&#x27;s first season at the helm brought a slight improvement as they finished 12th in the Premiership.

===Modern highs and lows (2000–2014)===
An expensively assembled squad including Paolo Di Canio, Benito Carbone and Wim Jonk failed to live up to the massive wage bill the club was paying and things eventually came to a head when Italian firebrand Di Canio was sent off in a match against Arsenal and proceeded to push the referee on his way off. Danny Wilson was sacked the following March with relegation looking a certainty for the Hillsborough club, following a disastrous 1999–2000 season where they had been hammered 8–0 by Newcastle United as early as September. His assistant Peter Shreeves took temporary charge but was unable to stave off relegation, with a 3–3 draw at Arsenal in May 2000 being enough to see the Owls tumble into the First Division.

Having spent large sums building squads that were ultimately ineffective, the club&#x27;s finances took a turn for the worse, and in 2003 they were relegated for a second time in four years, to the Second Division.

The club spent two years in the third tier before returning the Championship, Paul Sturrock&#x27;s side won the 2005 play-off final by defeating Hartlepool United 4–2 after extra time at the Millennium Stadium. Ultimately however, the club&#x27;s perilous financial position ensured another drop to League One was not too far away – five years after the play-off win of 2005, the Owls were again relegated to League One.

Between July and November 2010, Sheffield Wednesday faced a series of winding up orders for unpaid tax and VAT bills, with the club&#x27;s existence under severe threat. It was not until 29 November 2010, when businessman Milan Mandarić agreed to buy out the old owners, that the club could move forward.

Mandarić appointed former Wednesday player Gary Megson as manager partway through the 2010–11 season, and while Megson only stayed in the job for a year, what was mostly his side won promotion back to the Championship in May 2012, under the stewardship of new manager Dave Jones.

===The Chansiri era (2014–present)===
In 2014 the club was again taken over by a new owner, Thai businessman Dejphon Chansiri, purchasing the club from Milan Mandarić for £37.5m. Chansiri stated his intention to win Premier League promotion for the 2017–18 season – the football club&#x27;s 150th anniversary – and came close to achieving that goal a year head of schedule, with new coach Carlos Carvalhal leading the club into the end of season play-offs at the end of the 2015–16 season. Wednesday were beaten in the final by Hull City at Wembley. They made the play-offs again the following season, but lost on penalties to the eventually promoted Huddersfield Town in the semi-final.

The club were favourites to be promoted in the 2017–18 season, but injuries and poor results saw them drop to the lower half of the table. Carvalhal left by mutual consent in December 2017, and was replaced by Dutch manager Jos Luhukay a month later. The team finished in an uneventful 15th place at the end of the season. Luhukay was sacked in December 2018 after a run of only one win in 10, which left the team 18th in the table. He was replaced by former Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce who saw an upturn in form to finish 12th. However, Bruce controversially resigned in July 2019 to manage Newcastle United.

On 6 September 2019, the club appointed former Birmingham City manager Garry Monk as the new manager, who achieved a 16th-place finish in a season that was interrupted from March to June by the COVID-19 pandemic. On 31 July 2020, Sheffield Wednesday were found guilty of breaking EFL spending rules and began the 2020–21 season on -12 points, though the deficit was later reduced to -6 upon appeal. On 9 November 2020, Monk was sacked after a poor start to the season and was replaced by Tony Pulis. However, Pulis was also dismissed after only 45 days in charge on 28 December 2020. After a few months with Neil Thompson as caretaker manager, Darren Moore was appointed as the club&#x27;s third permanent manager of the season in March 2021. Despite taking the fight to the final day, Moore could not prevent relegation to League One come the end of the season, bringing Wednesday&#x27;s nine-year spell in the Championship to an end.

After failing to win promotion in their first season back in League One, Wednesday finished third in the 2022–23 season. In the play-off semi-finals, Wednesday lost 4–0 in the first leg against Peterborough United but won the second leg 5–1 before prevailing on penalties. Wednesday then won promotion back to the Championship by defeating Barnsley in the 2023 play-off final. Moore departed from the club on 19 June by mutual consent. 

Moore was replaced by Xisco Muñoz, however, he was sacked after 12 games with the club winless during his tenure. Early in the season, following fan protests, owner Chansiri said he would put no more money into the club, unhappy with fans&#x27; treatment towards him and his family. On 31 October 2023, Chansiri, citing cashflow problems, asked Wednesday fans to raise £2m by 10 November 2023 to help the club pay an outstanding HMRC debt and cover wages. Danny Röhl was announced as Munoz&#x27;s successor and oversaw a revival on form, eventually confirming safety from relegation on the final day of the season.

==Nickname, kits, crest and traditions==

===Nickname===
In their early years, the club was nicknamed The Blades, a term used for any sporting team from the city of Sheffield, famous the world over for its cutlery and knives. That nickname has been retained by Wednesday&#x27;s crosstown rivals, Sheffield United.

Although it is widely assumed that the club&#x27;s nickname changed to The Owls in 1899 after the club&#x27;s move to Owlerton, it was not until 1912, when Wednesday player George Robertson presented the club with an owl mascot, that the name took hold. A monkey mascot introduced some years earlier had not brought much luck.

===Kits===
Since its founding the club has played their home games in blue and white shirts, traditionally in vertical stripes. However, this has not always been the case and there have been variations upon the theme. A monochrome photograph from 1874 to 1875 shows the Wednesday team in plain dark shirts, while the 1871 &quot;Rules of the Sheffield Football Association&quot; listed the Wednesday club colours as blue and white hoops. A quartered blue and white design was used in 1887 and a blue shirt with white sleeves between 1965 and 1973. Wednesday&#x27;s socks have been predominantly black, blue or white throughout their history.

The club&#x27;s away strip has changed regularly over the years. Traditionally, white was the second choice for many teams, including Wednesday, although the club has used a multitude of colours for its change strip over the years, including yellow, black, silver, green and orange.

===Crest===
Since 1912, the owl has become a theme that has run throughout the club. The original club crest was introduced in 1956 and consisted of a shield showing a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch. The White Rose of York was depicted below the branch alluding to the home county of Yorkshire and the of Sheffield &quot;(Sheaf field)&quot; were shown at either side of the owl&#x27;s head. The club&#x27;s Latin motto, &quot;Consilio et Animis&quot;, was displayed beneath the shield. This translates into English as &quot;By Wisdom and Courage&quot;.

The crest was changed in 1970 to a minimalist version designed by a local art student, and this logo was used by the club, with variations, until 1995, when it was replaced by a similar design to the original crest. It again featured a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch although the design of both had changed. The sheaves were replaced by a stylised &quot;SWFC&quot; logo that had been in use on club merchandise for several years prior to the introduction of the new crest. The Yorkshire Rose was moved to above the owl&#x27;s head to make way for the words &quot;Sheffield Wednesday&quot;. The word &quot;Hillsborough&quot; was also curved around the top of the design. The club motto was absent on the new design. The crest was encased in a new shape of shield. This crest remained in use for only a few years, during which several versions were used with different colours, including a white crest with blue stripes down either side and the colouring of the detail inverted.

In 1999, the minimalist version was brought back, albeit inside a crest, and with the addition of a copyright symbol in 2002. In 2016, new owner Dejphon Chansiri again changed the club crest, opting for a similar design to the 1956 badge.

===Mascots===

Over the years Sheffield Wednesday have had several Owl-themed matchday mascots. Originally it was Ozzie the Owl and later two further Owls, Baz &amp; Ollie, were added. All three were replaced in 2006 by Barney Owl, a similar looking owl but with more defined eyes to make it look cuter. Ozzie Owl was reintroduced as Wednesday&#x27;s main mascot during the home game with Charlton Athletic on 17 January 2009. The current mascots are Ozzie and Barney Owl. In 2012, Ollie Owl also made his return to the scene, as the club announced him Mascot for the Owls work with children in the local community.

==Stadium==

===Past stadiums===
Originally, Wednesday played matches at Highfield, but moved several times before adopting a permanent ground. Other locations included Myrtle Road, Heeley and Hunter&#x27;s Bar. Major matches were played at Sheaf House or Bramall Lane, before Sheffield United made it their home ground. Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s first permanent home ground was at Olive Grove, a site near Queen&#x27;s Road originally leased from the Duke of Norfolk. The first game at Olive Grove was a 4–4 draw with Blackburn Rovers on 12 September 1887. Extensions to the adjacent railway forced the club to move to their current ground in 1899.

===Hillsborough Stadium===
Since 1899 Wednesday have played their home games at Hillsborough Stadium in the Owlerton district of Sheffield. The stadium was originally named Owlerton Stadium but in 1914 Owlerton became part of the parliamentary constituency of Hillsborough and the ground took on its current name. With 39,732 seats, Hillsborough has the 12th highest capacity in England. The club had intended to increase Hillsborough&#x27;s capacity to 44,825 by 2012 and 50,000 by 2016 and make several other improvements in the process, but due to England&#x27;s failed World Cup bid, this is now not the case.

The stadium has hosted World Cup football in 1966, the 1996 European Championships and 27 FA Cup semi-finals. The Kop at Hillsborough was re-opened in 1986 by Queen Elizabeth II and was once the largest covered stand of any football stadium in Europe.

On 15 April 1989, at an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, 94 Liverpool fans (later increasing to 97) were crushed to death after the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of the ground became overcrowded, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. The following report concluded that the root cause of the disaster was the failure of local police to adequately manage the crowds. A memorial to the victims of the disaster stands outside Hillsborough&#x27;s South Stand, near the main entrance on Parkside Road. After many years of dispute about the facts, in June 2017 six men responsible for safety were charged with criminal offences including manslaughter and misconduct in public office.

==Supporters==

The club&#x27;s move to Owlerton in 1899 was a risky one, as it moved the club several miles away from the city centre, but its loyal followers continued to make the journey to the new ground, and the club has been one of the best supported in England ever since. However, official attendances were not taken at Football League games until the 1920s.

The club&#x27;s highest average attendance over the course of a season was 42,530 in 1952–53, when gates across the country were at their highest. The lowest average attendance in the Owls&#x27; history came in 1978–79, when an average of just 10,643 fans turned out to watch their side.

In 1992, Wednesday were the fourth best supported team in the country, but although that ranking has come down since relegation from the Premier League in 2000, the club still has still enjoyed crowds of well over 20,000 since then, and was the best supported club outside the top flight in 2006.

At the 2005 play-off final, Wednesday took over 39,000 fans to the Millennium Stadium. In 2016, Sheffield Wednesday took over 38,000 fans to Wembley for a play-off final defeat by Hull City. The Owls have managed to average 30,000 at home in the last 60 years. The FA Cup final seasons in 1965–66 30000 and 1966–67 31,000 plus 32,000 when coming League Championship runners-up in 1960–61.

Sheffield Wednesday have had a large variety of fanzines over the years; examples include &quot;Just Another Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, &quot;Spitting Feathers&quot;, &quot;Boddle&quot;, &quot;A View From The East Bank&quot;, &quot;Cheat!&quot; and &quot;War of the Monster Trucks&quot;, which acquired its name from the programme that Yorkshire Television elected to show instead of the celebrations after the 1991 League Cup victory over Manchester United.

There are several online message boards dedicated to discussions on the club, including &quot;Owlstalk&quot;, &quot;OwlsOnline&quot; and &quot;OwlsMad&quot;.

==Rivalry==

Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s main rivals are city neighbours Sheffield United. Matches between these two clubs are nicknamed Steel City derbies, so called because of the steel industry for which the city is famous.

United were formed in 1889 by the committee at Bramall Lane, who had lost their biggest source of income – Wednesday – two years earlier over a dispute concerning pitch rent. As well as playing at Wednesday&#x27;s former ground, United also took Wednesday&#x27;s former nickname, the Blades, as their own. The first derby game took place on 15 December 1890, with Wednesday winning 2–1 at Olive Grove.

The 1993 FA Cup semi-final match which took place at Wembley on 3 April 1993. Initially, it was announced that the match was scheduled to take place at Elland Road but this was met with dismay by both sets of fans. After a re-think, the Football Association decided to switch venue to Wembley. A crowd of 75,365 supporters made the trip to London to watch Wednesday beat United 2–1 after extra time.

A survey conducted in 2019 revealed that, as well as Sheffield United, Wednesday fans consider fellow-Yorkshire sides Leeds United, Barnsley, Rotherham United and Doncaster Rovers as rivals.

===Notable managers===
Only managers with over 200 games in charge are included. For the complete list see List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. managers.

Dickinson, who was in charge for 29 years, is Wednesday&#x27;s longest-serving manager, and helped establish the club during the first two decades of the 20th century.

Brown succeeded Dickinson and remained in charge for 13 years; in 1930 he secured their most recent top division league title to date.

Taylor took over during the Second World War and remained in charge until 1958, but failed to win a major trophy, even though Wednesday were in the top flight for most of his reign.

Charlton took Wednesday out of the Third Division in 1980 and in his final season (1982–83) he took them to the semi-finals of the FA Cup.

Wilkinson succeeded Charlton in the summer of 1983 and was in charge for more than five years before he moved to Leeds United. His first season saw Wednesday gain promotion to the First Division after a 14-year exile. He guided them to a fifth-place finish in 1986, but Wednesday were unable to compete in the 1986–87 UEFA Cup due to the ban on English teams in European competitions due to the Heysel Disaster of 1985.

Under Ron Atkinson, Wednesday won the League Cup and promotion to the First Division before departing for Aston Villa in July 1991. Trevor Francis was appointed as player-manager and guided them to third place in the league in 1992, and earned them a UEFA Cup place. They finished seventh in the inaugural Premier League season and were runners-up of the FA Cup and League Cup that year. He was sacked in 1995 after Wednesday finished 13th – their lowest standing in four years since winning promotion.

==Records and statistics==

Wednesday&#x27;s biggest recorded win was a 12–0 home victory over Halliwell in the first round of the FA Cup on 18 January 1891. The biggest league win was a 9–1 victory at home to Birmingham in the First Division on 13 December 1930. Wednesday&#x27;s heaviest defeat was a 10–0 defeat at Aston Villa in a First Division match on 5 October 1912.

The most goals scored by the club in a season was the 106 scored in the 1958–59 season. The club accumulated their highest league points total in the 2022–23 season when they racked up 96 points. The highest home attendance was in the FA Cup fifth round on 17 February 1934. A total of 72,841 turned up to see a 2–2 draw with Manchester City. The most-capped Englishman to play for the club was goalkeeper Ron Springett, who won 33 caps while at Sheffield Wednesday. Springett also held the overall record for most-capped Sheffield Wednesday player until Nigel Worthington broke the record, eventually gaining a total of 50 caps for Northern Ireland whilst at the club.

The fastest sending off in British league football is held by Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper Kevin Pressman – who was sent off after just 13 seconds for handling a shot from Wolverhampton Wanderers&#x27;s Temuri Ketsbaia outside the area during the opening weekend of 2000. The fastest shot ever recorded in the Premier League was hit by David Hirst against Arsenal at Highbury in September 1996 – Hirst hit the bar with a shot clocked at .

<text>Karl Schwarz (19 November 1812 – 25 March 1885) was a German Protestant theologian.

==Life==
===Birth and early life===
He was born at Wiek, Rügen. His father, Theodor Schwarz, pastor at Wiek, was well known as a preacher, and as the writer of a number of popular works (parables, romances, etc.) under the pseudonym &quot;Theodor Melas&quot;.

===University studies===
Karl Schwarz studied theology and philosophy at Halle, and afterwards at Bonn (1831) and Berlin (1832–1834). At Berlin he came under the influence of Schleiermacher and G. W. F. Hegel, whose influences are seen in his work &quot;Das Wesen der Religion&quot; (1847). In 1837 he was imprisoned for six months on account of his advanced political opinions. After his release he helped (from 1838) with the &quot;Hallische Jahrbücher&quot;.

===Later life and distinctions===
From 1843 to 1845, he lectured at Halle, and was then suspended by the government. In 1849, however, he was appointed professor extraordinarius, and later received a number of distinctions (in 1858 chief court preacher, etc.). Schwarz took an important part in the founding and directing of the German &quot;Protestantenverein&quot; and became an eminent exponent of liberal theology. His work &quot;Zur Geschichte der neuesten Theologie&quot; (1856, 4th edition 1869) is a valuable source for the history of theology in Germany. His other works include &quot;Lessing als Theologe&quot; (1854) and &quot;Grundriss der christlichen Lehre&quot; (1873, 5th edition 1876). In his memory, a Karl-Schwarz-Stiftung was founded in connection with the theological faculty at the University of Jena.

<doc id="177541" wikidata="Q580867" url="?curid=177541" title="Space Shuttle Columbia disaster">
<text>On Saturday, February 1, 2003, Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated as it re-entered the atmosphere over Texas and Louisiana, killing all seven astronauts on board. It was the second Space Shuttle mission to end in disaster, after the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot; and crew in 1986.

The mission, designated STS-107, was the twenty-eighth flight for the orbiter, the 113th flight of the Space Shuttle fleet and the 88th after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. It was dedicated to research in various fields, mainly on board the SpaceHab module inside the shuttle&#x27;s payload bay. During launch, a piece of the insulating foam broke off from the Space Shuttle external tank and struck the thermal protection system tiles on the orbiter&#x27;s left wing. Similar foam shedding had occurred during previous Space Shuttle launches, causing damage that ranged from minor to near-catastrophic, but some engineers suspected that the damage to &quot;Columbia&quot; was more serious. Before reentry, NASA managers limited the investigation, reasoning that the crew could not have fixed the problem if it had been confirmed. When &quot;Columbia&quot; reentered the atmosphere of Earth, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the heat shield and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the orbiter to become unstable and break apart.

After the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years, as they had been after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was paused until flights resumed in July2005 with STS-114. NASA made several technical and organizational changes to subsequent missions, including adding an on-orbit inspection to determine how well the orbiter&#x27;s thermal protection system (TPS) had endured the ascent, and keeping designated rescue missions ready in case irreparable damage was found. Except for one mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope, subsequent Space Shuttle missions were flown only to the ISS to allow the crew to use it as a haven if damage to the orbiter prevented safe reentry. The remaining three orbiters were retired after the building of the ISS was completed.

== Background ==

=== Space Shuttle ===


The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable spacecraft operated by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). It flew in space for the first time in April1981, and was used to conduct in-orbit research, and deploy commercial, military, and scientific payloads. At launch, it consisted of the orbiter, which contained the crew and payload, the external tank (ET), and the two solid rocket boosters (SRBs). The orbiter was a reusable, winged vehicle that launched vertically and landed as a glider. Five operational orbiters were built during the Space Shuttle program. was the first space-rated orbiter constructed, following the atmospheric test vehicle . The orbiter contained the crew compartment, where the crew predominantly lived and worked throughout a mission. Three Space Shuttle main engines (SSMEs) were mounted at the aft end of the orbiter and provided thrust during launch. Once in space, the crew maneuvered using the two smaller, aft-mounted Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines.

The orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), a thermal soaking protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield. During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to , but had to keep the orbiter vehicle&#x27;s aluminum skin temperature below . The TPS primarily consisted of four sub-systems. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above , and were protected by the composite material reinforced carbon–carbon (RCC). Thicker RCC was developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from micrometeoroid and orbital debris. The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with black high-temperature reusable surface insulation. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were covered with white low-temperature reusable surface insulation, which provided protection at temperatures below . The payload bay doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were covered with reusable felt surface insulation, as the temperature there remained below .

Two solid rocket boosters (SRBs) were connected to the ET, and burned for the first two minutes of flight. The SRBs separated from the ET once they had expended their fuel and fell into the Atlantic Ocean under a parachute. NASA retrieval teams recovered the SRBs and returned them to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), where they were disassembled and their components were reused on future flights.

When the Space Shuttle launched, the orbiter and SRBs were connected to the ET, which held the fuel for the SSMEs. The ET consisted of a tank for liquid hydrogen (LH2), stored at and a smaller tank for liquid oxygen (LOX), stored at . It was covered in insulating foam to keep the liquids cold and prevent ice forming on the tank&#x27;s exterior. The orbiter connected to the ET via two umbilicals near its bottom and a bipod near its top section.
After its fuel had been expended, the ET separated from the orbiter and reentered the atmosphere, where it would break apart during reentry and its pieces would land in the Indian or Pacific Ocean.

=== Debris strike concerns ===
During the design process of the Space Shuttle, a requirement of the ET was that it would not release any debris that could potentially damage the orbiter and its TPS. The integrity of the TPS components was necessary for the survival of the crew during reentry, and the tiles and panels were only built to withstand relatively minor impacts. On STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle, the orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot; was damaged during its launch from a foam strike. Foam strikes occurred regularly during Space Shuttle launches; of the 79 missions with available imagery during launch, foam strikes occurred on 65 of them.

The bipod connected the ET near the top to the front underside of the orbiter via two struts with a ramp at the tank end of each strut; the ramps were covered in foam to prevent ice from forming that could damage the orbiter. The foam on each bipod ramp was approximately , and was carved by hand from the original foam application. Bipod ramp foam from the left strut had been observed falling off the ET on six flights prior to STS-107, and had created some of the largest foam strikes that the orbiter experienced. The first bipod ramp foam strike occurred during STS-7; the orbiter&#x27;s TPS was repaired after the mission but no changes were made to address the cause of the bipod foam loss. After bipod foam loss on STS-32, NASA engineers, under the assumption that the foam loss was due to pressure buildup within the insulation, added vent holes to the foam to allow gas to escape. After a bipod foam strike damaged the TPS on STS-50, internal NASA investigations concluded it was an &quot;accepted flight risk&quot; and that it should not be treated as a flight safety issue. Bipod foam loss occurred on STS-52 and STS-62, but neither event was noticed until the investigation following &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s destruction.

During STS-112, which flew in October 2002, a chunk of bipod ramp foam broke away from the ET bipod ramp and hit the SRB-ET attachment ring near the bottom of the left SRB, creating a dent wide and deep. Following the mission, the Program Requirements Control Board declined to categorize the bipod ramp foam loss as an in-flight anomaly. The foam loss was briefed at the STS-113 Flight Readiness Brief, but the Program Requirements Control Board decided that the ET was safe to fly.

A debris strike from the ablative material on the right SRB caused significant damage to during the STS-27 launch on December 2, 1988. On the second day of the flight the crew inspected the damage using a camera on the remote manipulator system. The debris strike had removed a tile; the exposed orbiter skin was a reinforced section, and a burn-through might have occurred had the damage been in a different location. After the mission, the NASA Program Requirements Control Board designated the issue as an in-flight anomaly that was corrected with the planned improvement for the SRB ablator.

== Flight ==

=== Space Shuttle mission ===
For STS-107, &quot;Columbia&quot; carried the SpaceHab Research Double Module, the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment, and an Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. The mission passed its pre-launch certifications and reviews, and began with the launch. The mission was originally scheduled to launch on January 11, 2001, but it was delayed thirteen times, until its launch on January 16, 2003.

The seven-member crew of STS-107 were selected in July 2000. The mission was commanded by Rick Husband, who was a colonel in the U.S. Air Force and a test pilot. He had previously flown on STS-96. The mission&#x27;s pilot was William McCool, a U.S. Navy commander who was on his first spaceflight. The payload commander was Michael Anderson, a U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel who had previously flown on STS-89. Kalpana Chawla served as the flight engineer; she had previously flown on STS-87. David Brown and Laurel Clark, both Navy captains, flew as the mission specialists on their first spaceflights. Ilan Ramon, a colonel in the Israeli Air Force and the first Israeli astronaut, flew as a payload specialist on his first spaceflight.

=== Launch and debris strike ===

&quot;Columbia&quot; was launched from the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at 10:39:00am. At T+81.7seconds, a piece of foam approximately long and wide broke off from the left bipod on the ET. At T+81.9seconds, the foam struck the reinforced carbon–carbon (RCC) panels on &quot;Columbia&quot;″s left wing at relative velocity of . The foam&#x27;s low ballistic coefficient caused it to lose speed immediately after separating from the ET, and the orbiter ran into the slower foam. Neither the mission nor ground crew noticed the debris strike at the time. The SRBs separated from the ET at T+2minutes and 7seconds, followed by the ET&#x27;s separation from the orbiter at T+8minutes 30seconds. The ET separation was photographed by Anderson and recorded by Brown, but they did not record the bipod with missing foam. At T+43minutes, &quot;Columbia&quot; completed its orbital insertion as planned.

=== Flight risk management ===
After &quot;Columbia&quot; entered orbit, the NASA Intercenter Photo Working Group conducted a routine review of videos of the launch. The group&#x27;s analysts did not notice the debris strike until the second day of the mission. None of the cameras that recorded the launch had a clear view of the debris striking the wing, leaving the group unable to determine the level of damage sustained by the orbiter. The group&#x27;s chair contacted Wayne Hale, the Shuttle Program Manager for Launch Integration, to request on-orbit pictures of &quot;Columbia&quot;″s wing to assess its damage. After receiving notification of the debris strike, engineers at NASA, United Space Alliance, and Boeing created the Debris Assessment Team and began working to determine the damage to the orbiter. Intercenter Photo Working Group believed that the orbiter&#x27;s RCC tiles were possibly damaged; NASA program managers were less concerned over the danger caused by the debris strike.

Boeing analysts attempted to model the damage caused to the orbiter&#x27;s TPS from the foam strike. The software models predicted damage that was deeper than the thickness of the TPS tiles, indicating that the orbiter&#x27;s aluminum skin would be unprotected in that area. The Debris Assessment Team dismissed this conclusion as inaccurate, because of previous instances of predictions of damage greater than the actual damage. Further modeling specific to the RCC panels used software calibrated to predict damage caused by falling ice. The software predicted only one of 15 scenarios that ice would cause damage, leading the Debris Assessment Team to conclude there was minimal damage due to the lower density of foam to ice.
To assess the possible damage to &quot;Columbia&quot;″s wing, members of the Debris Assessment Team made multiple requests to get imagery of the orbiter from the Department of Defense (DoD). Imagery requests were channeled through both the DoD Manned Space Flight Support Office and the Johnson Space Center Engineering Directorate. Hale coordinated the request through a DoD representative at KSC. The request was relayed to the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), which began identifying imaging assets that could observe the orbiter. The imagery request was soon rescinded by NASA Mission Management Team Chair Linda Ham after she investigated the origin of it. She had consulted with Flight Director Phil Engelauf and members of the Mission Management Team, who stated that they did not have a requirement for imagery of &quot;Columbia&quot;. Ham did not consult with the Debris Assessment Team, and cancelled the imagery request on the basis that it had not been made through official channels. Maneuvering the orbiter to allow its left wing to be imaged would have interrupted ongoing science operations, and Ham dismissed the DoD imaging capabilities as insufficient to assess damage to the orbiter. Following the rejection of their imagery request, the Debris Assessment Team did not make further requests for the orbiter to be imaged.

Throughout the flight, members of the Mission Management Team were less concerned than the Debris Assessment Team about the potential risk of a debris strike. The loss of bipod foam on STS-107 was compared to previous foam strike events, none of which caused the loss of an orbiter or crew. Ham, scheduled to work as an integration manager for STS-114, was concerned with the potential delays from a foam loss event. Mission management also downplayed the risk of the debris strike in communications with the crew. On January 23, flight director Steve Stich sent an e-mail to Husband and McCool to tell them about the foam strike and inform them there was no cause for concern about damage to the TPS, as foam strikes had occurred on previous flights.
The crew were also sent a fifteen-second video of the debris strike in preparation for a press conference, but were reassured that there were no safety concerns.

On January 26, the Debris Assessment Team concluded that there were no safety concerns from the debris strike. The team&#x27;s report was critical of the Mission Management Team for asserting that there were no safety concerns before the Debris Assessment Team&#x27;s investigation had been completed. On January 29, William Readdy, the Associate Administrator for Space Flight, agreed to DoD imaging of the orbiter, but on the condition that it would not interfere with flight operations; ultimately, the orbiter was not imaged by the DoD during the flight. At a Mission Management Team on January 31, the day before &quot;Columbia&quot; reentered the atmosphere, the Launch Integration Office voiced Ham&#x27;s intention to review on-board footage to view the missing foam, but concerns of crew safety were not discussed.

=== Reentry ===
&quot;Columbia&quot; was scheduled to reenter the atmosphere and land on February 1, 2003. At 3:30am EST the Entry Flight Control Team started its shift at the Mission Control Center. On board the orbiter, the crew stowed loose items and prepared their equipment for reentry.

At 45 minutes before the deorbit burn, Husband and McCool began working through the entry checklist. At 8:10am the Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM), Charlie Hobaugh, informed the crew that they were approved to conduct the deorbit burn. At 8:15:30the crew successfully executed the deorbit burn, which lasted 2minutes and 38seconds. At 8:44:09&quot;Columbia&quot; reentered the atmosphere at an altitude of , a point named entry interface. The damage to the TPS on the orbiter&#x27;s left wing allowed for hot air to enter and begin melting the aluminum structure. Four and a half minutes after entry interface, a sensor began recording greater-than-normal amounts of strain on the left wing; the sensor&#x27;s data was recorded to internal storage and not transmitted to the crew or ground controllers. The orbiter began to turn (yaw) to the left as a result of the increased drag on the left wing, but this was not noticed by the crew or mission control because of corrections from the orbiter&#x27;s flight control system. This was followed by sensors in the left wheel well reporting a rise in temperature.
At 8:53:46 am, &quot;Columbia&quot; crossed over the California coast; it was traveling at Mach23 at an altitude of , and the temperature of its wings&#x27; leading edges was estimated to be . Soon after it entered California airspace, the orbiter shed several pieces of debris, events observed on the ground as sudden increases in brightness of the air around the orbiter. The MMACS officer reported that the hydraulic sensors in the left wing had readings below the sensors&#x27; minimum detection thresholds at 8:54:24am. &quot;Columbia&quot; continued its reentry and traveled over Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, where observers would report seeing signs of debris being shed.

At 8:58:03, the orbiter&#x27;s aileron trim changed from the predicted values because of the increasing drag caused by the damage to the left wing. At 8:58:21, the orbiter shed a TPS tile that would later land in Littlefield, Texas; it would become the westernmost piece of recovered debris. The crew first received an indication of a problem at 8:58:39, when the Backup Flight Software monitor began displaying fault messages for a loss of pressure in the tires of the left landing gear. The pilot and commander then received indications that the status of the left landing gear was unknown, as different sensors reported the gear was down and locked or in the stowed position. The drag of the left wing continued to yaw the orbiter to the left until it could no longer be corrected using aileron trim. The orbiter&#x27;s Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters began firing continuously to correct its orientation.

The loss of signal (LOS) from &quot;Columbia&quot; occurred at 8:59:32. Mission control stopped receiving information from the orbiter at this time, and Husband&#x27;s last radio call of &quot;Roger, uh...&quot; was cut off mid-transmission. One of the channels in the flight control system was bypassed as the result of a failed wire, and a Master Alarm began sounding on the flight deck. Loss of control of the orbiter is estimated to have begun several seconds later with a loss of hydraulic pressure and an uncontrolled pitch-up maneuver. The orbiter began flying along a ballistic trajectory, which was significantly steeper and had more drag than the previous gliding trajectory. The orbiter, while still traveling faster than Mach 15, entered into a flat spin of 30° to 40° per second. The acceleration that the crew was experiencing increased from approximately 0.8 g to 3g, which would have likely caused dizziness and disorientation, but not incapacitation. The autopilot was switched to manual control and reset to automatic mode at 9:00:03; this would have required the input of either Husband or McCool, indicating that they were still conscious and able to perform functions at the time. All hydraulic pressure was lost, and McCool&#x27;s final switch configurations indicate that he had tried to restore the hydraulic systems at some time after 9:00:05.
At 9:00:18, the orbiter began a catastrophic breakup, and all on-board data recording soon ceased. Ground observers noted a sudden increase in debris being shed, and all on-board systems lost power. By 9:00:25, the orbiter&#x27;s fore and aft sections had separated from one another. The sudden jerk caused the crew compartment to collide with the interior wall of the fuselage, resulting in the start of depressurization of the crew compartment by 9:00:35. The pieces of the orbiter continued to break apart into smaller pieces, and within a minute after breakup were too small to be detected by ground-based videos. A NASA report estimates that by 9:35, all crew remains and a majority of debris had hit the ground.

The loss of signal occurred at a time when the Flight Control Team expected brief communication outages as the orbiter stopped communication via the west tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS). Personnel in Mission Control were unaware of the in-flight break-up, and continued to try to reestablish contact with the orbiter. At around 9:12:39, when &quot;Columbia&quot; would have been conducting its final maneuvers to land, a Mission Control member received a phone call concerning news coverage of the orbiter breaking up. This information was immediately passed on to the Entry Flight Director, LeRoy Cain, who initiated contingency procedures. At KSC, where &quot;Columbia&quot; had been expected to land at 9:16, NASA Associate Administrator and former astronaut William Readdy also began contingency procedures after the orbiter did not land as scheduled.

=== Crew survivability ===
During reentry, all seven of the STS-107 crew members were killed, but the exact time of their deaths could not be determined. The level of acceleration that they experienced during crew module breakup was not lethal. The first lethal event the crew experienced was the depressurization of the crew module. The rate and exact time of complete depressurization could not be determined, but it occurred no later than 9:00:59 and was likely much earlier. The remains of the crew members indicated they all experienced depressurization. The astronauts&#x27; helmets have a visor that, when closed, can temporarily protect the crew member from depressurization. None of the crew members had closed their visors, and one was not wearing a helmet; this would indicate that depressurization occurred quickly before they could take protective measures. They were rendered unconscious or deceased within seconds and tissue damage was extensive enough that they could not have regained consciousness even if the cabin had regained pressurization.

During and after the breakup of the crew module, the crew, either unconscious or dead, experienced rotation on all three axes. The astronauts&#x27; shoulder harnesses were unable to prevent trauma to their upper bodies, as the inertia reel system failed to retract sufficiently to secure them, leaving them only restrained by their lap belts. The helmets were not conformal to the crew members&#x27; heads, allowing head injuries to occur inside of the helmet. The neck ring of the helmet may have also acted as a fulcrum that caused spine and neck injuries. The physical trauma to the astronauts, who could not brace to prevent such injuries, also could have resulted in their deaths.

The astronauts also likely suffered from significant thermal trauma. Hot gas entered the disintegrating crew module, burning the crew members, whose bodies were still somewhat protected by their ACES suits. Once the crew module fell apart, the astronauts were violently exposed to windblast and a possible shock wave, which stripped their suits from their bodies. The crews&#x27; remains were exposed to hot gas and molten metal as they fell away from the orbiter.

After separation from the crew module, the bodies of the crew members entered an environment with almost no oxygen, very low atmospheric pressure, and both high temperatures caused by deceleration, and extremely low ambient temperatures. Their bodies hit the ground with lethal force.

== Presidential response ==

At 14:04 EST (19:04 UTC), President George W. Bush said in a televised address to the nation, &quot;My fellow Americans, this day has brought terrible news, and great sadness to our country. At 9:00 a.m. this morning, Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. A short time later, debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas. The &quot;Columbia&quot; is lost; there are no survivors.&quot;

== Recovery of debris ==

After the orbiter broke up, reports came in to eastern Texas law enforcement agencies of an explosion and falling debris. Astronauts Mark Kelly and Gregory Johnson traveled on a US Coast Guard helicopter from Houston to Nacogdoches, and Jim Wetherbee drove a team of astronauts to Lufkin to assist with recovery efforts. Debris was reported from east Texas through southern Louisiana. Recovery crews and local volunteers worked to locate and identify debris.

On the first day of the disaster, searchers began finding remains of the astronauts. Within three days of the crash, some remains from every crew member had been recovered. These recoveries occurred along a line south of Hemphill, Texas, and west of the Toledo Bend Reservoir. The final body of a crew member was recovered on February 11. The crew remains were transported to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology at Dover Air Force Base.

Immediately after the disaster, the Texas Army National Guard deployed 300 members to assist with security and recovery, and the Coast Guard Gulf Strike Team was assigned to help recover hazardous debris. Over the following days, the search grew to include hundreds of individuals from the Environmental Protection Agency, US Forest Service, Civil Air Patrol, and Texas and Louisiana public safety organizations, as well as local volunteers. In the months after the disaster, the largest-ever organized ground search took place. NASA officials warned of the dangers of handling debris, as it could have been contaminated by propellants.

Soon after the accident, some individuals attempted to sell &quot;Columbia&quot; debris on the internet, including on the online auction website eBay. Officials at NASA were critical of these efforts, as the debris was NASA property and was needed for the investigation. A three-day amnesty period was offered for recovered orbiter debris. During this time, about 20 individuals contacted NASA to return debris, which included debris from the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. After the end of the amnesty period, several individuals were arrested for illegal looting and possession of debris.

&quot;Columbia&quot;″s flight data recorder was found near Hemphill, Texas, southeast of Nacogdoches, on March 19, 2003. &quot;Columbia&quot; was the first orbiter, and it had a unique flight data OEX (Orbiter EXperiments) recorder to record vehicle performance data during the test flights. The recorder was left in &quot;Columbia&quot; after the initial Shuttle test-flights were completed, and began recording information 15 minutes prior to reentry. The tape it recorded to was broken at the time of the crash, but information from the orbiter&#x27;s sensors could have been recorded beforehand. Several days later, the tape was sent to the Imation Corporation for it to be inspected and cleaned. On March 25, the OEX&#x27;s tape was sent to KSC, where it was copied and analyzed.

On March 27, a Bell 407 helicopter that was being used in the debris search crashed due to mechanical failure in the Angelina National Forest. The crash killed the pilot, Jules F. Mier Jr., and a Texas Forest Service aviation specialist, Charles Krenek, and injured three other crew members.

A group of &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; worms, enclosed in aluminum canisters, survived reentry and impact with the ground and were recovered weeks after the disaster. The culture, which was part of an experiment to research their growth while consuming synthetic nutrients, was found to be alive on April 28, 2003.

NASA management selected the Reusable Launch Vehicle hangar at KSC to reconstruct recovered &quot;Columbia&quot; debris. NASA Launch Director Michael Leinbach led the reconstruction team, which was staffed by &quot;Columbia&quot; engineers and technicians. Debris was laid out on the floor of the hangar in the shape of the orbiter to allow investigators to look for patterns in the damage that indicated the cause of the disaster. Astronaut Pamela Melroy was assigned to oversee the six-person team reconstructing the crew compartment, which included fellow astronaut Marsha Ivins.

Recovered debris was shipped from the field to KSC, where it was unloaded and checked to see if it was contaminated by toxic hypergolic propellants. Each piece of debris had an identifying number and a tag indicating the coordinates where it was found. Staff attached photographs and catalogued each piece of debris. Recovered debris from inside the orbiter was placed in a separate area, as it was not considered to be a contributor to the accident. NASA conducted a fault tree analysis to determine the probable causes of the accident, and focused its investigations on the parts of the orbiter most likely to have been responsible for the in-flight breakup. Engineers in the hangar analyzed the debris to determine how the orbiter came apart. Even though the crew compartment was not considered as a likely cause of the accident, Melroy successfully argued for its analysis to learn more about how its safety systems helped, or failed to help, the crew survive. The tiles on the left wing were studied to determine the nature of the burning and melting that occurred. The damage to the debris indicated that the breach began at the wing&#x27;s leading edge, allowing hot gas to get past the orbiter&#x27;s thermal protection system.

The search for &quot;Columbia&quot; debris ended in May. Approximately 83,900 pieces of debris were recovered, weighing , which was about 38 percent of the orbiter&#x27;s overall weight. When the CAIB report was released, about 40,000 recovered pieces of debris had not been identified. All recovered non-human &quot;Columbia&quot; debris was stored in unused office space at the Vehicle Assembly Building, except for parts of the crew compartment, which were kept separate. By the end of reconstruction efforts only 720 items remained classified as unknown.

In July 2011, lower water levels caused by a drought revealed a piece of debris in Lake Nacogdoches. NASA identified the piece as a power reactant storage and distribution tank.
== &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board ==
About ninety minutes after the disaster, NASA Administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe called to convene the &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) to determine the cause. It was chaired by retired U.S. Navy Admiral Harold W. Gehman, Jr. and included military and civilian analysts. It initially consisted of eight members, including Gehman, but expanded to 13 members by March. The CAIB members were notified by noon on the day of the accident, and participated in a teleconference that evening. The following day, they traveled to Barksdale AFB to begin the investigation. The CAIB members first toured the debris fields, and then established their operations at JSC. The CAIB established four teams to investigate NASA management and program safety, NASA training and crew operations, the technical aspects of the disaster, and how NASA culture affected the Space Shuttle program. These groups collaborated, and hired other support staff to investigate. The CAIB worked alongside the reconstruction efforts to determine the cause of the accident, and interviewed members of the Space Shuttle program, including those who had been involved with STS-107. The CAIB conducted public hearings from March until June, and released its final report in August 2003.

=== Cause of the accident ===
After looking at sensor data, the CAIB considered damage to the left wing as a likely culprit for &quot;Columbia&quot;″s destruction. It investigated that recovered debris and noted the difference in heat damage between the two wings. RCC panels from the left wing were found in the western portion of the debris field, indicating that it was shed first before the rest of the orbiter disintegrated. X-ray and chemical analysis was conducted on the RCC panels, revealing the highest levels of slag deposits to be in the left wing tiles. Impact testing was conducted at the Southwest Research Institute, using a nitrogen-powered gun to fire a projectile made of the same material as the ET bipod foam. Panels taken from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, , and Atlantis were used to determine the projectiles&#x27; effect on RCC panels. A test on RCC panel8, taken from &quot;Atlantis&quot;, was the most consistent with the damage observed on &quot;Columbia&quot;, indicating it was the damaged panel that led to the in-flight breakup.

=== Organizational culture ===
The CAIB was critical of NASA organizational culture, and compared its current state to that of NASA leading up to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. It concluded that NASA was experiencing budget constraints while still expecting to keep a high level of launches and operations. Program operating costs were lowered by 21% from 1991 to 1994, despite a planned increase in the yearly flight rate for assembly of the International Space Station. Despite a history of foam strike events, NASA management did not consider the potential risk to the astronauts as a safety-of-flight issue. The CAIB found that a lack of a safety program led to the lack of concern over foam strikes. The board determined that NASA lacked the appropriate communication and integration channels to allow problems to be discussed and effectively routed and addressed. This risk was further compounded by pressure to adhere to a launch schedule for construction of the ISS.

=== Possible emergency procedures ===
In its report, the CAIB discussed potential options that could have saved &quot;Columbia&quot;″s crew. They determined that the mission could have been extended to at most 30 days (February 15), after which the lithium hydroxide canisters used to remove carbon dioxide would have run out. On STS-107, &quot;Columbia&quot; was carrying the Extended Duration Orbiter, which increased its supply of oxygen and hydrogen. To maximize the mission duration, non-essential systems would have been powered down, and animals in the Spacehab module would have been euthanized.

When STS-107 launched, &quot;Atlantis&quot; was undergoing preparation for the STS-114 launch on March 1, 2003. Had NASA management decided to launch a rescue mission, an expedited process could have begun to launch it as a rescue vehicle. Some pre-launch tests would have been eliminated to allow it to launch on time. &quot;Atlantis&quot; would have launched with additional equipment for EVAs, and launched with a minimum required crew. It would have rendezvoused with &quot;Columbia&quot;, and the STS-107 crew would have conducted EVAs to transfer to &quot;Atlantis&quot;. &quot;Columbia&quot; would have been remotely deorbited; as Mission Control would have been unable to remotely land it, it would have been disposed of in the Pacific Ocean.

The CAIB also investigated the possibility of on-orbit repair of the left wing. Although there were no materials or adhesives onboard &quot;Columbia&quot; that could have survived reentry, the board researched the effectiveness of stuffing materials from the orbiter, crew cabin, or water into the RCC hole. They determined that the best option would have been to harvest tiles from other places on the orbiter, shape them, and then stuff them into the RCC hole. Given the difficulty of on-orbit repair and the risk of further damaging the RCC tiles, the CAIB determined that the likelihood of a successful on-orbit repair would have been low.

== NASA response ==
=== Space Shuttle updates ===
The Space Shuttle program was suspended after the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot;. The further construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was delayed, as the Space Shuttle had been scheduled for seven missions to the ISS in 2003 and 2004 to complete its construction.
To prevent future foam strikes, the ET was redesigned to remove foam from the bipod. Instead, electric heaters were installed to prevent ice building up in the bipod due to the cold liquid oxygen in its feedlines. Additional heaters were also installed along the liquid oxygen line, which ran from the base of the tank to its interstage section. NASA also improved its ground imaging capabilities at Kennedy Space Center to better observe and monitor potential issues that occur during launch. The existing cameras at LC-39A, LC-39B, and along the coast were upgraded, and nine new camera sites were added. Cameras were added to the bellies of &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Endeavour&quot; (only &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Challenger&quot; had them prior) to allow digital images of the ET to be viewed on the ground soon after launch. The prior system on &quot;Columbia&quot; used film and could only be downlinked after the orbiter returned to Earth. The Orbiter Boom Sensor System, a camera on the end of the Canadarm, was added to allow the crew to inspect the orbiter for any tile damage once they reached orbit. Each of the orbiter&#x27;s wings was equipped with 22 temperature sensors to detect any breaches during reentry and with 66 accelerometers to detect an impact. Post-landing inspection procedures were updated to include technicians examining the RCC panels using flash thermography.

As well as the updates to the orbiter, NASA prepared contingency plans in the event that a mission would be unable to safely land. The plan involved the stranded mission docking with the ISS, on which the crew would inspect and attempt to repair the damaged orbiter. If they were unsuccessful, they would remain aboard the ISS and wait for a rescue. The rescue mission, designated STS-3xx, would be activated, and would use the next-in-line hardware for the orbiter, ET, and SRBs. The expected time to launch would be 35 days, as that was the requirement to prepare launch facilities. Before the arrival of the rescue mission, the stranded crew would power up the damaged orbiter, which would be remotely controlled as it was undocked and deorbited, and its debris would land in the Pacific Ocean. The minimal crew would launch, dock with the ISS, and spend a day transferring astronauts and equipment before undocking and landing.

=== First Return to Flight mission (STS-114) ===

The first Return to Flight mission, STS-114, began with the launch of &quot;Discovery&quot; on July 26, 2005, at 10:39am (EDT). Sixteen pieces of foam from the ET were dislodged during the launch that were large enough to be considered significant by NASA investigators, including one piece that was approximately . Post-launch investigations did not find any indications of damage from the foam loss, but ET video did reveal that a small piece of TPS tile from the nose landing gear fell off during launch. Upon reaching orbit the crew inspected &quot;Discovery&quot; with the Orbiter Boom Sensor System. On July 29 &quot;Discovery&quot; rendezvoused with the ISS and, before docking, performed the first rendezvous pitch maneuver to allow the crew aboard the ISS to observe and photograph the orbiter&#x27;s belly. The next day, astronauts Soichi Noguchi and Stephen Robinson performed the first of three spacewalks. They tested a tile repair tool, the Emittance Wash Applicator, on intentionally damaged TPS tiles that had been brought in the payload bay. On August 3 the same astronauts performed the third EVA of the mission, during which Robinson stood on the ISS&#x27;s Canadarm2 and went to &quot;Discovery&quot;″s belly to remove two gap fillers between tiles that had begun to protrude. After a delay due to bad weather at KSC, the decision was made to land at Edwards AFB. &quot;Discovery&quot; successfully landed at 8:11am (EDT) on August 9. Had &quot;Discovery&quot; been unable to safely land, the crew would have remained on the ISS until &quot;Atlantis&quot; was flown to rescue them. As a result of the foam loss, NASA grounded the Space Shuttle fleet again.

=== Second Return to Flight mission (STS-121) ===
To address the problem of foam loss for the second Return to Flight mission (STS-121), NASA engineers removed the foam ramp from the protuberance air load (PAL) on the ET, which was the source of the largest piece of debris on STS-114. The launch was postponed from its scheduled launch of July 1, 2006, and again on July 2 due to inclement weather at KSC. On July 3 a piece of foam approximately and weighing broke off from the ET. The mission still launched as scheduled at 2:38pm (EDT) on July 4. After reaching orbit, &quot;Discovery&quot; performed post-launch inspections of its TPS and docked with the ISS on July 6. The orbiter carried a remote control orbiter in-flight maintenance cable that could connect the flight deck systems to the avionics system in the mid-deck; it would allow the spacecraft to be landed remotely, to include controlling the landing gear and deploying the parachute. On July 12 astronauts Piers Sellers and Michael Fossum performed an EVA to test the NonOxide Adhesive eXperiment (NOAX), which applied protective sealant to samples of damaged TPS tiles. &quot;Discovery&quot; undocked from the ISS on July 14 and safely landed at 9:14am on July 17 at KSC. Had the crew been stranded in orbit, NASA planned to launch &quot;Atlantis&quot; to rescue them from the ISS.

=== Program cancellation ===
In January 2004 President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration, calling for the Space Shuttle fleet to complete the ISS and be retired by 2010, to be replaced by a newly developed Crew Exploration Vehicle for travel to the Moon and Mars. In 2004, NASA Administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe canceled a planned servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope and decided that future missions would all rendezvous with the ISS to ensure the safety of the crew. In 2006, his successor, Michael Griffin, decided to have one more servicing mission to the telescope, STS-125, which flew in May 2009. The retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed until 2011, after which no further crewed spacecraft were launched from the United States until 2020 when SpaceX&#x27;s Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission successfully carried NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken to the ISS.

== Legacy ==


On February 4, 2003, President Bush and his wife Laura led a memorial service for the astronauts&#x27; families at the Johnson Space Center. Two days later, Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne led a similar service at Washington National Cathedral. Patti LaBelle sang &quot;Way Up There&quot; as part of the service. A memorial service was held at KSC on February 7; Robert Crippen, the first pilot of &quot;Columbia&quot;, gave a eulogy for the crew and a tribute for &quot;Columbia&quot; herself, acknowledging her achievements as the first orbiter and NASA&#x27;s flagship, her role in trying desperately to save the crew on STS-107, and her many missions dedicated to scientific research. On October 28, 2003, the names of the crew were added to the Space Mirror Memorial at the KSC Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida, alongside the names of 17 other astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the line of duty. On February 2, 2004, NASA Administrator O&#x27;Keefe unveiled a memorial for the STS-107 crew at Arlington National Cemetery, and it is located near the &quot;Challenger&quot; memorial. A tree for each astronaut was planted in NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Memorial Grove at the Johnson Space Center, along with trees for each astronaut from the Apollo 1 and &quot;Challenger&quot; disasters. The exhibit &quot;Forever Remembered&quot; at KSC Visitor Complex features the cockpit window frames from &quot;Columbia&quot;. In 2004, Bush conferred posthumous Congressional Space Medals of Honor to all 14 crew members killed in the &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; accidents.

NASA named several places in honor of &quot;Columbia&quot; and the crew. Seven asteroids discovered in July 2001 were named after astronauts: 51823 Rickhusband, 51824 Mikeanderson, 51825 Davidbrown, 51826 Kalpanachawla, 51827 Laurelclark, 51828 Ilanramon, 51829 Williemccool. On Mars, the landing site of the rover &quot;Spirit&quot; was named &quot;Columbia&quot; Memorial Station, and included a memorial plaque to the &quot;Columbia&quot; crew mounted on the back of the high gain antenna. A complex of seven hills east of the &quot;Spirit&quot; landing site was dubbed the Columbia Hills; each of the seven hills was individually named for a member of the crew, and the rover explored the summit of Husband Hill in 2005. In 2006, the IAU approved naming seven lunar craters after the astronauts.

In February 2006, NASA&#x27;s National Scientific Balloon Facility was renamed the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility. A supercomputer built in 2004 at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division was named &quot;Columbia&quot;. The first part of the system, named &quot;Kalpana&quot;, was dedicated to Chawla, who had worked at the Ames Research Center before joining the Space Shuttle program. The first dedicated meteorological satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Metsat-1, was renamed to Kalpana-1 on February 5, 2003, after Chawla.

In 2003, the airport in Amarillo, Texas, where Husband was from, was renamed to the Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport. A mountain peak in the Sangre de Cristo Range in the Colorado Rockies was renamed Columbia Point in 2003. In October 2004, both houses of Congress passed a resolution to change the name of Downey, California&#x27;s Space Science Learning Center to the Columbia Memorial Space Center, which is located at the former manufacturing site of the Space Shuttle orbiters.

On April 1, 2003, the Opening Day of baseball season, the Houston Astros honored the &quot;Columbia&quot; crew by having seven simultaneous first pitches thrown by family and friends of the crew. During the singing of the national anthem, 107 NASA personnel carried a U.S. flag onto the field. The Astros wore the mission patch on their sleeves the entire season. On February 1, 2004, the first anniversary of the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, Super Bowl XXXVIII held in Houston&#x27;s Reliant Stadium began with a pregame tribute to the crew of the &quot;Columbia&quot; by singer Josh Groban performing &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, with the crew of STS-114 in attendance.

In 2004, two space journalists, Michael Cabbage and William Harwood, released their book, &quot;Comm Check: The Final Flight of Shuttle Columbia&quot;. It discusses the history of the Space Shuttle program, and documents the post-disaster recovery and investigation efforts. Michael Leinbach, a retired Launch Director at KSC who was working on the day of the disaster, released &quot;Bringing Columbia Home: The Untold Story of a Lost Space Shuttle and Her Crew&quot; in 2018. It documents his personal experience during the disaster, and the debris and remains recovery efforts.

In 2004, the documentary &quot;&quot; was released; it told of the life of Ilan Ramon and focused on the issues in NASA management that led to the disaster. PBS released a Nova documentary, &quot;Space Shuttle Disaster&quot;, in 2008. It featured commentary from NASA officials and space experts, and discussed historical issues with the spacecraft and NASA.

The Scottish Celtic-Rock band Runrig included a song titled &quot;Somewhere&quot; on their album &quot;The Story&quot; that ends with a recording of a radio communication from Laurel Clark. Clark, who had become a fan of the band when she lived in Scotland, had a Runrig song &quot;Running to the Light&quot; play as her wakeup music on January 27; her CD of &quot;The Stamping Ground&quot; was recovered in the debris and presented to the band by Clark&#x27;s husband and son.

<text>STS-1 (Space Transportation System-1) was the first orbital spaceflight of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program. The first orbiter, &quot;Columbia&quot;, launched on April 12, 1981, and returned on April 14, 1981, 54.5 hours later, having orbited the Earth 37 times. &quot;Columbia&quot; carried a crew of two—commander John W. Young and pilot Robert L. Crippen. It was the first American crewed space flight since the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) in 1975. STS-1 was also the maiden test flight of a new American spacecraft to carry a crew, though it was preceded by atmospheric testing (ALT) of the orbiter and ground testing of the Space Shuttle system.

The launch occurred on the 20th anniversary of Vostok 1, the first human spaceflight, performed by Yuri Gagarin for the USSR. This was a coincidence rather than a celebration of the anniversary; a technical problem had prevented STS-1 from launching two days earlier, as was planned.

== Crew ==
Commander John Young and pilot Robert Crippen were selected as the STS-1 crew in early 1978. Young stated that as the Chief of the Astronaut Office he recommended himself to command the mission. Young, with four previous missions, was the most experienced astronaut in NASA at the time and was also the only member of NASA Astronaut Group 2 still in service. He flew twice on Project Gemini and twice on the Apollo program, walked on the Moon in 1972 as the Commander of Apollo 16, and became Chief of the Astronaut Office in 1974. Crippen, part of NASA Astronaut Group 7 after the cancellation of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), was a rookie and would become the first of his astronaut group to fly in space. Prior to his selection on STS-1, Crippen participated in the Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT) and also served as a capsule communicator (capcom) for all three Skylab missions and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP).

&quot;Columbia&quot; carried Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) for both Young and Crippen in the event of an emergency spacewalk. If such an event occurred, Crippen would go outside the orbiter, with Young standing by in case Crippen required assistance.

 Young and Crippen trained the longest for a space mission before flying in NASA history. If STS-1 had launched in March 1979 as originally scheduled &quot;We&#x27;d have been launched about halftrained&quot;, Young said. As no one had flown the shuttle before, they helped design the craft&#x27;s controls, including 2,214 switches and displays in the cockpit — about three times as many on the Apollo command module — and many contingency procedures. STS-1 carried 22 manuals, each three inches thick and together weighing ; the procedure for an electronics failure from a cooling system malfunction had 255 steps.

== Suborbital mission plan ==
During the original planning stages for the early Space Shuttle missions, NASA management under the Carter Administration felt a need to undertake initial tests of the system prior to the first orbital flight. To that end, Vice President Walter F. Mondale as chairman of the National Space Council suggested a suborbital flight landing at the emergency landing site at Dakar, Senegal. NASA further suggested that STS-1, instead of being an orbital flight, be used to test the Return To Launch Site (RTLS) abort scenario. This involved an abort being called in the first few moments after launch, and using its main engines, once the SRBs had been jettisoned, to power it back to the launch site. This scenario, while potentially necessary in the event of an early abort being called, was seen as being extremely dangerous. Young overruled both proposals, and STS-1 went ahead as the first orbital mission. The NASA managers were swayed by Young questioning the need for the test, and the weight of his opinion was especially strong as he was someone who not only had been to the Moon twice, but had walked on it. He would fly the Space Shuttle again on the STS-9 mission, a ten-day flight in 1983.

== Mission summary ==
The first launch of the Space Shuttle occurred on April 12, 1981, exactly 20years after the first crewed space flight, when the orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot; lifted off from Pad A, Launch Complex 39, at the Kennedy Space Center. The launch took place at 12:00:04UTC. A launch attempt two days earlier was scrubbed because &quot;Columbia&quot;″s four primary general purpose IBM System/4 Pi computers (GPCs) failed to provide correct timing to the backup flight system (BFS) when the GPCs were scheduled to transition from vehicle checkout to flight configuration mode.

Not only was this the first launch of the Space Shuttle, but it marked the first time that solid-fuel rockets were used for a NASA crewed launch (although previous systems had used solid-fuel motors for their escape towers or retro rockets). STS-1 was also the first U.S. crewed space vehicle launched without an uncrewed powered test flight. The STS-1 orbiter, &quot;Columbia&quot;, also holds the record for the amount of time spent in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) before launch – 610 days, the time needed for the replacement of many of its heat shield tiles.

The NASA mission objective for the maiden flight was to accomplish a safe ascent into orbit and return to Earth for a safe landing of Orbiter and crew. The only payload carried on the mission was a Development Flight Instrumentation (DFI) package, which contained sensors and measuring devices to record the orbiter&#x27;s performance and the stresses that occurred during launch, ascent, orbital flight, descent and landing. All 113 flight test objectives were accomplished, and the orbiter&#x27;s spaceworthiness was verified.

During the final T−9minute holding period, Launch Director George Page read a message of good wishes to the crew from President Ronald Reagan, ending with, &quot;John, we can&#x27;t do more from the launch team than say, we wish you an awful lot of luck. We are with you one thousand percent and we are awful proud to have been a part of it. Good luck gentlemen.&quot;

Ignition of the three RS-25 main engines was sensed as a sharp increase in noise. The stack rocked &quot;downwards&quot; (towards the crew&#x27;s feet), then back up to the vertical, at which point both Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) ignited. Crippen likened lift-off to a &quot;steam catapult shot&quot; (such as when an aircraft is launched from an aircraft carrier). The stack&#x27;s combined northwards translation and climb above the launch tower&#x27;s lightning rod were readily apparent to Young. After clearing the tower the stack began a right roll (until the +Z axis or vertical fin pointed) to a launch azimuth of 067° True (in order to achieve an orbital inclination of 40.30°), and pitched to a &quot;heads down&quot; attitude (to reduce loading on the wings). Simultaneously control was passed from the launch team in Florida to Flight Director Neil Hutchinson&#x27;s Silver team in Flight Control Room 1 (FCR 1) in Texas with astronaut Dan Brandenstein as their CAPCOM.

&quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s main engines were throttled down to 65% thrust to transit the region of Max Q, the point during ascent when the shuttle undergoes maximum aerodynamic stress. This occurred 56 seconds into the flight at Mach1.06. The wind corrected value was (predicted , limit ). The two SRBs performed better than expected causing a lofted trajectory, and were jettisoned after burnout at 2 minutes and 12 seconds (at altitude, higher than planned). After 8 minutes and 34 seconds Mission Elapsed Time (MET), the main engines were shut down (MECO, at altitude ) and the external tank was jettisoned 18 seconds later to eventually break up and impact in the Indian Ocean. Two twin-engined Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engine burns of 86 seconds duration initiated at 10 minutes and 34 seconds MET and 75 seconds duration at 44 minutes 2 seconds MET inserted &quot;Columbia&quot; into a orbit. This subtle deviation from the original plan of circular went largely unnoticed. In fact, it adjusted the spacecraft&#x27;s orbital period to take account of the April 10, 1981, scrub, so that attempts could still be made to use KH-11 reconnaissance satellites to image &quot;Columbia&quot; on orbit. Overall Young commented that there was a lot less vibration and noise during launch than they had expected. However, the sensations accompanying the first firing of the large Reaction Control System (RCS) jets surprised the crew. Crippen commented &quot;it&#x27;s like a big cannon just fired ... you don&#x27;t like them the first time you hear them&quot;. Young reported that &quot;the entire cabin vibrates ... it felt like the nose was being bent&quot;.

Once on-orbit both crew members safed their ejection seats and unstrapped. The next critical event was payload bay door opening. This was essential to allow heat rejection from &quot;Columbia&quot;″s systems via the doors&#x27; space radiators. Failure to open these by the end of the second orbit would have resulted in a return to Earth at the end of the fifth orbit, before the limited capacity of the flash evaporator cooling system was exceeded. As they opened the doors the crew noticed that they had sustained damage to thermal protection system (TPS) tiles on the OMS pods. This was televised to the ground. Shortly afterwards Young, then Crippen doffed their emergency ejection suits.

The majority of the crew&#x27;s approximately 53hours in low Earth orbit was spent conducting systems tests. Despite the scheduling impact of efforts to image &quot;Columbia&quot;″s TPS by utilizing external assets, these were all accomplished. They included: Crew Optical Alignment Sight (COAS) calibration, star tracker performance, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) performance, manual and automatic RCS testing, radiation measurement, propellant crossfeeding, hydraulics functioning, fuel cell purging, and photography. The OMS-3 and OMS-4 burns at 006:20:46 and 007:05:32 MET respectively raised this orbit to (compared to a planned circular). These two firings were single engined utilizing the crossfeed system. The crew reported a cold first night on board despite acceptable temperature indications. They found the second night comfortable after settings were adjusted.

During the second day of the mission, the astronauts received a phone call from Vice President George H. W. Bush. President Ronald Reagan had originally intended to visit the Mission Control Center during the mission, but at the time was still recovering from an assassination attempt which had taken place two weeks before the launch (Reagan had only returned home to the White House the day prior to the launch).

The crew awoke from their second sleep period earlier than planned. Preparations for return to Earth began with breakfast. Stowing of cabin items, flight control system checkout, data processing system reconfigurations, and then ejection suit donning followed. In Houston, the Crimson team headed by their Flight Director Don Puddy came on duty in FCR1 for the mission&#x27;s final shift. His CAPCOM was astronaut Joseph P. Allen with Frederick Hauck assisting. Payload bay door closing was a critical milestone to ensure vehicle structural and thermal integrity for re-entry. If power closing had failed, Crippen was trained to conduct a one-man extravehicular activity (EVA) to manually winch them closed. With cabin switch positions verified, the crew strapped into their ejection seats. Meanwhile, Johnson Space Center (JSC) pilots Charlie Hayes and Ted Mendenhall were airborne over California&#x27;s Edwards Air Force Base area in a Shuttle Training Aircraft (STA) performing a final check of landing weather conditions.

Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) 2 and 3 were started (to provide flight control hydraulic pressure). The 160-second twin-engine OMS de-orbit burn took place during the 36th orbit over the southern Indian Ocean and changed the orbital parameters from to . This ensured atmospheric capture of the spacecraft close enough to the planned landing site to have sufficient energy for a controlled glide landing, but not so close that energy would have to be dissipated at a rate exceeding its structural capability. Young then slowly pitched &quot;Columbia&quot; up to the wings level nose high entry attitude. Both crew members armed their ejection seats during this pitch around. Nearly half an hour later APU 1 was started as planned. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Columbia&quot; entered an approximately 21-minute long communications blackout. This was due to a combination of ionization (16 minutes) and lack of ground station coverage between Guam and Buckhorn Tracking Station at Dryden Flight Research Facility. Entry Interface (EI) was reached over the eastern Pacific Ocean from the landing site at a speed of around . EI is merely an arbitrarily defined geodetic altitude of employed by NASA for the purposes of trajectory computations and mission planning. Above this altitude, the spacecraft is considered to be outside the &quot;sensable atmosphere&quot;.

Most of this first orbiter entry was flown automatically. An initial angle of attack of 40° had to be maintained until through the most severe aerodynamic heating after which it was gradually reduced. At about altitude a light pink air glow caused by entry heating became visible, and both crew members lowered their visors. &quot;Columbia&quot; had to maneuver &quot;cross range&quot; of its orbital ground track to reach the planned landing site during the entry. Consequently, a roll into a right bank was flown when the air density had increased sufficiently to raise dynamic pressure to (with speed still in excess of Mach 24 and approximately altitude). Automatic roll reversals to control energy dissipation rate and cross range steering were performed at around Mach 18.5 and Mach 9.8. The crew clearly observed the coast of California as &quot;Columbia&quot; crossed it near Big Sur at Mach 7 and . Both the Mach 4.8 and Mach 2.8 roll reversals were automatically initiated and manually completed by John Young. The last RCS jet firing took place at an altitude of — lower than desired (due to a predicted risk of combustion chamber explosion).

Young again took manual control for the remainder of the flight as they went subsonic approaching the Heading Alignment Circle (HAC). A wide left turn was flown to line up with lake bed runway23, whilst T-38 &quot;Chase1&quot;, crewed by astronauts Jon McBride and &quot;Pinky&quot; Nelson joined formation. Main gear touch down occurred on runway23 at Edwards Air Force Base, at equivalent airspeed, slightly slower and around further down the runway than planned. This was the result of a combination of better than predicted Orbiter lift-to-drag ratios and tail wind. Touch down time was 18:21UTC on April 14, 1981. As they rolled to a stop, Young remarked over the radio, &quot;This is the world&#x27;s greatest all electric flying machine. I&#x27;ll tell you that. That was super!&quot;

&quot;Columbia&quot; was returned to Kennedy Space Center from California on April 28, 1981, atop the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. The 36-orbit, flight lasted 2days, 6hours, 20minutes and 53seconds.

=== Mission anomalies ===

STS-1 was the first orbital test flight of what NASA claims was, at the time, the most complex flying machine ever built. Roughly 70 anomalies were observed during and after the flight, owing to the many components and systems that could not otherwise be adequately tested. These included:

* Similar to the first Saturn V launch in 1967, engineers underestimated the amount of noise and vibration produced by the Space Shuttle. Shock waves from the SRB thrust were deflected up into the orbiter&#x27;s tail section, which flexed the wing flaps and bent several fuel tank supports; Columbia could have had trouble landing if the flaps had been damaged. An improved sound suppression system was later installed in LC-39A to damp vibrations.
* Pilot Crippen reported that, throughout the first stage of the launch up to SRB separation, he saw &quot;white stuff&quot; coming off the External Tank and splattering the windows, which was probably the white paint covering the External Tank&#x27;s thermal foam.
* The astronauts&#x27; on-orbit visual inspection showed significant damage to the thermal protection tiles on the OMS/RCS pods at the orbiter&#x27;s aft end, and John Young reported that two tiles on the nose looked like someone had taken &quot;big bites out of them&quot;. The U.S. Air Force also photographed the orbiter&#x27;s tiles using a secret KH-11 KENNEN reconnaissance satellite controlled by Blue Cube. Only the prime and backup crews and a few other NASA employees were aware of this. Young and Crippen were instructed to perform maneuvers to align &quot;Columbia&quot; so that the KH-11 could photograph it; because of the preplanned required trajectory, the launch window was far narrower than the publicized six hours. Images obtained confirmed that damage to &quot;Columbia&quot; was not serious. Post-flight inspection of &quot;Columbia&quot; confirmed that approximately 16 undensified tiles near the OMS pod had been lost during ascent.
* &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s aerodynamics at high Mach numbers during reentry were found to differ significantly in some respects from those estimated in pre-flight testing. A misprediction of the location of the center of pressure (due to using an ideal gas model instead of a real gas model) caused the computer to have to extend the body flap by sixteen degrees rather than the expected eight or nine. The first roll maneuver resulted in lateral and directional oscillations during which side slip angles of up to 4° were reached, twice as high as predicted. Analysis attributed the cause to unexpectedly large rolling moments due to yaw RCS jet firings. During the early stages of entry, orbiter roll control is achieved as a result of sideslip modulation.
* The orbiter&#x27;s heat shield was damaged when an overpressure wave from the solid rocket booster caused a forward RCS oxidizer strut to fail.
* The same overpressure wave also forced the orbiter body flap – an extension on the orbiter&#x27;s underbelly that helps to control pitch during reentry – into an angle well beyond the point where cracking or rupture of its hydraulic system would have been expected. Such damage would have made a controlled descent impossible, with John Young later admitting that had the crew known about this, they would have flown the shuttle up to a safe altitude and ejected, causing &quot;Columbia&quot; to be lost on the first flight. Young had reservations about ejection as a safe abort mode due to the fact that the SRBs were firing throughout the ejection window, but he justified taking this risk because, in his view, an inoperative body flap would have made landing and descent &quot;extremely difficult if not impossible.&quot;
* The strike plate next to the forward latch of &quot;Columbia&quot;″s external tank door was melted and distorted due to excess heat exposure during reentry. This heat was attributed to an improperly installed tile adjacent to the plate.
* During remarks at a 2003 gathering, John Young stated that a protruding tile gap filler ducted hot gas into the right main landing gear well, which caused significant damage, including the buckling of the landing gear door. He said that neither he nor Crippen were told about this incident and he was not aware that it had happened until reading the postflight mission report for STS-1, also adding that the gas leak was noted in the report, but not the buckling of the landing door. (The buckling of the door is in fact in the anomaly report, anomaly STS-1-V-49).

Despite these problems, the STS-1 mission was completed successfully, and in most respects &quot;Columbia&quot; performed optimally. After some modifications to the Shuttle and to the launch and reentry procedures, &quot;Columbia&quot; flew the next four Shuttle missions.

== Mission insignia ==
The artwork for the official mission insignia was designed by artist Robert McCall. It is a symbolic representation of the Space Shuttle. The image does not depict the black wing roots present on the actual Shuttle.

== Anniversary ==
The ultimate launch date of STS-1 fell on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s Vostok 1, the first spaceflight to carry a human crew. In 2001, Yuri&#x27;s Night was established to celebrate both events. In a tribute to the 25th anniversary of the first flight of Space Shuttle, Firing Room 1 in the Launch Control Center at Kennedy Space Center – which launched STS-1 – was renamed the Young-Crippen Firing Room. NASA described the mission as &quot;the boldest test flight in history&quot;.

STS-1 and STS-2 were the only two shuttle flights to have the External Tank painted white. To reduce the Shuttle&#x27;s overall weight, all flights from STS-3 onward used an unpainted tank. The use of an unpainted tank provided a weight saving of approximately , and gave the External Tank the distinctive orange color which later became associated with the Space Shuttle.

== In popular culture ==
The song &quot;Countdown&quot; by Rush, from the 1982 album &quot;Signals&quot;, was written about STS-1 and the inaugural flight of &quot;Columbia&quot;. The song was &quot;dedicated with thanks to astronauts Young and Crippen and all the people of NASA for their inspiration and cooperation&quot;.

The footage of the launch was commonly played on MTV throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and was the first thing shown on the channel, along with footage of Neil Armstrong on the Moon and the launch of Apollo 11.

IMAX cameras filmed the launch, landing, and mission control during the flight, for a documentary film entitled &quot;Hail Columbia&quot;, which debuted in 1982 and later became available on DVD. The title of the film comes from the pre-1930s unofficial American national anthem, &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot;.

The beginning of the song &quot;Hello Earth&quot;, on Kate Bush&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; album, contains a short clip of dialogue between &quot;Columbia&quot; and Mission Control, during the last few minutes of its descent, beginning with &quot;Columbia now at nine times the speed of sound...&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Collateral Damage,&quot; the 12th episode of the ninth season of the long-running Canadian-American military science fiction television show &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, a childhood flashback shows that the character Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell witnessed the launch with his father live on television at the age of ten, one of the events that led to him becoming a United States Air Force pilot.

== Wake-up calls ==
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Project Gemini, and first used music to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. A special musical track is chosen for each day in space, often by the astronauts&#x27; families, to have a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or in reference to the day&#x27;s planned activities.

== Pad fatalities ==
An accident occurred on March 19, 1981, that led to the deaths of three people. During a countdown test for STS-1, a pure nitrogen atmosphere was introduced in the aft engine compartment of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; to reduce the danger of an explosion from the many other potentially dangerous gases on board the orbiter. At the conclusion of the test, pad workers were given clearance to return to work on the orbiter, even though the nitrogen had not yet been purged due to a recent procedural change. Three technicians, John Bjornstad, Forrest Cole, and Nick Mullon, entered the compartment without air packs, unaware of the danger since nitrogen gas is odorless and colorless, and lost consciousnesses due to lack of oxygen. Several minutes later, another worker saw them and tried to help, but passed out himself. The fourth did not alert anyone, but was himself seen by two other people. Of those two, one alerted a security guard and another went to help the unconscious group. The security guard entered the compartment with an air pack and removed the five men from the compartment.

Security procedures delayed ambulances from arriving on the scene by several minutes. Bjornstad died at the scene; Cole died on April 1 without ever regaining consciousness, and Mullon suffered permanent brain damage and died on April 11, 1995, from complications of his injuries. These were the first launchpad deaths at Cape Canaveral since the Apollo 1 fire, which killed three astronauts during preparations for the crewed Moon landing missions.

The incident did not delay the launch of STS-1 less than a month later, but pilot Robert Crippen gave an on-orbit tribute to Bjornstad and Cole. A three-month inquiry determined a combination of a recent change in safety procedures and a miscommunication during the operations were the cause of the accident. A report called &quot;LC-39A Mishap Investigation Board Final Report&quot; was released with the findings. The names of John Bjornstad, Forrest Cole and Nicholas Mullon are engraved on a monument at the US Space Walk of Fame in Florida.

<doc id="177546" wikidata="Q24637" url="?curid=177546" title="Guerrilla marketing">
<text>Guerrilla marketing is an advertisement strategy in which a company uses surprise and/or unconventional interactions in order to promote a product or service. It is a type of publicity. The term was popularized by Jay Conrad Levinson&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;Guerrilla Marketing&quot;.

Guerrilla marketing uses multiple techniques and practices to establish direct contact with potential customers. One of the goals of this interaction is to cause an emotional reaction in the clients, and the ultimate goal of marketing is to induce people to remember products or brands in a different way than they might have been accustomed to.

As traditional advertising media channelssuch as print, radio, television, and direct maillose popularity, marketers and advertisers have felt compelled to find new strategies to convey their commercial messages to the consumer. Guerrilla marketing focuses on taking the consumer by surprise to make a dramatic impression about the product or brand. This in turn creates buzz about the product being marketed. It is a way of advertising that increases consumers&#x27; engagement with the product or service, and is designed to create a memorable experience. By creating a memorable experience, it also increases the likelihood that a consumer, or someone who interacted with the campaign, will tell their friends about the product. Thus, via word of mouth, the product or service being advertised reaches more people than initially anticipated.

Guerrilla marketing is relatively inexpensive, and focuses more on reach rather than frequency. For guerrilla campaigns to be successful, companies generally do not need to spend large amounts of money, but they need to have imagination, energy and time. Therefore, guerrilla marketing has the potential to be effective for small businesses, especially if they are competing against bigger companies.

The message to consumers is often designed to be clear and concise. This type of marketing also works on the unconscious mind, because purchasing decisions are often made by the unconscious mind. To keep the product or service in the unconscious mind requires repetition, so if a buzz is created around a product, and if it is shared amongst friends, then this mechanism enables repetition.

==Etymology and origin==
The term &quot;guerrilla marketing&quot; is traced to guerrilla warfare, which employs atypical tactics to achieve an objective. In 1984, the term guerrilla marketing was introduced by Leo Burnett&#x27;s creative director Jay Conrad Levinson in his book &quot;Guerrilla Marketing&quot;. The term itself was from the inspiration of guerrilla warfare which was unconventional warfare using different techniques from usual and small tactic strategies used by armed civilians. Because the key goal is to manipulate consumers into talking about the product or brand via social media platforms, significant imagination and energy is required in order to capture the attention of sufficient numbers of people. This is especially the case when one considers that, with other firms competing for people&#x27;s attention, there can be significant &quot;clutter&quot; in the environment that the consumer is forced to deal with daily.
Guerrilla marketing is popular for small or medium-sized businesses who have tight budgets. But the same tactics have also been used by large companies trying to differentiate themselves from competitors via social media campaigns. Similar marketing tactics have also been used by individuals seeking employment. 
Guerrilla marketing has also evolved to include street marketing, which itself has evolved to encompass activities beyond the everyday realm of urban streets and thus now includes newer promotional methodologies. Examples include mass-printed flyers and animated digital signage.

Ambient communication is advertising presented on elements of the environment, including nearly every available physical surface. It is a compilation of intelligence, flexibility, and effective use of the atmosphere. These kinds of ads can be found anywhere and everywhere from hand dryers in public bathrooms and petrol pumps through to bus hand straps and golf-hole cups.

===Ambush marketing===

Ambush marketing is a form of associative marketing, used by an organization to capitalize upon the awareness, attention, goodwill, and other benefits, generated by having an association with an event or property, without that organization having an official or direct connection to that event or property.
This form of marketing is typically seen at major events where rivals of official sponsors attempt to build an association with the event and increase awareness for their brands, sometimes covertly. For example, during the 2012 London Olympics, footwear maker Nike created &#x27;find your Greatness&#x27; spots where they featured athletes from several locations called London (but without showing the real London or referring to the Olympic games). This was intended to build a strong association between the London Olympics and Nike.

===Stealth marketing===
Stealth marketing is a type of advertising in which a product or service is promoted in a way that is intended to draw attention without appearing to be promotional.

===Viral marketing===

Viral marketing describes any strategy that encourages individuals to pass on a marketing message to others (often via online social-media platforms), creating the potential for exponential growth in the message&#x27;s exposure and influence. Like viruses, such strategies take advantage of rapid multiplication to explode the message to thousands, to millions. Off the Internet, viral marketing has been referred to as &quot;word-of-mouth&quot;, &quot;creating a buzz&quot;, &quot;leveraging the media&quot;, &quot;network marketing&quot;, But on the Internet, for better or worse, it&#x27;s called &quot;viral marketing&quot;.

===Buzz marketing===

Similar to viral marketing, buzz marketing uses high-profile media to encourage the public to discuss the brand or product. Buzz marketing works best when consumer&#x27;s responses to a product or service and subsequent endorsements are genuine, without the company paying them. Buzz generated from buzz marketing campaigns is referred to as &quot;amplified WOM&quot; (word-of-mouth), and &quot;organic WOM&quot; is when buzz occurs naturally by the consumer.

===Grassroots marketing===

Grassroots campaigns aim to win customers over individually. A successful grassroots campaign is not about the dissemination of the marketing message in the hope that possible consumers are paying attention, but rather highlights a personal connection between the consumer and the brand, and builds a lasting relationship with the brand.

===Astroturfing===

Astroturfing is among the most controversial guerrilla marketing strategies, and it has a high risk of backfiring for the company marketing the product or service. Astroturfing derives from artificial “turf”, often used in stadiums or tennis courts – also known as fake grass. Hence, fake endorsements, testimonials and recommendations are all products of Astroturfing in the public-relations sector. Astroturfing involves generating an artificial hype around a particular product or company through a review or discussion on online blogs or forums by an individual who is paid to convey a positive view yet who does not reveal their true motivation. This can have a negative and detrimental effect on a company, should the consumer suspect that the review or opinion is inauthentic and manipulative of public opinion. The result is damage to the company&#x27;s reputation, and possibly litigation.

===Street marketing===
Street marketing uses unconventional means of advertising or promoting products and brands in public areas. The main goal is to encourage consumers to remember and recall the brand or product marketed. As a division of guerrilla marketing, street marketing is specific to all marketing activities carried out in streets and public areas such as parks, streets, and events. Street marketing also encompasses advertising outdoors, such as on shopping trolleys (shopping carts, in the US), public toilets, sides of cars or public transport, manhole covers, footpaths, rubbish bins, etc.

Street marketing is not confined to fixed print-form advertisements. It is common practice for organizations to use brand ambassadors who distribute product samples or discount vouchers, and answer queries about the product while emphasizing the brand. The brand ambassadors may be accompanied by a kiosk containing product samples or demonstration materials, or wearing a &quot;walking billboard&quot;. The physical interaction with consumers has a greater influencing power than traditional passive advertising.

Street marketing is understood as mobilizing not only the space of the streets but also the imagination of the street: that of street culture and street art. Young urbanites are often put forth as the most susceptible target for these campaigns due to their associations with the culture of the street.

According to Marcel Saucet and Bernard Cova, street marketing can be used as a general term encompassing six principal types of activities:
* Distribution of flyers or products, this activity is more traditional, and is the most common form of street marketing employed by brands.
* Product animations, this consists of personalizing a high-traffic space using brand imagery. The idea is to create a micro-universe in order to promote a new product or service.
* Human animations, the goal of such actions is to create a space in which the brand&#x27;s message is communicated through human activity.
* Road shows, this form of mobile presentation is based on the development of means of transport: taxi, bike, Segway, etc.
* Uncovered actions, these activities involve the customization of street elements.
* Event actions, these activities take the form of spectacles, such as flash mobs or contests. The idea is to promote a product, service, or brand value through organization of a public event.

==Typical procedure==
First, corporations identify the public places where the campaign can be developed such as beaches, cultural events, close to schools, sporting events and recreation areas for children. Next, companies have to develop a plan to get close to different media and the target market. In order to attract attention, street marketing events not only involve unusual activities, but use technology as part of the events. The purpose is to increase the value of the campaigns and get potential consumers&#x27; attention.

Companies develop plans taking into account that the global communication and interaction involved in guerrilla or street marketing is not limited to customers or the media. They are also developed to identify opportunities and collect enough information about products, markets and competitors. For businesses, it is important that customers stay with them, instead of choosing the competitors’ offers. They implement innovative strategies with which they will not lose position in the market, and they consider supplementation with other advertisement through other mediums, such as radio and television, when using street marketing.

Various strategies are used in guerrilla marketing. One strategy involves providing offers to increase sales. In many cases, businesses do not only supply their products or services to be recognized, but they also offer other things for free. Another instance is to present a fundraiser offer. The point of this strategy is to help other organizations, such as schools, by offering them money. Most companies implement this method not only to increase their sales, but to improve their reputation and image among the community. Finally, there is a strategy called &quot;team selling&quot; that consists of forming groups of people, the majority of them young, who go knocking on doors of different houses in a neighborhood. They do this in order to help companies with promoting and selling their products or services.

When doing guerrilla marketing or street marketing, organizations also consider focusing on the psychological approach. For many companies, this implies if they are having success or not. Street marketing focuses on some psychological aspects to know customers&#x27; behavior and preferences. For example, certain psychological areas study how people&#x27;s brains are divided: 45% of people are left-brained, 45% are right brained, and 10% are balanced. Left-brained persons tend to be logical, right-brained ones tend to be emotional, and the rest are a combination the two. Then, according to the product or service that enterprises provide, and also the kind of customer, businesses decides the way they are going to manage their street marketing campaigns. Besides, almost all the enterprises base their street marketing campaigns on repeating the messages they spread among their customers. Repetition is related to the unconscious part of the mind. This is the one in charge of making decisions. It lets people know what they are going to choose, as well as what they are going to buy. Businesses follow the principle that establishes that, the more people paying attention to the campaign, the more possibilities that campaign has for being remembered.

When a company decides to do a guerrilla marketing campaign which could be anything out of viral, ambient, ambush, street or stealth, the focus for them is to meet the objectives. The main objectives for them are:
* To create enough buzz to serve in word-of-mouth, helping the brand to establish well with its products
* To touch most of the five sensory identities of the customer/consumer, enhancing personal experience with the brand and building a good reputation
* To reach the target successfully by taking the brand to them in their daily routine
Through the experience and the ephemeral feelings shared between the company and the target, advertisers and agencies generate a feeling of intimacy that resonates beyond the encounter. This feeling of nearness becomes all the more lasting as the affected individuals relive this encounter on the internet through social media.

==Strategy==
The guerrilla marketing promotion strategy was first identified by Jay Conrad Levinson in his book &quot;Guerrilla Marketing&quot; (1984). The book describes hundreds of &quot;guerrilla marketing weapons&quot; in use at the time. Guerrilla marketers need to be creative in devising unconventional methods of promotion to maintain the public&#x27;s interest in a product or service. Levinson writes that when implementing guerrilla marketing tactics, smaller organizations and entrepreneurs are actually at an advantage. Ultimately, however, guerrilla marketers must &quot;deliver the goods&quot;. In &quot;The Guerrilla Marketing Handbook&quot;, the authors write: &quot;...in order to sell a product or a service, a company must establish a relationship with the customer. It must build trust and support the customer&#x27;s needs, and it must provide a product that delivers the promised benefits...&quot;

==Online guerrilla marketing==
The web is rife with examples of guerrilla marketing, to the extent that many people don&#x27;t notice its presence - until a particularly successful campaign arises. The desire for instant gratification of internet users provides an avenue for guerrilla marketing by allowing businesses to combine wait marketing with guerrilla tactics. Simple examples consist of using &#x27;loading&#x27; pages or image alt texts to display an entertaining or informative message to users waiting to access the content they were trying to get to. As users dislike waiting with no occupation on the web, it is essential, and easy, to capture their attention this way. Other website methods include interesting web features such as engaging landing pages.

Many online marketing strategies also use social media such as Facebook and LinkedIn to begin campaigns, share-able features and event host events. Other companies run competitions or discounts based on encouraging users to share or create content related to their product. Viral videos are an incredibly popular form of guerrilla marketing in which companies film entertaining or surprising videos that internet users are likely to share and enjoy, that subtly advertise their service or product. Some companies such as Google even create interactive elements like the themed Google logo games to spark interest and engagement. These dynamic guerrilla marketing tactics can become news globally and give businesses considerable publicity.

==Examples==
There are various organizations that have implemented guerrilla and street marketing strategies. The majority of them are small companies, but there are also big companies that have been involved in the guerrilla and street marketing environment. Most of the examples of the strategies that both small and big enterprises have put into action include costumed persons, the distribution of tickets, and people providing samples, among others.
As stated before, one guerrilla marketing conventional method that is used by many businesses is to provide fliers. The goal is to create awareness to customers about what the enterprise is doing. One example of this took place in Montpelier, Vermont, where the New England Culinary Institute (NECI) sent a group of students to a movie theatre to hand out 400 fliers. The fliers had coupons in which NECI was inviting people to go to its monthly Theme Dinners. Another company, Boston&#x27;s Kung-Fu Tai Chi Club, chose the option of disseminating fliers instead of placing its advertisements in newspapers. The purpose of the fliers was to promote the company&#x27;s self-defence classes for women.

Other businesses apply the technique of sending disguised people to promote things on the streets. For example, Match.com organized a street marketing activity in the “Feria del Libro” (“Book Fair”) in Madrid. It consisted of a man dressed like a prince who was walking among the crowd looking for his “real love”. He had a glass slipper and even got to try the shoe on some people. A woman behind him was giving bookmarks to the people which contained messages such as “Times have changed; the way to find love, too” or “You have been reading love stories all your life; experience yours on Match.com”. Also, in Madrid and Barcelona, Nokia developed a campaign called “Avestruz” (“Ostrich”) to promote the 5500 and 5700 mobiles. In the campaign, a group of real-size ostrich puppets tried to interact with young people in order to let them know these mobiles provide a high-quality MP3 playback. The puppets were holding their own telephones and listening to the music. When a young person appeared, the puppet tried to catch his/her attention to show him/her the quality of the mobile. The reason why Nokia decided to use ostriches was that they are big animals, so people could easily look at them.

There are enterprises that disseminate passes or tickets to different events. For example, Sony invests on joining promoters and tells them that they have to infiltrate in public meetings. What they have to do is to distribute free tickets to concerts and other musical events sponsored by the company. Another instance is the Spanish company Clickair (an extension of Iberia Airlines), that developed a campaign in which a group of five people had to walk through Barcelona streets dressed as Euros. The group was supplying approximately 3,000 tickets to promote different Clickair destinations. The people who first sent a text message with the required information would get free tickets to go on a trip. In the end, the company received a total of 3,390 messages.

Along with these examples, there are other street-marketing techniques that are even more unusual. Lee Jeans, a French company dedicated to the selling of jeans, promoted the opening of their new store in rue des Rosiers in Paris. The method they applied consisted of distributing denims, as well as denim accessories, on the different streets of the neighborhood. Furthermore, in Italy, the members of the company Nintendo put into action a campaign in which they used post-its to promote the Wii console. They pasted several post-its with the shapes of some characters from different video games. Those images were placed as if they were billboards on the streets. “Wii not forget”, the name of the campaign, and a brief explanation of it, were the words written on the post-its.

In some cases, some street marketing may incite the ire of local authorities; such was the case in Houston, Texas, when BMW&#x27;s ad agency (Street Factory Media in Minneapolis) attached a replication, made from styrofoam, of a Mini-Cooper to the side of a downtown building. For the cost of a small city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising on the Houston Chronicle.

Sony Ericsson used an undercover campaign in 2002, spearheaded by Jonathan Maron, when they hired 60 actors in ten major cities and had them accost strangers and ask them: &quot;Would you mind taking my picture?&quot; The actor then handed the target a brand new picture phone while talking about how cool the new device was. In this way, an everyday activity was converted into a branding event.

Guerrilla marketing is not exclusive to small companies. For big companies it is a high risk, high reward strategy. When successful, it can capture additional market share, but if it fails it can damage the company&#x27;s brand image. One successful guerrilla marketing campaign is the Coca-Cola ‘Happiness Machine”. In January 2010, Coca-Cola, with the help of Definition 6, filmed a reaction video of a Coke vending machine dispensing ‘doses’ of happiness to unsuspecting students in St. John&#x27;s University. A seemingly normal vending machine surprised students by dispensing items that were more than they bargained for. The students received items ranging from extra Coke, pizza, flowers, to even a twelve-foot hero sub. “Coke’s goal to inspire consumers through small, surprise moments of happiness” said Paul Iannacchino Jr., Creative Director, Definition 6. With a budget of only $60,000, the video generated 500,000 views in the first week. It now has over 7 million views to date. The campaign was so popular that a 30-second edit of the footage was featured during American Idol&#x27;s 19th season. The Coca-Cola “Happiness Machine” also went on to receive the CLIO&#x27;s prestigious Gold Interactive Award at the 51st annual awards dinner held in New York City. After the campaign&#x27;s success, Coca-Cola decided to continue with the ‘Happiness’ theme and has released similar videos since then.

==Strategic risk==
Because of the nature of guerrilla marketing, the message and objective must be clearly defined in order to avoid being misunderstood. Misinterpretation by the targeted audience of the message intended to be promoted is a risk. Word-of-mouth advertising does not always remain sufficiently focused to present the intended message. The rumor-like spread of word-of-mouth marketing is uncontrollable once released, and can result in a misrepresentation of the message or confusion about a brand.

Another risk involves wrongly timed (or wrongly placed) events, which may actually be perceived to be against the interests of the consumer. For instance, in an ill-conceived promotion which took place on January 31, 2007, several magnetic circuit boards—each with an flashing LED cartoon figure—were attached to metal surfaces in and around Boston, Massachusetts to promote the animated series, &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;. The circuit boards were mistakenly taken for explosive devices. Several subway stations, bridges, and a portion of Interstate 93 were closed as police examined, removed, and (in some cases) destroyed the devices.

Some guerrilla marketing may incite the ire of local authorities. Then risks are assessed and may still be considered worthwhile. Such was the case in Houston, Texas, when BMW Auto&#x27;s ad agency, Street Factory Media, attached a replica of a Mini-Cooper (made of Styrofoam), to the side of a downtown building in January 2013. For the small cost of a city-issued fine, the company received front page advertising in the Houston Chronicle.
Another problem presents itself if marketers fail to properly execute an undercover campaign. They run considerable risk of backlash. An example of this can be found in Sony Entertainment&#x27;s on-line debacle with Zipatoni. The company attempted to promote Zipatoni through a stealth marketing campaign, which was quickly detected by the internet community, resulting in Sony immediately experiencing a backlash from video game enthusiasts.

Street art is thus a subversive activity, hijacking public places and inventing rather paradoxical forms of expression that reformulate ways of communicating, all of which inform street marketing practices. Thus marketing in the street, given that it is inspired by the work of such artists, brings with it constraints and statutory risks for which agencies and advertisers are generally not prepared. The main problem is that, by definition, street mobilization campaigns require the use of public space, and that use must be authorized by government authorities to be legal. This is just as true for simple operations like distributing flyers as it is for mobilizing products or people and, of course, for a disguised campaign.

The authorizations necessary to carry out such a campaign are often very difficult to obtain within the time allotted for bringing the plan to fruition. Numerous potential operations have failed to obtain authorization for safety reasons, and in certain urban areas it is even expressly forbidden to undertake a guerrilla marketing campaign. In such cases, many agencies and advertisers will simply go ahead with the operation, meaning that they choose to act without authorization. How is such a choice reached, and on what bases? How is it justified? What impact does this choice have on the performance and costs of the operation? What transformations does this choice bring to the agency–advertiser relationship? These are the main questions posed in the development of street marketing operations today.

== Inexpensive costs ==
In a declining economy, guerrilla marketing is an increasing solution to giving companies the comparative edge over others. During times when companies are downsizing and cutting costs, companies look to guerrilla marketing as a cheaper strategy than conventional marketing. Instead of investing money in the marketing process, guerrillas invest energy, time and creativity. If done successfully, companies will be able to reach conventional goals for profits and growth with a smaller marketing budget. One such example is the &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot;. A group of film students filmed an amateur horror movie. By setting up an internet campaign devoted to spreading rumors about the fictitious &#x27;Blair Witch&#x27;, it created a lot of interest for the film. With a budget of $50,000, the movie grossed $250 million worldwide.

According to Jay Levinson, guerrilla marketing emphasizes strongly on customer follow-up rather than ignoring customers after their purchase. Focusing on customer follow-up is a cheaper strategy because the cost of selling to a new customer is six times higher than selling to an existing customer. During a tough economy, it is important to focus on building relationships rather than sales, and aiming at individuals instead of groups. This promotes repeat sales, referrals and increased size of purchase. The use of telephone as a follow-up tool is helpful in improving customer relationships. Email is also another inexpensive tool for maintaining relationships. Emails can be used to direct people to the company website. The site can be then used to provide information and to advance sales.

<doc id="177551" wikidata="Q349070" url="?curid=177551" title="Charles Wesley">
<text>Charles Wesley (18 December 1707 – 29 March 1788) was an English Anglican cleric and a principal leader of the Methodist movement. Wesley was a prolific hymnwriter who wrote over 6,500 hymns during his lifetime. His works include &quot;And Can It Be&quot;, &quot;O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing&quot;, &quot;Christ the Lord Is Risen Today&quot;, &quot;Love Divine, All Loves Excelling&quot;, &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; the carol , and &quot;Lo! He Comes With Clouds Descending&quot;.

Wesley was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire, the son of Anglican cleric and poet Samuel Wesley and his wife Susanna. He was a younger brother of Methodist founder John Wesley and Anglican cleric Samuel Wesley the Younger. He was the father of musician Samuel Wesley and the grandfather of musician Samuel Sebastian Wesley.

He was educated at Oxford University, where his brothers had also studied, and he formed the &quot;Holy Club&quot; among his fellow students in 1729. John Wesley later joined this group, as did George Whitefield. Charles followed his father and brother into ministry in 1735, and he travelled with John to Georgia in America, returning a year later. Following their evangelical conversions in 1738, the Wesley brothers travelled throughout Britain, converting followers to the Methodist revival through preaching and hymn singing. In 1749, he married Sarah Gwynne, the daughter of a Welsh gentleman who had been converted to Methodism by Howell Harris. From 1756 his ministry became more static and he ministered in Bristol, and later London.

Despite their closeness, Charles and John did not always agree on questions relating to their beliefs. In particular, Charles was strongly opposed to the idea of a breach with the Church of England in which they had been ordained.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Charles Wesley was the 18th child of Susanna Wesley and Samuel Wesley. He was born in Epworth, Lincolnshire, England, where his father was rector. In 1716, at the age of eight, he entered Westminster School, where his brother Samuel was usher. He was selected as King&#x27;s Scholar in 1721 and head boy in 1725–26, before matriculating at Christ Church, Oxford.

At Oxford, Wesley formed a prayer group among his fellow students in 1727; his elder brother, John, joined in 1729, soon becoming its leader and moulding it in line with his own convictions. They focused on studying the Bible and living a holy life. Other students mocked them, saying they were the &quot;Holy Club&quot;, &quot;Sacramentarians&quot;, and &quot;the Methodists&quot;, being methodical and exceptionally detailed in their Bible study, opinions and disciplined lifestyle. The Wesleys&#x27; future colleague, George Whitefield. joined the group. Wesley tutored while studying; he graduated in 1732 with a master&#x27;s degree in classical languages and literature. He followed his father and brothers into Anglican orders, being ordained as a priest in September 1735. That same year his father died.

On 14 October 1735, Wesley and his brother John sailed on &quot;The Simmonds&quot; from Gravesend, Kent, for Savannah in the Georgia colony of British America at the request of the governor, James Oglethorpe. Wesley was appointed Secretary of Indian Affairs and while John remained in Savannah, Wesley went as chaplain to the garrison and colony at nearby Fort Frederica, St. Simon&#x27;s Island, arriving there on 9 March 1736 according to his journal entry. Matters did not turn out well, and he was largely rejected by the settlers. In July 1736, Wesley was commissioned to England as the bearer of dispatches to the trustees of the colony. On 16 August 1736, he sailed from Charleston, South Carolina, never to return to the Georgia colony.

===Ministry===
In 1738 the Wesley brothers, both dejected following their unsuccessful mission, had religious experiences: Charles experienced an evangelical conversion (or &quot;renewal of faith&quot;) on 21 May and John had a similar experience in Aldersgate Street just three days later. A City of London blue plaque at 13 Little Britain, near the church of St Botolph, Aldersgate, off St. Martin&#x27;s Le Grand, marks the site of the former house of John Bray, reputed to be the scene of Wesley&#x27;s evangelical conversion. It reads, &quot;Adjoining this site stood the house of John Bray. Scene of Charles Wesley&#x27;s evangelical conversion, May 21st 1738&quot;. Wesley commemorated the first anniversary of his religious experience by composing an 18-stanza poem, with its seventh verse, beginning &quot;O for a thousand tongues to sing&quot;, now serving as the opening of a shorter hymn.

Wesley felt renewed strength to spread the gospel to ordinary people and it was around then that he began to write the poetic hymns for which he would become known. In January 1739, he was appointed as curate to serve at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Islington, but was forced to resign when the churchwardens objected to his evangelical preaching. Later that same year, finding that they were unwelcome inside parish churches, the Wesley brothers took to preaching to crowds in open fields. They were influenced by George Whitefield, whose open-air preaching was already reaching great numbers of Bristol colliers. Charles Wesley wrote to Whitefield regularly and is mentioned in many of Whitefield&#x27;s journal entries. Whitefield drew from many of Wesley&#x27;s hymns and even had one written to him by Wesley. From 1740, Charles and John were the joint leaders of the Methodist Revival and evangelised throughout Britain and Ireland. They were opposed by many Anglican clergy, especially when their appointed lay preachers began to preach in parishes without seeking permission. In Newcastle upon Tyne, Wesley established its first Methodist society. He faced mob violence in Wednesbury and Sheffield in 1743 and at Devizes in 1747.

Following a period of illness, after 1756 Wesley made no more journeys to distant parts of the country, mainly just moving between Bristol and London. Increasingly in his later years, Wesley became the mouthpiece of the so-called &quot;Church Methodists&quot;—he was strongly opposed to a separation of Methodism from its Anglican roots. In the 1780s, he was especially dismayed by his brother&#x27;s ordination of Methodist ministers to serve in America (&quot;see &quot;), which he criticised in a published poem.

===Marriage and children===

In April 1749, he married the much younger Sarah Gwynne (1726–1822), also known as Sally. She was the daughter of Marmaduke Gwynne, a wealthy Welsh magistrate who had been converted to Methodism by Howell Harris. They moved into a house at 4 Charles Street in Bristol in September 1749. Sarah accompanied the brothers on their journeys throughout Britain until at least 1753.

In 1771, Wesley obtained another house in London and moved into it that year with his elder son. By 1778 the whole family had transferred from Bristol to the London house, at 1 Great Chesterfield Street (now Wheatley Street), Marylebone, where they remained until Wesley&#x27;s death and on into the 19th century. The house in Bristol still stands and has been restored, however the London house was demolished in the mid 19th century.

Only three of the couple&#x27;s children survived infancy: Charles Wesley junior (1757–1834), Sarah Wesley (1759–1828), who like her mother was also known as Sally, and Samuel Wesley (1766–1837). Their other children, John, Martha Maria, Susannah, Selina and John James are all buried in Bristol, having died between 1753 and 1768. (See monument in garden on north side of junction of Lewis Mead and The Haymarket, Bristol.) Both Samuel and Charles junior were musical child prodigies and, like their father, became organists and composers. Charles junior spent most of his career as the personal organist of the Royal Family, and Samuel became one of the most accomplished musicians in the world and is often called &quot;the English Mozart&quot;. Samuel Wesley&#x27;s son, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, was one of the foremost British composers of the 19th century.

===Death and burial===

On his deathbed, he sent for the rector of St Marylebone Parish Church, John Harley, and purportedly told him &quot;Sir, whatever the world may say of me, I have lived, and I die, a member of the Church of England. I pray you to bury me in your churchyard.&quot; At the age of 80, he died on 29 March 1788 in London. His body was carried to the church by six clergy of the Church of England. A memorial stone to him stands in the gardens in Marylebone High Street, close to his place of burial. One of his sons, Samuel, became the organist at the church.

==Hymns and other works==

Wesley was a prolific hymnwriter. Among the collections (hymnals) of Wesley&#x27;s hymns published in his lifetime were &quot;Hymns on God&#x27;s Everlasting Love&quot; (1741, 1742), &quot;Hymns on the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; (1745), and &quot;Short Hymns on Select Passages of the Holy Scriptures&quot; (1762), together with others celebrating the major festivals of the Christian year. His hymns are marked by their strong doctrinal content (notably the Arminian insistence on the universality of God&#x27;s love), a richness of scriptural and literary allusion, and the variety of his metrical and stanza forms. They are considered to have had a significant influence not only on Methodism but on Christian worship and modern theology as a whole.
Wesley&#x27;s poetry included epistles, elegies and political and satirical verse. A collected edition of &quot;The Poetical Works of John and Charles Wesley&quot;, edited by George Osborn, was published in thirteen volumes in 1868–1872. Osborn&#x27;s collection has now been supplemented by the three volumes of &quot;The Unpublished Poetry of Charles Wesley&quot;.

Jason E. Vickers states that Wesley&#x27;s &#x27;conversion experience&#x27; in 1738 had a clear impact on his doctrine, especially doctrine concerning the power of the Holy Spirit. The change was most prominent in his hymns written after the same year. From his published work &quot;Hymns and Prayers to the Trinity&quot; and in Hymn number 62 he writes &quot;The Holy Ghost in part we know, For with us He resides, Our whole of good to Him we owe, Whom by His grace he guides, He doth our virtuous thoughts inspire, The evil he averts, And every seed of good desire, He planted in our hearts.&quot; Charles communicates several doctrines: the personal indwelling of the Holy Spirit, the sanctifying work of the Spirit, the depravity of mankind, and humanity&#x27;s personal accountability to God.

===Hymnody===
In the course of his career, Wesley published the words of between 6,500 and 10,000 hymns, many of which are still popular. These include:
* &quot;Arise, My Soul, Arise&quot; ()
* &quot;And Can It Be That I Should Gain?&quot; ()
* &quot;Christ the Lord Is Risen Today&quot; ()
* &quot;Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies&quot; ()
* &quot;Come, O Thou Traveller Unknown&quot; ()
* &quot;Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus&quot; ()
* &quot;Depth of Mercy, Can it Be&quot; ()
* &quot;Father, I Stretch My Hands to Thee&quot; ()
* &quot;Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise&quot; ()
* &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; ()
* &quot;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&quot; ()
* &quot;Jesus, The Name High Over All&quot; ()
* &quot;Lo! He Comes with Clouds Descending&quot; ()
* &quot;Love Divine, All Loves Excelling&quot; ()
* &quot;O for a Heart to Praise My God&quot; ()
* &quot;O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing&quot; ()
* &quot;O Thou Who Camest from Above&quot; ()
* &quot;Rejoice, the Lord is King&quot; ()
* &quot;Soldiers of Christ, Arise&quot; ()
* &quot;Sun of Unclouded Righteousness&quot; ()
* &quot;Thou Hidden Source of Calm Repose&quot; ()
* &quot;Ye Servants of God&quot; ()

The words to many more of Charles Wesley&#x27;s hymns can be found on Wikisource, and in his many publications.

Some 150 of his hymns are in the Methodist hymn book &quot;Hymns and Psalms&quot;, including &quot;Hark! the Herald Angels Sing&quot;, and &quot;The Church Hymn Book&quot; (In New York and Chicago, US, 1872) where &quot;Jesus, Lover of My Soul&quot; is published. Many of his hymns are translated into other languages, and form the foundation for Methodist hymnals, as well as the Swedish &quot;Metodist-Episkopal-Kyrkans Psalmbok&quot; printed in Stockholm in 1892.

=== Psalms ===
Wesley&#x27;s hymns are notable as interpretations of Scripture. He also produced paraphrases of the Psalms, contributing to the long tradition of English metrical Psalmody. A notable feature of his Psalms is the introduction of Jesus into the Psalms, continuing a tradition of Christological readings of the Psalms evident in the translations of John Patrick and Isaac Watts. The introduction of Jesus into the Psalms was often the source of controversy, even within Wesley&#x27;s own family. Charles&#x27; brother Samuel Wesley wrote a poem against such practice. Of particular importance is Wesley&#x27;s manuscript Psalms, held in the archives of the Pitts Theology Library at Emory University.

==Legacy==

Wesley is still remembered for his ministry while in St. Simon&#x27;s Island, Georgia, by the South Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church; in 1950, the conference opened a Christian retreat centre on the island by the banks of the Frederica River, designating it Epworth by the Sea in honour of his and John&#x27;s birthplace.

In the 19th century, Charles Wesley&#x27;s legacy was downplayed by Methodist historians, largely because of his opposition to separating from the Church of England. He is remembered (with his brother) in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 24 May.

He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 2 March with his brother. The brothers are also commemorated on 3 March in the Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church. Charles is commemorated on 29 March in the Calendar of Commemorations by the Methodist Order of Saint Luke; John is commemorated on 2 March; their parents are also commemorated.

As a result of his enduring hymnody, the Gospel Music Association recognised Wesley&#x27;s musical contributions to the art of gospel music in 1995 by listing his name in the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.

Wesley&#x27;s hymns are utilised in not only Methodist churches but other Protestant denominations, and have been adopted by the Roman Catholic Church. Wesley wrote two of the so-called Great Four Anglican Hymns: &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; and &quot;Lo! He Comes With Clouds Descending&quot;.

===Tercentenary===
24 May 2007 was celebrated as the tercentenary of Wesley&#x27;s birth, with many celebratory events held throughout England, even though Wesley was in fact born in December 1707. The date of 24 May is known to Methodists as Aldersgate Day and commemorates the spiritual awakening of first Charles and then John Wesley in 1738.

In November 2007, An Post, the Irish Post Office, issued a 78-cent stamp to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Wesley&#x27;s birth.

<text>Martha Beatrice Webb, Baroness Passfield, (née Potter; 22 January 1858 – 30 April 1943) was an English sociologist, economist, feminist and social reformer. She was among the founders of the London School of Economics and played a crucial role in forming the Fabian Society. Additionally, she authored several popular books, with her most notable being &quot;The Co-operative Movement in Great Britain&quot; and &quot;Industrial Democracy&quot;, co-authored by her husband Sidney Webb, where she coined the term &quot;collective bargaining&quot; as a way to discuss the negotiation process between an employer and a labor union. As a feminist and social reformer, she criticised the exclusion of women from various occupations as well as campaigning for the unionisation of female workers, pushing for legislation that allowed for better hours and conditions.

==Early life==
Beatrice Webb (née Potter) was born in Standish House in the village of Standish, Gloucestershire. She was the youngest of nine daughters of businessman Richard Potter and Laurencina Heyworth, the daughter of a Liverpool merchant; Laurencina was friends for a time with the prolific Victorian novelist Margaret Oliphant during the 1840s. Both women were campaigning in Liverpool at the time (see Margaret Oliphant, &quot;Autobiography&quot;, edited by Elizabeth Jay, pages 25–26). Her paternal grandfather was Liberal Party MP Richard Potter, co-founder of the &quot;Little Circle&quot;, which was key in creating the Reform Act 1832.

Beatrice faced tragedy with her sisters: one, Blanche, died by suicide in 1905 in her own house; her oldest sister, Lallie, then died due to overdose the next year in 1906. It was believed at the time that both incidents were caused by their marital relationships. Yet, Beatrice struggled with this idea because of her beliefs of gender roles and equalities:

From an early age Webb was self-taught and cited as important influences the cooperative movement and the philosopher Herbert Spencer. After her mother&#x27;s death in 1882 she acted as a hostess and companion for her father. In 1882, she began a relationship with twice-widowed Radical politician Joseph Chamberlain, by then a Cabinet minister in William Gladstone&#x27;s second government. He would not accept her need for independence as a woman and after four years of &quot;storm and stress&quot; their relationship failed.

Marriage in 1892 to Sidney Webb established a lifelong &quot;partnership&quot; of shared causes. At the beginning of 1901, Webb wrote that she and Sidney were &quot;still on our honeymoon and every year makes our relationship more tender and complete.&quot;

She and her husband were friends with the philosopher Bertrand Russell.

==&quot;My Creed and My Craft&quot;==
Beatrice Webb left an unfinished autobiography, under the general title &quot;My Creed and My Craft&quot;. At her death, aged 85, the only autobiographical work she had published was &quot;My Apprenticeship&quot; (1926). The posthumously issued &quot;Our Partnership&quot; (1948) covered the first two decades of her marriage to Sidney Webb between 1892 and 1911 and their collaboration on a variety of public issues.

In the preface to the second work, its editors refer to Webb&#x27;s: 
desire to describe truthfully her lifelong pursuit of a living philosophy, her changes of outlook and ideas, her growing distrust of benevolent philanthropy as a means of redeeming &#x27;poor suffering humanity&#x27; and her leaving of the field of abstract economic theory for the then practically unexplored paths of scientific social research. 
In 1926, when Webb had begun to prepare the second volume, &quot;Our Partnership&quot;, only to be repeatedly distracted by other more pressing commitments, the book&#x27;s editors report her finding it difficult to express &quot;her philosophy of life, her belief in the scientific method, but its purpose guided always by religious emotion.&quot;

==A pioneer in social research and policymaking==
One of Beatrice&#x27;s older sisters, Catherine, became a well-known social worker. After Catherine married Leonard Courtney, Beatrice took over her work as a voluntary rent-collector in the model dwellings at Katharine Buildings, Wapping, operated by the East End Dwellings Company.
The young Beatrice also assisted her cousin by marriage Charles Booth in his pioneering survey of the Victorian slums of London, work which eventually became the massive 17-volume &quot;Life and Labour of the People of London&quot; (1902–1903).

These experiences stimulated a critical attitude to current ideas of philanthropy.

In 1890, Beatrice Potter was introduced to Sidney Webb, whose help she sought with her research. They married in 1892, and until her death 51 years later shared political and professional activities. When her father died in January 1892, leaving Potter an endowment of £1,000 a year, she had a private income for life with which to support herself and the research projects she pursued.

The Webbs became active members of the Fabian Society. With the Fabians&#x27; support, Beatrice Webb co-authored books and pamphlets on socialism and the co-operative movement including &quot;The History of Trade Unionism&quot; (1894) and &quot;Industrial Democracy&quot; (1897). In 1895, the Fabians used part of an unexpected legacy of £10,000 from Henry Hutchinson, a solicitor from Derby, to create the London School of Economics and Political Science. Beatrice Webb also became one of the founding members of the Fabian Women&#x27;s Group in 1908. As a member of the Fabian Women&#x27;s group, she helped push for equal pay and supported the role of women in local government.

===Contributions to the theory of the co-operative movement===
Beatrice Webb made a number of important contributions to the political and economic theory of the co-operative movement.

In her 1891 book &quot;The Cooperative Movement in Great Britain&quot;, based on her experiences in Lancashire, she distinguished between &quot;co-operative federalism&quot; and &quot;co-operative individualism&quot;. She identified herself as a co-operative federalist, a school of thought which advocates consumer co-operative societies. She argued that consumers&#x27; co-operatives should be set up as co-operative wholesale societies (by forming co-operatives in which all members are co-operatives, the best historical example being the English Co-operative Wholesale Society) and that these federal co-operatives should then acquire farms or factories.

Webb dismissed the idea of worker co-operatives where the people who did the work and benefited from it had some control over how it was organised, arguing that – at the time she was writing – such ventures had proved largely unsuccessful, at least in ushering in her form of socialism led by volunteer committees of people like herself. Examples of successful worker cooperatives did of course exist, then as now. In some professions they were the norm. However, Webb&#x27;s final book, &quot;The Truth About Soviet Russia&quot; (1942), celebrated central planning. 

She also is credited with introducing the concept of “collective bargaining.”“Collective bargaining” defines the process in which unions discuss with their employers the conditions, hours, pay, and safety of their work environment.

===1909 Minority report to the Royal Commission===

For four years Beatrice Webb was a member of the Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09. The Conservative government of A. J. Balfour established the commission, which issued its final report to the Liberal government of H. H. Asquith. Beatrice was the lead author of the dissenting minority report. This sketched the outlines of a Welfare State which would:

...secure a national minimum of civilised life ... open to all alike, of both sexes and all classes, by which we meant sufficient nourishment and training when young, a living wage when able-bodied, treatment when sick, and modest but secure livelihood when disabled or aged.

With the minority report, she advocated for more aid towards those who were disabled and supported the use of outside relief for infants in workhouses, which often were in poor condition and unsafe. The &quot;Minority Report&quot; emphasized proper medical care and child-well as provisions needed to the &quot;Poor Law&quot;. 
William Beveridge, future author of the 1942 Beveridge Report that introduced the welfare state in the United Kingdom, worked as a researcher for the Webbs on the Minority Report. He was later appointed director (1919–1937) of the London School of Economics.

===Rivalries on the Left, 1901–1922===
The influence of the Webbs on the Fabian Society and its policies was attacked by H. G. Wells. For a time, he joined the Society but was critical of its cautious approach: &quot;They permeate English society with their reputed Socialism about as much as a mouse may be said to permeate a cat.&quot; For her part, Beatrice voiced disapproval of Wells&#x27; &quot;sordid intrigue&quot; with the feminist Amber Reeves, the daughter of a veteran Fabian Maud Pember Reeves. Wells responded by lampooning the couple in his 1911 novel &quot;The New Machiavelli&quot; as Altiora and Oscar Bailey, a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators.

Other rivals from the left of the Fabian Society at that time were the Guild Socialists led by the historian and economist G.D.H. Cole. Cole and his wife Margaret would later run the Fabian Research Bureau.

In 1913, the Webbs and Henry Devenish Harben, husband of suffragist and fellow Fabian, Agnes Harben, co-founded the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, a political weekly edited by Clifford Sharp with contributions from many philosophers, economists, and politicians of the day, including George Bernard Shaw and John Maynard Keynes.

The Webbs became members of the Labour Party in late 1914. At the end of World War I, Beatrice collaborated with her husband Sidney in his writings and policy statements such as &quot;Labour and the New Social Order&quot; (1918). She also campaigned for his successful election in 1922 to the parliamentary seat of coastal Seaham, a mine-working community in County Durham.

== &quot;Soviet Communism&quot; ==
In 1928, the Webbs moved to Liphook in Hampshire, where they lived until their deaths in the 1940s. Soon Sidney was a minister in the new Labour government. Observing the wider world, Beatrice wrote of &quot;Russian communism and Italian Fascism&quot; as &quot;two sides of the worship of force and the practice of cruel intolerance&quot; and she was disturbed that &quot;this spirit is creeping into the USA and even ... into Great Britain.&quot;

The frustrations and disappointments of the next few years – the election of a narrow Labour majority of MPs in May 1929, the Great Depression which began later that year, the agreement of fellow Fabian Ramsay MacDonald, after the October 1931 election, to form and head a National Government, thereby splitting the Labour Party – partly explain why Beatrice and Sidney began to look on the USSR and its leader Stalin with different eyes. 
In 1932, Webb was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA); she was the first woman elected to the fellowship. That year, Sidney and Beatrice, now in their 70s, spent two months from 21 May to late July in the Soviet Union. Their views about the Soviet economic experiment were published three years later in a massive volume, over 1,000 pages in length, entitled &quot;Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation?&quot; (1935). Most of the text was written by Sidney Webb and based on a copious study of publications and statistics provided by the Soviet embassy in London. In 1933 he made a further &quot;fact-finding&quot; trip to the USSR before publication, accompanied by their niece Barbara Drake, a prominent trade unionist and member of the Fabian Society, and by John Cripps, the son of their nephew Stafford Cripps. 

Historians have criticised the Webbs for her supposition that the methods they had developed in analysing and formulating social policy in Britain could be applied to the Soviet Union. Their book promoted and encouraged an uncritical view of Stalin&#x27;s conduct, during agrarian centralisation in the first five-year plan (1928–1933), the creation of the gulag system, and the extensive purges of the 1930s. Trotskyist historian Al Richardson later described their 1935 account of the USSR as &quot;pure Soviet propaganda at its most mendacious&quot;.

According to Archie Brown, there also seemed to be an element of deliberate deception. In the third edition of &quot;Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation&quot; (1941), for instance, the Webbs voiced the opinion that in 1937 &quot;strenuous efforts had been made, both in the trade union organisation and in the Communist Party, to cut out the deadwood&quot;. This phrase was used to reassure a wider public about the damning accusations against former leading Bolsheviks. In her diaries, Beatrice expressed her disquiet at the opening of the Moscow Trials in the summer of 1936, and after the conviction of Nikolai Bukharin in March 1938. 

&quot;Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?&quot; – in later editions the question mark was dropped, as was any public doubt the Webbs might have about the nature of the USSR – has since been roundly condemned. In the preface to an anthology of Left Book Club publications, for instance, British historian A. J. P. Taylor is quoted as calling &quot;Soviet Communism: A New Civilization&quot; &quot;the most preposterous book ever written about Russia&quot;. In the early 1930s Malcolm Muggeridge, one of Beatrice&#x27;s own family by marriage, and himself the son of a Fabian, told her in no uncertain terms of his horrified disapproval of the Soviet system. 

She was among those listed in the German-compiled &quot;Black Book&quot;.

Ivan Maisky, the Soviet Union&#x27;s ambassador to the United Kingdom during much of World War II, was friendly with Webb. In a conversation with Webb on 10 October 1939, Maisky quoted her as saying &quot;Churchill is not a true Englishman, you know. He has Negro blood. You can tell even from his appearance.&quot;

==Extended family==

In 1929 Webb&#x27;s husband, Sidney Webb, became Baron Passfield and a member of the House of Lords. Between 1929 and 1931 he served as Secretary of State for the Colonies and Secretary of State for the Dominions in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government. Beatrice did not refer to herself as Lady Passfield or expect others to do so.

Sidney and Beatrice Webb never had any children. In retirement, Beatrice would reflect on the success of their other progeny. For instance, in 1895 they had founded the London School of Economics with Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw:

In old age it is one of the minor satisfactions of life to watch the success of your children, literal children or symbolic. The London School of Economics is undoubtedly our most famous one, but the &quot;New Statesman&quot; is also creditable—it is the most successful of the general weeklies, actually making a profit on its 25,000 readers, and has absorbed two of its rivals, &quot;The Nation&quot; and the &quot;Week-End Review&quot;.

Meanwhile, the connections by marriage of their numerous nieces and nephews made Beatrice and Sidney part of the emerging new Labour establishment. Beatrice&#x27;s nephew Sir Stafford Cripps, son of her sister Theresa, became a well-known Labour politician in the 1930s and 1940s. He served as British ambassador to Moscow during the Second World War and later as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Clement Attlee. Margaret, yet another Potter sister, married the Liberal politician Henry Hobhouse, making Beatrice Webb an aunt of peace activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse and of Liberal politician Arthur Hobhouse. Another sister, Blanche, married surgeon William Harrison Cripps, brother to Theresa&#x27;s husband Charles Cripps, 1st Baron Parmoor. 

A dissonant voice entered the family after Katherine Dobbs, the daughter of Beatrice&#x27;s youngest sister Rosalind, married the journalist Malcolm Muggeridge. In the early 1930s, the young couple moved to Moscow, full of enthusiasm for the new Soviet system. Muggeridge&#x27;s experience of reporting from the Soviet Union for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, however, made him highly critical of the Webbs&#x27; optimistic views of the Soviet Union. On 29 March 1933 Beatrice referred in her diary to &quot;Malcolm&#x27;s curiously hysterical denunciation of the USSR and all its works in a letter to me...&quot; The following day she noted that &quot;The Manchester&quot; &quot;Guardian&quot; had printed &quot;another account of the famine in Russia, which certainly bears out Malcolm&#x27;s reports.&quot;

Yet, wrote Muggeridge, Beatrice &quot;went on wanting to see Kitty and me.&quot; On their last visit, Beatrice showed her niece&#x27;s husband a portrait of Lenin: &quot;She had set the picture up as though it were a Velazquez, with special lighting coming from below.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
When Beatrice Webb died in 1943, she was cremated at Woking Crematorium. The casket containing her ashes was buried in the garden of their house in Passfield Corner, as she had requested. Lord Passfield&#x27;s ashes were also buried there when he died four years later.

Shortly afterward, the nonagenarian George Bernard Shaw launched an ultimately successful petition to have the remains of both moved to Westminster Abbey. They now lie buried in the nave of the Abbey, close to the ashes of their Labour Party colleagues Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin.

Beatrice did not live to see the welfare state set up by the post-war Labour government. It was an enduring monument to her research and campaigning, before and after she married Sidney Webb. First outlined in the Minority report (Poor Law) of 1909, it would remain substantially intact until the 1980s. It is not certain that Beatrice Webb would have approved of the manner of its implementation and future management. As her niece Kitty commented:

... although it was Beatrice herself who put the 20th-century &quot;zeitgeist&quot; into its most concrete form, in the Welfare State, something in her remained sturdily Victorian to the very end. &quot;What has to be aimed at is not this or that improvement in material circumstances or physical comfort but an improvement in personal character,&quot; she wrote. She believed that citizens who were given benefits by the community ought to make an effort to improve themselves, or at least submit themselves to those who would improve them.

==Archives==
Beatrice Webb&#x27;s papers, including her diaries, form part of the Passfield archive at the London School of Economics. The Webb Diaries are now digitised and available online at the LSE&#x27;s Digital Library. Posts about Beatrice Webb regularly appear in the LSE Archives blog, Out of the box.

<doc id="177554" wikidata="Q1043906" url="?curid=177554" title="SS Carnatic">
<text>SS &quot;Carnatic&quot; was a British steamship built in 1862-63 by Samuda Brothers at Cubitt Town on the Isle of Dogs, London, for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O). She operated on the Suez to Bombay run in the last years before the Suez Canal was opened. This route gave a fast, steamship-operated route from Britain to India, connecting with similar steamships running through the Mediterranean to Alexandria, with an overland crossing to Suez. The alternative was to sail round the Cape of Good Hope, a distance at which steam ships were not, in the early 1860s, sufficiently economical to be commercially competitive with sail.

As one of the first British steamships to use a compound engine, &quot;Carnatic&quot; achieved a much better fuel economy (at 2lbs of coal per indicated horsepower-hour) than most other contemporary steamers. P&amp;O had a number of compound-engined ships built in the first half of the 1860s: &quot;Poonah&quot; (1863), &quot;Golconda&quot; (1863) and &quot;Baronda&quot; (1864).

In 1869, she ran aground on a coral reef in the Red Sea and broke apart the following morning, with the loss of 31 lives. Her wreck was rediscovered in 1984 and is now a popular scuba diving site.

==Ship history==
The ship was laid down on 30 January 1862, and was originally to be named &quot;Mysore&quot;. She was launched as &quot;Carnatic&quot; on 6 December 1862, and completed on 25 April 1863. The composite construction hull (iron-framed and wooden-planked) was fitted with square-rigged sails and a 4-cylinder compound inverted steam engine by Humphrys &amp; Tennant, providing to a single propeller.

The compound engine was unusual at the time for a British vessel. Carnatic&#x27;s boiler ran at only . Higher pressures were not allowed by the Board of Trade. The advantages of a compound engine were not fully realised at this low pressure - but the solution to the problem was to apply a large amount of superheat. The efficiency gained was a fuel usage of just over 2lbs of coal per indicated horsepower-hour. This is comparable to the achievement of the groundbreaking at 2.2lbs per indicated horsepower-hour, but at a boiler pressure of .

===Grounding===
On 12 September 1869, she ran aground on Sha`b Abu Nuhas coral reef near Shadwan Island at the mouth of the Gulf of Suez in the Red Sea. Having assessed the ship to be safe and the pumps intact, Captain P. B. Jones denied passengers&#x27; repeated requests to abandon ship, and reassured them that the ship was safe and that the P&amp;O liner &quot;Sumatra&quot; was due to pass by and would rescue them. There was a general air of calm and normality on board until about 2 a.m. on the 14th, when the rising water engulfed the ship&#x27;s boilers and the ship was left without power or light. At 11 a.m. the following morning, after 34 hours on the reef, Captain Jones had just given the order to abandon ship and the first four passengers had taken their seats in one of the lifeboats when &quot;Carnatic&quot; suddenly broke in half. Thirty-one people drowned. The survivors made it to barren island of Shadwan, where the next day the &quot;Sumatra&quot; rescued them.

&quot;Carnatic&quot; was carrying £40,000 worth of gold (well in excess of £1,000,000 in modern terms), so the wreck was the subject of a salvage operation two weeks later. All the gold was reported recovered, but persistent rumours of remaining treasure have added to the romance of the ship.

Captain Jones was recalled to England to face an official Board of Inquiry, which labelled him &quot;a skilful and experienced officer&quot;. However, the inquiry added that &quot;it appears there was every condition as regards ship, weather and light to ensure a safe voyage and there was needed only proper care. This was not done, and hence the disaster.&quot; Although Jones&#x27;s Master&#x27;s certificate was suspended for only nine months, he never returned to sea.

Rediscovered in May 1984, the wreck of the &quot;Carnatic&quot; is now a popular scuba diving site.

<text>Clifford Lee Burton (February 10, 1962 – September 27, 1986) was an American musician who served as the bassist for the thrash metal band Metallica from 1982 until his death in 1986. He is renowned for his musicianship and influence.

Burton&#x27;s early musical ventures include performing in bands such as EZ-Street and Agents of Misfortune, and frequently collaborating with guitarist Jim Martin. He was discovered by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich while performing in Los Angeles, who asked him to replace bassist Ron McGovney in Metallica. After the release of their first two albums &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; (1983) and &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; (1984), Burton and Metallica achieved their worldwide breakthrough with &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; (1986), often cited as both the band&#x27;s best work and one of the best metal albums.

While touring in 1986 to support &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, Burton died following a bus crash in Sweden. He received posthumous writing credits on &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1988) for the song &quot;To Live Is to Die&quot;. He was posthumously inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Metallica in 2009. He also appeared in a 2011 reader poll from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; recognizing the greatest bassists of all time, and on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 50 greatest bass players of all time.

== Early life ==
Burton was born in Castro Valley, California, to Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; (1925–2020) and Janette &quot;Jan&quot; Burton (1925–1993). He had two elder siblings, Scott (1958–1975) and Connie. Burton&#x27;s interest in music began when his father introduced him to classical music and began taking piano lessons.

In his teenage years, Burton developed an interest in rock, classical, country and eventually heavy metal. He began playing the bass at age 13, after the death of his brother, who died from a brain aneurysm. His parents quoted him as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be the best bassist for my brother.&quot; He practiced up to six hours per day (even after he joined Metallica). Along with classical and jazz, Burton&#x27;s other early influences varied from Southern rock and country to the blues.

Burton cited Geddy Lee, Geezer Butler, Stanley Clarke, Lemmy Kilmister, and Phil Lynott as major influences on his style of bass playing.

== Career ==
While still a student at Castro Valley High School, Burton formed his first band called EZ-Street. The band took its name from a Bay Area topless bar. Other members of EZ-Street included future Faith No More members Jim Martin and Mike Bordin. Burton and Martin continued their musical collaboration after becoming students at Chabot College in Hayward, California. Their second band, Agents of Misfortune, entered the Hayward Area Recreation Department&#x27;s Battle of the Bands contest in 1981. Their audition was recorded on video and features some of the earliest footage of Burton&#x27;s playing style. The video also shows Burton playing parts of what would soon be two Metallica songs: his signature bass solo, &quot;(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth&quot;, and the chromatic intro to &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. Burton joined his first professional band, Trauma, in 1982. He recorded the track &quot;Such a Shame&quot; with the band on the second &quot;Metal Massacre&quot; compilation.

In 1982, Trauma traveled to Los Angeles to perform at the Whisky a Go Go. Among those in attendance were James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich, both members of Metallica, which had formed the previous year. Upon hearing, as Hetfield described it, &quot;this amazing shredding&quot; (parts of which later became &quot;(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth&quot;), the two decided to recruit Burton for their own band. They asked him to replace departed bassist Ron McGovney, and since Burton thought that Trauma was &quot;starting to get a little commercial&quot;, he agreed. The idea of having to move to Los Angeles did not sit well with Burton, who said he would join only if the band relocated from Los Angeles to his native San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica, eager to have Burton in the band, left to make a home in El Cerrito, a town located across the bay from San Francisco.

Burton&#x27;s first recording with Metallica was the &quot;Megaforce&quot; demo. A demo tape the band had made prior to Burton&#x27;s joining, &quot;No Life &#x27;til Leather&quot;, managed to come into the hands of Jon Zazula, owner of Megaforce Records. The band relocated to Old Bridge, New Jersey, and quickly secured a recording contract with Zazula&#x27;s label. Their debut album, &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, features Burton&#x27;s showcase, &quot;(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth&quot;, which displayed his use of effect pedals, such as a wah-wah pedal and Electro Harmonix Big Muff, which are ‍not commonly used by ‍bassists.

Metallica&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot;, was originally intended to inherit the name of one of their earlier demo releases (predating Burton&#x27;s participation), which was &quot;Metal Up Your Ass&quot;, but the record company did not like the title and insisted on changing it. Burton said &quot;We should just kill &#x27;em all, man,&quot; which gave the band members an idea for the new title. The album was released on July 25, 1983, through Megaforce Records.

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, showcased the band&#x27;s rapidly evolving musical growth. Burton&#x27;s songwriting abilities were growing, and he received credit on six of the album&#x27;s eight songs. Burton&#x27;s playing style and use of effects is notably showcased on two tracks: the chromatic intro to &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (often mistaken as a guitar intro), and the &quot;lead bass&quot; on &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;.

The band&#x27;s improving musicianship on &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; caught the attention of major record labels. Metallica was signed to Elektra Records, and began working on their third album, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, which is considered by most critics to be a landmark album in heavy metal. Among the tracks featured in the album are the instrumental &quot;Orion&quot; (which features a prominent lead bass section) and the title track, which was Burton&#x27;s favorite Metallica song. &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; was the band&#x27;s commercial breakthrough release, and Burton&#x27;s final album with Metallica.

Burton&#x27;s final performance was in Stockholm, Sweden, at the Solnahallen Arena on September 26, 1986, one day before his death. The final song he performed was &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot; according to setlist.fm and the cassette included in the deluxe box of Master of Puppets or &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; according to the band&#x27;s homepage.

== Equipment ==

Cliff Burton played a Rickenbacker 4001 bass before joining Metallica. He removed the original pickups from the instrument, replacing the neck pickup with a Gibson &quot;Mudbucker&quot; and the bridge with a Seymour Duncan Classic Stack Jazz Bass pickup, among other modifications.

In January 2013, the guitar manufacturer Aria revealed through Metallica&#x27;s official website that it would be releasing a replica of Burton&#x27;s bass, called the Aria Pro II Cliff Burton Signature Bass. The company had received permission from Burton&#x27;s family and from ‍Metallica ‍to produce the instrument. The bass ‍was officially unveiled at Winter ‍NAMM Show in Anaheim, California. On January 25, 2013, Burton&#x27;s father Ray ‍attended the press conference where he signed autographs and talked about Burton&#x27;s life and the instrument. Current Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo was also present and was the first to try out the bass, playing parts of &quot;(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth&quot;. Ray Burton said, &quot;What a beautiful instrument and a wonderful tribute to Cliff.&quot; ‍

== Death ==

In Sweden, on the Damage Inc. tour in support of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, the band members complained that the bunks on their tour bus were unsatisfactory and uncomfortable. The story of how Burton won the bunk differs between the two band members; as Kirk Hammett stated on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, he and Burton drew cards, and Burton picked the ace of spades, thereby getting the first choice of bunk. Burton told Hammett &quot;I want your bunk&quot;. Hammett replied &quot;Fine, take my bunk, I&#x27;ll sleep up front, it&#x27;s probably better anyway&quot;. However, Ulrich&#x27;s version of the event was that Hammett and Burton drew straws, while Burton drew the long straw, winning the choice of bunk. Burton was sleeping when, according to the driver, shortly before 7 a.m. on September 27, the bus skidded off the road (the E4, north of Ljungby, just north of Dörarp) and flipped onto the grass in Kronoberg County. With no safety restraints on the bunks, Burton was thrown violently through the window of the bus, which then fell on top of him, killing him instantly. He was 24 years old.

The bus driver said that the crash was caused by the bus hitting a patch of black ice on the road, but Hetfield later stated that he first believed the bus flipped because the driver was drunk. Hetfield also stated that he walked long distances down the road looking for black ice and found none. When local freelance photographer Lennart Wennberg (who attended the crash-scene the following morning) was asked in a later interview about the likelihood that black ice caused the accident, he said it was &quot;out of the question&quot; because the road was dry and the temperature around , above the freezing point of . This was confirmed by police who, like Hetfield, also found no ice on the road. Ljungby detective Arne Pettersson was reported in a local newspaper to have said the tracks at the accident site were exactly like ones seen when drivers fall asleep at the wheel. However, the driver stated under oath that he had slept during the day and was fully rested; his testimony was confirmed by the driver of a second tour bus that was carrying the band&#x27;s crew and equipment. The driver was determined not at fault for the accident and no charges were brought against him.

Burton&#x27;s body was cremated and the ashes were scattered at the Maxwell Ranch. At the ceremony, the song &quot;Orion&quot; was played. Shortly after Burton&#x27;s death, Jason Newsted from Flotsam and Jetsam became Metallica&#x27;s new bassist.

== Legacy ==

Many metal bassists have expressed admiration, or have cited Burton as an influence to their playing. These include, Adam Duce, Alex Webster, Chi Cheng, Dick Lövgren, Johnny Christ, Justin Chancellor, Liam Wilson, Mike D&#x27;Antonio, Martín Méndez, Paolo Gregoletto, Paul Gray, Paulo Jr., Reginald Arvizu Tony Campos, and Troy Sanders. Yuke Sampruna &amp; Erwin Prasetya

Metallica wrote a tribute to Burton titled &quot;To Live Is to Die&quot; for &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. Burton also received a writing credit for the lyrics in the middle of the song, as well as the bass lines being a medley of unused recordings Burton had performed prior to his death. A non-Metallica tribute to Burton, &quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot;, was created by thrash metal band Megadeth. According to Dave Mustaine, after hearing of Burton&#x27;s death, he sat down and wrote the music for the song in one sitting. The lyrics, however, are unrelated to Burton&#x27;s death. Mustaine was Metallica&#x27;s lead guitarist in the early days and was a close friend of Burton at the time. Thrash metal band Anthrax dedicated its album &quot;Among the Living&quot; to him, as did Metal Church with &quot;The Dark&quot;.

In 2006, a memorial stone was unveiled in Sweden near the scene of the fatal crash. The lyrics &quot;...cannot the Kingdom of Salvation take me home&quot; from &quot;To Live Is to Die&quot; are written on Burton&#x27;s memorial stone. On April 4, 2009, Burton was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Metallica bandmates James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett. Subsequent bassists Jason Newsted and Robert Trujillo were inducted as well. During the ceremony, the induction was accepted by his father Ray Burton, who shared the stage with the band and said that Cliff&#x27;s mother was Metallica&#x27;s biggest fan.

A biography, &quot;To Live Is to Die: The Life and Death of Metallica&#x27;s Cliff Burton&quot;, written by Joel McIver, was published by Jawbone Press in June 2009. Hammett provided the book&#x27;s foreword.

On the “Hardwired… to Self Destruct Deluxe&quot; bonus track “Fade to Black (Live at Rasputin Music)&quot; James dedicates the song to Cliff, saying “For Cliff!” and “Can you hear us Cliff?”

A 2011 reader poll from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed Burton as the ninth greatest bassist of all time.

In 2017, it was revealed that Burton&#x27;s parents had been donating his posthumous royalty payments to a scholarship fund for music students at his alma mater Castro Valley High School. In 2018, the Alameda County, California, Board of Supervisors issued a proclamation declaring February 10, 2018, which would have been Burton&#x27;s 56th birthday, as &quot;Cliff Burton Day&quot; after a fan petition successfully passed. The &quot;S&amp;M2&quot; concert in 2019 featured San Francisco Symphony bassist Scott Pingel paying tribute to Burton by playing his signature bass solo, &quot;Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)&quot;, using an electric double bass with pedal effects.

<text>Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (; 27 January 1775 – 20 August 1854), later (after 1812) von Schelling, was a German philosopher. Standard histories of philosophy make him the midpoint in the development of German idealism, situating him between Johann Gottlieb Fichte, his mentor in his early years, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, his one-time university roommate, early friend, and later rival. Interpreting Schelling&#x27;s philosophy is regarded as difficult because of its evolving nature.

Schelling&#x27;s thought in the main has been neglected, especially in the English-speaking world. An important factor in this was the ascendancy of Hegel, whose mature works portray Schelling as a mere footnote in the development of idealism. Schelling&#x27;s &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; also has been attacked by scientists for its tendency to analogize and lack of empirical orientation. However, some later philosophers have shown interest in re-examining Schelling&#x27;s body of work.

==Life==

===Early life===
Schelling was born in the town of Leonberg in the Duchy of Württemberg (now Baden-Württemberg), the son of Joseph Friedrich Schelling and Gottliebin Marie Cleß. From 1783 to 1784, Schelling attended the Latin school in Nürtingen and knew Friedrich Hölderlin, who was five years his senior. Subsequently Schelling attended the monastic school at Bebenhausen, near Tübingen, where his father was chaplain and an Orientalist professor. On 18 October 1790, at the age of 15, he was granted permission to enroll at the Tübinger Stift (seminary of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg), despite not having yet reached the normal enrollment age of 20. At the Stift, he shared a room with Hegel as well as Hölderlin, and the three became good friends.

Schelling studied the Church fathers and ancient Greek philosophers. His interest gradually shifted from Lutheran theology to philosophy. In 1792, he graduated with his master&#x27;s thesis, titled &quot;Antiquissimi de prima malorum humanorum origine philosophematis Genes. III. explicandi tentamen criticum et philosophicum&quot;, and in 1795 he finished his doctoral thesis, titled &quot;De Marcione Paulinarum epistolarum emendatore&quot; (&quot;On Marcion as emendator of the Pauline letters&quot;) under Gottlob Christian Storr. Meanwhile, he had begun to study Kant and Fichte, who influenced him greatly. Representative of Schelling&#x27;s early period is also a discourse between him and the philosophical writer , who was Fichte&#x27;s housemate at that time, in letters and in Fichte&#x27;s Journal (1796/97) on &quot;interaction&quot;, &quot;the pragmatic&quot; and Leibniz.

In 1797, while tutoring two youths of an aristocratic family, he visited Leipzig as their escort and had a chance to attend lectures at Leipzig University, where he was fascinated by contemporary physical studies including chemistry and biology. He also visited Dresden, where he saw collections of the Elector of Saxony, to which he referred later in his thinking on art. On a personal level, this Dresden visit of six weeks from August 1797 saw Schelling meet the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel and Karl Friedrich Schlegel and his future wife Caroline (then married to August Wilhelm), and Novalis.

===Jena period===

After two years tutoring, in October 1798, at the age of 23, Schelling was called to University of Jena as an extraordinary professor of philosophy. His time at Jena (1798–1803) put Schelling at the centre of the intellectual ferment of Romanticism. He was on close terms with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who appreciated the poetic quality of the &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;, reading &quot;Von der Weltseele&quot;. As the prime minister of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar, Goethe invited Schelling to Jena. Schelling was nevertheless unsympathetic to the ethical idealism that animated the work of Friedrich Schiller, the other pillar of Weimar Classicism. Schelling&#x27;s later &quot;Vorlesung über die Philosophie der Kunst&quot; (&quot;Lecture on the Philosophy of Art&quot;, 1802/03) closely reviewed Schiller&#x27;s theory of the sublime.

In Jena, Schelling was on good terms with Fichte at first, but their different conceptions, about nature in particular, led to increasing divergence. Fichte advised him to focus on transcendental philosophy: specifically, Fichte&#x27;s own &quot;Wissenschaftlehre&quot;. But Schelling, who was becoming the acknowledged leader of the Romantic school, rejected Fichte&#x27;s thought as cold and abstract.

Schelling was especially close to August Wilhelm Schlegel and his wife, Caroline. Schelling grew close to Caroline&#x27;s young daughter, Auguste Böhmer. Caroline began considering abandoning Schlegel to marry Schelling. Auguste died of dysentery in 1800; many blamed Schelling, who had overseen her treatment. Robert Richards, however, argues in his book &quot;The Romantic Conception of Life&quot; that Schelling&#x27;s interventions were most likely irrelevant, as the doctors called to the scene assured everyone involved that Auguste&#x27;s disease was inevitably fatal. Auguste&#x27;s death drew Schelling and Caroline closer. Schlegel moved to Berlin, and Goethe helped Schlegel pursue a divorce. Schelling&#x27;s time at Jena came to an end, and on 2 June 1803 he and Caroline were married away from Jena. Their marriage ceremony was the last occasion Schelling met his school friend the poet Friedrich Hölderlin, who was already mentally ill at that time.

In his Jena period, Schelling resumed his close relationship with Hegel. With Schelling&#x27;s help, Hegel became a private lecturer (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;) at Jena University. Hegel wrote a book titled &quot;Differenz des Fichte&#x27;schen und Schelling&#x27;schen Systems der Philosophie&quot; (&quot;Difference between Fichte&#x27;s and Schelling&#x27;s Systems of Philosophy&quot;, 1801), and supported Schelling&#x27;s position against his idealistic predecessors, Fichte and Karl Leonhard Reinhold. Beginning in January 1802, Hegel and Schelling published the &quot;Kritisches Journal der Philosophie&quot; (&quot;Critical Journal of Philosophy&quot;) as co-editors, publishing papers on the philosophy of nature, but Schelling was too busy to stay involved with the editing and the magazine was mainly Hegel&#x27;s publication, espousing a thought different from Schelling&#x27;s. The magazine ceased publication in the spring of 1803 when Schelling moved to Bamberg.

===Move to Würzburg and personal conflicts===
After Jena, Schelling went to Bamberg for a time to study the Brunonian system of medicine (the theory of John Brown) with and Andreas Röschlaub. From September 1803 until April 1806 Schelling was professor at the new University of Würzburg. This period was marked by considerable flux in his views and by a final breach with Fichte and Hegel.

In Würzburg, a conservative Catholic city, Schelling found many enemies among his colleagues and in the government. He moved then to Munich in 1806, where he found a position as a state official, first as associate of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities and secretary of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, afterwards as secretary of the Philosophische Klasse (philosophical section) of the Academy of Sciences. 1806 was also the year Schelling published a book in which he criticized Fichte openly by name. In 1807 Schelling received the manuscript of Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phaenomenologie des Geistes&quot; (&quot;Phenomenology of the Spirit&quot; or &quot;Mind&quot;), which Hegel had sent to him, asking Schelling to write the foreword. Surprised to find critical remarks directed at his own philosophical theory, Schelling wrote back, asking Hegel to clarify whether he had intended to mock Schelling&#x27;s followers who lacked a true understanding of his thought, or Schelling himself. Hegel never replied. In the same year, Schelling gave a speech about the relation between the visual arts and nature at the Academy of Fine Arts; Hegel wrote a severe criticism of it to one of his friends. After that, they criticized each other in lecture rooms and in books publicly until the end of their lives.

===Munich period===
Without resigning his official position in Munich, he lectured for a short time in Stuttgart (&quot;Stuttgarter Privatvorlesungen&quot; [Stuttgart private lectures], 1810), and seven years at the University of Erlangen (1820–1827). In 1809 Caroline died, just before he published &quot;Freiheitsschrift&quot; (&quot;Freedom Essay&quot;) the last book published during his life. Three years later, Schelling married one of her closest friends, Pauline Gotter, in whom he found a faithful companion.

During the long stay in Munich (1806–1841) Schelling&#x27;s literary activity came gradually to a standstill. It is possible that it was the overpowering strength and influence of the Hegelian system that constrained Schelling, for it was only in 1834, after the death of Hegel, that, in a preface to a translation by Hubert Beckers of a work by Victor Cousin, he publicly expressed antagonism towards Hegelianism (and, by extension, his earlier thought). The antagonism certainly was not new; the 1822 Erlangen lectures on the history of philosophy expressed the same in a pointed fashion, and Schelling had already begun the treatment of mythology and religion which, in his view, constituted the true positive complements to the negative of logical or speculative philosophy.

===Berlin period===

Public attention was powerfully attracted by hints of a new system which promised something more positive, especially in its treatment of religion, than the apparent results of Hegel&#x27;s teaching. The appearance of critical writings by David Friedrich Strauss, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Bruno Bauer, and the disunion in the Hegelian school itself, expressed a growing alienation from the then dominant philosophy. In Berlin, the headquarters of the Hegelians, this found expression in attempts to obtain officially from Schelling a treatment of the new system that he was understood to have in reserve. Its realization did not come about until 1841, when Schelling&#x27;s appointment as Prussian privy councillor and member of the Berlin Academy, gave him the right, a right he was requested to exercise, to deliver lectures in the university. Among those in attendance at his lectures were Søren Kierkegaard (who said Schelling talked &quot;quite insufferable nonsense&quot; and complained that he did not end his lectures on time), Mikhail Bakunin (who called them &quot;interesting but rather insignificant&quot;), Jacob Burckhardt, Alexander von Humboldt (who never accepted Schelling&#x27;s natural philosophy), future church historian Philip Schaff and Friedrich Engels (who, as a partisan of Hegel, attended to &quot;shield the great man&#x27;s grave from abuse&quot;). The opening lecture of his course was attended by a large and appreciative audience. The enmity of his old foe, H. E. G. Paulus, sharpened by Schelling&#x27;s success, led to surreptitious publication of a verbatim report of the lectures on the philosophy of revelation. Schelling did not succeed in obtaining legal condemnation and suppression of this piracy and he stopped delivering public lectures in 1845.

==Works==
In 1793, Schelling contributed to Heinrich Eberhard Gottlob Paulus&#x27;s periodical &quot;Memorabilien&quot;. His 1795 dissertation was &quot;De Marcione Paullinarum epistolarum emendatore&quot; (&quot;On Marcion as emendator of the Pauline letters&quot;). In 1794, Schelling published an exposition of Fichte&#x27;s thought entitled &quot;Ueber die Möglichkeit einer Form der Philosophie überhaupt&quot; (&quot;On the Possibility of a Form of Philosophy in General&quot;). This work was acknowledged by Fichte himself and immediately earned Schelling a reputation among philosophers. His more elaborate work, &quot;Vom Ich als Prinzip der Philosophie, oder über das Unbedingte im menschlichen Wissen&quot; (&quot;On the I as Principle of Philosophy, or on the Unconditioned in Human Knowledge&quot;, 1795), while still remaining within the limits of the Fichtean idealism, showed a tendency to give the Fichtean method a more objective application, and to amalgamate Spinoza&#x27;s views with it. He contributed articles and reviews to the &quot;Philosophisches Journal&quot; of Fichte and Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer, and threw himself into the study of physical and medical science. In 1795 Schelling published &quot;Philosophische Briefe über Dogmatismus und Kritizismus&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Letters on Dogmatism and Criticism&quot;), consisting of 10 letters addressed to an unknown interlocutor that presented both a defense and critique of the Kantian system.

Between 1796/97, there was written a seminal manuscript now known as the &quot;Das älteste Systemprogramm des deutschen Idealismus&quot; (&quot;The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism&quot;). It survives in Hegel&#x27;s handwriting. First published in 1916 by Franz Rosenzweig, it was attributed to Schelling. It has also been claimed that Hegel or Hölderlin was the author.

In 1797, Schelling published the essay &quot;Neue Deduction des Naturrechts&quot; (&quot;New Deduction of Natural Law&quot;), which anticipated Fichte&#x27;s treatment of the topic in &quot;Grundlage des Naturrechts&quot; (&quot;Foundations of Natural Law&quot;). His studies of physical science bore fruit in &quot;Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur&quot; (&quot;Ideas Concerning a Philosophy of Nature&quot;, 1797), and the treatise &quot;Von der Weltseele&quot; (&quot;On the World-Soul&quot;, 1798). In &quot;Ideen&quot; Schelling referred to Leibniz and quoted from his &quot;Monadology&quot;. He held Leibniz in high regard because of his view of nature during his natural philosophy period.

In 1800, Schelling published &quot;System des transcendentalen Idealismus&quot; (&quot;System of Transcendental Idealism&quot;). In this book Schelling described transcendental philosophy and nature philosophy as complementary to one another. Fichte reacted by stating that Schelling&#x27;s argument was unsound: in Fichte&#x27;s theory nature as Not-Self (&quot;Nicht-Ich&quot; = object) could not be a subject of philosophy, whose essential content is the subjective activity of the human intellect. The breach became unrecoverable in 1801 after Schelling published &quot;Darstellung des Systems meiner Philosophie&quot; (&quot;Presentation of My System of Philosophy&quot;). Fichte thought this title absurd since, in his opinion, philosophy could not be personalized. Moreover, in this book Schelling publicly expressed his estimation of Spinoza, whose work Fichte had repudiated as dogmatism, and declared that nature and spirit differ only in their quantity, but are essentially identical. According to Schelling, the absolute was the indifference to identity, which he considered to be an essential philosophical subject.

The &quot;Aphorismen über die Naturphilosophie&quot; (&quot;Aphorisms on Nature Philosophy&quot;), published in the &quot;Jahrbücher der Medicin als Wissenschaft&quot; (1805–1808), are for the most part extracts from the Würzburg lectures, and the &quot;Denkmal der Schrift von den göttlichen Dingen des Herrn Jacobi&quot; (&quot;Monument to the Scripture of the Divine Things of Mr. Jacobi&quot;) was a response to an attack by Jacobi (the two accused each other of atheism). A work of significance is the 1809 &quot;Philosophische Untersuchungen über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit und die damit zusammenhängenden Gegenstände&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom&quot;), which elaborates, with increasing mysticism, on ideas in the 1804 work &quot;Philosophie und Religion&quot; (&quot;Philosophy and Religion&quot;). However, in a change from the Jena period, evil is not an appearance coming from quantitative differences between the real and the ideal, but is something substantial. This work clearly paraphrased Kant&#x27;s distinction between intelligible and empirical character. Schelling himself called freedom &quot;a capacity for good and evil&quot;.

The 1815 essay &quot;Ueber die Gottheiten zu Samothrake&quot; (&quot;On the Divinities of Samothrace&quot;) was ostensibly a part of a larger work, &quot;Weltalter&quot; (&quot;The Ages of the World&quot;), frequently announced as ready for publication, but of which little was ever written. Schelling planned &quot;Weltalter&quot; as a book in three parts, describing the past, present, and future of the world; however, he began only the first part, rewriting it several times and at last keeping it unpublished. The other two parts were left only in planning. Christopher John Murray describes the work as follows:
Building on the premise that philosophy cannot ultimately explain existence, he merges the earlier philosophies of Nature and identity with his newfound belief in a fundamental conflict between a dark unconscious principle and a conscious principle in God. God makes the universe intelligible by relating to the ground of the real but, insofar as nature is not complete intelligence, the real exists as a lack within the ideal and not as reflective of the ideal itself. The three universal ages – distinct only to us but not in the eternal God – therefore comprise a beginning where the principle of God before God is divine will striving for being, the present age, which is still part of this growth and hence a mediated fulfillment, and a finality where God is consciously and consummately Himself to Himself.
No authentic information on Schelling&#x27;s new positive philosophy (&quot;positive Philosophie&quot;) was available until after his death at Bad Ragatz, on 20 August 1854. His sons then issued four volumes of his Berlin lectures: vol. i. &quot;Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology&quot; (1856); ii. &quot;Philosophy of Mythology&quot; (1857); iii. and iv. &quot;Philosophy of Revelation&quot; (1858).

==Periodization==
Schelling, at all stages of his thought, called to his aid outward forms of some other system. Fichte, Spinoza, Jakob Boehme and the mystics, and finally, major Greek thinkers with their Neoplatonic, Gnostic, and Scholastic commentators, give colouring to particular works. In Schelling&#x27;s own view, his philosophy fell into three stages. These were:
#Transition from Fichte&#x27;s philosophy to a more objective conception of nature (an advance to &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;)
#Formulation of the identical, indifferent, absolute substratum of both nature and spirit (&quot;Identitätsphilosophie&quot;).
#Opposition of negative and positive philosophy, which was the theme of his Berlin lectures, though the concepts can be traced back to 1804.

===&quot;Naturphilosophie&quot;===
The function of Schelling&#x27;s &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real. The change which experience brings before us leads to the conception of duality, the polar opposition through which nature expresses itself. The dynamic series of stages in nature are matter as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces, light (with its subordinate processes of magnetism, electricity, and chemical action) and organism (with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility).

Schelling initially adopted the concept of self-organization as Kant had developed it in his &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; for the reproduction of organisms. However, Schelling extended this concept by the aspect of the original emergence of life as well as the emergence of new species and genera. He intended it to be a comprehensive theory of natural history that bears similarities to modern theories of self-organization.

==Reputation and influence==
Some scholars characterize Schelling as a protean thinker who, although brilliant, jumped from one subject to another and lacked the synthesizing power needed to arrive at a complete philosophical system. Others challenge the notion that Schelling&#x27;s thought is marked by profound breaks, instead arguing that his philosophy always focused on a few common themes, especially human freedom, the absolute, and the relationship between spirit and nature. Unlike Hegel, Schelling did not believe that the absolute could be known in its true character through rational inquiry alone.

Schelling is still studied, although his reputation has varied over time. His work impressed the English romantic poet and critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who introduced his ideas into English-speaking culture, sometimes without full acknowledgment, as in the &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;. Coleridge&#x27;s critical work was influential, and it was he who introduced into English literature Schelling&#x27;s concept of the unconscious. Schelling&#x27;s &quot;System of Transcendental Idealism&quot; has been seen as a precursor of Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot; (1899).

The Catholic Tübingen school, a group of Roman Catholic theologians at the University of Tübingen in the nineteenth century, was greatly influenced by Schelling and attempted to reconcile his philosophy of revelation with Catholic theology. 

Up to 1950, Schelling was almost a forgotten philosopher even in Germany. In the 1910s and 1920s, philosophers of neo-Kantianism and neo-Hegelianism, like Wilhelm Windelband or Richard Kroner, tended to describe Schelling as an episode connecting Fichte and Hegel. His late period tended to be ignored, and his philosophies of nature and of art in the 1790s and first decade of the 19th century were the main focus. In this context Kuno Fischer characterized Schelling&#x27;s early philosophy as &quot;aesthetic idealism&quot;, focusing on the argument where he ranked art as &quot;the sole document and the eternal organ of philosophy&quot; (&quot;das einzige wahre und ewige Organon zugleich und Dokument der Philosophie&quot;). From socialist philosophers like György Lukács, he was regarded as anachronistic. Martin Heidegger, during the period when he was involved with the Nazi Party, found in Schelling&#x27;s &quot;On Human Freedom&quot; central themes of Western ontology – being, existence, and freedom – and expounded on them in his 1936 lectures.

In the 1950s, the situation began to change. In 1954, the centennial of his death, an international conference on Schelling was held. Several philosophers, including Karl Jaspers, gave presentations about the uniqueness and relevance of his thought, the interest shifting toward his later work on the origin of existence. Schelling was the subject of Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s 1954 dissertation.

In 1955, Jaspers published &quot;Schelling&quot;, representing him as a forerunner of the existentialists and Walter Schulz, one of organizers of the 1954 conference, published &quot;Die Vollendung des Deutschen Idealismus in der Spätphilosophie Schellings&quot; (&quot;The Perfection of German Idealism in Schelling&#x27;s Late Philosophy&quot;) claiming that Schelling had made German idealism complete with his late philosophy, particularly with his Berlin lectures in the 1840s. Schulz presented Schelling as the person who resolved the philosophical problems which Hegel had left incomplete, in contrast to the contemporary idea that Schelling had been surpassed by Hegel much earlier. Theologian Paul Tillich wrote: &quot;what I learned from Schelling became determinative of my own philosophical and theological development&quot;. Maurice Merleau-Ponty likened his own project of natural ontology to Schelling&#x27;s in his 1957–58 Course on Nature.

In the 1970s, nature was again of interest to philosophers in relation to environmental issues. Schelling&#x27;s philosophy of nature, particularly his intention to construct a program which covers both nature and the intellectual life in a single system and method, and restore nature as a central theme of philosophy, has been reevaluated in the contemporary context. His influence and relation to the German art scene, particularly to Romantic literature and visual art, has been an interest since the late 1960s, from Philipp Otto Runge to Gerhard Richter and Joseph Beuys. This interest has been revived in recent years through the work of the environmental philosopher Arran Gare who has identified a tradition of Schellingian science overcoming the opposition between science and the humanities, and offering the basis for an understanding of ecological science and ecological philosophy.

In relation to psychology, Schelling was considered to have coined the term &quot;unconsciousness&quot;. Slavoj Žižek has written two books attempting to integrate Schelling&#x27;s philosophy, mainly his middle period works including &quot;Weltalter&quot;, with work of Jacques Lacan. The opposition and division in God and the problem of evil in God examined by the later Schelling influenced Luigi Pareyson&#x27;s thought.

*&quot;Now if the appearance of &quot;freedom&quot; is necessarily infinite, the total evolution of the Absolute is also an infinite process, and history itself a never wholly completed revelation of that Absolute which, for the sake of consciousness, and thus merely for the sake of appearance, separates itself into conscious and unconscious, the free and the intuitant; but which &quot;itself&quot;, however, in the inaccessible light wherein it dwells, is Eternal Identity and the everlasting ground of harmony between the two.&quot; (&quot;System of Transcendental Idealism&quot;, 1800)
*&quot;Has creation a final goal? And if so, why was it not reached at once? Why was the consummation not realized from the beginning? To these questions there is but one answer: Because God is &quot;Life&quot;, and not merely Being.&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Inquiries into the Nature of Human Freedom&quot;, 1809)

*&quot;God then has no beginning only insofar as there is no beginning of his beginning. The beginning in God is eternal beginning, that is, such a one as was beginning from all eternity, and still is, and also never ceases to be beginning.&quot; (Quoted in Hartshorne &amp; Reese, &quot;Philosophers Speak of God&quot;, Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1953, p. 237.)

<text>Joseph Glanvill (1636 – 4 November 1680) was an English writer, philosopher, and clergyman. Not himself a scientist, he has been called &quot;the most skillful apologist of the virtuosi&quot;, or in other words the leading propagandist for the approach of the English natural philosophers of the later 17th century. In 1661 he predicted &quot;To converse at the distance of the Indes by means of sympathetic conveyances may be as natural to future times as to us is a literary correspondence.&quot;

==Life==
He was raised in a strict Puritan household, and educated at Oxford University, where he graduated B.A. from Exeter College in 1655, M.A. from Lincoln College in 1658.

Glanvill was made vicar of Frome in 1662, and was a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1664. He was rector of the Abbey Church at Bath from 1666 to 1680, and prebendary of Worcester in 1678.

==Works and views==
He was a Latitudinarian thinker. Latitudinarians generally respected the Cambridge Platonists, and Glanvill was friendly with and much influenced by Henry More, a leader in that group where Glanvill was a follower. It was Glanvill&#x27;s style to seek out a &quot;middle way&quot; on contemporary philosophical issues. His writings display a variety of beliefs that may appear contradictory. There is discussion of Glanvill&#x27;s thought and method in Basil Willey&#x27;s &quot;Seventeenth Century Background&quot; (1934).

===Rationality and plain talking===
He was the author of &quot;The Vanity of Dogmatizing&quot; (editions from 1661), which attacked scholasticism and religious persecution. It was a plea for religious toleration, the scientific method, and freedom of thought. It also contained a tale that became the material for Matthew Arnold&#x27;s Victorian poem &quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot;.

Glanvill was at first a Cartesian, but shifted his ground a little, engaging with scepticism and proposing a modification in &quot;Scepsis Scientifica&quot; (1665), a revision and expansion of &quot;The Vanity of Dogmatizing&quot;. It started with an explicit &quot;Address to the Royal Society&quot;; the Society responded by electing him as Fellow. He continued in a role of spokesman for his type of limited sceptical approach, and the Society&#x27;s production of useful knowledge. As part of his programme, he argued for a plain use of language, undistorted as to definitions and reliance on metaphor. He also advocated with &quot;Essay Concerning Preaching&quot; (1678) simple speech, rather than bluntness, in preaching, as Robert South did, with hits at nonconformist sermons; he was quite aware that the term &quot;plain&quot; takes a great deal of unpacking.

In &quot;Essays on Several Important Subjects in Philosophy and Religion&quot; (1676) he wrote a significant essay &quot;The Agreement of Reason and Religion&quot;, aimed at least in part at nonconformism. Reason, in Glanvill&#x27;s view, was incompatible with being a dissenter. In &quot;Antifanatickal Religion and Free Philosophy&quot;, another essay from the volume, he attacked the whole tradition of imaginative illumination in religion, going back to William Perkins, as founded on the denigration of reason. This essay has the subtitle &quot;Continuation of the New Atlantis&quot;, and so connects with Francis Bacon&#x27;s utopia. In an allegory, Glanvill placed the &quot;Young Academicians&quot;, standing for the Cambridge Platonists, in the midst of intellectual troubles matching the religious upheavals seen in Britain. They coped by combining modern with ancient thought. Glanvill thought, however, that the world cannot be deduced from reason alone. Even the supernatural cannot be solved from first principles and must be investigated empirically. As a result, Glanvill attempted to investigate supposed supernatural incidents through interviews and examination of the scene of the events.

===The supernatural===
He is known also for &quot;Saducismus Triumphatus&quot; (1681), an enlargement of his &quot;Blow at Modern Sadducism&quot; (1668), which was published after Glanvill&#x27;s death by Henry More. The work decried scepticism about the existence and supernatural power of witchcraft and contained a collection of seventeenth-century folklore about witches, including one of the earliest descriptions of a witch bottle. Joseph made known the existence of witchcraft. It developed as a compendium (with multiple authorship) from &quot;Philosophical Considerations Touching the Being of Witches and Witchcraft&quot; (1666), addressed to Robert Hunt, a Justice of the Peace active from the 1650s against witches in Somerset (where Glanvill had his living at Frome); the 1668 version &quot;A Blow at Modern Sadducism&quot; promoted the view that the judicial procedures such as Hunt&#x27;s court offered should be taken as adequate tests of evidence, because to argue otherwise was to undermine society at its legal roots. His biographer Ferris Greenslet attributed Glanvill&#x27;s interest in the topic to a house party in February 1665 at Ragley Hall, home of Lady Anne Conway, where other guests were More, Francis van Helmont, and Valentine Greatrakes. In the matter of the Drummer of Tedworth, a report of poltergeist-type activity from 1662 to 1663, More and Glanvill had in fact already corresponded about it in 1663.

&quot;Saducismus Triumphatus&quot; deeply influenced Cotton Mather&#x27;s &quot;Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; (1693), written to justify the Salem witch trials in the following year. It was also taken as a target when Francis Hutchinson set down &quot;An Historical Essay Concerning Witchcraft&quot; (1718); both books made much of reports from Sweden, and included by Glanvill as editor, which had experienced a moral panic about witchcraft after 1668.

Jonathan Israel writes:

These and others (Richard Baxter, Meric Casaubon, George Sinclair) believed that the tide of scepticism on witchcraft, setting in strongly by about 1670, could be turned back by research and sifting of the evidence. Like More, Glanvill believed that the existence of spirits was well documented in the Bible, and that the denial of spirits and demons was the first step towards atheism. Atheism led to rebellion and social chaos and therefore had to be overcome by science and the activities of the learned. Israel cites a letter from More to Glanvill, from 1678 and included in &quot;Saducismus Triumphatus&quot;, in which he says that followers of Thomas Hobbes and Baruch Spinoza use scepticism about &quot;spirits and angels&quot; to undermine belief in the Scripture mentioning them.

&quot;Saducismus Triumphatus&quot; was also translated into German in 1701. The German edition was used extensively by Peter Goldschmidt in his similar work &quot;Verworffener Hexen- und Zauberer-Advocat&quot; (1705). This work brought the &quot;Saducismus Triumphatus&quot; to the attention of Christian Thomasius, a philosopher, legal professor and sceptic in Halle. Over the next 21 years, Thomasius published translations of works by English sceptics: John Webster and Francis Hutchinson, as well as John Beaumont&#x27;s &quot;An Historical, Physiological and Theological Treatise of Spirits&quot;, all of which were accompanied by vitriolic prefaces attacking Glanvill, Goldschmidt and their belief in witchcraft.

===Atheism, scepticism and Aristotle===

His views did not prevent Glanvill himself being charged with atheism. This happened after he engaged in a controversy with Robert Crosse, over the continuing value of the work of Aristotle, the classical exponent of the middle way. In defending himself and the Royal Society, in &quot;Plus ultra&quot;, he attacked current teaching of medicine (physick), and in return was attacked by Henry Stubbe, in &quot;The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus&quot; (1670). His views on Aristotle also led to an attack by Thomas White, the Catholic priest known as Blacklo. In &quot;A Praefatory Answer to Mr. Henry Stubbe&quot; (1671) he defined the &quot;philosophy of the virtuosi&quot; cleanly: the &quot;plain objects of sense&quot; to be respected, as the locus of as much certainty as was available; the &quot;suspension of assent&quot; absent adequate proof; and the claim for the approach as &quot;equally an adversary to scepticism and credulity&quot;. To White he denied being a sceptic. A contemporary view is that his approach was a species of rational fideism.

His &quot;Philosophia Pia&quot; (1671) was explicitly about the connection between the &quot;experimental philosophy&quot; of the Royal Society and religion. It was a reply to a letter of Meric Casaubon, one of the Society&#x27;s critics, to Peter du Moulin. He used it to cast doubt on the roots of enthusiasm, one of his main targets amongst the nonconformists. It also dealt with criticisms of Richard Baxter, who was another accusing the Society of an atheist tendency.

<text>The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) is NASA&#x27;s center for human spaceflight in Houston, Texas (originally named the Manned Spacecraft Center), where human spaceflight training, research, and flight control are conducted. It was renamed in honor of the late U.S. president and Texas native, Lyndon B. Johnson, by an act of the United States Senate on February 19, 1973.

JSC consists of a complex of 100 buildings constructed on in Clear Lake. The center is home to NASA&#x27;s astronaut corps, and is responsible for training astronauts from both the U.S. and its international partners. It also houses the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, which has provided the flight control function for every NASA human spaceflight since Gemini 4 (including Apollo, Skylab, Apollo–Soyuz, and Space Shuttle). It is popularly known by its radio call signs &quot;Mission Control&quot; and &quot;Houston&quot;.

The original Manned Spacecraft Center grew out of the Space Task Group (STG) headed by Robert R. Gilruth that was formed to coordinate the U.S. crewed spaceflight program. The STG was based at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, but reported organizationally to the Goddard Space Flight Center just outside Washington, D.C. To meet the growing needs of the US human spaceflight program, plans began in 1961 to expand its staff to its own organization, and move it to a new facility. This was constructed in 1962 and 1963 on land donated by the Humble Oil company through Rice University, and officially opened its doors in September 1963. Today, JSC is one of ten major NASA field centers and the city of Houston&#x27;s primary cultural footprint, earning it the official nickname &quot;Space City&quot; in 1967.

==History==

Johnson Space Center has its origins in NASA&#x27;s Space Task Group (STG). Starting on November 5, 1958, Langley Research Center engineers under Robert R. Gilruth directed Project Mercury and follow-on crewed space programs. The STG originally reported to the Goddard Space Flight Center organization, with a total staff of 45, including 37 engineers, and eight secretaries and human &quot;computers&quot; (women who ran calculations on mechanical adding machines). In 1959, the center added 32 Canadian engineers put out of work by the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow project. NASA&#x27;s first administrator, T. Keith Glennan, realized that the growth of the U.S. space program would cause the STG to outgrow the Langley and Goddard centers and require its own location. On January 1, 1961, he wrote a memo to his yet-unnamed successor (who turned out to be James E. Webb), recommending a new site be chosen. Later that year, when President John F. Kennedy set the goal to put a person on the Moon by the end of the decade, it became clear Gilruth would need a larger organization to lead the Apollo Program, with new test facilities and research laboratories.

===Site selection===

In 1961, Congress held hearings and passed a $1.7 billion 1962 NASA appropriations bill which included $60 million for the new crewed spaceflight laboratory. A set of requirements for the new site was drawn up and released to the Congress and general public. These included: access to water transport by large barges, a moderate climate, availability of all-weather commercial jet service, a well-established industrial complex with supporting technical facilities and labor, close proximity to a culturally attractive community in the vicinity of an institution of higher education, a strong electric utility and water supply, at least of land, and certain specified cost parameters. In August 1961, Webb asked Associate Director of the Ames Research Center John F. Parsons to head a site-selection team, which included Philip Miller, Wesley Hjornevik, and I. Edward Campagna, the construction
engineer for the STG. The team initially came up with a list of 22 cities based on the climate and water criteria, then cut this to a short list of nine with nearby federal facilities:
* Jacksonville, Florida (Green Cove Springs Naval Air Station)
* Tampa, Florida (MacDill Air Force Base)
* Baton Rouge, Louisiana
* Shreveport, Louisiana (Barksdale Air Force Base)
* Houston, Texas (San Jacinto Ordnance Depot)
* Victoria, Texas (FAA Airport; former Foster Air Force Base)
* Corpus Christi, Texas (Naval Air Station Corpus Christi)
* San Diego, California (Camp Elliott)
* San Francisco, California (Benicia Arsenal)
Another 14 sites were then added, including two additional Houston sites chosen because of proximity to Rice University. The team visited all 23 sites between August 21 and September 7, 1961. During these visits, Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe and Senator Margaret Chase Smith headed a delegation which exerted particularly strong political pressure, prompting a personal inquiry to Webb from President Kennedy. Senators and congressmen from sites in Missouri and California similarly lobbied the selection team. Proponents of sites in Boston, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Norfolk, Virginia, went so far as to make separate presentations to Webb and the headquarters staff, so Webb added these additional sites to the final review.

Following its tour, the team identified MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa as its first choice, based on the fact the Air Force was planning to close down its Strategic Air Command operations there. The Houston Rice University site was second, and the Benicia Ordnance Depot in San Francisco was third. Before a decision could be made, however, the Air Force decided not to close MacDill, omitting it from consideration and moving the Rice University site to first place. Webb informed President Kennedy on September 14 of the decision made by him and deputy administrator Hugh Dryden in two separate memoranda, one reviewing the criteria and procedures, and the other stating: &quot;Our decision is that this laboratory should be located in Houston, Texas, in close association with Rice University and the other educational institutions there and in that region.&quot; The Executive Office and NASA made advance notifications of the award, and the public announcement of the location followed on September 19, 1961. According to Texas A&amp;M University historian Henry C. Dethloff, &quot;Although the Houston site neatly fit the criteria required for the new center, Texas undoubtedly exerted an enormous political influence on such a decision. Lyndon B. Johnson was Vice President and head of the Space Council, Albert Thomas headed the House Appropriations Committee, Bob Casey and Olin E. Teague were members of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, and Teague headed the Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight. Finally, Sam Rayburn was Speaker of the House of Representatives.&quot;

The land for the new facility was donated to Rice by the Humble Oil company, situated in an undeveloped area southeast of Houston adjacent to Clear Lake near Galveston Bay. At the time, the land was used to graze cattle. Immediately after Webb&#x27;s announcement, Gilruth and his staff began planning the move from Langley to Houston, using what would grow to of leased office and laboratory space in 11 scattered sites. On November 1, the conversion of the Task Group to MSC became official.

===Construction and early operations===

Tracts of land in the vicinity of the Manned Spacecraft Center were either owned or being under exclusive control of Joseph L. Smith &amp; Associates, Inc.
NASA purchased an additional so the property would face a highway, and the total included another reserve drilling site. Construction of the center, designed by Charles Luckman, began in April 1962, and Gilruth&#x27;s new organization was formed and moved to the temporary locations by September. That month, Kennedy gave a speech at Rice University on the U.S. space program. The speech is famous for highlighting the Apollo program, but Kennedy also made reference to the new Center:

The facility was officially opened for business in September 1963.

====Mission Control Center====
In 1961, as plans for Project Gemini began, it became increasingly clear that the Mercury Control Center located at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch center would become inadequate to control missions with maneuverable spacecraft such as Gemini and Apollo. Christopher Kraft and three other flight controllers began studying what was needed for an improved control center, and directed a study contract awarded to Philco&#x27;s Western Development Laboratory. Philco bid on and won the contract to build the electronic equipment for the new Mission Control Center, which would be located in Building 30 of MSC rather than Canaveral or the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Construction began in 1963.

The new center had two Mission Operations Control Rooms, allowing training and preparation for a later mission to be carried out while a live mission is in progress. It was brought online for testing purposes during the uncrewed Gemini 2 flight in January 1965 and the first crewed Gemini flight, Gemini 3 in March 1965, though the Mercury Control Center still retained primary responsibility for control of these flights. It became fully operational for the flight of Gemini 4 the following June, and has been the primary flight control center for all subsequent U.S. crewed space missions from Project Gemini forward.

NASA named the center the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center on April 14, 2011.

===Apollo program===
In addition to housing NASA&#x27;s astronaut operations, JSC is also the site of the former Lunar Receiving Laboratory, where the first astronauts returning from the Moon were quarantined, and where the majority of lunar samples are stored. The center&#x27;s Landing and Recovery Division operated MV &quot;Retriever&quot; in the Gulf of Mexico for Gemini and Apollo astronauts to practice water egress after splashdown.

On February 19, 1973, four weeks after Johnson&#x27;s death, President Richard Nixon signed into law a Senate resolution renaming the Manned Spacecraft Center in his honor. As Senate Majority Leader, Johnson had sponsored the 1958 legislation which created NASA; dedication ceremonies were held six months later on August 27.

One of the artifacts displayed at Johnson Space Center is the Saturn V rocket. It is whole, except for the ring between the S-IC and S-II stages, and the fairing between the S-II and S-IVB stages, and made of actual surplus flight-ready articles. It also has real (though incomplete) Apollo command and service modules, intended to fly in the canceled Apollo 19 mission.

In June 2019, the restored Apollo Mission Control Center was opened for tourists.

===Space Shuttle program===

In the wake of the January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan traveled to JSC on January 31 to speak at a memorial service honoring the astronauts. It was attended by 6,000 NASA employees and 4,000 guests, as well as by the families of the crew. During the ceremony, an Air Force band led the singing of &quot;God Bless America&quot; as NASA T-38 Talon supersonic jets flew directly over the scene in the traditional missing-man formation. All activities were broadcast live by the national television and radio networks.

A similar memorial service was held at the Johnson Space Center on February 4, 2003, for the astronauts who perished in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster three days before, which was attended by President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. Although that service was broadcast live by the national television and radio networks, it was geared mainly to NASA employees and the families of the astronauts. A second service for the nation was led by Vice-President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne at Washington National Cathedral two days later.

On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike hit Galveston as a category 2 hurricane and caused minor damage to the Mission Control Center and other buildings at JSC. The storm damaged the roofs of several hangars for the T-38 Talons at Ellington Field.

==Facilities==
The Johnson Space Center is home to Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center (MCC-H), the NASA control center that coordinates and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States. MCC-H directed all Space Shuttle missions, and currently directs American activities aboard the International Space Station. The Apollo Mission Control Center, a National Historic Landmark, is in Building 30. From the moment a crewed spacecraft clears its launch tower until it lands back on Earth, it is in the hands of Mission Control. The MCC houses several Flight Control Rooms, from which flight controllers coordinate and monitor the spaceflights. The rooms have many computer resources to monitor, command, and communicate with spacecraft. When a mission is underway, the rooms are staffed around the clock, usually in three shifts.

JSC handles most of the planning and training of the U.S. astronaut corps and houses training facilities such as the Sonny Carter Training Facility and the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, a critical component in training astronauts for spacewalks. The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory provides a controlled neutral buoyancy environment—a very large pool containing about 6.2 million U.S. gallons (23,000 m3) of water where astronauts train to practice extra-vehicular activity tasks while simulating zero-g conditions. The facility provides preflight training in becoming familiar with crew activities and with the dynamics of body motion under weightless conditions.

Building 31-N houses the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility, which stores, analyzes, and processes most of the samples returned from the Moon during the Apollo program.

The center is also responsible for direction of operations at White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, which served as a backup Space Shuttle landing site and would have been the coordinating facility for the Constellation program, which was planned to replace the Shuttle program after 2010, but was canceled in 2009.

The visitor center has been the adjacent Space Center Houston since 1994; JSC Building 2 previously housed the visitor center.

The Johnson Space Center Heliport is located on the campus.

==Personnel and training==

About 3,200 civil servants, including 110 astronauts, are employed at Johnson Space Center. The bulk of the workforce consists of over 11,000 contractors. As of October 2014, Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies took over United Space Alliance&#x27;s primary contract. the center&#x27;s director is Vanessa E. Wyche.

NASA&#x27;s astronaut training is conducted at the Johnson Space Center. Astronaut candidates receive training on spacecraft systems and in basic sciences including mathematics, guidance and navigation, oceanography, orbital dynamics, astronomy, and physics. Candidates are required to complete military water survival prior to beginning their flying instruction. Candidates are also required to become scuba-qualified for extravehicular training and are required to pass a swimming test. EVA training is conducted at the Sonny Carter Training Facility. Candidates are also trained to deal with emergencies associated with hyperbaric and hypobaric atmospheric pressures and are given exposure to the microgravity of space flight. Candidates maintain their flying proficiency by flying 15 hours per month in NASA&#x27;s fleet of T-38 jets based at nearby Ellington Field.

==Research==
Johnson Space Center leads NASA&#x27;s human spaceflight-related scientific and medical research programs. Technologies developed for spaceflight are now in use in many areas of medicine, energy, transportation, agriculture, communications, and electronics.

The Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES) office performs the physical science research at the center. ARES directs and manages all functions and activities of the ARES scientists who perform basic research in earth, planetary, and space sciences. ARES scientists and engineers provide support to the human and robotic spaceflight programs. The responsibilities of ARES also include interaction with the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance and the Human Space Flight Programs.

Johnson Space Center was granted a five-year, $120-million extension of its agreement with the National Space Biomedical Research Institute at Baylor College of Medicine to study the health risks related to long-duration space flight. The extension will allow a continuation of biomedical research in support of a long-term human presence in space started by the institute and NASA&#x27;s Human Research Program through 2012.

The Prebreathe Reduction Program is a research study program at the JSC that is currently being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of space walks from the International Space Station.

The Overset Grid-Flow software was developed at Johnson Space Center in collaboration with NASA Ames Research Center. The software simulates fluid flow around solid bodies using computational fluid dynamics.

The Texas Space Commission was established by Texas governor Greg Abbott on March 26, 2024 at Johnson Space Center.

==Memorial Grove==
Astronauts, center directors, and other NASA employees are memorialized in a Memorial Grove near the main entrance and visitor badging center (building 110). Trees dedicated to the memory of astronauts and center directors are in a round cluster closest to the entrance, other employees are memorialized behind along a road on the facility leading to the main entrance.

==Space Shuttle retirement==
JSC put in a bid to display one of the retired Space Shuttle orbiters, but was not selected.

<text>Otto Pfleiderer (1 September 1839 – 18 July 1908) was a German Protestant theologian. Through his writings and his lectures, he became known as one of the most influential representatives of liberal theology.

==Biography==
Pfleiderer was born at Stetten im Remstal (now a part of Kernen, Baden-Württemberg) in Württemberg. From 1857 to 1861 he studied at the University of Tübingen under Ferdinand Christian Baur, and afterwards in England and Scotland. He then entered the ministry, became tutor () at Tübingen, and for a short time held a pastorate at Heilbronn (1868). In 1870 he became chief pastor and superintendent at the University of Jena and soon afterwards professor ordinarius of theology, but in 1875 he was called to the chair of systematic theology at Berlin, having made his name by a series of articles on New Testament criticism and Johannine and Pauline theology, which appeared in Adolf Hilgenfeld&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie&quot;, and by his &quot;Der Paulinismus&quot;, published in 1873. &quot;Das Urchristentum, seine Schriften und Lehren, in geschichtlichen Zusammenhang beschrieben&quot; was published in 1878 and considerably enlarged for a second edition in 1902.

In 1890 appeared &quot;The Development of Theology since Kant, and its Progress in Great Britain since 1825&quot;, which was written for publication in England. A more elaborate work was his &quot;Religionsphilosophie auf geschichtlichen Grundlage&quot; (1878). &quot;The Influence of the Apostle Paul on the Development of Christianity&quot; was the title of a course of Hibbert Lectures given in London in 1885. In 1894 he delivered the Gifford Lectures at Edinburgh, the subject being &quot;The Philosophy and Development of Religion&quot;. His later publications included:
* &quot;The Early Christian Conception of Christ&quot; (1905)
* &quot;Die Entstehung des Christentums&quot; (1905)
* &quot;Religion und Religionen&quot; (1906)
* &quot;Die Entwicklung des Christentums&quot; (1907).

He died at , near Berlin. In New Testament criticism, Pfleiderer belonged to the critical school, which grew out of the impulse given by F. C. Baur. However, like other modern German theologians, he showed a greater disposition to compromise. All his work shows a judicial tone of mind, and is remarkable for the charm of its style.

Pfleiderer&#x27;s younger brother Edmund Pfleiderer distinguished himself both in philosophy and theology.

<text>The Shetland Sheepdog, also known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog that originated in the Shetland Islands of Scotland. It was formally recognized by the Kennel Club in 1909. It was originally called the Shetland Collie, but this caused controversy amongst Rough Collie breeders of the time, so the name was changed. It is a small dog, clever, vocal, willing to please, and trustworthy. 

Like the Shetland pony, Shetland cattle, and the Shetland sheep, the Shetland Sheepdog is a hardy but diminutive breed developed to thrive amidst the harsh and meagre conditions of its native islands. While the Shetland still excels at herding, today it is often raised as a working dog or family pet.

The Shetland&#x27;s origins are obscure, but it is not a direct descendant of the Rough Collie, which it largely resembles. Rather, the Shetland is a descendant of small specimens of the Scottish Collie and the King Charles Spaniel. They were originally a small mixed-breed dog, often only about in height at the shoulder, and it is thought that the original Shetland herding dogs were of the Spitz type, and were crossed with Collies from mainland Britain. In the early 20th century, James Loggie added a small Rough Collie to the breeding stock, and helped establish the breed that would become the modern Shetland Sheepdog.

==History==

Unlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts, this breed was not developed simply by selectively breeding the Rough Collie for smaller and smaller size. The original sheepdog of Shetland was a Spitz-type dog, probably similar to the modern Icelandic Sheepdog. Strong evidence suggests that this dog was bred with the &quot;Yakki&quot;, an Icelandic dog that accompanied whalers from Greenland who landed in the ports of the island. The Yakki was about in height and usually black with tan or white markings. Many of the early Shetlands were black and white or black and tan and this colouring can still be see in the muzzle of some sables dogs today whose muzzles are referred to as &quot;smutty muzzles&quot;. Folk tales also mention a King Charles Spaniel that came from a yacht. Pomeranian dog ancestry is likely given the appearance of the breed. The first club for the breed called for a dog similar to the Rough Collie except in size, the standard called for dogs to be no taller than . Other clubs called for similar standards with the breed to essentially be a miniature. These standards led to people adding in collie blood to the breed to achieve said type. The Kennel Club originally refused to recognise the breed but later agreed to on the condition the name was changed from Shetland Collie due to opposition from collie breed clubs. The original Spitz-type working sheepdog of Shetland is now extinct, having been replaced for herding there by the Border Collie. Shetlands were used for herding until commercial livestock farming required larger breeds.

When the breed was originally introduced breeders called them Shetland Collies, which upset Rough Collie breeders, so the name was changed to Shetland Sheepdog. During the early 20th century (up until the 1940s), additional crosses were made to Rough Collies to help retain the desired Rough Collie type – in fact, the first English Shetland champion&#x27;s dam, Gesta, was a rough Collie. The year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the Shetland by the English Kennel Club, with the first registered Shetland being a female called Badenock Rose. The first Shetland to be registered by the American Kennel Club was &quot;Lord Scott&quot; in 1911.

==Appearance==

The general appearance of the Shetland is that of a miniature Rough Collie. They are a small and double coated dog with a well shaped head. They have a long coat which becomes short around the face giving it the appearance of a mane.

===Coat and colours===
Shetlands have a double coat, which means that they have two layers of fur that make up their coat. The outer coat is made up of long hair and is &quot;harsh-textured and straight&quot;. The undercoat is soft, short, and close to the skin. The long coat should produce the appearance of a mane. The face is smooth haired.

Shetlands may come in the following colours.
*Sable – either clear or shaded sable ranging in colour from pale gold to mahogany. Wolf-sable and grey are undesirable colours.
*Tricolor – with intense black on the body and rich tan markings preferred.
* Blue merle – silvery blue with splashed and marbled black preferred. General effect of the coat must be blue. Rich tan markings are also preferred but there is no penalty for the absence of this. Strong black markings, slate or rusty tinges in the coat are highly undesirable.
* Black and white &amp; black and tan

White markings may appear on any coat besides black and tan but patches on the body are undesirable.

===Height===

The ideal height at the withers is 14 inches (37 cms) for dogs and 14 inches (35.5 cm) for bitches. More than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in variation from these heights is undesirable.

===Ears===

The Shetland&#x27;s ears are small and of moderate width at the base placed close on top of the head. When alert the ears are semi-erect and propped forward.

===Eyes===

Eyes are of medium size and are almond shaped. Eyes are always dark brown except in dogs with merle coats where one or both of the eyes may be blue.

===Head===
The head is refined without any exaggerations. The head has a long wedge tapering from the ears to nose. The occipital bone isn&#x27;t prominent. The cheeks are flat to support a well roounded muzzle. The muzzle is of equal length to the skull, dividing at the corner of the eye. The mucocutaneous parts of the face are black in pigmentation.

===Body===
Neck is well arched and muscular. Legs are muscular. The dog is slightly longer than it is tall with a deep chest.

==Temperament==

According to Dr. Stanley Coren, an expert on animal intelligence, the Shetland Sheepdog is one of the brightest dogs, ranking 6th out of 138 breeds tested. His research found that an average Shetland could understand a new command in fewer than five repetitions and would obey a command the first time it was given 95% of the time or better.

==Health==

A Japanese study of pet cemetery data found a life expectancy of 14.3 years with 239 dogs—higher than 13.7 overall life expectancy. A UK study found a life expectancy of 13.4 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The Shetland is predisposed to the following dermatological conditions: allergic skin disease, cutaneous drug eruptions, cutaneous histiocytosis, cutaneous or systemic lupus, dermatomyositis, and Sertoli cell tumour.

Shetland Sheepdogs have four times the risk of other dogs of developing transitional cell carcinoma, a cancer of the bladder.

A North American study of over a million hip scores in dogs over the age of two found the Shetland to have the fifth-lowest prevalence out of sixty breeds—4.2% of Shetlands had hip dysplasia.

Von Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder. The Shetland is affected by both type I and type III. 

Collie eye anomaly is an autosomal recessive inherited trait which results in incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure, seen almost exclusively in Collies, Border Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs.

A mutation the MDR1 gene causes sensitivity to certain drugs such as ivermectin. This sensitivity has been observed in the Shetland. The MDR1 mutation has been identified in the Shetland and the breed was identified as predisposed in a study in the US. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including acepromazine, butorphanol, doxorubicin, erythromycin, ivermectin, loperamide, milbemycin, moxidectin, rifampin, selamectin, vinblastine, and vincristine.

Ulcerative dermatosis of Shetland sheepdog and rough collie (UDSSC) is a disease that is believed to be a vesicular variant of discoid lupus erythematosus. It is an ulcerative dermatosis that affects the thigh, groin, axillae, and ventral abdomen.

A UK study found a significant predisposition to gall bladder mucocele, with the breed being 93.87 times more likely to acquire the condition than other dogs. A study looking at the increased incidence of hepatobiliary disease in the Shetland Sheepdog found that an insertion mutation of the ABCB4 gene that occurs in the Shetland Sheepdog—as well as other breeds—had a significant association with gall bladder mucocele prevalence.

==Working life==
As the name suggests, Shetland Sheepdogs can and have been used as sheepdogs and still participate in sheepdog trials to this day. Herding dogs conduct livestock from one place to another by causing fear-flocking and flight behaviour.

===Activities===
In their size group, the breed dominates dog agility, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Shetlands exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

==Famous Shetland Sheepdogs==
* Ch Halstor&#x27;s Peter Pumpkin ROM – The Shetland sheepdog sire with the most Champions (160).
* Badenock Rose – the first Shetland sheepdog registered with the English Kennel Club.
*Mickey – main character of Canadian children&#x27;s series &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Farm&quot;

<doc id="177581" wikidata="Q714968" url="?curid=177581" title="Martin B-10">
<text>The Martin B-10 was the first all-metal monoplane bomber to be regularly used by the United States Army Air Corps, having entered service in June 1934. It was also the first mass-produced bomber whose performance was superior to that of the Army&#x27;s pursuit aircraft of the time.

The B-10 served as the airframe for the B-12, B-13, B-14, A-15 and O-45 designations using Pratt &amp; Whitney engines instead of Wright Cyclones.
A total of 348 of all versions were built. The largest users were the US, with 166, and the Netherlands, with 121.

==Design and development==

The B-10 began a revolution in bomber design. Its all-metal monoplane airframe, along with its features of closed cockpits, rotating gun turrets (almost simultaneously with the 1933 British Boulton &amp; Paul Overstrand biplane bomber&#x27;s own enclosed nose-turret), retractable landing gear, internal bomb bay, and full engine cowlings, became the standard for bomber designs worldwide for decades. It made all existing bombers completely obsolete. Martin received the 1932 Collier Trophy for designing the XB-10.

The B-10 began as the Martin Model 123, a private venture by the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore, Maryland. It had a crew of four: pilot, copilot, nose gunner and fuselage gunner. As in previous bombers, the four crew compartments were open, but it had a number of design innovations as well.

These innovations included a deep belly for an internal bomb bay and retractable main landing gear. Its Wright SR-1820-E Cyclone engines provided sufficient power. The Model 123 first flew on 16 February 1932 and was delivered for testing to the U.S. Army on 20 March as the XB-907. After testing it was sent back to Martin for redesigning and was rebuilt as the XB-10.

The XB-10 delivered to the Army had major differences from the original aircraft. Where the Model 123 had Townend rings, the XB-10 had full NACA cowlings to decrease drag. It also sported a pair of Wright R-1820-19 engines, and an increase in the wingspan, along with an enclosed nose turret. When the XB-10 flew during trials in June, it recorded a speed of at . This was an impressive performance for 1932.

Following the success of the XB-10, a number of changes were made, including reduction to a three-man crew and addition of canopies for all crew positions. The Army ordered 48 of these on 17 January 1933. The first 14 aircraft were designated YB-10 and delivered to Wright Field, starting in November 1933, and used in the Army Air Corps Mail Operation. The production model of the XB-10, the YB-10, was very similar to its prototype.

==Operational history==
===United States===

In 1935, the Army ordered an additional 103 aircraft designated B-10B. These had only minor changes from the YB-10. Shipments began in July 1935. B-10Bs served with the 2d Bomb Group at Langley Field, the 9th Bomb Group at Mitchel Field, the 19th Bomb Group at March Field, the 6th Composite Group in the Panama Canal Zone, and the 4th Composite Group in the Philippines. In addition to conventional duties in the bomber role, some modified YB-10s and B-12As were operated for a time on large twin floats for coastal patrol.

In February 1936, the US Army Air Corps used 13 B-10Bs of the 49th Bomb Squadron to drop supplies to the residents of Virginia&#x27;s Tangier Island and Maryland&#x27;s Smith Island; with ships unable to reach the islands due to heavy ice in the Chesapeake Bay, the islanders faced starvation after a severe winter storm. The B-10B supply flights followed earlier supply flights to the islands by the Goodyear Blimp &quot;Enterprise&quot; on 2 February 1936 and by the squadron&#x27;s Keystone B-6A bombers on 9 and 10 February 1936.

With its advanced performance, the Martin company fully expected that export orders for the B-10 would flood in. The U.S. Army owned the rights to the Model 139 design. Once the Army&#x27;s orders had been filled in 1936, Martin received permission to export Model 139s, and delivered versions to several air forces. These included six Model 139Ws sold to Siam in April 1937, powered by Wright R-1820-G3 Cyclone engines, and 20 Model 139Ws sold to Turkey in September 1937, powered by R-1820-G2 engines.

===China===

ROCAF purchased the 139WC in 1936, When introduced, it was the fastest aircraft in China.

The 139WC was primarily used for night bombing and maritime reconnaissance.

On 25 August 1937, as the air battles intensified in the early part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, five Chinese Nationalist Air Force bombers of the 8th BG, 19th and 30th Squadrons consisting of three Heinkel He 111As and two Martin B-10s, flying from their base in Nanjing to Shanghai, successfully dropped their bombs on Japanese landing forces at Liuhe, Taicang, northwest of Shanghai. However, Japanese aircraft pursued the bombers and shot up two of the Heinkels, forcing them to crash land; two crew members were killed on the ground by Japanese aircraft strafing them.
As the National Revolutionary Army of China fought desperately to hold onto their remaining positions in the Battle of Shanghai, the Chinese Air Force launched a major strike with a motley mix of aircraft against Japanese positions in Shanghai on 14 October 1937, consisting of three B-10s, two Heinkel He 111As, five Douglas O-2MCs, five Northrop Gammas, and three Curtiss Hawk IIIs from Nanjing in the late afternoon; in the evening, one bomber was launched every hour from Nanjing to attack Japanese positions in Shanghai until 03:00 on 15 October.

On 19 May 1938, two B-10s of the 2nd BG, 14th Squadron, led by Capt. Hsu Huan-sheng and Lt. Teng Yen-bo, successfully flew the first air raid on mainland Japan; the unescorted nighttime raid over Japan saw the B-10s dropped 2 million leaflets in &quot;alerting the conscience of the Japanese people against atrocities committed by the Japanese invasion and occupation of China&quot;, over the cities of Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Kurume, Saga, and others, while reconnoitering airbases, ports, warships and factories.

===Dutch East Indies===
In the mid-1930s, the Netherlands government adopted a doctrine for defense of the Netherlands East Indies, which relied on the use of land-based bombers against any attacking force, with orders for defensive fighters cancelled to pay for the bomber force. The Martin 139 was chosen in preference to the Dutch Fokker T.V, as its all metal construction was considered more robust than the steel tube and fabric Fokker, while the Martin bomber was also already in production and therefore would be available sooner. Twelve Martin 139 WH-1s were ordered for the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (ML-KNIL) in 1936, followed by 26 improved WH-2s in March 1937, sufficient bombers to equip a Group of three squadrons. In December 1937, an order was placed for 39 Martin 139 WH-3s, followed by an order for 40 Martin 139 WH-3As in November 1938. Two more Martin 139 WH-3As were ordered in July 1939 to replace aircraft lost during delivery. The last of these attrition replacement aircraft was delivered in March 1940, including the last Martin B-10/139 built. On the outbreak of war with Japan in December 1941, about 58 Martins (WH-3 and WH-3As) were operational with six squadrons, with about 20 more of the older variants in reserve. B-10s of the ML-KNIL served in the defense of the Dutch East Indies.

During the start of Pacific War, Dutch Martin units were as follows:
*&quot;Ie Vliegtuiggroep&quot; (VLG-I) based on Andir Airfield, Bandoeng which consisted of &quot;1e Afdeling&quot; (1-VLG-I) and &quot;2e Afdeling&quot; (2-VLG-I), each has nine Martin 139WH-3/3A with additional two aircraft as reserve. Each &quot;afdeling&quot; has a detachment during the war, with the &quot;Patrouille&quot; Butner of 1-VLG-I stationed at Tarakan and &quot;Patrouille&quot; Cooke of 2-VLG-I stationed at Samarinda II Airfield, Melak.
*&quot;IIe Vliegtuiggroep&quot; (VLG-II) based on Singosari Airfield, Malang which consisted of &quot;1e Afdeling&quot; (1-VLG-II) with nine WH-3/3A with three additional reserves and three WH-2. During the war, four &quot;patrouille&quot; consisted of three aircraft plus a reserve were created from 1-VLG-II, with the crews mobilized from Kalidjati flight school.
*&quot;IIIe Vliegtuiggroep&quot; (VLG-III) based on Tjililitan Airfield, Batavia which consisted of &quot;1e Afdeling&quot; (1-VLG-III) and &quot;3e Afdeling&quot; (3-VLG-III), each equipped with nine WH-3/3A with two additional reserves, and &quot;2e Afdeling&quot; (2-VLG-III) with nine WH-2 with two additional reserves. &quot;7e Afdeling Bommenwerpers&quot;, a reserve unit mobilized on 15 December 1941, were placed under VLG-III and consisted of one WH-2, two WH-3 and six WH-3A.
In efforts to reinforce the British defense of the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies sent some ML-KNIL squadrons. Included were 22 Martin 139s from VLG-III that were organized into three squadrons, which arrived at Singapore on 9 December 1941. Due to a lack of coordination, British AA mistook the Dutch Martins for enemy aircraft and engaged them as they neared Singapore. The Martins were then stationed at Sembawang. In early January 1942, Dutch Martins along with British Blenheim bombers sortied over the west coast of Malaya to halt the Japanese advance. On 8 January, nine Martin and four Australian Hudson attacked a suspected Japanese seaplane tender anchored offshore in South China Sea, but the results were inconclusive. In the next day, nine Martin &quot;quite successfully&quot; bombed several Japanese ships unloading cargo at Kuantan. Two Martins were shot down by the Japanese near Penang on 1 January, while a further four Martins were lost while attacking Japanese forces on the Muar River on 19 January. On the same day, Dutch fighter squadrons were withdrawn to Sumatra, while the Martins were also withdrawn to Java three days later.

===Thailand===
Six B-10s formed the medium bomber force of the Royal Thai Air Force at the start of the 1940–1941 Franco-Thai War. They flew several bombing missions during the war, with their first mission against Xieng Khuang, Laos and a nearby airfield on 15 December 1940, with the last mission, against Sisophon in what is now Cambodia on 28 January at the very end of the Franco-Thai War. Later on, B-10s had been assigned to the airfield in Phrae as a part of Phayap Army to invade Shan state.

=== Turkey ===
After being delivered in September 1937, the Martin 139WTs were assigned to the 55th and 56th Tayyare Bölüğü (Aviation Squadrons) of the 9th Tayyare Taburu (Aviation Battalion). During the Second World War, the aircraft were extensively deployed for surveillance over the Black Sea. After being replaced by British Blenheims and Beauforts in 1944, the Martin 139WTs served as backup aircraft until 1946, when twelve of the sixteen remaining aircraft were still operational.

==Legacy==
At the time of its creation, the B-10B was so advanced that General Henry H. Arnold described it as the airpower wonder of its day. It was half again as fast as any biplane bomber, and faster than any contemporary fighter. The B-10 began a revolution in bomber design, making existing bombers completely obsolete.

Rapid advances in bomber design in the late 1930s meant that the B-10 was eclipsed by the time the United States entered World War II. The Model 139s in combat in China and South East Asia suffered the same disadvantages as the other early war medium bombers, i.e. not enough armor and guns, while it could not outrun the latest fighters.

An abortive effort to modernize the design, the Martin Model 146, was entered into a USAAC long-distance bomber design competition in 1934–5. The bomber came in a strong second place and was bested by only the Boeing B-17 in range and endurance. However, it had a higher ceiling of , was only slower, and carried less in bombs than the Boeing, at over half the cost. Nonetheless, the design was seen as a dead end, and the third-place contender, the Douglas B-18, was selected instead.

==Surviving aircraft==
*The only surviving complete example is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. The aircraft is painted as a B-10 used in the 1934 Alaskan Flight but was a Martin 139WAA export version sold to Argentina in 1938. The aircraft was restored by the 96th Maintenance Squadron (Mobile), Air Force Reserve, at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, in 1973–1976, and placed on display in 1976.
*The wreck of a crashed Dutch Martin 166WH-3 in East Kalimantan, Indonesia was rediscovered during an expedition by local newspaper &quot;Berau Post&quot; in early August 2018, based on local villagers&#x27; story of a crashed aircraft on top of a mountain. The wreck is located on Gunung Besar, Long Keluh Village, Kelay District, Berau Regency. Large parts of the wreck, such as the two engines, mid and rear fuselage, tail and elevators, and the right wing are still extant at the time of the expedition. According to a local villager, parts of the wreck have been looted by locals for decades. The aircraft&#x27;s number, &quot;M-574&quot;, was still visible amidst the moss in the wreck. The &quot;M-574&quot; was reported missing during a mission over southeast Dutch Borneo on 5 January 1941.
*Various parts of crashed B-10s, such as turrets and wings, were retrieved from the jungle of Borneo and were on display in the Militaire Luchtvaart Museum (Military Aviation Museum) at Soesterberg, the Netherlands. Since the closure of the MLM, they are stored with the Nationaal Militair Museum, located on the former Soesterberg Air Base.

<doc id="177582" wikidata="Q236594" url="?curid=177582" title="Sextus Empiricus">
<text>Sextus Empiricus (, ; ) was a Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher and Empiric school physician with Roman citizenship. His philosophical works are the most complete surviving account of ancient Greek and Roman Pyrrhonism, and because of the arguments they contain against the other Hellenistic philosophies, they are also a major source of information about those philosophies.

== Life ==
Little is known about Sextus Empiricus. He likely lived in Alexandria, Rome, or Athens. His Roman name, Sextus, implies he was a Roman citizen. The &quot;Suda,&quot; a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, states that he was the same person as Sextus of Chaeronea, as do other pre-modern sources, but this identification is commonly doubted. In his medical work, as reflected by his name, tradition maintains that he belonged to the Empiric school in which Pyrrhonism was popular. However, at least twice in his writings, Sextus seems to place himself closer to the Methodic school.

== Philosophy ==

As a skeptic, Sextus Empiricus raised concerns which applied to all types of knowledge. He doubted the validity of induction long before its best known critic David Hume, and raised the regress argument against all forms of reasoning:

This view is known as Pyrrhonian skepticism, which Sextus differentiated from Academic skepticism as practiced by Carneades which, according to Sextus, denies the possibility of knowledge altogether, something that Sextus criticized as being an affirmative belief. Instead, Sextus advocates simply giving up belief; in other words, suspending judgment (epoché) about whether or not anything is knowable. Only by suspending judgment can we attain a state of ataraxia (roughly, &#x27;peace of mind&#x27;).

There is some debate as to the extent to which Sextus advocated the suspension of judgement. According to Myles Burnyeat, Jonathan Barnes, and Benson Mates, Sextus advises that we should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs; that is to say, we should neither affirm any belief as true nor deny any belief as false, since we may live without any beliefs, acting by habit. Michael Frede, however, defends a different interpretation, according to which Sextus does allow beliefs, so long as they are not derived by reason, philosophy or speculation; a skeptic may, for example, accept common opinions in the skeptic&#x27;s society. The important difference between the skeptic and the dogmatist is that the skeptic does not hold his beliefs &quot;as a result of rigorous philosophical investigation.&quot;

== Writings ==
Diogenes Laërtius and the Suda report that Sextus Empiricus wrote ten books on Pyrrhonism. The Suda also says Sextus wrote a book &quot;Ethica&quot;. Sextus Empiricus&#x27;s three surviving works are the &quot;Outlines of Pyrrhonism&quot; (, &quot;Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis&quot;, thus commonly abbreviated &quot;PH&quot;), and two distinct works preserved under the same title, &quot;Adversus Mathematicos&quot; (, &quot;Pros mathematikous&quot;, commonly abbreviated &quot;AM&quot; or &quot;M&quot; and known as &quot;Against Those in the Disciplines,&quot; or &quot;Against the Mathematicians&quot;). &quot;Adversus Mathematicos&quot; is incomplete as the text references parts that are not in the surviving text. &quot;Adversus Mathematicos&quot; also includes mentions of three other works which did not survive: 
* &quot;Medical Commentaries&quot; (AD I 202) 
* &quot;Empirical Commentaries&quot; (AM I 62)
* &quot;Commentaries on the Soul&quot; which includes a discussion of the Pythagoreans&#x27; metaphysical theory of numbers (AD IV 284) and shows that the soul is nothing (AM VI 55)

The surviving first six books of &quot;Adversus Mathematicos&quot; are commonly known as &quot;Against the Professors&quot;. Each book also has a traditional title; although none of these titles except &quot;Pros mathematikous&quot; and &quot;Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis&quot; are found in the manuscripts. 
&quot;Adversus Mathematicos&quot; &quot;I–VI&quot; is sometimes distinguished from &quot;Adversus Mathematicos&quot; &quot;VII–XI&quot; by using another title, &quot;Against the Dogmatists&quot; (, &quot;Pros dogmatikous&quot;) and then the remaining books are numbered as I–II, III–IV, and V, despite the fact that it is commonly inferred that what we have is just part of a larger work whose beginning is missing and it is unknown how much of the total work has been lost. The supposed general title of this partially lost work is &quot;Skeptical Treatises&quot;&#x27; (/&quot;Skeptika Hypomnēmata&quot;).

== Legacy ==
An influential Latin translation of Sextus&#x27;s &quot;Outlines&quot; was published by Henricus Stephanus in Geneva in 1562, and this was followed by a complete Latin Sextus with Gentian Hervet as translator in 1569. Petrus and Jacobus Chouet published the Greek text for the first time in 1621. Stephanus did not publish it with his Latin translation either in 1562 or in 1569, nor was it published in the reprint of the latter in 1619.

Sextus&#x27;s &quot;Outlines&quot; were widely read in Europe during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and had a profound effect on Michel de Montaigne, David Hume and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, among many others. Another source for the circulation of Sextus&#x27;s ideas was Pierre Bayle&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;. The legacy of Pyrrhonism is described in Richard Popkin&#x27;s &quot;The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes&quot; and &quot;High Road to Pyrrhonism&quot;. The transmission of Sextus&#x27;s manuscripts through antiquity and the Middle Ages is reconstructed by Luciano Floridi&#x27;s &quot;Sextus Empiricus, The Recovery and Transmission of Pyrrhonism&quot; (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). Since the Renaissance, French philosophy has been continuously influenced by Sextus: Montaigne in the 16th century, Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Pierre-Daniel Huet and François de La Mothe Le Vayer in the 17th century, many of the &quot;Philosophes&quot;, and in recent times controversial figures such as Michel Onfray, in a direct line of filiation between Sextus&#x27; radical skepticism and secular or even radical atheism.

<text>Shirley Vivian Teresa Brittain Williams, Baroness Williams of Crosby, (&quot;née&quot; Catlin; 27 July 1930 – 12 April 2021) was a British politician and academic. Originally a Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), she served in the Labour cabinet from 1974 to 1979. She was one of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; rebels who founded the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981 and, at the time of her retirement from politics, was a Liberal Democrat.

Williams was elected to the House of Commons for Hitchin in the 1964 general election. She served as minister for Education and Science from 1967 to 1969 and Minister of State for Home Affairs from 1969 to 1970. She served as Shadow Home Secretary from 1971 and 1973. In 1974, she became Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection in Harold Wilson&#x27;s cabinet. When Wilson was succeeded by James Callaghan, she served as Secretary of State for Education and Science and Paymaster General from 1976 to 1979. She lost her seat to the Conservative Party at the 1979 general election.

In 1981, dismayed with the Labour Party&#x27;s left-ward movement under Michael Foot, she was one of the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;—centrist Labour figures who formed the SDP. Williams won the 1981 Crosby by-election and became the first SDP member elected to Parliament, but she lost the seat in the 1983 general election. She served as President of the SDP from 1982 to 1987 and supported the SDP&#x27;s merger with the Liberal Party that formed the Liberal Democrats.

Between 2001 and 2004, she served as Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords and, from 2007 to 2010, as Adviser on Nuclear Proliferation to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. She remained an active member of the House of Lords until announcing her retirement in January 2016, and was a Professor Emerita of Electoral Politics at Harvard Kennedy School at the time of her death at age 90, having been one of the last surviving members of the Labour governments of the 1970s.

== Early life and education ==
Born at 19 Glebe Place Chelsea, London, Williams was the daughter of the political scientist and philosopher Sir George Catlin and the pacifist writer Vera Brittain. Williams&#x27;s grandmother, Brittain&#x27;s mother, was born in Aberystwyth, Wales. She was educated at various schools, including Mrs Spencer&#x27;s School in Brechin Place, South Kensington; Christchurch Elementary School in Chelsea; Talbot Heath School in Bournemouth; and St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in London. During the Second World War, from 1940 to 1943, she was evacuated to St. Paul, Minnesota, in the United States, where she attended the all-girls&#x27; Summit School. 

While she was an undergraduate and an Open Scholar at Somerville College, Oxford, Williams was a member of the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS) and toured the United States playing the role of Cordelia in an OUDS production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; directed by a young Tony Richardson. In 1950, she became chair of the Oxford University Labour Club, believing herself to be the first woman to hold the position though it has been shown that Betty Tate had chaired a session in 1934. After graduating as a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy, politics and economics, Williams was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship and studied American trade unionism at Columbia University in New York City for a master&#x27;s degree, awarded by Oxford in 1954.

On returning to Britain, she began her career as a journalist, working firstly for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and then for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. In 1960, she became General Secretary of the Fabian Society, a role she held until 1964.

== Parliamentary career ==
After unsuccessfully contesting the constituency of Harwich at the 1954 by-election and the general election the following year, as well as the constituency of Southampton Test at the 1959 general election, Williams was elected in the 1964 general election as Labour MP for the constituency of Hitchin in Hertfordshire. She retained the seat, renamed Hertford and Stevenage after boundary changes in 1974, until 1979. As Minister for Education and Science (August 1967 – October 1969), Williams launched the first &quot;Women in Engineering Year&quot; in 1969.

Her colleague David Owen recalled: &quot;You&#x27;d watch her work a room at a local Labour event and she&#x27;d never start by smarming up to a regional leader or a councillor. She&#x27;d settle down next to somebody whom she&#x27;d have no political reason to talk to – a solid party worker – and you&#x27;d watch this person&#x27;s face light up. This was always done spontaneously, without any ulterior motives. She just liked people and liked them to like her.&quot;

Between 1971 and 1973, she served as Shadow Home Secretary. In 1974, she became Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection in Harold Wilson&#x27;s cabinet. When Wilson announced his resignation in 1976 and was succeeded by James Callaghan, she became Secretary of State for Education and Paymaster General, holding both cabinet positions at the same time. Williams stood for the Labour deputy leadership in October of that year but lost to Michael Foot.

=== Comprehensive schools ===
While serving as education secretary between 1976 and 1979, Williams pursued the policy introduced by Anthony Crosland in 1965 to introduce the comprehensive school system in place of grammar schools. Previously, in 1972, as her daughter Rebecca approached secondary school age, Williams had moved into the catchment area of the voluntary aided school Godolphin and Latymer School allowing her daughter to gain a place there. However, when Godolphin and Latymer School subsequently voted to go independent in 1977, Rebecca chose to leave that school and instead went to Camden School for Girls because it had chosen to go comprehensive.

=== Europeanism ===
Always a passionately committed supporter of European integration, Williams was one of 68 Labour MPs to defy a three-line whip in the 28 October 1971 Commons vote on membership of the European Communities. Four years later, she was one of the leaders of the Britain in Europe campaign during the 1975 European Communities membership referendum. Labour&#x27;s anti-Europeanism during the Michael Foot years was one of the factors that drove her to abandon the party in 1981.

In her 2016 valedictory speech to the House of Lords before that year&#x27;s second membership referendum, she described the UK&#x27;s European Union (EU) membership as &quot;the most central political question that this country has to answer&quot; and said it was the reason for her retirement. In closing, she called on her colleagues to &quot;think very hard before allowing the United Kingdom to withdraw from ... its major duty to the world—the one it will encounter, and then deliver, through the European Union&quot;.

=== Social issues ===
A lifelong Roman Catholic, Williams was a longstanding opponent of the legalisation of abortion. She was one of the two female MPs to vote against the Abortion Act 1967, which legalised abortion. However, Lord Harries of Pentregarth reported that Williams &quot;refused to sign up for the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC), and generally kept a low profile on the issue of abortion.&quot;

Thursday, 21 June, 2007 She appeared on Question Time (TV programme) to discuss Salman Rushdie being honoured. She was strongly opposed to the action.

== Social Democratic Party ==
Williams lost her seat (renamed Hertford and Stevenage) when the Labour Party was defeated at the 1979 general election. Her defeat came two years after her appearance and arrest on the Grunwick picket lines, for which she had been harshly criticised in the press. When, soon afterward, she was interviewed by Robin Day for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Decision 79&quot; television coverage of the election results, both Norman St John-Stevas – the Conservative&#x27;s Education Spokesman who had frequently clashed with her at the despatch box – and Merlyn Rees, the outgoing Home Secretary, paid tribute to her.

Following the election, she hosted the BBC1 TV series &quot;Shirley Williams in Conversation&quot;, interviewing, in turn, a number of political figures, including former West German chancellor Willy Brandt, former Conservative prime minister Edward Heath and her recently deposed colleague James Callaghan. She later appeared on many television and radio discussion programmes in Britain – in particular, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot;, where her 58 appearances earned her a &quot;Most Frequent Panellist&quot; award. During this period, Williams remained a member of the National Executive of the Labour Party. From 1980 to 1981, she was Chairman of the Fabian Society.

In 1981, unhappy with the influence of the more left-wing members of the Labour Party, she resigned her membership to form – along with fellow Labour resignees Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Bill Rodgers – the Social Democratic Party (SDP). They were joined by 28 other Labour MPs and one Conservative. Later that year, following the death of the Conservative MP Sir Graham Page, she won the Crosby by-election and became the first SDP member elected to Parliament. Two years later, however, having become the SDP&#x27;s President, she lost the seat at the 1983 general election. At the 1987 general election, Williams stood for the SDP in Cambridge, but lost to the sitting Conservative candidate Robert Rhodes James. She then supported the SDP&#x27;s merger with the Liberal Party that formed the Liberal Democrats.

== Harvard University ==
In 1988, Williams moved to the United States to serve as a professor at Harvard Kennedy School, remaining until 2001, and thereafter as Public Service Professor of Electoral Politics, Emerita. Nonetheless, she remained active in politics and public service in Britain, the United States and internationally. During these years, Williams helped draft constitutions in Russia, Ukraine, and South Africa. She also served as director of Harvard&#x27;s &quot;Project Liberty&quot;, an initiative designed to assist the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe; and as a board member and acting director of Harvard&#x27;s Institute of Politics (IOP). Upon her elevation to the House of Lords in 1993, she returned to the United Kingdom.

== Life peer ==
Williams was made a life peer on 1 February 1993, as Baroness Williams of Crosby, of Stevenage in the County of Hertfordshire, and subsequently served as Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords from 2001 to 2004.

Among other non-profit boards, Williams was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the EU&#x27;s &quot;Comité des Sages&quot; (Reflection Group) on Social Policy, the Twentieth Century Fund, the Ditchley Foundation, the Institute for Public Policy Research, and the Nuclear Threat Initiative. She also served as President of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, as Commissioner of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament and as president of the Cambridge University Liberal Association. Williams was also an attendee of the 2013 and the 2010 Bilderberg conferences in Watford, Hertfordshire, England, and Sitges, Spain, respectively.

In June 2007, after Gordon Brown replaced Tony Blair as Prime Minister, Williams accepted a formal Government position as Advisor on Nuclear Proliferation provided she could serve as an independent advisor; she remained a Liberal Democrat. Her interest and commitment to education continued, and she served as Chair of Judges of the British Teaching Awards. Williams was a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009.

Williams was originally opposed to the Cameron–Clegg coalition&#x27;s Health and Social Care Bill, describing it as &quot;stealth privatisation&quot; during 2011. The government made some changes to the Bill, described by Williams as &quot;major concessions&quot;, but dismissed as &quot;minor&quot; by &quot;Guardian&quot; commentator Polly Toynbee. Williams urged Liberal Democrats to support the amended Bill during the conference in March 2012, saying &quot;I would not have stuck with the bill, if I believed for one moment it would undermine the NHS.&quot;

Williams spoke against same-sex marriage in the House of Lords, saying that &quot;equality is not the same as sameness. That is the fundamental mistake in this Bill&quot; and that women and men &quot;complement one another&quot;, arguing that marriage between people of the same sex should not be called marriage but should have &quot;different nomenclature&quot;. This was based on her belief that marriage is &quot;a framework for procreation and the raising of children.&quot; In late 2015, she announced her intention to retire from the House of Lords. On 28 January 2016 she made her valedictory speech in the chamber, and on 11 February she officially retired, in pursuance of Section 1 of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014. In the 2017 New Year Honours, Williams was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour for &quot;services to political and public life&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Williams married twice. At Oxford she met Peter Parker (the future head of British Rail) and they had a relationship. In her autobiography (&quot;Climbing the Bookshelves&quot;) Williams said that &quot;...by the spring of 1949 I was in love with him, and he, a little, with me...&quot;. In 1955, she married the moral philosopher Bernard Williams. Bernard left Oxford to accommodate his wife&#x27;s rising political ambitions, finding a post first at University College London (1959–64) and then as Professor of Philosophy at Bedford College, London (1964–67), while she worked as a journalist for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and as Secretary of the Fabian Society. The marriage was dissolved in 1974; Bernard Williams subsequently married Patricia Skinner and had two sons with her. Shirley said of her marriage to Bernard:

... [T]here was something of a strain that comes from two things. One is that we were both too caught up in what we were respectively doing — we didn&#x27;t spend all that much time together; the other, to be completely honest, is that I&#x27;m fairly unjudgmental and I found Bernard&#x27;s capacity for pretty sharp putting-down of people he thought were stupid unacceptable. Patricia has been cleverer than me in that respect. She just rides it. He can be very painful sometimes. He can eviscerate somebody. Those who are left behind are, as it were, dead personalities. Judge not that ye be not judged. I was influenced by Christian thinking, and he would say &quot;That&#x27;s frightfully pompous and it&#x27;s not really the point.&quot; So we had a certain jarring over that and over Catholicism.

Her first marriage was annulled in 1980. In 1987 she married the Harvard professor and presidential historian Richard Neustadt, who died in 2003.

She had a daughter with Bernard Williams, a stepdaughter, and two grandchildren. Her daughter, Rebecca, became a lawyer. She was a longtime resident of Hertfordshire, living in Furneux Pelham after she was elected MP for Hitchin, and moving to Little Hadham later in life.

Williams was a Roman Catholic and, from 2009, attended church every Sunday. In &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, she listed her recreations as &quot;music, poetry, hill walking&quot;.

She died at her home in the early hours of 12 April 2021, at the age of 90. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey called Williams a &quot;Liberal lion and a true trailblazer&quot; and stated that &quot;political life will be poorer without her intellect, her wisdom and her generosity&quot;.

== Honours ==
Williams was made an Honorary Fellow of her alma mater, Somerville College, Oxford, in 1970, and of Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1977. Williams received a number of honorary doctorates:

<doc id="177589" wikidata="Q57281" url="?curid=177589" title="August Wilhelm Schlegel">
<text>August Wilhelm von Schlegel (Schlegel until 1812; ; ; 8 September 176712 May 1845) was a German Indologist, poet, translator and critic. With his brother Friedrich Schlegel, he was a leading influence within Jena Romanticism. His translations of Shakespeare turned the English dramatist&#x27;s works into German classics. Schlegel was also the professor of Sanskrit in Continental Europe and produced a translation of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;.

==Childhood and education==
Schlegel was born in Hanover, where his father, Johann Adolf Schlegel, was a Lutheran pastor. He was educated at the Hanover gymnasium and at the University of Göttingen. Initially studying theology, he received a thorough philological training under Heyne and became an admirer and friend of Bürger, with whom he was engaged in an ardent study of Dante Alighieri, Petrarch and William Shakespeare. Schlegel met with Caroline Schelling and Wilhelm von Humboldt. In 1790 his brother Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel came to Göttingen. Both were influenced by Johann Gottfried Herder, Immanuel Kant, Tiberius Hemsterhuis, Johann Winckelmann and Karl Theodor von Dalberg. From 1791 to 1795, Schlegel was tutor to Willem Ferdinand Mogge Muilman, the son of a Dutch banker, who lived at Herengracht 476 in Amsterdam.

==Career==
In 1796, soon after his return to Germany, Schlegel settled in Jena, following an invitation from Friedrich Schiller. That year he married Caroline Schelling, the widow of the physician Böhmer. She assisted Schlegel in some of his literary productions, and the publication of her correspondence in 1871 established for her a posthumous reputation as a German letter writer. She separated from Schlegel in 1801 and became the wife of the philosopher Schelling soon after.
In Jena, Schlegel made critical contributions to Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Horen&quot; and that author&#x27;s &quot;Musen-Almanach&quot;, and wrote around 300 articles for the &quot;Jenaer Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung&quot;. He also did translations from Dante and Shakespeare. This work established his literary reputation and gained for him in 1798 an extraordinary professorship at the University of Jena. His house became the intellectual headquarters of the &quot;romanticists&quot;, and was visited at various times between 1796 and 1801 by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, whose &quot;Foundations of the Science of Knowledge&quot; was studied intensively, by his brother Friedrich, who moved in with his wife Dorothea Schlegel, by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, by Ludwig Tieck, by Novalis and others.

In 1797 August and Friedrich broke with Friedrich Schiller. With his brother, Schlegel founded the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; (1798–1800), the organ of the Romantic school, in which he dissected disapprovingly the immensely popular works of the sentimental novelist August Lafontaine. He also published a volume of poems and carried on a controversy with Kotzebue. At this time the two brothers were remarkable for the vigour and freshness of their ideas and commanded respect as the leaders of the new Romantic criticism. A volume of their joint essays appeared in 1801 under the title &quot;Charakteristiken und Kritiken&quot;. His play &quot;Ion&quot;, performed in Weimar in January 1802, was supported by Goethe, but became a failure.

In 1801 Schlegel went to Berlin, where he delivered lectures on art and literature; and in the following year he published &quot;Ion&quot;, a tragedy in Euripidean style, which gave rise to a suggestive discussion on the principles of dramatic poetry. This was followed by &quot;Spanisches Theater&quot; (2 vols, 1803/1809), in which he presented admirable translations of five of Calderón&#x27;s plays. In another volume, &quot;Blumensträusse italienischer, spanischer und portugiesischer Poesie&quot; (1804), he gave translations of Spanish, Portuguese and Italian lyrics. He also translated works by Dante Aligheri and Luís de Camões.

==Tutoring==
Early in 1804, he made the acquaintance of Madame de Staël in Berlin, who hired him as a tutor for her children. After divorcing his wife Caroline, Schlegel travelled with Madame de Staël to Switzerland, Italy and France, acting as an adviser in her literary work. In 1807 he attracted much attention in France by an essay in the French, &quot;Comparaison entre la Phèdre de Racine et celle d&#x27;Euripide&quot;, in which he attacked French classicism from the standpoint of the Romantic school. His famous lectures on dramatic art and literature (&quot;Über dramatische Kunst und Literatur&quot;, 1809–1811), which have been translated into most European languages, were delivered at Vienna in 1808. He was accompanied by De Staël and her children. In 1810 Schlegel was ordered to leave the Swiss Confederation as an enemy of the French literature.

In 1812, he travelled with De Staël, her fiancé Albert de Rocca and her children to Moscow, St. Petersburg and Stockholm and acted as secretary of Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, through whose influence the right of his family to noble rank was revived. After this, he joined again the household of Mme. de Staël until her death in 1817, for like Mathieu de Montmorency he was one of her intimates until the end of her life. Schlegel was made a professor of Indology at the University of Bonn in 1818, and during the remainder of his life occupied himself chiefly with oriental studies. He founded a special printing office for Sanskrit. As an orientalist, he was unable to adapt himself to the new methods opened up by Bopp. He corresponded with Wilhelm von Humboldt, a linguist. After the death of Madame de Staël 14 July 1817, Schlegel married in 1818 a daughter of Heinrich Paulus, but this union was dissolved in 1821.

==Travel and publications==
Schlegel was 50 years old and his own master. He was financially independent and could travel at his own expense. Schlegel&#x27;s Vienna Lectures had been published and were read across Europe and in Saint Petersburg. Therefore, he could cultivate friendships with the educated elite. He continued to lecture on art and literature, publishing in 1827 &quot;On the Theory and History of the Plastic Arts&quot;, and in 1828 two volumes of critical writings (&quot;Kritische Schriften&quot;).

Schlegel&#x27;s translation of William Shakespeare, begun in Jena, was ultimately completed, under the superintendence of Ludwig Tieck, Dorothea Tieck, and Wolf Heinrich Graf von Baudissin. This rendering is considered one of the best poetical translations in German.

Schlegel did find the time to pursue his fascination for India. He buried his head in Sanskrit. From 1823 til 1830 he published the journal &quot;Indische Bibliothek&quot;. In 1823 edited the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, with a Latin translation, and in 1829, the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. This was followed by his 1832 work &quot;Reflections on the Study of the Asiatic Languages&quot;.

Schlegel became convinced that the origin of Germanic people could be identified in linguistic evidence. He also believed that languages could be used to reconstruct patterns of human migration. So he studied the epics of Persia and India. Schlegel published on this matter, attesting Indians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Aztecs the benefit of progress. He was impressed with their architecture, their mathematics, and their technology. In 1837 he wrote the preface to the German translation of James Cowles Prichard&#x27;s book &quot;An Analysis of the Egyptian Mythology&quot; which originally had been published in 1819.

In 1835, Schlegel became head of the committee organising a monument in memory of Ludwig van Beethoven in Bonn, the composer&#x27;s birthplace. Schlegel died in Bonn in 1845, three months before its official unveiling.

===Translations by Schlegel===
Schlegel&#x27;s Shakespeare translations have been often reprinted. The edition of 1871–72 was revised with Schlegel&#x27;s manuscripts by Michael Bernays. See Bernays&#x27;s &quot;Zur Entstehungsgeschichte des Schlegelschen Shakespeare&quot; (1872); Rudolph Genée, &quot;Schlegel und Shakespeare&quot; (1903). Schlegel also translated plays by Pedro Calderón de la Barca, such as &quot;La banda y flor&quot;, which became the basis for E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s 1807 singspiel &quot;Liebe und Eifersucht&quot;.

A selection of the writings of both August Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel, edited by Oskar Walzel, will be found in Kürschner&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Nationalliteratur&quot;, 143 (1892).

<text>Caroline Schelling, born Michaelis, widowed Böhmer, divorced Schlegel (2 September 1763 – 7 September 1809), was a German intellectual. She was one of the so-called &quot;Universitätsmamsellen&quot;, a group of five academically active women during the 18th and 19th centuries, daughters of academics at Göttingen University, alongside Meta Forkel-Liebeskind, Therese Huber, Philippine Engelhard, and Dorothea Schlözer.

==Biography==
Schelling was born at Göttingen in 1763, the daughter of orientalist Johann David Michaelis (1717–1791), who taught at the progressive University of Göttingen. She was educated by private tutors and by her father. In 1784, she married a district medical officer and son of lawyer (1715–1797), Johann Franz Wilhelm Böhmer (1754–1788), and the couple moved to Clausthal in the Harz. After his death in 1788, she tried to live financially independently. Together with their only surviving daughter she moved to Göttingen, then Marburg, and in 1792 she settled in Mainz.

In Mainz, Schelling joined the intellectual circle around Georg Forster, who had married her childhood friend Therese Huber. Forster was an explorer, journalist, and revolutionary. When Mainz was occupied by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars, she moved into Forster&#x27;s house. Mainz was declared a republic, aligned with France (see Republic of Mainz). But when Prussian troops recaptured Mainz (22 July 1793), Schelling was imprisoned for her political opinions. Schelling was pregnant and asked friends and family for help. She was released and August Schlegel arranged for her to give birth under an assumed name in Lucka near Leipzig.

Schelling and August Schlegel married in 1796, and she moved to Jena, where he had received a professorship. Their house became a meeting place for the young literary and intellectual elite later associated with German Romanticism. His brother Friedrich Schlegel and Friedrich&#x27;s wife Dorothea Veit moved in. They were at the centre of Jena Romanticism. Schelling was involved in the literary projects of her husband and his brother. She is credited with contributing to many of the 300 reviews her husband published in the Jena &quot;Allgemeine Literaturzeitung&quot; between 1796 and 1799.

In 1803, she divorced Schlegel and married the young philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. Her new husband was at the center of Romantic natural philosophy. The couple moved to Würzburg, but were maligned by gossip. In 1806, they moved to Munich, where Friedrich Schelling received a professorship and was honored for his work.

Between 1805 and 1807, Schelling published several reviews in her own name and assisted her husband in his reviews, which shaped Romantic literature and literary taste. She also engaged in extensive correspondence with numerous Romantics. Having suffered poor health for some time, she died of dysentery in 1809.

<text>Richard Douglas Husband (July 12, 1957 – February 1, 2003) was an American astronaut and fighter pilot. He traveled into space twice: as pilot of STS-96 and commander of STS-107. Husband and the rest of the crew of STS-107 were killed when &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated during reentry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. He is also a recipient of the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

==Early life, education and training==
Husband was born on July 12, 1957, in Amarillo, Texas. When he was 17, Husband earned his pilot&#x27;s license while flying out of Tradewind Airport. He graduated with honors from Amarillo High School in 1975.

Husband earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Texas Tech University in 1980 after five years of study. He earned his Master of Science degree from Fresno State University. Upon graduation, Husband was commissioned as a pilot in the United States Air Force, having been enrolled in ROTC his last two years of college. Husband underwent pilot training at Vance Air Force Base, in Enid, Oklahoma. This was followed by Land Survival School at Fairchild Air Force Base, in Spokane, Washington, and Fighter Lead-in School in New Mexico. After he got married on February 27, 1982, Husband trained in the F-4 at Homestead Air Force Base next.

==U.S. Air Force career==
Husband was assigned to a squadron at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Georgia, flying the F-4E. He then transferred to George AFB, in Victorville, California in December 1985, where Husband became an F-4 instructor. By then, he had accumulated 1000 hours of flying time.

In December 1987, Husband was assigned to Edwards Air Force Base in California, where he attended the USAF Test Pilot School class 88A along with future Canadian Space Agency astronaut Chris Hadfield. Upon completion of test pilot school, Husband served as a test pilot flying the F-4 and all five models of the F-15 Eagle. In the F-15 Combined Test Force, he was the program manager for the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229 increased performance engine, and also served as the F-15 Aerial Demonstration Pilot.

In June 1992, Husband was assigned to the Aircraft and Armament Evaluation Establishment at Boscombe Down, England, as an exchange test pilot with the Royal Air Force. At Boscombe Down, he was the Tornado GR1 and GR4 Project Pilot and served as a test pilot in the Hawk, Hunter, Buccaneer, Jet Provost, Tucano, and Harvard.

Husband logged over 3,800 hours of flight time in more than 40 different types of aircraft.

==NASA career==
Husband was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994, the same week he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Husband reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995 to begin a year of training and evaluation. Upon completion of training, he was named the Astronaut Office representative for Advanced Projects at Johnson Space Center, working on Space Shuttle Upgrades, the Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) and studies to return to the Moon and travel to Mars. Husband eventually served as Chief of Safety for the Astronaut Office. He flew as pilot on STS-96 in 1999, and logged 235 hours and 13 minutes in space. Husband was later assigned to command the crew of STS-107, which was launched early in 2003. Along with the rest of the STS-107 crew, Husband was killed upon reentry when the shuttle disintegrated over Texas.

==Shuttle missions==

*STS-96 (May 27 to June 6, 1999) aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; was a 10-day mission during which the crew performed the first docking with the International Space Station and delivered four tons of logistics and supplies in preparation for the arrival of the first crew to live on the station early the following year. The mission was accomplished in 153 Earth orbits, traveling 4 million miles in 9 days, 19 hours and 13 minutes.

*STS-107 (January 16 to February 1, 2003) aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; was a 16-day mission during which the crew performed over 80 experiments testing applications of microgravity to gain insight into the environment of space and improve life on Earth as well as enable future space exploration. The mission ended on the morning of February 1 when the shuttle disintegrated upon reentry killing all crew members, including Husband (see Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster).

==Personal life==

Husband&#x27;s wife, Evelyn (born September 18, 1958), details her Christian life with Rick and his struggles to fulfill his lifelong dream to become an astronaut in the 2004 book &quot;High Calling: The Courageous Life and Faith of Space Shuttle Columbia Commander Rick Husband&quot; co-written with Donna VanLiere. The Husbands have two children: a daughter, Laura Marie (born October 5, 1990), and a son, Matthew (born August 3, 1995). Evelyn married Bill Thompson in January 2008 and was the keynote speaker for the memorial ceremony at the Astronaut Memorial &quot;Space Mirror&quot; at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, five years after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; tragedy.

== In popular culture ==
*American actor Brian David portrayed Rick Husband in the American TV series &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; Season 2: Episode 1 (2005) called &quot;Space Shuttle Columbia&quot;.

<text>The Glenn L. Martin Company, also known as The Martin Company from 1917 to 1961, was an American aircraft and aerospace manufacturing company founded by aviation pioneer Glenn L. Martin. The Martin Company produced many important aircraft for the defense of the US and allies, especially during World War II and the Cold War. During the 1950s and &#x27;60s, the Martin Company moved from the aircraft industry into the guided missile, space exploration, and space utilization industries.

In 1961, the Martin Company merged with American-Marietta Corporation, a large industrial conglomerate, forming the Martin Marietta corporation. In turn, Martin Marietta in 1995 merged with aerospace giant Lockheed Corporation to form the Lockheed Martin corporation.

==History==

===Origins===
Glenn L. Martin Company was founded by aviation pioneer Glenn Luther Martin on August 16, 1912. He started the company building military training aircraft in Santa Ana, California, and in September 1916, Martin accepted a merger offer from the Wright Company, creating the Wright-Martin Aircraft Company. This merger did not function well, so Glenn Martin left to form a second Glenn L. Martin Company on September 10, 1917. This new company was headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio.

===Mexican Revolution===

In 1913, Mexican insurgents from the northwestern state of Sonora bought a single-seater Martin Pusher biplane in Los Angeles with the intention of attacking federal naval forces that were attacking the port of Guaymas. The aircraft was shipped on May 5, 1913, in five crates to Tucson, Arizona, via Wells Fargo Express, and then moved through the border into Mexico to the town of Naco, Sonora. The aircraft, named &quot;Sonora&quot; by the insurgents, was reassembled there and fitted with a second seat for a bomber position.

The &quot;Sonora&quot;, armed with rudimentary 3-inch pipe bombs, performed the first known air-to-naval bombing runs in history.

===World War I===

For the Dutch East Indies, several planes were delivered, with the first flight on November 6, 1915. It involved two Type TEs, six Type TTs, and eight Type Rs. Martin&#x27;s first big success came during World War I with the MB-1 bomber, a large biplane design ordered by the United States Army on January 17, 1918. The MB-1 entered service after the end of hostilities. A follow-up design, the MB-2, proved successful; 20 were ordered by the Army Air Service, the first five of them under the company designation and the last 15 as the NBS-1 (Night Bomber, Short range). Although the War Department ordered 110 more, it retained the ownership rights of the design, and put the order out for bid. The production orders were given to other companies that had bid lower, Curtiss (50), L.W.F. Engineering (35), and Aeromarine (25). The design was the only standard bomber used by the Air Service until 1930, and was used by seven squadrons of the Air Service/Air Corps: Four in Virginia, two in Hawaii, and one in the Philippines.

===Inter-war years===
In 1924, the Martin Company underbid Curtiss for the production of a Curtiss-designed scout bomber, the SC-1, and ultimately Martin produced 404 of these. In 1929, Martin sold the Cleveland plant and built a new one in Middle River, Maryland, northeast of Baltimore.

During the 1930s, Martin built flying boats for the U.S. Navy, and the innovative Martin B-10 bomber for the Army. The Martin Company also produced the noted China Clipper flying boats used by Pan American Airways for its transpacific San Francisco to the Philippines route.

===World War II===
During World War II, a few of Martin&#x27;s most successful designs were the B-26 Marauder and A-22 Maryland bombers, the PBM Mariner and JRM Mars flying boats, widely used for air-sea rescue, anti-submarine warfare and transport. The 1941 Office for Emergency Management film &quot;Bomber&quot; was filmed in the Martin facility in Baltimore, and showed aspects of the production of the B-26.

Martin ranked 14th among U.S. corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. The company built 1,585 B-26 Marauders and 531 Boeing B-29 Superfortresses at its new bomber plant in Nebraska, just south of Omaha at Offutt Field. Among the B-29s manufactured there were all the Silverplate aircraft, including &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bockscar&quot;, which dropped the two war-ending atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.

===Postwar===

On April 22, 1957, the company name was changed to the Martin Company.

Postwar efforts in aeronautics by the Martin Company included two unsuccessful prototype bombers, the XB-48 and the XB-51, the marginally successful AM Mauler, the successful B-57 Canberra tactical bombers, the P5M Marlin and P6M SeaMaster seaplanes, and the Martin 4-0-4 twin-engined passenger airliner.
The Martin Company moved into the aerospace manufacturing business. It produced the Vanguard rocket, used by the American space program as one of its first satellite booster rockets as part of Project Vanguard. The Vanguard was the first American space exploration rocket designed from scratch to be an orbital launch vehicle — rather than being a modified ballistic missile (such as the U.S. Army&#x27;s Juno I). Martin also designed and manufactured the huge and heavily armed Titan I and LGM-25C Titan II intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Martin Company of Orlando, Florida, was the prime contractor for the US Army&#x27;s Pershing missile.

The Martin Company was one of two finalists for the command and service modules of the Apollo Program. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) awarded the design and production contracts for these to the North American Aviation Corporation.

The Martin Company went further in the production of larger booster rockets for NASA and the U.S. Air Force with its Titan III series of over 100 rockets produced, including the Titan IIIA, the more-important Titan IIIC, and the Titan IIIE. Besides hundreds of Earth satellites, these rockets were essential for the sending to outer space of the two space probes of the Voyager Project to the outer planets, the two space probes of the Viking Project to Mars, and the two Helios probes into low orbits around the Sun (closer, even, than Mercury).

Finally, the US Air Force required a booster rocket that could launch heavier satellites than either the Titan IIIE or the Space Shuttle. The Martin Company responded with its extremely large Titan IV series of rockets. When the Titan IV came into service, it could carry a heavier payload to orbit than any other rocket in production. Besides its use by the Air Force to launch its sequence of very heavy reconnaissance satellites, one Titan IV, with a powerful Centaur rocket upper stage, was used to launch the heavy Cassini space probe to the planet Saturn in 1997. The Cassini probe orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, successfully returning mountains of scientific data.

The halting of production of the Titan IV in 2004 brought to an end production of the last rocket able to carry a heavier payload than the Space Shuttle, which itself ended in 2011.

The Martin Company merged with the American-Marietta Corporation, a chemical-products and construction-materials manufacturer, in 1961, to form the Martin Marietta Corporation. In 1995, Martin Marietta, then the nation&#x27;s third-largest defense contractor, merged with the Lockheed Corporation, then the nation&#x27;s second-largest defense contractor, to form the Lockheed Martin Corporation, becoming the largest such company in the world.

The Martin Company employed many of the founders and chief engineers of the American aerospace industry, including:

* Dandridge M. Cole – moved on as aerospace engineer at General Electric
* Donald Douglas – founder of Douglas Aircraft, later as McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing)
* Lawrence Dale Bell – founded Bell Aircraft, now Bell Helicopter
* James S. McDonnell – founded McDonnell Aircraft, later as McDonnell Douglas (now part of Boeing)
* J.H. &quot;Dutch&quot; Kindleberger – CEO and chairman of North American Aviation
* Hans Multhopp – concepts used to create NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle
* C. A. Van Dusen – Brewster Aeronautical Corporation

Martin also taught William Boeing how to fly and sold him his first airplane.

<text>Gottfried August Bürger (31 December 1747 – 8 June 1794) was a German poet. His ballads were very popular in Germany. His most noted ballad, &quot;Lenore&quot;, found an audience beyond readers of the German language in an English and Russian adaptation and a French translation.

==Biography==
Bürger was born in Molmerswende (now a part of Mansfeld), Principality of Halberstadt, where his father was the Lutheran pastor.
He showed an early predilection for solitary and gloomy places and the making of verses, for which he had no other model than hymnals. At the age of twelve, he was practically adopted by his maternal grandfather, Bauer, at Aschersleben, who sent him to the Pädagogium at Halle. He learned Latin with difficulty. In 1764, he gained admission into the University of Halle as a student of theology, which, however, he soon abandoned for the study of jurisprudence. There he fell under the influence of Christian Adolph Klotz (1738–1771), who directed Bürger&#x27;s attention to literature and encouraged his natural disposition to a wild and unregulated life. In consequence of his dissipated habits, he was in 1767 recalled by his grandfather, but on promising to reform was in 1768 allowed to enter the University of Göttingen as a law student.

As he continued his wild career, however, his grandfather withdrew his support and he was left to his own. Meanwhile, he had made fair progress with his legal studies, and had the good fortune to form a close friendship with a number of young men of literary tastes. He studied the ancient classics and the best works in French, Italian, Spanish and English, particularly Shakespeare, and the old English and Scottish ballads. Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; was his constant companion. In the Göttingen &quot;Musenalmanach&quot;, edited by Heinrich Christian Boie and Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter, Bürger&#x27;s first poems were published, and by 1771 he had already become widely known as a poet. In 1772, through Boie&#x27;s influence, Bürger obtained the post of &quot;Amtmann&quot; or district magistrate at Altengleichen near Göttingen. His grandfather was now reconciled to him, paid his debts and established him in his new sphere of activity.

Meanwhile, he kept in touch with his Göttingen friends, and when the &quot;Göttinger Bund&quot; or &quot;Hain&quot; (&quot;Göttinger Hainbund&quot;) was formed, Bürger, though not himself a member, kept in close touch with it. In 1773, the ballad &quot;Lenore&quot; was published in the &quot;Musenalmanach&quot;. This poem, which in dramatic force and in its vivid realization of the weird and supernatural remains without a rival, made his name a household word in Göttingen. &quot;Lenore&quot; was paraphrased by Walter Scott under the title &quot;William and Helen&quot; and Goethe did the same under the title &quot;Bride of Corinth&quot;. In 1774 he married Dorette Leonhart, the daughter of a Hanoverian official; but his passion for his wife&#x27;s younger sister Auguste (the &quot;Molly&quot; of his poems and elegies) rendered the union unhappy and unsettled his life. In 1778 Bürger became editor of the &quot;Musenalmanach&quot;, a position he retained until his death. In the same year published the first collection of his poems. In 1780 he took a farm at Appenrode, but in three years lost so much money that he had to abandon the venture. Pecuniary troubles oppressed him, and being accused of neglecting his official duties, and feeling his honour attacked, he gave up his official position and removed in 1784 to Göttingen, where he established himself as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;.
Shortly before his removal there his wife died (30 July 1784), and on 29 June the next year he married his sister-in-law &quot;Molly.&quot; Her death in childbirth on 9 January 1786 affected him deeply. He appeared to lose at once all courage and all bodily and mental vigour. He still continued to teach in Göttingen; at the jubilee of the foundation of the university in 1787 he was made an honorary doctor of philosophy, and in 1789 was appointed extraordinary professor in that faculty, though without a stipend. He was obliged to gain his living by poorly rewarded translations for booksellers.

In 1790, he married a third time, his wife being a certain Elise Hahn, who, enchanted with his poems, had offered him her heart and hand. Only a few weeks of married life with his &quot;Schwabenmädchen&quot; sufficed to prove his mistake, and after two and a half years he divorced her. Deeply wounded by Schiller&#x27;s criticism, in the 14th and 15th part of the &quot;Allgemeine Literaturzeitung&quot; of 1791, of the second edition of his poems, disappointed, wrecked in fortune and health, Bürger eked out a precarious existence as a teacher in Göttingen until, ill with tuberculosis, he died there on 8 June 1794. The government of Hanover afforded him some assistance shortly before his death.

Bürger&#x27;s talent for popular poetry was very considerable, and his ballads are among the finest in the German language. Besides &quot;Lenore&quot;, &quot;Das Lied vom braven Manne&quot;, &quot;Die Kuh&quot;, &quot;Der Kaiser und der Abt&quot; and &quot;Der wilde Jäger&quot; are famous. Among his purely lyrical poems, but few have earned a lasting reputation; but mention may be made of &quot;Das Blümchen Wunderhold&quot;, &quot;Lied an den lieben Mond&quot;, and a few love songs. His sonnets, particularly the elegies, are of great beauty. Bürger revived the sonnet form in German, and his experiments in it were praised as models by Schiller, despite his severe criticism of some of Bürger&#x27;s more popular poems.

==Editions==
Editions of Bürger&#x27;s &quot;Sämtliche Schriften&quot; appeared at Göttingen, 1817 (incomplete); 1829–1833 (8 vols.), and 1835 (one vol.); also a selection by Eduard Grisebach (5th ed, 1894). The &quot;Gedichte&quot; have been published in innumerable editions, the best being that by August Sauer (2 vols., 1884). &quot;Briefe von und an Bürger&quot; were edited by Adolf Strodtmann in 4 vols. (1874). Bürger was introduced to English readers in &quot;William and Helen&quot; (1775), Walter Scott&#x27;s version of &quot;Lenore&quot;. The elder Dumas translated &quot;Lenore&quot; into French.

Bürger is known for German translations of &quot;Baron Munchausen’s narrative of his marvellous travels and campaigns in Russia&quot; by Rudolf Erich Raspe (1786, after the release of the 4th English edition; 2nd expanded ed. 1788, after the release of the 5th expanded English edition). In his introduction to the 1788 German edition, Bürger admitted to adapting and elaborating the original English-language works, and, despite his clear notice that he was doing a translation, for some time Bürger was believed to be the author of the tales. Raspe had originally concealed his authorship.

<doc id="177597" wikidata="Q334463" url="?curid=177597" title="William C. McCool">
<text>William Cameron &quot;Willie&quot; McCool (born William Cameron Graham September 23, 1961 – February 1, 2003) was an American naval officer and aviator, test pilot, aeronautical engineer, and NASA astronaut, who was the pilot of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; mission STS-107. He and the rest of the crew of STS-107 were killed when &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated during reentry into the atmosphere. McCool was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

== Early and personal life ==
McCool was born on September 23, 1961, in San Diego, California. His parents divorced when McCool was young, and in 1969, his mother married Barent McCool, a Naval aviator. McCool was active in the Boy Scouts of America, where he became an Eagle Scout. His favorite song was &quot;Imagine&quot; by John Lennon, which was played during the STS-107 mission. McCool&#x27;s favorite band was Radiohead, and the song &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; was played by Mission Control as a wake-up call.
McCool died at age 41 on February 1, 2003, when Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; broke up over the southern United States during reentry. He was survived by his wife, Lani, and their three sons. McCool is buried in Anacortes, Washington, where he lived at the time of his death.

== Education ==

* 1976–77: Attended John F. Kennedy High School, Tamuning, Guam
* 1979: Graduated from Coronado High School, Lubbock, Texas.
* 1983: Received a Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Science from the United States Naval Academy.
* 1985: Received a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park.
* 1991: Graduated from United States Naval Test Pilot School, Naval Air Station Patuxent River - Class 101.
* 1992: Received a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.

== Flight experience ==

McCool completed flight training and was designated a Naval Aviator in August 1986. He was assigned to Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 129 (VAQ-129) at NAS Whidbey Island, Washington, for initial EA-6B Prowler training. McCool&#x27;s first operational tour was with Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 133 (VAQ-133), where he made two deployments aboard the aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean Sea and received designation as a wing-qualified landing signal officer (LSO). In November 1989, McCool was selected for the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School/Test Pilot School (TPS) Cooperative Education Program.

After graduating from TPS in June 1992, McCool worked as a TA-4J and EA-6B test pilot in Flight Systems Department of Strike Aircraft Test Directorate at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. He was responsible for the management and conduct of a wide variety of projects, ranging from airframe fatigue life studies to numerous avionics upgrades. However, McCool&#x27;s primary efforts were dedicated to flight test of the Advanced Capability (ADVCAP) EA-6B. Following his Patuxent River tour, McCool returned to Whidbey Island, and was assigned to Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 132 (VAQ-132) aboard the carrier . He served as Administrative and Operations Officer with the squadron through their work-up cycle, receiving notice of his NASA selection while embarked on &quot;Enterprise&quot; for her final pre-deployment at sea period.

McCool accumulated over 2,800 flight hours in 24 aircraft as well as more than 400 carrier arrestments, also known as &quot;traps&quot;.

== NASA experience ==

Selected by NASA in April 1996, McCool reported to the Johnson Space Center the following August. He completed two years of training and evaluation, and was qualified for flight assignment as a pilot. Initially assigned to the Computer Support Branch, McCool also served as technical assistant to the director of flight crew operations, and worked Shuttle cockpit upgrade issues for the Astronaut Office.

=== Spaceflight experience ===

McCool was pilot of Space Shuttle mission STS-107, January 16 to February 1, 2003, logging 15 days, 22 hours and 20 minutes in space. The 16-day flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. According to NASA, McCool said of the unique view he and his crewmates had from Columbia:
STS-107&#x27;s mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003, when &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated during re-entry, 16 minutes before scheduled landing. All seven crew members were killed.

McCool was posthumously awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal, the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Distinguished Service Medal (DDSM), and the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

<doc id="177602" wikidata="Q4169" url="?curid=177602" title="Outer space">
<text>Outer space (or simply space) is the expanse that exists beyond Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and between celestial bodies. It contains ultra-low levels of particle densities, constituting a near-perfect vacuum of predominantly hydrogen and helium plasma, permeated by electromagnetic radiation, cosmic rays, neutrinos, magnetic fields and dust. The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is . 

The plasma between galaxies is thought to account for about half of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in the universe, having a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a kinetic temperature of millions of kelvins. Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies. Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space. Most of the remaining mass-energy in the observable universe is made up of an unknown form, dubbed dark matter and dark energy.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above Earth&#x27;s surface. The Kármán line, an altitude of above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. Certain portions of the upper stratosphere and the mesosphere are sometimes referred to as &quot;near space&quot;. The framework for international space law was established by the Outer Space Treaty, which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of national sovereignty and permits all states to freely explore outer space. Despite the drafting of UN resolutions for the peaceful uses of outer space, anti-satellite weapons have been tested in Earth orbit.

The concept that the space between the Earth and the Moon must be a vacuum was first proposed in the 17th century after scientists discovered that air pressure decreased with altitude. The immense scale of outer space was grasped in the 20th century when the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was first measured. Humans began the physical exploration of space later in the same century with the advent of high-altitude balloon flights. This was followed by crewed rocket flights and, then, crewed Earth orbit, first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961. The economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high, limiting human spaceflight to low Earth orbit and the Moon. On the other hand, uncrewed spacecraft have reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and radiation. Microgravity has a negative effect on human physiology that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss.

== Terminology ==
The use of the short version &quot;space&quot;, as meaning &quot;the region beyond Earth&#x27;s sky&quot;, predates the use of full term &quot;outer space&quot;, with the earliest recorded use of this meaning in an epic poem by John Milton called &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, published in 1667.

The term &quot;outward space&quot; existed in a poem from 1842 by the English poet Lady Emmeline Stuart-Wortley called &quot;The Maiden of Moscow&quot;, but in astronomy the term &quot;outer space&quot; found its application for the first time in 1845 by Alexander von Humboldt. The term was eventually popularized through the writings of H. G. Wells after 1901. Theodore von Kármán used the term of &quot;free space&quot; to name the space of altitudes above Earth where spacecrafts reach conditions sufficiently free from atmospheric drag, differentiating it from airspace, identifying a legal space above territories free from the sovereign jurisdiction of countries.

&quot;Spaceborne&quot; denotes existing in outer space, especially if carried by a spacecraft; similarly, &quot;space-based&quot; means based in outer space or on a planet or moon.

== Formation and state ==

The size of the whole universe is unknown, and it might be infinite in extent. According to the Big Bang theory, the very early universe was an extremely hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago which rapidly expanded. About 380,000 years later the universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space. Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory constrains the size of the directly observable universe.

The present day shape of the universe has been determined from measurements of the cosmic microwave background using satellites like the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. These observations indicate that the spatial geometry of the observable universe is &quot;flat&quot;, meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity. The flat universe, combined with the measured mass density of the universe and the accelerating expansion of the universe, indicates that space has a non-zero vacuum energy, which is called dark energy.

Estimates put the average energy density of the present day universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the universe is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, at least in terms of visible matter. Unlike matter and dark matter, dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the universe, dark energy&#x27;s influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.

== Environment ==
Outer space is the closest known approximation to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets, and moons to move freely along their ideal orbits, following the initial formation stage. The deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023 km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.

Stars, planets, and moons retain their atmospheres by gravitational attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary: the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space. The Earth&#x27;s atmospheric pressure drops to about Pa at of altitude, compared to 100,000 Pa for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) definition of standard pressure. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to radiation pressure from the Sun and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. The thermosphere in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to space weather.

The temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the kinetic activity of the gas, as it is on Earth. The radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the Big Bang, which is known as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of neutrinos called the cosmic neutrino background.) The current black body temperature of the background radiation is about . The gas temperatures in outer space can vary widely. For example, the temperature in the Boomerang Nebula is , while the solar corona reaches temperatures over .

Magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10 μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align themselves with a galaxy&#x27;s magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This has been used to show ordered magnetic fields that exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources have been detected even among the most distant high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.

Outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field, there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic subatomic particles known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 106 eV up to an extreme 1020 eV of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 109 eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of electrons is only about 1% of that of protons. Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a health threat to space travelers.

Smells retained from low Earth orbit, when returning from extravehicular activity, have a burned/metallic odor, similar to the scent of arc welding fumes, resulting from oxygen in low Earth orbit around the ISS, which clings to suits and equipment. Other regions of space could have very different smells, like that of different alcohols in molecular clouds.

=== Effect on biology and human bodies ===


Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot; germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; has survived 559 days when exposed to low Earth orbit or a simulated Martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.

====Vacuum====

The lack of pressure in space is the most immediate dangerous characteristic of space to humans. Pressure decreases above Earth, reaching a level at an altitude of around that matches the vapor pressure of water at the temperature of the human body. This pressure level is called the Armstrong line, named after American physician Harry G. Armstrong. At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule.

Out in space, sudden exposure of an unprotected human to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest. Even if the subject&#x27;s airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.

As a consequence of rapid decompression, oxygen dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the partial pressure gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes. Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below , and this condition is called ebullism. The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid.

Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a pressure suit. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as . Supplemental oxygen is needed at to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism. Most space suits use around of pure oxygen, about the same as the partial pressure of oxygen at the Earth&#x27;s surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause decompression sickness and gas embolisms if not managed.

====Weightlessness and radiation====

Humans evolved for life in Earth gravity, and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.

During long-duration space travel, radiation can pose an acute health hazard. Exposure to high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the white blood cell count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut&#x27;s body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei. The energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. The impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.

=== Boundary ===

The transition between Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and outer space lacks a well-defined physical boundary, with the air pressure steadily decreasing with altitude until it mixes with the solar wind. Various definitions for a practical boundary have been proposed, ranging from out to .

High-altitude aircraft, such as high-altitude balloons have reached altitudes above Earth of up to 50 km. Up until 2021, the United States designated people who travel above an altitude of as astronauts. Astronaut wings are now only awarded to spacecraft crew members that &quot;demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety, or contributed to human space flight safety&quot;.

In 2009, measurements of the direction and speed of ions in the atmosphere were made from a sounding rocket. The altitude of above Earth was the midpoint for charged particles transitioning from the gentle winds of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to the more extreme flows of outer space. The latter can reach velocities well over . 

Spacecraft have entered into a highly elliptical orbit with a perigee as low as , surviving for multiple orbits. At an altitude of , descending spacecraft such as NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle begin atmospheric entry (termed the Entry Interface), when atmospheric drag becomes noticeable, thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces.

The Kármán line, established by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, and used internationally by the United Nations, is set at an altitude of as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This line is named after Theodore von Kármán, who argued for an altitude where a vehicle would have to travel faster than orbital velocity to derive sufficient aerodynamic lift from the atmosphere to support itself, which he calculated to be at an altitude of about . This distinguishes altitudes below as the region of aerodynamics and airspace, and above as the space of astronautics and &quot;free space&quot;.

There is no internationally recognized legal altitude limit on national airspace, although the Kármán line is the most frequently used for this purpose. Objections have been made to setting this limit too high, as it could inhibit space activities due to concerns about airspace violations. It has been argued for setting no specified singular altitude in international law, instead applying different limits depending on the case, in particular based on the craft and its purpose. Spacecraft have flown over foreign countries as low as , as in the example of the Space Shuttle.

=== Legal status ===
The Outer Space Treaty provides the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of &quot;outer space&quot;, the Moon, and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national sovereignty, calling outer space the &quot;province of all mankind&quot;. This status as a common heritage of mankind has been used, though not without opposition, to enforce the right to access and shared use of outer space for all nations equally, particularly non-spacefaring nations. It prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in outer space. The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the United States of America (USA), and the United Kingdom (UK). As of 2017, 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty. An additional 25 states signed the treaty, without ratifying it.

Since 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple United Nations resolutions. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN&#x27;s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the USA, USSR, China, and in 2019, India. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. The treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices human spaceflight.

In 1976, eight equatorial states (Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, The Republic of the Congo, Zaire, Uganda, Kenya, and Indonesia) met in Bogotá, Colombia: with their &quot;Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries&quot;, or the Bogotá Declaration, they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.

An increasing issue of international space law and regulation has been the dangers of the growing number of space debris.

=== Earth orbit ===

A spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a low Earth orbit, this velocity is about ; by contrast, the fastest piloted airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was in 1967 by the North American X-15.

To achieve an orbit, a spacecraft must travel faster than a sub-orbital spaceflight along an arcing trajectory. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of is about 36 MJ/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude. The escape velocity required to pull free of Earth&#x27;s gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about .

Orbiting spacecraft with a perigee below about are subject to drag from the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite&#x27;s cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. At altitudes above , orbital lifetime is measured in centuries. Below about , decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to , it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere.

Low Earth orbit overlaps the inner Van Allen radiation belt, a toroidal region composed primarily of high energy protons. This region represents a space weather threat to space systems and is difficult to shield against. Operational problems for satellites are particularly prevalent over the South Atlantic Anomaly, where charged particles approach closest to Earth.

== Regions ==

===Regions near the Earth===
Space in proximity to the Earth is physically similar to the remainder of interplanetary space, but is home to a multitude of Earth–orbiting satellites and has been subject to extensive studies. For identification purposes, this volume is divided into overlapping regions of space.

 is the region of space extending from low Earth orbits out to geostationary orbits. This region includes the major orbits for artificial satellites and is the site of most of humanity&#x27;s space activity. The region has seen high levels of space debris, sometimes dubbed space pollution, threatening any space activity in this region. Some of this debris re-enters Earth&#x27;s atmosphere periodically. Although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density inside low-Earth orbital space, the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line, is still sufficient to produce significant drag on satellites.

Geospace is a region of space that includes Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere and magnetosphere. The Van Allen radiation belts lie within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the magnetopause, which forms an interface between the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the ionosphere.

The variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the Sun and the solar wind; the subject of geospace is interlinked with heliophysics—the study of the Sun and its impact on the planets of the Solar System. The day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure—the subsolar distance from the center of the Earth is typically 10 Earth radii. On the night side, the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a magnetotail that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 Earth radii. For roughly four days of each month, the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the Moon passes through the magnetotail.

Geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere. Geomagnetic storms can disturb two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, interfering with shortwave radio communication and GPS location and timing. Magnetic storms can be a hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles.
xGeo space is a concept used by the US to refer to space of high Earth orbits, ranging from beyond geosynchronous orbit (GEO) at approximately , out to the L2 Earth-Moon Lagrange point at . This is located beyond the orbit of the Moon and therefore includes cislunar space. Translunar space is the region of lunar transfer orbits, between the Moon and Earth. Cislunar space is a region outside of Earth that includes lunar orbits, the Moon&#x27;s orbital space around Earth and the Lagrange points.

The region where a body&#x27;s gravitational potential remains dominant against gravitational potentials from other bodies, is the body&#x27;s sphere of influence or gravity well, mostly described with the Hill sphere model. In the case of Earth this includes all space from the Earth to a distance of roughly 1% of the mean distance from Earth to the Sun, or . Beyond Earth&#x27;s Hill sphere extends along Earth&#x27;s orbital path its orbital and co-orbital space. This space is co-populated by groups of co-orbital Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), such as horseshoe librators and Earth trojans, with some NEOs at times becoming temporary satellites and quasi-moons to Earth.
Deep space is defined by the United States government as all of outer space which lies further from Earth than a typical low-Earth-orbit, thus assigning the Moon to deep-space. Other definitions vary the starting point of deep-space from, &quot;That which lies beyond the orbit of the moon,&quot; to &quot;That which lies beyond the farthest reaches of the Solar System itself.&quot; The International Telecommunication Union responsible for radio communication, including with satellites, defines deep-space as, &quot;distances from the Earth equal to, or greater than, ,&quot; which is about five times the Moon&#x27;s orbital distance, but which distance is also far less than the distance between Earth and any adjacent planet.
=== Interplanetary space ===

Interplanetary space within the Solar System is the space between the eight planets, the space between the planets and the Sun, as well as that space beyond the orbit of the outermost planet Neptune where the solar wind remains active. The solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun which creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the heliosphere) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 protons/cm3 and is moving at a velocity of . Interplanetary space extends out to the heliopause where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun. The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind. The heliopause in turn deflects away low-energy galactic cosmic rays, with this modulation effect peaking during solar maximum.

The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital distance of the Earth. This space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light.

Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun. There are magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of charged particles such as the Van Allen radiation belts. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.

=== Interstellar space ===


Interstellar space is the physical space outside of the bubbles of plasma known as astrospheres, formed by stellar winds originating from individual stars, or formed by solar wind emanating from the Sun. It is the space between the stars or stellar systems within a nebula or galaxy. Interstellar space contains an interstellar medium of sparse matter and radiation. The boundary between an astrosphere and interstellar space is known as an astropause. For the Sun, the astrosphere and astropause are called the heliosphere and heliopause.

Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova propagates shock waves of stellar ejecta outward, distributing it throughout the interstellar medium, including the heavy elements previously formed within the star&#x27;s core. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.

A number of molecules exist in interstellar space, which can form dust particles as tiny as 0.1 μm. The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.

The local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100 pc of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the Local Bubble, which is characterized by a lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the constellations of Ophiuchus and Taurus. The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250 pc or more. This volume contains about 104–105 stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the astrospheres that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000 K and radii of 0.5–5 pc.

When stars are moving at sufficiently high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades it was assumed that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA&#x27;s Voyager probes showed that the Sun&#x27;s bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is a third boundary characteristic of an astrosphere, lying outside the termination shock and the astropause.

=== Intergalactic space ===

Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. Studies of the large-scale distribution of galaxies show that the universe has a foam-like structure, with groups and clusters of galaxies lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space. The remainder forms cosmic voids that are mostly empty of galaxies. Typically, a void spans a distance of 7–30 megaparsecs.

Surrounding and stretching between galaxies is the intergalactic medium (IGM). This rarefied plasma is organized in a galactic filamentary structure. The diffuse photoionized gas contains filaments of higher density, about one atom per cubic meter, which is 5–200 times the average density of the universe. The IGM is inferred to be mostly primordial in composition, with 76% hydrogen by mass, and enriched with higher mass elements from high-velocity galactic outflows.

As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 105 K to 107 K. At these temperatures, it is called the warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 105 K is often called &quot;warm&quot; in astrophysics. Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state. When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 108 K and above in the so-called intracluster medium (ICM).

== History of discovery ==

In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle suggested that &quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot;, a principle that became known as the &quot;horror vacui&quot;. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.

In ancient China, the 2nd-century astronomer Zhang Heng became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hsüan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, &quot;empty and void of substance&quot;. Likewise, the &quot;sun, moon, and the company of stars float in the empty space, moving or standing still&quot;.

The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum. It would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. Torricelli suggested that since air has weight, then air pressure should decrease with altitude. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal proposed an experiment to test this hypothesis. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.

In 1650, German scientist Otto von Guericke constructed the first vacuum pump: a device that would further refute the principle of &quot;horror vacui&quot;. He correctly noted that the atmosphere of the Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.

In the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus speculated that the universe lacked a center and a circumference. He believed that the universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology to the concept of an infinite universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies. English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void. This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move.

The concept of a universe filled with a luminiferous aether retained support among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth&#x27;s motion through this medium by looking for changes in the speed of light depending on the direction of the planet&#x27;s motion. The null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer&#x27;s motion or frame of reference.

The first professional astronomer to support the concept of an infinite universe was the Englishman Thomas Digges in 1576. But the scale of the universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel. He showed that the star system 61 Cygni had a parallax of just 0.31 arcseconds (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 light years. In 1917, Heber Curtis noted that novae in spiral nebulae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae, suggesting that the former are 100 times further away. The distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was determined in 1923 by American astronomer Edwin Hubble by measuring the brightness of cepheid variables in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by Henrietta Leavitt. This established that the Andromeda Galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the Milky Way. With this Hubble formulated the Hubble constant, which allowed for the first time a calculation of the age of the Universe and size of the Observable Universe, starting at 2 billion years and 280 million light-years. This became increasingly precise with better measurements, until 2006 when data of the Hubble Space Telescope allowed a very accurate calculation of the age of the Universe and size of the Observable Universe.

The modern concept of outer space is based on the &quot;Big Bang&quot; cosmology, first proposed in 1931 by the Belgian physicist Georges Lemaître. This theory holds that the universe originated from a state of extreme energy density that has since undergone continuous expansion.

The earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist Charles É. Guillaume in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6 K. British physicist Arthur Eddington made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18 K in 1926. German physicist Erich Regener used the total measured energy of cosmic rays to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8 K in 1933. American physicists Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman predicted 5 K for the temperature of space in 1948, based on the gradual decrease in background energy following the then-new Big Bang theory.

== Exploration ==


For most of human history, space was explored by observations made from the Earth&#x27;s surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Before reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through balloon flights. In 1935, the American &quot;Explorer II&quot; crewed balloon flight reached an altitude of . This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German A-4 rocket climbed to an altitude of about . In 1957, the uncrewed satellite Sputnik 1 was launched by a Russian R-7 rocket, achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of . This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin was sent into orbit on Vostok 1. The first humans to escape low Earth orbit were Frank Borman, Jim Lovell and William Anders in 1968 on board the American Apollo 8, which achieved lunar orbit and reached a maximum distance of from the Earth.

The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet &quot;Luna 1&quot;, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959. In 1961, &quot;Venera 1&quot; became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by Mariner 2. The first fly-by of Mars was by Mariner 4 in 1964. Since that time, uncrewed spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System&#x27;s planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as for observation of the Earth. In August 2012, &quot;Voyager 1&quot; became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter interstellar space.

==Application==
Outer space has become an important element of global society. It provides multiple applications that are beneficial to the economy and scientific research.

The placing of artificial satellites in Earth orbit has produced numerous benefits and has become the dominating sector of the space economy. They allow relay of long-range communications like television, provide a means of precise navigation, and permit direct monitoring of weather conditions and remote sensing of the Earth. The latter role serves a variety of purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants and trees, and surveillance of military activities. They facilitate the discovery and monitoring of climate change influences. Satellites make use of the significantly reduced drag in space to stay in stable orbits, allowing them to efficiently span the whole globe, compared to for example stratospheric balloons or high-altitude platform stations, which have other benefits.

The absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13 billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. Not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust increases its effectiveness. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater on the far side of the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.
The deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes, such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces. Like asteroid mining, space manufacturing would require a large financial investment with little prospect of immediate return. An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $–$ per kg, according to a 2006 estimate (allowing for inflation since then). The cost of access to space has declined since 2013. Partially reusable rockets such as the Falcon 9 have lowered access to space below 3500 dollars per kilogram. With these new rockets the cost to send materials into space remains prohibitively high for many industries. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include, fully reusable launch systems, non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.

Interstellar travel for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility. The distances to the nearest stars mean it would require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades. For example, the Daedalus Project study, which proposed a spacecraft powered by the fusion of deuterium and helium-3, would require 36 years to reach the &quot;nearby&quot; Alpha Centauri system. Other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include light sails, ramjets, and beam-powered propulsion. More advanced propulsion systems could use antimatter as a fuel, potentially reaching relativistic velocities.

From the Earth&#x27;s surface, the ultracold temperature of outer space can be used as a renewable cooling technology for various applications on Earth through passive daytime radiative cooling. This enhances longwave infrared (LWIR) thermal radiation heat transfer through the amosphere&#x27;s infrared window into outer space, lowering ambient temperatures. Photonic metamaterials can be used to suppress solar heating.

<text>Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata (29 July 1904 – 29 November 1993) was an Indian industrialist, philanthropist, aviator and former chairman of Tata Group.

Born into the Tata family of India, he was the son of noted businessman Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata and his wife Suzanne Brière. He is best known for being the founder of several industries under the Tata Group, including Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors, Titan Industries, Tata Salt, Voltas and Air India. In 1982, he was awarded the French Legion of Honour and in 1955 and 1992, he received two of India&#x27;s highest civilian awards: the Padma Vibhushan and the Bharat Ratna. These honours were bestowed on him for his contributions to Indian industry.

== Early life ==

Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata was born on 29 July 1904 to an Indian Parsi family in Paris, France. He was the second child of businessman Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata and his French wife, Suzanne &quot;Sooni&quot; Brière. His father was the first cousin of Jamsetji Tata, a pioneer industrialist in India. He had one elder sister Sylla, a younger sister Rodabeh and two younger brothers Darab and Jamshed (called Jimmy) Tata. His sister, Sylla, was married to Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, the third baronet of Petits. His sister&#x27;s sister-in-law, Rattanbai Petit, was the wife of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who later became the founder of Pakistan in August 1947. 

As his mother was French, he spent much of his childhood in France and as a result, French was his first language. He attended the Janson De Sailly School in Paris. One of the teachers at that school mistaken him for being Egyptian and used to call him &quot;L&#x27;Egyptien&quot;. Tata&#x27;s family also purchased a house on the beach in Neufchâtel-Hardelot where the family would sometimes live until 1917. Tata was also neighbors with Louis Bleriot.

Tata attended the Cathedral and John Connon School, Bombay. In 1917 he and his family moved to Yokohama, Japan and lived there for two years while he attended an American school. When his father joined the Tata company he moved the whole family to London. During this time, J. R. D.&#x27;s mother died at the age of 43 while his father was in India and his family was in France.

After his mother&#x27;s death, Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata decided to move his family to India and sent J. R. D. back to England for higher studies in October 1923. He attended a grammar school, and later enrolled at Cambridge University and was interested in studying Engineering. 

However, as a citizen of France J. R. D. had to enlist in the French army for at least a year. In between grammar school and his time in the army, he spent a brief spell at home in Bombay. After joining the French Army he was posted into a regiment of spahis. Upon discovering Tata could not only read and write French and English, but could type as well, a colonel had him assigned as a secretary in his office. After his time in the French Army, Tata planned to return back to Cambridge and complete his studies, but his father decided to bring him back to India and he joined the Tata Company.

In 1929, Tata renounced his French citizenship and became an Indian citizen. In 1930 Tata married Thelma Vicaji, the niece of Jack Vicaji, a colourful lawyer whom he hired to defend him on a charge of driving his Bugatti too fast along Bombay&#x27;s main promenade, Marine Drive. Previously he had been engaged to Dinbai Mehta, the future mother of &quot;The Economist&quot; editor Shapur Kharegat.

While he was born to a Parsi father, and his French mother converted to Zoroastrianism, J. R. D. was agnostic. He found some Parsi religious customs like their funeral rites and their exclusiveness irksome. He adhered to the three basic tenets of Zoroastrianism, which were good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, but he did not profess belief or disbelief in God.

== Career ==
When Tata was in tour, he was inspired by his friend&#x27;s father, aviation pioneer Louis Blériot, the first man to fly across the English Channel, and took to flying. On 10 February 1929, Tata obtained the first license issued in India.
He later came to be known as the &quot;Father of Indian civil aviation&quot;. He founded India&#x27;s first commercial airline, Tata Airlines in 1932, which became Air India in 1946, now India&#x27;s national airline. He and Nevill Vintcent worked together in building Tata Airlines. They were also good friends. In 1929, J. R. D. became one of the first Indians to be granted a commercial&#x27;s license. In 1932 Tata Aviation Service, the forerunner to Tata Airline and Air India, took to the skies. That same year he flew the first commercial mail flight to Juhu, in a de Havilland Puss Moth.

The first flight in the History of Indian aviation lifted off from Drigh in Karachi to Madras with J. R. D. at the controls of a Puss on 15 October 1932. J. R. D. nourished and nurtured his airline baby through to 1953, when the government of Jawaharlal Nehru nationalised Air India along with several other private Airlines and appointed JRD as its first Chairman. JRD continued as chairman for 25 years before being removed by  Morarji Desai in 1978.

He joined Tata Sons as an unpaid apprentice in 1925. In 1938, at the age of 34, Tata was elected Chairman of Tata Sons making him the head of the largest industrial group in India. He took over as Chairman of Tata Sons from his second cousin Nowroji Saklatwala. For decades, he directed the huge Tata Group of companies, with major interests in steel, engineering, power, chemicals and hospitality. He was famous for succeeding in business while maintaining high ethical standards – refusing to bribe politicians or use the black market.

Under his chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$100 million to over US$5 billion. He started with 14 enterprises under his leadership and half a century later on 26 July 1988, when he left, Tata Sons was a conglomerate of 95 enterprises which they either started or in which they had controlling interest.

He was the trustee of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust from its inception in 1932 for over half a century. Under his guidance, this Trust established Asia&#x27;s first cancer facility, the Tata Memorial Centre for Cancer, Research and Treatment, Bombay in 1941. He also founded the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS, 1936), the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR, 1945), and the National Center for Performing Arts.

In 1945, he founded Tata Motors. In 1948, Tata launched Air India International as India&#x27;s first international airline. In 1953, the Indian Government appointed Tata as Chairman of Air India and a director on the Board of Indian Airlines – a position he retained for 25 years. For his crowning achievements in aviation, he was bestowed with the title of Honorary Air Commodore of India.

Tata cared greatly for his workers. In 1956, he initiated a programme of closer &#x27;employee association with management&#x27; to give workers a stronger voice in the affairs of the company. He firmly believed in employee welfare and espoused the principles of an eight-hour working day, free medical aid, workers&#x27; provident scheme, and workmen&#x27;s accident compensation schemes, which were later, adopted as statutory requirements in India.

He was also a founding member of the first Governing Body of NCAER, the National Council of Applied Economic Research in New Delhi, India&#x27;s first independent economic policy institute established in 1956. In 1968, he founded Tata Consultancy Services as Tata Computer Centre. In 1979, Tata Steel instituted a new practice: a worker being deemed to be &quot;at work&quot; from the moment he leaves home for work until he returns home from work. This made the company financially liable to the worker for any mishap on the way to and from work. In 1987, he founded Titan Industries. Jamshedpur was also selected as a UN Global Compact City because of the quality of life, conditions of sanitation, roads and welfare that were offered by Tata Steel.

=== Support of emergency powers in 1975 ===
Tata was also supportive of the declaration of emergency powers by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, in 1975. He is quoted to have told a reporter of the Times, &quot;things had gone too far. You can&#x27;t imagine what we&#x27;ve been through here—strikes, boycotts, demonstrations. Why, there were days I couldn&#x27;t walk out of my house into the streets. The parliamentary system is not suited to our needs.&quot;

== Awards and honours ==

Tata received a number of awards. He was conferred the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force in 1948, was promoted to the Air Commodore rank (equivalent to Brigadier in the army) on 4 October 1966, and was further promoted on 1 April 1974 to the Air Vice Marshal rank. Several international awards for aviation were given to him – the Tony Jannus Award in March 1979, the Gold Air Medal of the in 1985, the Edward Warner Award of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Canada in 1986 and the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1988. He received the Padma Vibhushan in 1955. The French Legion of Honour was bestowed on him in 1983. In 1992, because of his selfless humanitarian endeavours, Tata was awarded India&#x27;s highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna. In his memory, the Government of Maharashtra named its first double-decker bridge the &quot;Bharatratna JRD Tata Overbridge&quot; at Nasik Phata, Pimpri Chinchwad.

Following Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s 1975-1977 Emergency, in which she controversially pursued forced sterilizations as a form of population control, Tata built on these efforts by ordering Tata Steel to open nine family planning centers in 1984. Employees and their non-employee partners were compensated for undergoing sterilization, and factory plant departments were awarded for achieving the lowest fertility rate. While such incentives arguably violated the medical ethics principle of personal bodily autonomy, Tata was awarded the 1992 United Nations Population Award for his efforts. 

==Death ==
Tata died in Geneva, Switzerland of a kidney infection on 29 November 1993, at the age of 89. He said a few days before his death: &quot;Comme c&#x27;est doux de mourir&quot; (&quot;How gentle it is to die&quot;).

Upon his death, the Indian Parliament was adjourned in his memory, an honour not usually given to persons who are not members of parliament. He was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

In 2012, Tata was ranked the sixth &quot;The Greatest Indian&quot; in an &quot;Outlook magazine&quot; poll, &quot;conducted in conjunction with CNN-IBN and History18 Channels with BBC.&quot;

<text>David McDowell Brown (April 16, 1956 – February 1, 2003) was a United States Navy captain and NASA astronaut. He died on his first spaceflight, when the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; (STS-107) disintegrated during orbital reentry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Brown became an astronaut in 1996 but had not served on a space mission prior to the &quot; Columbia&quot; disaster. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

==Education==
* Graduated from McKinley Elementary, Arlington, Virginia
* Graduated from Swanson Middle, Arlington, Virginia
* 1974: Graduated from Yorktown High School, Arlington, Virginia
* 1978: Received bachelor of science degree in biology from the College of William &amp; Mary
* 1982: Received a doctorate in medicine from Eastern Virginia Medical School

==Organizations==
* Active in the Boy Scouts of America, where Brown achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout.
* Past President, International Association of Military Flight Surgeon Pilots
* Associate Fellow, Aerospace Medical Association
* Society of U.S. Naval Flight Surgeons.

==Military career==
Brown joined the U.S. Navy after his internship at the Medical University of South Carolina. Upon completion of flight surgeon training in 1984, Brown reported to the Navy Branch Hospital in Adak, Alaska, as Director of Medical Services. He was then assigned to Carrier Air Wing Fifteen which deployed aboard the aircraft carrier in the Western Pacific. In 1988, Brown became the only flight surgeon in a 10-year period to be chosen for pilot training. He was ultimately designated a Naval Aviator in 1990 at NAS Chase Field in Beeville, Texas, ranking number one in his class. Brown was then sent for training and carrier qualification in the A-6E Intruder. In 1991, he reported to the Naval Strike Warfare Center at NAS Fallon, Nevada, serving as a Strike Leader Attack Training Syllabus Instructor and a Contingency Cell Planning Officer. Brown was also qualified in the F/A-18 Hornet and deployed from Japan in 1992 aboard flying the A-6E with VA-115. In 1995, he reported to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland as their flight surgeon, where Brown also flew the T-38 Talon.

Brown logged over 2,700 flight hours with 1,700 in high-performance military aircraft. He was qualified as the first pilot in NASA T-38 aircraft and held a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued Technician Class amateur radio license with the call sign KC5ZTC.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in April 1996, Brown reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation and was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Brown was initially assigned to support payload development for the International Space Station, followed by the astronaut support team responsible for orbiter cockpit setup, crew strap-in, and landing recovery.

On April 21, 2001, Brown appeared on ESPN as an expert on g-force loading on the human body that led to the cancellation of the Firestone Firehawk 600 CART race.

Brown flew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; on STS-107, logging 15 days, 22 hours, and 20 minutes in space from January 16 to February 1, 2003. The flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. On February 1, 2003, all seven members &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s crew perished during reentry, 16 minutes before the scheduled landing.

==Personal life==

The only unmarried member of the STS-107 crew, Brown had previously been romantically involved with NASA engineer Ann Micklos. The couple ended their relationship shortly before the mission and remained close friends until his death. The crew of STS-107 had formed a close friendship during their training, and Brown had been preparing a video to commemorate this once they returned from the mission. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Laurel Blair Clark (née Salton; March 10, 1961 – February 1, 2003) was an American NASA astronaut, medical doctor, United States Navy captain, and Space Shuttle mission specialist. She died along with her six fellow crew members in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. Clark was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

==Early and personal life==
Clark was born in Ames, Iowa, but considered Racine, Wisconsin, her hometown. Clark was a member of the Gamma Phi Beta sorority at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and held a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued Technician Class amateur radio license with the call sign KC5ZSU.

Clark is survived by her husband fellow former U.S. Navy captain and NASA flight surgeon Dr. Jonathan Clark (who was part of an official NASA panel that prepared the final 400-page report about the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster), and son Iain who was born in 1996.

==Education==
*1979: Graduated from William Horlick High School, Racine, Wisconsin
*1983: Received Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison
*1987: Received doctorate in Medicine from the University of Wisconsin–Madison

==Organizations==
Clark was a member of the Aerospace Medical Association and the Society of U.S. Naval Flight Surgeons. She was also a member of the Olympia Brown Unitarian Universalist Church in Racine, Wisconsin.

==Military career==
During medical school, Clark did active duty training with the Diving Medicine Department at the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit in March 1987. After completing medical school, she underwent postgraduate medical education in pediatrics from 1987 to 1988 at the National Naval Medical Center. The following year, Clark completed Navy undersea medical officer training at the Naval Undersea Medical Institute in Groton, Connecticut, and diving medical officer training at the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center in Panama City, Florida. She was designated a Radiation Health Officer and Undersea Medical Officer. Clark was then assigned as the Submarine Squadron 14 Medical Department Head in Holy Loch, Scotland. During that assignment, she dove with Navy divers and Naval Special Warfare Unit Two SEALs and performed many medical evacuations from US submarines. After two years of operational experience, Clark was designated as a Naval Submarine Medical Officer and Diving Medical Officer.

Clark underwent six months of aeromedical training at the Naval Aerospace Medical Institute at NAS Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida, and was designated as a Naval Flight Surgeon. She was stationed at MCAS Yuma, Arizona, and assigned as Flight Surgeon Marine Attack Squadron 211 (VMA-211), a Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier squadron. Clark made several deployments, including one overseas to the Western Pacific, practiced medicine in austere environments, and flew on multiple aircraft. Her squadron won the Marine Attack Squadron of the Year award for its successful deployment. Clark was then assigned as the Group Flight Surgeon for Marine Aircraft Group 13 (MAG-13).

Before her selection as an astronaut candidate, Clark served as a Flight Surgeon for Training Squadron 86 (VT-86), the Naval Flight Officer advanced training squadron for tactical jets at NAS Pensacola. She was Board Certified by the National Board of Medical Examiners and held a Wisconsin Medical License, and her military qualifications included Radiation Health Officer, Undersea Medical Officer, Diving Medical Officer, Submarine Medical Officer, and Naval Flight Surgeon. Clark was also a Basic Life Support Instructor, Advanced Cardiac Life Support Provider, Advanced Trauma Life Support Provider, and Hyperbaric Chamber Advisor.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in April 1996, Clark reported to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, in August 1996. After completing two years of training and evaluation, she was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. From July 1997 to August 2000, Clark worked in the Astronaut Office Payloads/Habitability Branch. She flew aboard STS-107, logging 15 days, 22 hours and 21 minutes in space.

===Space flight experience===

STS-107 &quot;Columbia&quot; – The 16-day flight was a dedicated science and research mission. Working 24 hours a day, in two alternating shifts, the crew successfully conducted approximately 80 experiments. Clark&#x27;s bioscience experiments included gardening in space, as she discussed only days before her death in an interview with Milwaukee media near her Wisconsin hometown. The STS-107 mission ended abruptly on February 1, 2003, when &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated and her crew perished during re-entry, 16 minutes before scheduled landing.

Clark also recorded inside the cockpit during &quot;Columbia&quot;″s descent into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on a small digital camera.

Clark&#x27;s final message to her friends and family was through an email sent from &quot;Columbia&quot;. In the released text of the email, Clark called the planet magnificent, and explained that while she spends much of the time working back in Spacehab and away from the sights of Earth, &quot;whenever I do get to look out, it is glorious.&quot; Clark found that taking photos of the Earth was challenging, &quot;Keeping my fingers crossed that they&#x27;re in sharp focus.&quot; Clark also shared some of the intriguing effects of micro gravity on human physiology, such as constant challenge to stay adequately hydrated due to an &quot;almost non-existent&quot; sense of thirst.

==Awards and decorations==
Clark was awarded numerous insignia and personal decorations including:

===Qualification insignia===
* Naval Astronaut/Flight Surgeon
* Naval Flight Surgeon
* Diving Medical Officer
* Submarine Medical Officer

===Personal decorations===

The † symbol indicates a posthumous award.

==Tributes==
* Asteroid 51827 Laurelclark was named for Clark.
*Clark Hill in the Columbia Hills on Mars was named for Clark.
* L. Clark, an interior crater of the lunar crater Apollo, was named for Clark.
* Clark Hall, in the Columbia Village Suites at the Florida Institute of Technology, is named after her. The apartments were initially planned to be named the Crane Creek Suites, but were renamed in 2008 to commemorate the &quot;Columbia&quot; crew.

<text>Michael Phillip Anderson (December 25, 1959 – February 1, 2003) was a United States Air Force officer and NASA astronaut. He and his six fellow crew members were killed in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster when the craft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Anderson served as the payload commander and lieutenant colonel in charge of science experiments on the &quot;Columbia&quot;. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

==Early life and education==
Michael Philip Anderson was born in Plattsburgh, New York on December 25, 1959, to Barbara and Bobbie Anderson. He was their third child and only son. Bobbie serviced jets at Plattsburgh Air Force Base in Plattsburgh and was transferred to Fairchild Air Force Base, about away from Spokane, Washington, which Anderson spoke of as his hometown. Anderson graduated from Cheney High School in Cheney, Washington, one of four African Americans in a class of 200 students.

In 1981, Anderson graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics and astronomy from the University of Washington in Seattle. In 1990, he earned a Master of Science degree in physics from Creighton University in Omaha.

==Air Force career==
Upon Anderson&#x27;s graduation from the University of Washington, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. After completing a year of technical training at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, Anderson was assigned to Randolph Air Force Base in Texas. At Randolph, he served as chief of communication maintenance for the 2015th Communication Squadron and later as director of information system maintenance for the 1920th Information System Group.

In 1986, Anderson was selected to attend Undergraduate Pilot Training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Upon graduation, he was assigned to the 2d Airborne Command and Control Squadron, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska as an EC-135 pilot, flying the Strategic Air Command&#x27;s airborne command post code-named &quot;Looking Glass.&quot; Anderson completed his master&#x27;s degree while stationed at Offutt.

From January 1991 to September 1992, Anderson served as an aircraft commander and instructor pilot in the 920th Air Refueling Squadron, Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan.

From September 1992 to February 1995, Anderson was assigned as an instructor pilot and tactics officer in the 380th Air Refueling Wing, Plattsburgh Air Force Base, New York.

Anderson logged more than 3,000 hours of flight time when NASA selected him for astronaut training in December 1994. Anderson was one of 19 candidates selected from a pool of 2,962 applicants.

==NASA==

Anderson reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. He completed a year of training and evaluation, and was qualified for flight crew assignment as a mission specialist. Anderson was initially assigned technical duties in the Flight Support Branch of the Astronaut Office, but went on to log more than 593 hours in space aboard two Space Shuttle missions.

===Space Shuttle missions===

==== &quot;Endeavour&quot; ====

STS-89 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (January 22–31, 1998). Anderson was a mission specialist on STS-89, the eighth Shuttle-to-Mir Space Station docking mission, during which the crew delivered over 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware, and water.

In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered Andy Thomas to Mir and returned with David Wolf. The mission&#x27;s duration was 8 days, 19 hours, and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth.

==== &quot;Columbia&quot; ====
STS-107 Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; (January 16–February 1, 2003). Anderson served as payload commander and lieutenant colonel in charge of science experiments on the &quot;Columbia&quot;, NASA&#x27;s oldest shuttle. On February 1, 2003, the shuttle was returning to Earth after a successful 16-day trip to orbit, where the crew had conducted more than 80 scientific experiments.

Unbeknownst to her crew, the orbiter had suffered critical damage during its launch on January 16, when foam from the fuel tank&#x27;s insulation fell off and tore a hole in &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; left wing. During re-entry, the hole allowed super-hot atmospheric gases to penetrate the orbiter&#x27;s wing, leading to its destruction. The mission&#x27;s duration was 15 days, 22 hours, and 20 minutes.

Along with the rest of the STS-107 crew, Anderson was killed upon reentry when the shuttle disintegrated over Texas. 

The &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board reported that, in addition to the &quot;Columbia&quot;″s physical damage, NASA&#x27;s management culture was partly responsible for the disaster.

==Quotes==
Prior to the final launch of the &quot;Columbia&quot;, Anderson told reporters: &quot;There&#x27;s always that unknown.&quot;

==Personal life==
Anderson had a wife, Sandra Hawkins, and two daughters, Kaycee and Sydney. He also had three sisters.

Anderson and his family lived in Houston at the time of his death, where they attended Grace Community Church. Anderson sang tenor in the church&#x27;s choir.

==Awards==


==Legacy and tributes==

*State Route 904, running through Cheney, Washington, where Anderson graduated from high school, was renamed in his memory.
*The science and math wing of Cheney High School is dedicated to his memory.
*Asteroid 51824 Mikeanderson was posthumously named after Anderson.
* Anderson Hall, in the Columbia Village apartments at the Florida Institute of Technology is named after him.
* Anderson Plaza, the green space in front of the Hixson-Lied Science Center at Creighton University was named after him in a compromise between the student body, who wanted the Science Center named for Anderson, and the administration who had already sold the naming rights to the Hixson-Lied family.
* Blair Elementary School on Fairchild Air Force Base in Washington was renamed Michael Anderson Elementary School in January 2004. Anderson attended the school as a fifth-grader.
* Avondale Elementary School in Avondale, Arizona was renamed Michael Anderson Elementary in his honor. He attended school there when he was in 3rd grade, and one of the school T-shirts was aboard the &quot;Columbia&quot; on its last voyage.
* In 2003, Anderson was inducted into the International Forest of Friendship, in Atchison, KS as part of a memorial to the &quot;Columbia&quot; astronauts.
* Anderson Park in Canton, Mississippi was dedicated in June 2004.
* An outdoor bronze statue of Anderson was unveiled in Spokane in June 2005. Larger-than-life, it was created by local artist Dorothy Fowler, and shows Anderson kneeling with his helmet in one hand and a dove in the other.
* A duplicate statue was dedicated at the Museum of Flight in Seattle in June 2009 and the museum launched an aerospace program in his honor.
* An outdoor mural in the city of Plattsburgh was unveiled in October 2020 honoring Michael P. Anderson. On July 4, 2021, the city of Plattsburgh held a dedication for the mural, where the Anderson family was given a key to the city and led the annual Independence Day parade.
* Lunar crater M. Anderson is named after him.
* The Creighton University Physics Department, from which Anderson received his master&#x27;s degree, maintains a statue and physics scholarship in his honor.

<text>Strange Days is the second studio album by the American rock band the Doors, released on September 25, 1967 by Elektra Records, arriving eight months after their self-titled debut album. After the latter&#x27;s successful release, the band started experimenting with both new and old material in early 1967 for their second record. Upon release, &quot;Strange Days&quot; reached number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and eventually earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It contains two Top 30 hit singles, &quot;People Are Strange&quot; and &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot;.

Despite the album&#x27;s failure to match the success of its predecessor, it was &quot;arguably the one the band itself most appreciated musically and creatively&quot;, according to author David V. Moskowitz. Music journalist Stephen Davis considers &quot;Strange Days&quot; the best Doors album and &quot;one of the great artifacts of the rock movement.&quot;

==Recording and concept==

&quot;Strange Days&quot; was recorded during tour breaks between May and August 1967 at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood (the same studio as their first LP). In contrast to the 1966 sessions, producer Paul A. Rothchild and engineer Bruce Botnick employed a then cutting-edge 8-track recording machine. The protracted sessions allowed the band to experiment in the studio and further augment their sound with unusual instrumentation and sonic manipulation. Botnick said that the Doors were determined to pursue &quot;new techniques of recording. No holds barred.&quot;

Unlike &quot;The Doors&quot;, &quot;Strange Days&quot; incorporates various instruments, ranging from marimba to Moog synthesizer, which has been described as one of the first uses of the synth in rock music history. The contribution of the synthesizer was programmed with the help of Paul Beaver and played by lead singer Jim Morrison. Session musician Doug Lubahn occasionally played bass during the recording of the album.

The band explored musique concrète techniques during the album&#x27;s recording sessions.
While recording &quot;Unhappy Girl&quot; for example, keyboardist Ray Manzarek played his keyboard introduction backwards, and the corresponding overdubs were later made. On the track &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot;, Botnick took the white noise of a tape recorder and varied the speed by hand-winding it (resulting in a sound akin to wind) as the four band members played a variety of instruments in unusual ways. Further varispeed was then employed to create different timbres and effects.

== Composition ==
&quot;Strange Days&quot; has been described alternately by music critics as acid rock, psychedelic pop, psychedelic rock, or simply psychedelia; Barney Hoskyns labeled it as &quot;post-psychedelic pop&quot;. Several of the album&#x27;s songs had been written around the same time as the ones that appeared on &quot;The Doors&quot;. Two (&quot;My Eyes Have Seen You&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;) had been demoed in 1965 at Trans World Pacific Studios before Robby Krieger joined the group; indeed, the latter had been conceived by Morrison prior to his fateful reunion with Manzarek in the summer of 1965. Although the song was attempted twice during the sessions for the band&#x27;s debut, both versions were deemed unsatisfactory. A conventional blues arrangement, &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; features a defining slightly off-beat rhythm and Krieger&#x27;s bottleneck guitar, which create an eerie sound.

The LP&#x27;s first single, &quot;People Are Strange&quot;, was composed in early 1967 after Krieger, drummer John Densmore, and a depressed Morrison had walked to the top of Laurel Canyon. Densmore recalled the song&#x27;s writing process in his book &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;: Densmore and Krieger, who had then been roommates, were visited by a seemingly dejected Morrison. At the suggestion of Densmore, they took a walk along Laurel Canyon. Morrison returned from the walk &quot;euphoric&quot; with the early lyrics of &quot;People Are Strange&quot;.

Although Morrison was the Doors&#x27; primary songwriter, Krieger wrote several of the group&#x27;s hit singles, with his first composition being &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. His bluesy &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; was about a soldier/sailor on his last day with his girlfriend before shipping out, ostensibly to war. Manzarek said lyrically the song can be about &quot;lust and loss, or multiple orgasms, I&#x27;m not sure which.&quot; Manzarek played the final version of this song on a harpsichord, which Manzarek described as &quot;a most elegant instrument that one does not normally associate with rock and roll.&quot; It was edited to a 2:37 length and released as the second single (after &quot;People Are Strange&quot;) from the album, and reached No. 25 on the charts in the US. Upon release, &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; was considered to be somewhat risqué for radio airplay, and was banned in New Haven, Connecticut, for being &quot;too controversial&quot;, much to the dismay of the band.

&quot;Horse Latitudes&quot; showcases Morrison&#x27;s spoken-word poetry, who confirmed that he penned the poem during his high school years. However, Manzarek had mentioned that he never believed he wrote &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot; at such a young age, claiming the words were &quot;too mature&quot;. The album concludes with the 11 minute-long epic, &quot;When the Music&#x27;s Over&quot;, whose keyboard part was inspired by Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;.

== Release and packaging ==
&quot;Strange Days&quot; was released on September 25, 1967, by Elektra Records. Although the album was quite successful, reaching No. 3 in the United States during a sixty-three-week chart stay in November 1967, its impact was attenuated by the enduring success of the band&#x27;s debut album, which remained in the Top Ten over ten months after its release during a 122-week stay. According to music journalist Stephen Davis, &quot;Strange Days&quot; also proved to be the Doors&#x27; &quot;worst-selling album&quot; in their career with Morrison.

The album cover of &quot;Strange Days&quot;, photographed by Joel Brodsky, depicts a group of street performers in New York. The location of the photograph is at Sniffen Court, a residential alley next to East 36th Street between Lexington and Third Avenue in Manhattan. Actual street performers could not be located for all of the designated roles, so Brodsky&#x27;s assistant stood in as a juggler while a random cab driver was paid $5 to pose playing the trumpet. Twin dwarfs were hired, with one appearing on the front cover and the other appearing on the back cover, which is the other half of the same photo on the front cover. However, a group shot of the band does appear on a poster in the background of both covers, bearing captions of the band and album name. (The same photograph previously appeared on the back cover of the band&#x27;s debut album.) Because of the subtlety of the artist and album title, most record stores put stickers across the cover to help customers identify it more clearly.
== Critical reception ==
Apart from its lower commercial performance compared to &quot;The Doors&quot;, contemporary reviews for &quot;Strange Days&quot; were generally positive. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined that the album &quot;has all the power and energy of the first LP, but is more subtle, more intricate and much more effective&quot; and argued that the &quot;whole album, individual songs and especially the final track are constructed in the five parts of tragedy. Like Greek drama, you know when the music&#x27;s over because there is catharsis.&quot; Gene Youngblood of &quot;L.A. Free Press&quot; wrote a glowing review, noting the Doors musical style as a &quot;more surreal than psychedelic, it is more anguish than acid.&quot; Robert Christgau called the album &quot;muscular but misshapen&quot; in a May 1968 column for &quot;Esquire&quot;, but went on to write that the Doors had come &quot;from nowhere to reign as America&#x27;s heaviest group&quot;.

Retrospective reviews to the album have been equally favourable.
In 2007, on the occasion of the release of the 40th anniversary edition, Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, argued that &quot;while &quot;The Doors&quot; had more frequent, obvious peaks, the quirky &quot;Strange Days&quot; is a more ambitious, unified work. There are fewer filler tracks and each song carries as much weight as the one before and after it&quot; and called it &quot;a document of a sometimes beautiful, sometimes scary, and often twisted era of fear and idealism.&quot; It has also been ranked highly in lists; in 2012, the record was listed at No. 409 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and the same magazine included it on their 2007 list &quot;The 40 Essential Albums of 1967&quot;. &quot;Strange Days&quot; was placed in the twentieth position on &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top 25 Psychedelic Rock Albums&quot;, while &quot;Q&quot; magazine ranked it 35th on their respective list.

Some critics feel it does not quite match up to its predecessor. &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; wrote, &quot;With the exceptions of hard blues, &#x27;Love Me Two Times,&#x27; and the rock tango, &#x27;Moonlight Drive,&#x27; &quot;Strange Days&quot; didn&#x27;t have the power of &quot;The Doors&quot;&quot;. In his retrospective AllMusic review of the album, Richie Unterberger notes, &quot;Many of the songs on &quot;Strange Days&quot; had been written around the same time as the ones that appeared on &quot;The Doors&quot;, and with hindsight one has the sense that the best of the batch had already been cherry picked for the debut album. For that reason, the band&#x27;s second effort isn&#x27;t as consistently stunning as their debut,&quot; but he also expressed that overall &quot;it&#x27;s a very successful continuation of the themes of their classic album.&quot;

&quot;Strange Days&quot; and its songs influenced paintings by artist George Condo in 2023.

<text>Johann David Michaelis (27 February 1717 – 22 August 1791) was a German biblical scholar and teacher. He was member of a family that was committed to solid discipline in Hebrew and the cognate languages, which distinguished the University of Halle in the period of Pietism. He was a member of the Göttingen school of history.

==Life and work==

Michaelis was born on 27 February 1717 in Halle an der Saale. His Pietistic Lutheran family placed a great deal of importance in the study of Oriental languages in fulfilling the Church&#x27;s goal. He was trained for academic life under his father&#x27;s eye. At Halle he was influenced, especially in philosophy, by Siegmund J. Baumgarten (1706–1757), the link between the old Pietism and J. S. Semler, while he cultivated his strong taste for history under Chancellor Ludwig.

In 1739, he completed his doctoral dissertation, where he defended the antiquity and divine authority of the vowel points in Hebrew. His scholarship still moved along the old traditional lines, and he was also much exercised by certain religious scruples, with some seeing a conflict between his independent mind and that of submission to authority - encouraged by the Lutheranism in which he had been trained. He visited England and the Netherlands in 1741–1742. In Holland, he became acquainted with Albert Schultens, whose philological views would influence him. In 1745 he became an assistant professor (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;) of oriental languages at the Göttingen. In 1746 he became &quot;professor extraordinarius&quot; and in 1750 &quot;ordinarius&quot;. He remained in Göttingen until his death in 1791. From 1771-1785 he was editor of the &quot;Orientalische Und Exegetische Bibliothek&quot;.

One of his works was a translation of four parts of Samuel Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Clarissa&quot;; and translations of some of the then current English paraphrases on biblical books showed his sympathy with a school which attracted him by its freer air. His Oriental studies were reshaped by reading Schultens; for the Halle school, with all its learning, had no conception of the principles on which a fruitful connection between Biblical and Oriental learning could be established. His linguistic work was hampered by the lack of manuscript material, which is felt in his philological writings, e.g., in his valuable &quot;Supplementa&quot; to the Hebrew lexicons (1784–1792). He could not become such an Arabist as J. J. Reiske; and, though for many years the most famous teacher of Semitic languages in Europe, neither his grammatical nor his critical work has left a permanent mark, with the exception perhaps of his text-critical studies on the &quot;Peshitta&quot;. He had a particular interest for history, antiquities, and especially geography and natural science. He had in fact started his university course as a &quot;medicinae cultor&quot;, and in his autobiography he half regrets that he did not choose the medical profession. In geography he found a field hardly touched since Samuel Bochart, in whose footsteps he followed in the &quot;Spicilegium geographiae hebraeorum exterae post Bochartum&quot; (1769–1780).

Michaelis inspired the famous Danish Arabia Expedition (1761–67), conducted by Carsten Niebuhr and Peter Forsskål. The cuneiform inscriptions Niebuhr brought back from the expedition were the basis for the earliest attempts made to decipher cuneiform. In spite of his doctrinal writings—which at the time made no little noise, so that his &quot;Compendium of Dogmatic&quot; (1760) was confiscated in Sweden, and the Knighthood of the Polar Star was afterwards given him in reparation—it was the natural side of the Bible that really attracted him. Michaelis arguably contributed the most in introducing the method of studying Hebrew antiquity as an integral part of ancient Eastern life.

The personal character of Michaelis can be read between the lines of his autobiography with the aid of the other materials collected by J. M. Hassencamp (&quot;J. D. Michaelis Lebensbeschreibung&quot;, etc., 1793). The same volume contains a full list of his works. Besides those already mentioned it is sufficient to refer to his &quot;Introduction to the New Testament&quot; (the first edition, 1750, preceded the full development of his powers, and is a very different book from the later editions), his reprint of Robert Lowth&#x27;s &quot;Praelectiones&quot; with important additions (1758–1762), his German translation of the Bible with notes (1773–1792), his &quot;Orientalische und exegetische Bibliothek&quot; (1775–1785) and &quot;Neue O. und E. Bib.&quot; (1786–1791), his &quot;Mosaisches Recht&quot; (1770–1771) (quite influenced by Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;esprit des lois&quot; of 1748) and his edition of Edmund Castell&#x27;s &quot;Lexicon syriacum&quot; (1787–1788). His &quot;Litterarischer Briefwechsel&quot; (1794–1796) contains much that is interesting for the history of learning in his time.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1789.

==Family==
* Michaelis&#x27; great uncle Johann Heinrich Michaelis (1668–1738) was the chief director of A.H. Francke&#x27;s &quot;Collegium orientale theologicum&quot;, a practical school of Biblical and Oriental philology then quite unique, and the author of an annotated Hebrew Bible and various exegetical works of reputation, especially the &quot;Adnotationes uberiores in hagiographos&quot; (1720).
* Michaelis&#x27; daughter Luise Michaelis was briefly engaged to Gothic writer and philosopher Carl Grosse.
* In his chief publications J. H. Michaelis had as fellow-worker his sister&#x27;s son Christian Benedikt Michaelis (1680–1764), the father of Johann David, who was likewise influential as professor at the University of Halle, and a sound scholar, especially in Syriac.
* Michaelis&#x27; daughter Caroline played an important role in early German Romanticism as the wife of critic August Wilhelm von Schlegel and later of philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling.

<text>The Israeli Air Force (IAF; , commonly known as , &quot;Kheil HaAvir&quot;, &quot;Air Corps&quot;) operates as the aerial and space warfare branch of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). It was founded on May 28, 1948, shortly after the Israeli Declaration of Independence. , Aluf Tomer Bar has been serving as the Air Force commander.

The Israeli Air Force was established using commandeered or donated civilian aircraft and obsolete and surplus World War II combat aircraft. Eventually, more aircraft were procured, including Boeing B-17s, Bristol Beaufighters, de Havilland Mosquitoes and P-51D Mustangs. The Israeli Air Force played an important part in Operation Kadesh, Israel&#x27;s part in the 1956 Suez Crisis, dropping paratroopers at the Mitla Pass. On June 5, 1967, the first day of the Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force performed Operation Focus, debilitating the opposing Arab air forces and attaining air supremacy for the remainder of the war. 

Shortly after the end of the Six-Day War, Egypt initiated the War of Attrition, and the Israeli Air Force performed repeated bombings of strategic targets deep within enemy territory. When the Yom Kippur War broke out on October 6, 1973, Egyptian and Syrian advances forced the IAF to abandon detailed plans for the destruction of enemy air defences. Forced to operate under the missile and anti-aircraft artillery threats, the close air support it provided allowed Israeli troops on the ground to stem the tide and eventually go on the offensive.

Since that war most of Israel&#x27;s military aircraft have been obtained from the United States. Among these are the A-4 Skyhawk, F-4 Phantom II, F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-35 Lightning II. The Israeli Air Force has operated a number of domestically produced types such as the IAI Nesher, and later, the more advanced IAI Kfir. On June 7, 1981, eight IAF F-16s covered by six F-15s carried out Operation Opera to destroy the Iraqi nuclear facilities at Osiraq. On June 9, 1982, the Israeli Air Force carried out Operation Mole Cricket 19, crippling Syrian air defences in Lebanon. On October 1, 1985, In response to a PLO terrorist attack which murdered three Israeli civilians in Cyprus, the Israeli air force carried out Operation Wooden Leg, bombing the PLO Headquarters in Tunis. In 1991, the IAF carried out Operation Solomon which brought Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In 1993 and 1996, the IAF participated in Operation Accountability and Operation Grapes of Wrath, respectively. It has taken part in many operations since, including the 2006 Lebanon War, Operation Cast Lead, Operation Pillar of Cloud, Operation Protective Edge, Operation Guardian of the Walls and Operation Swords of Iron. On September 6, 2007, the Israeli Air Force successfully bombed an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor in Operation Orchard.

==Mission statement==

The Israeli Air Force states the following as its functions:
# To protect the State of Israel from aerial attack and to defend the IDF&#x27;s zone of operations
# To achieve air supremacy throughout the IDF&#x27;s zone of operation
# To participate in the fighting on both ground and sea
# To hit targets deep in enemy territory
# To create the aerial intelligence picture and participate in the creation of the general intelligence picture and its assessment
# To transport troops, equipment and weapons systems
# To carry out search, rescue and aerial evacuation missions
# To execute special operations
# To continually build and improve itself, as part of the general plan for improving the IDF and in accordance with the authority vested in it

==Insignia==
The insignia / roundel of the Israeli Air Force consists of a blue Star of David on a white circle. Aircraft usually carry it painted in six positions – on the top and bottom of each wing, and on each side of the fuselage. A low-visibility variant – a blue Star of David without the white circle – exists, although its use is extremely rare. Squadron markings usually go on the tail fin.

==History==
===Early years (1948–1967)===

Forerunners of the Israeli Air Force were Sherut Avir, the air wing of the Haganah, and the Palestine Flying Service established by the Irgun in 1937.
The Israeli Air Force formed on May 28, 1948, shortly after Israel declared statehood and found itself under attack. The force consisted of a hodge-podge of commandeered or donated civilian aircraft converted to military use. A variety of obsolete and surplus ex-World War II combat-aircraft were quickly sourced by various means to supplement this fleet. The backbone of the IAF consisted of 25 Avia S-199s purchased from Czechoslovakia, essentially Czechoslovak-built Messerschmitt Bf 109s, and 60 Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk IXEs, the first of which, &quot;Israel 1&quot;, was locally assembled from British abandoned spare parts and a salvaged engine from an Egyptian Air Force Spitfire, with most of the rest purchased from Czechoslovakia.

Israel&#x27;s new fighter-arm first went into action on May 29, 1948, assisting efforts to halt the Egyptian advance from Gaza northwards.

On May 30, after un-assembled planes were strafed on the ground at Ekron airfield, the fighters were moved to makeshift strip located around the current Herzliya Airport. The airfield was used as it was a bit back from the front-lines, and was clandestine since it was a purpose built strip, that was constructed after the beginning of hostilities, in between the orange orchards around Herzliya, and did not appear on published maps. The Israeli Air Force scored its first aerial victories on June 3 when Modi Alon, flying Avia D.112, shot down two Egyptian Air Force DC-3s which had just bombed Tel Aviv. The first dogfight against enemy fighters took place a few days later, on June 8, when Gideon Lichtaman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. 

During these initial operations, the squadron operated with a few planes versus almost complete Arab theater air supremacy. The airplanes were parked dispersed between the orange trees. The fighters were moved in October to Hatzor Airbase from the Herzliya strip due to its unsuitability in rainy conditions, probable loss of clandestine status, moving front lines which made former British bases safe for use, and a shift in the balance of air superiority towards the Israelis.

===Suez Crisis (1956)===
The Israeli Air Force played an important part in Operation Kadesh, Israel&#x27;s part in the 1956 Suez Crisis. At the launch of the operation, on October 29, Israeli P-51D Mustangs, some using their propeller blades, severed telephone lines in the Sinai. 16 IAF DC-3s – escorted by fighters – dropped Israeli paratroopers behind Egyptian lines at the Mitla Pass and Et-Tur. The Israeli Air Force conducted attacks on Egyptian ground units and assisted the Israeli Navy in capturing the Egyptian Navy destroyer &quot;Ibrahim el Awal&quot;, which had bombarded the Israeli city of Haifa – an airstrike damaged the Egyptian ship&#x27;s engines, enabling Israeli ships to reach it and capture it.
===Six-Day War (1967)===
In three hours on the morning of June 5, 1967, the first day of the Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force executed Operation Focus, crippling the opposing Arab air forces and attaining air supremacy for the remainder of the war. In a surprise attack, the IAF destroyed most of the Egyptian Air Force while its planes were still on the ground. By the end of the day, with surrounding Arab countries drawn into the fighting, the IAF had mauled the Syrian and Jordanian air forces, striking as far as Iraq. After six days of fighting, Israel claimed a total of 452 Arab aircraft destroyed, of which 49 were aerial victories.

After the IAF&#x27;s impressive performance in the Six-Day War, the Lyndon Johnson administration decided to sell F-4 Phantom fighters to Israel in 1968, marking the first sale of American military equipment to Israel.

===War of Attrition===
Shortly after the end of the Six-Day War, Egypt initiated the War of Attrition, hoping to prevent Israel from consolidating its hold over the lands captured in 1967. Israel&#x27;s goal in the fighting was to exact heavy losses on the opposing side, in order to facilitate a ceasefire. The Israeli Air Force undertook repeated bombings of strategic targets deep within enemy territory and repeatedly challenged Arab air forces for aerial supremacy, while supporting operations by Israel&#x27;s ground and naval forces. 

In late 1969 the Soviet Union began to deploy fighter aircraft units and surface-to-air missile units to Egypt. The Soviet surface-to-air missile units soon joined their Egyptian allies in direct confrontations with Israeli aircraft. Soviet fighters conducted patrols, but Israeli pilots were ordered not to engage them. On July 30, 1970, the tension peaked: An IAF ambush resulted in a large scale air brawl between IAF planes and MiGs flown by Soviet pilots—five MiGs were shot down, while the IAF suffered no losses. 

Fear of further escalation and superpower involvement brought the war to a conclusion. By the end of August 1970, the Israeli Air Force had claimed 111 aerial kills while reporting losing only four aircraft to Arab fighters. Egyptian and Soviet forces claimed to shoot down approximately 20 Israeli Air Force planes with surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery units.

=== Yom Kippur War (1973) ===

On October 6, 1973, with war imminent, the IAF began preparing for a pre-emptive strike against Egyptian and Syrian airfields and anti-aircraft positions. The Israeli government decided against pre-emption. IAF aircraft were therefore in the process of re-armament to the air-to-air role when Yom Kippur War hostilities began at 14:00. The next morning began with Operation Tagar, a SEAD offensive against Egyptian air defences, beginning with strikes against Egyptian air bases. &quot;Tagar&quot; was quickly discontinued when the dire situation on the Golan Heights became apparent.

IAF efforts were redirected north, where the ill-fated Operation Model 5 was carried out. Flying with outdated intelligence and no electronic screening against mobile SAM batteries and heavy flak, 6 IAF Phantoms were lost. The sustained campaign required to defeat enemy air defences was abandoned in the face of Egyptian and Syrian advances and the IAF was forced to operate under the SAM threat. Nevertheless, the close air support it provided allowed Israeli troops on the ground to stem the tide and eventually go on the offensive, first in the north and later in the south.

After the failure of the Israeli counter-offensive in the Sinai on October 8, the southern front remained relatively static and the IAF focused its attention on the Syrian front. While A-4 Skyhawks provided much needed support to troops on the ground, at the cost of 31 aircraft by the end of fourth day of the war, IAF Phantoms repeatedly struck Syrian air fields. Following Syrian FROG-7 strikes on military and civilian targets in northern Israel, the IAF initiated a campaign to destroy the infrastructure on which Syria&#x27;s war-making capacity depended, targeting strategic targets in Syria such as its oil industry and electricity generating system. By October 13 the Syrians had been pushed back and beyond their initial lines, Damascus had come within range of Israeli artillery and an Iraqi armored brigade, the vanguard of its expeditionary force, was destroyed.

On October 14 the Egyptian army launched an offensive along the entire front but was repulsed by the IDF. Israel followed on this success by attacking at the seam between the 2nd and 3rd Egyptian armies and crossing the Suez Canal into Egypt. Israeli forces fanned north and south, destroying Egyptian rear units and punching holes through its air defence array. This allowed the IAF the freedom of action it was previously denied and renewed attacks led to the collapse of the Egyptian Air Defence Force. This prompted increased diplomatic activity to resolve the war, coupled with increased activity by the Egyptian Air Force. From about October 18 to the end of the war, intensive air battles took place between Israeli and Egyptian aircraft.

Official Israeli Air Force losses of the Yom Kippur War were 102 aircraft, including 32 F-4 Phantoms, 53 A-4 Skyhawks, 11 Dassault Mirages, and 6 IAI Sa&#x27;ars, although other accounts suggest as many as 128 Israeli aircraft were lost. 91 air force personnel, of which 53 were airmen, were killed. 172 Egyptian aircraft were shot down in air-to-air combat, for a loss of between 5 and 21 for the Israelis, on all fronts. No official numbers were released on the Arab side, though total Egyptian losses were between 235 and 242 aircraft. Syria lost between 135 and 179.

===Expansion (1973–1982)===
Since the war, most of Israel&#x27;s military aircraft have been obtained from the United States. Among these are the F-4 Phantom II, A-4 Skyhawk, F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Israeli Air Force has operated a number of domestically produced types such as the IAI Nesher, and later, the more advanced IAI Kfir, which were derivatives of the French Dassault Mirage 5. The Kfir was adapted to utilize a more powerful U.S. engine, produced under license in Israel. On July 4, 1976, four Israeli C-130 Hercules transport aircraft secretly flew to Entebbe Airport for a rescue operation. In March 1978, the Israeli Air Force participated in Operation Litani.

On June 7, 1981, eight IAF F-16A fighters covered by six F-15A jets carried out Operation Opera to destroy the Iraqi nuclear facilities at Osiraq. Among the pilots who took part in the attack was Ilan Ramon, later Israel&#x27;s first astronaut.

=== 1982 Lebanon War and aftermath ===

Prior to the 1982 Lebanon War, Syria, with the help of the Soviet Union, had built up an overlapping network of surface-to-air missiles in Lebanon&#x27;s Beqaa Valley. On June 9, 1982, the IAF carried out Operation Mole Cricket 19, crippling the Syrian air defence array. In subsequent aerial battles against the Syrian Air Force, the IAF managed to shoot down 86 Syrian aircraft without losing a single fighter plane in an air-to-air combat. IAF AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships destroyed dozens of Syrian armored fighting vehicles and other ground targets, including some T-72 main battle tanks.

In the decades since the war&#x27;s official conclusion (including the conflict that followed), the IAF has regularly conducted air strikes against targets in Southern Lebanon, namely Hezbollah positions. 

On October 1, 1985, the IAF carried out Operation Wooden Leg, which involved the bombing of the PLO Headquarters near Tunis. This was the longest combat mission ever undertaken by the IAF, traversing 2,300 kilometers.

===1990s and beyond===

In 1991, the IAF carried out Operation Solomon which brought Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In 1993 and 1996, the IAF participated in Operation Accountability and Operation Grapes of Wrath, respectively.

In the late 1990s, the IAF began acquiring the F-15I Ra&#x27;am (Thunder) and the F-16I Sufa (Storm), manufactured specially for Israel according to IAF requirements. The first of 102 F-16I Sufas arrived in April 2004, joining an F-16 fleet that had already been the largest outside the US Air Force. The IAF also purchased the advanced Israeli air-to-air missile Rafael Python 5, with full-sphere capability, as well as a special version of the Apache Longbow, designated AH-64DI or Saraph. In 2005 the Israeli Air Force received modified Gulfstream V jets (&quot;Nachshon&quot;), equipped with advanced intelligence systems made by Israel Military Industries. By 2013 Israel became the world&#x27;s largest exporter of drones. In December 2016, Israel received its first pair of F-35 Lightning II from the United States.

Three months after the assassination of the leader of Hezbollah, Abbas al-Musawi, the IAF launched an offensive across South Lebanon with five air raids in six days. Some of the targets struck were as far north as Baalbek. On the final day, 26 May 1992, there were more than 40 missile strikes. Over 20 civilians were killed during the attacks.

The Israeli Air Force took an extensive part in IDF operations during the al-Aqsa Intifada, including the controversial targeted killings of Palestinian terrorist leaders, most notably Salah Shakhade, Ahmed Yassin and Abed al-Aziz Rantissi. While this policy was criticized due to the collateral damage caused in certain instances, Israel claims it is vital in its fight against terrorism and that IAF pilots do whatever they can to avoid civilian casualties, including aborting strikes. In 2007, Israel achieved a civilian casualty ratio of 1:30, or one civilian casualty for every thirty combatant casualties, in its airstrikes on militants in the Palestinian territories. Alan Dershowitz noted that &quot;No army in history has ever had a better ratio of combatants to civilians killed in a comparable setting&quot;.

===2006 Lebanon War===

The IAF played a critical role in the 2006 Lebanon War. IAF strikes—mainly, though not exclusively, in southern Lebanon—were aimed at stopping rocket launches by Hezbollah&#x27;s militia targeting Israeli towns. The IAF flew more than 12,000 combat missions during this war. The most notable, taking place during the second day of the war, resulted in the IAF destroying 59 Iranian-supplied medium- and long-range missile launchers in just 34 minutes. 

Widespread condemnation followed the July 30 IAF airstrike on a building suspected to be a militant hideout near the village of Qana, in which 28 civilians were killed. Hezbollah shot down an IAF CH-53 Yas&#x27;ur helicopter on the last day of the war, killing five crew members. Israeli aircraft shot down three of Hezbollah&#x27;s Iranian-made aerial drones during the conflict.

===2007 Operation Outside the Box===

In the 2007 Operation Outside the Box, the Israeli Air Force attacked a suspected Syrian nuclear weapons site. The IAF used electronic warfare (EW) system to neutralize Syria&#x27;s air defenses, feeding them a false sky-picture while IAF jets crossed much of Syria, bombed their targets and returned to Israel unchallenged.

===Operations in Gaza===

Since Hamas&#x27; takeover of Gaza in 2007, the Israeli Air Force has taken part in repeated bouts of violence between Israel and the Hamas-held Gaza Strip. In December 2008, the IAF spearheaded Operation Cast Lead, carrying out more than 2,360 air strikes. It had a principal role in destroying Hamas targets, and killed several senior Hamas commanders, including Said Seyam, Nizar Rayan, Tawfik Jaber, and Abu Zakaria al-Jamal.

According to a CBS news report, in January 2009 Israeli planes struck a convoy of trucks in Sudan headed for Egypt and carrying weapons apparently meant for the Gaza Strip. Seventeen trucks were bombed, and thirty-nine smugglers were killed in the strike. On April 5, 2011, a car driving from Port Sudan Airport to Port Sudan was destroyed by a missile. Both passengers were killed. one of whom may have been a senior Hamas military commander. The Sudanese Foreign Minister blamed the attack on Israel. Sudanese newspapers reported that Israeli aircraft attacked Gaza-bound arms convoys again in late 2011. On October 24, 2012, Sudan claimed that Israel had bombed a munitions factory south of Khartoum.

The Israeli Air Force also operates surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery units. Since 1990 their primary role has been the interception of surface-to-surface missiles and rockets fired into Israel. In 2011 the IAF began operating the &#x27;Iron Dome&#x27; anti-rocket missile system, which within a year had successfully intercepted and destroyed 93 rockets fired at Israeli towns from Gaza.

In November 2012, the IAF participated in Operation Pillar of Defense, during which, according to the IDF Spokesperson, Israeli forces targeted more than 1,500 military sites in Gaza Strip, including rocket launching pads, smuggling tunnels, command centers, and weapons manufacturing and storage facilities. Many of these attacks were carried out by the Air Force.

Between July 8 and August 5, 2014, the IAF participated in Operation Protective Edge, during which, according to the IDF Spokesperson, Israeli forces targeted 4,762 terror sites across the Gaza Strip, including rocket launching sites, command and control centers, military administration facilities, weapons storage and manufacturing facilities and training and military compounds.

In May 2021, Israeli artillery and air force carried out 1,500 strikes on Gaza during Operation Guardian of the Walls. Starting in October 2023, the Israeli Air Force fulfilled a main role in the war against Hamas.

===Syrian Civil War===
The civil war raging within Israel&#x27;s northern neighbor, has occasionally witnessed activity by the IAF, some overt, some unacknowledged and some merely attributed. Notable actions include:
* The downing of a Syrian Air Force Sukhoi Su-24 on September 23, 2014: The aircraft was shot down by an IAF MIM-104 Patriot air defense battery, after allegedly crossing the Syrian-Israeli ceasefire line during a ground attack mission against Syrian opposition forces.
* On August 20 and 21, 2015, after four rockets hit the Golan Heights and Upper Galilee, Israel launched airstrikes in Syria, killing several militants.
* The March 2017 Israeli airstrikes in Syria: On March 17, 2017, Israeli jet fighters attacked targets in Syria. Several S-200 missiles were fired at the jets, and one missile was shot down by an Arrow 2 missile; no aircraft were damaged. The incident was the first clearly confirmed Israeli strike on Syrian territory during the Syrian Civil War.
* On February 10, 2018, an Israeli AH-64 shot down an Iranian drone that entered Israel. 4 Israeli F-16&#x27;s launched a strike into Syria while remaining in Israeli airspace, reportedly to strike Iranian drone control facilities, conducting a cross-border raid. One of the F-16s was shot down by Syrian surface to air missiles and crashed in northern Israel, the first Israeli jet to be shot down in combat since 1982. Both pilots managed to eject in Israeli territory. The pilots were injured but walked out of hospital around a week later. Israel subsequently attacked Syrian air defenses and Iranian targets.
* On May 10, 2018, after Iranian elite forces on the Syrian-held side of the Golan Heights fired around 20 rockets towards Israeli army positions without causing damage or injuries, Israel responded with rounds of rocket fire into Syria. The Israeli Air Force confirmed the strikes. Twenty-three fighters, among them 18 foreigners, were killed. IAF commander Amikam Norkin said Israel used its F-35 stealth fighters for the first time.
* On September 17, 2018, Syrian media reported several explosions over the city of Latakia after allegedly intercepting missiles fired from the Mediterranean Sea. Israel assumed responsibility for the attack on Latakia, following the shoot down of a Russian reconnaissance plane by Syrian air defense systems. SANA news agency claimed ten people were injured by the Israeli attack. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported two Syrian soldiers died, while 113 Iranian soldiers have been killed during the past month as a result of Israeli strikes in Syria.

===2023–2024 Gaza war===
In the Israel–Gaza war beginning in October 2023, the IAF played a major role through its bombing of Gaza and subsequent support for ground troops in the ensuing invasion of the Gaza Strip.

==Pilot selection and training==
Thirty nine Israeli pilots have been credited with ace status, having shot down at least 5 enemy aircraft. Of these, 10 have shot down at least eight jet planes. The top ranking Israeli ace is Colonel Giora Epstein, who shot down seventeen enemy planes. Epstein holds the world record for jet aircraft shot down, and the most aircraft of any type shot down since the Korean War.

Israel Defence Forces had until 1995 denied women the opportunity to become pilots. In 1995, civilian pilot and aeronautical engineer Alice Miller successfully petitioned the Israel High Court of Justice to take the Israeli Air Force pilot training exams, after being rejected on grounds of gender. The court in 1996 eventually ruled that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller would not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF roles. After the prohibition had been lifted, the first female graduate was F-16 navigator &quot;Shari&quot; in 1998, followed three years later by Roni Zuckerman, the first female jet fighter pilot in IAF history.

===Ranks===
IAF ranks are identical to other Israel Defense Forces ranks. The rank insignia are identical except for the use of silver against a dark blue background. The service&#x27;s most senior-ranking active officer is the air force commander, which is the billet of a major general (&quot;aluf&quot;), and reports directly to the IDF Chief of Staff.

<text>Albert Schultens (; 1686 – 26 January 1750) was a Dutch philologist.

==Biography==
He was born at Groningen, where he studied for the church. He went on to the University of Leiden, applying himself specially to Hebrew and the cognate tongues. His thesis &quot;Dissertatio theologico-philologica de utilitate linguae Arabicae in interpretenda sacra lingua&quot; (&quot;The Use of Arabic in the Interpretation of Scripture&quot;) appeared in 1706. After a visit to Reland in Utrecht, he returned to Groningen (1708); then, having taken his degree in theology (1709), he returned to Leiden, and devoted himself to the study of the manuscript collections there until 1711, when he became pastor at Wassenaer.

He disdained parochial work and decided to accept the Hebrew chair at Franeker in 1713. He held this position until 1729, when he was transferred to Leiden as rector of the &quot;collegium theologicum&quot;, or seminary for poor students. From 1732 until his death (at Leiden) he was professor of Oriental languages at Leiden.

Schultens was the chief teacher of the Arabic language in the whole of the Europe during his lifetime. In some sense, he revived Arabic studies. He differed from J. J. Reiske and Silvestre de Sacy in regarding Arabic as a handmaid to Hebrew. Reiske considered Schultens&#x27; treatment of Arabic to be of little value, also maintaining that Arabic studies should not be taught as part of theology, but as a subject matter in its own right, as was mathematics, physics, geography and medicine. Schultens vindicated the value of comparative study of the Semitic tongues against those who, like Jacques Gousset, regarded Hebrew as a sacred tongue with which comparative philology has nothing to do.

His principal works were &quot;Institutiones ad Fundumenta Linguæ Hebraicæ&quot; (1737), &quot;Origines Hebraeae&quot; (2 vols., 1724, 1738), a second edition of which, with the &quot;De defectibus linguae Hebraeae&quot; (1731), appeared in 1761; &quot;Job&quot; (1737); &quot;Proverbs&quot; (1748); &quot;Vetus et regia via hebraezandi&quot; (1738); and &quot;Monumenta vetustiora Arabum&quot; (1740). He left unfinished &quot;Institutiones Aramææ&quot; (1745–49).

<text>Armadillo Aerospace was an aerospace startup company based in Mesquite, Texas. Its initial goal was to build a crewed suborbital spacecraft capable of space tourism, and it had also stated long-term ambitions of orbital spaceflight. The company was founded by John Carmack, co-founder and former chief technical officer of id Software.

On October 24, 2008, Armadillo won $350,000 by succeeding in the Level 1 Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge. On September 12, 2009, Armadillo won $500,000 by succeeding in Level 2 of the same challenge.

In 2010, they signed an exclusive deal with Space Adventures. Armadillo Aerospace was to provide a suborbital rocket to fly tourists into space, while Space Adventures would sell tickets for the experience.

In August 2013, Carmack announced that Armadillo Aerospace had been put in &quot;hibernation mode&quot;, following setbacks including the crash of the STIG-B rocket in January 2013.

In May 2014, several former employees of Armadillo Aerospace formed a new company, Exos Aerospace, which was created to carry their former company&#x27;s research into reusable commercial spacecraft. The new company set up their operations in one of Armadillo&#x27;s former facilities at the Caddo Mills Municipal Airport, in Texas.
Exos completed acquisition of Armadillo assets in early 2015, and intended to begin launches of the Suborbital Active Rocket with Guidance (SARGE) in 2016 from Spaceport America in New Mexico. SARGE will be an enhanced Armadillo STIG-B. The first flight of SARGE took place in 2018 from Spaceport America.

In September 2017, John Carmack retweeted a post about SpaceX rocket bloopers, along with his post &quot;I showed all of our crashes at the beginning of Armadillo Aerospace, but everyone thought it was a terrible idea and talked me out of it.&quot; In the comment section, one person asked if there&#x27;s chance of comeback for Armadillo Aerospace. He subsequently replied that there is the chance that he might &quot;want to try at some point&quot; with his own scheme, giving a sign that Armadillo Aerospace could someday return from hibernation mode.

==Research and development principles==

The company placed a strong emphasis on a rapid build and test cycle. Armadillo Aerospace designed and built more than 12 vehicles which used about 50 engine designs for over 100 rocket flights. Each design had several features in common. One was the use of modern computer technologies and electronics to simplify rocket control and reduce development costs. Another was the use of liquid propellants and VTVL to facilitate short launch-to-launch times.

==Prize competitions==

===X-Prize competition===
The company was a competitor for the Ansari X-Prize. Armadillo&#x27;s X-Prize vehicle was unorthodox among modern rockets in that instead of using stabilization fins, which complicate the design and increase drag, Armadillo used an aerodynamically unstable design, where the computer controlled jet vanes based on feedback from fibre optic gyroscopes.
Armadillo stated a preference for simplicity and reliability over performance, which was evident in its choice of hydrogen peroxide (50% concentration in water) and methanol as a mixed monopropellant for the vehicle. A monopropellant-based engine requires only a single tank as well as greatly simplified plumbing and other hardware.

===Wirefly X-Prize Cup 2006===
Armadillo Aerospace competed in the 2006 X PRIZE Cup. Armadillo Aerospace was the only competitor in the Lunar Lander Challenge. The company took two similar vehicles, Pixel and Texel, to the event. The vehicles narrowly failed to win the Level 1 prize, after making three dramatic attempts totalling over 5 minutes in the air, finally crashing out on the final attempt. Persistent landing problems were the main cause of failure, with the undercarriage breaking several times, and landing slightly off the pad on one occasion due to guidance difficulties. These flights were a highlight of the Wirefly X-prize cup.

====Quad vehicle====

The quad vehicle design is pressure-fed in blow down mode from an initial pressure of 320 psi for level 1 (400 psi level 2). The roll thrusters are cross-fed by gas drawn from ullage space of the opposite tank. The vehicle is able to transfer propellant through connecting pipes between opposite tanks by controlling ullage pressures with the thrusters; this helps it balance, minimizing gas use. The main engine has two-axis thrust vectoring. The vehicle is fully computer controlled; with guidance from GPS and fiber optic gyroscopes.

===Wirefly X-Prize Cup 2007===
Armadillo Aerospace competed in the 2007 Lunar Lander Challenge event in the Wirefly X-Prize Cup 2007.

====Testing====
During testing one of the two Quad vehicles (named Texel) crashed on a tethered flight after a guidance problem caused the vehicle to rapidly gain altitude until 3 separate flight termination procedures were activated at approximately 20–30 feet. The vehicle fell, and the impact broke open one of the alcohol tanks and a large fireball engulfed the vehicle. The vehicle was irreparably damaged, and only its sister Pixel could compete in the upcoming event. The plan was to have the first module (of the next generation modular design) compete at level 1, and have Pixel compete at level 2 challenge.
====Competition====
In the level 1 events, Armadillo&#x27;s craft MOD (actually, module #1) logged several attempts, including several successful first leg flights but was unable to complete the return trip during any attempt.

On its first attempt, a clogged igniter orifice prevented ignition. On the second attempt, the first leg flight was perfect; increased guidance and control capabilities allowed the module to, in Carmack&#x27;s words, &#x27;burn the X-mark off the target pad&#x27;. The return leg was delayed slightly, because the igniter had clogged again. When the second leg was attempted, a &#x27;hard start&#x27; cracked the graphite combustion chamber. As the vehicle was still flying, Carmack flew the crippled vehicle through the course as quickly as possible and hovered 2–3 meters above the landing pad. With only a few seconds remaining in the required flight time, the damaged combustion chamber cracked again, which caused the vehicle to tilt enough to trigger a computer abort. The vehicle performed an auto-land, but the tilt caused the module to tip over on landing after only 82 seconds in the air.

The second attempt began with another perfect first leg, but the return was marred by another hard start. Seeing that the engine was badly damaged (although flying), the team commanded an abort. The module landed back on the pad after only a few seconds.

On the final attempt, MOD suffered a violent &quot;hard start&quot;, resulting in engine explosion. The violence of the explosion embedded a piece of the graphite chamber in the ground 64 meters from the launch pad and ended their attempts in 2007 for the prize.

===Lunar Lander Challenge 2008===

The 2008 Lunar Lander Challenge took place October 24–25 at the Las Cruces International Airport in New Mexico. Armadillo Aerospace competed for the third year but for the first time had competition, from the TrueZer0 team. Both received waivers from the FAA to fly experimental rockets.

TrueZero attempted level 1, achieved hover, then lost roll control and was aborted and crashed.

Armadillo had an unsuccessful first attempt at level 1 and landed early due to inadequate thrust. On their second attempt they completed the first leg, but the second leg was cut short by the FAA closing the flight window. The second leg was held in the afternoon, and they were able to take the Level 1 top prize of $350,000.

Armadillo&#x27;s attempt at the level 2 prize on October 25 was aborted due to their vehicle toppling over after the engine casing burned through due to a fuel-line problem.

===Lunar Lander Challenge 2009===

Armadillo attempted the Level 2 prize on September 12, 2009. Armadillo successfully flew both legs with their Mod vehicle, each flight lasting over 180 seconds, landing safely. However their landing accuracy was not sufficient to win the first prize, instead they won the second prize while Masten Space Systems&#x27; Xoie lander won the Level 2 first prize.

==Rocket Racing League==
In 2008, the Rocket Racing League announced that Armadillo Aerospace engines would be used in a second generation of X-Racer aircraft.
, the Rocket Racing League was utilizing a highly modified Velocity XL FG airframe and an Armadillo Aerospace 2,500 pound thrust liquid oxygen (LOX) and ethanol rocket engine in both the Mark-II X-Racer and Mark-III X-Racer demonstration vehicles.
The Rocket Racing league never got out of its early development mode, and no racing season was ever held.

==Vehicles==

===Super Mod===
The &quot;Super Mod&quot; reusable launch vehicle is a vertical-takeoff, vertical-landing (VTVL) uncrewed rocket which was developed by Armadillo in 2010–2011. It was submitted to NASA as a potential suborbital vehicle for use as a suborbital reusable launch vehicle (sRLV) under NASA&#x27;s Flight Opportunities Program. It added aerodynamic fairings, partially extendable landing legs with lower aerodynamic drag, and systems improvements to the basic Mod vehicle structure and systems.
===Stig===

In late 2010, Armadillo started development of a new, longer rocket design created for lower-drag, higher-speed high-altitude flights, which they named Stig in homage of the &quot;Top Gear&quot; driver The Stig. This rocket had similar systems, motors, and component weights as the Super Mod vehicles but was aerodynamically optimized for high-altitude flights with long diameter cylindrical tanks instead of larger spherical tanks.
The second flight, which took place in 2012, reached 50 miles (82 kilometers), but the recovery chute did not work as planned.

The third flight took place in January 2013, and the vehicle experienced a hard landing following a parachute failure-to-deploy, though the launch was successful.

==Staff and funding==
Armadillo was headed, and largely funded, by John Carmack, a developer of video games including the &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake series&quot;. During its early days, all of its employees (including Carmack) had other, full-time jobs and contributed their efforts twice weekly to Armadillo on a voluntary basis. Armadillo had a relatively small budget and was not supported by aerospace companies or agencies like NASA, ESA, or Boeing. Armadillo Aerospace publicly declared itself fully self-funded.

In February 2006, Carmack stated that the program to date had cost slightly over $2 million. Even by the standards of X-Prize candidates, this is a low budget. Scaled Composites is estimated to have spent $25 million on its SpaceShipOne development program.

On August 8, 2006, Armadillo Aerospace announced that it had reached a sponsorship deal with Nvidia. While details were sparse, John Carmack said, &quot;There is a chance at this point that I may have written the last personal cheque I need to for Armadillo.&quot;

In April 2008, Carmack offered an updated figure of &quot;total cost to date, about $3.5 million.&quot; He estimated that another $2 million would be needed to achieve a crewed flight to 100 km using Armadillo&#x27;s modular design in a &quot;six-pack&quot; configuration.

By 2010, Armadillo had 7 full-time employees and was profitable on ongoing operations (though Carmack was continuing to invest in development efforts).

The company mascot was an armadillo named Widget.

===2013 &quot;Hibernation mode&quot; and sale of assets===
In August 2013, Carmack indicated that following the crash of the STIG-B rocket earlier that year, he had wound down the company operations and had put the company in &quot;hibernation mode.&quot; Armadillo had stopped accepting (profitable) contract R&amp;D work two years prior in order to focus on development of a suborbital reusable rocket. During those two years, Armadillo operated at an approximately US$1 million per year burn rate funded personally by Carmack. Several reasons were offered for this outcome, including a failure to adopt a multi-test-vehicle build strategy, making the loss of a single rocket more significant than it would have otherwise been.

, Carmack was &quot;actively looking for outside investors to restart work on the company’s rockets.&quot;

In 2015, the assets of Armadillo Aerospace were sold to EXOS Aerospace Systems &amp; Technologies, Inc.

==Future research==
Carmack stated in his monthly reports and in forum posts that he expected his path to an orbital vehicle to include modular rockets similar to OTRAG technology. Lutz Kayser, the founding engineer of OTRAG, visited Armadillo in May 2006 and loaned Carmack some of their original research hardware.

&quot;I have been corresponding with Lutz for a few months now, and I have learned quite a few things. I seriously considered an OTRAG style massive-cluster-of-cheap-modules orbital design back when we had 98% peroxide (assumed to be a biprop with kerosene), and I have always considered it one of the viable routes to significant reduction in orbital launch costs. After really going over the trades and details with Lutz, I am quite convinced that this is the lowest development cost route to significant orbital capability. Eventually, reusable stages will take over, but I actually think that we can make it all the way to orbit on our current budget by following this path. The individual modules are less complicated than our current vehicles, and I am becoming more and more fond of high production methods over hand crafter prototypes.&quot; -- June 2006 Armadillo Aerospace Update

<text>Johann Jakob Reiske (Latin: &quot;Johannes Jacobus Reiskius&quot;; 25 December 1716 – 14 August 1774) was a German scholar and physician. He was a pioneer in the fields of Arabic and Byzantine philology as well as Islamic numismatics.

==Biography==
Reiske was born at Zörbig, in the Electorate of Saxony.

From the orphanage in Halle he passed in 1733 to the University of Leipzig, and there spent five years. He tried to find his own way in middle Greek literature, to which German schools then gave little attention; but, as he had not mastered the grammar, he soon found this a sore task and took up Arabic. He was poor, having almost nothing beyond his allowance, which for the five years was only two hundred thalers. But everything of which he could cheat his appetite was spent on Arabic books, and when he had read all that was then printed he thirsted for manuscripts, and in March 1738 started on foot for Hamburg, joyous though totally unprovided, on his way to Leiden and the treasures of the Warnerianum.

At Hamburg, he got some money and letters of recommendation from the Hebraist Johann Christoph Wolf, and took ship to Amsterdam. There d&#x27;Orville, to whom he had an introduction, proposed to retain him as his amanuensis at a salary of six hundred guilders. Reiske refused, though he thought the offer very generous; he did not want money, he wanted manuscripts. When he reached Leiden (6 June 1738), he found that the lectures were over for the term and that the manuscripts were not open to him.

But d&#x27;Orville and Albert Schultens helped him to private teaching and reading for the press, by which he was able to live. He heard the lectures of A. Schultens, and practised himself in Arabic with his son J.J. Schultens. Through Schultens too he got at Arabic manuscripts, and was even allowed &quot;sub rosa&quot; to take them home with him. Ultimately he seems to have got free access to the collection, which he catalogued—the work of almost a whole summer, for which the curators rewarded him with nine guilders.

Reiske&#x27;s first years in Leiden were not unhappy, until he got into serious trouble by introducing emendations of his own into the second edition of Burmann&#x27;s &quot;Petronius&quot;, which he had to see through the press. His patrons withdrew from him, and his chance of perhaps becoming professor was gone; d&#x27;Orville indeed soon came round, for he could not do without Reiske, who did work of which his patron, after dressing it up in his own style, took the credit. But A. Schultens was never the same as before to him; Reiske indeed was too independent, and hurt him by his open criticisms of his master&#x27;s way of making Arabic mainly a handmaid of Hebrew. Reiske himself, however, admitted that Schultens always behaved honourably to him. In 1742, by Schultens&#x27; advice Reiske took up medicine as a study by which he might hope to live if he could not do so by philology. In 1746, he graduated as M.D., the fees being remitted at Schultens&#x27; intercession. It was Schultens too who conquered the difficulties opposed to his graduation at the last moment by the faculty of theology on the ground that some of his theses had a materialistic ring.

On 10 June 1746 he left the Netherlands and settled in Leipzig, where he hoped to get medical practice. But his shy, proud nature was not fitted to gain patients, and the Leipzig doctors would not recommend one who was not a Leipzig graduate. In 1747, an Arabic dedication to the electoral prince of Saxony got him the title of professor, but neither the faculty of arts nor that of medicine was willing to admit him among them, and he never delivered a course of lectures. He had still to go on doing literary task-work, but his labour was much worse paid in Leipzig than in Leiden. Still he could have lived and sent his old mother, as his custom was, a yearly present of a piece of leather to be sold in retail if he had been a better manager. But, careless for the morrow, he was always printing at his own cost great books which found no buyers. In his autobiography &quot;Lebensbeschreibung&quot; he depicted his academical colleagues as hostile; and suspected Ernesti, under a show of friendship, secretly hindered his promotion. On the other hand, his unsparing reviews made bad blood with the pillars of the university.

In 1755 to 1756 he turned his attention to Oriental coins. The custodian at the Royal Coin Cabinet in Dresden, Richter, invited him to study the coins with Arabic inscriptions. Richter asked him to explain the texts on the coins. His resulting &quot;letters on Arabic coinage (Briefe über das arabische Münzwesen)&quot; were posthumously published by Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. He did it very eagerly with the hope to find a suitable bread job in Dresden. However, the Seven Years&#x27; War ended all hopes to find anything in Oriental studies. His &quot;letters on Arabic coinage&quot; were the first serious attempt to compare the historical information gathered from the Islamic coins - bearing up to 150 words – with the information from chronicles, to achieve new insights in medieval Islamic history. Among the Orientalists at his time he was now known as someone knowledgeable on Islamic coins. He was later approached by Carsten Niebuhr to identify the coins which he brought with him from his travels. But Reiske never came back seriously to this topic.

At length in 1758 the magistrates of Leipzig rescued him from his misery by giving him the rectorate of St. Nicolai, and, though he still made no way with the leading men of the university and suffered from the hostility of men like Ruhnken and J.D. Michaelis, he was compensated for this by the esteem of Frederick the Great, of Lessing, Niebuhr, and many foreign scholars.

The last decade of his life was made cheerful by his marriage with Ernestine Müller, who shared all his interests and learned Greek to help him with collations. In proof of his gratitude, her portrait stands beside his in the first volume of the &quot;Oratores Graeci&quot;. Reiske died in Leipzig on 14 August 1774, and his manuscript remains passed, through Lessing&#x27;s mediation, to the Danish historian P.F. Suhm, and are now in the Royal Library, Copenhagen.

==Achievements==

Reiske excelled as a scholar of Arabic literature. Interested in the history and the realia of the literature, he cared less for the verse of the poets than for the historical notices to be found in their scholia - the much praised poetry of Hariri seemed to him a grammatical pedant. The scholia on Jarir provided information on the prevalence of Buddhist doctrine and asceticism in Iraq under the Omayyads. In the &quot;Adnotationes historicae&quot; to his &quot;Abulfeda&quot; (&quot;Abulf. Annales Moslemici&quot;, 5 volumes, Copenhagen, 1789–91), he collected a veritable treasure of sound and original research; he knew the Byzantine writers as thoroughly as the Arabic authors, and was alike at home in modern works of travel in all languages and in ancient and medieval authorities. He was interested too in numismatics.

To comprehensive knowledge and very wide reading he added a sound historical judgment. He was not, like Schultens, deceived by the pretended antiquity of the Yemenite &quot;Qasidas&quot;. Errors no doubt he made, as in the attempt to ascertain the date of the breach of the dam of Ma&#x27;rib.

Although &quot;Abulfeda&quot; as a late epitomator afforded no starting point for methodical study of the sources, Reiske&#x27;s edition with his version and notes laid the foundation for research into Arab history, and a historical criticism of Oriental numismatics with his letters on Arabic coinage (in J. G. Eichhorn&#x27;s &quot;Repertorium&quot;, vols. ix.-xi.). The foundation of Arabic philology, however, was laid not by him but by Silvestre de Sacy. Reiske&#x27;s linguistic knowledge was great, but he used it only to understand his authors; he had no feeling for form, for language as language, or for metre.

In Leipzig Reiske worked mainly at Greek, while he continued to draw on his Arabic stores accumulated in Leiden. His merit as an Arabist was sooner recognized than the value of his Greek work. Reiske the Greek scholar has been rightly valued only in recent years, and it is now recognized that he was the first German since Sylburg who had a living knowledge of the Greek tongue. His reputation does not rest on his numerous editions, often hasty or even made to booksellers&#x27; orders, but in his remarks, especially his conjectures. He himself designates the &quot;Animadversiones in scriptores Graecos&quot; as &quot;flos ingenii sui&quot;, and in truth these thin booklets outweigh his big editions.

Closely following the author&#x27;s thought he removes obstacles whenever he meets them, but he is so steeped in the language and thinks so truly like a Greek that the difficulties he feels often seem to us to lie in mere points of style. His criticism is empirical and unmethodical, based on immense and careful reading, and applied only when he feels a difficulty; and he is most successful when he has a large mass of tolerably homogeneous literature to lean on, while on isolated points he is often at a loss. His corrections are often hasty and false, but a surprisingly large proportion of them have since received confirmation from manuscripts, and, though his merits as a Grecian lie mainly in his conjectures, his realism is felt in this sphere also; his German translations especially show more freedom and practical insight, more feeling for actual life, than is common with the scholars of that age.

<doc id="177633" wikidata="Q1641477" url="?curid=177633" title="Hypothetical syllogism">
<text>In classical logic, a hypothetical syllogism is a valid argument form, a deductive syllogism with a conditional statement for one or both of its premises. Ancient references point to the works of Theophrastus and Eudemus for the first investigation of this kind of syllogisms.

== Types ==
Hypothetical syllogisms come in two types: mixed and pure. A &quot;mixed&quot; hypothetical syllogism has two premises: one conditional statement and one statement that either affirms or denies the antecedent or consequent of that conditional statement. For example,

:If P, then Q.
:P.
:∴ Q.

In this example, the first premise is a conditional statement in which &quot;P&quot; is the antecedent and &quot;Q&quot; is the consequent. The second premise &quot;affirms&quot; the antecedent. The conclusion, that the consequent must be true, is deductively valid.

A mixed hypothetical syllogism has four possible forms, two of which are valid, while the other two are invalid. A valid mixed hypothetical syllogism either affirms the antecedent (modus ponens) or denies the consequent (modus tollens). An invalid hypothetical syllogism either affirms the consequent (fallacy of the converse) or denies the antecedent (fallacy of the inverse).

A &quot;pure&quot; hypothetical syllogism is a syllogism in which both premises and the conclusion are all conditional statements. The antecedent of one premise must match the consequent of the other for the conditional to be valid. Consequently, conditionals contain remained antecedent as antecedent and remained consequent as consequent.
:If P, then Q.
:If Q, then R.
:∴ If P, then R.
An example in English:

:If I do not wake up, then I cannot go to work.
:If I cannot go to work, then I will not get paid.
:Therefore, if I do not wake up, then I will not get paid.
==Propositional logic==
In propositional logic, hypothetical syllogism is the name of a valid rule of inference (often abbreviated HS and sometimes also called the chain argument, chain rule, or the principle of transitivity of implication). The rule may be stated:

:formula_1

In other words, whenever instances of &quot;formula_2&quot;, and &quot;formula_3&quot; appear on lines of a proof, &quot;formula_4&quot; can be placed on a subsequent line.

== Applicability ==
The rule of hypothetical syllogism holds in classical logic, intuitionistic logic, most systems of relevance logic, and many other systems of logic. However, it does not hold in all logics, including, for example, non-monotonic logic, probabilistic logic and default logic. The reason for this is that these logics describe defeasible reasoning, and conditionals that appear in real-world contexts typically allow for exceptions, default assumptions, ceteris paribus conditions, or just simple uncertainty.

An example, derived from Ernest W. Adams, 
# If Jones wins the election, Smith will retire after the election.
# If Smith dies before the election, Jones will win the election. 
# If Smith dies before the election, Smith will retire after the election.

Clearly, (3) does not follow from (1) and (2). (1) is true by default, but fails to hold in the exceptional circumstances of Smith dying. In practice, real-world conditionals always tend to involve default assumptions or contexts, and it may be infeasible or even impossible to specify all the exceptional circumstances in which they might fail to be true. For similar reasons, the rule of hypothetical syllogism does not hold for counterfactual conditionals.

== Formal notation ==
The &quot;hypothetical syllogism&quot; inference rule may be written in sequent notation, which amounts to a specialization of the cut rule:

: formula_5

where formula_6 is a metalogical symbol and formula_7 meaning that formula_8 is a syntactic consequence of formula_9 in some logical system;

and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:

:formula_10

where formula_11, formula_12, and formula_13 are propositions expressed in some formal system.

==Proof ==
==Alternative forms==
An alternative form of hypothetical syllogism, more useful for classical propositional calculus systems with implication and negation (i.e. without the conjunction symbol), is the following:

:(HS1) formula_14

Yet another form is: 

:(HS2) formula_15

===Proof===
An example of the proofs of these theorems in such systems is given below. We use two of the three axioms used in one of the popular systems described by Jan Łukasiewicz.
The proofs relies on two out of the three axioms of this system:
:(A1) formula_16
:(A2) formula_17

The proof of the (HS1) is as follows:
:(1) formula_18       (instance of (A1))
:(2) formula_19       (instance of (A2))
:(3) formula_20       (from (1) and (2) by modus ponens)
:(4) formula_21       (instance of (A2))
:(5) formula_22       (from (3) and (4) by modus ponens)
:(6) formula_23       (instance of (A1))
:(7) formula_24 (from (5) and (6) by modus ponens)

The proof of the (HS2) is given here.

===As a metatheorem===
Whenever we have two theorems of the form formula_25 and formula_26, we can prove formula_27 by the following steps:
:(1) formula_28       (instance of the theorem proved above)
:(2) formula_29       (instance of (T1))
:(3) formula_30       (from (1) and (2) by modus ponens)
:(4) formula_31       (instance of (T2))
:(5) formula_32       (from (3) and (4) by modus ponens)

<doc id="177636" wikidata="Q5503916" url="?curid=177636" title="Friedrich Sylburg">
<text>Friedrich Sylburg (1536 – 17 February 1596) was a German classical scholar.

The son of a farmer, he was born at Wetter near Marburg. He studied at Marburg, Jena, Geneva, and, lastly, Paris, where his teacher was Henry Estienne (Stephanus), to whose great &quot;Greek Thesaurus&quot; Sylburg afterwards made important contributions.

Returning to Germany, he held educational posts at Neuhausen near Worms and at Lich near Gießen, where he edited a useful edition of the &quot;Institutiones in graecam linguam&quot; (1580) of Nicolaus Clenardus (Cleynaerts). In 1583 he resigned his post at Lich and moved to Frankfurt to act as corrector and editor of Greek texts for the enterprising publisher Johann Wechel. To his Frankfurt period belong the editions of Pausanias, Herodotus, Dionysius Halicarnassensis (one of his best pieces of work, highly praised by Carsten Niebuhr), Paeanius, Aristotle, the Greek and Latin sources for the history of the Roman emperors and the &quot;Peri syntaxeos&quot; of Apollonius Dyscolus.

In 1591 he moved to Heidelberg, where he became librarian to the elector palatine. The Wechel series was continued by Hieronymus Commelinus (Jerome Commelin) of Heidelberg, for whom Sylburg edited Clement of Alexandria, Justin Martyr, the &quot;Etymologicum magnum&quot;, the &quot;Scriptores de re rustica&quot;, the Greek gnomic poets, Xenophon, Nonnus and other works. All Sylburg&#x27;s editions show great critical power and indefatigable industry; the latter may well have caused his death.

<text>Carsten Niebuhr, or Karsten Niebuhr (17 March 1733 Lüdingworth – 26 April 1815 Meldorf, Dithmarschen), was a German mathematician, cartographer, and explorer in the service of Denmark-Norway. He is renowned for his participation in the Danish Arabia expedition (1761-1767). He was the father of the Danish-German statesman and historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr, who published an account of his father&#x27;s life in 1817.

==Early life and education==
Niebuhr was born in Lüdingworth (now a part of Cuxhaven, Lower Saxony) in what was then Bremen-Verden. His father Barthold Niebuhr (1704-1749) was a successful farmer and owned his own property. Carsten and his sister were educated at home by a local school teacher, then he attended the Latin School in Otterndorf, near Cuxhaven.

Originally Niebuhr had intended to become a surveyor, but in 1757 he went to the &quot;Georgia Augusta&quot; University of Göttingen, at this time Germany&#x27;s most progressive institution of higher education. Niebuhr was probably a bright student because in 1760 Johann David Michaelis (1717-1791) recommended him as a participant in the Danish Arabia expedition (1761-1767), mounted by Frederick V of Denmark (1722–1766). For a year and a half before the expedition Niebuhr studied mathematics, cartography and navigational astronomy under Tobias Mayer (1723–1762), one of the premier astronomers of the 18th century, and the author of the Lunar Distance Method for determining longitude. Niebuhr&#x27;s observations during the Arabia Expedition proved the accuracy and the practicality of this method for use by mariners at sea.

==Expeditions==
The expedition sailed in January 1761 via Marseilles and Malta to Istanbul and Alexandria. Then the members of the expedition visited Cairo and Sinai, before traversing the Red Sea via Jiddah to Yemen, which was their main destination.

In Mocha, on 25 May 1763, the expedition&#x27;s philologist, Frederik Christian von Haven, died, and on 11 July 1763, on the way to Sanaʽa, the capital of Yemen, its naturalist Peter Forsskål also died.

In Sanaʽa the remaining members of the expedition had an audience with the Imam of Yemen al-Mahdi Abbas (1719–1775), but suffered from the climate and returned to Mocha. Niebuhr seems to have preserved his own life and restored his health by adopting native dress and eating native food.

From Mocha the expedition continued to Bombay, the expedition&#x27;s artist Georg Wilhelm Baurenfeind died on the 29th of August and the expedition&#x27;s servant Lars Berggren on the following day; both were buried at sea. The surgeon Christian C. Kramer (1732–1763) also died, soon after landing in Bombay. Niebuhr was the only surviving member. He stayed in Bombay for fourteen months and then returned home by way of Muscat, Bushire, Shiraz, and Persepolis. His copies of the cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis proved to be a key turning-point in the decipherment of cuneiform, and the birth of Assyriology.

His transcriptions were especially useful to Georg Friedrich Grotefend, who made the first correct decipherments of Old Persian cuneiform:

He also visited the ruins of Babylon (making many important sketches), Baghdad, Mosul, and Aleppo. He seems also to have visited the Behistun Inscription in around 1764. After a visit to Cyprus, he made a tour through Palestine, crossed the Taurus Mountains to Bursa, reached Constantinople in February 1767 and finally arrived in Copenhagen in the following November.

Niebuhr&#x27;s production during the expedition is indeed impressive. It includes small-scale maps and charts of Yemen, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and Oman, and other larger scale maps covering the Nile Delta, the Gulf of Suez and the regions surrounding various port cities he visited, including Mocha and Surat. He completed 28 town plans of significant historical value because of their uniqueness for that period.

In summary, Niebuhr&#x27;s maps, charts and plans constitute the greatest single addition to the cartography of the region that was produced through field research and published in the 18th century.

==Family and later career==
In 1773, Niebuhr married Christiane Sophia Blumenberg, the daughter of the crown physician, and for some years he held a post in the Danish military service, which enabled him to remain in Copenhagen. In 1776 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1778 he accepted a position in the civil service of Danish Holstein, and went to reside at Meldorf (Ditmarschen). In 1806 he was promoted to &quot;Etatsrat&quot;, and in 1809 was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, one of Denmark–Norway&#x27;s most valued honours for service.

==Writing and research==
Niebuhr&#x27;s first book, &quot;Beschreibung von Arabien&quot;, was published in Copenhagen in 1772, the Danish government providing subsidies for the engraving and printing of its numerous illustrations. This was followed in 1774 and 1778 by the first two volumes of Niebuhr&#x27;s &quot;Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien und andern umliegender Ländern&quot;. These works (particularly the one published in 1778), and most specifically the accurate copies of the cuneiform inscriptions found at Persepolis, were to prove to be extremely important to the decipherment of cuneiform writing. Before Niebuhr&#x27;s publication, cuneiform inscriptions were often thought to be merely decorations and embellishments, and no accurate decipherments or translations had been made up to that point. Niebuhr demonstrated that the three trilingual inscriptions found at Persepolis were in fact three distinct forms of cuneiform writing (which he termed Class I, Class II, and Class III) to be read from left to right. His accurate copies of the trilingual inscriptions gave Orientalists the key to finally crack the cuneiform code, leading to the discovery of Old Persian, Akkadian, and Sumerian.

The third volume of the &quot;Reisebeschreibung&quot;, also based on materials from the expedition, was not published till 1837, long after Niebuhr&#x27;s death, under the editorship of his daughter and his assistant, Johan Nicolaus Gloyer. Niebuhr also contributed papers on the interior of Africa, the political and military condition of the Ottoman Empire, and other subjects to a German periodical, the &quot;Deutsches Museum&quot;. In addition, he edited and published the work of his friend Peter Forsskål, the naturalist on the Arabian expedition, under the titles &quot;Descriptiones animalium, Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica&quot; and &quot;Icones rerum naturalium&quot; (Copenhagen, 1775 and 1776).

French and Dutch translations of Niebuhr&#x27;s narratives were published during his lifetime, and a condensed English translation of his own three volumes, prepared by Robert Heron, was published in Edinburgh in 1792, under the title &quot;Travels through Arabia&quot;. A facsimile edition of this translation, as by &quot;M. Niebuhr&quot;, was published in two volumes by the Libraire du Liban, Beirut (undated).

The government funds covered only a fraction of the printing costs for Niebuhr&#x27;s first book, and probably a similar or smaller proportion of the costs for the other two volumes. To ensure that the volumes were published, Niebuhr had to pay over 80% of the costs himself. In all, Niebuhr devoted ten years of his life, the years 1768–1778, to the publication of six volumes of findings from the expedition. He had virtually no help from the academics who had conceived and shaped the expedition in Göttingen and Copenhagen. It was only Niebuhr&#x27;s determination to publish the findings of the expedition that ensured that the Danish Arabia expedition would produce results that would benefit the world of scholarship.

==Death and legacy==
Niebuhr died in Meldorf in 1815.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) highly prized Niebuhr&#x27;s works. In 1811 he wrote to Niebuhr&#x27;s son, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, that &quot;You carry a name which I have learned to honour since my youth.&quot;

Carsten Niebuhrs Gade, a street in the port area of Copenhagen, is named after him.

In 2011, Copenhagen&#x27;s National Library and National Museum held exhibitions of Carsten Niebuhr&#x27;s life and work, celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Danish Arabia Expedition&#x27;s commencement. Commemorative Carsten Niebuhr postal stamps were issued. And in the same year the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had planned a series of cultural events based on the Expedition and Niebuhr&#x27;s work that would take place in Ankara, Cairo, Damascus, Beirut, Tehran, and Yemen. It has been suggested that these efforts were intended in part to repair the reputational damage in the Islamic world caused by the Danish cartoon controversy. Ultimately, the planned events were prevented by the Arab Spring.

<text>The European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA) was a theater of Operations responsible for directing United States Army operations throughout the European theatre of World War II, from 1942 to 1945. It commanded Army Ground Forces (AGF), United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), and Army Service Forces (ASF) operations north of Italy and the Mediterranean coast. It was bordered to the south by the North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), which later became the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, United States Army (MTOUSA).

The term &quot;theater of operations&quot; was defined in the US Army field manuals as &quot;the land and sea areas to be invaded or defended, including areas necessary for administrative activities incident to the military operations&quot;. In accordance with the experience of World War I, it was usually conceived of as a large land mass over which continuous operations would take place and was divided into two chief areas-the combat zone, or the area of active fighting, and the Communications Zone, or area required for administration of the theater. As the armies advanced, both these zones and the areas into which they were divided would shift forward to new geographic areas of control.

==History==
British–American military staffs agreed during their meetings in Washington in January–March 1941 (the ABC-1 Conversations) to exchange military missions to facilitate planning for the eventuality of American entry in the war. Major General James E. Chaney, an Army Air Corps officer, arrived in the United Kingdom on 18 May 1941, and on the following day, Headquarters, Special Observer Group (SPOBS), was established in London. SPOBS also had the role of studying British use of Lend Lease supplies. His formal title was the Special Army Observer in the United Kingdom and head of SPOBS. After the United States entered the war, SPOBS was succeeded by United States Army Forces in the British Isles (USAFBI), actually SPOBS under a new name. At the time of the ARCADIA Conference, December 1941 – January 1942, the decision was made to place the MAGNET forces (U.S. Forces for Northern Ireland) under the command of Maj. Gen. E.L. Daley, and make him in turn responsible to General Chaney, designated as CG, USAFBI. On 5 May 1942, Maj. Gen. John C. H. Lee became Commanding General, Services of Supply, U.S. Army Forces British Isles, and later deputy theater commander, ETOUSA. On 8 June 1942, the United States Department of War officially established ETOUSA in its place. Its mission was to conduct planning for the eventual retaking of Europe and to exercise administrative and operational control over U.S. forces.

The 133rd Infantry Regiment of the 34th Infantry Division was the first United States Army unit sent to Europe in World War II. The first battalion arrived in Belfast in late January 1942, followed by the rest of the regiment in February. These units were designated as U.S. Army Northern Ireland Forces, later incorporated within the European Theater of Operations. The 133rd and 168th Infantry Regiments trained in the peat bogs, and performed border guard patrols between British Northern Ireland and neutral Ireland. The remaining unit of the division, the 135th Infantry Regiment, arrived in May 1942.
From February 1944 the operational command was the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) which as an Allied command also had operational control of British and all other allied land forces and tactical airforces in the European theatre. Until SHAEF was operational ETOUSA liaised closely with the British in the planning and organising of Operation Overlord.

U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower had multiple command appointments; he replaced Chaney in late June 1942, but in November he also commanded the Allied forces in Operation Torch through AFHQ. Operation Torch—the invasion of French North Africa—involving the 9th, 3rd Infantry and the 2nd Armored Divisions, initiated on 8 November 1942, was the first ground combat operations for the United States in the European theater of World War II.

Eisenhower then relinquished command of ETOUSA to Lt. Gen. Frank Maxwell Andrews in February 1943, who was killed in an air crash in May. He was replaced by Lt. Gen. Jacob L. Devers, former Chief of the Armored Force. In December 1943 it was announced that Eisenhower would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. In January 1944 he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. (Note that Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Forces (SHAEF) was the headquarters of the Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, whereas the AFHQ was the headquarters of only the Allied forces.) He served in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945. From February 1944, SHAEF was the operational command and ETOUSA administrative command.

Some units were transferred between operational commands and administrative commands at different times. For example, the American 6th Army Group, which was set up under the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, commanded by Devers, to oversee Operation Dragoon, the invasion of Southern France between Toulon and Cannes, was passed to SHAEF (and into ETO) a month after the invasion which took place on 15 August 1944.

By the end of 1944, Eisenhower, through SHAEF, commanded three powerful Allied army groups. In the north British 21st Army Group commanded by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (&quot;Monty&quot;), in the middle the American 12th Army Group commanded by General Omar N. Bradley, and in the South the American 6th Army Group commanded by Devers. The British 21st Army Group and French elements of the 6th Army Group were not part of ETOUSA, but by that stage of the war most of the operational forces under the command of SHAEF were American.

The ETOUSA planning staff in London was usually referred to by its Army Post Office number, &quot;APO 887&quot;. After the war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945, ETOUSA became briefly U.S. Armed Forces Europe, then U.S. Forces, European Theater (USFET), and then, eventually, United States Army Europe.

Albert Coady Wedemeyer was chief author of the Victory Program, published three months before the U.S. entered the war in 1941, which advocated the defeat of the German armies on the European continent. When the U.S. entered the war after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the U.S. was at war with both Japan and Germany, a &quot;Europe first&quot; a modified version of his plan was adopted by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Under the German first policy, the plan was expanded to include the blueprint for the Normandy landings.

==Successor organizations==
ETOUSA became United States Forces European Theater (USFET) from 1 July 1945 to 15 March 1947; and then European Command (EUCOM) 15 March 1947 to 1 August 1952.

Official U.S. Army lineage details for the European Theater of Operations are:
*Organized 8 January 1942 in England as Headquarters, United States Army Forces in the British Isles
*Redesignated 8 June 1942 as Headquarters, European Theater of Operations, United States Army
*Redesignated 1 July 1945 as Headquarters, United States Forces, European Theater
*Redesignated 15 March 1947 as Headquarters, European Command
*Redesignated 1 August 1952 as Headquarters, United States Army Europe

Also, on August 1, 1952, the United States European Command (USEUCOM) was established with General Matthew Ridgway in command. Ridgway served concurrently as the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). USEUCOM absorbed all functions and elements of EUCOM and additionally assumed control of all US Air Force and US Navy forces in Europe.

<text>A federal district is a specific administrative division in one of various federations. These districts may be under the direct jurisdiction of a federation&#x27;s national government, as in the case of federal territory (e.g., India, Malaysia), or they may function as ordinary federated units (e.g., Brazil, Russia). Federal districts often include capital districts.

== Countries ==
=== Current ===
==== Brazil ====
The Federal District () contains the Brazilian capital Brasília.

==== India ====
In India, the term &quot;Union Territory&quot; is used for the eight territories governed directly by the Union government (also called central government), administered by a Lieutenant Governor or an Administrator: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Lakshadweep and Puducherry.

In Pakistan, the term Federal Territory is used for the five zones and 12 union councils of Islamabad governed directly by the state government as Islamabad Capital Territory.

==== Russia ====
Russia has three cities of federal importance, established by the Constitution — Moscow and Saint Petersburg; it also claims Sevastopol as such (which is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, occupied by Russia). Each city is treated as a separate federal subject and has its own legislative body. Russia has federal districts, but these form an additional administrative layer between the federation government and the federal subjects rather than being a distinct type of jurisdiction.

==== United States ====
The seat of the U.S. federal government in Washington is located in a federal district called the District of Columbia. Other federally administered areas that are within one of the 50 states, but not under its jurisdiction, are called federal enclaves.

Additionally, the U.S. federal court system divides each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico into one or more federal judicial districts. A United States district court and a bankruptcy court are located in each. There are also regional federal judicial circuits, each consisting of a group of states (except for the District of Columbia Circuit, which consists of the federal district, and the Federal Circuit, whose jurisdiction is based on specific subject matter instead of geography); Puerto Rico and the United States territorial courts are also assigned to circuits. Each circuit has a United States court of appeals.

==== Venezuela ====
Capital District (Venezuela), where the Venezuelan capital Caracas is located.

==== Argentina ====
Federal District (Argentina) was converted into the &quot;Autonomous City of Buenos Aires&quot; in 1994.

==== Australia ====
The Jervis Bay Territory is an internal territory of the Commonwealth of Australia, surrendered by the state of New South Wales in 1915 to the Commonwealth Government so that the landlocked Australian Capital Territory would have maritime access. Due to the terms of the Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act, the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory, and it was administered by the Department of the Interior (and later by the Department of the Capital Territory) as if it were part of the Australian Capital Territory, although it has always been a separate Commonwealth territory. In 1989, when the ACT achieved self-government, the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories took over responsibility for the JBT&#x27;s administration, and it has since been administered by various Commonwealth departments responsible to the Minister for Territories.

==== Mexico ====
Former Federal District (Mexico), was converted into &quot;Mexico City&quot; in January 2016.
