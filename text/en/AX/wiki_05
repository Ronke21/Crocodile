<text>Leon F. Czolgosz ( ; ; May 5, 1873 – October 29, 1901) was an American laborer and anarchist who assassinated United States President William McKinley on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York. The president died on September 14 after his wound became infected. Caught in the act, Czolgosz was tried, convicted, and executed by the State of New York seven weeks later on October 29, 1901.

== Early life ==
Leon F. Czolgosz was born in Detroit, Michigan, on May 5, 1873. According to his father Paul Czolgosz, the &quot;F&quot; did not stand for anything, but it was there because he &quot;liked the extra initial&quot;. Leon was one of eight children born to the Polish-American family of Paul (Paweł) Czolgosz (1843–1944) and his wife Mary (Maria) Nowak. The family moved to Alpena, Michigan, in 1880. When Leon was 10 and the family was living in Posen, Michigan, Czolgosz&#x27;s mother died six weeks after giving birth to his sister, Victoria. In 1889, the Czolgosz family moved to Natrona, Pennsylvania, where Czolgosz worked at a glass factory. At age 17, they moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where he found employment at the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company. 

After the economic crash of 1893, when the mill closed for some time and tried to reduce wages, the workers went on strike. With great economic and social turmoil around him, Czolgosz found little comfort in the Catholic Church and other immigrant institutions; he sought others who shared his concerns regarding injustice. Czolgosz joined a moderate working man&#x27;s socialist club, the Knights of the Golden Eagle, and eventually a more radical socialist group known as the Sila Club, where he became interested in anarchism.

== Interest in anarchism ==
In 1898, after witnessing a series of similar strikes, many ending in violence, and perhaps ill from a respiratory disease, Czolgosz went to live with his father, who had bought a farm the year before in Warrensville, Ohio. 

Czolgosz became a recluse. He was impressed after hearing a speech by the anarchist Emma Goldman, whom Czolgosz met for the first time at one of her lectures in Cleveland in May 1901. After the lecture, Czolgosz approached the speakers&#x27; platform and asked her for reading recommendations. On the afternoon of July 12, 1901, he visited her at the home of Abraham Isaak, publisher of the newspaper &quot;Free Society&quot;, in Chicago and introduced himself as Fred C. &quot;Nieman&quot; (nobody), but Goldman was on her way to the train station. Czolgosz told her that he was disappointed in Cleveland&#x27;s socialists, and Goldman quickly introduced him to anarchist friends who were at the train station.

Goldman later wrote a piece in defense of Czolgosz, which portrays him and his history in a way at odds with other sources: &quot;Who can tell how many times this American child has gloried in the celebration of the 4th of July, or on Decoration Day, when he faithfully honored the nation&#x27;s dead? Who knows but what he, too, was willing to &#x27;fight for his country and die for her liberty&#x27;&quot;.

In the weeks that followed, Czolgosz&#x27;s social awkwardness, evasiveness, and blunt inquiries about secret societies around Isaak and another anarchist, Emil Schilling, resulted in the radical &quot;Free Society&quot; newspaper to issue a warning pertaining to him on September 1, reading:

Czolgosz believed there was a great injustice in American society, an inequality which allowed the wealthy to enrich themselves by exploiting the poor. He concluded that the reason for this was the structure of government. Around this time, Czolgosz learned of the assassination of a leader in Europe, King Umberto I of Italy, who had been shot dead by anarchist Gaetano Bresci on July 29, 1900. Bresci told the press that he had decided to take matters into his own hands for the sake of the common man.

== Assassination of President William McKinley ==
On August 31, 1901, Czolgosz traveled to Buffalo, New York, the site of the Pan-American Exposition, where President McKinley would be speaking. He rented a room in Nowak&#x27;s Hotel at 1078 Broadway.

On September 6, Czolgosz went to the exposition armed with a concealed .32-caliber Iver Johnson &quot;Safety Automatic&quot; revolver he had purchased four days earlier. Czolgosz approached McKinley, who had been standing in a receiving line inside the Temple of Music, greeting the public for 10 minutes. At 4:07 p.m., Czolgosz reached the front of the line. While McKinley extended his hand, Czolgosz slapped it aside and shot the President twice in the abdomen at point-blank range: the first bullet ricocheted off a coat button and lodged in McKinley&#x27;s jacket while the other bullet seriously wounded him in the stomach. McKinley&#x27;s stomach wound was not lethal, but he died eight days later on September 14 of an infection that had spread from the wound.

James Parker, a man standing directly behind Czolgosz, struck the assassin in the neck and knocked the gun out of his hand; as McKinley slumped backward, members of the crowd began beating Czolgosz. &quot;Go easy on him, boys&quot;, McKinley told the attackers. The police struggled to keep the angry crowd off Czolgosz. He was taken to Buffalo&#x27;s 13th Precinct house at 346 Austin Street and held in a cell until being moved to police headquarters.


== Trial and execution ==
After McKinley&#x27;s death, newly inaugurated President Theodore Roosevelt declared, &quot;When compared with the suppression of anarchy, every other question sinks into insignificance.&quot;

On September 13, the day before McKinley succumbed to his wounds, Czolgosz was taken from the police headquarters, which were undergoing repairs, and transferred to the Erie County Women&#x27;s Penitentiary temporarily. Three days later, he was brought to the Erie County Jail to be arraigned before County Judge Emery. After the arraignment, Czolgosz was transferred to Auburn Prison.

A grand jury indicted Czolgosz on September 16 with one count of first-degree murder. During his incarceration, Czolgosz spoke freely with his guards, but he refused every interaction with Robert C. Titus and Loran L. Lewis, the prominent judges-turned-attorneys assigned to defend him, and with the expert psychiatrist sent to test his sanity.

The case was prosecuted by the Erie County District Attorney, Thomas Penney, and assistant D.A. Frederick Haller. Although Czolgosz answered that he was pleading &quot;Guilty&quot;, presiding Judge Truman C. White overruled him and entered a &quot;Not Guilty&quot; plea on his behalf.

Czolgosz&#x27;s trial began in the state courthouse in Buffalo on September 23, 1901, nine days after McKinley died. Prosecution testimony took two days and consisted principally of the doctors who treated McKinley and various eyewitnesses to the shooting. Lewis and his co-counsel called no witnesses, which Lewis in his closing argument attributed to Czolgosz&#x27;s refusal to cooperate with them. In his 27-minute address to the jury, Lewis took pains to praise McKinley.

Scott Miller, author of &quot;The President and the Assassin&quot;, notes that the closing argument was more calculated to defend the attorney&#x27;s &quot;place in the community, rather than an effort to spare his client the electric chair&quot;.

Even had the jury believed the defense that Czolgosz was insane, by claiming that no sane man would have shot and killed the president in such a public and blatant manner, knowing he would be caught, there was still the legal definition of insanity to overcome. Under New York law, Czolgosz was legally insane only if he was unable to understand what he was doing. The jury was unconvinced of Czolgosz&#x27;s insanity due to the directions given to them by Judge White; they voted to convict him after less than a half-hour of deliberations (a jury member later said it would have been sooner but they wanted to review the evidence before conviction). 

Czolgosz had two visits the night before his execution, one with two clergymen and another later in the night with his brother and brother-in-law. Even though Czolgosz refused Father Fudzinski and Father Hickey twice, Superintendent Collins permitted their visit and escorted them to his cell. The priests pleaded for 45 minutes for Czolgosz to repent, but he refused, so they left. Czolgosz&#x27;s brother Waldeck and brother-in-law Frank Bandowski visited after the priests had left. Waldeck asked Czolgosz, &quot;Who got you into this scrape?&quot;, to which Czolgosz responded, &quot;No one. Nobody had anything to do with it but me.&quot; His brother said it was unlike Czolgosz and was not how he was raised. When asked by his brother if he wanted the priests to come back, Czolgosz said, &quot;No, damn them. Don&#x27;t send them here again. I don&#x27;t want them,&quot; and, &quot;Don&#x27;t you have any praying over me when I am dead. I don&#x27;t want it. I don&#x27;t want any of their damned religion.&quot; Czolgosz&#x27;s father wrote a letter to his son the night before his execution, wishing Czolgosz luck and informing him that he could no longer help him, and Leon had to &quot;pay the price for his actions.&quot; Although after the trial, Czolgosz and his attorneys were informed of his right to appeal the sentence, they chose not to after Czolgosz declined. The attorneys also knew that there were no grounds for appeal; the trial had been &quot;quick, swift, and fair.&quot;

Czolgosz&#x27;s last words were: &quot;I killed the President because he was the enemy of the good people – the good working people. I am not sorry for my crime. I am sorry I could not see my father.&quot; Czolgosz was electrocuted by three jolts, each of 1,800 volts, in Auburn Prison on October 29, 1901, 45 days after McKinley&#x27;s death. Czolgosz was pronounced dead at 7:14 a.m. The state electrician (executioner) of Czolgosz was Edwin Davis.

Waldeck Czolgosz and Frank Bandowski attended the execution. When Waldeck asked the warden for his brother&#x27;s body, to be taken for proper burial, he was informed that he &quot;would never be able to take it away&quot;, and that crowds of people would mob him. 

Czolgosz was autopsied by John E. Gerin; his brain was autopsied by Edward Anthony Spitzka. The autopsy showed his teeth were normal but in poor condition; likewise, the external genitals were normal, although scars were present, the result of chancroids. The autopsy showed the deceased was in good health; a death mask was made of his face. The body was buried on prison grounds. Prison authorities had planned to inter the body with quicklime to hasten its decomposition, but decided otherwise after testing quicklime on a sample of meat. After determining that they were not legally limited to the use of quicklime for the process, they poured sulfuric acid into Czolgosz&#x27;s coffin so that his body would be completely disfigured. The warden estimated that the acid caused the body to disintegrate within 12 hours. His clothes and possessions were burned in the prison incinerator to discourage exhibitions of his life.

== Legacy ==
Emma Goldman was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the assassination, but was released due to insufficient evidence. She later incurred a great deal of negative publicity when Goldman published &quot;The Tragedy at Buffalo&quot;. In the article, she compared Czolgosz to Marcus Junius Brutus, the assassin of Julius Caesar, and called McKinley the &quot;president of the money kings and trust magnates.&quot; Other anarchists and radicals were unwilling to support Goldman&#x27;s effort to aid Czolgosz, believing that he had harmed the movement.

The scene of the crime, the Temple of Music, was demolished in November 1901, along with the rest of the Exposition&#x27;s temporary structures. A stone marker in the median of Fordham Drive, now a residential street in Buffalo, marks the approximate spot () where the shooting occurred. Czolgosz&#x27;s revolver is on display in the Pan-American Exposition exhibit at the Buffalo History Museum in Buffalo.

After Czolgosz&#x27;s death, Lloyd Vernon Briggs (1863–1941), a Boston alienist who later became the Director of the Massachusetts Department for Mental Hygiene, reviewed the Czolgosz case in 1901 on behalf of psychiatrist Walter Channing (1849–1921), concluding Czolgosz was insane; that conclusion has since been challenged.

Czolgosz is buried at Soule Cemetery in Cayuga County, New York. His grave is unmarked, with a stone reading, &quot;Fort Hill Remains&quot;.

<doc id="176472" wikidata="Q620579" url="?curid=176472" title="Smurf attack">
<text>A Smurf attack is a distributed denial-of-service attack in which large numbers of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets with the intended victim&#x27;s spoofed source IP are broadcast to a computer network using an IP broadcast address. Most devices on a network will, by default, respond to this by sending a reply to the source IP address. If the number of machines on the network that receive and respond to these packets is very large, the victim&#x27;s computer will be flooded with traffic. This can slow down the victim&#x27;s computer to the point where it becomes impossible to work on.

==History==
The original tool for creating a Smurf attack was written by Dan Moschuk (alias TFreak) in 1997.

In the late 1990s, many IP networks would participate in Smurf attacks if prompted (that is, they would respond to ICMP requests sent to broadcast addresses). The name comes from the idea of very small, but numerous attackers overwhelming a much larger opponent (see Smurfs). Today, administrators can make a network immune to such abuse; therefore, very few networks remain vulnerable to Smurf attacks.

==Method==
A Smurf amplifier is a computer network that lends itself to being used in a Smurf attack. Smurf amplifiers act to worsen the severity of a Smurf attack because they are configured in such a way that they generate a large number of ICMP replies to the victim at the spoofed source IP address. 

In DDoS, &quot;amplification&quot; is the degree of bandwidth enhancement that an original attack traffic undergoes (with the help of Smurf amplifiers) during its transmission towards the victim computer. An amplification factor of 100, for example, means that an attacker could manage to create 100 Mb/s of traffic using just 1 Mb/s of its own bandwidth.

Under the assumption no countermeasures are taken to dampen the effect of a Smurf attack, this is what happens in the target network with &quot;n&quot; active hosts (that will respond to ICMP echo requests).
The ICMP echo request packets have a spoofed source address (the Smurfs&#x27; target) and a destination address (the patsy; the apparent source of the attack). Both addresses can take two forms: unicast and broadcast.

The dual unicast form is comparable with a regular ping: an ICMP echo request is sent to the patsy (a single host), which sends a single ICMP echo reply (a Smurf) back to the target (the single host in the source address). This type of attack has an amplification factor of 1, which means: just a single Smurf per ping.

When the target is a unicast address and the destination is the broadcast address of the target&#x27;s network, then all hosts in the network will receive an echo request. In return they will each reply to the target, so the target is swamped with &quot;n&quot; Smurfs. Amplification factor = &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; is small, a host may be hindered but not crippled. If &quot;n&quot; is large, a host may come to a halt.

If the target is the broadcast address and the patsy a unicast address, each host in the network will receive a single Smurf per ping, so an amplification factor of 1 per host, but a factor of &quot;n&quot; for the network. Generally, a network would be able to cope with this form of the attack, if &quot;n&quot; is not too great.

When both the source and destination address in the original packet are set to the broadcast address of the target network, things start to get out of hand quickly. All hosts receive an echo request, but all replies to that are broadcast again to all hosts. Each host will receive an initial ping, broadcast the reply and get a reply from all &quot;n-1&quot; hosts. An amplification factor of &quot;n&quot; for a single host, but an amplification factor of &quot;n2&quot; for the network.

ICMP echo requests are typically sent once a second. The reply should contain the contents of the request; a few bytes, normally. A single (double broadcast) ping to a network with 100 hosts causes the network to process packets. If the payload of the ping is increased to bytes (or 10 full packets in Ethernet) then that ping will cause the network to have to process large packets per second. Send more packets per second, and any network would collapse under the load. This will render any host in the network unreachable for as long as the attack lasts.

==Effect==
A Smurf attack can overwhelm servers and networks. The bandwidth of the communication network can be exhausted resulting in the communication network becoming paralyzed.

==Mitigation==
The fix is two-fold:
#Configure hosts and routers to ignore packets where the destination address is a broadcast address; and
#Configure routers to not forward packets directed to broadcast addresses. Until 1999, standards required routers to forward such packets by default. Since then, the default standard was changed to not forward such packets.

It&#x27;s also important for ISPs to implement ingress filtering, which rejects the attacking packets on the basis of the forged source address.

===Mitigation on a Cisco router===
An example of configuring a router so it will not forward packets to broadcast addresses, for a Cisco router, is:

(This example does not protect a network from becoming the &quot;target&quot; of a Smurf attack; it merely prevents the network from &quot;participating&quot; in a Smurf attack.)

==Fraggle attack==
A Fraggle attack (named for the creatures in the puppet TV series &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;) is a variation of a Smurf attack where an attacker sends a large amount of UDP traffic to ports 7 (Echo) and 19 (CHARGEN). It works similarly to the Smurf attack in that many computers on the network will respond to this traffic by sending traffic back to the spoofed source IP of the victim, flooding it with traffic.

, the source code of the attack, was also released by TFreak.

<doc id="176474" wikidata="Q1811622" url="?curid=176474" title="The Last Poets">
<text>The Last Poets is a poetry collective and musical group that arose in the late 1960s as part of the African-American civil rights movement and black nationalism. The name was inspired by revolutionary South African poet Keorapetse Kgositsile who believed he was in the last era of poetry before guns took over.

The group originally comprised Jalaluddin Mansur Nuriddin, Umar Bin Hassan and Abiodun Oyewole. Lineup changes and departures led to offshoots, including The Original Last Poets composed of Oyewole, Gylan Kain and David Nelson. The versions of the group led by Nuriddin and Hassan had the largest impact on popular culture. The Last Poets were one of the earliest influences on hip-hop music. Critic Jason Ankeny wrote: &quot;With their politically charged raps, taut rhythms, and dedication to raising African-American consciousness, the Last Poets almost single-handedly laid the groundwork for the emergence of hip-hop.&quot; The British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; stated, &quot;Serious spokesmen like Gil Scott-Heron, The Last Poets, and later Gary Byrd, paved the way for the many socially committed Black [emcees] a decade later.&quot; 

==History==
===Origins and 1970s===
Jalal Mansur Nuriddin a.k.a. Alafia Pudim, Umar Bin Hassan, and Abiodun Oyewole, along with poet Sulaiman El-Hadi and percussionist Nilaja Obabi (Raymond &quot;Mac&quot; Hurrey), are generally considered the best-known members of the various lineups. Jalal, Abiodun, Umar, and Nilaja appeared on the group&#x27;s 1970 self-titled debut LP and follow-up &quot;This Is Madness&quot; featured all but Abiodun, due to his incarceration for political activism. On the third album &quot;Chastisement&quot; a third poet, Sulaiman El-Hadi, was added, then Nilija left and the African rhythms began to be replaced by jazzier backgrounds. The Jalal-Sulaiman version of the group made six albums together but recorded only sporadically without much promotion after 1977.

The Original Last Poets were formed on 19 May 1968, the birthday of Malcolm X, at Mount Morris Park (now known as Marcus Garvey Park) in East Harlem, New York City. The original group consisted of Gylan Kain, David Nelson and Abiodun Oyewole. The group coalesced via a 1969 Harlem writers&#x27; workshop known as East Wind. On 24 October that year, the group performed on pioneering New York television program &quot;Soul!&quot;. 
The Last Poets contributed &quot;Wake Up, Niggers&quot; to the soundtrack of &quot;Performance&quot;, a 1970 film featuring Mick Jagger.

When Nelson left, he was replaced by Felipe Luciano, who would later leave to establish the Young Lords. When Kain and Nelson began to pursue other interests (theater and ministry respectively), Abiodun Oyewole &quot;recruited&quot; Alafia Pudim (later known as Jalaluddin Mansur) and Umar bin Hassan. Following the success of the newly refigured Last Poets first album, founding members Kain and Nelson got together with Luciano and recorded their only album &quot;Right On&quot; in 1970, the soundtrack to a documentary movie of the same name that finally saw release in 1971. Luciano, Kain, Abiodune Oyewole and Nelson recorded separately as The Original Last Poets, gaining some renown as the soundtrack artists (without Oyewole) of the 1971 film &quot;Right On!&quot; Following a legal battle between the two groups concerning ownership of the band&#x27;s name, The &quot;Right On&quot; album was released under the group name The Original Last Poets to simultaneously establish the founding members&#x27; primacy and distance themselves from the other group of the same name.

In 1972, they appeared on Black Forum Records album &quot;Black Spirits - Festival Of New Black Poets In America&quot; with &quot;And See Her Image In The River&quot; and &quot;Song of Ditla, part II&quot;, recorded live at the Apollo Theatre, Harlem, New York. A book of the same name was published by Random House (1972 - ).

Having reached US Top 10 chart success with its debut album, the Last Poets went on to release the follow-up, &quot;This Is Madness&quot;, without then-incarcerated Abiodun Oyewole. The album featured more politically charged poetry that resulted in the group being listed under the counter-intelligence program COINTELPRO during the Richard Nixon administration. Hassan left the group following &quot;This Is Madness&quot; to be replaced by Sulaiman El-Hadi in time for &quot;Chastisment&quot; (1972). The album introduced a sound the group called &quot;jazzoetry&quot;, leaving behind the spare percussion of the previous albums in favor of a blending of jazz and funk instrumentation with poetry. The music further developed into free-jazz–poetry with Hassan&#x27;s brief return on Blue Thumb album &quot;At Last&quot; (1973), as yet the only Last Poets release still unavailable on CD.

The remainder of the 1970s saw a decline in the group&#x27;s popularity in America, although they became quite popular in Europe.

===1980s and 1990s===
In the 1980s and beyond, however, the group gained renown with the rise of hip-hop music, often being name-checked as grandfathers and founders of the new movement, often citing the Jalaluddin solo project &quot;Hustler&#x27;s Convention&quot; (1973) as their inspiration. Because of this the band was interviewed in the 1986 cult documentary &quot;Big Fun In The Big Town&quot;. Nuriddin and El-Hadi worked on several projects under the Last Poets name, working with bassist and producer Bill Laswell, including 1984&#x27;s &quot;Oh My People&quot; and 1988&#x27;s &quot; Freedom Express&quot;, and recording the final El Hadi–Nuriddin collaboration, &quot;Scatterrap/Home&quot;, in 1994. The group, El Hadi, Nuriddin and Hassan, also made a guest appearance in John Singleton&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;. Prominent Attorney Gregory J Reed reunited Original Poets in NY the same day of Nelson Mandela was released from prison after 27 years and recorded &quot;Poets Live&quot; in Detroit&#x27;s Orchestra Hall, and produced &quot;The Return of the Original Last Poets Docudrama&quot; Kain, Luciano, Oyewole and Nelson after 20 years in 1990.

Sulaiman El-Hadi died in October 1995. Oyewole and Hassan began recording separately under the same name, releasing &quot;Holy Terror&quot; in 1995 (re-released on Innerhythmic in 2004) and &quot;Time Has Come&quot; in 1997. Meanwhile, Nuriddin released the solo CD&#x27;s &quot;On The One&quot; (1996), &quot;The Fruits of Rap&quot; (1997) and &quot;Science Friction&quot; (2004) under the abbreviated name &quot;Jalal.&quot;

===21st century===
In 2005, the Last Poets found fame again refreshed through a collaboration where the trio (Umar Bin Hassan) was featured with hip-hop artist Common on the Kanye West-produced song &quot;The Corner,&quot; as well as (Abiodun Oyewole) with the Wu-Tang Clan-affiliated political hip-hop group Black Market Militia on the song &quot;The Final Call,&quot; stretching overseas to the UK on songs &quot;Organic Liquorice (Natural Woman)&quot;, &quot;Voodoocore&quot;, and &quot;A Name&quot; with Shaka Amazulu the 7th. The group is also featured on the Nas album &quot;Untitled&quot;, on the songs &quot;You Can&#x27;t Stop Us Now&quot; and &quot;Project Roach.&quot; Individual members of the group also collaborated with DST on a remake of &quot;Mean Machine&quot;, Public Enemy on a remake of &quot;White Man&#x27;s Got A God Complex&quot; and with Bristol-based post-punk band the Pop Group.

In 2010, Abiodun Oyowele was among the artists featured on the Welfare Poets&#x27; produced &quot;Cruel And Unusual Punishment&quot;, a CD compilation that was made in protest of the death penalty, which also featured some several current positive hip hop artists.

In 2004 Jalal Mansur Nuriddin, a.k.a. Alafia Pudim, a.k.a. Lightning Rod (The Hustlers Convention 1973), collaborated with the UK-based poet Mark T. Watson (a.k.a. Malik Al Nasir) writing the foreword to Watson&#x27;s debut poetry collection, &quot;Ordinary Guy&quot;, published in December 2004 by the Liverpool-based publisher Fore-Word Press. Jalal&#x27;s foreword was written in rhyme, and was recorded for a collaborative album &quot;Rhythms of the Diaspora (Vol. 1 &amp; 2 - Unreleased) by Malik Al Nasir&#x27;s band, Malik &amp; the O.G&#x27;s featuring Gil Scott-Heron, percussionist Larry McDonald, drummers Rod Youngs and Swiss Chris, New York dub poet Ras Tesfa, and a host of young rappers from New York and Washington, D.C. Produced by Malik Al Nasir, and Swiss Chris, the albums &quot;Rhythms of the Diaspora; Vol. 1 &amp; 2&quot; are the first of their kind to unite these pioneers of poetry and hip hop with each other.

In 2011, Abiodun Oyewole and Umar Bin Hassan performed at The Jazz Cafe in London, in a tribute concert to the late Scott-Heron and all the former Last Poets. In 2014, Nuriddin performed at the same venue with Jazz Warriors, the first live performance in 40 years of the &quot;Hustlers Convention&quot;. The event was produced by Fore-Word Press and featured Liverpool poet Malik Al Nasir with his band Malik &amp; the O.G&#x27;s featuring Cleveland Watkiss, Orphy Robinson and Tony Remy. The event was filmed as part of a documentary on the &quot;Hustlers Convention&quot; by Manchester film maker Mike Todd and Riverhorse Communications. The executive producer was Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D. As part of the event Charly Records re-issued a special limited edition of the vinyl version of Hustlers Convention to celebrate their 40th anniversary. The event was MC&#x27;d by poet Lemn Sissay and the DJ was Shiftless Shuffle&#x27;s Perry Louis.

In 2016, &quot;The Last Poets&quot; (World Editions, UK), was published. The novel, written by Christine Otten , was originally published in Dutch in 2011, and has now been translated by Jonathan Reeder for English readers.

In May 2018, The Last Poets released &quot;Understand What Black Is&quot;, their first album since 1997. The album featured tributes to late artists Prince and Biggie Smalls.

In August 2022, numerous samples from The Last Poet &quot;Mean Machine&quot; were used in JID&#x27;s &quot;Raydar&quot; In reference to the poet&#x27;s lines about weapons, peace, and harmony.

<doc id="176478" wikidata="Q1156903" url="?curid=176478" title="Riemann sum">
<text>In mathematics, a Riemann sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum. It is named after nineteenth century German mathematician Bernhard Riemann. One very common application is in numerical integration, i.e., approximating the area of functions or lines on a graph, where it is also known as the rectangle rule. It can also be applied for approximating the length of curves and other approximations. 

The sum is calculated by partitioning the region into shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas, or cubics—sometimes infinitesimally small) that together form a region that is similar to the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes, and finally adding all of these small areas together. This approach can be used to find a numerical approximation for a definite integral even if the fundamental theorem of calculus does not make it easy to find a closed-form solution.

Because the region by the small shapes is usually not exactly the same shape as the region being measured, the Riemann sum will differ from the area being measured. This error can be reduced by dividing up the region more finely, using smaller and smaller shapes. As the shapes get smaller and smaller, the sum approaches the Riemann integral.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a function defined on a closed interval formula_2 of the real numbers, formula_3, and formula_4 as a partition of formula_2, that is
formula_6
A Riemann sum formula_7 of formula_8 over formula_2 with partition formula_10 is defined as
formula_11
where formula_12 and formula_13.
One might produce different Riemann sums depending on which formula_14&#x27;s are chosen. In the end this will not matter, if the function is Riemann integrable, when the difference or width of the summands formula_15 approaches zero.

== Types of Riemann sums ==
Specific choices of formula_14 give different types of Riemann sums:
* If formula_17 for all &quot;i&quot;, the method is the left rule and gives a left Riemann sum.
* If formula_18 for all &quot;i&quot;, the method is the right rule and gives a right Riemann sum.
* If formula_19 for all &quot;i&quot;, the method is the midpoint rule and gives a middle Riemann sum.
* If formula_20 (that is, the supremum offormula_21 over formula_22), the method is the upper rule and gives an upper Riemann sum or upper Darboux sum.
* If formula_23 (that is, the infimum of &quot;f&quot; over formula_22), the method is the lower rule and gives a lower Riemann sum or lower Darboux sum.

All these Riemann summation methods are among the most basic ways to accomplish numerical integration. Loosely speaking, a function is Riemann integrable if all Riemann sums converge as the partition &quot;gets finer and finer&quot;.

While not derived as a Riemann sum, taking the average of the left and right Riemann sums is the trapezoidal rule and gives a trapezoidal sum. It is one of the simplest of a very general way of approximating integrals using weighted averages. This is followed in complexity by Simpson&#x27;s rule and Newton–Cotes formulas.

Any Riemann sum on a given partition (that is, for any choice of formula_14 between formula_26 and formula_27) is contained between the lower and upper Darboux sums. This forms the basis of the Darboux integral, which is ultimately equivalent to the Riemann integral.

== Riemann summation methods ==
The four Riemann summation methods are usually best approached with subintervals of equal size. The interval is therefore divided into formula_28 subintervals, each of length
formula_29

The points in the partition will then be
formula_30

=== Left rule ===

For the left rule, the function is approximated by its values at the left endpoints of the subintervals. This gives multiple rectangles with base and height . Doing this for , and summing the resulting areas gives
formula_31

The left Riemann sum amounts to an overestimation if &quot;f&quot; is monotonically decreasing on this interval, and an underestimation if it is monotonically increasing.
The error of this formula will be 
formula_32
where formula_33 is the maximum value of the absolute value of formula_34 over the interval.

=== Right rule ===

For the right rule, the function is approximated by its values at the right endpoints of the subintervals. This gives multiple rectangles with base and height . Doing this for , and summing the resulting areas gives
formula_35

The right Riemann sum amounts to an underestimation if &quot;f&quot; is monotonically decreasing, and an overestimation if it is monotonically increasing.
The error of this formula will be 
formula_36
where formula_33 is the maximum value of the absolute value of formula_34 over the interval.

=== Midpoint rule ===

For the midpoint rule, the function is approximated by its values at the midpoints of the subintervals. This gives for the first subinterval, for the next one, and so on until . Summing the resulting areas gives
formula_39

The error of this formula will be
formula_40
where formula_41 is the maximum value of the absolute value of formula_42 over the interval. This error is half of that of the trapezoidal sum; as such the middle Riemann sum is the most accurate approach to the Riemann sum.
==== Generalized midpoint rule ====
A generalized midpoint rule formula, also known as the enhanced midpoint integration, is given by
formula_43
where formula_44 denotes even derivative.

For a function formula_45 defined over interval formula_46, its integral is
formula_47
Therefore, we can apply this generalized midpoint integration formula by assuming that formula_48. This formula is particularly efficient for the numerical integration when the integrand formula_49 is a highly oscillating function.

=== Trapezoidal rule ===
For the trapezoidal rule, the function is approximated by the average of its values at the left and right endpoints of the subintervals. Using the area formula formula_50 for a trapezium with parallel sides and , and height , and summing the resulting areas gives
formula_51

The error of this formula will be
formula_52
where formula_41 is the maximum value of the absolute value of formula_54.

The approximation obtained with the trapezoidal sum for a function is the same as the average of the left hand and right hand sums of that function.

== Connection with integration ==
For a one-dimensional Riemann sum over domain formula_2, as the maximum size of a subinterval shrinks to zero (that is the limit of the norm of the subintervals goes to zero), some functions will have all Riemann sums converge to the same value. This limiting value, if it exists, is defined as the definite Riemann integral of the function over the domain,
formula_56

For a finite-sized domain, if the maximum size of a subinterval shrinks to zero, this implies the number of subinterval goes to infinity. For finite partitions, Riemann sums are always approximations to the limiting value and this approximation gets better as the partition gets finer. The following animations help demonstrate how increasing the number of subintervals (while lowering the maximum subinterval size) better approximates the &quot;area&quot; under the curve:

Since the red function here is assumed to be a smooth function, all three Riemann sums will converge to the same value as the number of subintervals goes to infinity.

== Example ==
Taking an example, the area under the curve over [0, 2] can be procedurally computed using Riemann&#x27;s method. 

The interval [0, 2] is firstly divided into subintervals, each of which is given a width of formula_57; these are the widths of the Riemann rectangles (hereafter &quot;boxes&quot;). Because the right Riemann sum is to be used, the sequence of coordinates for the boxes will be formula_58. Therefore, the sequence of the heights of the boxes will be formula_59. It is an important fact that formula_60, and formula_61.

The area of each box will be formula_62 and therefore the &quot;n&quot;th right Riemann sum will be: 
formula_63

If the limit is viewed as &quot;n&quot; → ∞, it can be concluded that the approximation approaches the actual value of the area under the curve as the number of boxes increases. Hence:
formula_64

This method agrees with the definite integral as calculated in more mechanical ways:
formula_65

Because the function is continuous and monotonically increasing over the interval, a right Riemann sum overestimates the integral by the largest amount (while a left Riemann sum would underestimate the integral by the largest amount). This fact, which is intuitively clear from the diagrams, shows how the nature of the function determines how accurate the integral is estimated. While simple, right and left Riemann sums are often less accurate than more advanced techniques of estimating an integral such as the Trapezoidal rule or Simpson&#x27;s rule.

The example function has an easy-to-find anti-derivative so estimating the integral by Riemann sums is mostly an academic exercise; however it must be remembered that not all functions have anti-derivatives so estimating their integrals by summation is practically important.


== Higher dimensions ==
The basic idea behind a Riemann sum is to &quot;break-up&quot; the domain via a partition into pieces, multiply the &quot;size&quot; of each piece by some value the function takes on that piece, and sum all these products. This can be generalized to allow Riemann sums for functions over domains of more than one dimension.

While intuitively, the process of partitioning the domain is easy to grasp, the technical details of how the domain may be partitioned get much more complicated than the one dimensional case and involves aspects of the geometrical shape of the domain.

=== Two dimensions ===
In two dimensions, the domain formula_66 may be divided into a number of two-dimensional cells formula_67 such that formula_68. Each cell then can be interpreted as having an &quot;area&quot; denoted by formula_69. The two-dimensional Riemann sum is
formula_70
where formula_71.

=== Three dimensions ===
In three dimensions, the domain formula_72 is partitioned into a number of three-dimensional cells formula_73 such that formula_74. Each cell then can be interpreted as having a &quot;volume&quot; denoted by formula_75. The three-dimensional Riemann sum is
formula_76
where formula_77.

=== Arbitrary number of dimensions ===
Higher dimensional Riemann sums follow a similar pattern. An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemann sum is
formula_78
where formula_79, that is, it is a point in the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cell formula_73 with &quot;n&quot;-dimensional volume formula_75.

=== Generalization ===
In high generality, Riemann sums can be written
formula_82
where formula_83 stands for any arbitrary point contained in the set formula_73 and formula_85 is a measure on the underlying set. Roughly speaking, a measure is a function that gives a &quot;size&quot; of a set, in this case the size of the set formula_73; in one dimension this can often be interpreted as a length, in two dimensions as an area, in three dimensions as a volume, and so on.

<doc id="176479" wikidata="Q378858" url="?curid=176479" title="Gil Scott-Heron">
<text>Gilbert Scott-Heron (April 1, 1949 – May 27, 2011) was an American jazz poet, singer, musician, and author known for his work as a spoken-word performer in the 1970s and 1980s. His collaborative efforts with musician Brian Jackson fused jazz, blues, and soul with lyrics relative to social and political issues of the time, delivered in both rapping and melismatic vocal styles. He referred to himself as a &quot;bluesologist&quot;, his own term for &quot;a scientist who is concerned with the origin of the blues&quot;. His poem &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;, delivered over a jazz-soul beat, is considered a major influence on hip hop music.

Scott-Heron&#x27;s music, particularly on the albums &quot;Pieces of a Man&quot; and &quot;Winter in America&quot; during the early 1970s, influenced and foreshadowed later African-American music genres, including hip hop and neo soul. His recording work received much critical acclaim, especially for &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush called him &quot;one of the most important progenitors of rap music&quot;, stating that &quot;his aggressive, no-nonsense street poetry inspired a legion of intelligent rappers while his engaging songwriting skills placed him square in the R&amp;B charts later in his career.&quot;

Scott-Heron remained active until his death, and in 2010 released his first new album in 16 years, titled &quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot;. A memoir he had been working on for years up to the time of his death, &quot;The Last Holiday&quot;, was published posthumously in January 2012. Scott-Heron received a posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. He also is included in the exhibits at the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) that officially opened on September 24, 2016, on the National Mall, and in an NMAAHC publication, &quot;Dream a World Anew&quot;. In 2021, Scott-Heron was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a recipient of the Early Influence Award.

==Early years==
Gil Scott-Heron was born in Chicago. His mother, Bobbie Scott, born in Mississippi, was an opera singer who performed with the Oratorio Society of New York. His father, Gil Heron, nicknamed &quot;The Black Arrow&quot;, was a Jamaican footballer who in the 1950s became the first black man to play for Celtic F.C. in Glasgow, Scotland. Gil&#x27;s parents separated in his early childhood and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in Jackson, Tennessee. When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he returned to live with his mother in The Bronx in New York City. He enrolled at DeWitt Clinton High School but later transferred to The Fieldston School, after impressing the head of the English department with some of his writings and earning a full scholarship. As one of five Black students at the prestigious school, Scott-Heron was faced with alienation and a significant socioeconomic gap. During his admissions interview at Fieldston, an administrator asked him: How would you feel if you see one of your classmates go by in a limousine while you&#x27;re walking up the hill from the subway?&#x27; And [he] said, &#x27;Same way as you. Y&#x27;all can&#x27;t afford no limousine. How do you feel? This type of intractable boldness would become a hallmark of Scott-Heron&#x27;s later recordings.

After completing his secondary education, Scott-Heron decided to attend Lincoln University in Oxford, Pennsylvania because Langston Hughes (his most important literary influence) was an alumnus. It was here that Scott-Heron met Brian Jackson, with whom he formed the band Black &amp; Blues. After about two years at Lincoln, Scott-Heron took a year off to write the novels &quot;The Vulture&quot; and &quot;The Nigger Factory&quot;. Scott-Heron was very heavily influenced by the Black Arts Movement (BAM). The Last Poets, a group associated with the Black Arts Movement, performed at Lincoln in 1969 and Abiodun Oyewole of that Harlem group said Scott-Heron asked him after the performance, &quot;Listen, can I start a group like you guys?&quot; Scott-Heron returned to New York City, settling in Chelsea, Manhattan. &quot;The Vulture&quot; was published by the World Publishing Company in 1970 to positive reviews.

Although Scott-Heron never completed his undergraduate degree, he was admitted to the Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University, where he received an M.A. in creative writing in 1972. His master&#x27;s thesis was titled &quot;Circle of Stone&quot;. Beginning in 1972, Scott-Heron taught literature and creative writing for several years as a full-time lecturer at University of the District of Columbia (then known as Federal City College) in Washington, D.C., while maintaining his music career.

==Recording career==
Scott-Heron began his recording career with the LP &quot;Small Talk at 125th and Lenox&quot; in 1970. Bob Thiele of Flying Dutchman Records produced the album, and Scott-Heron was accompanied by Eddie Knowles and Charlie Saunders on conga and David Barnes on percussion and vocals. The album&#x27;s 14 tracks dealt with themes such as the superficiality of television and mass consumerism, the hypocrisy of some would-be black revolutionaries, and white middle-class ignorance of the difficulties faced by inner-city residents. The album also included the spoken-word poem &quot;Whitey on the Moon&quot;. In the liner notes, Scott-Heron acknowledged as influences Richie Havens, John Coltrane, Otis Redding, Jose Feliciano, Billie Holiday, Langston Hughes, Malcolm X, Huey Newton, Nina Simone, and long-time collaborator Brian Jackson.

Scott-Heron&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Pieces of a Man&quot; used more conventional song structures than the loose, spoken-word feel of &quot;Small Talk&quot;. He was joined by Jackson, Johnny Pate as conductor, Ron Carter on bass and bass guitar, drummer Bernard &quot;Pretty&quot; Purdie, Burt Jones playing electric guitar, and Hubert Laws on flute and saxophone, with Thiele producing again. Scott-Heron&#x27;s third album, &quot;Free Will&quot;, was released in 1972. Jackson, Purdie, Laws, Knowles, and Saunders all returned to play on &quot;Free Will&quot; and were joined by Jerry Jemmott playing bass, David Spinozza on guitar, and Horace Ott (arranger and conductor). Carter later said about Scott-Heron&#x27;s voice: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t a great singer, but, with that voice, if he had whispered it would have been dynamic. It was a voice like you would have for Shakespeare.&quot;
In 1974, he recorded another collaboration with Brian Jackson, &quot;Winter in America&quot;, with Bob Adams on drums and Danny Bowens on bass. &quot;Winter in America&quot; has been regarded by many critics as the two musicians&#x27; most artistic effort. The following year, Scott-Heron and Jackson released &quot;Midnight Band: The First Minute of a New Day&quot;. In 1975, he released the single &quot;Johannesburg&quot;, a rallying cry for the end of apartheid in South Africa. The song would be re-issued, in 12&quot;-single form, together with &quot;Waiting for the Axe to Fall&quot; and &quot;B-movie&quot; in 1983.

A live album, &quot;It&#x27;s Your World&quot;, followed in 1976 and a recording of spoken poetry, &quot;The Mind of Gil Scott-Heron&quot;, was released in 1978. Another success followed with the hit single &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, which he recorded as a single with producer Malcolm Cecil. &quot;Angel Dust&quot; peaked at No. 15 on the R&amp;B charts in 1978.

In 1979, Scott-Heron played at the No Nukes concerts at Madison Square Garden. The concerts were organized by Musicians United for Safe Energy to protest the use of nuclear energy following the Three Mile Island accident. Scott-Heron&#x27;s song &quot;We Almost Lost Detroit&quot; was included in the &quot;No Nukes&quot; album of concert highlights. It alluded to a previous nuclear power plant accident and was also the title of a book by John G. Fuller. Scott-Heron was a frequent critic of President Ronald Reagan and his conservative policies.

Scott-Heron recorded and released four albums during the 1980s: &quot;1980&quot; and &quot;Real Eyes&quot; (1980), &quot;Reflections&quot; (1981) and &quot;Moving Target&quot; (1982). In February 1982, Ron Holloway joined the ensemble to play tenor saxophone. He toured extensively with Scott-Heron and contributed to his next album, &quot;Moving Target&quot; the same year. His tenor accompaniment is a prominent feature of the songs &quot;Fast Lane&quot; and &quot;Black History/The World&quot;. Holloway continued with Scott-Heron until the summer of 1989, when he left to join Dizzy Gillespie. Several years later, Scott-Heron would make cameo appearances on two of Ron Holloway&#x27;s CDs: &quot;Scorcher&quot; (1996) and &quot;Groove Update&quot; (1998), both on the Fantasy/Milestone label.

Scott-Heron was dropped by Arista Records in 1985 and quit recording, though he continued to tour. The same year, he helped compose and sang &quot;Let Me See Your I.D.&quot; on the Artists United Against Apartheid album &quot;Sun City&quot;, containing the famous line: &quot;The first time I heard there was trouble in the Middle East, I thought they were talking about Pittsburgh.&quot; The song compares racial tensions in the U.S. with those in apartheid-era South Africa, implying that the U.S. was not too far ahead in race relations. In 1993, he signed to TVT Records and released &quot;Spirits&quot;, an album that included the seminal track &quot;&#x27;Message to the Messengers&quot;. The first track on the album criticized the rap artists of the day. Scott-Heron is known in many circles as &quot;the Godfather of rap&quot; and is widely considered to be one of the genre&#x27;s founding fathers. Given the political consciousness that lies at the foundation of his work, he can also be called a founder of political rap. &quot;Message to the Messengers&quot; was a plea for the new generation of rappers to speak for change rather than perpetuate the current social situation, and to be more articulate and artistic. Regarding hip hop music in the 1990s, he said in an interview: 

==Later years==
===Prison terms and more performing===
In 2001, Scott-Heron was sentenced to one to three years imprisonment in a New York State prison for possession of cocaine. While out of jail in 2002, he appeared on the &quot;Blazing Arrow&quot; album by Blackalicious. He was released on parole in 2003, the year BBC TV broadcast the documentary &quot;Gil Scott-Heron: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;. Scott-Heron was arrested for possession of a crack pipe during the editing of the film in October 2003 and received a six-month prison sentence.

On July 5, 2006, Scott-Heron was sentenced to two to four years in a New York State prison for violating a plea deal on a drug-possession charge by leaving a drug rehabilitation center. He claimed that he left because the clinic refused to supply him with HIV medication. This story led to the presumption that the artist was HIV positive, subsequently confirmed in a 2008 interview. Originally sentenced to serve until July 13, 2009, he was paroled on May 23, 2007.

After his release, Scott-Heron began performing live again, starting with a show at SOB&#x27;s restaurant and nightclub in New York on September 13, 2007. On stage, he stated that he and his musicians were working on a new album and that he had resumed writing a book titled &quot;The Last Holiday&quot;, previously on long-term hiatus, about Stevie Wonder and his successful attempt to have the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. declared a federally recognized holiday in the United States.

Malik Al Nasir dedicated a collection of poetry to Scott-Heron titled &quot;Ordinary Guy&quot; that contained a foreword by Jalal Mansur Nuriddin of The Last Poets. Scott-Heron recorded one of the poems in Nasir&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot; in 2006.

In April 2009, on BBC Radio 4, poet Lemn Sissay presented a half-hour documentary on Gil Scott-Heron entitled &quot;Pieces of a Man&quot;, having interviewed Gil Scott-Heron in New York a month earlier. &quot;Pieces of a Man&quot; was the first UK announcement from Scott-Heron of his forthcoming album and return to form. In November 2009, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; interviewed Scott-Heron for a feature titled &quot;The Legendary Godfather of Rap Returns&quot;. In 2009, a new Gil Scott-Heron website, gilscottheron.net, was launched with a new track &quot;Where Did the Night Go&quot; made available as a free download from the site.

In 2010, Scott-Heron was booked to perform in Tel Aviv, Israel, but this attracted criticism from pro-Palestinian activists, who stated: &quot;Your performance in Israel would be the equivalent to having performed in Sun City during South Africa&#x27;s apartheid era... We hope that you will not play apartheid Israel&quot;. Scott-Heron responded by canceling the performance.

===&quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot;===
Scott-Heron released his album &quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot; on independent label XL Recordings on February 9, 2010. Produced by XL label owner Richard Russell, &quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot; was Scott-Heron&#x27;s first studio album in 16 years. The pair began recording in 2007, but the majority of the album was recorded over the 12 months leading up to the release date, with engineer Lawson White at Clinton Studios in New York. &quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot; is 28 minutes long with 15 tracks; however, casual asides and observations collected during recording sessions are included as interludes.

The album attracted critical acclaim, with &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Jude Rogers declaring it one of the &quot;best of the next decade&quot;, while some have called the record &quot;reverent&quot; and &quot;intimate&quot;, due to Scott-Heron&#x27;s half-sung, half-spoken delivery of his poetry. In a music review for public radio network NPR, Will Hermes stated: &quot;Comeback records always worry me, especially when they&#x27;re made by one of my heroes ... But I was haunted by this record ... He&#x27;s made a record not without hope but which doesn&#x27;t come with any easy or comforting answers. In that way, the man is clearly still committed to speaking the truth&quot;. Writing for music website &quot;Music OMH&quot;, Darren Lee provided a more mixed assessment of the album, describing it as rewarding and stunning, but he also states that the album&#x27;s brevity prevents it &quot;from being an unassailable masterpiece&quot;.

Scott-Heron described himself as a mere participant, in a 2010 interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;:
This is Richard&#x27;s CD. My only knowledge when I got to the studio was how he seemed to have wanted this for a long time. You&#x27;re in a position to have somebody do something that they really want to do, and it was not something that would hurt me or damage me—why not? All the dreams you show up in are not your own.

The remix version of the album, &quot;We&#x27;re New Here&quot;, was released in 2011, featuring production by English musician Jamie xx, who reworked material from the original album. Like the original album, &quot;We&#x27;re New Here&quot; received critical acclaim.

In April 2014, XL Recordings announced a third album from the &quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot; sessions, titled &quot;Nothing New&quot;. The album consists of stripped-down piano and vocal recordings and was released in conjunction with Record Store Day on April 19, 2014.

==Death==
Scott-Heron died on May 27, 2011, in New York City after a trip to Europe. Scott-Heron had confirmed press speculation about his health when he disclosed in a 2008 &quot;New York Magazine&quot; interview that he had been HIV-positive for several years, and that he had been previously hospitalized for pneumonia.
He was survived by his first-born daughter Raquiyah &quot;Nia&quot; Kelly Heron from his relationship with fellow writer, Pat Kelly, his son Rumal Rackley from his relationship with Lurma Rackley, daughter Gia Scott-Heron from his marriage to Brenda Sykes, and daughter Chegianna Newton, who was 13 years old at the time of her father&#x27;s death. He was also survived by his sister Gayle, brother Denis Heron who once managed Scott-Heron, his uncle Roy Heron, and nephew Terrance Kelly, an actor and rapper who performs as Mr. Cheeks and is a member of Lost Boyz.

Before his death Scott-Heron had been in talks with Portuguese director Pedro Costa over his film &quot;Horse Money&quot; to be screenwriter, composer and an actor.

In response to Scott-Heron&#x27;s death, Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D stated &quot;RIP GSH...and we do what we do and how we do because of you&quot; on his Twitter account. His UK publisher, Jamie Byng, called him &quot;one of the most inspiring people I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;. On hearing of the death, R&amp;B singer Usher stated: &quot;I just learned of the loss of a very important poet...R.I.P., Gil Scott-Heron. The revolution will be live!!&quot;. Richard Russell, who produced Scott-Heron&#x27;s final studio album, called him a &quot;father figure of sorts to me&quot;, while Eminem said &quot;He influenced all of hip-hop&quot;. Lupe Fiasco wrote a poem about Scott-Heron that was published on his website.

Scott-Heron&#x27;s memorial service was held at Riverside Church in New York City on June 2, 2011, where Kanye West performed &quot;Lost in the World&quot; and &quot;Who Will Survive in America&quot;, two songs from West&#x27;s album &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. The studio album version of West&#x27;s &quot;Who Will Survive in America&quot; features a spoken-word excerpt by Scott-Heron. Scott-Heron is buried at Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County in New York.

Scott-Heron was honored posthumously in 2012 by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Charlotte Fox, member of the Washington, DC NARAS and president of Genesis Poets Music, nominated Scott-Heron for the award while a letter of support came from Grammy-winner and Grammy Hall of Fame inductee Bill Withers.

Scott-Heron&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Last Holiday&quot;, was published in January 2012. In her review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, professor of English and journalism Lynell George wrote:
&quot;The Last Holiday&quot; is as much about his life as it is about context, the theater of late 20th century America — from Jim Crow to the Reagan &#x27;80s and from Beale Street to 57th Street. The narrative is not, however, a rise-and-fall retelling of Scott-Heron&#x27;s life and career. It doesn&#x27;t connect all the dots. It moves off-the-beat, at its own speed ... This approach to revelation lends the book an episodic quality, like oral storytelling does. It winds around, it repeats itself.

===Scott-Heron&#x27;s estate===
At the time of Scott-Heron&#x27;s death, a will could not be found. Raquiyah Kelly-Heron filed papers in Manhattan&#x27;s New York Surrogate&#x27;s Court in August 2013, claiming that Rumal Rackley was not Scott-Heron&#x27;s son and should be omitted from the musician&#x27;s estate.
According to the &quot;Daily News&quot; website, Rackley, Kelly-Heron and two other sisters were seeking a resolution to the management of the estate. Rackley stated in court papers that Scott-Heron had asked him to be the administrator of the estate. 
Scott-Heron&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Spirits&quot; was dedicated to &quot;my son Rumal and my daughters Nia and Gia&quot;, and in court papers Rackley added that Scott-Heron &quot;introduced me [Rackley] from the stage as his son&quot;.

In 2011 Rackley had filed a suit against sister Gia Scott-Heron and her mother, Scott-Heron&#x27;s first wife, Brenda Sykes believing they had unfairly attained US$250,000 of Scott-Heron&#x27;s money. That case was settled for an undisclosed sum in early 2013 but the relationship between Rackley and Scott-Heron&#x27;s two adult daughters had already become strained in the months after Gil&#x27;s death. 
In her submission to the Surrogate Court, Kelly-Heron stated that a DNA test completed by Rackley in 2011—using DNA from Scott-Heron&#x27;s brother—revealed that they &quot;do not share a common male lineage&quot;, while Rackley has refused to undertake another DNA test. A hearing to address Kelly-Heron&#x27;s filing was scheduled for late August 2013, but by March 2016 further information on the matter was not publicly available. Rackley continued to serve as court-appointed administrator for the estate, and he donated material to the Smithsonian&#x27;s new National Museum of African American History and Culture to be displayed when the museum opened in September 2016.

The case was decided in December 2018 when the Surrogate Court ruled that Rumal Rackley and his half-sisters are all legal heirs, and in a ruling issued in May 2019 Rackley was granted Letters of Administration.

==Influence and legacy==
Scott-Heron&#x27;s work has influenced writers, academics and musicians, from indie rockers to rappers. His work during the 1970s influenced and helped engender subsequent African-American music genres, such as hip hop and neo soul. He has been described by music writers as &quot;the godfather of rap&quot; and &quot;the black Bob Dylan&quot;. Jamiroquai lead singer Jay Kay performed &quot;The Bottle&quot; with him at the Phoenix Festival in 1993 when his band was starting out, and Kay said in a 2022 interview that Scott-Heron had whispered to him: &quot;It&#x27;s your turn now.&quot; In the same interview, Kay called him a &quot;super influence for me&quot; and &quot;a master, a poet, and so much more&quot;. In a review for Jamiroquai&#x27;s &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot;, Entertainment Weekly writer Marisa Fox wrote: &quot;Gil Scott-Heron is still alive, but his ghost has already surfaced in the form of 22-year-old mad hatter Jay Kay and his trendy London acid-jazz group.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer Greg Kot comments on Scott-Heron&#x27;s collaborative work with Jackson:
Together they crafted jazz-influenced soul and funk that brought new depth and political consciousness to &#x27;70s music alongside Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. In classic albums such as &quot;Winter in America&quot; and &quot;From South Africa to South Carolina&quot;, Scott-Heron took the news of the day and transformed it into social commentary, wicked satire, and proto-rap anthems. He updated his dispatches from the front lines of the inner city on tour, improvising lyrics with an improvisational daring that matched the jazz-soul swirl of the music&quot;.

Of Scott-Heron&#x27;s influence on hip hop, Kot said he &quot;presag[ed] hip-hop and infus[ed] soul and jazz with poetry, humor and pointed political commentary&quot;. Ben Sisario of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;He [Scott-Heron] preferred to call himself a &quot;bluesologist&quot;, drawing on the traditions of blues, jazz and Harlem renaissance poetics&quot;. Tris McCall of &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; writes that &quot;The arrangements on Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s early recordings were consistent with the conventions of jazz poetry – the movement that sought to bring the spontaneity of live performance to the reading of verse&quot;. A music writer later noted that &quot;Scott-Heron&#x27;s unique proto-rap style influenced a generation of hip-hop artists&quot;, while &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;Scott-Heron&#x27;s work presaged not only conscious rap and poetry slams, but also acid jazz, particularly during his rewarding collaboration with composer-keyboardist-flutist Brian Jackson in the mid- and late &#x27;70s&quot;. &quot;The Observer&quot;″s Sean O&#x27;Hagan discussed the significance of Scott-Heron&#x27;s music with Brian Jackson, stating:
Together throughout the 1970s, Scott-Heron and Jackson made music that reflected the turbulence, uncertainty and increasing pessimism of the times, merging the soul and jazz traditions and drawing on an oral poetry tradition that reached back to the blues and forward to hip-hop. The music sounded by turns angry, defiant and regretful while Scott-Heron&#x27;s lyrics possessed a satirical edge that set them apart from the militant soul of contemporaries such as Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield.

Will Layman of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote about the significance of Scott-Heron&#x27;s early musical work:
In the early 1970s, Gil Scott-Heron popped onto the scene as a soul poet with jazz leanings; not just another Bill Withers, but a political voice with a poet&#x27;s skill. His spoken-voice work had punch and topicality. &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; and &quot;Johannesburg&quot; were calls to action: Stokely Carmichael if he&#x27;d had the groove of Ray Charles. &quot;The Bottle&quot; was a poignant story of the streets: Richard Wright as sung by a husky-voiced Marvin Gaye. To paraphrase Chuck D, Gil Scott-Heron&#x27;s music was a kind of CNN for black neighborhoods, prefiguring hip-hop by several years. It grew from the Last Poets, but it also had the funky swing of Horace Silver or Herbie Hancock—or Otis Redding. &quot;Pieces of a Man&quot; and &quot;Winter in America&quot; (collaborations with Brian Jackson) were classics beyond category&quot;.

Scott-Heron&#x27;s influence over hip hop is primarily exemplified by his definitive single &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;, sentiments from which have been explored by various rappers, including Aesop Rock, Talib Kweli and Common. In addition to his vocal style, Scott-Heron&#x27;s indirect contributions to rap music extend to his and co-producer Jackson&#x27;s compositions, which have been sampled by various hip-hop artists. &quot;We Almost Lost Detroit&quot; was sampled by Brand Nubian member Grand Puba (&quot;Keep On&quot;), Native Tongues duo Black Star (&quot;Brown Skin Lady&quot;), and MF Doom (&quot;Camphor&quot;). Additionally, Scott-Heron&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;A Legend in His Own Mind&quot; was sampled on Mos Def&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Nigga&quot;, the opening lyrics from his 1978 recording &quot;Angel Dust&quot; were appropriated by rapper RBX on the 1996 song &quot;Blunt Time&quot; by Dr. Dre, and CeCe Peniston&#x27;s 2000 song &quot;My Boo&quot; samples Scott-Heron&#x27;s 1974 recording &quot;The Bottle&quot;.

In addition to the Scott-Heron excerpt used in &quot;Who Will Survive in America&quot;, Kanye West sampled Scott-Heron and Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Home is Where the Hatred Is&quot; and &quot;We Almost Lost Detroit&quot; for the songs &quot;My Way Home&quot; and &quot;The People&quot;, respectively, both of which are collaborative efforts with Common. Scott-Heron, in turn, acknowledged West&#x27;s contributions, sampling the latter&#x27;s 2007 single &quot;Flashing Lights&quot; on his final album, 2010&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m New Here&quot;.

Scott-Heron admitted ambivalence regarding his association with rap, remarking in 2010 in an interview for the &quot;Daily Swarm&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I can take the blame for [rap music]&quot;. As &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Sisario explained, he preferred the moniker of &quot;bluesologist&quot;. Referring to reviews of his last album and references to him as the &quot;godfather of rap&quot;, Scott-Heron said: &quot;It&#x27;s something that&#x27;s aimed at the kids ... I have kids, so I listen to it. But I would not say it&#x27;s aimed at me. I listen to the jazz station.&quot; In 2013, Chattanooga rapper Isaiah Rashad recorded an unofficial mixtape called &quot;Pieces of a Kid&quot;, which was greatly influenced by Heron&#x27;s debut album &quot;Pieces of a Man&quot;.

Following Scott-Heron&#x27;s funeral in 2011, a tribute from publisher, record company owner, poet, and music producer Malik Al Nasir was published on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s website, titled &quot;Gil Scott-Heron saved my life&quot;.

In the 2018 film &quot;First Man&quot;, Scott-Heron is a minor character and is played by soul singer Leon Bridges.

He is one of eight significant people shown in mosaic at the 167th Street renovated subway station on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx that reopened in 2019.

<doc id="176480" wikidata="Q12397" url="?curid=176480" title="Metroid">
<text>is an action-adventure game franchise created by Nintendo. The player controls the bounty hunter Samus Aran, who protects the galaxy from Space Pirates and other malevolent forces and their attempts to harness the power of the parasitic Metroid creatures.

&quot;Metroid&quot; combines the platforming of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and the exploration of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; with a science fiction setting and an emphasis on nonlinear gameplay. Most &quot;Metroid&quot; games are side-scrolling, while the 3D games use a first-person perspective. Players battle hostile alien enemies and obtain power-ups as they progress through the game world. The series is known for its isolated atmosphere, featuring few non-player characters.

The first &quot;Metroid&quot; was developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and released on the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986. &quot;Metroid II: Return of Samus&quot; was released for the handheld Game Boy in 1991. &quot;Super Metroid&quot; (1994), released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, received acclaim. After a hiatus, &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; (2002) and &quot;&quot; (2004) were released for the Game Boy Advance. 

The first 3D &quot;Metroid&quot; game, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; (2002), was developed by Retro Studios for the GameCube and received acclaim. It was followed by &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot; (2004) and the Wii game &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot; (2007). &quot;&quot; (2010), developed by Team Ninja for the Wii, received weaker reviews. After another hiatus, MercurySteam developed a remake of &quot;Metroid II: Return of Samus&quot;, &quot;&quot; (2017) for the handheld Nintendo 3DS, followed by &quot;Metroid Dread&quot; (2021) for the Nintendo Switch. &quot;Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&quot; is scheduled for 2025.

As of September 2012, the &quot;Metroid&quot; series had sold over 17.44 million copies. It has been represented in other Nintendo media, including the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Additional media includes soundtracks, comic books, and manga. Along with the 1997 Konami game &quot;&quot;, the early &quot;Metroid&quot; games defined the Metroidvania subgenre, inspiring other games with continuous, explorable side-scrolling levels. Samus was one of the first prominent female video game characters.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Metroid&quot; series contains gameplay elements from shooter, platformer, adventure, survival and sometimes first person games. The series is notable for its non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran, with few or no other characters to interact with. The player gains items and power-ups for Samus&#x27;s cybernetic suit primarily through exploration, and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with the suit&#x27;s arm cannon. Many such upgrades enable further avenues of exploration. A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs.

The classic series consists of 2D side-scrollers, while the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; series uses a first-person perspective, and first-person shooter mechanics. The 2010 &quot;Other M&quot; made use of a third person shooter format.

The original &quot;Metroid&quot; was influenced by two other major Nintendo franchises: &quot;Mario&quot;, from which it borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping, and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, from which it borrowed non-linear exploration. &quot;Metroid&quot; differed in its atmosphere of solitude and foreboding. &quot;Metroid&quot; was also one of the first video games to feature an exploration to the left as well as the right, and backtracking to already explored areas to search for secret items and paths. Since the late 1990s, the term &quot;Metroidvania&quot; has been applied to this format.

===Audio===
The &quot;Metroid&quot; series has been noted and praised for its unique style of video game music. Hirokazu &quot;Hip&quot; Tanaka, composer of the original &quot;Metroid&quot;, has said he wanted to make a score that made players feel like they were encountering a &quot;living creature&quot; and had no distinction between music and sound effects. The only time the main &quot;Metroid&quot; theme was heard was after Mother Brain is defeated; this is intended to give the player a catharsis. At all other times, no melodies are present in the game. The composer of &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, Kenji Yamamoto, came up with some themes by humming to himself while riding his motorcycle to work. He was asked to compose the music for &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; to reinforce the series continuity. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;″s Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound was mixed by a member of Dolby.

Developers from Retro Studios noted how the 6 MB memory budget for all sound effects of a level in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was crucial in producing a quality soundtrack, as each sound had to be of high quality to be included. Yamamoto used heavy drums, piano, voiced chants, clangs of pipes, and electric guitar. &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot; took advantage of the increased RAM in the Wii, allowing for higher-quality audio samples. Kenji Yamamoto, who composed the music for &quot;Super Metroid&quot; and the &quot;Prime&quot; trilogy, copied the musical design of the original &quot;Metroid&quot; in &quot;Metroid Prime 3&quot;, by keeping the music and themes dark and scary until the very end, when uplifting music is played during the credits.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The &quot;Metroid&quot; franchise takes place in a science fiction setting where humanity is shown to be a part of a spacefaring sovereignty known as the Galactic Federation. Other races are both a part of the Federation as well as close allies, the most prolific being the Chozo, an avian species possessing advanced technology and skills in bioengineering. The mutual nemesis of the Federation and the Chozo are the Space Pirates, a villainous interstellar cabal comprising multiple alien races of disreputable nature that all refuse to abide to the Galactic Federation&#x27;s rule. They are led by the dragon-like warlord Ridley, and plot to develop weapons of mass destruction from hazardous life forms and materials to destroy the Federation and secure galactic dominance.

The eponymous Metroids are a species of predatory, jellyfish-like organisms that feed on an undetectable life energy found in all living creatures. Biological weapons, the Metroids were engineered by the Chozo to eradicate a parasitic, shapeshifting virus known as the &quot;X&quot; that threatened their civilization. While the Metroids succeeded in stopping the X, they became a danger to the Chozo themselves when they developed the ability to evolve into different and far deadlier forms. Most of the games center around the efforts of various organizations, including the Space Pirates, the Galactic Federation, and rogue members of the Chozo race, to weaponize the Metroids and the subsequent conflicts they cause.

===Story===
&quot;Metroid&quot; follows the adventures of the bounty hunter Samus Aran, who battles the Space Pirates and the Metroids. Samus was raised by the Chozo after her parents were killed by a Space Pirate raid led by Ridley. She serves in the military of the Galactic Federation before departing and beginning work as a bounty hunter, while facing the forces of Ridley and Mother Brain.

In the original &quot;Metroid&quot;, Samus travels to the planet Zebes to stop the Space Pirates from using the Metroids to create biological weapons. She defeats the cybernetic lifeform Mother Brain, as well as Ridley and his fellow Space Pirate leader, Kraid.

The &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; series is set between &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Metroid II: Return of Samus&quot;, and chronicles Samus&#x27; conflicts with a malignant, radioactive substance named Phazon. In &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, Samus travels to Tallon IV to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a Phazon-infused meteor that has poisoned the local ecosystem. After battling a cybernetically enhanced Ridley and clearing out the Space Pirate presence on the planet, Samus purges the Phazon from Tallon IV by defeating the titular enemy, a Phazon-infected Metroid. &quot;Metroid Prime: Hunters&quot;, which is unconnected to the Phazon storyline, sees Samus respond to a distress call to the Alimbic Cluster. Other bounty hunters respond to the call, and after conflicting amongst themselves, they all ultimately band together to fight against a creature named Gorea. In &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot;, Samus explores the planet Aether, which is suffering from a Phazon outbreak. The Phazon has split the world into &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot; dimensions, leading to the rise of the evil Ing race. While liberating Aether from the Ing, Samus encounters Dark Samus, a revitalized Metroid Prime that has partially copied her physical appearance. In &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot;, Samus and three other bounty hunters are recruited by the Federation to stop Dark Samus from infecting the galaxy with Phazon. While fighting to avoid being slowly corrupted by Phazon herself, Samus eradicates Phazon and her double. &quot;Metroid Prime: Federation Force&quot;, the only game in which players do not control Samus, sees Samus mind-controlled by Space Pirates; the Federation Force, an elite squadron of marines equipped with powerful exosuits, battles to rescue her and destroy the Space Pirates.

In &quot;Metroid II&quot;, the Galactic Federation calls for the extermination of the Metroid species and contracts Samus to travel to the species&#x27; homeworld, SR388, to carry out their extinction. She succeeds in wiping out the planet&#x27;s Metroid population, but saves a single hatchling Metroid that bonds to her and delivers it to the Ceres research station for study. In &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, Ridley steals the hatchling and takes it to Zebes, where the Space Pirates are attempting to clone the Metroids. After killing Ridley, Samus herself is nearly killed by the revived Mother Brain, but is rescued by the now grown Metroid which sacrifices itself. Samus destroys Mother Brain in retaliation and escapes as Zebes explodes, exterminating her old enemies for good.

In &quot;Metroid: Other M&quot;, set after &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, Samus investigates the Bottle Ship, a derelict scientific research station, with a Galactic Federation platoon led by her former commanding officer, Adam Malkovich. They team up against many bioweapons created by a Federation science group, including clones of creatures Samus faced on Zebes like Ridley and the Metroids. A revived Mother Brain, now occupying a humanoid body supplied to her by the Federation, takes control of the Metroids and attempts to unleash them upon the Federation, but is stopped by Samus at the cost of Adam&#x27;s life. Afterward, Samus encounters and kills the ethereal entity Phantoon and sets the Bottle Ship to self-destruct. In &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, Samus accompanies a team of scientists to SR388, where she has her first encounter with the X parasites when the species reappears in the absence of the Metroids. The X overruns a scientific research station in the planet&#x27;s orbit, assimilating and imitating many creatures being studied on board. Samus is infected by one but is saved using a vaccine made from the baby Metroid&#x27;s cells. She discovers that the Federation has been cloning Metroids in secret, and sets the space station on a collision with SR388 to destroy the X parasites. &quot;Metroid Dread&quot; continues where &quot;Fusion&quot; left off, with the Federation dispatching a squadron of advanced automatons known as E.M.M.I. to investigate the planet ZDR, where X parasites have been sighted. Samus is sent to the planet herself after contact is lost, coming into conflict with the X and a Chozo war criminal named Raven Beak, stopping both from invading the rest of the galaxy.

== Development and history ==
=== 1986–1991: Conception and first game ===
The central figures in the production and development of the &quot;Metroid&quot; series are Satoru Okada, who directed &quot;Metroid&quot; and created the series; Yoshio Sakamoto, who was a character designer for the first game and has directed or supervised most of the sequels; Gunpei Yokoi, who headed the R&amp;D1 division and produced the first two games; Makoto Kano, who wrote the scenario for &quot;Metroid&quot;, co-designed the second game, and produced the third; and Hiroji Kiyotake, who designed characters for the original.

The original &quot;Metroid&quot;, an action game for the Family Computer Disk System, was developed by Nintendo&#x27;s Research &amp; Development 1 (R&amp;D1) and released in Japan on August 6, 1986. It was published for the Nintendo Entertainment System in August 1987 in North America and on January 15, 1988, in Europe. It was directed by Satoru Okada.

&quot;Metroid&quot; was designed to be a shooting game that combined the platform jumping of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; with the non-linear exploration of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and a darker aesthetic. The name of the game is a portmanteau of the words &quot;metro&quot; (as in rapid transit) and android, and was meant to allude to the mainly underground setting of the first game as well as its robot-like protagonist. Halfway through development of the original &quot;Metroid&quot;, one of the staff said to his fellow developers &quot;Hey, wouldn&#x27;t that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?&quot;, and the idea was accepted. Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 science-fiction horror film &quot;Alien&quot; was described by Sakamoto as a &quot;huge influence&quot; after the world of the first &quot;Metroid&quot; had been created. In recognition of this, an antagonist was given the name Ridley, after director Ridley Scott. The development staff were also influenced by the work of the film&#x27;s creature designer H. R. Giger, finding his style to be fitting for the &quot;Metroid&quot; universe.

=== 1991–2002: Sequels and first hiatus ===
&quot;Metroid II: Return of Samus&quot; was released for the Game Boy in 1991 in North America and in 1992 in Japan and Europe. &quot;Metroid II&quot; also further established Samus&#x27; visual design, with the bulky Varia Suit upgrade and different arm cannons.

As R&amp;D1 were committed to making another game, Nintendo brought in Intelligent Systems to develop &quot;Super Metroid&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). Development began in late 1991. Released in 1994, &quot;Super Metroid&quot; drastically expanded the &quot;Metroid&quot; formula, with numerous new power-ups and a richer story. It received acclaim and is considered one of the best SNES games. It was directed by Yoshio Sakamoto, character designer for the first &quot;Metroid&quot;; Sakamoto has directed or produced most of the 2D &quot;Metroid&quot; games since.

After &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, Nintendo released no new &quot;Metroid&quot; games for eight years. They considered developing a &quot;Metroid&quot; game for its next console, the Nintendo 64, but could not generate firm ideas. Sakamoto said he could not imagine how the Nintendo 64 controller could be used to move Samus. An unidentified company declined an offer from Nintendo to develop a &quot;Metroid&quot; game for the Nintendo 64, as they were not confident they could create a worthwhile successor to &quot;Super Metroid&quot;. Samus appeared in the Nintendo 64 fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; (1999).

=== 2002–2009: &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; and Game Boy Advance games ===
In 2000, the Nintendo producer Shigeru Miyamoto visited the new Nintendo subsidiary Retro Studios in Austin, Texas. He did not like any of the projects they had in development, but spent time playing &quot;Action Adventure&quot;, a third-person science-fiction action game with a female protagonist. Miyamoto tasked Retro with developing a &quot;Metroid&quot; game for the new Nintendo console, the GameCube. The team terminated &quot;Action Adventure&quot; and moved to &quot;Metroid&quot;. 

&quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, the first 3D &quot;Metroid&quot; game, released in 2002, moved the nonlinear structure of &quot;Super Metroid&quot; to a first-person perspective. Nintendo stressed that it was not a first-person shooter but a &quot;first-person adventure&quot;. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; received acclaim. It sold 2.84 million copies worldwide and was the best-selling &quot;Metroid&quot; game until &quot;Metroid Dread&quot; (2021).

In 2002, Nintendo released &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, a 2D game for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). It was developed by R&amp;D1 and written and directed by Sakamoto. Its gameplay is similar to &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, but with a more mission-based structure that gives more guidance to the player. The team&#x27;s next GBA project was &quot;&quot; (2004), a remake of the original &quot;Metroid&quot;. Both GBA games received acclaim. A Nintendo restructure merged R&amp;D1 with R&amp;D2 in 2003, shortly ahead of the release of &quot;Zero Mission&quot;. A 2D &quot;Metroid&quot; game for the Nintendo DS, &quot;Metroid Dread&quot;, was in development around 2006, but the hardware was not suitable for the project. &quot;Dread&quot; was ultimately revived in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch.

In 2004, Nintendo also released &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot;, which sees Samus switching between parallel light and dark worlds and introduced more difficulty. &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot;, released for the Wii in 2007, added motion controls and has Samus exploring separate planets, with more emphasis on shooting action. The &quot;Prime&quot; games were rereleased for the Wii in the compilation &quot;Metroid Prime: Trilogy&quot;.

In 2005, Nintendo released &quot;Metroid Prime Pinball&quot;, a pinball spin-off for the DS developed by Fuse Games. &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot;, a multiplayer game developed by Nintendo Software Technology, was released for the DS in 2006.

=== 2010–2016: &quot;Other M&quot; and second hiatus ===
A new 3D &quot;Metroid&quot; game, &quot;&quot;, developed with the Japanese studio Team Ninja and directed by Sakamoto, was released for Wii in 2010. It featured a third-person perspective and placed a greater focus on story and action. &quot;Other M&quot; received weaker reviews, with criticism for its characterization of Samus as timid and emotional and its reduced emphasis on exploration. &quot;Polygon&quot; described &quot;Other M&quot; as &quot;such a massive misfire and a flop with fans that it practically killed the series&quot;, with the series going on another hiatus for six years.

A &quot;Metroid&quot; minigame, &quot;Metroid Blast&quot;, appeared in the Wii U game &quot;Nintendo Land&quot; (2012), which had a mixed reception. Using the Wii U GamePad, the player controls Samus&#x27;s gunship, while up to four players with Wii Remotes and Nunchuks control Mii characters on foot, wearing Varia Suits. Miyamoto said this reflected his ideas for future &quot;Metroid&quot; games.

In 2014, a former artist from Next Level Games said that Next Level had built a &quot;Metroid&quot; prototype for the Nintendo 3DS handheld before Nintendo asked them to develop &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot; instead. In 2016, Nintendo released &quot;Metroid Prime: Federation Force&quot;, a multiplayer game for the 3DS developed by Next Level. It received criticism for its multiplayer focus and frivolous tone.

=== 2017–present: &quot;Samus Returns&quot;, &quot;Dread&quot; and &quot;Prime 4: Beyond&quot; ===
A remake of &quot;Metroid II&quot;, &quot;&quot;, was developed by MercurySteam and released for the 3DS in September 2017. It retained the gameplay of the original and added 3D graphics and gameplay features such as melee combat. MercurySteam&#x27;s next project was &quot;Metroid Dread&quot; for the Nintendo Switch, a realization of the cancelled Nintendo DS project from the late 2000s. Released in October 2021, it had sold more than 2.9 million copies worldwide by May 2022, making it the best-selling &quot;Metroid&quot; game. 

In February 2023, Nintendo released &quot;Metroid Prime Remastered&quot;, a high-definition remaster of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; for the Switch. It was developed by Retro Studios with assistance from developers including Iron Galaxy Studios.

In June 2017, at E3, Nintendo announced &quot;Metroid Prime 4&quot; for the Switch. While not confirmed by Nintendo, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; reported that &quot;Prime 4&quot; was being developed by Bandai Namco Studios. Unsatisfied with the progress, Nintendo announced in January 2019 that it had restarted the development under Retro Studios, the developer of the previous &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; games. In June 2024, Nintendo revealed a trailer and the title &quot;Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&quot;, with a release year of 2025.

==Reception==
&quot;Metroid&quot; ranked the 70th top game (collectively) by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 1996 and the 6th in 1999, and as the eighth best game franchise by &quot;IGN&quot; in 2008. In 2001, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named &quot;Super Metroid&quot; the best game ever. All the &quot;Metroid&quot; games released by 2005 were included in a &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; top 200 Nintendo games list, &quot;Prime&quot; in the &quot;IGN&quot; top 100, &quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, &quot;Prime&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot; in a list by GameFAQs users; &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Super Metroid&quot; in &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s list; and &quot;Prime&quot; and &quot;Super Metroid&quot; in &quot;Edge&quot;″s list. The series has influenced games including &quot;&quot;.

Samus Aran was recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as &quot;enduringly popular&quot; and as the &quot;first playable human female character in a mainstream video game&quot;, although Toby Masuyo (&quot;Kissy&quot;) from Namco&#x27;s &quot;Alien Sector&quot; predates her by one year. Ridley was the second-most requested Nintendo character by &quot;IGN&quot; and number one by the fans to be added as a playable character to the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series and Mother Brain is often named among the best video game bosses.

The original &quot;Metroid&quot; has been described as boosted by its &quot;eerie&quot; music, adding a &quot;sense of mystery and exploration&quot; to the game by making the game &quot;moody and atmospheric&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the well-timed music that helped add suspense. &quot;GameSpot&quot; described &quot;Super Metroid&quot; as better than the original &quot;in literally every conceivable way&quot;, &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; was noted for its &quot;understated score&quot; which fit the mood of the adventure and its excellent stereo sound effects, making it an uncommonly good Game Boy Advance sound experience. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; was considered one of the best games ever made upon its release, winning Game of the Year from various publications and websites. &quot;IGN&quot; called the aural experience with &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot; &quot;mesmerizing&quot;. Music from &quot;Metroid&quot; has been frequently re-released as part of &quot;best of&quot; video game music releases. &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;″s soundtrack was called the best sound design on the GameCube. The sound effects were also noted for a high degree of accuracy and blending with the soundtrack. On the popular video game music site OverClocked ReMix, &quot;Super Metroid&quot; is the tenth-most remixed video game, while the first &quot;Metroid&quot; video game was twenty-fifth.

===Sales===
Each &quot;Metroid&quot; game, excluding spin-offs and remakes, has sold more than one million copies. By September 2012, the series had sold over 17.44 million copies worldwide. &quot;Metroid&quot; sales in Japan have typically been lower than in the United States. In its debut week in Japan, &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot; sold 32,388 units, ranking it behind &quot;Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan!&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, &quot;Wii Fit&quot;, and &quot;Gundam Musou Special&quot;. &quot;Metroid: Other M&quot; was the third-bestselling video game in Japan during its week of release with 45,398 copies sold, ranking it behind &quot;Wii Party&quot; and &quot;Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airu Village&quot;. It sold an additional 11,239 copies the following week.

==Legacy==
Along with the 1997 Konami game &quot;&quot;, the early &quot;Metroid&quot; games defined a subgenre known as Metroidvania. Tom Happ, developer of the 2015 Metroidvania game &quot;Axiom Verge&quot;, defined Metroidvania games as side-scrolling adventures with continuous maps, rather than discrete levels, that require the player to collect items and backtrack. Other notable Metroidvania games include &quot;Cave Story&quot; (2004), &quot;Shadow Complex&quot; (2009), &quot;Ori and the Blind Forest&quot; (2014), &quot;Hollow Knight&quot; (2017), and &quot;Chasm&quot; (2018). &quot;Metroid&quot; is therefore among a handful of game series to have genres named after them, along with &quot;Dark Souls&quot; (Soulslike) and &quot;Rogue&quot; (Roguelike).

In 2016, &quot;AM2R&quot;, a fan-made remake of &quot;Metroid II&quot; was released. Nintendo issued takedown notices to halt its distribution, citing the potential damage to its intellectual property. &quot;AM2R&quot; was nominated for the Game Awards 2016, but was removed as it had not been cleared by Nintendo for inclusion.

===Crossovers===
====&quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; franchise====

Samus is a playable character in all five &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; games. Games from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; onward also feature Zero Suit Samus, a version of the heroine using the blue form-fitting suit seen in &quot;Zero Mission&quot; and the &quot;Prime&quot; series. Ridley makes cameos in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, where he can be seen flying through the level Zebes, and in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; both as an unlockable trophy and in the game&#x27;s opening, where he is fighting Samus at Ceres Space Station. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, Ridley appears as a boss character in both normal and Meta Ridley forms. Ridley&#x27;s clone from &quot;&quot; appears as a boss on the Pyroshpere stage in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot;, where he will join a fighter&#x27;s side if they manage to knock him out. Due to demand from fans, Ridley was made a playable fighter in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. Kraid also appeared in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; as a stage hazard in Brinstar Depths and unlockable trophy. Various other characters such as Metroids, Mother Brain and Dark Samus appear as either trophies or stickers in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series as well. Dark Samus would later debut as a fighter in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, sharing a moveset similar to Samus. A number of locations from the &quot;Metroid&quot; franchise have appeared in &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; games as battle stages.

====Other games====
Samus has appeared in other Nintendo games such as &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;, the NES version of &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;Tetris DS&quot;, &quot;Galactic Pinball&quot;, &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot;, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land 3&quot; and &quot;WarioWare&quot;.

A Metroid-lookalike enemy, called the Komayto, appears in &quot;Kid Icarus&quot; for the NES; the characters allude to the similarities between the two in &quot;Kid Icarus: Uprising&quot;. In &quot;Dead or Alive: Dimensions&quot;, a fighting game developed by Team Ninja for the 3DS, one stage is a replica of the arena in which Samus fights Ridley in &quot;Metroid: Other M&quot; and features both as non-playable characters. When asked why Samus is not playable in &quot;Dimensions&quot;, Team Ninja&#x27;s Yosuke Hayashi said in an interview that &quot;it would be better to let her focus on her job rather than kicking everyone&#x27;s butt in [&quot;Dead or Alive: Dimensions&quot;]&quot;. The Wii U launch game &quot;Nintendo Land&quot; has a minigame based on the series called &quot;Metroid Blast&quot;. A Samus amiibo figure can be used to unlock a Mii costume based on her appearance in &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; and a Samus costume in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;.

In 2020, Nintendo and Epic Games began negotiations to include Samus in &quot;Fortnite&quot; as a skin. The plans came to light when internal Epic documents were released as part of the &quot;Epic Games v. Apple&quot; case in 2021. Other characters from the batch in the document such as Kratos and Master Chief were added to the game in late 2020, but Samus was not. In 2024, former Epic creative director Donald Mustard revealed that Nintendo had requested Nintendo Switch exclusivity for the Samus skin, which was against Epic&#x27;s policy of maintaining feature parity for &quot;Fortnite&quot; across all platforms, and so the character was never included.

===In other media===

====Television====
A &quot;Metroid&quot; animated series was considered for the &quot;Super Mario Bros. Power Hour&quot;, a cancelled animation block that would have aired in the 1980s. Concept art was produced for the series, which notably featured a male incarnation of Samus. &quot;Power Hour&quot; never moved forward in the intended format, instead being replaced by &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot; which aired in 1989. Mother Brain was the primary villain in the &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; TV show.

====Manga====
Various magazines have published comics and manga based on &quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot;, and &quot;&quot; in both the United States and Japan. Samus Aran and other &quot;Metroid&quot; characters also featured in the &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; comic books by Valiant Comics. In Japan, a &quot;Metroid&quot; manga series was published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Magazine Z&quot; beginning in November 2003, and ran for 16 chapters which were later collected into two Tankōbon volumes. The series chronicled Samus&#x27; life up through the events of the original game, and went on to influence the plots of subsequent games in the franchise. Also in Japan, &quot;Comic Bom Bom&quot; published a three-volume manga starring Samus, 

====Proposed film====
In 2003, two producers optioned the rights to create a live-action film based on &quot;Metroid&quot;, but the rights expired. The director John Woo acquired the rights a few years later, and his studio Lion Rock Productions was to produce and release the film before 2006. The writers included David Greenwalt, who had worked on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;Grimm&quot;. Producer Brad Froxhoven stated that the film would have explored Samus&#x27; origin story, describing her as an &quot;exceptionally talented&quot;, but a &quot;flawed&quot; character seeking redemption, and that the film would have been faithful to the original games.

According to Foxhoven, Nintendo was protective due to the failure of the 1993 &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; film. Nintendo had no answers to the team&#x27;s questions about Samus&#x27; personal life, relationships, and other personal characteristics, and was uncomfortable with the film team &quot;being the ones to propose those answers&quot;. Foxhoven said Nintendo left the discussions appreciating that they needed to develop the franchise further if it were to become a Hollywood film. In 2013, Sakamoto said he could support a film directed by Ryuji Kitaura, the director of the CG scenes in &quot;Other M&quot;, if the concept and methodologies were good enough.

<text>Byblos ( ; ), also known as Jebeil, Jbeil or Jubayl (, ), is an ancient city in the Keserwan-Jbeil Governorate of Lebanon. The area is believed to have been first settled between 8800 and 7000BC and continuously inhabited since 5000BC. During its history, Byblos was part of numerous cultures including Egyptian, Phoenician, Assyrian, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Genoese, Mamluk and Ottoman. Urbanisation is thought to have begun during the third millennium BC and it developed into a city making it one of the oldest cities in the world, if not the oldest. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

It was in Ancient Byblos that the Phoenician alphabet, likely the ancestor of the Greek, Latin and all other Western alphabets, was developed.

== Etymology ==


The name appears as &quot;Kebny&quot; in Egyptian hieroglyphic records going back to the 4th-dynasty pharaoh Sneferu (BC) and as () in the Akkadian cuneiform Amarna letters to the 18th-dynasty pharaohs and IV. In the 1stmillenniumBC, its name appeared in Phoenician and Punic inscriptions as (, ); in the Hebrew Bible as &quot;Geval&quot; (); and in Syriac as (). Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Onomasticon&quot; stated that Byblos was called &quot;Gobel / Gebal&quot; in Hebrew. The name seems to derive from (, &quot;well&quot;) and (, &quot;god&quot;), the latter a word that could variously refer to any of the Canaanite gods or to their leader in particular. The name thus seems to have meant the &quot;Well of the God&quot; or &quot;Source of the God&quot;.

Its present Arabic name () or &quot;J&quot;(&quot;e&quot;)&quot;beil&quot; is a direct descendant of these earlier names, although apparently modified by a misunderstanding of the name as the triliteral root or , meaning &quot;mountain&quot;. All of these, along with Byblos, are etymologically related. During the Crusades, this name appeared in Western records as &quot;Gibelet&quot; or . This name was used for Byblos Castle and its associated lordship.

The Phoenician City, known to the Greeks as () and to the Romans as , was important for their import of papyrus out of Ancient Egypt – to the extent that &quot;Byblos&quot; came to mean &quot;papyrus&quot; in Greek. The English word &quot;Bible&quot;, therefore, ultimately derives from the Greek name of the city, &quot;Βύβλος&quot; (&#x27;Βύblos / Byblos&#x27;)&quot;,&quot; a Greek mumbo-jumble of גְּבָל (&#x27;Gāḇal / Gəbal Gobâl&#x27;..., that is, &#x27;Gebal&#x27; or &#x27;Jebel&#x27;), which shares the same root as גְּבוּל (&#x27;Gəḇūl / Gābūl, that is &#x27;Gebul&#x27; or &#x27;Jabul&#x27;), as they&#x27;re derivatives of ג־ב־ל (&#x27;g-ḇ-l&#x27; / &#x27;g-b-l&#x27; / &#x27;g-v-l&#x27;), which means &#x27;twist as a rope&#x27;, &#x27;(be a, set) border&#x27; or &#x27;bound(aria)&#x27;, which tells us that it is a North Boundary of Canaan.

==History and archaeology==

Situated approximately 42 km (26 mi) north of Beirut, Byblos holds a strong allure for archaeologists due to its accumulations of various strata resulting from countless centuries of human dwelling. The initial excavation was conducted by Ernest Renan in 1860, documented in his work &quot;&quot;Mission de Phénicie&quot; (1865–1874)&quot;. This was succeeded by Pierre Montet&#x27;s efforts from 1921 to 1924, and later by Maurice Dunand, who continued excavations from 1925 for a span of forty years. Renan&#x27;s expedition was to &quot;provide the evidence that the city did not move and that Gebeil is Byblos&quot;.

Fragments attributed to the semi-legendary pre-Homeric Phoenician priest Sanchuniathon say Byblos was the first city erected in Phoenicia and was established by the god Cronus. (Cronus was considered the nearest equivalent to the Canaanite Baal / Baal Hammon in the syncretising system used by the ancient Greeks and Romans.) According to the writer Philo of Byblos (quoting Sanchuniathon, and quoted in Eusebius), Byblos was founded by the Phoenician shrine god El (whom the Greeks identified with their god Cronus). During the 3rd millennium BC, the first signs of a town can be observed, with the remains of well-built houses of uniform size. This was the period when the Canaanite civilization began to develop.

===Neolithic and Chalcolithic levels===
Neolithic remains of some buildings can be observed at the site. Jacques Cauvin published studies of flint tools from the stratified Neolithic and Chalcolithic sites in 1962. Remains of humans found in Chalcolithic burials have been published by Henri Victor Vallois in 1937. Tombs from this era were discussed by Emir Maurice Chehab in 1950. Early pottery found at the tell was published by E.S. Boynton in 1960 with further studies by R. Erich in 1954 and Van Liere and Henri de Contenson in 1964.

====Dunand&#x27;s five-level stratigraphy====
Prehistoric settlements at Byblos were divided up by Dunand into the following five periods, which were recently expanded and re-calibrated by Yosef Garfinkel to correlate with Tell es-Sultan (Jericho):

* Early Neolithic (early phase) corresponding to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) of Jericho, represented by plastered floors and naviforme technology, dated between 8800 and 7000 BC;
* Early Neolithic (late phase) corresponding to the PNA of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) IX (also Yarmukian) between 6400 and 5800 BC, represented by pottery, sickle blades, figurines and small points;
* Middle Neolithic corresponding to the PNB of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) VIII and represented by pottery, dated between 5800 and 5300 BC;
* Late Neolithic corresponding to the Middle Chalcolithic of Beth Shean and represented by pottery, stone vessels, silos, chamber tombs and seals, dated between 5300 and 4500 BC;
* Early Chalcolithic corresponding to the Late Chalcolithic of Ghassulian, represented by jar burials, pierced flint, churn and a violin figurine, dated to between 4500 and 3600 BC and,
* Late Chalcolithic corresponding to the Early Bronze Age, represented by architecture and cylinder seal impressions, dated to between 3600 and 3100 BC.

The site first appears to have been settled during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period, approximately 8800 to 7000 BC (Durand&#x27;s Early Neolithic).

Early Neolithic Byblos was a later settlement than others in the Beqaa Valley such as Labweh and Ard Tlaili. It was located on the seaward slope of the larger of the two hills that used to compose ancient Byblos, with a watered valley in between.

The original site spread down into the valley and covered an area of providing fertile soils and a protected landing place for boats. Dunand discovered around twenty houses although some of the settlement was suggested to have been lost to the sea, robbed or destroyed. Dwellings were rectangular with plastered floors, pottery was usually Dark faced burnished ware with some shell impressions.

The Middle Neolithic was a smaller settlement of no more than adjacent to the older site. The pottery was more developed with red washes and more varied forms and elaborate decorations, buildings were poorer with unplastered floors.

The Late Neolithic period showed development from the middle in building design, a wider range of more developed flint tools and a far larger variety of pottery with fabrication including silica. The Late Chalcolithic featured developments of &quot;Canaanite blades&quot; and fan scrapers. Adult burials in jars started to appear along with metal in the form of one copper hook, found in a jar. Some jars were lined with white plaster that was applied and self-hardened after firing. Copper appeared more frequently in the Late Chalcolithic period along with multiple burials in tombs and jar handles with impressed signs.
=== Early Bronze ===
According to Lorenzo Nigro, Byblos moved from being a fishermen&#x27;s village to its earlier urban form at the beginning of the third millennium BC. Early Bronze Age remains were characterised by the development of Byblos combed ware and a lithic assemblage studied by Jacques Cauvin.

Watson Mills and Roger Bullard suggest that during the Old Kingdom of Egypt and Middle Kingdom of Egypt Byblos was virtually an Egyptian colony. The growing city was a wealthy one and seems to have been an ally (among &quot;those who are on his waters&quot;) of Egypt for many centuries. First Dynasty tombs used timbers from Byblos. One of the oldest Egyptian words for an oceangoing boat was &quot;Byblos ship&quot;. Archaeologists have recovered Egyptian-made artifacts as old as a vessel fragment bearing the name of the Second dynasty ruler Khasekhemwy, although this &quot;may easily have reached Byblos through trade and/or at a later period&quot;.

=== Middle Bronze ===
Objects have been found at Byblos naming the 12th Dynasty king Senusret II, the 13th Dynasty Egyptian king Neferhotep I.

=== Late Bronze ===
The rulers of Byblos maintained close relationships with the New Kingdom pharaohs of Ancient Egypt

Around 1350 BC, the Amarna letters include 60 letters from Rib-Hadda and his successor Ili-Rapih who were rulers of Byblos, writing to the Egyptian government. This is mainly due to Rib-Hadda&#x27;s constant pleas for military assistance from Akhenaten. They also deal with the conquest of neighbouring city-states by the Habiru.

It appears Egyptian contact peaked during the 19th dynasty, only to decline during the 20th and 21st dynasties. In addition, when the New Kingdom collapsed in the 11th century BC, Byblos ceased being a colony and became the foremost city of Phoenicia. Although the archaeological evidence seems to indicate a brief resurgence during the 22nd and 23rd dynasties, it is clear after the Third Intermediate Period the Egyptians started favouring Tyre and Sidon instead of Byblos.

Archaeological evidence at Byblos, particularly the five Byblian royal inscriptions dating back to around 1200–1000 BC, shows existence of a Phoenician alphabet of twenty-two characters; an important example is the Ahiram sarcophagus. The use of the alphabet was spread by Phoenician merchants through their maritime trade into parts of North Africa and Europe. One of the most important monuments of this period is the Temple of the Obelisks, dedicated to the Canaanite war god Resheph, but this had fallen into ruins by the time of Alexander the Great.

=== Iron Age ===

In the Assyrian period, Sibittibaal of Byblos became tributary to Tiglath-Pileser III in 738 BC, and in 701 BC, when Sennacherib conquered all Phoenicia, the king of Byblos was Urumilki. Byblos was also subject to Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (r. 681–669 BC) and Ashurbanipal (r. 668–627 BC), under its kings Milkiasaph and Yehawmelek.

In the Achaemenid Empire (538–332 BC), Byblos was the fourth of four Phoenician vassal kingdoms established by the Persians; the first three being Sidon, Tyr, and Arwad.

=== Classical antiquity ===
Hellenistic rule came with the arrival of Alexander the Great in the area in 332 BC. Coinage was in use, and there is abundant evidence of continued trade with other Mediterranean countries.

During the Greco-Roman period, the temple of Resheph was elaborately rebuilt, and the city, though smaller than its neighbours such as Tyrus and Zidonia, was a centre for the cult of Adonis.

King Herod of Judaea, known for his extensive building projects, including beyond his own kingdom, constructed a city wall for Byblos.

In the 3rd century, a small but impressive theatre was constructed. With the rise of Christianity, a bishopric was established in Byblos, and the town grew rapidly. Although a Sasanian colony is known to have been established in the region following the early Muslim conquests of 636, there is little archaeological evidence for it. Trade with Europe effectively dried up, and it was not until the coming of the First Crusade in 1098 that prosperity returned to Byblos, known then as Gibelet or Giblet.

=== Crusader, Mamluk, Ottoman period ===

In the 12th and 13th century, Byblos became part of the County of Tripoli, a Crusader state connected to, but largely independent from, the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem.

As Gibelet or Giblet, it came under the rule of the Genoese Embriaco family, who created for themselves the Lordship of Gibelet, first as administrators of the city in the name of the Republic of Genoa, and then as a hereditary fief, undertaking to pay an annual fee to Genoa and the church of San Lorenzo (Genoa&#x27;s Cathedral).

The Embriaco family&#x27;s residence, the Byblos Castle, along with the fortified town, served as an important military base for the Crusaders. The remains of the castle are among the most impressive architectural structures now visible in the town centre. The town was taken by Saladin in 1187, re-taken by the Crusaders, and conquered by Baibars in 1266, but it remained in the possession of the Embriacos until around 1300.

Having voluntarily surrendered to the Mamluks, the city was relatively spared from looting following its capture. Its fortifications were subsequently restored by Baybars. From 1516 until 1918, the town and the whole region became part of the Ottoman Empire.

=== Contemporary history ===
Byblos and all of Lebanon were placed under French Mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence. The 2006 Lebanon War negatively affected the ancient city by covering its harbour and town walls with an oil slick that was the result of an oil spill from a nearby power plant.

During the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave Byblos and 33 other cultural sites enhanced protection to safeguard them against damage.

==Demographics==
Byblos&#x27;s inhabitants are predominantly Christian, mostly Maronite, with minorities of Armenian Apostolic, Greek Orthodox, and Greek Catholics. There is also a minority of Shi`i Muslims. It is said that the city of Bint Jbeil (&quot;Daughter of Byblos&quot;) in Southern Lebanon was founded by those Shi`i Muslims. Byblos has three representatives in the Parliament of Lebanon: two Maronites and one Shi`i Muslim.

In 2014, Christians made up 86.51% and Muslims made up 12.97% of registered voters in Byblos. 64.57% of the voters were Maronite Catholics, 10.45% were Armenian Orthodox, 6.90% were Shiite Muslims and 6.06% were Sunni Muslims.

== Education ==
Byblos is home to the professional schools of the Lebanese American University (LAU). The LAU Byblos Campus houses the Medical School, the Engineering School, the School of Architecture and Design, the Pharmacy School, which offers the only Pharm.D. Program outside the United States accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), the School of Business, and the School of Arts and Sciences.

== Tourism ==

Byblos is re-emerging as an upscale touristic hub. With its ancient port, Phoenician, Roman, and Crusader ruins, sandy beaches and the picturesque mountains that surround it make it an ideal tourist destination. The city is known for its fish restaurants, open-air bars, and outdoor cafes. Yachts cruise into its harbor today as they did in the 1960s and 1970s when Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra were regular visitors to the city. Byblos was crowned as the &quot;Arab Tour Capital&quot; for the year 2016 by the Lebanese minister of tourism in the Grand Serail in Beirut. Byblos was chosen by Condé Nast Traveler as the second best city in the Middle East for 2012, beating Tel Aviv and Dubai, and by the World Tourism Organization as the best Arab tourist city for 2013.

== The Byblos archaeological site ==
* &quot;Ain el-Malik&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s Spring&quot;, about 20 m deep, is a large cavity accessible by spiral stairs. Once it supplied the city with water. According to Plutarch&#x27;s version of the Egyptian Osiris myth, the king&#x27;s servants met Isis on the stairs of the spring and took her to the royal palace, where she found the body of her husband Osiris embedded in one of the palace pillars.

* The &quot;L-shaped Temple&quot; was erected about 2700 BC.

* The Temple of the Obelisks, originally built in 1600–1200 BC on top of the “L-shaped temple,” was moved by archaeologists to its present location. The many small obelisks found in this temple were used as religious offerings. The sanctuary contained a large number of human figurines made of bronze covered with gold leaf, which are now displayed in the National Museum of Beirut.
* The royal necropolis dates back to the second millennium BC and contains tombs of the Byblos kings, including King Ahiram.
* The Bronze Age necropolis of the Gebalite elite, discovered in 2019 at the southern outskirts of the ancient city acropolis.
* The Roman theater was built around AD 218.

== Other historic buildings ==
* Byblos Wax Museum
The Byblos Wax Museum displays wax statues of characters whose dates of origin range from Phoenician times to current days.

* Byblos Fossil Museum
The Byblos Fossil Museum has a collection of fossilised fish, sharks, eel, flying fish, and other marine life, some of which are millions of years old.

* Medieval city wall
The old medieval part of Byblos is surrounded by walls running about 270m from east to west and 200m from north to south.

* Byblos Castle

Byblos Castle was built by the Crusaders in the 12th century. It is located in the archaeological site near the port.

* St John the Baptist Church
Work on the church started during the Crusades in 1115. It was considered a cathedral and was partially destroyed during an earthquake in AD 1170. It was later given to the Maronite bishop as a gift by Prince Yusuf Shihab.

* Sultan Abduljid Mosque
The old mosque by the Castle dates back to the Mamluk period, and adopted the name of Sultan Abdulmejid I after he renovated it.

<doc id="176489" wikidata="Q1740645" url="?curid=176489" title="Joe Versus the Volcano">
<text>Joe Versus the Volcano is a 1990 American romantic comedy film written and directed by John Patrick Shanley and starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, and Frank Marshall of Amblin Entertainment, &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; follows the titular Joe Banks (Hanks), who, after being told he is dying of a rare disease, accepts a financial offer to travel to a South Pacific island and throw himself into a volcano on behalf of the superstitious natives. Along the way, he meets and falls in love with Patricia (Ryan), the woman tasked with taking him there.

&quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; was released theatrically in the United States by Warner Bros. on March 9, 1990. It received mixed reviews from critics, though it was a minor box office success. It has since become a cult film.

==Plot==
Joe Banks is a downtrodden everyman from Staten Island, working a clerical job in a dreary factory for an unpleasant, demanding boss, Frank Waturi. Joyless, listless and chronically sick, Banks regularly visits doctors who can find nothing wrong with him. Finally, Dr. Ellison diagnoses an incurable disease called a &quot;brain cloud&quot;, which has no symptoms, but will kill him within five or six months. Ellison says that the symptoms he has been experiencing are actually psychosomatic, caused by trauma in his previous job as a firefighter. Ellison advises him to live the few remaining months of his life well. Joe tells his boss off, quits his job, and asks former coworker DeDe out on a date. Their date is a success, but when Joe tells DeDe that he is dying, she tells him she cannot deal with the revelation and leaves.

The next day, a wealthy industrialist named Samuel Graynamore makes Joe an unexpected proposition. Graynamore needs &quot;bubaru&quot;, a mineral essential for manufacturing superconductors. There are deposits of it on the tiny Pacific island of Waponi Woo, but the resident Waponis will only let him mine it if he solves a problem for them. They believe that the fire god of the volcano on their island must be appeased by a voluntary human sacrifice once every century, but none of them are willing to volunteer this time around. Graynamore offers to pay for whatever Joe wants to enjoy his final days, as long as he jumps into the volcano within 20 days. With nothing to lose, Joe accepts.

Joe spends a day and a night out on the town in New York City, where he solicits advice on everything from style to living life to the fullest from his chauffeur, Marshall. He also purchases four top-of-the-line, waterproof steamer trunks from a fanatically dedicated luggage salesman.

Joe then flies to Los Angeles, where he is met by one of Graynamore&#x27;s daughters, Angelica, a flighty socialite. The next morning, Angelica takes Joe to her father&#x27;s yacht, the &quot;Tweedledee&quot;. The captain is her half-sister Patricia. Patricia has reluctantly agreed to take Joe to Waponi Woo; Graynamore has promised to give her the yacht in return.

After an awkward beginning, Joe and Patricia begin to bond. Then they run into a typhoon. Patricia is knocked unconscious and flung overboard. After Joe jumps in to rescue her, lightning strikes, sinking the yacht. Joe is able to construct a raft by lashing together his steamer trunks. Patricia does not regain consciousness for several days. Joe doles out the small supply of fresh water to her, while he gradually becomes delirious from thirst. He experiences a revelation during his delirium and thanks God for his life. When Patricia finally awakens, she is deeply touched by Joe&#x27;s self-sacrifice. They then find that they have luckily drifted to their destination.

The Waponis treat them to a grand feast. Their leader, Chief Tobi, asks one last time if anyone else will volunteer, but there are no takers and Joe heads to the volcano. Patricia tries to stop him, declaring her love for him. He admits he loves her as well, &quot;but the timing stinks.&quot; Patricia persuades Joe to have the chief marry them.

Afterwards, Patricia refuses to be separated from her new husband. When Joe is unable to dissuade her, they jump in together, but the volcano erupts at that moment, blowing them out into the ocean. The island sinks, but Joe and Patricia land near Joe&#x27;s trusty steamer trunks. At first ecstatic about their miraculous salvation, Joe tells Patricia about his fatal brain cloud. She recognizes the name of Joe&#x27;s doctor as that of her father&#x27;s crony and realizes that Joe has been set up. He is not dying and they can live happily ever after.

==Cast==

In addition, two other notable actors in smaller roles are Nathan Lane as Baw, the Waponi advance man; and Carol Kane, credited as Lisa LeBlanc, a hairdresser.

==Themes and visual motifs==
&quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; contains themes pertaining to mortality and the search for meaning and a sense of purpose in one&#x27;s life. Writer-director John Patrick Shanley said of his inspiration for making the film:
I started to experience &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; in New York a couple of years ago because all of my smaller problems were taken away, so I was faced with the really big problems like mortality and being alive on earth for a limited amount of time and what to do with that time. When you&#x27;re a working stiff, you don&#x27;t have as much time to brood on these things. [So] I sort of decided to write a film about it and how it might be overcome.

Regarding the film&#x27;s exploration of coming to terms with one&#x27;s own mortality, Shanley stated:
Almost all of us are in denial about death. And the weird thing is, you think, &quot;They do that because if you were to worry about death you couldn&#x27;t enjoy your life.&quot; But I think the reverse is true—if you don&#x27;t recognize your mortality, you&#x27;re tiptoeing through life and not letting in the full reality of what it is. When Joe lets that in, that&#x27;s when life comes flooding in.

The film features a lightning-bolt-like symbol as a recurring motif, first appearing both in the logo of American Panascope—the fictional company at which Joe is initially employed—and as the shape of the pathway that leads to the American Panascope factory. The pattern also appears as a crack in a wall of Joe&#x27;s apartment; in the lightning bolt that strikes and sinks the &quot;Tweedledee&quot;; and in the procession of the Waponis to the top of the volcano. Film critic Glenn Erickson wrote: &quot;The zigzag crack represents both the fear we humans need to overcome, and the circuitous, detour-ridden paths our lives become when we don&#x27;t aim straight for the truth. Like the absurd walkway leading to the hellish Panascope factory [...] we instead walk Joe&#x27;s &quot;crooked road&quot; of doubt, cynicism and fear of life itself [...] &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; wants you [to] shuck off your zombie rags and stop being a Pod Person.&quot;

==Production==
===Writing and development===
Shanley drew inspiration from his own life experiences in writing &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot;. The portrayal of the American Panascope working environment was influenced by Shanley&#x27;s experience working for a company that manufactured medical equipment (including catheters, endoscopes, and artificial testicles) when he was 18 years old. Shanley based the design of Joe&#x27;s office after the office he worked in while employed there, including the fluorescent lighting and a pipe with a valve that reads, &quot;Do not touch&quot;.

After writing a spec script of &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot;, Shanley sent it to filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Shanley later recalled: &quot;I was in Los Angeles at a hotel doing something, and the phone rang, and it was Spielberg. And he said, &#x27;I read your script and I really like it.&#x27; I said, &#x27;thanks,&#x27; and he said, &#x27;I understand that you want to direct it,&#x27; which I don&#x27;t remember saying, and I said, &#x27;Yes.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;Well, I think that&#x27;s a great idea.&#x27; And that&#x27;s how I got the directing job of &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot;!&quot;

===Filming===
&quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; was executive produced by Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy, and Frank Marshall, and their production company Amblin Entertainment. Filming took place in Hawaii, Los Angeles, and New York. Bo Welch served as the film&#x27;s production designer. The American Panascope factory was a building in Los Angeles; the pathway leading up to the factory, as well as the signage on the building, were added for the film, and smokestacks were matted onto the building in post-production.

Scenes set on the ocean, including the sequence in which the &quot;Tweedledee&quot; is caught in a typhoon, were shot using a large indoor water tank in a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studio.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film opened in 1,082 theaters on March 9, 1990, grossing $9.2 million on its opening weekend. It opened at number two at the U.S. box office, behind &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

&quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; went on to gross a total of $39,404,261.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; erupts with plenty of screwball energy and thoughtful observations about living to the fullest, but its existential ambition may prove too goofy for some audiences.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C+&quot; on scale of A to F.

Vincent Canby wrote in his review: &quot;Not since &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; has there been a big-budget comedy with feet as flat as those of &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot;. Many gifted people contributed to it, but there&#x27;s no disbelieving the grim evidence on the screen.&quot; Upon its release, &quot;Time&quot;″s Andrea Sachs called it a &quot;wan bit of whimsy ... [that] makes no more sense than its synopsis, though Meg Ryan beguiles in three different roles.&quot; Fifteen years later, &quot;Time&quot; critic Richard Schickel listed it as one of his &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;; while acknowledging &quot;there are people who think this film... may be the worst big budget film of modern times,&quot; Schickel disagreed: &quot;...you set aside the routine comic expectations its marketing encouraged, you may find yourself entranced by a movie that is utterly &quot;sui generis&quot;.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; a score of 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;new and fresh and not shy of taking chances... [the film] achieves a kind of magnificent goofiness. Hanks and Ryan are the right actors to inhabit it, because you can never catch them going for a gag that isn&#x27;t there: They inhabit the logic of this bizarre world and play by its rules.&quot; He later brought the film to Ebertfest 2012 and wondered &quot;why he gave 3.5 stars instead of 4.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack, composed by Georges Delerue, was not released in 1990, the year of the movie&#x27;s release. Because of Delerue&#x27;s strong following, a sub-label of Varèse Sarabande released a CD in 2002 (limited to 3,000 copies), and again in 2016 (with a few extra songs, limited to 2,000 copies).

Shanley wrote two songs for the film, &quot;Marooned Without You&quot; and &quot;The Cowboy Song&quot;, the former used thematically throughout and the latter performed by Hanks on the ukulele.

Eric Burdon&#x27;s version of Merle Travis&#x27;s &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; was used at the beginning of the film. After Joe leaves the doctor&#x27;s office, an edited version of Ray Charles&#x27;s version of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; plays. &quot;Mas que Nada&quot; by Sergio Mendes &amp; Brazil &#x27;66 accompanies Joe while he is driven around New York City. A Spanish version of &quot;On The Street Where You Live&quot; is sung while Joe is on his date with DeDe. Elvis Presley&#x27;s version of &quot;Blue Moon&quot; plays as Joe spends his final night before departing on his journey. On the boat trip, the Young Rascals&#x27; version of &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;, the Del-Vikings &quot;Come Go with Me&quot;, and The Ink Spots&#x27; version of &quot;I Cover the Waterfront&quot; are heard. Waponi tribal music includes the melodies &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot; and &quot;Hava Nagila&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; was first released on home video in late 1990. In April 2002, it was released on DVD by Warner Home Video.

The manufacture-on-demand Blu-ray was released through Warner Archive Collection on June 20, 2017, and it received positive reviews for the quality.
It was released on Blu-ray in the UK for the 1st time by Warner Archive on the 10th June 2024

==Stage musical==
In 2012, San Diego&#x27;s Lambs Players Theatre presented the world premiere of a musical based on the film. Directed by Robert Smyth, it featured a book, music and lyrics by Scott Hafso and Darcy Phillips, with musical direction by Jon Lorenz and additional musical arrangements by Taylor Peckham.

<doc id="176492" wikidata="Q1282276" url="?curid=176492" title="Patriarchate">
<text>Patriarchate (, ; , &quot;patriarcheîon&quot;) is an ecclesiological term in Christianity, designating the office and jurisdiction of an ecclesiastical patriarch. 
According to Christian tradition three patriarchates were established by the apostles as apostolic sees in the 1st century: Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria (recognized by the Council of Nicaea). Constantinople was added in the 4th century and Jerusalem in the 5th century. Eventually, together, these five were recognised as the pentarchy by the Council of Chalcedon in 451.

In the rest of the history of Christianity, a few other patriarchates were gradually recognised by any of these above ancient episcopal sees. With time, eventually some of them fell due to military occupations following the Islamic conquests of the Middle East and North Africa, and became titular or honorary patriarchates with no actual institutional jurisdiction on the original site.

== History ==
As Christianity expanded in the Roman Empire, larger concentrations of believers were to be found in urban environments. The Bishop of such cities came to hold a pre-eminence of honour in the province of which his diocese was the capital, with some eventually gaining a primacy even over other provinces with their own primus inter pares. The Council of Nicea codified this arrangement into canon law in accordance with the growing standardization of ecclesiastical diocesan structure along the lines of secular Roman blueprints. It also gave the first documented use of the term &quot;Metropolitan&quot; in reference to such bishops as had the presidency over a province. Meanwhile Rome, Alexandria and Antioch had grown in ecclesiastical prominence such that by the early 4th century they had long-recognized jurisdiction over more than one province of bishops each. Alexandria had attained primacy over Roman Egypt, Roman Libya, and Pentapolis. Rome had Primatial authority over provinces within 100 miles of the city. By virtue of their authority over multiple provinces, the Sees of Rome Alexandria and Antioch were by this time already exercising &quot;supra-metropolitan&quot; jurisdiction resembling that which would later become known as Patriarchates. All provinces of Italy were under the broader Primatial oversight of the Archbishop of Rome by the end of the 4th century.

With the Imperial Capital having moved to Byzantium in 330, the renamed city of Constantinople became increasingly important in church affairs of the Greek East. The See of Constantinople was granted Archiepiscopal status prior to a council held in the city in 381, which ranked it second in honour after Rome. Archbishop Atticus would do much to expand the jurisdictional reach of the See in the early 5th century. Following the Council of Ephesus in 431, Bishop Juvenal of Jerusalem began to exert jurisdictional oversight across all three provinces of Roman Palestine, seeking to make Jerusalem into a Metropolitan See, but Cyril of Alexandria and Pope Leo I opposed the separation of Jerusalem from suffrage to Cæsarea and, more broadly, Antioch. Juvenal went as far as to claim Metropolitan authority over Roman Arabia and Phoenicia. At the Council of Chalcedon negotiations with Archbishop Maximus of Antioch resulted in approval of oversight over all of Palestine but no further. The attendees of the council, which included the bishops of Palestine, thus consented to the establishment of the Metropolitinate of Jerusalem. The extent of the oversight granted to the jurisdiction at Chalcedon was both a significant expansion on the precedent established at Nicea and was supra-Metropolitan in scale alongside Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria and Antioch. In light of this, a century later Emperor Justinian would recognise Jerusalem as one of five Patriarchates.

The East–West Schism of 1054 split the Latin Church&#x27;s see of Rome from the Byzantine patriarchates of the East, thus forming the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The four Eastern Orthodox patriarchates (Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem), along with their Latin Catholic counterpart in the West, Rome, are distinguished as &quot;senior&quot; (Greek: πρεσβυγενή, &quot;presbygenē&quot;, &quot;senior-born&quot;) or &quot;ancient&quot; (παλαίφατα, &quot;palèphata&quot;, &quot;of ancient fame&quot;) and are among the apostolic sees, traditionally having had one of the apostles or evangelists as their first bishop: Andrew, Mark, Peter, James, and Peter again, respectively. In the case of Constantinople, Andrew is said to have visited the city of Byzantium in 38 AD (not Constantinople, as the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great had not yet declared Constantinople in 330 AD as the new capital of the Eastern Roman Empire on the grounds of the former city of Byzantium). According to tradition, Andrew appointed the bishop Stachys the Apostle who remained bishop in Byzantium until 54 AD. Therefore in the case of Constantinople the apostolic see is the See of Byzantium.

== Roman Catholic Church ==
There are seven current patriarchates within the Catholic Church. Six are patriarchates of Eastern Catholic Churches: Alexandria (Coptic), Antioch (Maronite, Melkite, Syriac), Baghdad (Chaldean), and Cilicia (Armenian). The pope is the Patriarch of The West after Pope Francis restored the title in 2024.

There are also four major archbishops, who operate as patriarch of their autonomous church, but for historical or procedural reasons are not recognized as a full patriarch. The main difference being that a patriarch&#x27;s election is communicated to the pope, as a sign of communion between equals, but a major archbishop&#x27;s election must be approved by the pope.

In addition, there are four titular patriarchates - diocesan bishops whose dioceses have been given the honorific title of patriarchate for various historical reasons, but are not heads of autonomous churches &quot;sui iuris&quot;. These include the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, of Lisbon, Venice and the East Indies.

Some of the Eastern Catholic patriarchates are active on the same territories. Damascus is the seat of the Syriac Catholic and the Melkite Catholic Patriarchates of Antioch, while the Maronite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch has its see in Bkerké, Lebanon.

== Eastern Orthodox Church ==
Nine of the current autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches, including the four ancient churches of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem mentioned above, are organized as patriarchates. In chronological order of establishment, the other five are: Bulgarian Patriarchate (the oldest one following the Pentarchy), Georgian Patriarchate, Serbian Patriarchate, Moscow Patriarchate and Romanian Patriarchate.

The Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch moved its headquarters to Damascus in the 13th century, during the reign of the Egyptian Mamelukes, conquerors of Syria. The Christian community had flourished in Damascus since apostolic times (Acts 9). However, the patriarchate is still called the Patriarchate of Antioch.

A patriarchate has &quot;legal personality&quot; in some legal jurisdictions, that means it is treated as a corporation. For example, the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem filed a lawsuit in New York, decided in 1999, against Christie&#x27;s Auction House, disputing the ownership of the Archimedes Palimpsest.

== Oriental Orthodoxy ==
There are several patriarchates within Oriental Orthodoxy. These include the four ancient churches of Alexandria, Jerusalem (Armenian), Antioch, and Constantinople (Armenian). Two other patriarchates have been established: the Ethiopian Patriarchate and the Eritrean Patriarchate. In addition, there are a number of autocephalous churches which function as patriarchates although not using the title: the Indian Orthodox Church, the Armenian Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin, and the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia.

==Church of the East==
Patriarch of the Church of the East is the head of the Church of the East. Today, there are three rival patriarchs: 
*Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East
*Catholicos Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East
* Chaldean Catholic patriarch of Baghdad (of the Catholic church)

==Protestantism==
The head of the Czechoslovak Hussite Church is also called a Patriarch.

== Apostolic Catholic Church ==
The Patriarch of the Apostolic Catholic Church is called a Patriarch.

<doc id="176494" wikidata="Q1054218" url="?curid=176494" title="Portland Sea Dogs">
<text>The Portland Sea Dogs are a Minor League Baseball team based in Portland, Maine, playing in the Eastern League. Established in 1994, the Sea Dogs are the Double-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox.

Originally affiliated with the Florida Marlins, the Sea Dogs became part of the Red Sox system for the 2003 season. The team went to the Eastern League championship series in 2005, losing to the Akron Aeros; and again in 2006, when they defeated the Aeros to win the first Double-A championship for a Red Sox farm team since the New Britain Red Sox in 1983.

All games are carried on a network of radio stations with Emma Tiedemann providing the play-by-play, with the flagship WPEI doing both home and away games.

==History==

Minor league baseball returned to Maine on October 4, 1992, when Portland was awarded one of two Eastern League expansion franchises (the other being the New Haven Ravens) to begin play in April 1994. The Sea Dogs signed an affiliation agreement with the Florida Marlins on May 3, 1993, beginning a nine-season relationship. The city renovated Hadlock Field, transforming a high-school stadium into a professional ballpark. City manager Robert Ganley led efforts to renovate Hadlock Field and return professional baseball to Portland.

The team won its first game, defeating the Reading Phillies on the road 2–1, with the help of a 14th-inning home run by future major league catcher Charles Johnson. The team opened Hadlock Field on April 18, 1994, losing 7–6 to the Albany-Colonie Yankees.

Cartoonist Guy Gilchrist designed the team&#x27;s logo. His comic strip &quot;Mudpie&quot; had a series of strips in which the young cat&#x27;s family visit the Portland area and attend a Sea Dogs game.

The team won its sole league title on September 17, 2006, defeating the Akron Aeros 8–5, in a rematch of the series from the previous year.

When Major League Baseball restructured Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Sea Dogs were organized into the Double-A Northeast. In 2022, the division was renamed the Eastern League, the name used by the regional circuit before the 2021 reorganization.

Ahead of the 2023 season, the Sea Dogs&#x27; longtime owners, the Burke family, sold the team to Diamond Baseball Holdings.

In August 2024, Portland cartoonist Lincoln Peirce featured the team in his comic strip Big Nate.

==Stadium==
The Sea Dogs&#x27; home stadium is Delta Dental Park at Hadlock Field, named after longtime Portland High School baseball coach Edson Hadlock. It has a seating capacity of 7,368. Hadlock Field is often visited by vacationing celebrities, such as former NFL coach Bill Parcells, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush, and his wife Barbara. In left field stands the Maine Monster, a replica of Fenway Park&#x27;s Green Monster, complete with Coke bottle and Citgo sign. Along the right-field foul line just beyond first base, a picnic pavilion is available for group outings from 20 up to 300 people. In 2006, a new pavilion opened above the right-field wall over the Sea Dogs bullpen. Modeled after the Green Monster seats at Fenway Park in Boston, it seats up to 393 people and gives fans an opportunity to catch a home run ball.

Slugger the Sea Dog has been the Sea Dogs&#x27; mascot since May 6, 1994.

==Season records==
The team was a member of the Northeast division of the Eastern League from 1994 to 2020 and the Northeast division of Double-A Northeast in 2021. They have been members of the Eastern League&#x27;s Northeast division since 2022.

In the below table, &quot;Place&quot; represents finish within the team&#x27;s division for the overall regular reason. Note that in 2019 and 2022, the Eastern League played a split-season schedule, with first-half and second-half winners advancing to the postseason.

==Roster==
==Broadcasts==

Sea Dogs games can be heard on the following radio stations: 95.5 WPPI Topsham, Maine, 95.9 WPEI: Saco, Maine, 780 WEZR: Rumford, Maine, and 1450 WPNO: South Paris, Maine. Game audio is also streamed for free on MiLB.com

<doc id="176496" wikidata="Q16847489" url="?curid=176496" title="Infallibility">
<text>Infallibility refers to an inability to be wrong. It can be applied within a specific domain, or it can be used as a more general adjective. The term has significance in both epistemology and theology, and its meaning and significance in both fields is the subject of continued debate.

==In philosophy==
Epistemology, a branch of philosophy, is concerned with the question of what, if anything, humans can know. The answer to the issue of whether or not a human can be infallible depends on the philosophical school.

*Advocates of philosophical skepticism claim that one cannot know anything with certainty, much less be infallible. 
*Infallibilists hold that knowledge requires absolute certainty, in the sense that if one knows that something is true, it is impossible that it could have turned out to be false.
*Advocates of subjectivism claim that there is no objective reality or truth, and therefore anyone can be considered infallible, since whatever is within a person&#x27;s consciousness &quot;is&quot; considered the real and the true.
*Advocates of reason and rationality claim that one &quot;can&quot; gain certainty of knowledge, through a process of extreme refinement measures unlikely to be perfected enough for someone to assurably say &quot;certainty of this knowledge is absolute&quot;, yet also assume by chance that one could land on the objective without the knowledge being confidently described as &quot;universally certain&quot;, thus as a result, advocates tend to avoid this altogether and instead rely upon Occam&#x27;s Razor as a suitable means for obtaining knowledge.

==In theology==
===Christianity===

&quot;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church&quot; defines infallibility as &quot;Inability to err in teaching revealed truth&quot;. Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theology claim that the Church is infallible, but disagree as to where infallibility exists, whether in doctrines, scripture, or church authorities.

In Catholic theology, Jesus, who is the Truth, is infallible, but only a special act of teaching by the church&#x27;s bishops may properly be called &quot;infallible&quot;. According to the First Vatican Council (1869–71) and as reaffirmed at Vatican II (1962–1965), the earthly head of the Catholic Church, the Pope, is infallible when speaking &quot;ex cathedra&quot; on matters of faith and morals (that is, when he explicitly intends to use his papal office to teach the whole Church definitively and irreformably on matters which deal directly with faith and morals). However, papal infallibility does not extend beyond such cases, thus making it possible for a Pope to sin and to be incorrect. Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of bishops as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true.

In contrast, Protestant and non-denominational Christian churches believe that the Christian Church is indeed fallible, as evidenced by the requirement of Christ&#x27;s sacrifice on the cross to pay for the sins of the world, including those of his Church, and that only God&#x27;s word in scripture is infallible. They also completely reject the Catholic claim regarding papal infallibility, citing not just scriptural reasons, but also the many times popes have contradicted each other and the history of mistakes committed by many popes throughout Roman Catholic Church history.

Because of the complexity in defining infallibility, some Protestant and non-denominational views confuse papal infallibility with impeccability, as if the Pope were immune from sin. This is not the Catholic Church&#x27;s doctrine, which concedes that Popes can sin and may even contradict one another&#x27;s personal theological opinions. It is evident that the Pope can sin (which every Pope explicitly states in the Confiteor, and whenever he receives the Sacrament of Penance) and a Pope may even succumb to heresy, as suggested in the condemnation by the Third Council of Constantinople (13th and 16th session) which anathematized Pope Honorius I for supporting the heresy of Monothelitism, and which Pope John XXII admitted when he retracted his views on the Beatific vision.

===Islam===
====Universal teachings====
Islam teaches that the teachings and guidance by the Prophets with regard to bringing the message of the One true God is infallible. Islam also teaches that the Quran is an infallible text.

====Additional Shi&#x27;a teachings====

In Shi&#x27;a theology, one of the two branches of Islam, the belief is that the Ahl al-Bayt, including Muhammad, his daughter Fatima Zahra and Shi&#x27;a Imams are all infallible. It is believed that they are infallible in the sense that all statements or teachings made by them can be relied on to be certainly true, that all information believed by themselves is true, and that they have complete knowledge about right and wrong and never intend to disobey God. It is also held by Shi&#x27;as that there were 124,000 Prophets, beginning with Adam and ending with Muhammad - with all, including the last, being infallible in the same sense as the Ahl al-Bayt.

===Judaism===
The notion of infallibility in Judaism as it relates to the Tannaim and Amoraim of the Talmud, as well as the Rishonim, Achronim and modern day Gedolim is one surrounded by debate.

Some who reject infallibility cite the Talmud, Pesachim 94b:
The words of the Mishnah are commented on by numerous commentators, and Yehuda Levi argues that the Geonim and Maimonides perceived that the sages of the Talmud &quot;erred in a matter of astronomy&quot;. Maimonides wrote that the great sages are not expected to advocate positions perfectly in-line with modern science because they were &quot;scholars of that generation,&quot; often basing their assessments of what &quot;they learned from the scholars of the era.&quot;

In the Hasidic tradition, however, infallibility is taught in the Chabad tradition in connection with a rebbe.

===Vaishnavism (Hinduism)===

In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna (Bg 15.16 to 15.20):
=== Baháʼí Faith ===
The Baháʼí Faith teaches the doctrine of the Most Great Infallibility (&quot;al-&#x27;ismah al-kubra&quot;) which applies to the Manifestations of God who founded the world&#x27;s major religions, including Abraham, Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Jesus Christ, Muhammad, as well as the Báb (1819–1850) and Baháʼu&#x27;lláh (1817–1892), the prophet-founder of the faith.

Infallibility also extends to ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá (1844–1921), the son of the faith&#x27;s founder; to the Guardian of the faith Shoghi Effendi (1897–1957); and to the Universal House of Justice, the faith&#x27;s nine-member supreme ruling body.

In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the central religious text of the faith, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh describes himself as having &quot;no partner in the Most Great Infallibility&quot;. He later expounds on the doctrine in the ʼIs͟hráqát, a tablet written circa 1885 to a believer from Azerbaijan.

ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá described infallibility as being of two kinds: the &quot;essential infallibility&quot; of the Manifestations of God, and the &quot;acquired infallibility&quot; of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice.

In the Will and Testament of ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá, he describes both the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice as being &quot;under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One&quot;: Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God. May the wrath, the fierce indignation, the vengeance of God rest upon him!Shoghi Effendi describes the limits of the Guardian&#x27;s infallibility as such:The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters which are related strictly to the Cause and interpretation of the teachings; he is not an infallible authority on other subjects, such as economics, science, etc. When he feels that a certain thing is essential for the protection of the Cause, even if it is something that affects a person personally, he must be obeyed, but when he gives advice, such as that he gave you in a previous letter about your future, it is not binding; you are free to follow it or not as you please.

<doc id="176514" wikidata="Q1472110" url="?curid=176514" title="The Beggar's Opera">
<text>The Beggar&#x27;s Opera is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by John Gay with music arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch. It is one of the watershed plays in Augustan drama and is the only example of the once thriving genre of satirical ballad opera to remain popular today. Ballad operas were satiric musical plays that used some of the conventions of opera, but without recitative. The lyrics of the airs in the piece are set to popular broadside ballads, opera arias, church hymns and folk tunes of the time.

&quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; premiered at the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields Theatre on 29 January 1728 and ran for 62 consecutive performances, the second-longest run in theatre history up to that time (after 146 performances of Robert Cambert&#x27;s &quot;Pomone&quot; in Paris in 1671). The work became Gay&#x27;s greatest success and has been played ever since; it has been called &quot;the most popular play of the eighteenth century&quot;. In 1920, &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; began a revival run of 1,463 performances at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith, London, which was one of the longest runs in history for any piece of musical theatre at that time.

The piece satirised Italian opera, which had become popular in London. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Gay wrote the work more as an anti-opera than an opera, one of its attractions to its 18th-century London public being its lampooning of the Italian opera style and the English public&#x27;s fascination with it.&quot; Instead of the grand music and themes of opera, the work uses familiar tunes and characters that were ordinary people. Some of the songs were by opera composers like Handel, but only the most popular of these were used. The audience could hum along with the music and identify with the characters. The story satirised politics, poverty and injustice, focusing on the theme of corruption at all levels of society. Lavinia Fenton, the first Polly Peachum, became an overnight success. Her pictures were in great demand, verses were written to her and books published about her. After appearing in several comedies, and then in numerous repetitions of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, she ran away with her married lover, Charles Powlett, 3rd Duke of Bolton.

Bertolt Brecht (working from a translation into German by Elisabeth Hauptmann) adapted the work into &quot;Die Dreigroschenoper&quot; (&quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;) in 1928, sticking closely to the original plot and characters but with a new libretto, and mostly new music by Kurt Weill.

== Origin and analysis ==
The original idea of the opera came from Jonathan Swift, who wrote to Alexander Pope on 30 August 1716 asking &quot;...what think you, of a Newgate pastoral among the thieves and whores there?&quot; Their friend, Gay, decided that it would be a satire rather than a pastoral opera. For his original production in 1728, Gay intended all the songs to be sung without any accompaniment, adding to the shocking and gritty atmosphere of his conception. However, a week or so before the opening night, John Rich, the theatre director, insisted on having Johann Christoph Pepusch, a composer associated with his theatre, write a formal French overture (based on two of the songs in the opera, including a fugue based on Lucy&#x27;s 3rd act song &quot;I&#x27;m Like A Skiff on the Ocean Toss&#x27;d&quot;) and also to arrange the 69 songs. Although there is no external evidence of who the arranger was, inspection of the original 1729 score, formally published by Dover Books, demonstrates that Pepusch was the arranger.

The work took satiric aim at the passionate interest of the upper classes in Italian opera, and simultaneously set out to lampoon the notable Whig statesman Robert Walpole, and politicians in general, as well as such notorious criminals as Jonathan Wild, the thief-taker, Claude Duval, the highwayman, and Jack Sheppard, the prison-breaker. It also deals with social inequity on a broad scale, primarily through the comparison of low-class thieves and whores with their aristocratic and bourgeois &quot;betters.&quot;

The airs of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; in part allude to well-known popular ballads, and Gay&#x27;s lyrics sometimes play with their wording in order to amuse and entertain the audience. Gay used Scottish folk melodies mostly taken from the poet Allan Ramsay&#x27;s hugely popular collection &quot;The Gentle Shepherd&quot; (1725) plus two French tunes (including the carol &quot;Quelle est cette odeur agréable?&quot; for his song &quot;Fill Every Glass&quot;), to serve his hilariously pointed and irreverent texts. Macheath&#x27;s satire on modern society (&quot;The modes of the court so common are grown&quot;) is also sung to Henry Purcell&#x27;s Lillibullero. Pepusch composed an overture and arranged all the tunes shortly before the opening night at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields on 28 January 1728. However, all that remains of Pepusch&#x27;s score are the overture (with complete instrumentation) and the melodies of the songs without figured basses. Various reconstructions have been attempted, and a 1990 reconstruction of the score by American composer Jonathan Dobin has been used in a number of modern productions.

Gay uses the operatic norm of three acts (as opposed to the standard in spoken drama of the time of five acts), and tightly controls the dialogue and plot so that there are surprises in each of the forty-five fast-paced scenes and 68 short songs. The success of the opera was accompanied by a public desire for keepsakes and mementos, ranging from images of Polly on fans and clothing, playing cards and fire-screens, broadsides featuring all the characters, and the rapidly published musical score of the opera.

The play is sometimes seen to be a reactionary call for libertarian values in response to the growing power of the Whig party. It may also have been influenced by the then-popular ideology of John Locke that men should be allowed their natural liberties; these democratic strains of thought influenced the populist movements of the time, of which &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; was a part.

The character of Macheath has been considered by critics as both a hero and an anti-hero. Harold Gene Moss, arguing that Macheath is a noble character, has written, &quot;[one] whose drives are toward love and the vital passions, Macheath becomes an almost Christ-like victim of the decadence surrounding him.&quot; Contrarily, John Richardson in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Eighteenth-Century Life&quot; has argued that Macheath is powerful as a literary figure precisely because he stands against any interpretation, &quot;against expectation and illusion.&quot; He is now thought to have been modeled on the gentleman highwayman, Claude Duval, although interest in criminals had recently been raised by Jack Sheppard&#x27;s escapes from Newgate.

&quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; has had an influence on all later British stage comedies, especially on nineteenth century British comic opera and the modern musical.

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

Peachum, a fence and thief-catcher, justifies his actions. Mrs Peachum, overhearing her husband&#x27;s blacklisting of unproductive thieves, protests regarding one of them: Bob Booty (the nickname of Robert Walpole). The Peachums discover that Polly, their daughter, has secretly married Macheath, the famous highwayman, who is Peachum&#x27;s principal client. Upset to learn they will no longer be able to use Polly in their business, Peachum and his wife ask how Polly will support such a husband &quot;in Gaming, Drinking and Whoring.&quot; Nevertheless, they conclude that the match may be more profitable to the Peachums if the husband can be killed for his money. They leave to carry out this errand. However, Polly has hidden Macheath.

===Act 2===

Macheath goes to a tavern where he is surrounded by women of dubious virtue who, despite their class, compete in displaying perfect drawing-room manners, although the subject of their conversation is their success in picking pockets and shoplifting. Macheath discovers, too late, that two of them (Jenny Diver, Suky Tawdry) have contracted with Peachum to capture him, and he becomes a prisoner in Newgate prison. The prison is run by Peachum&#x27;s associate, the corrupt jailer Lockit. His daughter, Lucy Lockit, has the opportunity to scold Macheath for having agreed to marry her and then broken this promise. She tells him that to see him tortured would give her pleasure. Macheath pacifies her, but Polly arrives and claims him as her husband. Macheath tells Lucy that Polly is crazy. Lucy helps Macheath to escape by stealing her father&#x27;s keys. Her father learns of Macheath&#x27;s promise to marry her and worries that if Macheath is recaptured and hanged, his fortune might be subject to Peachum&#x27;s claims. Lockit and Peachum discover Macheath&#x27;s hiding place. They decide to split his fortune.

===Act 3===

Meanwhile, Polly visits Lucy to try to reach an agreement, but Lucy tries to poison her. Polly narrowly avoids the poisoned drink, and the two girls find out that Macheath has been recaptured owing to the inebriated Mrs Diana Trapes. They plead with their fathers for Macheath&#x27;s life. However, Macheath now finds that four more pregnant women each claim him as their husband. He declares that he is ready to be hanged. The narrator (the Beggar), notes that although in a properly moral ending Macheath and the other villains would be hanged, the audience demands a happy ending, and so Macheath is reprieved, and all are invited to a dance of celebration, to celebrate his wedding to Polly.

== Reaction ==
&quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; was met with widely varying reactions. Its popularity was documented in &quot;The Craftsman&quot; with the following entries:

&quot;This Week a Dramatick Entertainment has been exhibited at the Theatre in Lincoln&#x27;s-Inn-Fields, entitled The Beggar&#x27;s Opera, which has met with a general Applause, insomuch that the Waggs say it has made Rich very Gay, and probably will make Gay very Rich.&quot; (3 February 1728)

&quot;We hear that the British Opera, commonly called &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, continues to be acted, at the Theatre in Lincoln&#x27;s-Inn Fields with general Applause, to the great Mortification of the Performers and Admirers of the Outlandish Opera in the Haymarket.&quot; (17 February 1728)

Two weeks after opening night, an article appeared in &quot;The Craftsman&quot;, the leading opposition newspaper, ostensibly protesting at Gay&#x27;s work as libellous and ironically assisting him in satirising the Walpole establishment by taking the government&#x27;s side:

It will, I know, be said, by these libertine Stage-Players, that the Satire is general; and that it discovers a Consciousness of Guilt for any particular Man to apply it to Himself. But they seem to forget that there are such things as Innuendo&#x27;s (a never-failing Method of explaining Libels)… Nay the very Title of this Piece and the principal Character, which is that of a Highwayman, sufficiently discover the mischievous Design of it; since by this Character every Body will understand One, who makes it his Business arbitrarily to levy and collect Money on the People for his own Use, and of which he always dreads to give an Account – Is not this squinting with a vengeance, and wounding Persons in Authority through the Sides of a common Malefactor?

The commentator notes the Beggar&#x27;s last remark: &quot;That the lower People have their Vices in a Degree as well as the Rich, and are punished for them,&quot; implying that rich People are not so punished.

Criticism of Gay&#x27;s opera continued long after its publication. In 1776, John Hawkins wrote in his History of Music that due to the opera&#x27;s popularity, &quot;Rapine and violence have been gradually increasing&quot; solely because the rising generation of young men desired to imitate the character Macheath. Hawkins blamed Gay for tempting these men with &quot;the charms of idleness and criminal pleasure,&quot; which Hawkins saw Macheath as representing and glorifying.

==Legacy ==
=== Sequel ===
In 1729, Gay wrote a sequel, &quot;Polly&quot;, set in the West Indies: Macheath, sentenced to transportation, has escaped and become a pirate, while Mrs Trapes has set up in white-slaving and shanghais Polly to sell her to the wealthy planter Mr Ducat. Polly escapes dressed as a boy, and after many adventures marries the son of a Carib chief.

The political satire, however, was even more pointed in &quot;Polly&quot; than in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, with the result that Prime Minister Robert Walpole leaned on the Lord Chamberlain to have it banned, and it was not performed until fifty years later.

=== Adaptations ===

As was typical practice of the time in London, a commemorative &quot;score&quot; of the entire opera was assembled and published quickly. As was common, this consisted of the fully arranged overture followed by the melodies of the 69 songs, supported by only the simplest bass accompaniments. There are no indications of dance music, accompanying instrumental figures or the like, except in three instances: Lucy&#x27;s &quot;Is Then His Fate Decree&#x27;d Sir&quot; – one measure of descending scale marked &quot;Viol.&quot; –; Trape&#x27;s &quot;In the Days of My Youth&quot;, in which the &quot;fa la la chorus is written as &quot;viol.&quot;; and the final reprieve dance, Macheath&#x27;s &quot;Thus I Stand Like A Turk&quot;, which includes two sections of 16 measures of &quot;dance&quot; marked &quot;viol.&quot; (See the 1729 score, formerly published by Dover).

The absence of the original performing parts has allowed producers and arrangers free rein. The tradition of personalised arrangements, dating back at least as far as Thomas Arne&#x27;s later 18th century arrangements, continues today, running the gamut of musical styles from Romantic to Baroque: Austin, Britten, Sargent, Bonynge, Dobin and other conductors have each imbued the songs with a personal stamp, highlighting different aspects of characterisation. The hornpipe tune to which Nancy Dawson danced between acts in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; in the mid-1700s is now used for &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot;. Following is a list of some of the most highly regarded 20th-century arrangements and settings of the opera.
* In 1920, the baritone Frederic Austin newly arranged the music (and also sang the role of Peachum) for the long-running production (1,463 performances) at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. The Irish baritone Frederick Ranalow sang the role of Captain Macheath in every performance. In 1955 this version was recorded by conductor Sir Malcolm Sargent with John Cameron as Macheath and Monica Sinclair as Lucy.
* In 1928, on the 200th anniversary of the original production, Bertolt Brecht (words) and Kurt Weill (music) created a popular new musical adaptation of the work in Germany entitled &quot;Die Dreigroschenoper&quot; (&quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;). In this work, the original plot is followed fairly closely (although the time is brought forward over a hundred years) but the music is almost all new.
* In 1946, John La Touche (book and lyrics) and Duke Ellington (music) created another musical adaptation of the work for Broadway entitled &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Holiday&quot;. An updated rendition of the story focused on a corrupt world inhabited by rakish Mobsters, raffish Madams and their dissolute whores, panhandlers and street people.
* In 1948, Benjamin Britten created an adaptation with new harmonisations and arrangements of pre-existing tunes. Additional dialogue was written by the producer, Tyrone Guthrie. Peter Pears was the first singer of Macheath. It was dedicated to James Haldane Lawrie, who would go on to chair the English Opera Group.
* The opera was made into a film version in 1953, and starred Laurence Olivier as Captain Macheath.
* In 1975, Czech playwright (and future president) Václav Havel created a non-musical adaptation.
* In 1977, the Nigerian Nobel Prize-winning playwright and dramatist Wole Soyinka wrote, produced and directed &quot;Opera Wonyosi&quot; (published 1981), an adaptation of both John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;; most of his characters as well as some of the arias are from the two earlier plays.
* In 1978, the Brazilian singer-songwriter Chico Buarque wrote &quot;Ópera do Malandro&quot; (1978), an adaptation of both John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; and Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera,&quot; with new songs and set in 1940s Rio de Janeiro, which was later adapted as a film by director Ruy Guerra.
* In 1981 Richard Bonynge and Douglas Gamley arranged a new edition for The Australian Opera (now Opera Australia). It was recorded the same year with Joan Sutherland, Kiri Te Kanawa, James Morris and Angela Lansbury.
* The opera was adapted for BBC television in 1983. This production was directed by Jonathan Miller and starred Roger Daltrey in the role of Macheath, Stratford Johns as Peachum, Gary Tibbs as Filch, and Bob Hoskins as the Beggar. The &quot;happy&quot; ending was changed so that Macheath is hanged instead of being reprieved.
* In 1984 in the play (and later film) &quot;A Chorus of Disapproval&quot; by Alan Ayckbourn, an amateur production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; is a major plot driver and excerpts are performed.
* In 1990 Jonathan Dobin created his period-styled performing edition for the Ten Ten Players (now Theatre 2020) and it has since been performed at venues throughout the United States. This edition is based on the 1728 printed edition and includes the full overture as detailed by Pepusch and fleshes out all of the remaining 69 airs and dances of the original 18th century production.
* In 1998, the all female Japanese troupe, Takarazuka Revue, produced an adaptation titled &quot;Speakeasy&quot;. The play was Maya Miki&#x27;s retirement play.
* In 2008 the Sydney Theatre Company of Australia and Out of Joint Theatre Company co-produced a version entitled &quot;The Convict&#x27;s Opera&quot; written by Stephen Jeffreys and directed by Max Stafford-Clark. This version is set aboard a convict ship bound for New South Wales, where convicts are putting on a version of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. The lives of the convicts partly mirror their characters in &quot;The Beggars&#x27; Opera&quot;, and modern popular songs are performed throughout the piece. &quot;The Convict&#x27;s Opera&quot; began touring the UK in early 2009.
* The theatre company Vanishing Point created a modern production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; in 2009 for The Royal Lyceum Theatre and Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, set in a near-future apocalypse world. It features music from A Band Called Quinn.
* The original opera was performed in an 18th-century setting at the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre in summer 2011 in a production directed by Lucy Bailey.
* In 2019, Kneehigh Theatre Company in association with Liverpool Everyman &amp; Playhouse created and toured a reinvention of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, called &quot;Dead Dog in a Suitcase (and other love songs)&quot;.
*In 2021, French mezzo-soprano and composer Hélène Ducos created &quot;Minuit Montmartre&quot;, a four-act opera inspired by &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. The first performance took place in Paris on 10 July.

<doc id="176522" wikidata="Q6043" url="?curid=176522" title="Macchi C.200 Saetta">
<text>The Macchi C.200 Saetta (Italian: &quot;Lightning&quot;), or MC.200, is a fighter aircraft developed and manufactured by Aeronautica Macchi in Italy. Various versions were flown by the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Italian Air Force) who used the type throughout the Second World War.

The C.200 was designed by Mario Castoldi, Macchi&#x27;s lead designer, to serve as a modern monoplane fighter aircraft, furnished with retractable landing gear and powered by a radial engine. The C.200 possessed excellent maneuverability, and its general flying characteristics left little to be desired. Its stability in a high-speed dive was exceptional, but it was underpowered and underarmed in comparison to its contemporaries. Early on, there were a number of crashes caused by stability problems, nearly resulting in the grounding of the type; these problems were ultimately addressed via aerodynamic modifications to the wing.

From the time Italy entered the Second World War on 10 June 1940, until the signing of the armistice of 8 September 1943, the C. 200 flew more operational sorties than any other Italian aircraft. The &quot;Saetta&quot; saw operational service in Greece, North Africa, Yugoslavia, across the Mediterranean, and in the Soviet Union (where it obtained an excellent kill to loss ratio of 88 to 15). The plane&#x27;s very strong all-metal construction and air-cooled engine made the aircraft ideal for conducting ground attack missions; several units flew it as a fighter-bomber. Over 1,000 aircraft had been constructed by the end of the war.

==Development==

===Origins===
In early 1935 Mario Castoldi, lead designer of Italian aircraft company Macchi, commenced work on a series of design studies for a modern monoplane fighter aircraft, which was to be furnished with retractable landing gear. Castoldi had previously designed several racing aircraft that had competed for the Schneider Trophy, including the Macchi M.39, which won the competition in 1926. He had also designed the M.C. 72. From an early stage, the concept aircraft that emerged from these studies became known as the &quot;C.200&quot;.

In 1936, in the aftermath of Italy&#x27;s campaigns in East Africa, an official program was initiated with the aim of completely re-equipping the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; with a new interceptor aircraft of modern design. The 10 February 1936 specifications, formulated and published by the &quot;Ministero dell&#x27;Aeronatica&quot;, called for an aircraft powered by a single radial engine, which was to be capable of a top speed of and a climb rate of 6,000 meters in 5 minutes. Additional requirements were soon specified: the aircraft was to be capable of being used as an interceptor with a flight endurance time of two hours and armed with a single (later increased to two) machine gun.

===Prototypes===
In response to the prescribed demand for a modern fighter aircraft, Castoldi submitted a proposal for an aircraft based upon his 1935 design studies. On 24 December 1937, the first prototype (MM.336) C.200 conducted its maiden flight at Lonate Pozzolo, Varese, with Macchi chief test pilot Giuseppe Burei at the controls. Officials within the ministry and Macchi&#x27;s design team fought over the retention of the characteristic hump used to enhance cockpit visibility; after a protracted argument, the feature was ultimately retained.

The first prototype was followed by the second prototype early the following year. During testing, the aircraft reportedly attained in a dive free of negative tendencies such as flutter and other aeroelastic issues; although it could achieve only in level flight due to a lack of engine power. Nevertheless, this capability was superior than the performance of the competing Fiat G.50 Freccia, Reggiane Re.2000, A.U.T. 18, IMAM Ro.51, and Caproni-Vizzola F.5; of these, the Re.2000 was seen as the most capable of the C.200&#x27;s rivals, being more maneuverable and capable of greater performance at low altitude but lacking in structural strength.

The C.200 benefitted greatly from preparations that were being made for major expansion of the Italian Air Force, known as Programme R. In 1938, the C.200 was selected as the winner of the tender &quot;Caccia I&quot; (Fighter 1) of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;. This choice came in spite of mixed results during flight testing at Guidonia airport; on 11 June 1938, Major Ugo Borgogno warned that when tight turns at beyond 90° were attempted, the aircraft became extremely difficult to control, including a tendency to turn upside down, mostly to the right and entering into a violent flat spin.

===Production===
Shortly following the completion of the second prototype, an initial order for 99 production aircraft was placed with Macchi. The G.50, which during the same flight tests held at Guidonia airport had out-turned the Macchi, was also placed in limited production, because it had been determined that the former could be brought into service earlier. The decision, or indecision, involved in producing multiple overlapping types led to greater inefficiencies in both production and in operation. In June 1939, production of the C.200 formally commenced.

The most serious handicap was the low production rate of the type. According to some reports, in excess of 22,000 hours in production time was attributed to the use of antiquated construction technology. A lack of urgency shown by the authorities regarding standardisation was also viewed as having negatively affected mass production efforts, particularly in light of the lack of availability of key resources in Italy at the time. In order to improve the rate of output, the C.200 remained almost unchanged throughout its production life, save for adjustments to the cockpit in response to pilot feedback.

In addition to Macchi (who completed 397 airframes), the C.200 was also constructed by Italian aircraft companies Società Italiana Ernesto Breda (556) and SAI Ambrosini (200) under a subcontracting arrangement intended to produce 1,200 aircraft between 1939 and 1943. However, during 1940, the termination of all production of the type was considered in response to aerodynamic performance problems that had caused the loss of multiple aircraft; the type was retained after changes were made to the wing to rectify a tendency to go into an uncontrollable spin that could occur during turns.

In an attempt to improve performance, a C.201 prototype was created with a Fiat A.76 engine; work on this prototype was later abandoned in favour of the Daimler-Benz DB 601-powered C.202. At one point, it was intended that the &quot;Saetta&quot; was to have been replaced outright by the C.202 after only a single year in production. However, the C.200&#x27;s service life was extended because Alfa Romeo proved to be incapable of producing enough of the RA.1000 (license-built DB 601) engines needed by the newer aircraft. This contributed to the decision to construct further C.200s that used C.202 components as an interim measure while waiting for the production rate of the latter&#x27;s engine to be increased.

At the beginning of 1940, Denmark was set to place an order for 12 C.200s to replace its aging Hawker Nimrod fighters, but the deal fell through when Germany invaded Denmark. A total of 1,153 &quot;Saettas&quot; were eventually produced, but only 33 remained operational by the time armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces in September 1943.

==Design==
The Macchi C.200 was a modern all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane, which was equipped with retractable landing gear and an enclosed cockpit. The fuselage was of semi-monocoque construction, with self-sealing fuel tanks under the pilot&#x27;s seat, and in the centre section of the wing. The distinctive &quot;hump&quot; elevated the partially open cockpit to provide the pilot with an unusually wide field of view over the engine. The wing had an advanced system whereby the hydraulically actuated flaps were interconnected with the ailerons, so that when the flaps were lowered the ailerons drooped as well. As a result of its ultimate load factor of 15.1, it could reach speeds as fast as true airspeed during dives.

Power was provided by a Fiat A.74 radial engine, although Castoldi preferred inline engines, and had used them to power all of his previous designs. Under a &quot;direttiva&quot; (air ministry specification) of 1932, Italian industrial leaders had been instructed to concentrate solely on radial engines for fighters, due to their superior reliability. The A.74 was a re-design of the American Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830 SC-4 Twin Wasp by engineers Tranquillo Zerbi and , and was the only Italian-built engine that could provide a level of reliability comparable to Allied designs. The licence-built A.74 engine could be problematic. In late spring 1941, 4o Stormo&#x27;s Macchi C.200s, then based in Sicily, had all the A.74s produced by the Reggiane factory replaced because they were defective. The elite unit had to abort many missions against Malta due to engine problems. While some considered the Macchi C.200 to have been underpowered, the air-cooled radial engine provided some pilot protection during strafing missions. Consequently, the C.200 was often used as a &quot;cacciabombardiere&quot; (fighter-bomber).

The C.200 was typically armed with a pair of Breda-SAFAT machine guns; while these were often considered to be insufficient, the &quot;Saetta&quot; was able to compete with contemporary Allied fighters. According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, perhaps the greatest weakness of the C.200 was its light machine gun armament. Moreover, a radio was not fitted as standard.

Like other early Italian monoplanes, the C.200 suffered from a dangerous tendency to go into a spin. Early production C.200 aircraft showed autorotation problems similar to those found in the Fiat G.50 Freccia, IMAM Ro.51, and the Aeronautica Umbra Trojani AUT.18. At the beginning of 1940, a pair of deadly accidents occurred due to autorotation. Aircraft production and deliveries were halted while the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; evaluated the potential for abandoning use of the type, as the skill involved in flying the C.200 was considered to be beyond that of the average pilot. The problem was a product of the profile of the wing. Castoldi soon tested a new profile, but a solution to the autorotation problem was found by Sergio Stefanutti, chief designer of SAI Ambrosini in Passignano sul Trasimeno, based on studies conducted by German aircraft engineer Willy Messerschmitt and the American National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). He redesigned the wing section with a variable, instead of constant, profile, which was achieved by covering parts of the wings with plywood.

The new wing entered production in 1939–1940 at SAI Ambrosini and became standard on the aircraft manufactured by Aermacchi and Breda, a licensed manufacturer. After the modified wing of the &quot;Saetta&quot; was introduced, the C.200 proved to be, for a time, the foremost Italian fighter. The first production C.200 series, did not have armour fitted to protect the pilots, as a weight-saving measure. Armour plating was incorporated when frontline units were going to replace the &quot;Saettas&quot; with the new Macchi C.202 &quot;Folgore&quot; (Thunderbolt) but in only a limited number of aircraft. After the armour was fitted, the aircraft could become difficult to fly. During aerobatic maneuvers, one could enter an extremely difficult-to-control flat spin, which would force the pilot to bail out. On 22 July 1941, Leonardo Ferrulli, one of the top-scoring &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; pilots, encountered the problem and was forced to bail out over Sicily.

==Operational history==

===Introduction===
In August 1939, about 30 C.200 Saettas were delivered to the 10th &quot;Gruppo&quot; of the 4th &quot;Stormo&quot;, stationed in North Africa. However, pilots of this elite unit of the Regia Aeronautica opposed the adoption of the C.200, preferring the more manouvrable Fiat CR.42 instead. Accordingly, the Macchis were then transferred to the 6th &quot;Gruppo&quot; of the 1st &quot;Stormo&quot; in Sicily, who were enthusiastic supporters of the new fighter, and to the 152nd &quot;Gruppo&quot; of the 54th &quot;Stormo&quot; in Vergiate. Further units received the type during peacetime, including the 153rd &quot;Gruppo&quot; and the 369th &quot;Squadriglia&quot;.

When Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940, 144 C.200s were operational, only half of which were serviceable. The re-equipment programme, under which the type would have been widely adopted, took longer than expected; and several squadrons were still in the process of being reequipped with the C.200 at the outbreak of war. Although the first 240 aircraft had been fitted with fully enclosed cockpits, the subsequent variants were provided with open cockpits at the request of the Italian pilots, who were familiar with the open cockpits that were commonplace amongst the old biplanes.

===Service history===
The C.200 played no role in Italy&#x27;s brief action during the Battle of France. The first C.200s to make their combat debut were those of the 6th &quot;Gruppo Autonomo&quot; C.T. (&quot;caccia terrestre&quot;, or land-attack fighter) led by &quot;Tenente Colonnello&quot; (Wing Commander) Armando Francois. This squadron was based at the Sicilian airport of Catania Fontanarossa. A &quot;Saetta&quot; from this unit was the first C.200 to be lost in combat when, on 23 June 1940, 14 C.200s (eight from 88a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, five from 79a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; and one from 81a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;) that were escorting 10 Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s from the 11th &quot;Stormo&quot; were intercepted by two Gloster Gladiators. Gladiator No.5519, piloted by Flight Lieutenant George Burges, jumped the bombers but was in turn attacked by a C.200 flown by &quot;Sergente Maggiore&quot; Lamberto Molinelli of 71a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; over the sea off Sliema. The Macchi overshot four or five times the more agile Gladiator which eventually shot down the &quot;Saetta&quot;.

In September 1940, the C.200s of the 6th Gruppo conducted their first offensive operations in support of wider Axis efforts against the Mediterranean island of Malta, escorting Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombers. On 1 November 1940 the C.200s were credited with their first kill, a British Sunderland, on a reconnaissance mission, that was sighted and attacked just outside Augusta by a flight of &quot;Saettas&quot; on patrol. With the arrival towards the end of December 1940 of X &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; in Sicily, the C.200s were assigned escort duty for I/StG.1 and II/StG.2 Ju 87 bombers attacking Malta, as the &quot;Stukas&quot; did not have adequate fighter cover until the arrival of 7./JG26&#x27;s Bf 109s.

Soon after, British air power in the theatre was enhanced, especially by the arrival of the Hawker Hurricane fighter, which forced a redeployment of Italian forces in response. Although considered to be inferior to the Hurricane in terms of speed, the C.200 had the advantage in terms of manoeuvrability, turn radius, and climb rate. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, the C.200 proved effective against the Hurricane, delivering outstanding dogfight performance without any vices.

While the Hurricane was faster at sea level ( vs the C.200&#x27;s , the &quot;Saetta&quot; could reach more than at , although its speed dropped off at altitude: at and at with a maximum ceiling of . Comparative speeds of the Hurricane Mk I were at and at . Over and at very low levels, only the huge Vokes (anti-sand) air filter fitted to the &quot;tropical&quot; variants slowed the Hurricane Mk II to Macchi levels. Although the Macchi C.200 was more agile than the Hurricane, it carried a lighter armament than its British adversary.

On 6 February 1941, the 4th &quot;Stormo&quot; received C.200s from the 54th &quot;Stormo&quot;. Once the autorotation problems had been resolved, the Macchis were regarded as &quot;very good machines, fast, manoeuvrable and strong&quot; by Italian pilots. After intense training, on 1 April 1941, the 10th &quot;Gruppo&quot; (4th &quot;Stormo&quot;) moved to Ronchi dei Legionari airport and started active service. The C.200 subsequently saw action over Greece, Yugoslavia and the Balkans, frequently engaging in dogfights with British Gladiators and Hurricanes over the Balkans.

C.200s from the 4th &quot;Stormo&quot; took part in operations against Yugoslavia right from the start of hostilities. At dawn on 6 April 1941, four C.200s from 73a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; flew over Pola harbour and attacked an oil tanker, setting it on fire. Due to limited air resistance being encountered, sorties flown by the type in this theatre were usually limited to escorting and strafing.

The 4th &quot;Stormo&quot; flew its last mission against Yugoslavia on 14 April 1941: on that day, 20 C.200s from the 10th &quot;Gruppo&quot; flew up to south of Karlovac without meeting any enemy aircraft. Operations ended on 17 April. During those 11 days, the 4th &quot;Stormo&quot; did not lose a single C.200. Its pilots destroyed a total of 20 seaplanes and flying boats, while damaging a further 10. Additionally, they set on fire an oil tanker, a fuel truck, several other vehicles, and destroyed port installations.

===North Africa===
Fitted with dust filters and designated &quot;C.200AS&quot;, the &quot;Saetta&quot; saw extensive use in North Africa, greater than any other theatre of war. The Macchi&#x27;s introduction was not initially well received by pilots; in 1940, the first C.200 unit, the 4th &quot;Stormo&quot;, replaced the type with the C.R.42. The first combat missions were flown as escorts for Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers attacking Malta in June 1940, where one C.200 was claimed by a Gladiator. On 11 June 1940, second day of war for Italy, the C.200s of 79a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; encountered one of the Sea Gladiators that had been scrambled from Hal Far, Malta. Flying Officer W. J. Wood claimed &quot;Tenente&quot; Giuseppe Pesola had been shot down, but the Italian pilot came back unscathed to his base.

During April 1941, the C.200s of the 374th &quot;Squadriglia&quot; became the first unit to be stationed on the North African mainland. Further units, including the 153rd &quot;Gruppo&quot; and the 157th &quot;Gruppo&quot;, were stationed on the mainland as Allied air power in the region increased in capability and numbers, including aircraft such as the Hurricane and the P-40 Warhawk. According to Cattaneo, the C.200 performed well under the conditions of the desert climate, particularly due to its high structural strength and short takeoff run.

On 8 December 1941, Macchi C.200s of the 153rd &quot;Gruppo&quot; engaged Hurricanes from 94 Squadron. A dogfight developed, with the commanding officer, Squadron Leader Linnard, attempting to intercept a Macchi attacking a Hurricane. Both aircraft were making steep turns and losing height. But Linnard was too late, and the Macchi, turning inside the Hurricane, had already hit the Hurricane&#x27;s cockpit area. The stricken aircraft turned over at a low level and dived into the ground, bursting into flames. Its pilot, the New Zealand-born RAF &quot;ace&quot; (six enemy aircraft destroyed and many more probably destroyed) Flight Lieutenant Owen Tracey was killed.

North African and Italian-based units were routinely rotated to relieve war-weary crews, aiding the resumption of an Axis offensive in the region during early 1942. During this offensive, which led to Italian and German forces reaching the outskirts of Alexandria, Egypt, the C.200s were heavily engaged in bomber escort and low-altitude attack operations, while the newer C.202s performed high-altitude air cover duties.

In addition to interceptor duties, C.200s frequently operated as fighter-bombers against both land and naval objectives. The North African theatre was the first in which the type had been intentionally deployed as a fighter-bomber. During September 1942, the type was responsible for sinking the British destroyer , as well as several smaller motor vessels, near Tobruk, during Operation Agreement, an attempted amphibious assault by Allied forces.

Following the decisive victory by Commonwealth forces at El Alamein, the C.200 provided cover for the retreating Axis forces, strafing advancing Allied columns and light vehicles. However, operations by the type in the theatre were curtailed around this time by increasing shortages of spares, fuel, and components; losses in the face of numerically superior Allied air power also played a role in the rapid decline of deployable C.200s. During January 1943, many Italian aerial units were withdrawn from North Africa, leaving only a single unit operating the type. Bomb-carrying C.200s were amongst those aircraft used during Axis attempts to resist the Allied occupation of the island of Pantelleria. However, early 1943 marked the end of the C.200&#x27;s viability as an effective front-line fighter.

===Eastern Front===
In August 1941, the Italian air force command dispatched a single air corps, formed from the &quot;22º Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre&quot; with four squadrons and 51 C.200s to the Eastern Front with the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia; it was the first contribution of the Regia Aeronautica to the campaign. By 12 August 1941, all 51 C.200s had arrived at Tudora, Ștefan Vodă, near Odessa. On 13 August 1941, commanded by &quot;Maggiore&quot; Giovanni Borzoni and deployed in 359a, 362a, 369a, and 371a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; (Flights). On 27 August 1941, C.200s carried out their first operations from Krivoi Rog, achieving eight aerial victories over Soviet bombers and fighters.
For a short time, the 22nd &quot;Gruppo&quot; was subordinated to Luftwaffe V. Fliegerkorps.
Subsequently, they took part in the September offensive on the Dnieper; and as the offensive continued they operated sporadically from airstrips in Zaporozhye, Stalino, Borvenkovo, Voroshilovgrad, Makiivka, Oblivskaja, Millerovo, and their easternmost location, Kantemirovka, moving to Zaporozhye late in October 1941.

Maintaining operations became increasingly difficult as winter took hold, the unit having not been furnished with the necessary equipment for conducting low-temperature operations; accordingly, flying was often impossible throughout November and December. In December 1941, 371a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; was transferred to Stalino, but were replaced two days later by 359a with 11 C.200s. On 25 December, the C.200s flew low-level attacks against Soviet troops that had encircled the Black Shirt Legion &quot;Tagliamento&quot;, at Novo Orlowka; and 359a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; intercepted Soviet fighters over Bulawa, shooting down five without loss to themselves. On 28 December, pilots of 359a claimed nine Soviet aircraft, including six Polikarpov I-16 fighters, in the Timofeyevka and Polskaya area, without loss. According to Cattaneo, during the course of the three-day long &#x27;Christmas battle&#x27;, a total of 12 Soviet fighters were downed by C.200s with only a single friendly aircraft lost.

During February 1942, weather conditions had improved enough to allow for the resumption of full operations. From February onwards, the C.200 was employed in repeated attacks upon Soviet airfields at Liman, Luskotova, and Leninski Bomdardir. On 4 May 1942, the 22º &quot;Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre&quot; was withdrawn from active operation. The unit had flown 68 missions, taking part in 19 air combats and 11 ground attack missions. The 22º &quot;Gruppo&quot; was credited with 66 enemy destroyed, 16 probables, and 45 damaged and was awarded a &quot;Medaglia d&#x27;argento al valor militare&quot; (Silver Medal for military valor). The group was replaced by the newly formed 21º &quot;Gruppo Autonomo Caccia Terrestre&quot;, composed of 356a, 361a, 382a, and 386a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;. This unit, commanded by &quot;Maggiore&quot; Ettore Foschini, brought new C.202s and 18 new C.200 fighters. During the Second Battle of Kharkov (12–30 May) the Italians flew escort for the German bombers and reconnaissance aircraft.

In May, the aircraft&#x27;s pilots received praise from the commander of the German 17th Army, mostly for their daring and effective attacks in the Slavyansk area. During the German advance in summer 1942, the 21st &quot;Gruppo Autonomo C.T.&quot; transferred to Makiivka airfield, and then to Voroshilovgrad and Oblivskaya.

As time went on, the type was increasingly tasked to escort German aircraft. On 24 July 1942, the unit was shifted to Tatsinskaya Airfield, with 24 &quot;Saettas&quot;. Its main task was to provide escort for Stukas in the Don Bend area, where there were few German fighters available. &quot;Hauptmann&quot; Friedrich Lang, &quot;Staffelkäpitan&quot; of 1./&quot;StG&quot; 2 reported the Italian escort as &quot;most disappointing&quot;. The Saettas proved unable to protect the Stukas from Soviet fighters. On 25 and 26 July 1942, five C.200s were lost in aerial combat. After only three days of action from Tatsinskaya, one-third of the Italian fighters had been shot down.

The following winter, the Soviet counter-offensive resulted in the mass retreat of Axis forces. By early-December 1942, only 32 &quot;Saettas&quot; were still operating, along with 11 C.202s. However, during the first 18 months of its use on the Eastern front, together with C.202s, the C.200 had claimed an 88 to 15 victory/loss ratio, during which it had performed 1,983 escort missions, 2,557 offensive sweeps, 511 ground support sorties, and 1,310 strafing sorties.

Losses grew in the face of a more aggressive enemy flying newer aircraft. The last major action was on 17 January 1943: 25 C.200s strafed enemy troops in the Millerovo area. The aviation of the ARMIR was withdrawn on 18 January, bringing 30 C.200 and nine C.202 fighters back to Italy and leaving 15 unserviceable aircraft behind. A total of 66 Italian aircraft had been lost on the Eastern Front – against, according to official figures, 88 victories claimed during 17 months of action in that theatre.

A summary of the Italian expeditionary force operations included 2,557 offensive flights (of which 511 with bombs drops), 1,310 strafing attacks, and 1,938 escort missions, with the loss of 15 C.200s overall. The top-scoring unit was 362a &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, commanded by &quot;Capitano&quot; Germano La Ferla, which claimed 30 Soviet aircraft shot down and 13 destroyed on the ground.

===After the armistice===
Following the signing of the armistice, which resulted in Italy&#x27;s withdrawal from the Axis, only 33 C.200s remained serviceable. Shortly thereafter, 23 &quot;Saettas&quot; were transferred to Allied airfields in southern Italy, and flown for a short time by pilots of the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force. In mid-1944, the C.200s of Southern Italy were transferred to the Leverano Fighter School. A lack of spare parts had made maintenance increasingly difficult, but the type continued to be used for advanced training until 1947. A small number of C.200s were also flown by the pro-German National Republican Air Force, based in northern Italy. The latter was only recorded as using the type for a training aircraft but using them for combat operations.

==Variants==
The &quot;Saetta&quot; underwent very few modifications during its service life. Aside from the switch to an open canopy, later aircraft were fitted with an upgraded radio and an armoured seat. Some late-production &quot;Saettas&quot; were built with the MC.202 &quot;Serie&quot; VII wing, thus adding two Breda-SAFAT machine guns to the armament. The four (including two proposed) C.200 derivatives were:
;M.C. 200 (prototypes)
:Two prototypes fitted with the Fiat A.74 R.C.38 radial piston engine.
;M.C. 200
:Single-seat interceptor fighter, fighter-bomber aircraft. Production version.
;M.C.200bis
:Breda-proposed modification with a Piaggio P.XIX R.C.45 engine producing at . Converted from an early production C.200. First flight 11 April 1942 from Milano-Bresso, flown by Luigi Acerbi. The aircraft was then fitted with a larger propeller and a revised engine cowling. Top speed in trials was . It did not enter production, as the C.200 had been replaced by more advanced designs.
;M.C.200AS
:Version adapted to North African Campaign by the fitting of dust filters. Hard points were introduced in the wing as a field modification which permitted two bombs of up to 352lb (160kg) to be caried. AS stood for Africa Settentrionale (‘North Africa’).
;M.C.200CB
:Fighter-bomber (cacciabombardiere) version with of bombs or two external fuel tanks (as fighter escort).
;M.C.201
:As an answer to a 5 January 1938 request by the Regia Aeronautica for a C.200 replacement, Aermacchi proposed the C.201, which had a revised fuselage, a fully enclosed pressurized cabin, and an Isotta Fraschini Astro A.140RC.40 engine (licensed variant of the French Gnome-Rhone Mistral Major GR.14Krs) generating 870 cv (&quot;cheval vapeur&quot;, or metric horsepower). But later the choice was for the Fiat A.76 R.C.40 engine with . Two prototypes were ordered. The first flew on 10 August 1940, with the less powerful A.74 engine. Although Macchi estimated a top speed of only 312mph was attained on test, work on the two prototypes was cancelled after Fiat abandoned the troublesome A.76 engine.

==Operators==

<doc id="176526" wikidata="Q13310" url="?curid=176526" title="Navajo language">
<text>Navajo or Navaho ( ; Navajo: or ) is a Southern Athabaskan language of the Na-Dené family, through which it is related to languages spoken across the western areas of North America. Navajo is spoken primarily in the Southwestern United States, especially in the Navajo Nation. It is one of the most widely spoken Native American languages and is the most widely spoken north of the Mexico–United States border, with almost 170,000 Americans speaking Navajo at home as of 2011.

The language has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs in the Navajo Nation. In World War II, speakers of the Navajo language joined the military and developed a code for sending secret messages. These code talkers&#x27; messages are widely credited with saving many lives and winning some of the most decisive battles in the war.

Navajo has a fairly large phonemic inventory, including several consonants that are not found in English. Its four basic vowel qualities are distinguished for nasality, length, and tone. Navajo has both agglutinative and fusional elements: it uses affixes to modify verbs, and nouns are typically created from multiple morphemes, but in both cases these morphemes are fused irregularly and beyond easy recognition. Basic word order is subject–object–verb, though it is highly flexible to pragmatic factors. Verbs are conjugated for aspect and mood, and given affixes for the person and number of both subjects and objects, as well as a host of other variables.

The language&#x27;s orthography, which was developed in the late 1930s, is based on the Latin script. Most Navajo vocabulary is Athabaskan in origin, as the language has been conservative with loanwords due to its highly complex noun morphology.

==Nomenclature==
The word &quot;Navajo&quot; is an exonym: it comes from the Tewa word , which combines the roots (&#x27;field&#x27;) and (&#x27;valley&#x27;) to mean &#x27;large field&#x27;. It was borrowed into Spanish to refer to an area of present-day northwestern New Mexico, and later into English for the Navajo tribe and their language. The alternative spelling &quot;Navaho&quot; is considered antiquated; even the anthropologist Berard Haile spelled it with a &quot;j&quot; despite his personal objections. The Navajo refer to themselves as the (&#x27;People&#x27;), with their language known as (&#x27;People&#x27;s language&#x27;) or .

==Classification==
Navajo is an Athabaskan language; Navajo and Apache languages make up the southernmost branch of the family. Most of the other Athabaskan languages are located in Alaska, northwestern Canada, and along the North American Pacific coast.

Most languages in the Athabaskan family have tones. However, this feature evolved independently in all subgroups; Proto-Athabaskan had no tones. In each case, tone evolved from glottalic consonants at the ends of morphemes; however, the progression of these consonants into tones has not been consistent, with some related morphemes being pronounced with high tones in some Athabaskan languages and low tones in others. It has been posited that Navajo and Chipewyan, which have no common ancestor more recent than Proto-Athabaskan and possess many pairs of corresponding but opposite tones, evolved from different dialects of Proto-Athabaskan that pronounced these glottalic consonants differently. Proto-Athabaskan diverged fully into separate languages .

Navajo is most closely related to Western Apache, with which it shares a similar tonal scheme and more than 92 percent of its vocabulary, and to Chiricahua-Mescalero Apache. It is estimated that the Apachean linguistic groups separated and became established as distinct societies, of which the Navajo were one, somewhere between 1300 and 1525. Navajo is generally considered mutually intelligible with all other Apachean languages.

==History==
The Apachean languages, of which Navajo is one, are thought to have arrived in the American Southwest from the north by 1500, probably passing through Alberta and Wyoming. Archaeological finds considered to be proto-Navajo have been located in the far northern New Mexico around the La Plata, Animas and Pine rivers, dating to around 1500. In 1936, linguist Edward Sapir showed how the arrival of the Navajo people in the new arid climate among the corn agriculturalists of the Pueblo area was reflected in their language by tracing the changing meanings of words from Proto-Athabaskan to Navajo. For example, the word *&quot;dè:&quot;, which in Proto-Athabaskan meant &quot;horn&quot; and &quot;dipper made from animal horn&quot;, in Navajo became a-deeʼ, which meant &quot;gourd&quot; or &quot;dipper made from gourd&quot;. Likewise, the Proto-Athabaskan word *&quot;ł-yəx̣s&quot; &quot;snow lies on the ground&quot; in Navajo became &quot;yas&quot; &quot;snow&quot;. Similarly, the Navajo word for &quot;corn&quot; is &quot;naadą́ą́ʼ&quot;, derived from two Proto-Athabaskan roots meaning &quot;enemy&quot; and &quot;food&quot;, suggesting that the Navajo originally considered corn to be &quot;food of the enemy&quot; when they first arrived among the Pueblo people.

===Navajo Code Talkers===

During World Wars I and II, the U.S. government employed speakers of the Navajo language as Navajo code talkers. These Navajo soldiers and sailors used a code based on the Navajo language to relay secret messages. At the end of the war the code remained unbroken.

The code used Navajo words for each letter of the English alphabet. Messages could be encoded and decoded by using a simple substitution cipher where the ciphertext was the Navajo word. Type two code was informal and directly translated from English into Navajo. If there was no word in Navajo to describe a military word, code talkers used descriptive words. For example, the Navajo did not have a word for &quot;submarine&quot;, so they translated it as &quot;iron fish&quot;.

These Navajo code talkers are widely recognized for their contributions to WWII. Major Howard Connor, 5th Marine Division Signal Officer stated, &quot;Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.&quot;

===Colonization===

Navajo lands were initially colonized by the Spanish in the early seventeenth century, shortly after this area was annexed as part of the Spanish viceroyalty of New Spain. When the United States annexed these territories in 1848 following the Mexican–American War, the English-speaking settlers allowed Navajo children to attend their schools. In some cases, the United States established separate schools for Navajo and other Native American children. In the late 19th century, it founded boarding schools, often operated by religious missionary groups. In efforts to acculturate the children, school authorities insisted that they learn to speak English and practice Christianity. Students routinely had their mouths washed out with lye soap as a punishment if they did speak Navajo. Consequently, when these students grew up and had children of their own, they often did not teach them Navajo, in order to prevent them from being punished.

Robert W. Young and William Morgan, who both worked for the Navajo Agency of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, developed and published a practical orthography in 1937. It helped spread education among Navajo speakers. In 1943 the men collaborated on &quot;The Navajo Language&quot;, a dictionary organized by the roots of the language. In World War II, the United States military used speakers of Navajo as code talkers—to transmit top-secret military messages over telephone and radio in a code based on Navajo. The language was considered ideal because of its grammar, which differs strongly from that of German and Japanese, and because no published Navajo dictionaries existed at the time.

By the 1960s, Indigenous languages of the United States had been declining in use for some time. Native American language use began to decline more quickly in this decade as paved roads were built and English-language radio was broadcast to tribal areas. Navajo was no exception, although its large speaker pool—larger than that of any other Native language in the United States—gave it more staying power than most. Adding to the language&#x27;s decline, federal acts passed in the 1950s to increase educational opportunities for Navajo children had resulted in pervasive use of English in their schools.

In more recent years, the number of monolingual Navajo speakers have been in the decline, and most younger Navajo people are bilingual. Near the 1990s, many Navajo children have little to no knowledge in Navajo language, only knowing English.

===Revitalization and current status===
In 1968, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Bilingual Education Act, which provided funds for educating young students who are not native English speakers. The Act had mainly been intended for Spanish-speaking children—particularly Mexican Americans—but it applied to all recognized linguistic minorities. Many Native American tribes seized the chance to establish their own bilingual education programs. However, qualified teachers who were fluent in Native languages were scarce, and these programs were largely unsuccessful.

However, data collected in 1980 showed that 85 percent of Navajo first-graders were bilingual, compared to 62 percent of Navajo of all ages—early evidence of a resurgence of use of their traditional language among younger people. In 1984, to counteract the language&#x27;s historical decline, the Navajo Nation Council decreed that the Navajo language would be available and comprehensive for students of all grade levels in schools of the Navajo Nation. This effort was aided by the fact that, largely due to the work of Young and Morgan, Navajo is one of the best-documented Native American languages. In 1980 they published a monumental expansion of their work on the language, organized by word (first initial of vowel or consonant) in the pattern of English dictionaries, as requested by Navajo students. &quot;The Navajo Language: A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary&quot; also included a 400-page grammar, making it invaluable for both native speakers and students of the language. Particularly in its organization of verbs, it was oriented to Navajo speakers. They expanded this work again in 1987, with several significant additions, and this edition continues to be used as an important text.

The Native American language education movement has been met with adversity, such as by English-only campaigns in some areas in the late 1990s. However, Navajo-immersion programs have cropped up across the Navajo Nation. Statistical evidence shows that Navajo-immersion students generally do better on standardized tests than their counterparts educated only in English. Some educators have remarked that students who know their native languages feel a sense of pride and identity validation. Since 1989, Diné College, a Navajo tribal community college, has offered an associate degree in the subject of Navajo. This program includes language, literature, culture, medical terminology, and teaching courses and produces the highest number of Navajo teachers of any institution in the United States. About 600 students attend per semester. One major university that teaches classes in the Navajo language is Arizona State University. In 1992, Young and Morgan published another major work on Navajo: &quot;Analytical Lexicon of Navajo&quot;, with the assistance of Sally Midgette (Navajo). This work is organized by root, the basis of Athabaskan languages.

A 1991 survey of 682 preschoolers on the Navajo Reservation Head Start program found that 54 percent were monolingual English speakers, 28 percent were bilingual in English and Navajo, and 18 percent spoke only Navajo. This study noted that while the preschool staff knew both languages, they spoke English to the children most of the time. In addition, most of the children&#x27;s parents spoke to the children in English more often than in Navajo. The study concluded that the preschoolers were in &quot;almost total immersion in English&quot;. An American Community Survey taken in 2011 found that 169,369 Americans spoke Navajo at home—0.3 percent of Americans whose primary home language was not English. Of primary Navajo speakers, 78.8 percent reported they spoke English &quot;very well&quot;, a fairly high percentage overall but less than among other Americans speaking a different Native American language (85.4 percent). Navajo was the only Native American language afforded its own category in the survey; domestic Navajo speakers represented 46.4 percent of all domestic Native language speakers (only 195,407 Americans have a different home Native language). As of July 2014, Ethnologue classes Navajo as &quot;6b&quot; (In Trouble), signifying that few, but some, parents teach the language to their offspring and that concerted efforts at revitalization could easily protect the language. Navajo had a high population for a language in this category. About half of all Navajo people live on Navajo Nation land, an area spanning parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah; others are dispersed throughout the United States. Under tribal law, fluency in Navajo is mandatory for candidates to the office of the President of the Navajo Nation.

Both original and translated media have been produced in Navajo. The first works tended to be religious texts translated by missionaries, including the Bible. From 1943 to about 1957, the Navajo Agency of the BIA published &quot;Ádahooníłígíí&quot; (&quot;Events&quot;), the first newspaper in Navajo and the only one to be written entirely in Navajo. It was edited by Robert W. Young and William Morgan, Sr. (Navajo). They had collaborated on &quot;The Navajo Language&quot;, a major language dictionary published that same year, and continued to work on studying and documenting the language in major works for the next few decades. Today an AM radio station, KTNN, broadcasts in Navajo and English, with programming including music and NFL games; AM station KNDN broadcasts only in Navajo. When Super Bowl XXX was broadcast in Navajo in 1996, it was the first time a Super Bowl had been carried in a Native American language. In 2013, the 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; was translated into Navajo. It was the first major motion picture translated into any Native American language.

On October 5, 2018, an early beta of a Navajo course was released on Duolingo, a popular language learning app.

On December 30, 2024, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, made Navajo language, the official language of Navajo Nation by signing legislation. He said “One of my priorities coming in as President has always been to make sure that we make Navajo cool again.” This is in order to promote the intergenerational preservation of the Navajo language within the Navajo Nation and intending to work in conjunction with the Diné Language Teachers Association to foster the utilization of the Navajo language.

===Education===
The Navajo Nation operates Tséhootsooí Diné Bi&#x27;ólta&#x27;, a Navajo language immersion school for grades K-8 in Fort Defiance, Arizona. Located on the Arizona-New Mexico border in the southeastern quarter of the Navajo Reservation, the school strives to revitalize Navajo among children of the Window Rock Unified School District. Tséhootsooí Diné Bi&#x27;ólta&#x27; has thirteen Navajo language teachers who instruct only in the Navajo language, and no English, while five English language teachers instruct in the English language. Kindergarten and first grade are taught completely in the Navajo language, while English is incorporated into the program during third grade, when it is used for about 10% of instruction. In the 2020s, the language nest Saad K’ildyé was established near Albuquerque through a non-profit Diné-led organization. The school also offers classes to parents and family activities revolving around Diné culture.

After many Navajo schools were closed during World War II, a program aiming to provide education to Navajo children was funded in the 1950s, where the number of students quickly doubled in the next decade. According to the Navajo Nation Education Policies, the Navajo Tribal Council requests that schools teach both English and Navajo so that the children would remain bilingual, though their influence over the school systems was very low. A small number of preschool programs provide a Navajo-language immersion curriculum, which teaches children basic Navajo vocabulary and grammar under the assumption that they have no prior knowledge in the Navajo language.

==Phonology==

Navajo has a fairly large consonant inventory. Its stop consonants exist in three laryngeal forms: aspirated, unaspirated, and ejective—for example, , , and . Ejective consonants are those that are pronounced with a glottalic initiation. Navajo also has a simple glottal stop used after vowels, and every word that would otherwise begin with a vowel is pronounced with an initial glottal stop. Consonant clusters are uncommon, aside from frequent placing or before fricatives.

The language has four vowel qualities: , , , and . Each exists in both oral and nasalized forms, and can be either short or long. Navajo also distinguishes for tone between high and low, with the low tone typically regarded as the default. However, some linguists have suggested that Navajo does not possess true tones, but only a pitch accent system similar to that of Japanese. In general, Navajo speech also has a slower speech tempo than English does.


== Grammar ==
===Typology===
Navajo is difficult to classify in terms of broad morphological typology: it relies heavily on affixes—mainly prefixes—like agglutinative languages, but these affixes are joined in unpredictable, overlapping ways that make them difficult to segment, a trait of fusional languages. In general, Navajo verbs contain more morphemes than nouns do (on average, 11 for verbs compared to 4–5 for nouns), but noun morphology is less transparent. Depending on the source, Navajo is either classified as a fusional agglutinative or even polysynthetic language, as it shows mechanisms from all three.

In terms of basic word order, Navajo has been classified as a subject–object–verb language. However, some speakers order the subject and object based on &quot;noun ranking&quot;. In this system, nouns are ranked in three categories—humans, animals, and inanimate objects—and within these categories, nouns are ranked by strength, size, and intelligence. Whichever of the subject and object has a higher rank comes first. As a result, the agent of an action may be syntactically ambiguous. The highest rank position is held by humans and lightning. Other linguists such as Eloise Jelinek consider Navajo to be a discourse configurational language, in which word order is not fixed by syntactic rules, but determined by pragmatic factors in the communicative context.

===Verbs===
In Navajo, verbs are the main elements of their sentences, imparting a large amount of information. The verb is based on a stem, which is made of a root to identify the action and the semblance of a suffix to convey mode and aspect; however, this suffix is fused beyond separability. The stem is given somewhat more transparent prefixes to indicate, in this order, the following information: postpositional object, postposition, adverb-state, iterativity, number, direct object, deictic information, another adverb-state, mode and aspect, subject, classifier (see later on), mirativity and two-tier evidentiality. Some of these prefixes may be null; for example, there is only a plural marker (&quot;da/daa&quot;) and no readily identifiable marker for the other grammatical numbers.

Navajo does not distinguish strict tense per se; instead, an action&#x27;s position in time is conveyed through mode, aspect, but also via time adverbials or context. Each verb has an inherent aspect and can be conjugated in up to seven modes.

For any verb, the usitative and iterative modes share the same stem, as do the progressive and future modes; these modes are distinguished with prefixes. However, pairs of modes other than these may also share the same stem, as illustrated in the following example, where the verb &quot;to play&quot; is conjugated into each of the five mode paradigms:

* Imperfective: &quot;-né&quot; – is playing, was playing, will be playing
* Perfective: &quot;-neʼ&quot; – played, had played, will have played
* Progressive/future: &quot;-neeł&quot; – is playing along / will play, will be playing
* Usitative/iterative: &quot;-neeh&quot; – usually plays, frequently plays, repeatedly plays
* Optative: &quot;-neʼ&quot; – would play, may play

The basic set of subject prefixes for the imperfective mode, as well as the actual conjugation of the verb into these person and number categories, are as follows.


The remaining piece of these conjugated verbs—the prefix &quot;na-&quot;—is called an &quot;outer&quot; or &quot;disjunct&quot; prefix. It is the marker of the Continuative aspect (to play about).

Navajo distinguishes between the first, second, third, and fourth persons in the singular, dual, and plural numbers. The fourth person is similar to the third person, but is generally used for indefinite, theoretical actors rather than defined ones. Despite the potential for extreme verb complexity, only the mode/aspect, subject, classifier, and stem are absolutely necessary. Furthermore, Navajo negates clauses by surrounding the verb with the circumclitic &quot;doo= ... =da&quot; (e.g. &quot;mósí doo nitsaa da&quot; &#x27;the cat is not big&#x27;). &quot;Dooda&quot;, as a single word, corresponds to English &quot;no&quot;.

===Nouns===
Nouns are not required to form a complete Navajo sentence. Besides the extensive information that can be communicated with a verb, Navajo speakers may alternate between the third and fourth person to distinguish between two already specified actors, similarly to how speakers of languages with grammatical gender may repeatedly use pronouns.

Most nouns are not inflected for number, and plurality is usually encoded directly in the verb through the use of various prefixes or aspects, though this is by no means mandatory. In the following example, the verb on the right is used with the plural prefix and switches to the distributive aspect.

Some verbal roots encode number in their lexical definition (see classificatory verbs above). When available, the use of the correct verbal root is mandatory:



Number marking on nouns occurs only for terms of kinship and age-sex groupings. Other prefixes that can be added to nouns include possessive markers (e.g., – ) and a few adjectival enclitics. Generally, an upper limit for prefixes on a noun is about four or five.

Nouns are also not marked for case, this traditionally being covered by word order.

==Vocabulary==
The vast majority of Navajo vocabulary is of Athabaskan origin. The number of lexical roots is still fairly small; one estimate counted 6,245 noun bases and 9,000 verb bases (with most nouns being derived from verbs), but those are combined with the numerous affixes in a myriad of ways so that words rarely consist of a single stem like English. Prior to the European colonization of the Americas, Navajo did not borrow much from other languages, including from other Athabaskan and even Apachean languages. The Athabaskan family is fairly diverse in both phonology and morphology due to its languages&#x27; prolonged relative isolation. Even the Pueblo peoples, with whom the Navajo interacted with for centuries and borrowed cultural customs, have lent few words to the Navajo language. After Spain and Mexico took over Navajo lands, the language did not incorporate many Spanish words, either.

This resistance to word absorption extended to English, at least until the mid-twentieth century. Around this point, the Navajo language began importing some, though still not many, English words, mainly by young schoolchildren exposed to English.

Navajo has expanded its vocabulary to include Western technological and cultural terms through calques and Navajo descriptive terms. For example, the phrase for English &quot;tank&quot; is &#x27;vehicle that crawls around, by means of which big explosions are made, and that one sits on at an elevation&#x27;. This language purism also extends to proper nouns, such as the names of U.S. states (e.g. &quot;Hoozdo&quot; &#x27;Arizona&#x27; and &quot;Yootó&quot; &#x27;New Mexico&#x27;; see also &quot;hahoodzo&quot; &#x27;state&#x27;) and languages (&quot;naakaii&quot; &#x27;Spanish&#x27;).

Only one Navajo word has been fully absorbed into the English language: &quot;hogan&quot; (from Navajo &quot;hooghan&quot;) – a term referring to the traditional houses. Another word with limited English recognition is &quot;chindi&quot; (an evil spirit of the deceased). The taxonomic genus name &quot;Uta&quot; may be of Navajo origin. It has been speculated that English-speaking settlers were reluctant to take on more Navajo loanwords compared to many other Native American languages, including the Hopi language, because the Navajo were among the most violent resisters to colonialism.

==Orthography==
Early attempts at a Navajo orthography were made in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One such attempt was based on the Latin alphabet, particularly the English variety, with some additional letters and diacritics. Anthropologists were frustrated by Navajo&#x27;s having several sounds that are not found in English and lack of other sounds that are. Finally, the current Navajo orthography was developed between 1935 and 1940 by Young and Morgan.

An apostrophe (ʼ) is used to mark ejective consonants (e.g. &quot;chʼ&quot;, &quot;tłʼ&quot;) as well as mid-word or final glottal stops. However, initial glottal stops are usually not marked.

The voiceless glottal fricative () is normally written as &quot;h&quot;, but appears as &quot;x&quot; after the consonant &quot;s&quot; (optionally after &quot;sh&quot;) at syllable boundary (ex: ), and when it represents the depreciative augment found after stem initial (ex: , ). The voiced velar fricative is written as &quot;y&quot; before &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot; (where it is palatalized ), as &quot;w&quot; before &quot;o&quot; (where it is labialized ), and as &quot;gh&quot; before &quot;a&quot;.

Navajo represents nasalized vowels with an ogonek ( ˛ ), sometimes described as a reverse cedilla; and represents the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative () with a barred &quot;L&quot; (capital &quot;Ł&quot;, lowercase &quot;ł&quot;). The ogonek is most often placed centrally under a vowel, but it was imported from Polish and Lithuanian, which do not usually center it nor use it under certain vowels such as &quot;o&quot; or any vowels with accent marks. For example, in Navajo works, the ogonek below lowercase &quot;a&quot; is most often shown centered below the letter, whereas fonts with &quot;a&quot; with ogonek intended for Polish and Lithuanian have its ogonek connected to the bottom right of the letter. Very few Unicode fonts display the ogonek differently in Navajo with language tagging than in Polish or Lithuanian.

The first Navajo-capable typewriter was developed in preparation for a Navajo newspaper and dictionary created in the 1940s. The advent of early computers in the 1960s necessitated special fonts to input Navajo text, and the first Navajo font was created in the 1970s. Navajo virtual keyboards were made available for iOS devices in November 2012 and Android devices in August 2013.

==Sample text==
This is the first paragraph of a Navajo short story.

Navajo original: 

English translation: Some crazy boys decided to make some wine to sell, so they each planted grapevines and, working hard on them, they raised them to maturity. Then, having made wine, they each filled a goatskin with it. They agreed that at no time would they give each other a drink of it, and they then set out for town lugging the goatskins on their backs (...)

<text>The Macchi C.202 &quot;Folgore&quot; (Italian &quot;thunderbolt&quot;) is an Italian fighter aircraft developed and manufactured by Macchi Aeronautica. It was operated mainly by the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (&quot;RA&quot;; Royal (Italian) Air Force) in and around the Second World War. According to aviation author David Mondey, the &quot;Folgore&quot; has been considered to be one of the best wartime fighters to serve in large numbers with the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;.

The C.202 was designed by a team headed by the company&#x27;s chief of design, Italian aeronautics engineer Mario Castoldi. As per company tradition, Macchi aircraft designed by Mario Castoldi received the &quot;C&quot; letter in their model designation, hence the &quot;Folgore&quot; is commonly referred to as the C.202 or MC.202. The C.202 was a development of the earlier C.200 &quot;Saetta&quot;, powered by an Italian-built version of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa engine and featuring a redesigned fuselage for greater .

During July 1941, the &quot;Folgore&quot; went into service with the &quot;Regia Aeronautica.&quot; In combat, it very quickly proved itself to be an effective and deadly dogfighter against its contemporaries. During its service life, the C.202 was deployed on all fronts in which Italy was involved. During late 1941, it commenced offensive operations over Malta and in North Africa, where Italian and German forces were engaged in heavy combat against British and later American operations. The C.202 continued to be used in North Africa as late as mid-1943, by which point the type was withdrawn to support defensive efforts in Sicily and the Italian mainland following their invasion by Allied forces. It also saw limited use on the Eastern Front. Following the 1943 Armistice with Italy, the type was mostly used as a trainer aircraft. It was also operated by Croatia.

The Macchi C.202 was flown by almost all of the most successful Italian aces. During mid-1942, in North Africa, the &quot;Folgore&quot; achieved a ratio kill/loss better than that of the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The Australian ace Clive Caldwell, who fought a wide variety of German, Italian and Japanese fighters during 1941–45, later stated that the C.202 was &quot;one of the best and most undervalued of fighters&quot;. The type also had well-known design flaws: in particular, like the C.200, the C.202 was prone to suddenly entering dangerous spins. Its radios were also unreliable, routinely forcing pilots to communicate by waggling their wings. The C.202 was lightly armed relative to its contemporaries, with just a pair of machine guns that had a tendency for jamming. To improve its performance it was developed into its successor: the Macchi C.205 Veltro.

==Development==
===Origin===

During the 1930s, the Italian military authorities chose to adopt only radial engines to power their aircraft; consequently, during the second half of the 1930s, the Italian aeronautical industry had been sufficiently de-incentivised to the point of completely avoiding the development of more powerful engines based on streamlined liquid-cooled designs, which would become popular abroad. As a result of this preference, Italian aircraft manufacturer Macchi Aeronautica was forced to rely on the aging Fiat A.74 radial to power its C.200 fighter. However, by 1941, the C.200, which was armed with a pair of 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine guns and capable of a maximum speed of 504 km/h (315 mph), was considered to be obsolete in comparison to competitors in production overseas.

During July 1939, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; requested that Reggiane construct a single prototype Re.2000 that was powered by a German Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa, liquid-cooled supercharged inverted V-12 engine rated at 1,175 PS (1,159 hp, 864 kW); this became the Re.2001. At the time, the most powerful reliable Italian inline engine was the 715 kW (960 hp) Isotta Fraschini Asso XI R.C.40, which was designed in 1936. During November 1939, the Italian automotive company Alfa Romeo acquired a license to produce the DB 601Aa as the Alfa Romeo RA.1000 R.C.41-I &quot;Monsone&quot;; it was this engine that was to be used in the production of the C.202.

While waiting for domestic production of the engine by Alfa Romeo to ramp up, Aeronautica Macchi decided to import a single DB 601Aa engine; this was initially performed as a private venture without any state support. Macchi chief of design Mario Castoldi commenced work on mating the Macchi C.200 wings, undercarriage, vertical and horizontal tail units to a new fuselage that incorporated the imported DB 601Aa. During January 1940, formal design work on the new fighter commenced and, shortly thereafter, construction began on a single prototype of the design. Castoldi, whose background included working on Schneider Trophy racers design, followed Celestino Rosatelli as the main designer of new fighters for the &quot;RA&quot;. His new project was robust and small, utilizing a conventional but complex structural arrangement based on his experience with wooden designs, and at the same time paying great attention to its aerodynamics (Castoldi had previously designed the MC.72, the world&#x27;s fastest aircraft of its time).

===Flight testing===
On 10 August 1940, less than seven months following the start of design work and two months after Italy&#x27;s entry into the Second World War, the sole prototype conducted its maiden flight. The prototype differed in some respects from the production aircraft; the headrest fairing incorporated two windows for rear visibility, while production versions replaced this with a narrower, scalloped headrest. The square-sectioned supercharger air intake was replaced by an elongated round sectioned fairing, which was later redesigned to incorporate a dust filter. From the onset of flying trials, it was evident that the C.202 was an advanced design for the era, owing much of its performance to the use of the Daimler Benz DB 601, which represented a departure from the standard practice of using engines of Italian origin.
Following its initial flights, the prototype was flown to the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;″s main test airfield at Guidonia, where it reportedly met with an enthusiastic response from test pilots. A speed of 603 km/h (375 mph) was recorded during testing, while an altitude of 5,486 m (18,000 ft) was attained within the space of six minutes; in addition, little of the favourable manoeuvrability of the earlier C.200 had been lost. Another of its positive attributes was its extremely strong construction, which allowed its pilots to dive the aircraft steeply. The performance figures gathered during these tests indicated that Italy had caught up with both Britain and Germany in the field of fighter airplanes.

===Production constraints===
As a result of the favourable flight test reports, the C.202 was immediately ordered into production; the first examples (built by Macchi as Serie II) appearing in May 1941. However, the complexity of the structure was not well suited to mass production, and resulted in a relatively limited production rate. According to aviation author Giuseppe Ciampaglia, in comparison to the Bf 109E/F, which was rated at typically requiring 4,500–6,000 man-hours per aircraft to complete, the Macchi routinely needed in excess of 22,000 man-hours. The growth of the C.202 project was slower than that of the rival Re. 2001 effort; but, by employing both mass production techniques and less expensive advanced technologies, the production cost was slightly less than that of the Reggiane Re.2001, (525,000 lire vs 600,000); this latter, the only other DB 601 fighter in mass production, was slower and heavier (2.460/3.240 kg) but had a bigger wing and a more advanced and adaptable structure.

In order to expand production, the Milan-based industrial manufacturer Società Italiana Ernesto Breda was selected to also construct the C.202. Breda would eventually produce the majority of the type. SAI-Ambrosini, based in Passignano sul Trasimeno, also served as another sub-contractor on the C.202, ultimately building around 100 fighters of the type. For some time, supplies of the DB 601 engine continued to be provided directly from Germany in order to supplement Italian production. Throughout the type&#x27;s production life, manufacturing was near-permanently constrained by the limited availability of the engine.

==Design==

The Macchi C.202 &quot;Folgore&quot; was developed from the earlier C.200 &quot;Saetta&quot;, the principal differences being the use of an Italian-built version of the German Daimler-Benz DB 601Aa engine and the adoption of a revised fuselage. Both the wing and fuselage structures were metal, with a single vertical tail, and a wing of relatively conventional design with two main spars and 23 ribs. The ailerons, elevators and rudder were metal structures with fabric covering. The trailing edge of the wing inboard of the ailerons was occupied by a pair of all metal split flaps. The undercarriage had two widely set hydraulically-actuated main legs retracting inwards into recesses in the wing; the tail wheel was non-retractable.

The fuselage of the C.202 was a semi-monocoque structure, comprising four light-alloy longerons and ovoidal formers. It was significantly better streamlined than the preceding C.200 to increase performance by reducing parasitic drag. The forward section housed both the main armament and the Alfa Romeo RA.1000 R.C.41-I Monsone engine, which drove a Piaggio P1001 three-blade, variable pitch, constant speed propeller. As with the C.200, to counteract the torque of the engine Castoldi extended the left wing by 21 cm (8.5 inches) so that the left wing developed more lift, offsetting the tendency of the aircraft to roll to the left due to the rotation of the propeller. The wing was a two spar structure, attached to the fuselage center section via steel forgings; it was fitted with flaps that were both statically and dynamically balanced.

The main coolant radiator was housed in a rectangular fairing under the fuselage beneath the cockpit, and the oil cooler was placed under the nose within a streamlined, rectangular housing. From the cockpit aft, the fuselage was formed into a round monocoque structure; the aft fuselage tapered into the tail and contained the radio, oxygen and flight control mechanisms. The canopy was hinged on the starboard base and opened sideways. Behind the canopy, the pilot&#x27;s headrest was fixed to a triangular turn-over pylon which was covered by a streamlined, tapered fairing. This fairing was shaped into an inverted &#x27;T&#x27; which enabled the pilot to have a reasonable field of view to the rear. The unpressurised cockpit had an armor plate fitted behind the armored seat for protection. While early C.202s had a very short &quot;stub&quot; radio mast projecting from the fairing, most used a tall, slim mast.

Situated behind the engine and under the 12.7 mm (.5 in) ammunition boxes there was a single 270 L (71.3 US gal) fuel tank; all tanks were of the self-sealing variety. Another 80 L (21.1 US gal) fuel tank was placed behind the pilot, along with a pair of additional tanks, each with a capacity of 40 L (10.5 US gal), being housed in the wing roots; the total fuel capacity was 430 L (113.6 US gal). Jettisonable tanks, containing either 22 or 33 gallons of fuel, could be installed upon some of the later built aircraft.
Initially, all the armament was fitted within the nose of the Macchi. Ammunition carried was up to 800 rounds (standard: 700 rounds). An additional pair of Breda 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns was fitted in the wings in the VII series onward, but these, along with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, added 100 kg (220 lb) to the aircraft&#x27;s weight and were typically removed by pilots to save weight, since they were relatively ineffective against most enemy aircraft in 1942. A synchronizing unit allowed the nose guns to fire through the propeller disk, but with a 25% loss in rate of fire. A &quot;San Giorgio&quot; reflector gun sight was fitted.

Australian air ace Clive Caldwell felt the &quot;Folgore&quot; would have been superior to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 had it been better armed. The C.202 was lightly armed by the standards of the time carrying the same armament as the C.R.32, a 1933 design. The C.202 carried as standard two 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns. The Breda design was as heavy as the Browning M2, the model from which it was derived. The Breda fired 12.7x81 mm &quot;Vickers&quot; ammunition — while its cartridges were longer than the 13 x 64 mm rounds of its German rough equivalent, the MG 131, the 81 mm Italian rounds were still shorter than the standard 12.7x99 mm rounds of the American &quot;Ma Deuce&quot;; with the result that the energy at the muzzle was 10,000 joules vs. 16,000. The rate of fire was about 18 rounds/second (1,080 rounds per minute) or 0.63 kg (1.39 lb).
On 21 August 1941, &quot;Tenente&quot; Giulio Reiner, one of the most skillful and experienced pilots of 9° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, flew the &quot;military control flight&quot; in Lonate Pozzolo, The &quot;Ufficio tecnico&quot; (Technical Bureau) recorded the maximum speed of 1,078.27 km/h in the &quot;Folgore&quot; in a vertical dive, with 5.8 G. forces while pulling out of the dive. &quot;Ingegner&quot; Mario Castoldi, the designer of the 202 questioned whether Reiner had properly flown the test. In fact, during the vertical dive, Reiner had to face very strong vibrations throughout the airframe and in the control stick, while the flying controls were locked and the propeller blades were jammed at maximum pitch. The clean aerodynamics offered by the inline engine permitted dive speeds high enough for pilots to encounter the then-unknown phenomenon of compressibility.

The empty weight of the new C.202 (approximately 2,350 kg/5,180 lb) gradually increased throughout production, and due to the thickness of metal used it was also comparatively heavy, yet this class of aircraft was still considered lightweight compared to other contemporary fighter designs. The Macchi&#x27;s mass was around 300 kg (660 lb) higher than the comparable Bf 109E German fighter, consequently, the power-to-weight ratio was considerably lower while wing loading was higher. The relatively high diving speed of the type has been attributed to the exceptionally clean design of its fuselage.

Some of the defects present on the new fighter could have been easily resolved, such as a tendency for the landing gear to inadvertently lower when pulling out of a steep dive, a machine gun bonnet that often broke, frequent jamming of the ammunition belts and the rapid crystallizing and eventual shearing of the air cleaner intake caused by vibrations generated by the engine. Other defects, such as the unreliability of the radio sets and of the oxygen systems and the limited armament could not be addressed with such ease. However, different types of radio sets and accompanying antenna were installed in some aircraft.

==Operational history==

===Service introduction===
During 1940, the &quot;Folgore&quot; was put into production using imported DB 601Aa engines, while Alfa Romeo set up production of the engine under license as the RA.1000 R.C.41-I &quot;Monsone&quot; (Monsoon). Due to initial delays in engine production, Macchi resorted to completing some C.202 airframes as C.200s, powered by Fiat-built radial engines. Nevertheless, by late 1942, &quot;Folgores&quot; outnumbered all other fighter aircraft in the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;.

The first units selected to be equipped with the C.202 Series I were the 17° and 6° &quot;Gruppi&quot;, from 1° &quot;Stormo&quot;, based at the airfield of Campoformido, near Udine, and the 9° &quot;Gruppo&quot; of 4° &quot;Stormo&quot;, based in Gorizia. Their pilots started to train on the new fighter in May–June 1941, at Lonate Pozzolo (Varese), the airfield of the Macchi. Although first deployed in mid-1941, the C.202 did not see action until later that year; this delay came as a consequence of the many defects that were discovered upon the first fighter deliveries. Some defects appeared similar to those on the early C. 200 version: on 3 August, during a mock dogfight, &quot;Sergente Maggiore&quot; Antonio Valle – an experienced pilot, credited with two kills in Marmarica and recipient of a &quot;Medaglia di Bronzo al Valor Militare&quot; (Bronze Medal of Military Valor) – at a height of entered in a flat spin and could not recover or bail out, losing his life.
The oxygen system was also regarded as being inefficient, causing, at least during the first sorties, up to 50/60 per cent of the pilots to abandon their missions and in some cases having been determined to have caused fatal accidents.
By November 1941, the C.202 had appeared on the Libyan front. However, according to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, the type may have been more of a hindrance than help in that theatre, attributing this to the pilots flying it only being semi-trained, which was in turn caused by the type being rushed into service as Axis air superiority had faded in North Africa, and a lack of spares to maintain it with. The C.202 had a better time on the home front, where supplies were more plentiful and units had more time to prepare and familiarise themselves with the type. The type was quickly put to use outside of North Africa, seeing limited service against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front where, between 1941 and 1943, together with C.200s, the fighter reportedly achieved an 88 to 15 victory/loss ratio. However, according to authors Jeffery Ethell and Pietro Tonizzo, that ratio refers only to the C.200 &quot;Saetta&quot;.

===Malta===
The &quot;Folgore&quot; first saw service during the Siege of Malta on 29 or 30 September 1941; their first mission was the interception of British Hurricanes over Sicily.

From early October 1941, the Italian units commenced extensive operations over Malta, which provided many opportunities for encounters with RAF fighters. From its initial combat missions, the C.202 displayed marked superiority over the Hawker Hurricane II, which formed the island&#x27;s main form of aerial defence at the time. However, the Macchi&#x27;s main weakness, its weak armament, proved to be a problem even at this stage. Over the skies of the besieged island, the new Macchi fighter was not only used to conduct fighter operations, but also for performing ground attack runs and aerial reconnaissance missions. Among the pilots who flew recce C.202s on Malta was Adriano Visconti, later to become a famed ace and credited with at least 10 air victories.

The presence of the &quot;Folgores&quot; in Maltese skies was to last only until the end of November, when most of the unit was transferred to the deteriorating North Africa front. The 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; returned to Sicily at the beginning of April 1942, with 10º &quot;Gruppo&quot;, to Castelvetrano. The airport was already the base of &quot;Gruppi&quot; 7º and 16º from 54º &quot;Stormo&quot; equipped with some C.202s besides the Macchi C.200s and Fiat CR.42s. The 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; C.202s flew the first sortie, on 21 April, claiming a Spitfire V, while escorting three more &quot;recce&quot; Macchis from 54º Stormo. The 4º &quot;Stormo&quot; flew its last mission on Malta on 19 May before moving back to North Africa. In the meantime, the 16° &quot;Gruppo&quot; had started to re-equip with the C.202s at the end of 1941. During May 1942, the Macchis of 51° &quot;Stormo&quot; and 23° &quot;Gruppo&quot; (3° &quot;Stormo&quot;) also arrived.

During Operation Harpoon, one of two simultaneous Allied convoys sent to supply Malta in the Axis-dominated central Mediterranean Sea in mid-June 1942, C.202s were involved in clashing with Sea Hurricanes. It was during this time that the Axis had to abandon their plans for the invasion of Malta, Operation Herkules (Operation C 3) due to the aircraft and men being necessary elsewhere. On 7 March 1942, the carrier delivered the first Spitfires to Malta, and the Axis&#x27; air-superiority started to shift in favour of the Allies. At the end of June, however, about 60 C.202s could be mustered in Sicily to operate against Malta, which had been receiving the Spitfire Mk. V in ever-increasing quantities. The Macchi could out-turn the Spitfire, but the &quot;Folgores&quot; suffered from the lack of a more powerful armament and, without radios, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; pilots were forced to communicate with one another by waggling their wings and, consequently, had to adopt formations that were too tight and less effective in combat. Their performance had also suffered due to the lack of radar, which the RAF were making extensive use of to successfully vector their fighters against their aerial opposition.

Nevertheless, the C.202&#x27;s pilots were able to achieve many successes against the British Spitfires. The top scoring Italian pilots in this theatre included &quot;Capitano&quot; Furio Niclot-Doglio (a 7 kills ace, shot down and killed on 27 July 1942 by RAF ace George &quot;Screwball&quot; Beurling) and &quot;Sergente&quot; Ennio Tarantola. Both pilots flew with 51° &quot;Stormo&quot; C.T., the most successful Italian unit over Malta, having reportedly achieved a score of 97 aircraft destroyed for the loss of only 17 &quot;Folgores&quot;.

===North Africa and Pantelleria===
On 29 July 1941, the three first operational C.202s of 4° &quot;Stormo&quot;, 97ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, landed at Merna airport. On 26 November, during Operation Crusader, 19 Macchis of 9° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; were sent to Africa, and by the end of the month the whole 1° &quot;Stormo&quot; was in Libya, both units taking part in the last stages of the British offensive that led to the raising of the siege of Tobruk, and the retreat of Italian and German troops in Cyrenaica in December. During its initial combats over the Western Desert, the &quot;Folgore&quot; was quite a surprise to British pilots and it remained a respected adversary. Squadron Leader Dennis Harry Clark, D.F.C. and A.F.C., in his book &quot;What Were They Like to Fly&quot; (1964), stated: &quot;Sleek, supremely fast (..) the 202 was capable of out-turning our P-40s with ease; but the majority would pull away effortlessly into a climbing roll off or a roll off the top when things became at all hectic... Their aircraft was superior to ours on all counts.&quot; 

In the desert war, incursions by the SAS behind enemy lines were often aimed at destroying aircraft on the ground. Macchi 202s of 1° &quot;Stormo&quot; based at Uadi Tamet had been transferred from Italy one month before and recently relocated from Bir el Merduma because the airbase was too exposed to SAS attacks. 1° &quot;Stormo&quot; had 60 fighters, 17°&quot;Gruppo&quot; around 30. In a month of combat, the latter lost a total of eight fighters to raids. On the night of 28 December 1941 the SAS managed to destroy a further nine aircraft. After this attack the Italians were forced to move their remaining aircraft well away from the front lines to avoid incurring further losses to such raids.

During 1942, Bf 109F/Gs and Macchi C.202s fought against the Allied air forces in North Africa. At the time of Rommel&#x27;s offensive on Tobruk, 5ª &quot;Squadra Aerea&quot; (&quot;Aviation Corps&quot;), based in North Africa, had three Macchi wings: 1° &quot;Stormo&quot; had 47 C.202s (40 serviceable), 2° &quot;Stormo&quot; had 63 C.200s (52) while 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; had 57(47). This, coupled with the 32 Cant Z.1007s, was one of the most powerful fighter forces that the Italians fielded in the war, and constituted almost a tenth of the overall &quot;Folgore&quot; production.
During April 1942 the 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; solved the frequent problems to the oxygen masks by adopting the German Dräger &quot;oxygen apparatus&quot; that already equipped the Bf 109s.
During the Battle of Bir Hakeim the C.202s performed successfully against the assorted fighters of the Desert Air Force, typically using &quot;dive and zoom&quot; tactics, similar to those of Luftwaffe fighters. In the morning of 26 May, about 60 &quot;Folgore&quot; from 1° and 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; attacked Gambut airfield destroying and damaging many Allied aircraft surprised while taking off. Even if often outnumbered, the C.202s achieved 22 confirmed air victories against Hurricanes and P-40s for the loss of just five of their number, a kill/loss ratio of 4,4/1, bettering the Bf 109s&#x27; (3,5/1). On 23 December 1942, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; authorized the use of under-wing jettisonable tanks on the C.202s of 6° and 7° &quot;Gruppo&quot; based in Pantelleria, significantly boosting their endurance. By the end of the year, the growing strength of the Allied forces was overwhelming and after the defeat in the skies over Malta as well as El-Alamein the last operational Axis units lost their air superiority in the Mediterranean. The Germans and the Italians succeeded in establishing a bridgehead in Tunisia, and later in December the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; transferred four fighter squadrons there; the 5ª &quot;Squadra Aerea&quot;, which had left Libya and retreated to Tunisia, had previously repatriated all unserviceable aircraft to Italy. By early 1943, &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had only 54 serviceable C.202 across 12 squadrons.

By 21 February 1943 the 5ª &quot;Squadra Aerea&quot; still had the 6°&quot;Gruppo&quot; C.T. with three squadrons of C.202s at Sfax and Gammarth in the northern sector, and in the southern sector, 3°&quot;Stormo&quot; with six squadrons of C.200s and C.202s at El Hamma. Although these forces were insufficient they nevertheless achieved notable successes. On 6–7 March 1943, C.202 pilots claimed 19 RAF and two USAAF aircraft, for the loss of two &quot;Folgore&quot;. Pilots of 16° &quot;Gruppo Assalto&quot;, an attack unit, downed no fewer than 10 aircraft.

The Macchis continued fighting while retreating to Tunisia and then in the defence of Sicily, Sardinia and Italy against an increasingly stronger opponent. The Macchis of two groups at Korba were forced to concentrate 40 C.202s (both 7° and 16°, 54° &quot;Stormo&quot;), and on 8 May 1943, almost all their C.202s were destroyed on the ground by marauding Spitfires. Only eleven aircraft were repaired by 10 May 1943 and retreated to Italy. Because no transport aircraft were available every surviving fighter had two men inside, a pilot and a mechanic. At least one was destroyed and the two crewmen wounded after crash-landing on a beach near Reggio Calabria. During the Tunisian operation the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; lost a total of 22 C.202s in the air and 47 on the ground.

===Eastern Front operations===
During May 1942, the 22° &quot;Gruppo Caccia&quot;, which had reached its operational limit, was replaced by the newly formed 21° &quot;Gruppo Autonomo C.T.&quot; composed of 356ª, 382ª, 361ª and 386ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot;. This unit, commanded by &quot;Maggiore&quot; (Major) Ettore Foschini, brought new C.202s and 18 new Macchi C.200 fighters. During August 1942, at the beginning of the German offensive, they were deployed at the Stalino, Lughansk, Kantemirovka and Millerovo airfields, typically performing ground attack strikes against the Red Army positions along the east Don river during October–November 1942. In this theatre, the fighters were operated under adverse climate conditions (40° to 45° below zero and heavy snow storms) as well as frequently coming under heavy harassment from Russian fighter-bombers. As a consequence of these operational circumstances, 21° &quot;Gruppo&quot; – which had 17 C.202s on strength – were rarely able to conduct sorties; as such, only a total of 17 missions were flown with &quot;Folgores&quot; on the Eastern Front during a four-month period.

When they were able to conduct combat operations, the C.202 were frequently used as escorts alongside their older C.200 siblings for Fiat BR.20M and Caproni Ca.311 bombers in attacks against Soviet columns, during which they would typically be facing aerial opposition from great numbers of Soviet Air Forces (VVS) fighters. The C.202 were also regularly used to escort CANT Z.1007bis during the latter&#x27;s reconnaissance missions, as well as for German transport aircraft. During one such mission, on 11 December 1942, which involved the escorting of several Junkers Ju 52s en route to Stalingrad, &quot;Tenente Pilota&quot; Gino Lionello was shot down and forced to bail out from his &quot;Folgore&quot;.

After the abandonment of advanced airfields between December 1942 – January 1943 at Voroshilovgrad, Stalino and Tscerkow, the Italian air units were operated in a series of defensive actions against a more potent Soviet air offensive, consisting mainly of Ilyushin IL-2s &quot;Shturmoviks&quot; and Petlyakov Pe-2s. During March 1943, the &quot;Corpo Aereo Italiano&quot; was detached to Odessa airbase, joining Reggiane Re. 2000 Héja I of the Hungarian &quot;MKHL&quot; 1 and 2/1 &quot;Vadászszázad&quot;, as well as IAR 80C and Bf 109E/G of Romanian &quot;FARR&quot; 4 and 5 detached at the same base and Saky (Crimea) in a holding action against the VVS armada of 2,000 aircraft, at a time when the Axis air forces only countered with 300 operative aircraft, which were further constrained by having very small quantities of fuel, munitions and equipment available. On 17 January 1943, the last effective operation of &quot;Corpo Aereo Italiano in Russia&quot; occurred, when a single mixed formation of 25 surviving Macchi fighters (out of a remaining total of 30 C.200s and nine C.202s) attacked several Red Army armored and motorized infantry columns in support of German and Italian units that were encircled in Millerovo.

===Sicilian and Italian campaigns===
The C.202s played a significant role in the defense of Sicily and Southern Italy against bombing attacks launched by the USAAF, however, by the time of Allied invasion of Sicily during July 1943, their effectiveness had been diminished considerably as a result of attrition, which had reduced the number available. Furthermore, it was increasingly recognised that 20 mm cannons were required in order to cause enough damage, thus a mixture of Bf 109F/Gs, Macchi MC.205s and Fiat G.55s were deployed to replace the remaining C.202s as soon as possible. Mixed units (such as the 51° &quot;Stormo&quot;, Sardinia) were formed with C.202s, yet were often serving with C.205s as well.

By the signing of the 1943 Armistice with Italy, there were only 186 &quot;Folgores&quot; remaining, of which roughly 100 aircraft were still considered to be in a serviceable condition. Several C.202s served with the Allied-aligned Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, and some of these were subsequently reconstructed into C.205s or C.202/205 with the Veltro&#x27;s engine. Others served as trainers in the Axis-aligned &quot;Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; (National Republican Air Force) of the Italian Social Republic (RSI) and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German Air Force).

===&quot;Folgore&quot; aces===
The Macchi C.202 was flown by almost all of the most successful Italian aces, Adriano Visconti, Leonardo Ferrulli, Luigi Gorrini, Franco Lucchini, Franco Bordoni Bisleri, Furio Niclot Doglio and top scorer &quot;Sergente Maggiore&quot; Teresio Vittorio Martinoli, credited with 22 individual &quot;kills&quot; plus two probables, as well as 14 shared. Seventeen of these victories were obtained in 73ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, 9° &quot;Gruppo&quot; (from 4° &quot;Stormo&quot;). On 25 August 1944, Martinoli was killed during a training flight with the P-39 Airacobra. &quot;Capitano&quot; Franco Lucchini, who was credited with 21/26 individual victories and 52 shared, began to fly the &quot;Folgore&quot; after having already shot down 10 enemy aircraft. On 5 July 1943, Lucchini was killed in his C.202 while attacking a B-17 over Gerbini, Sicily.

===In Croatian service===
About 20–22 Macchi C.202s were flown by Croatia, who typically operated them in the interceptor role against Allied bombers. During 1944, the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, &quot;Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske&quot; (ZNDH), received several batches of C.202s. During January, eight brand-new &quot;Folgore&quot; fighters arrived at Zagreb&#x27;s Lucko airfield. Two weeks later, another four aircraft arrived; one of these was reportedly lost during a test-flight. The first batch of 16 &quot;Folgores&quot; delivered to the ZNDH was from the XII series, built by Breda following the German occupation of Northern Italy. These fighters equipped &quot;Kroat. JGr 1&quot; and retained their Luftwaffe markings whilst in service with the unit. During 1944, the Croatian Air Force Legion (HZL) fighter squadron had returned to Croatia from service on the Eastern Front. Upon its return, the HZL was redesignated &quot;Kroat. JGr 1&quot;, while its operational fighter squadron was redesignated &quot;2./(Kroat.)JGr&quot;; this unit was equipped with Macchis. A second training / operational conversion squadron was also formed, designated &quot;3./(Kroat.)JGr&quot; and equipped with Fiat G.50, Macchi C.200 and Fiat CR.42 fighters. During March 1944, they were scrambled for the first time against an American raid west of Zagreb but combat was avoided; Croatian Macchi pilots had been initially instructed to attack only those aircraft which had already been damaged or had become separated from their main formations.

On 24 April 1944, the first confirmed air victory was claimed by &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Leopold Hrastovcan against an American B-24 that was shot down near the village of Zapresic (Zagorje). According to some sources, during these first sorties, Croat C.202s claimed between 11 and 16 aerial victories, but only three further were confirmed. During May 1944, the Croatians received four C.202s from the Luftwaffe in Niš, Serbia; during the ferry flight, a single Macchi crash landed near Zemun airfield. Around June 1944, the Croat unit received the last six &quot;Folgore&quot; and three or four brand new Macchi C.205s. Irrespective of the Croatian Air Force Legion having been disbanded at the end of July, after which it was replaced by the Croatian Air Force Group (&quot;HZS&quot;), the fighters themselves remained at Borovo. During a period of intensive activity in mid-1944, the squadron had claimed some 20 Allied aircraft shot down. By late 1944, those C.202s that were still in a flight-worthy condition, based in Borovo, were used by Croatian cadets for training purposes. During September 1944, Luftwaffe pilots flew all of the remaining airworthy &quot;Folgores&quot; to Borongaj, where they were used only for training.

According to aviation authors Dragan Savic and Boris Ciglic, Croatian pilots did not at first have a high opinion of the Macchi fighter, in part due to its armament consisting of just a pair of 12.7 mm and two 7.7mm machine guns, which were regarded as scarcely effective against the heavily armed US four-engined bombers. Eastern front veteran &quot;Major&quot; Josip Helebrant, an 11-kill flying ace (used to flying Bf 109 Gs) and the CO of &quot;2./(Kroat.)JGr&quot;, had reportedly initially regarded the Macchis as &quot;old, weary and unusable&quot;, and described the morale of his men as &quot;low&quot;, and his unit&#x27;s results as &quot;nil&quot;, primarily because of the NDH&#x27;s underdeveloped air-raid warning system, which saw the Croatian Macchi fighters often taking off to intercept attacking Allied bombers that were already flying overhead.

===Postwar service===
As a consequence of the Allied aerial bombing against the Italian Social Republic, during which the manufacturing facilities of the Macchi company had sustained damage during 1944, both the production life and combat career of both the C.202 and the further refined C.205 were cut short. Post-war, some of the aircraft which had survived the conflict were joined by a small number of newly manufactured C.205s. The surviving aircraft were operated by the Aeronautica Militare Italiana, where they were used as trainer aircraft as late as 1948 before being phased out entirely.

The Royal Egyptian Air Force ordered a total of 42 C.205s, but 31 of these were in fact re-engined &quot;Folgores&quot; (C.202s), armed with only a pair of 12.7 mm Breda machine guns. Some of these aircraft later fought during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the State of Israel; the Egyptian fighters were reportedly still in service as late as 1951. Switzerland had placed an order for 20 C.202s, however, none of these were ever delivered; this was due to the deteriorating war situation at the time (May 1943) that meant that Italy no longer had the capability to export these types of aircraft. During mid-1944, at least 12 C.202s, and probably another 12 aircraft, were delivered to the Croatian Air Force Legion for operational use against the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces over Croatia, all of which being ex-LW fighters.

Those allied pilots who flew against the &quot;Folgore&quot; were frequently impressed with its performance and manoeuvrability. The C.202 was often considered to have been superior to both the British Hawker Hurricane and the American Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk that it commonly fought against, at first on the Libyan front, as well as being the equal of the Supermarine Spitfire Mk. V. The C.202 was able to out-turn all three, although the Spitfire possessed a superior rate of climb. The C.202 could effectively fly against the Hurricane, Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Bell P-39 Airacobra, Curtiss P-40 and even the Spitfire at low altitudes, but the aircraft&#x27;s combat effectiveness was somewhat hampered by its weak armament.

==Variants and production==
Like its predecessor C.200, the C.202 had relatively few modifications, with only 116 modifications during its career, most of them invisible, externally. The total series production ordered was 1,454: 900 to Breda, 150 to SAI Ambrosini, 403 to Aermacchi. The amount produced was actually 1,106 and not 1,220 as previous stated. Breda built 649 (Series XVI deleted, Series XII and XV partially completed caused the difference); Aermacchi made 390 examples, SAI only 67.

One of the differences between prototype and series production was the lack of radio antenna and the retractable tailwheel (these differences resulting in a slightly higher top speed); the difference in speed was not so great and so, the series version had the fixed tailwheel and the radio antenna. The support for the engine, originally steel, was replaced with a lighter aluminium structure.
;C.202
: Starting with the &quot;Serie&quot; VII, the fighter had a new wing with a provision for two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns and an armored windscreen (previously, only the armored seat and the self-sealing tanks were provided). Serie IX&#x27;s weight was 2,515/3,069 kg with the 7.7 machine guns seldom installed.

;C.202AS
:Dust filters for operations in North Africa (AS – &quot;Africa Settentrionale&quot;, North Africa); they affected the speed little and so, almost all Folgores had them and thus were in C.202AS standard; finally, starting with Serie XI there was a provision for two 50, 100 or 160 kg bombs, small bombs clusters (10, 15, 20 kg) or 100 L drop tanks. These underwing pylons were rarely utilized, as Folgores were needed in the interceptor roles.

;C.202CB
:Underwing hardpoints for bombs or drop tanks (CB – Caccia Bombardiere, Fighter-Bomber)

;C.202EC
:Likely standing for &quot;Esperimento Cannoni&quot;, it was another link between &quot;Veltro&quot; and &quot;Folgore&quot;. One aircraft (Serie III, s/n MM 91974) was fitted with a pair of gondola-mounted 20 mm cannon with 200 rounds each (it flew on 12 May 1943); later it was turned into a C.205V. Another four examples were so equipped, but, despite the good results in the trials (aimed to boost the Folgore&#x27;s firepower), there was no further production, because the cannons penalized the aircraft&#x27;s performance. There was, in the &quot;Folgore&quot;, no room to mount them inside the wings or the nose, so the MC.205V/Ns was developed. Nevertheless, the XII series could have introduced a new wing with MG 151 provisions. This is not well documented, as this series was produced by Breda after the Armistice, and was interrupted with the devastating USAAF bombings, together with many other aircraft; among them, also Macchi 205 production and the 206 prototype (30 April 1944; in five days, the USAAF destroyed both Fiat and Macchi facilities, eliminating all of Italy&#x27;s fighter production).

;C.202RF
:Equipped with cameras for photo-reconnaissance missions (R – Ricognizione, Reconnaissance), very few produced, later the recce role was covered by Veltros.

;C.202D
:Prototype with a revised radiator, under the nose, similar to the P-40 (s/n. MM 7768)

;C.202 AR.4
:At least one such aircraft was modified to server as a &quot;drone director&quot; (coupled with S.79s), and it was planned to use &quot;Folgores&quot; also as &#x27;Mistel&#x27;, with an AR.4 &quot;radiobomba&quot; (a form of remote-control kamikaze bomber).

;C.202 with DB 605 and other engines
:Macchi MC.202 with DB 605 were initially known as MC.202 bis; later as the C.205 Veltro. Macchi C.200, C.202 and C.205 shared many common components. The MC.200A/2 was a MC.200 with &quot;Folgore&quot; wings (MM.8238). After the Armistice, Aeronautica Sannita or the Co-Belligerent Italian AF began MC.205 modifying C.202s with DB 605s. These aircraft were known also as &quot;Folgeltro&quot;. Around two dozen were made. Another &quot;Folgore&quot; was modified with DB 601E-1 (1,350 PS) in mid-1944, but this hybrid with Bf 109F technology crashed on 21 January 1946. The MC.204 was a version with a L.121 Asso (1,000 hp); proposed early in the war (28 September 1940), but all the effort continued only with DB 601 engines. Early Folgores had original DB 601s, while from the &quot;Serie&quot; VII, RC.41s were available.

After the war, 31 C.202 airframes were fitted with license-built Daimler-Benz DB 605 engines and sold to Egypt as C.205 &quot;Veltros&quot;, with another 11 &#x27;real&#x27; MC.205s (with MG 151 cannon in the wings).

==Surviving aircraft==

;Macchi C.202 &quot;73-7/M.M. 9667 (serial no. 366)&quot;
:Presently on display at the Italian Air Force Museum in Vigna di Valle Airport, near Bracciano, Italy. This C.202 was built by Breda in early 1943 as a &quot;Serie&quot; XI sample. In March 1943 this &quot;Folgore&quot; was assigned to 54° &quot;Stormo&quot; of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and subsequently it served in 5° &quot;Stormo&quot;, with &quot;Aeronautica Cobelligerante&quot; (Italian Co-Belligerant Air Force). After the war it was a training aircraft at the &quot;Accademia Navale&quot; in Livorno. Currently the aircraft has the markings of the ace Giulio Reiner. Not all the parts of the aircraft are original (a panel of the engine cowling comes from a Macchi C.205 &quot;Veltro&quot;).

;Macchi C.202 &quot;M.M. 9476(?)&quot;
:Shown in the markings of the 90ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, 10° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, 4° &quot;Stormo&quot;, was dramatically displayed in Gallery 205 above the World War II Aviation diorama at the US National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian, Washington, DC. Still airworthy at Freeman Field, Indiana, US, in 1945, as FE-300, was stored for many years. Restoration was completed in mid-1970. No identity marking was found, though this is the least reconstructed &quot;Folgore&quot; survivor. It may have originally been a &quot;Serie&quot; VI to IX, probably the M.M. 9476 sample.

<text>Westmorland County (2021 population: 163,576) is a county in New Brunswick, a province of Canada. It is in the south-eastern part of the province. It contains the fast-growing commercial centre of Moncton and its northern and eastern suburbs. Also located in the county are the university town of Sackville and the local tourist destination of Shediac.

Westmorland County is centrally located in the Maritimes and is New Brunswick&#x27;s most populous county. Fishing and tourism are important industries along the Northumberland Strait shore, and there is some mixed farming in the Petitcodiac River Valley and in the Tantramar Marsh region. The city of Moncton accounts for half of the county&#x27;s population and has developed as a major transportation, distribution, commercial and retail centre. Dorchester is the historic shire town.

==Origins==
The county, once a part of Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, was one of the original eight counties delineated shortly after the creation of the British colony of New Brunswick in 1784. Initially it included what is now Albert County and part of Saint John County.

Due to sweeping social reforms of the Louis Robichaud premiership, the counties no longer serve their role as regional local government and administrative units.

<doc id="176530" wikidata="Q5688" url="?curid=176530" title="Macchi C.205 Veltro">
<text>The Macchi C.205 Veltro () (also known as MC.205, &quot;MC&quot; standing for &quot;Macchi Castoldi&quot;) was a Second World War-era fighter aircraft designed and produced by the Italian aircraft manufacturer Aeronautica Macchi. Along with the Reggiane Re.2005 Sagittario and Fiat G.55 Centauro, the Macchi C.205 was one of the three &quot;&quot;Serie&quot; 5&quot; Italian fighters built around the powerful German-sourced Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine.

The C.205 was a development of the earlier C.202 &quot;Folgore&quot;, work on which commenced in 1941. On 19 April 1942, the C.205V &quot;Veltro&quot; performed its maiden flight. During testing, the type proved that it could achieve a maximum speed of roughly . Due to a combination of design choices, including the DB 605 engine and a relatively high wing loading, it was capable of achieving comparable performance to contemporary frontline German fighter aircraft. Production aircraft were typically armed with a pair of 20 mm Mauser MG 151/20 cannon along with 12.7 mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns; the type could also be equipped with underwing bomb racks when conducting ground-attack missions.

Entering squadron service with the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; during February 1943, the C.205 soon garnered a strong reputation amongst both Allied and Axis pilots; it has been widely regarded as one of the best Italian aircraft of the Second World War. The C.205 proved to be extremely effective in aerial combat, being responsible for the destruction of a large number of Allied bombers. The C. 205 proved capable of engaging fighters such as the North American P-51D Mustang on equal terms; this performance reportedly encouraged the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to use a number of these aircraft to equip one &quot;Gruppe&quot;. The C.205 was allegedly capable of matching even the best Allied opponents in terms of both speed and maneuverability. Italy&#x27;s highest-scoring ace, Adriano Visconti, achieved 11 of his 26 credited victories in the few weeks he was able to fly the &quot;Veltro&quot;, while the top-scoring &quot;Sergente Maggiore pilota&quot; Luigi Gorrini shooting down 14 enemy aircraft plus six damaged with the C.205.

The C.205 saw only a relatively small production run prior to the end of the conflict, which was primarily the result of various limitations in place on the Italian war economy. Akin to the Supermarine Spitfire, the &quot;Veltro&quot; features some complex elements in its construction and was fairly slow to build. During the immediate postwar years, Macchi continued to refurbish and sell C.205s, often through the conversion of surplus C.202s. One key customer for the type during the late 1940s was the Egyptian Air Force, which ordered 62 C.205Vs. Several of these Egyptian fighters briefly saw action during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War against the Israeli Air Force; Israeli intelligence agents allegedly sought to damage C.205s in Italy before they could be delivered to Egypt. The C.205 was phased out of service during the mid 1950s in favour of jet-propelled fighter aircraft.

==Design and development==
===Background===
During 1941, seeking to further improve the performance of the C.202 fighter, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; decided to license-build the German Daimler-Benz DB 605 liquid-cooled supercharged inverted V-12 engine in Italy, which Fiat produced as the RA.1050 R.C.58 &quot;Tifone&quot; (Typhoon). Fighter manufacturers were invited to enter versions of their designs using this engine as the &quot;caccia della serie 5 &quot;(&quot;series-5 fighter&quot;) and were provided with imported DB 605s for prototype use. All of the designs used the number 5 in the name, thus Macchi&#x27;s submission became the C.205 (instead of C.202bis or C.203).

Macchi had adopted a licence-built DB 601 engine for the C.202, an engine which was closely comparable in size to the later, more powerful DB 605. This meant that the C.202 airframe could be easily adapted for the DB 605; accordingly, Macchi opted to have the fuselage remain identical aft of the firewall. The resulting aircraft, which was designated C.205V &quot;Veltro&quot;, was considered to be a stop-gap measure while the definitive variant was intended to be the 205N &quot;Orione&quot; (N stood for &quot;new&quot;).

On 19 April 1942, the C.205V &quot;Veltro&quot; performed its maiden flight; much of the subsequent flight testing was conducted at Guidonia Airfield on the outskirts of Rome. Testing revealed that both the Fiat G.55 &quot;Centauro&quot; and Re.2005 &quot;Sagittario&quot; were capable of greater performance while flying at high altitudes, largely due to their larger wing area. In fact, the &quot;Veltro&quot; used the same wing as the earlier &quot;Folgore&quot; but its weight had increased from and the wing loading from 140 kg/m2 to 153.6 kg/m2. The &quot;Veltro&quot;″s performance was similar to German designs with their higher wing loading, and was at its best at medium altitudes where it could reach . The C.205 &quot;Veltro&quot; was placed in production until the G.55 and the Re.2005 could become available.

The first 100 &quot;Veltro Serie I&quot; were solely armed with machine guns, however, many aircraft were also fitted with the 20 mm MG 151 cannon. There were no &quot;Serie II&quot; built, but 150 &quot;Serie III&quot; were ordered, which were fitted with wing cannons as a standard.

Some delay was incurred by the necessity of re-engineering the aircraft&#x27;s forward fuselage, leading to several months passing before the &quot;205N&quot; was flight-capable. On 1 November 1942, the C.205N1 made its first flight; at this point, the armament consisting of a single 20 mm cannon that fired through the propeller hub along with four cowling-mounted 12.7 mm (.5 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns for which it carried 300–400 and 1,400 rounds of ammunition respectively. This configuration allowed for a higher ceiling at the cost of a reduced speed []. The better aerodynamics (with a longer and more streamlined rear fuselage) provided an advantage over the Macchi C.205V/MG151 [].

On 19 May 1943, the second prototype, designated C.205N2, took place; during testing, it reportedly attained , which was marginally slower than the C.205N1 with a correspondingly longer time to reach its operational altitude. It was equipped with a single engine-mounted 20 mm cannon, a pair of wing-mounted 20 mm cannon and two fuselage-mounted 12.7 mm (.5 in) machine guns. The ammunition load comprised 600 or more 12.7 mm (.5 in) rounds and a maximum of around 900 20 mm rounds which was much heavier than that carried by the C.205N1 and more than that of the Reggiane and the Fiat which carried 490–550 and 650 20 mm rounds respectively. Although 1,200 aircraft were ordered, the design was abandoned due to the Italian armistice.

The N-series aircraft should have performed better than the C.205V but Macchi test pilot Guido Carestiato noted that their flying characteristics were inferior to the lighter and more agile C.205 &quot;Veltro&quot;. The later series also experienced overheating while climbing.

===Design===
The C.205, known initially as the C.202bis, was generally similar to the previous &quot;Folgore&quot;, although there were numerous differences in the fuselage: the tail was larger, the cockpit and its hump were redesigned, the antenna mast was bigger and some modifications were made to the wings. Both the C.202 and C.205 had the port wing 8&quot; longer than the starboard to compensate lift for engine torque. While new-build C.205s were furnished with a more aerodynamic retractable tailwheel, converted C.202 airframes remained the fixed tailwheel arrangement instead.

The C.205 was a single-seat, all-metal, monoplane fighter, intended primarily as an interceptor but with ground attack and escort capabilities. The long nose housed the DB605 engine which drove a three-blade, constant-speed metal propeller, with the main fuel tank situated between the engine and the cockpit. The C.205 was fitted with a twin-barrel radiator, which was positioned underneath the centre section of the fuselage directly beneath the cockpit; this arrangement provided superior airflow, and thereby engine cooling, to its counterpart on the C.202. Within the aircraft&#x27;s compact rear section was the radio equipment, oxygen cylinder and an 80 L (20 US gal) reserve fuel tank. The wings were made of light aluminium alloys and steel, having two spars and three sections, housing two additional fuel tanks, and the fully retractable wide-set main undercarriage gear. Apart from the all-metal flaps in the inner wing, all the other control surfaces were metal-framed and fabric-covered. &quot;Veltros&quot; had self-sealing fuel tanks, an armoured seat, and armoured windscreen as standard. The cramped cockpit possessed a limited field-of-view, but some examples were fitted with a rear-view mirror.

The 827 kg/1,823 lb (normal) payload consisted of the fully equipped pilot (85 kg/187 lb), fuel (307 kg/677 lb), two Breda machine guns and two Mauser MG 151/20 cannon (60 and 84 kg/130 and 185 lb respectively), 740 rounds of 12.7 mm (.5 in) ammunition (76 kg/168 lb), 500 rounds of 20 mm ammunition (100 kg/220 lb), and other sundry items such as oil (33 kg/73 lb), oxygen cylinder (12 kg/26 lb) and radio equipment. Additionally, 100 L (30 US gal) fuel tanks or 160 kg (350 lb) of bombs could be carried on two underwing hardpoints. Due to a lack of passenger transport aircraft, modifications were made to a C.205 to enable it to carry eight passengers in the belly of the fuselage and, among others, three pilots of 51° Wing (including Adriano Visconti) made the journey from Sardinia to Italy after the Armistice in this manner.

&quot;Veltros&quot; originally had &quot;tropical&quot; pattern camouflage, with a sand brown base coat and irregular black-green lines all over their surface (referred to as &quot;smoke rings&quot;). Those in service with Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana were painted an overall dark green (nearly black), while others adopted a variation of the &quot;tropical&quot; pattern or carried a camouflage pattern based on the German &quot;Splinter Pattern&quot; consisting of RLM 74 and 75, Gey/Green over RLM 76 Blue.

===Relative performance===
The following are relative performance and characteristics data for the three versions of the C.205 (or MC.205, as the machines designed by Castoldi were often called):


Although these figures provide an indication of the relative performance of each variant, and showed that the &quot;Orione&quot;, especially the N2, suffered as a result of the weight increase (particularly in climbs), they are not truly representative as they were obtained under different test conditions. As opposed to the two N versions, the &quot;Veltro&quot; was tested under ideal conditions, i.e. at light weight ( and with full emergency power (2,750 rpm). In a climb to , a &quot;Veltro III&quot; series, fully equipped and using combat (not emergency) power at 2,600 rpm needed seven minutes.

==Production==
At the end of evaluation tests, the C.205 began series production, with a first order of 250 aircraft. The first C.205 left the factory in September 1942. Efforts were made to get the type produced as quickly as possible, however, the speed of production was relatively slow (about 12 machines per month) in spite of these endeavours. This low production rate had been attributed to shortage of both engines and various strategic materials. It was only in June 1943 that Macchi managed to complete the first batch of 100 fighters. It took until September before production reached 177 examples, of which 146 were delivered to &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; units.

==Operational history==

The C.205 entered production only five months after its maiden flight and began reaching front line units in February 1943. At the end of April, the 1° &quot;Stormo&quot;, based in Pantelleria, is the first unit to enter action with the C.205, on Mediterranean, escorting maritime and aerial convoys to and from Tunisia. During their first sortie, 22 C.205 clashed with very good results against more numerous formations of Curtiss P-40s and Supermarine Spitfires. During the next few months, C.205s of the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; were involved in several major engagements with some of the 4,000 Allied aircraft that were stationed in the Mediterranean at that time.
At the end of May, because of the vulnerability of Pantelleria, the 1° &quot;Stormo&quot; was moved to Sigonella airfield in Sicily and the minor airstrip of Finocchiara, 15 km south-east of Ragusa. On 8 June 1943, 15 C.205s of 1° &quot;Stormo&quot; escorted three torpedo bombers attacking Allied ships which were shelling Pantelleria&#x27;s defenses. At the end of June, the &quot;Stormo&quot; had no more serviceable &quot;Veltros&quot;. On 24 June, 1° &quot;Stormo&quot; left Sicily for Osoppo, then later Ronchi dei Legionari, and was replaced by 4° &quot;Stormo&quot;. Few pilots returned to Udine, while the remaining aircraft joined other units.

4° &quot;Stormo&quot;, which had left Africa in January 1943, was re-equipped with C.202s and C.205s on the airfields of Campoformido (10° &quot;Gruppo&quot;) and Bresso (9° &quot;Gruppo&quot;). It was then moved to Rome-Ciampino airport. On 9 July 1943 (the eve of the Allied invasion of Sicily), 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; was based on the Catania plain, with a complement of 10 &quot;Veltros&quot; and 38 &quot;Folgores&quot; (no Italian unit was equipped with &quot;Veltros&quot; alone). Later it received a batch of a further 10 C.205s. The Italian pilots flew as many as six sorties per day, but on 14 July, with the first Allied paratroopers landing on the Catania plain, 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; was forced to retreat to Crotone airfield in Calabria after setting fire to four or five damaged C.205s that could not be repaired in time.

51° &quot;Stormo&quot; fought with some success over Sardinia (apart from the battle of 2 August), but sustained heavy losses, especially at the end of July and the beginning of August.
3° Stormo C.T., commanded by &quot;Tenente Colonnello&quot; Tito Falconi, also had the opportunity to fly the &quot;Veltro&quot; in combat. At the time it was based at Cerveteri airstrip, with the task of defending Rome, 83ª, 85ª and 95ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot;, 18° &quot;Gruppo&quot; (of 3° &quot;Stormo&quot;) all received a number of C.205s. Commander Falconi assigned them to the most eminent pilots: &quot;Sergente Maggiore&quot; Luigi Gorrini, &quot;Tenente&quot; Franco Bordoni-Bisleri and &quot;Maresciallo&quot; Guido Fibbia.
3° &quot;Stormo&quot; used the new type effectively to intercept American bombers and fighters in the skies over Latium.
&quot;The Macchi fighter possessed some excellent qualities, and the Italian pilots made optimum use of the aircraft which had a maximum speed of .&quot;

One of the greatest British fighter pilots of the Second World War, Group Captain Duncan-Smith DSO DFC, respected both the C.205 and the Italian airmen who flew it:
Like its predecessors, the first &quot;Veltros&quot; were insufficiently armed, but the aircraft often performed well in combat. Guido Carestiato said the C.205 was the &quot;best Italian fighter that he knew&quot;. The C.205 ace Luigi Gorrini scored 19 or 24 victories (in return, he was downed four or five times). Gorrini claimed 12 victories in July 1943, several of them with the &quot;Veltro&quot;.

===Battle of Pantelleria===

1° &quot;Stormo&quot; received the first &quot;Veltros&quot; in time to fight over the southern Italian air base. In free-ranging patrols, the wing fielded 24 &quot;Veltros&quot; (around 1/10 of all those produced) and nine Folgores in an attempt to intercept enemy aircraft in the area.
While patrolling between Cap Bon and Cap Mustafà on 20 April 1943, Italian fighters spotted a large enemy formation west of Pantelleria. The Italians started to close in to the aircraft of Nos. 1, 92, 417, and 601 SAAF Squadrons, which were flying at low level, but were surprised by six Polish pilots of 145 Squadron flying high cover. These were joined by other Spitfires, and the 33 Macchis found themselves in combat with up to 60 Spitfires (mainly Mk VCs, and possibly Mk VIIIs and IXs). The Italian pilots claimed 15 victories (one by &quot;Maresciallo&quot; Baschirotto, who fired 500 rounds), with 14 Spitfires downed in the sea and another over African soil.

However, another analysis of this combat shows that the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; pilots claimed a total of 17 aircraft on 20 April and claimed to have downed 15 Spitfires in this engagement; although Italian ground observers claimed to have seen 14 aircraft crash into the sea or onto land, only one Spitfire, flown by Flg Off Drecki of 145 Sqn, was heavily damaged. In return, three C.205Vs were lost. There is also a possibility that Bf 109s of I./JG77 were involved in this engagement.

Allied records report only two C.205Vs downed (&quot;Tenenti&quot; Andreoli and Fanelli), while another made an emergency landing near Cap Bon, and explains why some sources quote two losses and others three, but there is some doubt as to whether this aircraft, the only one to touch down on African soil, was a &quot;Veltro&quot; or a &quot;Folgore&quot;. At least one other Macchi was damaged, and the pilot wounded. Similarly, the Italian claims did not match any losses recorded in Allied squadron reports.

===Battle of Capo Pula===
On 2 August 1943, two British Beaufighters were downed and the Italians sent a CANT Z.506 &quot;Airone&quot; aircraft escorted by four C.205Vs on a search-and-rescue mission. A group of P-40s attacked the Z.506, but despite the defence put up by the &quot;Veltros&quot;, one American fighter crashed into the Z.506 and both fell into the sea.

A USAAF search and rescue PBY Catalina mission was also mounted, escorted by 12 P-38s. C.202 and C.205s of 51° &quot;Stormo&quot;, led by Ennio Tarantola, intercepted this flight. The Catalina was taken by surprise on the surface near the Sardinian coast, having broken a propeller blade in the heavy sea conditions. The Italians also claimed to have downed all 12 P-38s, whereas the Americans claimed three or four victories over the Axis fighters with no losses. Later records showed that only the Catalina and the C.202 of&quot; Maresciallo&quot; Bianchi, a close friend of Tarantola, had been shot down.

The two or three victories over P-38s claimed by Tarantola are not supported by any data available; however, no further SAR missions were made by Americans to search for the downed pilots. Except for a crewman killed by strafing, the crew of the Catalina was saved, thanks to a fast vessel of the Royal Navy whose captain was awarded the DSC for battling adverse sea conditions, coastal battery fire and enemy aircraft while rescuing the survivors.

===Defence of Rome===
In mid 1943, Gorrini obtained one of the three C.205s delivered to the 3° Stormo (the other two were assigned to other aces, &quot;Tenente &quot;Franco Bordoni Bisleri and &quot;Maresciallo&quot; Guido Fibbia). In six weeks, during the &quot;Difesa di Roma&quot;, Gorrini became the top scoring C.205 pilot; by the Armistice, he had claimed three Consolidated B-24 Liberators, three Lockheed P-38 Lightnings (three damaged), two B-17s and two Spitfires.

Given the shortage of modern aircraft, the more advanced combat aircraft, such as the &quot;Veltros&quot;, were usually given to the best flyers and most experienced pilots like Vittorio Minguzzi.

===After the Armistice===
At the time of the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces on 8 September 1943, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; had received 177 &quot;Veltros&quot;, but only 66 were still usable. Six of these flew to Allied airfields to serve with the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force.

===Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana===
A total of 29 C.205s reached northern airfields and were used by the Italian Social Republic Air Force (ANR – &quot;Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana&quot;).

Macchi produced the remaining 72 aircraft of the third series for the ANR before production was shut down by Allied bombing in May 1944. Statistics on aircraft production post-Armistice are unclear and incomplete.
In general, C.205s fought well in RSI service: they were attached to units that had homogeneous equipment, or at least of comparable quality, and were guided by German radar stations. Though few in number, they achieved success in inflicting losses on Allied bombers and fighters.
The first air battle of the &quot;Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; – still with German insignia – took place on 3 January 1944. The C.205s, guided by Italian ace &quot;Capitano&quot; Adriano Visconti, intercepted a formation of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses and their escort of Lockheed P-38 Lightnings bombing RIV factories in Villar Perosa.
On 24 January, the Macchi 205 were transferred to two bases in Friuli. On 28 January, the C.205s, now with Italian markings, succeeded in shooting down a B-24 Liberator, their first four-engined American bomber. This air victory was credited to &quot;Sergente&quot; Marconcini, wingman of the ace Visconti.

1° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, based in Udine, was equipped with a few &quot;Veltros&quot;. According to one author:
A few &quot;Veltros&quot; were also delivered to 3° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, based in Vicenza, while further &quot;Veltros&quot; were scattered throughout other small units. 

&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; also had a poor opinion about the C.205N, plagued by overheating in the climb.
The 1° &quot;Gruppo&quot; C.T. of the ANR, based at the Campoformido airfield, was equipped with C.205. Its first operation, on 3 January, began with a surprise blow right away: the Italian fighter pilots shot down four P-38 Lightnings. By 25 February, 1° &quot;Gruppo&quot; C.T. had reported 26 victories for nine losses. An extremely bitter aerial combat took place on 11 March. The Italians claimed 12 victories for themselves, but lost three of their own pilots, including 1st Lt Boscutti, who was killed by an American P-38 Lightning pilot after he had bailed out from his stricken fighter and was hanging from his parachute. On 18 March, 30 C.205s from 1° &quot;Gruppo&quot; C.T. and 60 Bf 109 from JG.77 joined combat with about 450 Allied bombers and their escorts, shooting down at least four enemy aircraft, but Corp. Zaccaria was killed while hanging from his parachute again by a P-38 pilot who fired at him from close range.
Allied bombing in April 1944 destroyed most of the Macchi and Fiat facilities bringing fighter production to an end. With the interruption of production, the Italians were forced to re-equip their three groups almost fully with Bf 109s, largely because the Germans were quick to offer some of their best models, including Bf 109G-6s and Bf 109K-4s. The Allies were less generous with the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force (ICAF), and &quot;Veltros&quot;, including some upgraded C.202s, were slowly replaced with worn-out P-39s and Spitfires, but not before summer 1944.

=== In Luftwaffe service ===
Luftwaffe II.Gruppe of JG 77 operated with requisitioned C.205Vs for two months, from October until December 1943, when the German unit was re-equipped with new Bf 109s. Thus there are photos of C.205s with black crosses painted over the mid-fuselage Italian white stripe markings. The Germans were less enthusiastic about the C.205Vs, nor were they really impressed by the early evaluations in spring of 1943. There is mention in the KTB (History diary) on 25 November 1943 page: &quot;the group has 23 Macchi, 11 are ready to fight. Macchi is fast and had a good flying characteristics, except for the tendency to lose control in sharp turns. The fighter is disadvantaged because its radio, while powerful, is far from reliable in action. Refueling and rearming process is slow and difficult, it takes much time to make the fighters ready. Today&#x27;s mission was made with 17 Macchis, radio control problems caused delays, and the mission concluded without intercepting the enemy.&quot;
In the brief German use, Veltros had at least five losses by accidents, often caused by the inverted throttle used on Italian aircraft (In German and Allied fighters the &quot;open throttle&quot; position was forward, not back, and this was the source of several errors). The first losses occurred on 27 September 1943 near Albenga. Two German pilots were killed and other wounded in these accidents. On the other side, it was recorded only one aerial combat in which Germans claimed at least one P-38 and two probable (1 December 1943).

After II.JG 77 was equipped with new Bf 109s, the C.205s were sent to Italian units. Some Veltros were ferried by JG 53.

=== In Croatian Service ===
A small batch of C.205s were in service with the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia, &quot;Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske&quot; (ZNDH) in 1944, but the Croatian &quot;Veltros&quot; flew few sorties and were soon overwhelmed by the waves of Allied fighters that swarmed over Yugoslavian skies. On 30 June 1944, three recently arrived C.205s, flown by Eastern Front veterans (Major Josip Helebrant, Oberleutenant Ljudevit &quot;Lujo&quot; Bencetic and Feldwebel Bozidar &quot;Bosko&quot; Bartulovic), along with three inexperienced pilots in C.202s, took off to intercept USAAF Fifteenth Air force bombers heading to bomb Blechhammer, location of Nazi Germany chemical plants, prisoner of war (POW) camps, and forced labor camps. The Macchis attacked the USAAF bombers and their escorting fighters, 5th FS/52nd FG P-51 Mustangs over Bjelovar, but five of the Italian-built aircraft were shot down both by the bomber&#x27;s defensive fire and by the Mustangs. Only Bencetic – an ace with a final score of 15 kills and his &quot;Veltro&quot; succeeded in returning to base at Zagreb. Helebrant and Bartulovic bailed out and survived the war, with a final score of, respectively, 11 and eight kills.

===Postwar===

Production of the C.205 continued in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War; the Aeronautica Militare Italiana (AMI) proceeded to take delivery of Macchi-built C.205s until late 1948. Nor would the AMI be the sole customer of the type.

During 1948–1949, Egypt received 62 refurbished C.205Vs, of which 41 were converted from C.202 airframes. In May 1948, eight C.205V and 16 C.202 were upgraded and in February 1949, three brand new and 15 ex-MC.202, and in May another 10 MC.205 and 10 MC.202 were upgraded. This last contract was not finalized and, given the end of the 1948 Arab Israeli War (1948–49), the fighters were delivered to the AMI instead. Egypt also ordered 19 G.55s and Syria another 16, all new-built.

The new &quot;Veltros&quot; were fully equipped, while the &quot;Folgore&quot; conversions were armed with only two 12.7 mm Breda machine guns. They were the lightest series of the entire production, and consequently had the best performance, but were seriously under-armed. A total of 15 Macchis were delivered to Egypt before the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, seeing brief combat against the Israeli Air Force. Some Veltros, equipped with underwing bomb racks were used in ground-attack sorties against Israeli targets. On 7 January 1949, a C.205 claimed an Israeli P-51D Mustang. In return, two or three Veltros had been claimed by IAF fighters by the end of the war in July, with another six under repair.

Israeli secret services reacted with a bombing in Italy, which at the time was supplying both Israel and the Arab states. On 15 February 1947, an SM.95 airliner was destroyed, possibly by sabotage, soon after takeoff from Rome. On board were an Egyptian princess, several politicians and an Italian intelligence officer. A subsequent bombing was at Venegono on 18 September 1948; one hangar was damaged by several explosive devices, destroying three MB.308 and one MC.205 in Macchi facilities. The hangar, not totally demolished, contained several Veltros destined for Egypt. All the G.55s ordered by Egypt were armed with four Breda (12.7 mm) machine-guns, and they were brand new; 16 were single-seaters and three were twin-seaters. Syria ordered sixteen G.55A; all single-seaters.

The MM/Snc were: Macchi first batch: 1201–1224; second batch, 1225–1242. Fiat G.55A were 91214–91220, 91225–91229, 91221-91224 (G.55B two-seats).

During 1951, the final batch of Veltros were delivered, the fighter serving mainly with No.2 Sqn until the mid-1950s. The last batch, 20 Veltros (10 ex-MC.202, six Veltro sr.III and 4 sr.I) were assigned to AMI with deliveries continuing until 29 May 1951. The phasing out process was however swift, because the new Anglo-American jet fighters were available at a surprisingly low cost at the time of the official phasing out of the Veltro (around 1951), although the last MC.205 was phased out in 1955. The &quot;Folgore&quot; was stricken off register in 1948, with the exception of those C.202 airframes transformed into Veltros.

== An Allied test pilot&#x27;s opinion ==
Captain Eric Brown, Chief Naval Test Pilot and commanding officer of the Royal Aircraft Establishment&#x27;s Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight, remembered how impressed the members of the unit were when they tested the Veltro. &quot;One of the finest aircraft I ever flew was the Macchi MC. 205. Oh, beautiful. And here you had the perfect combination of Italian styling and German engineering. I believe it was powered by a Daimler Benz DB 605. It was really a delight to fly, and up to anything on the Allied programme. But again, it came just before the Italians capitulated so it was never used extensively. And we did tests on it and were most impressed. The cockpit was smallish but not as bad as the Bf 109.&quot;

==Variants==
With limited production and service life, the C.205 saw only a few modifications. After the first 100 examples, the wing-mounted 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns were replaced with a couple of 20 mm MG 151 cannon.
;M.C.205
:One prototype armed with two 12.7 mm (0.5 in) and two 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine guns.
;M.C.205V
:Main production version.
;M.C.205S
:Long-range escort fighter with a 200 L (53 US gal) fuel tank replacing the fuselage machine guns; 18 converted from production aircraft.
;M.C.205N
:Proposed DB 605-powered fighter with a more significant design revision than the C.202-derived C.205V. The aircraft had a new wing with the wingspan increased to and wing area increased to , and a lengthened fuselage that brought the length to 9.65 m. Also, the fuselage was finally adapted for a 20 mm MG 151 cannon. The heavier weight resulted in decreased performance and handling.
;M.C.205N-1
:High-altitude interceptor fighter prototype. Armed with four 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine guns mounted in the fuselage, and one 20 mm cannon mounted in the engine.
;M.C.205N-2 &quot;Orione&quot;
:High-altitude interceptor fighter prototype. Armed with three 20 mm cannon and two 12.7 mm (0.5 in) machine guns. The machine gun bulges were replaced by a streamlined fairing.
;M.C.206
:Similar armament to the C.205N/1 with a larger yet lighter wing (21  m2). Reduced weight resulting in performances similar to that of the C.205V again. The larger wing would have enabled it to fight at higher altitudes. Single prototype destroyed by Allied bombing before being completed.
;M.C.207
:Powered by a Daimler-Benz DB 603 engine. Other than that, similar to C.206 but with armament of four 20 mm cannon, none built.

==Operators==
*&quot;Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske&quot; received 4 aircraft.
* Royal Egyptian Air Force
**No.2 Squadron REAF
*&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;
**II/JG 77 operated 25 aircraft.
*&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;
* Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force received 6 aircraft.
*&quot;Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana&quot; received 101 aircraft.
* Italian Air Force operated some Macchi C.205 until 1947
* Royal Australian Air Force One Macchi MC.205V Serie 1 was captured intact by Australians on Pachino Airfield, in Sicily, Summer 1943. It was a MC.205 of First Series without the cannons in the wing, but armed with two 12,7mm machine guns in engine cowling synchronized with the propeller and two 7,7mm machine guns on the wings.

==Survivors==
Three Veltros survive today, one of which was restored to flying condition and participated in numerous aerial displays until the end of 1986.
All C.205s that are preserved are hybrids made up of parts of C.202s mixed with those of C.205s.

One, &quot;MM.91818&quot; (bearing the registration MM 9327), is on display at the National Museum of Science and Technology in Milan. Restoration was completed in 1981 by the Italian Air Force together with Fiat and Aermacchi.

Another two are on display at the Museo storico dell&#x27;Aeronautica Militare in Vigna di Valle.
&quot;MM.9546&quot; is displayed as a MC.205 and &quot;MM.92166&quot; is displayed as a MC.202.

In November 2006 the engine and cockpit of a crashed C.205 were found 8 meters underground, with the pilot still in his seat, in Correzzola.

A C.205 replica can be seen outside Rome&#x27;s Palazzo dell&#x27;Aeronautica, and another in Volandia Park and Museum of Flight at Vizzola Ticino.

<doc id="176531" wikidata="Q198712" url="?curid=176531" title="Culture of Iraq">
<text>The culture of Iraq (Arabic: ثقافة العراق) or the culture of Mesopotamia is one of the world&#x27;s oldest cultural histories and is considered one of the most influential cultures in the world. The region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, historically known as Mesopotamia, is often referred to as the cradle of civilisation. Mesopotamian legacy went on to influence and shape the civilizations of the Old World in different ways such as inventing writing, mathematics, law, astrology and many more fields. Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups who have contributed to the wide spectrum of the Iraqi Culture. The country is known for its poets، architects، painters and sculptors who are among the best in the region, some of them being world-class. The country has one of the longest written traditions in the world including architecture, literature, music, dance, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, stonemasonry and metalworking.

Additionally, Iraq embraces and celebrates the achievements of its past in pre-Islamic times as well as in Islamic times during Islamic Golden Age when Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate.

== Art ==
Iraq&#x27;s art has a deep heritage that extends back in time to ancient times and refers to all works of visual art originating from the geographical region since ancient Mesopotamian periods. Mesopotamian art include favourite subjects such as deities, either alone or with worshippers, and animals in several types of scenes: repeated in rows, single, fighting each other or a human, confronted animals by themselves or flanking a human or god in the Master of Animals motif, or a Tree of Life.

During the Abbasid Caliphate, which ruled from the heartland of Mesopotamia, pottery achieved a high level of sophistication, calligraphy began to be used to decorate the surface of decorative objects and illuminated manuscripts, particularly Q&#x27;ranic texts became more complex and stylised. Iraq&#x27;s first art school was established during this period, allowing artisans and crafts to flourish. Famous Abbasid artist include Yahya Al-Wasiti who lived in Baghdad in the late Abbasid era (12th to 13th-centuries) and was the pre-eminent artist of the Baghdad school. His most well-known works include the illustrations for the book of the &quot;Maqamat&quot; (Assemblies) in 1237, a series of anecdotes of social satire written by al-Hariri. Al-Waiti&#x27;s illustrations served as an inspiration for the 20th-century modern Baghdad art movement.

== Languages ==
The main languages spoken in Iraq are Mesopotamian Arabic and Kurdish, followed by the Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman dialect of Turkish, and the Neo-Aramaic languages (specifically Sureth). Arabic and Kurdish are written with versions of the Arabic script. Since 2005, the Turkmen/Turkoman have switched from the Arabic script to the Turkish alphabet.

In addition, the Neo-Aramaic languages use the Syriac script. Other smaller minority languages include Mandaic, English, Shabaki and Armenian.

According to the Constitution of Iraq (Article 4):

: The Arabic language and the Kurdish language are the two official languages of Iraq. The right of Iraqis to educate their children in their mother tongue, such as Turkmen, Syriac, and Armenian shall be guaranteed in government educational institutions in accordance with educational guidelines, or in any other language in private educational institutions.

=== Ancient ===
Sumerian (𒅴𒂠 &quot;EME.G̃IR15&quot; &quot;native tongue&quot;) was the language of ancient Sumer and a language isolate that was spoken in Mesopotamia (Iraq). The Sumerian language is the earliest known written language. The &quot;proto-literate&quot; period of Sumerian writing spans c. 3300 to 3000 BC. In this period, records are purely logographic, with phonological content. The oldest document of the proto-literate period is the Kish tablet. Falkenstein (1936) lists 939 signs used in the proto-literate period (late Uruk, 34th to 31st centuries).
During the 3rd millennium BC, an intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Semitic-speaking Akkadians, which included widespread bilingualism. The influence of Sumerian and the East Semitic language Akkadian on each other is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a substantial scale to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence. This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium BC as a &quot;Sprachbund&quot;.

== Literature ==
=== Pre-Islamic ===
Sumerian literature constitutes the earliest known corpus of recorded literature, including the religious writings and other traditional stories maintained by the Sumerian civilization and largely preserved by the later Akkadian and Babylonian empires. These records were written in the Sumerian language during the Middle Bronze Age.

The Sumerians invented one of the first writing systems, developing Sumerian cuneiform writing out of earlier proto-writing systems by about the 30th century BC. The Sumerian language remained in official and literary use in the Akkadian and Babylonian empires, even after the spoken language disappeared from the population; literacy was widespread, and the Sumerian texts that students copied heavily influenced later Babylonian literature.

==== Poetry ====
Poetry is the most dominant form of literature in Iraq and the country is known for having notable poets.

An ancient Mesopotamian poem gives the first known story of the invention of writing:Because the messenger&#x27;s mouth was heavy and he couldn&#x27;t repeat [the message], the Lord of Kulaba patted some clay and put words on it, like a tablet. Until then, there had been no putting words on clay.

— Sumerian epic poem &quot;Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta&quot;. Circa 1800 BC

Gilgamesh (Sumerian: 𒀭𒄑𒉋𒂵𒈨𒌋𒌋𒌋, &quot;Gilgameš&quot;; originally Sumerian: 𒀭𒉋𒂵𒈩, &quot;Bilgamesh&quot;) was a major hero in ancient Mesopotamian mythology and the protagonist of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh.&quot;

The Epic of Gilgamesh () is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia, regarded as the earliest surviving notable literature. The literary history of Gilgamesh begins with five Sumerian poems about Bilgamesh (Sumerian for &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;), king of Uruk, dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2100 BCE). These independent stories were later used as source material for a combined epic in Akkadian. The first surviving version of this combined epic, known as the &quot;Old Babylonian&quot; version dates to the 18th century BCE and is titled after its incipit, Shūtur eli sharrī (&quot;Surpassing All Other Kings&quot;). Only a few tablets of it have survived. The later Standard Babylonian version compiled by Sîn-lēqi-unninni dates from the 13th to the 10th centuries BCE and bears the incipit Sha naqba īmuru(&quot;He who Saw the Abyss&quot;, in modern terms: &quot;He who Sees the Unknown&quot;). Approximately two-thirds of this longer, twelve-tablet version have been recovered. Some of the best copies were discovered in the library ruins of the 7th-century BC Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.
=== Post-Islamic ===
During the Abbasid Caliphate, the well established tradition of poetry continued to be the most dominant form of literature. In addition, Abbasid literature was characterized by the emergence of many new genres and of a scholarly and sophisticated critical consciousness.

Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center of the Muslim world. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom, as well as hosting a multiethnic and multireligious environment, garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the &quot;Centre of Learning&quot;.

=== Contemporary ===
Some of the most important figures of 20th century Iraqi literature include, Safa Khulusi Maruf Rusafi and Daisy Al-Amir, Jamil Zahawi, Jawahiri and Khazal al Majidi.

==Architecture==
The ancient architecture of Mesopotamia, encompassing several distinct cultures and spanning a period from the 10th millennium BC, when the first permanent structures were built in the 6th century BC. Among the Mesopotamian architectural accomplishments are the development of urban planning, the courtyard house, and ziggurats. No architectural profession existed in Mesopotamia; however, scribes drafted and managed construction for the government, nobility, or royalty. The local architecture of Iraq was often based on vernacular architecture inherited from one generation to the next. Since the Iraqi society is composed of multicultural social groups with different architectural heritage, therefore, old Iraqi cities have several types architecture and urban forms.

Iraq is known for having world-class architects, such as Zaha Hadid, Rifat Chadirji and Hisham N. Ashkouri among others.

== Cinema ==
While Iraq&#x27;s first film projection took place in 1909, cinema was not truly regarded as a cultural activity or pastime until the 1920s. The first cinemas, like the famous al-Zawra cinema on Baghdad&#x27;s bustling thoroughfare al-Rashid, played mostly American silent films for British citizens. In the 1940s under the rule of King Faisal II of Iraq, a real Iraqi cinema began. Supported by British and French financiers, movie production companies established themselves in Baghdad. The Baghdad Studio was established in 1948, but soon came apart when tensions between the Arab and Jewish founders flared up. For the most part, the product was purely commercial, fluffy romances with plenty of singing and dancing often set in small villages. The World of Arts (Dunyat Alfann) studio, which was founded by actors, reached for more serious fare. In 1955, they produced Haidar Al-Omar&#x27;s Fitna wa Hassan, an Iraqi retelling of Romeo and Juliet, that received international attention. But for the most part, the strong-fist rule of the state discouraged any socially relevant films. In 1959 when King Faisel II&#x27;s government was overthrown, the Cinema and Theater General organization came into existence with the purpose of promoting the political goals of the new regime both in documentaries and features. Typical were documentaries like the 1969 Al Maghishi Project, which showcased the government&#x27;s irrigation campaigns and the 1967 A Wedding in Heaven, which celebrates the air force and their weapons system. The 1968 revolution that put the Ba&#x27;ath party in power further solidified the government&#x27;s control of film material, and the state&#x27;s need to make all films validate its power.

Saddam Hussein&#x27;s ascension to power in 1979 pushed the Iraqi cinema in a slightly different direction. The drain on national resources from the 1980 Iraq-Iran war brought film production to a near halt. The few films put into production were mainly intent on glorifying a mythic Iraqi history or celebrating Hussein&#x27;s rule. In 1981, the government commissioned Egyptian filmmaker Salah Abouseif to make Al-Qadisiya, a period epic recounting the triumph of the Arabs over the Persians in 636 AD. Likewise Mohamed Shukri Jameel&#x27;s melodramatic The Great Question (al-Mas&#x27; Ala Al-Kubra) cast British actor Oliver Reed as the vicious Lt-Col Gerard Leachman who is righteously killed in the 1920 Iraqi revolution. In 1980 Hussein promoted his own mythology with the autobiographical 6-hour epic The Long Days (al-Ayyam al-tawila), the saga of Hussein&#x27;s participation in the 1958 failed assassination attempt on Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, and his subsequent heroic escape back to Tikrit. The film was edited and partially directed by Terence Young, the British director who made his name helming the early James Bond films Dr. No and Thunderball (film). Hussein is played by Saddam Kamel, a cousin and son-in-law of Hussein&#x27;s, who eventually ran afoul of the dictator and was murdered in 1996. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, sanctions against Iraq made filmmaking an impossibility in the country, although a new generation of filmmakers is coming alive in Baghdad.

==Music==

Iraq is known primarily for its rich maqam heritage which has been passed down orally by the masters of the maqam in an unbroken chain of transmission,

leading up to the present. The maqam al-Iraqi is considered to be the most noble and perfect form of maqam. Al-maqam al-Iraqi is the collection of sung,

poems written either in one of the sixteen meters of classical Arabic or in Iraqi dialect (Zuhayri).

This Form of art is recognised by UNESCO as &quot;an intangible heritage of humanity&quot;.

==Sport==

Football is the most well known sport in Iraq. The Iraq national football team were the 2007 AFC Asian Cup Champions after defeating Saudi Arabia in the final, held in Jakarta, Indonesia. In 2006, Iraq reached the football final of the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, after defeating former FIFA World Cup semi-finalists South Korea and eventually finished as runners-up, winning silver. The football tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, saw Iraq finish in fourth place, with the Italy national football team claiming bronze from a single goal.

The Iraqi Football Association () is the governing body of football in Iraq, controlling the Iraq national football team and the Iraq Super League (also known as Dawri Al-Nokba). It was founded in 1948, and has been a member of FIFA since 1950, and the Asian Football Confederation since 1971.

It was founded in 1948, and has been a member of FIFA since 1950, and the Asian Football Confederation since 1971. Big clubs in Iraq include Al-Shorta, Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, Al-Zawraa, Erbil SC, Duhok SC, Al Talaba and Najaf FC. Basketball, swimming, weightlifting, bodybuilding, boxing, kickboxing, and tennis are also popular sports.

==Cuisine==
Iraqi cuisine or Mesopotamian cuisine has a long history going back some 10,000 years – to the Sumerians, Babylonians, Assyrians,

and Ancient Persians. Tablets found in ancient ruins in Iraq show recipes prepared in the temples during religious festivals - the first cookbooks in the world. Ancient Iraq, or &quot;Mesopotamia was&quot; home to a sophisticated and highly advanced civilization, in all fields of knowledge - including the culinary arts.

However, it was in the Islamic Golden Age when Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate that the Iraqi kitchen reached its zenith. Today, the cuisine of Iraq reflects this rich inheritance, as well as strong influences from the culinary traditions of neighbouring Persia, Turkey, and the Syria region. Some popular dishes include &quot;Kebab&quot; (often marinated with garlic, lemon, and spices, then grilled), &quot;Gauss&quot; (grilled meat sandwich wrap, similar to &quot;Döner kebab&quot;), &quot;Bamieh&quot; (lamb, okra, and tomato stew), &quot;Quzi&quot; (lamb with rice, almonds, raisins, and spices), and salad in &quot;pita&quot;, &quot;Kubbah&quot; (minced meat ground with bulghur wheat, or rice and spices), &quot;Masgûf&quot; (grilled fish with pepper and tamarind), and &quot;Maqluba&quot; (a rice, lamb, tomato, and aubergine dish). Stuffed vegetable dishes such as &quot;Dolma&quot; and &quot;Mahshi&quot; are also popular. Machbous is also a popular dish in the south and south east of Iraq.

Contemporary Iraq reflects the same natural division as ancient Mesopotamia, which consisted of Assyria in the arid northern uplands and Babylonia in the southern alluvial plain. &quot;Al-Jazira&quot; (the ancient Assyria) grows wheat and crops requiring winter chill such as apples and stone fruits. &quot;Al-Irāq&quot; (Iraq proper, the ancient Babylonia) grows rice and barley, citrus fruits, and is responsible for Iraq&#x27;s position as the world&#x27;s largest producer of dates.

&quot;Kitab al-tabikh&quot; is the oldest surviving Arabic cookbook, written by al-Warraq in the 10th century. It is compiled from the recipes of the 8th and 9th century courts of the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad. Some scholars speculate that al-Warraq may have prepared the manuscript on behalf of a patron, the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Dawla, who sought to improve the cultural prestige of his own court in Aleppo as the court in Baghdad had started to decline.

==Contemporary culture==

===Cultural heritage===
Iraq is a country of a wide and varied heritage, home to religious groups such as Muslims, Christians, Jews, Mandaaeans, Yazidis, and ethnic groups such as Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen who have contributed to the wide spectrum of Iraqi Culture. Many markets reflect local culture and economy such as the famous Al-Safafeer market in Baghdad which is one of the oldest markets in the city established during the Abbasid Caliphate and remains famous for various copper collectables and exhibits.

Tea houses are scattered throughout Iraq, and in the afternoon, it is a habit for shopkeepers to retreat into the back with close friends to sip tea over gossip, an Iraqi &quot;siesta&quot;.

===Cultural institutions===

Some important cultural institutions in the capital include the Iraqi National Orchestra (rehearsals and performances were briefly interrupted during the Occupation of Iraq, but have since returned to normal) and the National Theatre of Iraq (the theatre was looted during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, but efforts are underway to restore the theatre). The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s, when UN sanctions limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of comedies and dramatic productions.

Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include the Academy of Music, Institute of Fine Arts, and the Music and Ballet school Baghdad. Baghdad also features a number of museums including the National Museum of Iraq - which houses the world&#x27;s largest and finest collection of artifacts and relics of Ancient Iraq civilizations; some of which were stolen during the Iraq War.

=== Festivals ===
Some cultural events are celebrating the Iraqi culture over time. The Iraq&#x27;s Babylon International Festival is promoting arts including dance and music, hosting thousands of Iraqi visitors. It experienced a break of 19 years, since the American invasion, but was organized again since 2021. The international event founded in 1987, gathers artists coming from all around the world. In 2022 the city of Mosul hosted the festival of traditional music, supported by UNESCO. Organizers of the event expressed their will to perpetuate this festival in the future and to organize an edition each year.

<text>John Frederick Lange Jr. (born June 3, 1931) is an American writer who, as John Norman, has authored the &quot;Gor&quot; series of science fantasy novels. Norman was also a philosophy professor.

== Early life and education ==
Lange was born in Chicago, Illinois, to John Frederick Lange and Almyra D. Lange (née Taylor).

He began his academic career in the early 1950s, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Nebraska in 1953, and his Master of Arts degree from the University of Southern California in 1957. 

==Personal life==
Lange married Bernice L. Green on January 14, 1956 while he was still a student at USC. The couple have three children: John, David, and Jennifer.

== Academic career ==
Lange earned his PhD in 1963 from Princeton University. His dissertation was named: &quot;In defence of ethical naturalism: an examination of certain aspects of naturalistic fallacy, with particular attention to the logic of an open question argument&quot;. Lange summed it up in an interview by saying &quot;if one cannot make sense of morality within some sort of satisfying, natural context, then one is likely to end up with no morality, which is less than societally reassuring, or is likely to end up with a competitive plethora of moralities in which ninety-nine percent of the world&#x27;s population is convinced that the other ninety-nine percent is unclean, stupid, uninformed, vicious, depraved, in need of coercive correction, and such. That too, seems less than reassuring.&quot;

He was a professor at Queens College of the City University of New York before retirement.

== Writing career ==
Norman&#x27;s fiction attained popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s with an estimated 6 to 12 million copies sold.

John Norman&#x27;s Gorean Saga is a long-running series of adventure science fantasy novels, starting in December 1966 with &quot;Tarnsman of Gor&quot;. The series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment, &quot;Magicians of Gor&quot;, in 1988, when DAW refused to publish its successor, &quot;Witness of Gor&quot;. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet, the series was brought back into print in 2001 with the publication of &quot;Witness of Gor&quot;. Norman has also produced a separate science fiction series, the &quot;Telnarian Histories&quot;, plus three other fiction works, five non-fiction works, and a collection of thirty short stories.

Norman has said that the three major influences on his work are Homer, Freud, and Nietzsche.

== Themes ==
According to Norman, his Gor books are science fiction or adventure fantasy works which are also &quot;intellectual, philosophical, and psychological novels&quot;. His fiction depicts fantastic worlds where male-dominated bondage relationships are natural and widely practiced and respected culturally, whereas characteristics of modern society are criticized and philosophical themes are explored, especially from a Nietzschean view.

Although the bondage in his &quot;Imaginative Sex&quot; guide is directed to sexual practices, the bondage and slavery presented on &quot;Gor&quot; follows along the lines of societal or legal slavery; a common way of life as reflected in ancient Rome and other societies. While the philosophy presented is unquestionably that of male dominance, male characters are themselves occasionally enslaved by powerful females. In an interview with &quot;Polygraff&quot; magazine, Norman stated that he believes that it is obvious that all societies are based on dominance and hierarchy.

Despite his books being associated with BDSM, Norman is openly critical of the community. In a 2011 interview with Gizmodo, he stated, &quot;I dissociate myself from BDSM, at least as I understand it. I may, of course, misunderstand it. I wonder if one would settle merely for &#x27;real-life Gorean slavery&#x27;, because, as I understand it, BDSM is not Gorean. If something is not beautiful, it is not Gorean.&quot;

His non-fiction works cover philosophy, ethics and historiography.

=== Gorean subculture ===
A fandom based on his &quot;Gor&quot; novels, known as the Gorean subculture, has developed without Lange&#x27;s direct involvement. Scholars have discussed the way that Gorean subculture groups on media such as IMVU, &quot;Second Life&quot;, and Internet Relay Chat have influenced the development of online role-playing and even the MMORPG genre.

<doc id="176535" wikidata="Q1203417" url="?curid=176535" title="Eagle (automobile)">
<text>Eagle was a brand of the Chrysler Corporation following the purchase of American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987 and marketed through the end of the 1998 model year. It was aimed at the enthusiast driver and promoted as more &quot;European&quot; than the automaker&#x27;s similar models.

Chrysler took the &quot;Eagle&quot; name from the four-wheel drive AMC Eagle models that were introduced for the 1980 model year. This was the last of American Motors&#x27; wholly U.S.-designed vehicles, and they have since been described as the first modern mass-production crossover vehicles produced in the U.S. because the &quot;crossover&quot; term had not been coined.

The Eagle name also appeared on several Jeep trim packages and unique models that included the J-10 pickup trucks, the wide-track Cherokee SJ, as well as the CJ-5 and CJ-7 models starting in 1976. American Motors also launched an entirely new front-wheel-drive sedan, the Eagle Premier that was developed with Renault, AMC&#x27;s French partner before Chrysler purchased AMC.

Various imported and domestic-built vehicles were marketed, primarily by former AMC dealers along with Jeep products, until the brand was discontinued in 1998. The 1993 through 1997 Eagle Vision sedan sold in respectable numbers, with 115,699 built, while the sporty Eagle Talons were made in two generations from 1990 until 1998, with more than 200,000 produced. Most significantly, the Eagle Premier was the basis for Chrysler&#x27;s successful series of &quot;LH&quot; models that were introduced for the 1993 model year.

==Origin==
Following the introduction of General Motors&#x27; Saturn brand automobile, Chrysler promised a similar new brand designed to take Saturn on with innovative design and building methods. A press release by then Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca indicated that the company was working on a car that would be known as the &quot;Liberty&quot; which aimed to achieve significant cost savings. However, these plans never reached fruition. However, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; soon reported that the AMC-developed Premier would replace Chrysler&#x27;s Liberty project attempts at using the K-car platform. The Liberty name was later applied by Chrysler for a Jeep model marketed in the U.S. starting with the 2002 model year, replacing the AMC-designed Cherokee XJ line.

The main objective of Chrysler acquiring American Motors was the long-established Jeep vehicles, but Renault forced the company to take on the contractual obligations of the passenger car models as part of the deal. Another major factor was that, due to state franchise laws, Chrysler could not start selling Jeeps through their existing dealer networks, nor could ex-AMC dealers begin to sell other Chrysler products. Thus, the Eagle marque was born.

Under new ownership, Chrysler quickly discontinued the domestic-built front-wheel drive Alliance and Encore that were developed under Renault (plans by AMC to import the Renault Espace minivan and the Alpine GTA halo car were also scrapped), but continued to build the four-wheel drive AMC Eagle crossover. It was now called Eagle Wagon and marketed into the 1988 model year until production ended in December. This meant the Brampton Assembly (AMC) manufacturing capacity could be used for making more Jeeps. Moreover, Chrysler kept AMC&#x27;s long-established Eagle brand by continuing to import the mid-sized Renault 21 (renamed Eagle Medallion) as well as starting production of the Renault 25-based full-size sedan that was developed by AMC (renamed Eagle Premier).

==Marketing==
To consolidate the marketing and maintain distribution through AMC dealerships following the 1987 acquisition, the Jeep/Eagle division of Chrysler Corporation was formed. Chrysler&#x27;s initial problem was that unlike the Big Three, which had multiple brands under their corporate name, American Motors had sold passenger cars under its corporate initials of &quot;AMC&quot; since 1970. Thus, without having a separate brand from the now-defunct company, Chrysler management looked to re-brand the legacy vehicles inherited by purchasing AMC under the Eagle name instead of trying to fold those outside-designed products into Chrysler&#x27;s existing distribution structure. A limiting factor is that almost all states &quot;have dealership-friendly franchise regulations&quot; that do not allow manufacturers flexibility because the laws provide dealerships territorial exclusivity, including protection from new competition, as well as limit dealership franchise termination to the point that even &quot;gross inefficiency and poor financial condition are not legitimate grounds for termination.&quot;

Two of Eagle&#x27;s first models, the Eagle Premier and the Eagle Medallion, were designed by AMC in cooperation with its former corporate partner (and 46.4 percent owner), Renault. The remainder of the brand&#x27;s cars were rebadged versions of cars sold by other Chrysler Corporation divisions, as well as some captive imports produced by Mitsubishi Motors. At one point, an Eagle variant of Chrysler&#x27;s popular AS platform minivan was in the planning stages, but this variant never made it to market.

Unlike Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth branded automobiles, the Eagle models lacked the Chrysler Corporation &quot;pentastar&quot; logo. Instead, all models prominently featured the Eagle head logo.

Throughout its history, the Eagle brand needed more product recognition, although its Premier was technically more advanced than anything offered by Chrysler. Most of Eagle&#x27;s models were available in Chrysler-Plymouth, Dodge, and Mitsubishi dealerships under different guises. Chrysler was in financial difficulty at the end of the 1980s and did not have the funds to spread to its new automotive division. Moreover, Jeep vehicles were popular and profitable, so most of the division&#x27;s marketing resources flowed to the Jeep product range. Since Jeep&#x27;s products had better recognition and higher profit margins, many dealers emphasized Jeeps. They considered the Eagle line of passenger cars to distract that business. Their sales and service expertise was primarily in the four-wheel drive Jeeps and AMC&#x27;s Eagle all-wheel-drive models.

Furthermore, the dealership network was realigned following Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition of AMC. Some former AMC/Jeep dealers were consolidated with Chrysler-Plymouth franchises. Up to this point, Chrysler-Plymouth outlets needed a sport utility vehicle (SUV) to sell, and adding the Jeep line helped dealers offer customers a range of vehicles in a rapidly growing market segment. The merger may have helped the individual dealerships that signed on. Still, it caused the nascent Eagle division and its largely derivative models to compete unfavorably for attention with Chrysler&#x27;s and Plymouth&#x27;s often similar, but longer-established and better-recognized lines of passenger cars.

==Phase out==
The Eagle brand was phased out in stages. In 1996, Chrysler discontinued the Mitsubishi Mirage-based Eagle Summit, having discontinued the nearly identical Dodge Colt and Plymouth Colt models after the 1994 model year. After a decade of slow sales, Chrysler announced the discontinuation of the Eagle brand in September 1997, and the last 1998 Eagle Talon rolled off the line after that. In 1997, the Eagle Vision was discontinued at the end of its design cycle. However, the similar Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler Concorde were redesigned for 1998 and continued through 2004. Only the Mitsubishi Eclipse-based Eagle Talon remained for 1998, after which it and the Eagle brand were discontinued.

Chrysler had initially planned to redesign the Eagle Vision for 1999. Prototypes were spotted wearing the Eagle logo. Vision production continued into September 1997 to provide dealers with enough stock of the older car to carry them through to the new car&#x27;s introduction. However, Chrysler executives decided to pull the plug on the Eagle brand just a few months later. The car they were working on went on to be marketed as the Chrysler 300M.

The AMC name disappeared with Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition of the independent automaker, &quot;but the Eagle name carried on, worn by various Renault- and Mitsubishi-sourced models through the 1990s when it was finally retired in 1998.&quot; Those Eagle cars failed because the automaker did not have a coherent marketing strategy for the mix of models and they also lacked effective promotional efforts in the automotive marketplace. In the end, &quot;Chrysler wasn&#x27;t fully committed to the nameplate and also left consumers confused about what an Eagle was -- if they knew the name at all.&quot;

==Eagle cars marketed by Chrysler==

* Eagle Wagon (1988)
The continuation of the AMC Eagle line after Chrysler acquired AMC in only the station wagon body style. Production of the crossover vehicle ended on December 14, 1987. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association NADA Guide, Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;Eagle was spawned from the buyout of American Motors and their AMC Eagle model.&quot;
* Eagle Medallion (1989)
Also badged as the Renault Medallion in March 1987 as an early 1988 model, this car was imported from France, rebadged as an Eagle for the 1989 model year only, and was similar to the Renault 21.
* Eagle Premier (1988–1992)
Designed by AMC, the Premier was briefly badged as the Renault Premier before launch. Unusual (for an FWD car) in having a longitudinal engine mounting (to accommodate a future AWD version), it shared several parts with the Renault 25, and spawned a rebadged version named Dodge Monaco (1990–1992); this platform was the basis for the 1993 LH cars.
* Eagle Vista (1988–1992)
Two models were offered. The two-door hatchback and four-door sedan were rebadged Mitsubishi Mirages, and the station wagon (badged as either an Eagle Vista or a Dodge/Plymouth Colt Vista) was a rebadged Mitsubishi Chariot. These cars were marketed only in Canada.
* Eagle Summit (1989–1996)
Coupe, sedan, and wagon models were available. The coupe and 1987-1991 sedans were rebadged Mitsubishi Mirages, while the wagon was a rebadged Mitsubishi Expo LRV. The 1991-1996 sedan was a rebadged Dodge/Plymouth Colt.
* Eagle Talon (1990–1998)
Like the Plymouth Laser and the Mitsubishi Eclipse, the Talon was Eagle&#x27;s halo car and outsold its Plymouth cousin. (see also Diamond Star Motors)
* Eagle 2000GTX (1991–1992)
A rebadged Mitsubishi Galant four-door sedan. Marketed also as a Dodge only in Canada.
* Eagle Vision (1993–1997)
One of Chrysler&#x27;s three original LH-cars. It was marketed in Europe as the Chrysler Vision.

==Concept car==
The Eagle Optima was a 1990 concept car. It was a four-door sedan that used cab forward design and was powered by an experimental, 32-valve all-aluminum V8 engine with all-wheel drive. The Optima was on the show circuit to judge consumer reaction to the thinly disguised version of the LH platform sedans that were to be introduced for the 1993 model year. Two earlier concept cars emphasizing the cab-forward designs that lead to the LH-based 1993 Eagle Vision were the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino and the 1989 Chrysler Millennium.

<text>Proton (, formal designation: [[Universal Rocket|UR-500]]) is an expendable launch system used for both commercial and Russian government space launches. The first Proton rocket was launched in 1965. Modern versions of the launch system are still in use , making it one of the most successful heavy boosters in the history of spaceflight. The components of all Protons are manufactured in the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center factory in Moscow and Chemical Automatics Design Bureau in Voronezh, then transported to the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where they are assembled at Site 91 to form the launch vehicle. Following payload integration, the rocket is then brought to the launch pad horizontally by rail, and raised into vertical position for launch.

As with many Soviet rockets, the names of recurring payloads became associated with the launch vehicle itself. The moniker &quot;Proton&quot; originates from a series of similarly named scientific satellites, which were among the rocket&#x27;s first payloads. During the Cold War, it was designated the D-1/D-1e or SL-12/SL-13 by Western intelligence agencies.

Launch capacity to low Earth orbit is about . Geostationary transfer capacity is about . Commercial launches are marketed by International Launch Services (ILS).

In 2013, the rocket was intended to be retired before 2030. , production on the Proton rocket is ceasing as the new Angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational. No new launch service contracts for Proton are likely to be signed.

==History==
Proton started its life as a &quot;super heavy ICBM&quot;. It was designed to launch a 100-megaton (or larger) thermonuclear weapon over a distance of 13,000 km. It was hugely oversized for an ICBM and was never deployed in such a capacity. It was eventually used as a space launch vehicle. It was the brainchild of Vladimir Chelomei&#x27;s design bureau as a foil to Sergei Korolev&#x27;s N1 rocket, whose purpose was to send a two-man Zond spacecraft around the Moon; Korolev openly opposed Proton and Chelomei&#x27;s other designs for their use of toxic propellants. 

The unusual appearance of the first stage results from the need to transport components by rail. The central oxidizer tank is the maximum width for the loading gauge of the track. The six tanks surrounding it carry fuel and serve as the attachment points for the engines. Despite resembling strap-on boosters, they are not designed to separate from the central oxidizer tank. The first and second stages are connected by a lattice structure. The second stage engine ignites shortly before separation of the first stage and the lattice allows the exhaust to escape. This is called &quot;hot staging&quot; and it eliminates the need for ullage motors on the second stage.

A rushed development program led to dozens of failures between 1965 and 1972. Proton did not complete its State Trials until 1977, at which point it was judged to have a higher than 90% reliability.

Proton&#x27;s design was kept secret until 1986, with the public being only shown the upper stages in film clips and photographs, and the first time the complete vehicle was shown to the outside world happened during the televised launch of Mir.

Mass-production of guidance, navigation and control system for Proton has begun in 1964 on &quot;Communard&quot; Industrial Association (Kharkov, Ukraine).

Proton launched the uncrewed Soviet circumlunar flights and was intended to have launched the first crewed Soviet circumlunar spaceflights, before the United States flew the Apollo 8 mission. Proton launched the Salyut space stations, the Mir core segment and expansion modules, and both the Zarya and Zvezda modules of the ISS.

Proton also launches commercial satellites, most of them being managed by International Launch Services. The first ILS Proton launch was on 9 April 1996 with the launch of the SES Astra 1F communications satellite.

Between 1994 and mid-2010, Proton revenues were $4.3 billion, and were projected to grow to $6 billion by 2011.

In January 2017, the Proton was temporarily grounded due to the manufacturer, Voronezh Mechanical Plant, having substituted a heat-resistant alloy in the engines with a cheaper metal.

In June 2018, the state corporation Roscosmos announced that the Proton rocket would cease production as the new Angara launch vehicle comes on line and becomes operational. No new launch service contracts for Proton are likely to be signed.

Proton flew its last scheduled commercial mission on 9 October 2019, delivering Eutelsat 5 West B and Mission Extension Vehicle-1 to geostationary orbit. A number of Roscosmos and other Russian government missions remain on Proton launch manifest.

==Proton K==

Proton K is fuelled by very toxic unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. These are hypergolic fuels which ignite on contact, avoiding the need for an ignition system, and can be stored at ambient temperatures. This avoids the need for components that are tolerant of low temperatures, and allows the rocket to remain on the pad indefinitely (other launchers with such capability include the U.S. Titan II GLV, Titan III, and Titan IV, the Chinese Long March 2 and Long March 4, the Soviet/Ukrainian Tsyklon launchers, the Soviet/Russian Kosmos-3 and Kosmos-3M launchers and the European Ariane 1 to Ariane 4 launchers). In contrast, cryogenic fuels need periodic replenishment as they boil off.

The fourth stage has multiple variants, depending on the mission. The simplest, Blok D, was used for interplanetary missions. Blok D had no guidance module, depending on the probe to control flight. Three different Blok DM versions (DM, DM2, and DM-2M) were for high Earth orbits. The Blok D/DM were unusual in that the fuel was stored in a toroidal tank, around the engine and behind the oxidizer tank.

The initial Proton tests in 1965–66 only used the first two stages of the booster, the complete four-stage vehicle being flown for the first time in 1967. When the Soviet space station program began in 1971, Protons began being flown with the Blok D removed for use as a heavy-lift LEO launcher.

Proton-K payloads included all of the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Salyut&quot; space stations, almost all Mir modules (with the exception of the Docking Module, which was launched on the United States Space Shuttle), and the Zarya and Zvezda modules of the International Space Station. It was intended to launch the crewed TKS spacecraft, prior to the cancellation of that programme, although a few robotic flights of spacecraft were fulfilled. In addition it was intended to launch the 1970s LKS spaceplane that was never realised.

The final launch of Proton-K was on 30 March 2012.

==Proton-M==
The initial version of Proton M, could launch into geostationary orbit or into a geostationary transfer orbit. It could place up to in low Earth orbit with a 51.6-degree inclination, the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS).

The Proton M&#x27;s improvements included lower stage modifications to reduce structural mass, increase thrust, and fully use propellants. Generally a Briz-M ( meaning &quot;Breeze&quot;) storable propellant upper stage is used instead of the Blok D or Blok DM stage, removing the need for multiple fuel supplies and oxygen top-off due to boiling; the Proton-M also flew with a Blok-DM upper stage. Efforts were also made to reduce dependency on foreign (usually Ukrainian) component suppliers. With the Briz-M upper stage, the payload fairing diameter is 4.1 m (13.45 ft).

Proton launch vehicles and Briz-M upper stages are designed and built by Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center (Khrunichev) in Moscow, the majority owner of International Launch Services (ILS). The center is home to all engineering, assembly and test functions of Proton production. With the recent consolidation of the Russian space enterprises, Khrunichev has direct oversight and control of up to 70% of all Proton manufacturing from suppliers to manufacturers. The consolidation directly supports Khrunichev&#x27;s ongoing efforts for vertical integration of Proton production.

=== Phase III ===
An enhanced variant, the Phase III Proton-M/Briz-M launch vehicle, was flight proven on the Russian Federal dual mission of Express AM-44 and Express MD-1 in February 2009 and performed its first commercial launch in March 2010 with the Echostar XIV satellite. The Proton-M/Briz-M phase III configuration provides 6150 kg of GTO performance, an increase of 1150 kg over the original Proton-M Briz-M, while maintaining the fundamental design configuration.

On 6 August 2012, the Russian Federal Space Agency lost a Russian and an Indonesian communications satellite in an attempt to launch them into orbit on a Proton-M due to technical difficulties with the last stage.

On 2 July 2013, a Proton-M launching three GLONASS navigation satellites experienced a failure reminiscent of the 1960s disasters shortly after liftoff when the booster crashed near LC-39 at Baikonour, ending a 30-year unbroken stretch without a first stage failure; all future Proton flights were suspended pending investigation. The accident was eventually determined to be caused by the rate gyro package having been installed upside-down. Due to the difficulty of installing the package incorrectly, it was widely suspected that it had been done deliberately by a disgruntled or drunk worker at the Khrunichev plant.

On 15 May 2014, a Proton-M/Briz-M carrying an Ekspress satellite suffered a third stage failure from a bad turbopump bearing. Debris fell in Manchuria. On 21 October, another Ekspress satellite was left in a useless orbit when the Briz stage cut off 24 seconds too early.

On 16 May 2015, a MEXSAT communications satellite failed to orbit due to another third stage malfunction, the eighth Proton failure since 2010.

=== Phase IV ===
Khrunichev has initiated development of a set of phase IV enhancements in order to keep pace with market demands and the mass growth trends of commercial satellites. The implementation of Phase IV Proton Briz-M enhancements were completed in 2016. The payload mass performance for phase IV has been increased to 6320 kg to a reference GTO orbit with 1500 m/s of residual delta V to GSO.

==Future developments==
Significant upgrades were temporarily put on hold following announcement (in 1992) of the new Angara launch vehicle. The single largest upgrade was the KVRB stage. This cryogenic stage would have greatly increased capacity. The engine was developed successfully, and the stage as a whole had progressed to hardware. However, as KVRB is noticeably larger than Block D, the vehicle&#x27;s aerodynamics, flight control, software, and possibly electronics would have to be reevaluated. In addition, the launch pad can supply existing Protons with common hypergolic fuels from single sources. The upper stages, in particular, are fed by common loading pipes running along the rocket. Switching to a stage with different fuels requires the addition of extra support articles; switching to cryogens requires that such support articles top off the stage periodically.

Heavy variants of Angara will be simpler and cheaper than Proton (and like the Atlas V rocket, will not use hypergolic fuels; instead, it will be a kerolox rocket, like the Soyuz rocket). They will also be designed from the start to accept a KVTK stage, and will already have a liquid oxygen supply at the pad; only a hydrogen supply will be called upon.

<text>The Colt M1911 (also known as 1911, Colt 1911, Colt .45, or Colt Government in the case of Colt-produced models) is a single-action, recoil-operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The pistol&#x27;s formal U.S. military designation as of 1940 was &quot;Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911&quot; for the original model adopted in March 1911, and &quot;Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1&quot; for the improved M1911A1 model which entered service in 1926. The designation changed to &quot;Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1&quot; in the Vietnam War era.

Designed by John Browning, the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the short recoil principle in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols. It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as the International Defensive Pistol Association and International Practical Shooting Confederation.

The U.S. military procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The pistol served as the standard-issue sidearm for the United States Armed Forces from 1911 to 1985. It was widely used in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The M1911A1 was replaced by the adoption of the 9mm Beretta M9 pistol as the standard U.S. military sidearm in 1985. However, the U.S. Army did not officially replace the M1911A1 with the Beretta M9 until October 1986; production and procurement delays kept the 1911A1 in service with some units past 1989. The 1911A1 has never been completely phased out. Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the U.S. Army Special Forces, U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy.

==History==

===Early history and adaptations===
The M1911 pistol originated in the late 1890s as the result of a search for a suitable self-loading (or semi-automatic) pistol to replace the variety of revolvers in service at the time.

The United States was adopting new firearms at a phenomenal rate; several new pistols and two all-new service rifles (M1892/96/98 Krag and M1895 Navy Lee), as well as a series of revolvers by Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson for the Army and Navy, were adopted just in that decade.

The next decade would see a similar pace, including the adoption of several more revolvers and an intensive search for a self-loading pistol that would culminate in the official adoption of the M1911 after the turn of the decade.

Hiram S. Maxim had designed a self-loading rifle in the 1880s, but was preoccupied with machine guns. Nevertheless, the application of his principle of using cartridge energy to reload led to several self-loading pistols in 1896. The designs caught the attention of various militaries, each of which began programs to find a suitable one for their forces. In the U.S., such a program would lead to a formal test at the turn of the 20th century.
During the end of 1899 and into 1900, a test of self-loading pistols was conducted, including entries from Mauser (C96 &quot;Broomhandle&quot;), Mannlicher (Mannlicher M1894), and Colt (Colt M1900).

This led to a purchase of 1,000 DWM Luger pistols, chambered in 7.65mm Luger. During field trials, these ran into some problems, especially with stopping power. Other governments had made similar complaints. Consequently, DWM produced an enlarged version of the round, the 9×19mm Parabellum with fifty weapons chambered for it tested by the U.S. Army in 1903.

American units fighting Tausūg guerrillas in the Moro Rebellion in Sulu during the Philippine–American War using the then-standard Colt M1892 revolver, .38 Long Colt, found it to be unsuitable for the rigors of jungle warfare, particularly in terms of stopping power, as the Moros had high battle morale and often used drugs to inhibit the sensation of pain. The U.S. Army briefly reverted to using the M1873 single-action revolver in .45 Colt caliber, which had been standard during the late 19th century; the heavier bullet was found to be more effective against charging tribesmen. The problems prompted the Chief of Ordnance, General William Crozier, to authorize further testing for a new service pistol.

Following the 1904 Thompson-LaGarde pistol round effectiveness tests, Colonel John T. Thompson stated that the new pistol &quot;should not be of less than .45 caliber&quot; and would preferably be semi-automatic in operation. This led to the 1906 trials of pistols from six firearms manufacturing companies (namely, Colt, Bergmann, Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM), Savage Arms, Knoble, Webley, and White-Merrill).

Of the six designs submitted, three were eliminated early on, leaving only the Savage, Colt, and DWM designs chambered in the new .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge. These three still had issues that needed correction, but only Colt and Savage resubmitted their designs. There is some debate over the reasons for DWM&#x27;s withdrawal—some say they felt there was bias and that the DWM design was being used primarily as a &quot;whipping boy&quot; for the Savage and Colt pistols, though this does not fit well with the earlier 1900 purchase of the DWM design over the Colt and Steyr entries. In any case, a series of field tests from 1907 to 1911 were held to decide between the Savage and Colt designs. Both designs were improved between each round of testing, leading up to the final test before adoption.

Among the areas of success for the Colt was a test at the end of 1910 attended by its designer, John Browning. Six thousand rounds were fired from a single pistol over the course of two days. When the gun began to grow hot, it was simply immersed in water to cool it. The Colt gun passed with no reported malfunctions, while the Savage designs had 37.

===Service history===
Following its success in trials, the Colt pistol was formally adopted by the Army on March 29, 1911, when it was designated &quot;Model of 1911&quot;, later changed in 1917 to &quot;Model 1911&quot;, and then &quot;M1911&quot; in the mid-1920s. The Director of Civilian Marksmanship began manufacture of M1911 pistols for members of the National Rifle Association of America in August 1912. Approximately 100 pistols stamped &quot;N.R.A.&quot; below the serial number were manufactured at Springfield Armory and by Colt. The M1911 was formally adopted by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps in 1913. The .45 ACP &quot;Model of 1911 U.S. Army&quot; was used by both U.S. Army Cavalry troops and infantry soldiers during the United States&#x27; Punitive Expedition into Mexico against Pancho Villa in 1916.

====World War I====
By the beginning of 1917, a total of 68,533 M1911 pistols had been delivered to U.S. armed forces by Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company and the U.S. government&#x27;s Springfield Armory. However, the need to greatly expand U.S. military forces and the resultant surge in demand for the firearm in World War I saw the expansion of manufacture to other contractors besides Colt and Springfield Armory, including Remington-UMC and North American Arms Co. of Quebec. Several other manufacturers were awarded contracts to produce the M1911, including the National Cash Register Company, the Savage Arms Company, the Caron Brothers Manufacturing of Montreal, the Burroughs Adding Machine Co., Winchester Repeating Arms Company, and the Lanston Monotype Company, but the signing of the Armistice resulted in the cancellation of the contracts before any pistols had been produced.

====Interwar changes====
Battlefield experience in World War I led to some more small external changes, completed in 1924. The new version received a modified type classification, M1911A1, in 1926 with a stipulation that M1911A1s should have serial numbers higher than 700,000 with lower serial numbers designated M1911. The M1911A1 changes to the original design consisted of a shorter trigger, cutouts in the frame behind the trigger, an arched mainspring housing, a longer grip safety spur (to prevent hammer bite), a wider front sight, a shortened hammer spur, and simplified grip checkering (eliminating the &quot;Double Diamond&quot; reliefs). These changes were subtle and largely intended to make the pistol easier to shoot for those with smaller hands. No significant internal changes were made, and parts remained interchangeable between the M1911 and the M1911A1.

Working for the U.S. Ordnance Office, David Marshall Williams developed a .22 training version of the M1911 using a floating chamber to give the .22 long rifle rimfire recoil similar to the .45 version. As the Colt Service Ace, this was available both as a pistol and as a conversion kit for .45 M1911 pistols.

Before World War II, 500 M1911s were produced under license by the Norwegian arms factory &quot;Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk&quot;, as &quot;Automatisk Pistol Model 1912&quot;. Then, production moved to a modified version designated &quot;Pistol Model 1914&quot; and unofficially known as &quot;Kongsberg Colt&quot;. The Pistol M/1914 is noted for its unusual extended slide stop which was specified by Norwegian ordnance authorities. Twenty-two thousand were produced between 1914 and 1940 but production continued after the German occupation of Norway in 1940 and 10,000 were produced for the German armed forces as &quot;Pistole 657 (n)&quot;.

Between 1927 and 1966, 102,000 M1911 pistols were produced as &quot;Sistema Colt Modelo 1927&quot; in Argentina, first by the Dirección General de Fabricaciones Militares. A similar gun, the Ballester–Molina, was also designed and produced.

The M1911 and M1911A1 pistols were also ordered from Colt or produced domestically in modified form by several other nations, including Brazil (M1937 contract pistol), Mexico (M1911 Mexican contract pistol and the Obregón pistol), and Spain (private manufacturers Star and Llama).

====World War II====
World War II and the years leading up to it created a great demand. During the war, about 1.9 million units were procured by the U.S. Government for all forces, production being undertaken by several manufacturers, including Remington Rand (900,000 produced), Colt (400,000), Ithaca Gun Company (400,000), Union Switch &amp; Signal (50,000), and Singer (500). New M1911A1 pistols were given a parkerized metal finish instead of bluing, and the wood grip panels were replaced with panels made of brown plastic. The M1911A1 was a favored small arm of both U.S. and allied military personnel during the war. In particular, the pistol was prized by some British commando units and Britain&#x27;s highly covert Special Operations Executive, as well as South African Commonwealth forces.

The M1911A1 pistol was produced in very large quantities during the war. At the end of hostilities the government cancelled all contracts for further production and made use of existing stocks of weapons to equip personnel. Many of these weapons had seen service use, and had to be rebuilt and refinished prior to being issued. From the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s thousands of 1911s and 1911A1s were refurbished at U.S. arsenals and service depots. These rebuilds consisted of anything from minor inspections to major overhauls. Pistols that were refurbished at government arsenals will usually be marked on the frame/receiver with the arsenal&#x27;s initials, such as RIA for Rock Island Armory or SA for Springfield Armory.

Among collectors today, the Singer-produced pistols in particular are highly prized, commanding high prices even in poor condition.

====General Officer&#x27;s Model====
From 1943 to 1945 a fine-grade russet-leather M1916 pistol belt set was issued to some generals in the U.S. Army. It was composed of a leather belt, leather enclosed flap-holster with braided leather tie-down leg strap, leather two-pocket magazine pouch, and a rope lanyard. The metal buckle and fittings were in gilded brass. The buckle had the seal of the U.S. on the center (or &quot;male&quot;) piece and a laurel wreath on the circular (or &quot;female&quot;) piece. The pistol was a standard-issue M1911A1 that came with a cleaning kit and three magazines.

From 1972 to 1981 a modified M1911A1 called the RIA M15 General Officer&#x27;s Model was issued to general officers in the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force. From 1982 to 1986 the regular M1911A1 was issued. Both came with a black leather belt, open holster with retaining strap, and a two-pocket magazine pouch. The metal buckle and fittings were similar to the M1916 General Officer&#x27;s Model except it came in gold metal for the Army and in silver metal for the Air Force.

====Post–World War II usage====
After World War II, the M1911 continued to be a mainstay of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Korean War and the Vietnam War, where it was used extensively by tunnel rats. It was used during Desert Storm in specialized U.S. Army units and U.S. Navy Mobile Construction Battalions (Seabees), and has seen service in both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, with U.S. Army Special Forces Groups and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Companies.

However, by the late 1970s, the M1911A1 was acknowledged to be showing its age. Under political pressure from Congress to standardize on a single modern pistol design, the U.S. Air Force ran a Joint Service Small Arms Program to select a new semi-automatic pistol using the NATO-standard 9mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. After trials, the Beretta 92S-1 was chosen. The Army contested this result and subsequently ran its own competition in 1981, the XM9 trials, eventually leading to the official adoption of the Beretta 92F on January 14, 1985. By the late 1980s production was ramping up despite a controversial XM9 retrial and a separate XM10 reconfirmation that was boycotted by some entrants of the original trials, cracks in the frames of some pre-M9 Beretta-produced pistols, and despite a problem with slide separation using higher-than-specified-pressure rounds that resulted in injuries to some U.S. Navy special operations operatives. This last issue resulted in an updated model that includes additional protection for the user, the 92FS, and updates to the ammunition used. During the Gulf War of 1990–1991, M1911A1s were deployed with reserve component U.S. Army units sent to participate in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

By the early 1990s, most M1911A1s had been replaced by the Beretta M9, though a limited number remain in use by special units. The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in particular were noted for continuing the use of M1911 pistols for selected personnel in MEU(SOC) and reconnaissance units (though the USMC also purchased over 50,000 M9 pistols.) For its part, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) issued a requirement for a .45 ACP pistol in the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) trials. This resulted in the Heckler &amp; Koch OHWS becoming the MK23 Mod 0 Offensive Handgun Weapon System (itself being heavily based on the 1911&#x27;s basic field strip), beating the Colt OHWS, a much-modified M1911. Dissatisfaction with the stopping power of the 9 mm Parabellum cartridge used in the Beretta M9 has actually promoted re-adoption of pistols based on the .45 ACP cartridge such as the M1911 design, along with other pistols, among USSOCOM units in recent years, though the M9 has been predominant both within SOCOM and in the U.S. military in general. Both U.S. Army Special Forces Units and SFOD-D continue to use modernized M1911s, such as the M45 MEU(SOC) and a modified version of the Colt Rail Gun (a 1911 model with an integrated picatinny rail on the underside of the frame) designated as the M45A1 CQBP (Close Quarters Battle Pistol).

==Design==

Browning&#x27;s basic M1911 design has seen very little change throughout its production life. The basic principle of the pistol is recoil operation. As the expanding combustion gases force the bullet down the barrel, they give reverse momentum to the slide and barrel which are locked together during this portion of the firing cycle. After the bullet has left the barrel, the slide and barrel continue rearward a short distance.

At this point, a link pivots the rear of the barrel down, out of locking recesses in the slide, and the barrel is stopped by making contact with the lower barrel lugs against the frame. As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the firing chamber and an ejector strikes the rear of the case, pivoting the casing out and away from the pistol through the ejection port. The slide stops its rearward motion then, and is propelled forward again by the recoil spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber. At the forward end of its travel, the slide locks into the barrel and is ready to fire again. 

However, if the fired round was the last in the magazine, the slide will lock in the rearward position, which notifies the shooter to reload by ejecting the empty magazine and inserting a loaded magazine, and facilitates (by being rearwards) reloading the chamber, which is accomplished by either pulling the slide back slightly and releasing, or by pushing down on the slide stop, which releases the slide to move forward under spring pressure, strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine, and feed it into the firing chamber.

Other than grip screws there are no fasteners of any type in the 1911 design. The main components of the gun are held in place by the force of the main spring. The pistol can be &quot;field stripped&quot; by partially retracting the slide, removing the slide stop, and removing the barrel bushing. Full disassembly (and subsequent reassembly) of the pistol to its component parts can be accomplished using several manually removed components as tools to complete the disassembly.

The military mandated a grip safety and a manual safety. A grip safety, sear disconnect, slide stop, half cock position, and manual safety (located on the left rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911A1s. Several companies have developed a firing pin block safety. Colt&#x27;s 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers, including Kimber and Smith &amp; Wesson, use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety. Language cautioning against pulling the trigger with the second finger was included in the initial M1911 manual and later manuals up to the 1940s.

The same basic design has been offered commercially and has been used by other militaries. In addition to the .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), models chambered for .38 Super, 9×19mm Parabellum, 7.65mm Parabellum, 9mm Steyr, .400 Corbon, and other cartridges were offered. The M1911 was developed from earlier Colt semi-automatic designs, firing rounds such as .38 ACP. The design beat out many other contenders during the government&#x27;s selection period, during the late 1890s and early 1900s, up to the pistol&#x27;s adoption. The M1911 officially replaced a range of revolvers and pistols across branches of the U.S. armed forces, though a number of other designs have seen use in certain niches.

Despite being challenged by newer and lighter weight pistol designs in .45 caliber, such as the Glock 21, the SIG Sauer P220, the Springfield XD and the Heckler &amp; Koch USP, the M1911 shows no signs of decreasing popularity and continues to be widely present in various competitive matches such as those of USPSA, IDPA, IPSC, and Bullseye.

==Versions==

===M45 MEU(SOC)===
In 1986, the USMC Precision Weapon Section (PWS) at Marine Corps Base Quantico began customizing M1911A1s for reconnaissance units. The units served in a new Marine Corps program Marine expeditionary unit (special operations capable) (MEU(SOC)). The pistol was designated the M45 MEU(SOC). Hand-selected Colt M1911A1 frames were gutted, deburred and were then assembled with after-market grip safeties, ambidextrous thumb safeties, triggers, improved high-visibility sights, accurized barrels, grips, and improved Wilson magazines. These hand-made pistols were tuned to specifications and preferences of end users.

In the late 1980s, the Marines laid out a series of specifications and improvements to make Browning&#x27;s design ready for 21st-century combat, many of which have been included in MEU(SOC) pistol designs, but design and supply time was limited. Discovering that the Los Angeles Police Department was pleased with their special Kimber M1911 pistols, a single source request was issued to Kimber for just such a pistol despite the imminent release of their TLE/RLII models. Kimber shortly began producing a limited number of what would be later termed the Interim Close Quarters Battle pistol (ICQB). Maintaining the simple recoil assembly, 5-inch barrel (though using a stainless steel match grade barrel), and internal extractor, the ICQB is not much different from Browning&#x27;s original design.

===M45A1===
In July 2012, the USMC awarded Colt a $22.5 million contract for up to 12,000 M45A1 pistols with an initial order of 4036 pistols to replace the M45 MEU(SOC) pistol. The Marine Corps issued the M45A1 to Force Reconnaissance companies, Marine Corps Special Operations Command (MARSOC) and Special Reaction Teams from the Provost Marshal’s Office. The new 1911 was designated M45A1 or &quot;Close Quarters Battle Pistol&quot; CQBP. The M45A1 features a dual recoil spring assembly, Picatinny rails and is cerakoted tan in color.

In 2019, the USMC selected the SIG Sauer M18 to replace the M45A1. The Marines began the roll out of the M18 in 2020. The replacement was completed by October 2022.

===Civilian models===

* Colt Commander: In 1949 Colt began production of the Colt Commander, an aluminum-framed 1911 with a inch barrel and a rounded hammer. It was developed in response to an Army requirement issued in 1949, for a lighter replacement for the M1911 pistol, for issue to officers. In 1970, Colt introduced the all-steel &quot;Colt Combat Commander&quot;, with an optional model in satin nickel. To differentiate between the two models, the aluminum-framed model was renamed the &quot;Lightweight Commander&quot;.
* Colt Government Mk. IV Series 70 (1970–1983): Introduced the accurized Split Barrel Bushing (collet bushing). The first 1000 prototypes in the serial number range 35800NM–37025NM were marked BB on the barrel and the slide. Commander-sized pistols retained the solid bushing.
* Colt Government Mk. IV Series 80 (1983–present): Introduced an internal firing pin safety and a new half-cock notch on the sear; pulling the trigger on these models while at half-cock will cause the hammer to drop. Models after 1988 returned to the solid barrel bushing due to concerns about breakages of collet bushings.
* Colt Gold Cup National Match 1911/Mk. IV Series 70/Mk. IV Series 80 MKIV/Series 70 Gold Cup 75th Anniversary National Match/Camp Perry 1978. Limited to 200 pistols. (1983–1996) Gold Cup MKIV Series 80 National Match: .45 ACP, Colt-Elliason adjustable rear sight, fully adjustable Bomar-Style rear sight, target post front sight, spur hammer, wide target trigger, lowered and flared ejection port, National Match barrel, beveled top slide, wrap-around rubber stocks with nickel medallion.
* Colt 1991 Series (1991–2001 ORM; 2001–present NRM): A hybrid of the M1911A1 military model redesigned to use the slide of the Mk. IV Series 80; these models aimed at providing a more &quot;mil-spec&quot; pistol to be sold at a lower price than Colt&#x27;s other 1911 models in order to compete with imported pistols from manufacturers such as Springfield Armory and Norinco. The 1991–2001 model used a large &quot;M1991A1&quot; roll mark engraved on the slide. The 2001 model introduced a new &quot;Colt&#x27;s Government Model&quot; roll mark engraving. The 1991 series incorporates full-sized blued and stainless models in either .45 ACP or .38 Super, as well as blued and stainless Commander models in .45 ACP.

===Custom models===
Since its inception, the M1911 has lent itself to easy customization. Replacement sights, grips, and other aftermarket accessories are the most commonly offered parts. Since the 1950s and the rise of competitive pistol shooting, many companies have been offering the M1911 as a base model for major customization. These modifications can range from changing the external finish, checkering the frame, to hand fitting custom hammers, triggers, and sears. Some modifications include installing compensators and the addition of accessories such as tactical lights and even scopes. A common modification of John Browning&#x27;s design is to use a full-length guide rod that runs the full length of the recoil spring. This adds weight to the front of the pistol, but does not increase accuracy, and does make the pistol slightly more difficult to disassemble. As of 2002, custom guns could cost over and are built from scratch or on existing base models. Some notable companies offering custom M1911s include Dan Wesson Firearms, Les Baer, Nighthawk Custom, Springfield Custom Shop, and Wilson Combat. IPSC models are offered by BUL Armory, Strayer Voigt Inc (Infinity Firearms).

===Current users in the U.S.===
Many military and law enforcement organizations in the U.S. and other countries continue to use (often modified) M1911A1 pistols including Los Angeles Police Department SWAT and S.I.S., the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, FBI regional SWAT teams, and 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment—Delta (Delta Force).

The M1911A1 is popular among the general public in the U.S. for practical and recreational purposes. The pistol is commonly used for concealed carry thanks in part to a single-stack magazine (which makes for a thinner pistol that is, therefore, easier to conceal), personal defense, target shooting, and competition as well as collections. Numerous aftermarket accessories allow users to customize the pistol to their liking. There are a growing number of manufacturers of M1911-style pistols and the model continues to be quite popular for its reliability, simplicity, and patriotic appeal. Various tactical, target and compact models are available. Price ranges from a low end of around $400 for basic models imported from Turkey (TİSAŞ and GİRSAN) and the Philippines (Armscor, Metro Arms, and SAM Inc.) to more than $4,000 for the best competition or tactical versions (Wilson Combat, Ed Brown, Les Baer, Nighthawk Custom, and Staccato).

Due to an increased demand for M1911 pistols among Army Special Operations units, who are known to field a variety of M1911 pistols, the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit began looking to develop a new generation of M1911s and launched the M1911-A2 project in late 2004. The goal was to produce a minimum of seven variants with various sights, internal and external extractors, flat and arched mainspring housings, integral and add-on magazine wells, a variety of finishes and other options, with the idea of providing the end-user a selection from which to select the features that best fit their missions. The AMU performed a well-received demonstration of the first group of pistols to the Marine Corps at Quantico and various Special Operations units at Ft. Bragg and other locations. The project provided a feasibility study with insight into future projects. Models were loaned to various Special Operations units, the results of which are classified. An RFP was issued for a Joint Combat Pistol but it was ultimately canceled. Currently, units are experimenting with an M1911 pistol in .40 S&amp;W, which will incorporate lessons learned from the A2 project. Ultimately, the M1911A2 project provided a testbed for improving existing M1911s. An improved M1911 variant becoming available in the future is a possibility.

The Springfield Custom Professional Model 1911A1 pistol is produced under contract by Springfield Armory for the FBI regional SWAT teams and the Hostage Rescue Team. This pistol is made in batches on a regular basis by the Springfield Custom Shop, and a few examples from most runs are made available for sale to the general public at a selling price of approximately US$2,700 each.

===International users===

* The Brazilian company IMBEL (&quot;Indústria de Material Bélico do Brasil&quot;) still produces the pistol in several variants for civilian, military and law enforcement uses in .45 ACP, .40 S&amp;W, .380 ACP and 9 mm calibers. IMBEL also produces for US civilian market as the supplier to Springfield Armory.
* The Chinese Arms manufacturer, Norinco, exports a clone of the M1911A1 for civilian purchase as the M1911A1 and the high-capacity NP-30, as well 9mm variants the NP-28 and NP-29. China has also manufactured conversion kits to chamber the 7.62×25mm Tokarev round following the Korean War. Importation of Norinco-made M1911 pistols into the United States was blocked by trade rules in 1993 but Norinco still manages to import the weapon into Canada and successfully adopted by IPSC shooters, gunsmiths and firearms enthusiasts there because of the cheaper price of the pistol than the other M1911s.
* The German &quot;Volkssturm&quot; used captured M1911s at the end of World War II under the weapon code P.660(a), in which the letter &#x27;a&#x27; refers to &quot;Amerika&quot;, the weapon&#x27;s country of origin.
* Norway used the Kongsberg Colt which was a license-produced variant and is identified by the unique slide catch. Many Spanish firearms manufacturers produced pistols derived from 1911, such as the STAR Model B, the ASTRA 1911PL, and the Llama Model IX, to name just a few.

* Argentine Navy received 1,721 M1911 between 1914 and 1919. 21,616 were received for Argentine Armed Forces between 1914 and 1941. Later, some ex-US Navy Colts were transferred with ex-US ships. Argentina produced under license some 102,494 M1911A1s as &quot;Model 1927 Sistema Colt&quot;, which eventually led to production of the cheaper Ballester–Molina, which resembles the 1911.
* The Armed Forces of the Philippines issues Mil-spec M1911A1 pistols as a sidearm to the special forces, military police, and officers. These pistols are mostly produced by Colt, though some of them are produced locally by Armscor, a Philippine company specialized in making 1911-style pistols.
* The Indonesian Army issued a locally produced version of the Colt M1911A1, chambered in .45 ACP along with the Pindad P1, the locally manufactured Browning Hi-Power pistol as the standard-issue sidearm.
* In the 1950s, the Republic of China Army (Taiwan) used original M1911A1s, and the batches are now still used by some forces. In 1962, Taiwan copied the M1911A1 as the &quot;T51&quot; pistol, and it saw limited use in the Army. After that, the T51 was improved and introduced for export as the &quot;T51K1&quot;. Now the pistols in service are replaced by locally-made Beretta 92 pistols- the T75 pistol.
* The Royal Thai Army and Royal Thai Police uses the Type 86, the Thai copy of the M1911 chambered in the .45 ACP round,
* The Turkish Land Forces uses &quot;MC 1911&quot; Girsan made copy of M1911.
* Numbers of Colt M1911s were used by the Royal Navy as sidearms during World War I in .455 Webley Automatic caliber. The pistols were then transferred to the Royal Air Force where they saw use in limited numbers up until the end of World War II as sidearms for aircrew in event of bailing out in enemy territory. The weapon also found use among the British airborne, commandos, Special Air Service, and Special Operations Executive
* Some units of the South Korean Air Force still use these original batches as officers&#x27; sidearms (along with Daewoo K5).

<text>Biscayne National Park is a national park of the United States located south of Miami, Florida, in Miami-Dade County. The park preserves Biscayne Bay and its offshore barrier reefs. Ninety-five percent of the park is water, and the shore of the bay is the location of an extensive mangrove forest. The park covers and includes Elliott Key, the park&#x27;s largest island and northernmost of the true Florida Keys, formed from fossilized coral reef. The islands farther north in the park are transitional islands of coral and sand. The offshore portion of the park includes the northernmost region of the Florida Reef, one of the largest coral reefs in the world.

Biscayne National Park protects four distinct ecosystems: part of the Florida mangroves along the shoreline, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys, and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps of the mainland and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs, and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales, and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus&#x27; swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.

The people of the Glades culture inhabited the Biscayne Bay region as early as 10,000 years ago before rising sea levels filled the bay. The Tequesta people occupied the islands and shoreline from about 4,000 years before the present to the 16th century, when the Spanish took possession of Florida. Reefs claimed ships from Spanish times through the 20th century, with more than 40 documented wrecks within the park&#x27;s boundaries. While the park&#x27;s islands were farmed during the 19th and early 20th centuries, their rocky soil and periodic hurricanes made agriculture difficult to sustain.

In the early 20th century the islands became secluded destinations for wealthy Miamians who built getaway homes and social clubs. Mark C. Honeywell&#x27;s guesthouse on Boca Chita Key that featured a mock lighthouse was the area&#x27;s most elaborate private retreat. The Cocolobo Cay Club was at various times owned by Miami developer Carl G. Fisher, yachtsman Garfield Wood, and President Richard Nixon&#x27;s friend Bebe Rebozo, and was visited by four United States presidents. The amphibious community of Stiltsville, established in the 1930s in the shoals of northern Biscayne Bay, took advantage of its remoteness from land to offer offshore gambling and alcohol during Prohibition. After the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the Central Intelligence Agency and Cuban exile groups used Elliott Key as a training ground for infiltrators into Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba.

Originally proposed for inclusion in Everglades National Park, Biscayne Bay was removed from the proposed park to ensure Everglades&#x27; establishment. The area remained undeveloped until the 1960s, when a series of proposals were made to develop the keys in the manner of Miami Beach, and to construct a deepwater seaport for bulk cargo, along with refinery and petrochemical facilities on the mainland shore of Biscayne Bay. Through the 1960s and 1970s, two fossil-fueled power plants and two nuclear power plants were built on the bay shores. A backlash against development led to the 1968 designation of Biscayne National Monument. The preserved area was expanded by its 1980 re-designation as Biscayne National Park. The park is heavily used by boaters, and apart from the park&#x27;s visitor center on the mainland and a jetty at Black Point Marina, its land and sea areas are accessible only by boat.

==Geography==

Biscayne National Park comprises in Miami-Dade County in southeast Florida. Extending from just south of Key Biscayne southward to just north of Key Largo, the park includes Soldier Key, the Ragged Keys, Sands Key, Elliott Key, Totten Key and Old Rhodes Key, as well as smaller islands that form the northernmost extension of the Florida Keys. The Safety Valve, a wide shallow opening in the island chain, between the Ragged Keys and Key Biscayne just north of the park&#x27;s boundary, allows storm surge water to flow out of the bay after the passage of tropical storms. The park&#x27;s eastern boundary is the ten-fathom line () of water depth in the Atlantic Ocean on the Florida Reef. The park&#x27;s western boundary is a fringe of property on the mainland, extending a few hundred meters inland between Cutler Ridge and Mangrove Point. The only direct mainland access to the park is at the Convoy Point Visitor Center, adjacent to the park headquarters. The southwestern boundary adjoins the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station and its system of cooling canals.

The southern portion of Biscayne Bay extends between Elliott Key and the mainland, transited by the Intracoastal Waterway. The park abuts the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary on the east and south sides of the park and John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park to the south. Only of the park&#x27;s area are on land, with the offshore keys comprising and mainland mangrove swamps account for the remaining . As an extension of the Everglades ecosystem, much of the park was originally proposed to be included in Everglades National Park, but was excluded to obtain a consensus for the establishment of the Everglades park in 1947.

===Geology===

Biscayne Bay marks the southernmost extent of the Atlantic barrier islands, represented by Key Biscayne and the northernmost extent of the Florida Keys at Elliott Key. The keys are distinguished from the barrier islands by the coral limestone that extends to the islands&#x27; surface under a thin veneer of topsoil, while the barrier islands are dominated by wave-deposited sands that cover most of the limestones. Biscayne Bay lies between low ridges of oolitic Miami Limestone on the west, forming Cutler Ridge and the coral-based Key Largo limestone that underlies Elliott Key and the keys to the south. The Miami limestone was deposited in turbulent lagoon waters.

The Key Largo Limestone is a fossilized coral reef formed during the Sangamonian Stage of about 75,000 to 125,000 years ago. The Miami Formation achieved its present form somewhat later, during a glacial period in which fresh water consolidated and cemented the lagoon deposits. The Key Largo Limestone is a coarse stone formed from stony corals, between in thickness. As a consequence of their origins as reefs, the beaches of Elliott Key and Old Rhodes Key are rocky. Significant sandy beaches are found only at Sands Key.

===Hydrology===
Biscayne Bay is a shallow semi-enclosed lagoon which averages in depth. Both its mainland margins and the keys are covered by mangrove forest. The park includes the southern portion of Biscayne Bay, with areas of thin sediment called &quot;hardbottom&quot;, and vegetated seagrass meadows supporting turtlegrass and shoal grass.

As a result of efforts to control water resources in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of water out of the southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.

==Human history==
===Native people===

Native Americans were present in lower Florida 10,000 years ago, when ocean levels were low and Biscayne Bay was comparatively empty of water. Water levels rose from about 4000 years ago and inundated the bay. Archeologists believe any traces left by the peoples of that era are now submerged; none now exist on dry lands in the park. The Cutler Fossil Site, just to the west of the park, has yielded evidence of human occupation extending to at least 10000 years before the present.

The earliest evidence of human presence in Biscayne dates to about 2500 years before the present, with piles of conch and whelk shells left by the Glades culture. The Glades culture was followed by the Tequesta people, who occupied the shores of Biscayne Bay. The Tequesta were a sedentary community that lived on fish and other sea life, with no significant agricultural activity. A site on Sands Key has yielded potsherds, worked shells and other artifacts indicating occupation from at latest 1000 CE to about 1650, after contact was made with Europeans. Fifty significant archaeological sites have been identified in the park.

===Exploration===
Juan Ponce de León explored the area in 1513, discovering the Florida Keys and encountering the Tequesta on the mainland. Other Spanish explorers arrived later in the 16th century and Florida came under Spanish rule. The Tequesta were resettled by the then-Spanish government in the Florida Keys, and the South Florida mainland was depopulated. Ponce de León referred to the bay as &quot;Chequescha&quot; after its inhabitants, becoming &quot;Tequesta&quot; by the time of Spanish governor Pedro Menéndez de Avilés later in the century. The present name has been attributed to a shipwrecked Basque sailor known as the &quot;Biscaino&quot; or &quot;Viscayno&quot; who lived in the area for a time, or to a more general allusion to the Bay of Biscay.

Spanish treasure fleets regularly sailed past the Florida Keys and were often caught in hurricanes. There are 44 documented shipwrecks in the park from the 16th through the 20th centuries. At least two 18th-century Spanish ships were wrecked in the park area. The Spanish galleon &quot;Nuestra Senora del Popolo&quot; is believed to have been wrecked in park waters in 1733, though the site has not been found. HMS &quot;Fowey&quot; was wrecked in 1748 in what is now Legare Anchorage, at some distance from the Fowey Rocks. The discovery of the ship in 1975 resulted in a landmark court case that established the wreck as an archaeological site rather than a salvage site. 43 wrecks are included on the National Register of Historic Places in the Offshore Reefs Archeological District, which extends for along the seaward side of the Biscayne National Park keys. During the 18th century, Elliott Key was the reputed base of two different pirates, both called Black Caesar, commemorated by Caesar&#x27;s Creek between Elliott and Old Rhodes Key.

===Settlement and pre-park use===

The first permanent European settlers in the Miami area did not come until the early 19th century. The first settlements around Biscayne Bay were small farms on Elliott Key growing crops like key limes and pineapples. John James Audubon visited Elliott Key in 1832. Colonel Robert E. Lee surveyed the area around Biscayne Bay for potential fortification sites in 1849. At the end of the American Civil War in 1865, a number of Confederates passed through the area as they were attempting to escape to Cuba. Elliott Key was a brief stopping point for John C. Breckinridge during his flight to Cuba. The former United States vice president, Confederate general and Confederate secretary of war spent two nights in Biscayne Bay on his journey. Few people lived in the park area until 1897, when Israel Lafayette Jones, an African-American property manager, bought Porgy Key for US$300 (). The next year Jones bought the adjoining Old Rhodes Key and moved his family there, clearing land to grow limes and pineapples.

In 1911, Jones bought Totten Key, which had been used as a pineapple plantation, for a dollar an acre, selling in 1925 for US$250,000. Before Israel Jones&#x27; death in 1932 the Jones plantations were for a while among the largest lime producers on the Florida east coast.

Carl G. Fisher, who was responsible for much of the development of Miami Beach, bought Adams Key, once known as Cocolobo Key, in 1916 and built the Cocolobo Cay Club in 1922. The two-story club building had ten guest rooms, a dining room, and a separate recreation lodge. Patrons included Warren G. Harding, Albert Fall, T. Coleman du Pont, Harvey Firestone, Jack Dempsey, Charles F. Kettering, Will Rogers and Frank Seiberling. Israel Jones&#x27; sons Lancelot and Arthur dropped out of the lime-growing business after competition from Mexican limes made their business less profitable, and after a series of devastating hurricanes in 1938 they became full-time fishing guides at the Cocolobo Club. The club had declined with the crash of 1929 which cost Fisher his fortune, but was revived by Garfield Wood in 1934. Among the Joneses&#x27; clients was avid fisherman Herbert Hoover and his family. The Joneses also provided the club with fish, lobster and crabs. Arthur and Lancelot Jones were the second largest landowners and the only permanent residents of the lower Biscayne Bay keys during the 1960s. Wood sold the Cocolobo Cay Club to a group of investors led by Miami banker Bebe Rebozo in 1954, who renamed it the Coco Lobo Fishing Club. Clients guided by the Joneses through the 1940s and 1950s included then-senators John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Herman Talmadge, and George Smathers.

During the Cold War the future park area was a training ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for Bay of Pigs invasion. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built on the key. As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.

===Proposed development===
As modern communities grew in and around Miami, developers looked to southern Miami-Dade County for new projects. The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne were viewed as prime development territory.

Beginning in the 1890s, local interests promoted the construction of a causeway to the mainland. One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the Overseas Highway at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north. At the same time, pressure built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida. This led to competing priorities between those who wanted to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development. On December 6, 1960, 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of Islandia on Elliott Key. The town was incorporated to encourage Dade County to improve access to Elliott Key, which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach. The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers.

In 1962, an industrial seaport was proposed for the mainland shores of Biscayne Bay, to be known as SeaDade. SeaDade, supported by billionaire shipping magnate Daniel K. Ludwig, would have included an oil refinery. In addition to the physical structures, it would have been necessary to dredge a channel through the bay for large ships to access the refinery. The channel would have also required cutting through the coral reef to get to the deep water. In 1963 Florida Power and Light (FP&amp;L) announced plans for two new 400-megawatt oil-fired power plants on undeveloped land at Turkey Point.

Many local residents and politicians supported SeaDade because it would have created additional jobs, but a group of early environmentalists thought the costs were too high. They fought against development of the bay and formed the Safe Progress Association. Led by Lloyd Miller, the president of the local chapter of the Izaak Walton League, &quot;Miami Herald&quot; reporter Juanita Greene, and Art Marshall, the opponents of industrialization proposed the creation of a national park unit that would protect the reefs, islands and bay. After initial skepticism, the park proposal obtained the support of &quot;Miami Herald&quot; editors, as well as Florida Congressman Dante Fascell and Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr., and were supported by lobbying efforts by sympathetic businessmen including Herbert Hoover, Jr.

One vision of Islandia, supported by land owners, would have connected the northern Florida Keys from Key Biscayne to Key Largo, with bridges and created new islands using the fill from the SeaDade channel. Although Miami-area politicians and the state of Florida did not support Ludwig&#x27;s SeaDade plans, Islandia&#x27;s supporters continued to lobby for development support. In 1968, when it appeared the area was about to become a national monument, Islandia supporters bulldozed a highway six lanes wide down the center of the island, destroying the forest for . Islandia landowners called it Elliott Key Boulevard, but called it &quot;Spite Highway&quot; privately. It was hoped that since there was so much environmental damage, no one would want it for a national monument. Over time in the near-tropical climate, the forest grew back and now the only significant hiking trail on Elliott Key now follows the path of Elliott Key Boulevard.

The oil-fired Turkey Point power stations were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from the discharge of hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses. In 1964 FP&amp;L announced plans for two 693 MW nuclear reactors at the site, which were expected to compound the cooling water problem. Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the power stations were projected to consume a significant proportion of the bay&#x27;s waters each day for cooling. After extensive negotiations and litigation with both the state and with Ludwig, who owned lands needed for cooling water canals, a closed-loop canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.

Portions of the present park were used for recreation prior to the park&#x27;s establishment. Homestead Bayfront Park, still operated by Miami-Dade County just south of Convoy Point, established a &quot;blacks-only&quot; segregated beach for African-Americans at the present site of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center. The segregated beach operated through the 1950s into the early 1960s before segregated public facilities were abolished.

===Park establishment and history===
The earliest proposals for the protection of Biscayne Bay were part of proposals by Everglades National Park advocate Ernest F. Coe, whose proposed Everglades park boundaries included Biscayne Bay, its keys, interior country including what are now Homestead and Florida City, and Key Largo. Biscayne Bay, Key Largo and the adjoining inland extensions were cut from Everglades National Park before its establishment in 1947. When proposals to develop Elliott Key surfaced in 1960, Lloyd Miller asked Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall to send a Park Service reconnaissance team to review the Biscayne Bay area for inclusion in the national park system. A favorable report ensued, and with financial help from Herbert Hoover, Jr., political support was solicited, most notably from Congressman Fascell. A area of Elliott Key was by this time a part of the Dade County park system. The 1966 report noted the proposed park contained the best remaining areas of tropical forest in Florida and a rare combination of &quot;terrestrial, marine and amphibious life,&quot; as well as significant recreational value. The report found the most significant virtues of the potential park were &quot;the clear, sparkling waters, marine life, and the submerged lands of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Here in shallow water is a veritable wonderland.&quot;

President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Public Law 90–606 to create Biscayne National Monument on October 18, 1968. The monument was expanded in 1974 under Public Law 93-477 and expanded again when the monument was redesignated a national park by an act of Congress through Public Law 96-287, effective June 28, 1980. The 1980 expansion extended the park almost to Key Biscayne and included Boca Chita Key, the Ragged Keys and the Safety Valve shoal region, together with the corresponding offshore reefs and a substantial portion of central Biscayne Bay.

The first Islandia property owner to sell land to the National Park Service was Lancelot Jones, together with Katherine Jones, Arthur&#x27;s widow. They sold their lands for $1,272,500, about a third of the potential development value. Jones was given a life estate on at the age of 70. He visited with park rangers stationed at the former Cocolobo Club, which eventually burned down in 1975. The other life estate in the park was held by Virginia Tannehill, the widow of Eastern Airlines executive Paul Tannehill. Jones&#x27; house built by Lancelot, his father and his brother, burned down in 1982. He lived in a two-room shack for the next ten years, riding out hurricanes on Porgy Key, but left his home permanently just before Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The house was destroyed and Jones remained in Miami until his death in 1997 at 99 years.

Deprived of a rationale for existence by the national monument&#x27;s establishment, Islandia languished. The hiring of a police chief in 1989 prompted questions from the National Park Service to the Dade County state attorney&#x27;s office, headed by Janet Reno. In 1990 Reno&#x27;s office determined after investigation that all of the town&#x27;s elections were invalid, since the elections were restricted only to landowners, not residents. The town was finally abolished by the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners in March 2012.

The impact of Hurricane Andrew on neighboring Homestead Air Force Base caused the Air Force to consider closing the base and conveying it to Miami-Dade County, which was interested in using the base for commercial air traffic as an alternative to Miami International Airport. An environmental impact study concluded the resulting flight paths over the bay, only to the east, would result in degradation of the park. In 1999 The Air Force prohibited major commercial development at Homestead as a result.

The park&#x27;s popularity as a destination for boaters has led to a high rate of accidents, some of them fatal. The Columbus Day weekend has been cited as the &quot;most dangerous weekend of the year.&quot; An annual boating regatta in its 57th year in 2012 resulted in six deaths between 2002 and 2011, with damage to seabeds from vessel groundings and littering. Although official regatta activities take place outside the park, the area of Elliott Key has become a popular destination for some participants.

A fifth generating unit fueled by natural gas and oil was added to the Turkey Point generating station in 2007. In 2009, Turkey Point was proposed as the site of two new 1117 MW AP1000 nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami-Dade County, a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary at Black Point, and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.

==Activities==

Biscayne National Park operates year-round. Camping is most practical in winter months, when mosquitoes are less troublesome on the keys. The Biscayne National Park Institute provides half and full day tours in the park that include snorkeling, hiking, paddling and sailing from the park headquarters. Boat excursions to Boca Chita Key and the area&#x27;s lighthouses are also available. Licensed private concessionaires provide guided fishing, snorkeling, sailing, and sightseeing tours.

===Recreation===
Access to the park from the mainland is limited to the immediate vicinity of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Convoy Point. All other portions of the park are reachable only by private or concessioner boats. Activities include boating, fishing, kayaking, windsurfing, snorkeling and scuba diving. Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near the park. Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent to the park headquarters at Convoy Point. Farther south Black Point Park provides access to Adams and Elliott Keys. Matheson Hammock Park is near the north end of the park, and Crandon Park is on Key Biscayne.

Although it is a federally designated park, fishing within Biscayne is governed by the state of Florida. Anglers in Biscayne are required to have a Florida recreational saltwater fishing license. Fishing is limited to designated sport fish, spiny lobster, stone crab, blue crab and shrimp. Tropical reef fish may not be collected, nor may sharks, conch, sea urchins and other marine life. Reef life species such as coral and sponges are also protected from collecting by visitors. Additionally, lobstering is prohibited in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary, administered by the state of Florida to protect spiny lobster breeding areas, which overlaps much of Biscayne Bay.

A private concessioner provides tours from the Park headquarters into the bay and to the keys. Most tours are operated during the peak winter season from January to April. Personal watercraft are prohibited in Biscayne and most other national parks, but other private powerboats and sailboats are permitted.

===Island facilities===
Most of Biscayne&#x27;s permanent facilities are on the offshore keys. A seasonally staffed ranger station is on Elliott Key, as well as a campground and 36 boat slips. A single loop trail runs from the harbor to the oceanfront, and a path following the Spite Highway runs the length of the island. Adams Key is a day-use-only area for visitors, although two Park Service residences are on the island. Boca Chita Key is the most-visited island, with a campground and picnic areas. The Boca Chita Lighthouse is occasionally open to visitors when staffing permits.

===Snorkeling and diving===
Snorkeling and scuba diving on the offshore reefs are popular activities. The reefs have been the cause of many shipwrecks. A selection of wrecks have been the subjects of ranger-led snorkeling tours and have been organized as the Maritime Heritage Trail, the only underwater archaeological trail in the National Park Service system. The wrecks of the &quot;Arratoon Apcar&quot; (sank 1878), &quot;Erl King&quot; (1891), &quot;Alicia&quot; (1905), &quot;Lugano&quot; (1913) and &quot;Mandalay&quot; (1966) are on the trail together with an unknown wreck from the 1800s and the Fowey Rocks Lighthouse. The &quot;Alicia&quot;, &quot;Erl King&quot; and &quot;Lugano&quot; are relatively deep wrecks, best suited for scuba dives. The &quot;Mandalay&quot; is at a shallower depth and is especially popular for snorkeling.

==Historical structures==
Although most of Biscayne National Park&#x27;s area is water, the islands have a number of protected historical structures and districts. Shipwrecks are also protected within the park, and the park&#x27;s offshore waters are a protected historic district.

===Stiltsville===
Stiltsville was established by Eddie &quot;Crawfish&quot; Walker in the 1930s as a small community of shacks built on pilings in a shallow section of Biscayne Bay, not far from Key Biscayne. Comprising 27 structures at its height in the 1960s, Stiltsville lost shacks to fires and hurricanes, with only six surviving in 2021, none of them dating to the 1960s or earlier. The site was incorporated into Biscayne National Park in 1985, when the Park Service agreed to honor existing leases until July 1, 1999. Hurricane Andrew destroyed most of Stiltsville in 1992. The Park Service has undertaken to preserve the community, which is now unoccupied. The community is to be administered by a trust and used as accommodation for overnight camping, educational facilities and researchers.

===Other structures===
Biscayne National Park includes a number of navigational aids, as well as an ornamental structure built to resemble a lighthouse. The Fowey Rocks Light is a skeleton-frame cast iron structure built in 1878. Already included within the boundaries of the park, the light was acquired by the Park Service on October 2, 2012. The unmanned Pacific Reef Light is about offshore from Elliott Key. The original 1921 structure was replaced in 2000 and its lantern was placed on display in a park in Islamorada.

Industrialist Mark C. Honeywell was a Cocolobo Club member who bought Boca Chita Key in 1937, expanding the facilities to include a small lighthouse. Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including an imitation lighthouse, built using coral rock and topped with a wire cage resembling a lighthouse lantern, and the end of a jetty on the north side of the key. The key was owned by Honeywell until 1945. Mark and Olive Honeywell also built a chapel, a guesthouse, seawalls and utility buildings on the island.

The Boca Chita Key structures are administered as a cultural landscape, interpreting the area&#x27;s use as a retreat for the rich. More modest homesteads include the now-abandoned plantations developed by Israel Jones and his sons, and the Sweeting Homestead on Elliott Key. The frame structures associated with these plantations, together with those of the Cocolobo Cay Club and frame buildings on Boca Chita Key, have been destroyed by fire and hurricanes.

==Ecology==

South Florida is a transitional zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical realms, resulting in a wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of realms brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh water flows in.

Hundreds of species of fish are present in park waters, including more than fifty crustacean species ranging from isopods to giant blue land crabs, about two hundred species of birds and about 27 mammal species, both terrestrial and marine. Molluscs include a variety of bivalves, terrestrial and marine snails, sea hares, sea slugs and two cephalopods, the Caribbean reef octopus and the Caribbean reef squid.

The sheltered open waters of the bay and the outlying chain of keys provide resting areas for migrating birds on their way between North American, the Caribbean islands, and South America. Many southbound land birds stop in the fall at Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, just north of the park on Key Biscayne, before venturing across the open waters of Biscayne Bay. Northbound spring migrants do likewise on Elliott Key. Most of the small passerine migrants are warblers, with ovenbirds, palm warblers, American redstarts, common yellowthroats, prairie warblers, worm-eating warblers and black-throated blue warblers accounting for the majority. Migrant raptors include short-tailed hawks, sharp-shinned hawks, merlins, peregrine falcons and swallow-tailed kites, while bald eagles and ospreys nest in the park. Both white-tailed and red-tailed tropicbirds are seen in the park, as are American flamingos, with some of the latter probably escaped captive birds.

===Shoreline and mangrove swamp===

The mainland shorelines are dominated by a marshy transitional zone chiefly populated by red mangrove and black mangrove growing from the shallow water, with white mangrove growing farther back from the water&#x27;s edge. The trees&#x27; aerial root structure provides a sheltered habitat for crabs, fish and wading birds. The brown waters within the mangrove thickets are nurseries for fish, mollusc and crustacean larvae that require a quiet sheltered environment before the immature animals can disperse into open waters. Mangroves shed leaves at about per year, providing food for fish, worms and crustaceans. Because the carbon in the leaves is sequestered by incorporation into animals, the mangrove swamp is estimated to have two to three times the ability to sequester carbon of terrestrial forests. The mangrove forest on Biscayne Bay is the longest on Florida&#x27;s east coast. Shoreline and island mangrove swamps, together with the bay, represent a significant nursery for the marine life of southeast Florida.

The salt-tolerant mangrove margin has expanded inland as freshwater flow into the bay has been channelized, replacing freshwater sawgrass marshes. The L-31E coastal storm surge levee inland of the park&#x27;s western boundary has played a significant role in isolating former freshwater marshlands from their water sources. At the same time, tidal water does not reach the interior of the coastal margin, limiting interchange between salt and freshwater ecosystems.

Bird life on the shoreline includes yellow-crowned night herons, loggerhead shrikes, prairie warblers and shorebirds. Mangrove cuckoos, a notoriously difficult-to-observe species, may be seen at Convoy Point and Black Point. Biscayne has one of the largest populations of mangrove cuckoos in Florida.

The park&#x27;s margins are habitat for the threatened American crocodile. The construction of miles of cooling water canals in the marl lands close to the shore behind the Turkey Point power plant, and the canals&#x27; warm waters, have provided a nearly ideal environment for crocodile nesting, making the power plant a nursery for many of those living in the park. Although crocodiles and American alligators both occur in extreme southern Florida, alligators are uncommon in Biscayne, since alligators mainly inhabit fresh waters found farther inland, while crocodiles can live in Biscayne&#x27;s somewhat saltier estuarine waters.

===Bay waters===

The open waters are inhabited by fishes, molluscs and crustaceans living on sea grasses or who prey on each other. The shallowness of the lagoon makes it suitable habitat for diving birds such as anhinga, cormorants and diving ducks. The bay also provides habitat for juvenile sea animals that have left the shelter of the mangrove belts. Manatees frequent the quiet waters of the bay. The bay has a year-round population of double-crested cormorants. Winter residents include northern gannets, American white pelicans and common loons. The bay also has a resident population of common bottlenose dolphins.

Biscayne Bay is a shallow lagoon with little vertical density or salinity gradient due to its lack of depth. Instead of a vertical gradient, the bay shows a horizontal density gradient, with fresh water entering from the drainage canals on the west side and seawater entering through gaps in the keys and through the safety valve section of shoals. Bay salinity reaches a peak in June. Changes in the salinity pattern of the bay have had negative effects on formerly abundant species such as red drum. Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay are major nurseries for red grouper and gray snapper. The bottom of the lagoon hosts sponges and soft corals in places where grasses cannot not grow. Three primary species of seagrass are found in the park: turtlegrass, shoal grass and manatee grass. Johnson&#x27;s seagrass is also found in small quantities in the bay, which is at the southern end of the grass&#x27;s range. Roughly 75 percent of the central bay floor is covered by grasses. Scarring of seagrass beds by vessel groundings or propellers is a significant problem. About 200 such incidents are documented each year, with full re-growth requiring up to 15 years. The bay is also affected by commercial shrimp trawling, which is permitted in park waters. The passage of roller-frame trawl nets does not harm grasses, but damages soft corals and sponges.

===Keys===
Elliott Key is the largest island in the park, measuring and about long by wide. Next largest is Old Rhodes Key at , then Sands Key , Totten Key and Little Totten Key at , with 37 smaller islands arranged in a north–south line east of the mainland shoreline. The keys shift from barrier islands with rocky cores in the north to coral rock platforms in the south. All are fringed with mangroves, with subtropical vegetation and hardwood forests in the interiors, including gumbo limbo, mahogany, ironwood, torchwood and satinleaf. Insects include Schaus&#x27; swallowtail, an endangered species, as well as dense clouds of mosquitoes in the wet season, preyed upon by dragonflies. Marsh rabbits and raccoons, together with mice and rats comprise the primary mammalian species. Reptiles include rattlesnakes and a variety of lizards, as well as an occasional crocodile.

The keys are a transitional area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland. The interior of the keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for ruddy turnstones and least sandpipers. Gulls and terns include royal terns, laughing gulls and ring-billed gulls, with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson&#x27;s plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones are closed during breeding season.

Sea turtles nest on island beaches in the park. Park staff actively assist turtle nesting by removing debris from beaches that might pose an obstacle to adults and hatchlings. Loggerhead turtles are the most common sea turtle species and account for nearly all of the turtle nests in the park. Nest sites are identified by daily morning beach patrols and are protected with mesh screen against the predation by abundant raccoon population. Nest protection efforts have reduced predation from 100% of nests disturbed per year to no disturbed nests in 2007, with a more usual average of more than 50% nest disturbance in most years. In 2012 one undisturbed nest was found and protected, five partially disturbed nests were protected, and one nest was destroyed by predators. The threatened eastern indigo snake is also present on the island.

Rare and endangered plant species on the islands include Sargent&#x27;s cherry palm and the semaphore prickly-pear cactus (&quot;Consolea corallicola&quot;). The cactus, which has been described as &quot;near extinction&quot;, has been reduced to about 20 individuals. A colonial population of 570 cacti were found on one island in Biscayne Bay in 2001, making it the largest known population of semaphore prickly-pear cactus in the world. The only natural population of Sargent&#x27;s palm grows on Elliott Key. Fewer than 50 grew on the key in 1991. Despite efforts to propagate the plant, there are now 16 Sargent&#x27;s palms on Elliott Key, with about 123 propagated on Long Key.

Two critically endangered butterflies, Schaus&#x27; swallowtail (&quot;Papilio aristodemus&quot;) and the Miami blue, are found in the park, mostly on Elliott Key. In 2012 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) authorized a capture and captive breeding program for Schaus&#x27; swallowtail after only five of the butterflies were found by surveyors in the park, down from 35 in 2011, of a total surveyed Florida population of 41. The Miami blue was feared to be extinct after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, but a population was found in 1999 at Bahia Honda Key. Captive breeding produced 25,000 Miami blues, some of which have been released on Elliott Key with mixed results.

===Coral reef and offshore waters===

Beyond the keys in the Atlantic Ocean the seafloor slopes gradually down before rising in an almost continuous coral reef. The reef, composed of living corals, is inhabited by more than 200 species of fish, as well as molluscs, crustaceans and worms. Every coral species in park waters is considered protected by either federal or state regulations. Coral reefs are estimated to cover about half the area of the park, with about 4000 individual patch reefs and areas of bank-barrier reef. Hundreds of species of hard and soft corals, sea anemones and sponges are found in bay and offshore waters. The coral reefs may themselves be subdivided into the outer reef on the edge of the Florida carbonate platform, the patch reefs between the outer reef and the keys, and the reefs in the shoals on either side of the keys. The offshore reefs are dominated by elkhorn coral to water depth, and staghorn coral below 10 meters. The landward patch reefs are principally composed of boulder star coral and symmetrical brain coral. The island shoal reefs mainly consist of lesser starlet coral and &quot;Porites&quot; finger corals.

Reef environments in Biscayne National Park have seen declines in species richness and diversity across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract and the decline in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.

The park&#x27;s eastern boundary lies just beyond the rise of the offshore reef at ten-fathom () sea depth. Areas farther offshore are protected within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which extends eastward to a boundary corresponding to a depth of . The offshore waters harbor brown pelicans, magnificent frigatebirds, brown boobies, particularly around the offshore lights, and pelagic birds such as shearwaters and petrels. Whales in offshore waters are rare, but can include right whales, humpback whales, sperm whales, fin whales and sei whales, all of them endangered. The smalltooth sawfish is similarly rare in park waters and endangered. Threatened coral species include elkhorn and staghorn corals, as well as pillar coral, listed as endangered in Florida.

===Exotic species===

More than 50 species of exotic plant have been documented in the park, with almost 20 of those considered to be pest species which may displace native plants and possibly alter the ecological balance. Green iguanas, cane toads, black rats, lionfish, fire ants, oscars and brown basilisk lizards are common in the park. The lionfish (&quot;Pterois volitans&quot; and &quot;Pterois miles&quot;) is a tropical fish from the Indian-Pacific Ocean area. It is known for its voracious appetite and its ability to establish itself in new waters, rapidly replacing other species. Researchers theorized the introduction of this species in the park occurred during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Sightings in Biscayne Bay at that time were believed to have been from home aquariums destroyed during the hurricane, though the researcher who first proposed the theory has since retracted the assertion. More recent lionfish sightings are probably from more established populations in the Florida Keys to the south of the park. Also likely originating from human captivity, Burmese pythons have been observed near the park&#x27;s boundary along the mainland. Exotic plant species which pose the highest risk to native plant communities include Brazilian-pepper, torpedo grass, tuberous sword fern, guava and portiatree.

==Climate==

Biscayne&#x27;s tropical climate reflects its location in extreme South Florida. Southern Miami-Dade County is classified as having a tropical savanna climate in the Köppen-Geiger system, with the park bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. Seasons may be divided into the November–April dry season and the May–October wet season. Dry season temperatures average between with an average monthly rainfall of . Wet season temperatures average between with an average monthly rainfall of . The wet season roughly coincides with hurricane season, with frequent thunderstorms.

Like many locations in southern Florida, Biscayne National Park is affected by hurricanes every few years. Most storms require temporary closings and occasional repairs to park facilities. A direct hit by a powerful hurricane can produce severe consequences, primarily by its impact on human interventions in the environment rather than on the natural environment of the park, which is well-adapted to these events. Significant hurricanes to strike Biscayne include storms in 1835 and 1904, the 1906 Florida Keys hurricane, the 1926 Miami hurricane, the 1929 Bahamas hurricane, the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, the 1935 Yankee hurricane, the 1941 Florida hurricane, the 1945 Southeast Florida hurricane, the 1948 Miami hurricane, Hurricane King in 1950, Hurricane Donna in 1960. Hurricane Cleo in 1964, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The park can be affected by wave action from more distant tropical storms such as 2012&#x27;s Hurricane Sandy, which damaged facilities on Elliott Key.

On August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew came ashore just south of Miami, passing directly across Biscayne National Park with maximum sustained winds of , with gusts to . The storm surge was up to above mean sea level. It was a compact Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Biscayne Bay was affected by bottom scouring and turbidity and with damage to its fringes of mangrove forest. Leakage from damaged boats and marinas polluted the bay with fuel, with discharges continuing for nearly a month after the hurricane&#x27;s passage. A commemorative plaque was placed at the Dante Fascell Visitor Center in 2002 to commemorate the human and environmental cost of Andrew, and to celebrate the area&#x27;s recovery from the storm&#x27;s effects. The inscription reads in part:

On Monday, August 24, 1992, at 4:30 a.m., the eye wall of Hurricane Andrew
passed over this point before striking Homestead and southern Miami-Dade County.

The Fowey Rocks light station transmitted weather data with winds peaking at a two-minute wind speed of and a gust to before the station ceased transmitting, presumably due to damage from stronger gusts. The strongest part of the eyewall had not reached Fowey Rocks when it stopped transmitting.

Since all park lands are no more than a few feet above sea level, they are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Park Service studies project that much of the park&#x27;s land area will be lost in the next two hundred years. Sea level in Biscayne Bay is projected to rise between by 2030, and by 2060. A sea level rise of is projected to increase saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne Aquifer. Higher rises will make the southern Everglades a saltwater marsh, altering the ecology of the region.

<text>The Seventh Seal () is a 1957 Swedish historical fantasy film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play &quot;Wood Painting&quot;. The title refers to a passage from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film and again towards the end, beginning with the words &quot;And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.&quot; Here, the motif of silence refers to the &quot;silence of God,&quot; which is a major theme of the film.

&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; is considered a classic in the history of cinema, as well as one of the greatest films of all time. It established Bergman as a director, containing scenes which have become iconic through homages, critical analysis, and parodies.

==Plot==

Disillusioned knight Antonius Block and his cynical squire Jöns return from the Crusades to find the country ravaged by the plague. The knight encounters Death, whom he challenges to a chess match, believing he can survive as long as the game continues.
The knight and his squire pass a caravan of actors: Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son Mikael and actor-manager Jonas Skat. Waking early, Jof has a vision of Mary leading the infant Jesus, which he relates to a smilingly disbelieving Mia.

Block and Jöns visit a church where a fresco of the &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; is being painted. The squire chides the artist for colluding in the ideological fervor that led to the crusade. In the confessional, Block tells the priest he wants to perform &quot;one meaningful deed&quot; after what he now sees as a pointless life. Upon revealing to him the chess tactic that will save his life, the knight discovers that it is actually Death with whom he has been speaking. Leaving the church, Block speaks to a young woman condemned to be burned at the stake for consorting with the Devil. He believes she will tell him about life beyond death, only to find that she is insane.

In a deserted village, Jöns saves a mute servant girl from being raped by Raval, a theologian who ten years earlier persuaded the knight to join the Crusades and is now a thief. Jöns vows to destroy his face if they meet again. Jöns kisses the servant girl, who resists his advances. He then tells her to repay her debt by becoming his servant. She reluctantly agrees. The group goes into town, where the actors are performing. There, Skat is enticed away for a tryst by Lisa, wife of the blacksmith Plog. The stage show is interrupted by a procession of flagellants led by a preacher who harangues the townspeople.

At the town&#x27;s inn, Raval manipulates Plog and other customers into intimidating Jof. The bullying is broken up by Jöns, who slashes Raval&#x27;s face. The knight and squire are joined by Jof&#x27;s family and a repentant Plog. Block enjoys a picnic of milk and wild strawberries that Mia has gathered and promises to remember that evening for the rest of his life.

He then invites Plog and the actors to shelter from the plague in his castle. When they encounter Skat and Lisa in the forest, she returns to Plog, while Skat fakes a remorseful suicide. As the group moves on, Skat climbs a tree to spend the night, but Death appears beneath and cuts down the tree.

Meeting the condemned woman being drawn to execution, Block asks her to summon Satan so he can question him about God. The girl claims she has done so, but the knight only sees her terror and gives her herbs to take away her pain as she is placed on the pyre.
They encounter Raval, stricken by the plague. Jöns stops the servant girl from uselessly bringing him water, and Raval dies alone. Jof then sees the knight playing chess with Death and decides to flee with his family, while Block knowingly keeps Death occupied.

As Death states &quot;No one escapes me&quot;, Block knocks the chess pieces over but Death restores them to their place. On the next move, Death wins the game and announces that when they meet again, it will be the last time for all. Death then asks Block if he achieved the &quot;meaningful deed&quot; he wished to accomplish. The knight replies that he has.

Block is reunited with his wife and the party shares a final supper, interrupted by Death&#x27;s arrival. The other members of the party then introduce themselves, and the mute servant girl greets him with &quot;It is finished.&quot;

Jof and his family have sheltered in their caravan from a storm, which he interprets as the Angel of Death passing by. In the morning, Jof sees a vision of the knight and his companions being led away over the hillside in a Dance of Death.

==Themes==
The title refers to a passage about the end of the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words &quot;And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour&quot; (Revelation 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: &quot;Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren&#x27;t able to?&quot; Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block states: &quot;Faith is a torment – did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call.&quot; Melvyn Bragg notes that the concept of the &quot;Silence of God&quot; in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman&#x27;s father, a chaplain in the State Lutheran Church. In Bergman&#x27;s original radio play sometimes translated as &quot;A Painting on Wood&quot;, the figure of Death in a Dance of Death is represented not by an actor, but by silence, &quot;mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void.&quot;

Some of the powerful influences on the film were Picasso&#x27;s picture of the two acrobats, Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, Strindberg&#x27;s dramas &quot;Folkungasagan&quot; (&quot;The Saga of the Folkung Kings&quot;) and &quot;The Road to Damascus&quot;, the frescoes at Härkeberga church, and a painting by Albertus Pictor in Täby church. Just prior to shooting, Bergman directed for radio the play &quot;Everyman&quot; by Hugo von Hofmannsthal. By this time he had also directed plays by Shakespeare, Strindberg, Camus, Chesterton, Anouilh, Tennessee Williams, Pirandello, Lehár, Molière and Ostrovsky. The actors Bibi Andersson (with whom Bergman was in a relationship from 1955 to 1959) who played the juggler&#x27;s wife Mia, and Max von Sydow, whose role as the knight was the first of many star parts he would bring to Bergman&#x27;s films and whose rugged Nordic dignity became a vital resource within Bergman&#x27;s &quot;troupe&quot; of key actors, both made a strong impact on the mood and style of the film.

Bergman grew up in a home infused with an intense Christianity, his father being a charismatic rector (this may have explained Bergman&#x27;s adolescent infatuation with Hitler, which later deeply tormented him). As a six-year-old child, Bergman used to help the gardener carry corpses from the Royal Hospital Sophiahemmet (where his father was chaplain) to the mortuary. When as a boy he saw the film &quot;Black Beauty&quot;, the fire scene excited him so much he stayed in bed for three days with a temperature. Despite living a Bohemian lifestyle in partial rebellion against his upbringing, Bergman often signed his scripts with the initials &quot;S.D.G&quot; (&quot;Soli Deo Gloria&quot;) — &quot;To God Alone the Glory&quot; — just as J. S. Bach did at the end of every musical composition.

Gerald Mast writes:
&quot;Like the gravedigger in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the Squire [...] treats death as a bitter and hopeless joke. Since we all play chess with death, and since we all must suffer through that hopeless joke, the only question about the game is how long it will last and how well we will play it. To play it well, to live, is to love and not to hate the body and the mortal as the Church urges in Bergman&#x27;s metaphor.&quot;

Melvyn Bragg writes:
&quot;[I]t is constructed like an argument. It is a story told as a sermon might be delivered: an allegory...each scene is at once so simple and so charged and layered that it catches us again and again...Somehow all of Bergman&#x27;s own past, that of his father, that of his reading and doing and seeing, that of his Swedish culture, of his political burning and religious melancholy, poured into a series of pictures which carry that swell of contributions and contradictions so effortlessly that you could tell the story to a child, publish it as a storybook of photographs and yet know that the deepest questions of religion and the most mysterious revelation of simply being alive are both addressed.&quot;

The Jesuit publication &quot;America&quot; identifies it as having begun &quot;a series of seven films that explored the possibility of faith in a post-Holocaust, nuclear age&quot;. Likewise, film historians Thomas W. Bohn and Richard L. Stromgren identify this film as beginning &quot;his cycle of films dealing with the conundrum of religious faith&quot;.

===Portrait of the Middle Ages===
Medieval Sweden as portrayed in this movie includes creative anachronisms. The flagellant movement was foreign to Sweden, and large-scale witch persecutions only began in the 15th century. In addition, the main period of the Crusades is well before this era; they took place in a more optimistic period.

With regard to the relevancy of historical accuracy to a film that is heavily metaphorical and allegorical, John Aberth, writing in &quot;A Knight at the Movies&quot;, holds

the film only partially succeeds in conveying the period atmosphere and thought world of the fourteenth century. Bergman would probably counter that it was never his intention to make an historical or period film. As it was written in a program note that accompanied the movie&#x27;s premier &quot;It is a modern poem presented with medieval material that has been very freely handled... The script in particular—embodies a mid-twentieth century existentialist angst... Still, to be fair to Bergman, one must allow him his artistic license, and the script&#x27;s modernisms may be justified as giving the movie&#x27;s medieval theme a compelling and urgent contemporary relevance... Yet the film succeeds to a large degree because it is set in the Middle Ages, a time that can seem both very remote and very immediate to us living in the modern world... Ultimately &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; should be judged as a historical film by how well it combines the medieval and the modern.&quot;

Similarly defending it as an allegory, Aleksander Kwiatkowski in the book &quot;Swedish Film Classics&quot;, writes

The international response to the film which among other awards won the jury&#x27;s special prize at Cannes in 1957 reconfirmed the author&#x27;s high rank and proved that &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; regardless of its degree of accuracy in reproducing medieval scenery may be considered as a universal, timeless allegory.
Much of the film&#x27;s imagery is derived from medieval art. For example, Bergman has stated that the image of a man playing chess with a skeletal Death was inspired by a medieval church painting from the 1480s in Täby kyrka, Täby, north of Stockholm, painted by Albertus Pictor.

Generally speaking, historians Johan Huizinga, Friedrich Heer and Barbara Tuchman have all argued that the Late Middle Ages of the 14th century was a period of &quot;doom and gloom&quot; similar to what is reflected in this film, characterized by a feeling of pessimism, an increase in a penitential style of piety that was slightly masochistic, all aggravated by various disasters such as the Black Death, famine, the Hundred Years&#x27; War between France and England, and the Papal schism. This is sometimes called the crisis of the Late Middle Ages, and Tuchman regards the 14th century as &quot;a distant mirror&quot; of the 20th century in a way that echoes Bergman&#x27;s sensibilities.

==Production==
===Development===

Ingmar Bergman originally wrote the play &quot;Trämålning&quot; (&quot;Wood Painting&quot;) in 1953 / 1954 for the acting students of Malmö City Theatre. Its first public performance, which he directed, was on radio in 1954. He also directed it on stage in Malmö the next spring, and in the autumn it was staged in Stockholm, directed by Bengt Ekerot, who would later play the character Death in the film version.

In his autobiography, &quot;The Magic Lantern&quot;, Bergman wrote that &quot;&quot;Wood Painting&quot; gradually became &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, an uneven film which lies close to my heart, because it was made under difficult circumstances in a surge of vitality and delight.&quot; The script for &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; was commenced while Bergman was in the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm recovering from a stomach complaint. It was at first rejected by Carl-Anders Dymling, head of Svensk Filmindustri and Bergman was given the go-ahead for the project from Carl-Anders Dymling only after the success at Cannes of &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot;. Bergman rewrote the script five times and was given a schedule of only thirty-five days and a budget of $150,000. It was to be the seventeenth film he had directed.

===Filming===
All scenes except two were shot in or around the Filmstaden studios in Solna. The exceptions were the famous opening scene with Death and the Knight playing chess by the sea, and the ending with the dance of death, which were both shot at Hovs Hallar, a rocky, precipitous beach area in north-western Scania.

In the &quot;Magic Lantern&quot; autobiography Bergman writes of the film&#x27;s iconic penultimate shot: &quot;The image of the Dance of Death beneath the dark cloud was achieved at hectic speed because most of the actors had finished for the day. Assistants, electricians, and a make-up man and about two summer visitors, who never knew what it was all about, had to dress up in the costumes of those condemned to death. A camera with no sound was set up and the picture shot before the cloud dissolved.&quot;

==Reception==
Upon its original Swedish release, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; was met with a somewhat divided critical response; its cinematography was widely praised, while &quot;Bergman the scriptwriter [was] lambasted.&quot; The film won the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Non-Italian Film in 1961. Swedish journalist and critic Nils Beyer, writing for &quot;Morgon-tidningen&quot;, compared it to Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; and &quot;Day of Wrath&quot;. While finding Dreyer&#x27;s films to be superior, he still noted that &quot;it isn&#x27;t just any director that you feel like comparing to the old Danish master.&quot; He also praised the usage of the cast, in particular Max von Sydow, whose character he described as &quot;a pale, serious Don Quixote character with a face as if sculpted in wood&quot;, and &quot;Bibi Andersson, who appears as if painted in faded watercolours but still can emit small delicious glimpses of female warmth.&quot; Hanserik Hjertén for &quot;Arbetaren&quot; started his review by praising the cinematography, but soon went on to describe the film as &quot;a horror film for children&quot; and said that beyond the superficial, it is mostly reminiscent of Bergman&#x27;s &quot;sophomoric films from the 40s.&quot;

Bergman&#x27;s international reputation, on the other hand, was largely cemented by &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;. The film ranked 2nd on Cahiers du Cinéma&#x27;s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1958. Bosley Crowther had only positive things to say in his 1958 review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and praised how the themes were elevated by the cinematography and performances: &quot;the profundities of the ideas are lightened and made flexible by glowing pictorial presentation of action that is interesting and strong. Mr. Bergman uses his camera and actors for sharp, realistic effects.&quot; Film critic Pauline Kael called it &quot;A magically powerful film.&quot;

The film is now regarded as a masterpiece of cinema. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; at number 33 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was included in &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; in 2002. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, in 2010, ranked it the eighth-greatest film of world cinema. In a poll held by the same magazine, it was voted 335th &#x27;Greatest Movie of All Time&#x27; from a list of 500. In addition, on the 100th anniversary of cinema in 1995, the Vatican included &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; in its list of its 45 &quot;great films&quot; for its thematic values. The film was included in film critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot; in 2000. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it at No. 45 on their list of &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. In 2007, the film was ranked at No. 13 by The Guardian&#x27;s readers poll on the list of &quot;40 greatest foreign films of all time&quot;. Indian film maker Adoor Gopalakrishnan praised the film saying &quot;One can watch &#x27;Seventh Seal&#x27; even without subtitles as it is most appealing to the eye.&quot; In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 82 on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Essential Films of All Time&quot; by the National Society of Film Critics. In 2012, the film ranked 93rd on critic&#x27;s poll and 75th on director&#x27;s poll in Sight &amp; Sound magazine&#x27;s 100 greatest films of all time list. In the earlier 2002 version of the list the film ranked 35th in critic&#x27;s poll and 31st in director&#x27;s poll. In 2022 edition of Sight &amp; Sound&#x27;s &quot;Greatest films of all time&quot; list the film ranked 72nd in the director&#x27;s poll. In 2012 it was voted one of the 25 best Swedish films of all time by a poll of 50 film critics and academics conducted by film magazine FLM. In 2018 the film was ranked 30th in BBC&#x27;s list of The 100 greatest foreign language films. In 2021 the film was ranked at No. 43 on Time Out magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 best movies of all time&quot;.

The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 30th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 72 reviews, with an average rating of 9.20/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Narratively bold and visually striking, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; brought Ingmar Bergman to the world stage – and remains every bit as compelling today&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 88/100 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

==Influence==
&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; significantly helped Bergman in gaining his position as a world-class director. When the film won the Special Jury Prize at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, the attention generated by it (along with the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Smiles of a Summer Night&quot;) made Bergman and his stars Max von Sydow and Bibi Andersson well known to the European film community, and the critics and readers of &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, among others, discovered him with this movie. Within five years of this, he had established himself as the first real auteur of Swedish cinema. With its images and reflections upon death and the meaning of life, &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; had a symbolism that was &quot;immediately apprehensible to people trained in literary culture who were just beginning to discover the &#x27;art&#x27; of film, and it quickly became a staple of high school and college literature courses... Unlike Hollywood &#x27;movies,&#x27; &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; clearly was aware of elite artistic culture and thus was readily appreciated by intellectual audiences.&quot;

=== Film and television ===

The representation of Death as a white-faced man who wears a dark cape and plays chess with mortals has been a popular object of parody in other films and television.

Several films and comedy sketches portray Death as playing games other than or in addition to chess. In the final scene of the 1968 film &quot;De Düva&quot; (mock Swedish for &quot;The Dove&quot;), a 15-minute pastiche of Bergman&#x27;s work generally and his &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; in particular, the protagonist plays badminton against Death, and wins when the droppings of a passing dove strike Death in the eye. The photography imitates throughout the style of Bergman&#x27;s cinematographers Sven Nykvist and Gunnar Fischer. The film is also parodied in &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; (1991), with the titular characters meeting Death and challenging him to several contemporary games.

=== Popular music ===
The film is referred to in several songs. The plot is recapitulated in Scott Walker&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; from his album &quot;Scott 4&quot;. There is a passing reference in Bruce Cockburn&#x27;s song &quot;How I Spent My Fall Vacation&quot;, from his album &quot;Humans&quot;, in which the song&#x27;s narrative is bracketed by two young men watching the film in a cinema. On Iron Maiden&#x27;s album &quot;Dance of Death&quot; (2003), the title track was inspired by the final scene of &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; where, according to guitarist Janick Gers, &quot;these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death.&quot; The song &quot;The Hawthorne Passage&quot; from Agalloch&#x27;s Album The Mantle contains an audio sample from the scene in which Antonious first meets Death. The music video for the song Show Yourself by the heavy metal band Mastodon features a brief parody of the film, in which the grim reaper is seen playing chess with a man in a hospital bed.

===Opera===
In 2016, composer João MacDowell premiered in New York City at Scandinavia House the music for the first act of &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;, a work in progress under contract with the Ingmar Bergman Foundation, sung in Swedish. The work was under production by the International Brazilian Opera (IBOC) as part of the celebrations for the Ingmar Bergman centenary in 2018.

<text>Arthur Paul Alexakis (born April 12, 1962) is an American musician best known as the singer-songwriter and guitarist of the rock band Everclear. He has been a member of several other bands in addition to his own work as a songwriter for other artists. Alexakis has founded several record labels throughout his career and worked as an A&amp;R representative for major record labels between and during his own musical projects. Later he became a political activist and lobbied for special concerns which include drug awareness policies and support for the families of the military.

==Early life==
Alexakis was born in Los Angeles, the youngest of five children. When Art was five years old his father left the family, and financial difficulties forced his mother to relocate the family to the Mar Vista Gardens housing project in California, located on the west side of Los Angeles in Del Rey. When Alexakis was 8 years old, he was beaten and sexually assaulted by older children in his neighborhood.

His brother George died of a heroin overdose when Alexakis was 12. That same year, Alexakis&#x27;s 15-year-old girlfriend died by suicide. Not long after her death, Alexakis attempted suicide by filling his pockets with sand and lead weights and jumping off the Santa Monica Pier. Later, he said that the vision and voice of his brother George compelled him to survive. Alexakis started shooting up when he was 13, mostly taking crystal methamphetamine. He became addicted to heroin and cocaine, and he survived a cocaine overdose when he was 22. He quit drugs cold turkey in June 1989.

Alexakis took film classes at Los Angeles Community College.

==Music career==
===Early bands===
While living in Los Angeles in the 1980s, Alexakis was in a band called Shakin&#x27; Brave. Shakin&#x27; Brave featured a rather rough rock sound, but failed to emerge from the sea of music in Southern California. Alexakis and his first wife Anita relocated to San Francisco.

While living in San Francisco, Alexakis discovered a genre of music known as &quot;cowpunk&quot;, a style merging two prevalent forms of music with which he grew up — the tunefulness of country and the distorted guitars/fast tempo of rock and roll. Inspired, Alexakis established Shindig Records. He spent several years with his cowpunk band, the Easy Hoes that formed in the late &#x27;80s and released one album, &quot;Tragic Songs of Life&quot;, in 1989.

Alexakis&#x27;s next project began as a solo album but grew into a group project under the name Colorfinger. This band released the album, &quot;Deep in the Heart of the Beast in the Sun&quot; as well as an EP, &quot;Demonstration&quot;. Only the full-length album was made available for sale. Both were released on Alexakis&#x27;s Shindig Records. A few songs originally performed by Colorfinger were made into Everclear songs, such as &quot;Why I Don&#x27;t Believe in God&quot;, &quot;Invisible,&quot; &quot;The Twistinside&quot;, &quot;Heartspark Dollarsign&quot;, and &quot;Hateful&quot;.

===Everclear===

Following a move to Portland, Alexakis placed an ad in &quot;The Rocket&quot; seeking a bass player and a drummer to form a new band. Alexakis had two respondents, Craig Montoya and Scott Cuthbert. The trio became the first incarnation of Everclear. After Cuthbert was replaced by Greg Eklund, the band spent the better part of a decade as a dominant act on alternative rock radio. The band scored three platinum albums in &quot;Sparkle &amp; Fade&quot;, &quot;So Much for the Afterglow&quot;, and &quot;Songs from an American Movie Vol. One: Learning How to Smile&quot;.

The instability and personal turmoil Alexakis experienced throughout his life would directly inspire his lyrics. &quot;Father of Mine&quot; and &quot;Why I Don&#x27;t Believe in God&quot; described his difficult youth, while &quot;Heroin Girl&quot;, &quot;Strawberry&quot;, and &quot;Color Pit&quot; touched upon his drug addictions. Everclear&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Sparkle &amp; Fade&quot;, deals with the themes of escape and redemption that pervaded his life upon leaving San Francisco.

===Songwriting and industry roles===
While finding success as a musical act and songwriter, Alexakis took on other projects within the music industry. For several years, he served as an A&amp;R representative for Capitol Records. In 1996, he produced Frogpond&#x27;s album, &quot;Count to Ten&quot;.

In the early 2000s, Alexakis established his own label, Popularity Recordings, as a subsidiary of Artemis Records. He produced the label&#x27;s first release, the 2002 album &quot;Volume&quot; by Flipp. The label closed in 2003.

Alexakis dabbled in songwriting with other artists, including co-writing and duetting the song &quot;At the End of the Day&quot; released on Marion Raven&#x27;s 2005 and 2007 albums, &quot;Here I Am&quot; and &quot;Set Me Free&quot;, respectively.

In October 2008, Alexakis entered the studio with the Minneapolis-based band Apparently Nothing (previously a Madison band and later renamed to The Usual Things) to produce their debut album, tentatively titled &quot;The Middle Coast&quot;.

==Radio==
From March 2017 through February 2019, Alexakis hosted a weekly radio show on Sirius XM&#x27;s 1990s alternative and grunge music channel, Lithium (Channel 34).

==Film and television==
In 2000, Alexakis made brief appearances in the Heather Graham comedy &quot;Committed&quot;. He played the lead role in the 2006 short film &quot;Room to Breathe&quot; and had parts in &quot;Rid of Me&quot; (2011) and &quot;Rogue River&quot; (2012).

Alexakis was interviewed on &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;; the interview never aired, although it is briefly glimpsed on Episode 60, &quot;Lawsuit&quot;. In 2002, Alexakis appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Chris Isaak Show&quot;. In 2006, he appeared on an episode of &quot;Ned&#x27;s Declassified School Survival Guide&quot; on Nickelodeon as a music teacher named Mr. Gibson (a reference to Gibson guitars).

In August 2006, Alexakis appeared on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; discussing the music video for &quot;Hater&quot;, the first single from Everclear&#x27;s &quot;Welcome to the Drama Club&quot;.

In 2014, he had a role as a tattoo artist in the biographical drama film &quot;Wild&quot; starring Reese Witherspoon.

==Political activism==
In 2000, Alexakis testified before Congress in support of HR 1488, the Compassion for Children and Child Support Enforcement Act. Through ACES, the Association of Children for the Enforcement of Support, President Geraldine Jenson and Nancy Pelosi sponsored this bill. The law passed.

Alexakis was a delegate for the 2004 Democratic National Convention representing Oregon&#x27;s 3rd congressional district after campaigning for John Edwards during that year&#x27;s presidential primaries. He and Everclear recorded the Woody Guthrie standard &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, which he performed at several political events.

Alexakis is a gay rights activist. In 2010, he expressed his support for gay marriage and opposition to Proposition 8, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Prop 8, gay marriage or the things your community lobbies for are political issues. We are Americans; that&#x27;s where it ends. If Lady Justice is supposed to be blind, then why not towards your community? It is going to happen; it&#x27;s happening, and I think it is a great thing.&quot; In the same interview, he reflected on the gay rights movement in the 1970s by saying, &quot;I went to San Francisco to see the Sex Pistols in 1978. I was barely 16 and I went with this neighbor of mine, who my mom didn&#x27;t know was gay, but I knew was gay. I went to Castro with a whole group of gay guys and saw a side of the culture that I had never seen before. I was aware of Harvey Milk before most people were. It was a great experience.&quot;

Alexakis has also been involved in drug awareness programs, including the taping of public service announcements for the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Along with Everclear, he has performed for U.S. soldiers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Hawaii, and Abu Dhabi. He has also performed for Snowball Express, which organizes events for military families who lost loved ones in the war.

==Personal life==
During his younger years, Alexakis was an atheist. In an August 2000 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Alexakis stated he had since become Christian. Speaking about his then-fiancée Stephanie Greig, he said, &quot;She&#x27;s a Christian, and I&#x27;m a Christian—my ex isn&#x27;t—and so I was like, it&#x27;s okay to be a Christian. I&#x27;m not like a born-again... Well, I guess I &quot;am&quot; born-again, in a way. But I don&#x27;t knock people over the head with it. I just kind of use my spirituality to make my life better.&quot;

Alexakis has been married at least three times as of 2024: to Jennifer Dodson Paget (with whom he has a daughter, Anna) from 1995 to 1999; to Stephanie Greig from 2000 to 2004; and since 2009, to Vanessa Crawford (with whom he has a daughter, Arizona).

On March 26, 2019, Alexakis announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in a letter to fans posted on the band&#x27;s website. Alexakis says he was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS following a car accident three years prior.

<doc id="176547" wikidata="Q374879" url="?curid=176547" title="Cedar Breaks National Monument">
<text>Cedar Breaks National Monument is a U.S. National Monument located in the U.S. state of Utah near Cedar City. Cedar Breaks is a natural amphitheater, stretching across , with a depth of over . The elevation of the rim of the amphitheater is over above sea level. Rising above the rim is the prominent Brian Head, the peak of which lies a short distance outside of the National Monument boundary.

The rock of the amphitheater is more eroded than, but otherwise similar to, formations at nearby Bryce Canyon National Park, Red Canyon in Dixie National Forest, and select areas of Cedar Mountain (SR-14). Because of its elevation, snow often makes parts of the park inaccessible to vehicles from October through May. Its rim visitor center is open from June through October. Several hundred thousand people visit the monument annually. The monument area is the headwaters of Mammoth Creek, a tributary of the Sevier River.

== Flora and fauna ==
Wildlife can often be seen in this high-altitude setting. Mule deer and porcupines are common, as are rodents and similar animals such as marmots, golden-mantled ground squirrels, pocket gophers, and chipmunks. Mountain lions and other larger animals live in the area but are seldom seen. Common birds include the Clark&#x27;s nutcracker, violet-green swallows, and the common raven.

The bristlecone pine, a species of tree that is known as the longest living single organism, can also be found in the high country, with some local specimens known to be more than 1600 years old. Subalpine meadows dot the canyon rim in such areas as Alpine Pond, which is an easy hike from the road along a clear trail. Aspen, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir trees, and limber pine also grow here.

Spring begins in June at this elevation, when wildflowers cover the canyon rim. Wildflowers bloom all during the short growing season, and visitors can enjoy Colorado columbine, scarlet paintbrush, subalpine larkspur, pretty shooting star, orange sneezeweed, Panguitch buckwheat, prairie smoke, silvery lupin, yellow evening primrose, shrubby cinquefoil, Parry primrose, plantainleaf buttercup, and two species of &quot;Penstemon&quot;.

== History and geology ==
The amphitheater, located near the west end of the Colorado Plateau, covers the west side of the Markagunt Plateau, the same plateau that forms parts of Zion National Park. Uplift and erosion formed the canyon over millions of years, raising and then wearing away the shale, limestone, and sandstone that were deposited at the bottom of an ancient lake , known as Lake Claron, about 60 million years ago. It continues to erode at a pace of about every 5 years. Atop the plateau, much of the area is covered by volcanic rock known as tuff, formed during cataclysmic eruptions around 35 million years ago.

The rocks of the eroded canyon contain iron and manganese in various combinations, providing brilliant colors that led Indians to call it the &quot;Circle of Painted Cliffs&quot;. Iron oxides provide the reds, oranges and yellows, while manganese oxides provide shades of purple. The color of the rock is soft and subtle compared to the hoodoos at Bryce Canyon.

The area is a form of badlands—canyons, spires, walls, and cliffs so steep and confusing that the land, while of great aesthetic value, is of little utilitarian worth. Early settlers called them &quot;badlands&quot; or &quot;breaks&quot; and created the current name by combining &quot;breaks&quot; with &quot;cedar&quot; for the many juniper trees (often incorrectly called cedars) that grow in the area.

Cedar Breaks National Monument was established in 1933. A small lodge designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood and built and operated by the Utah Parks Company once existed near the south end of the monument, but it was razed in 1972. The Cedar Breaks Lodge was the smallest of the park lodges in the Southwest. It was deemed &quot;uneconomical to operate&quot; by the Park Service, but protests associated with its demolition caused the Park Service to re-examine its policies concerning lodges in other parks, contributing to their preservation.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification, the area has a dry-summer subalpine climate (&quot;Dsc&quot;).

== Attractions ==
There are two well-advertised hiking trails in the monument, and a campsite near the canyon rim. Trails range from .6 to 5 miles from easy to moderately strenuous.

== National park proposal ==
In 2006, Iron County officials considered a proposal for legislation to expand the monument and rename it Cedar Breaks National Park. The new park would include the adjacent Ashdown Gorge Wilderness, some private land and nearby Flanigan Arch.

<text>In chemistry, the standard molar entropy is the entropy content of one mole of pure substance at a standard state of pressure and any temperature of interest. These are often (but not necessarily) chosen to be the standard temperature and pressure.

The standard molar entropy at pressure = formula_1 is usually given the symbol , and has units of joules per mole per kelvin (J⋅mol−1⋅K−1). Unlike standard enthalpies of formation, the value of is absolute. That is, an element in its standard state has a definite, nonzero value of at room temperature. The entropy of a pure crystalline structure can be 0J⋅mol−1⋅K−1 only at 0K, according to the third law of thermodynamics. However, this assumes that the material forms a &#x27;perfect crystal&#x27; without any residual entropy. This can be due to crystallographic defects, dislocations, and/or incomplete rotational quenching within the solid, as originally pointed out by Linus Pauling. These contributions to the entropy are always present, because crystals always grow at a finite rate and at temperature. However, the residual entropy is often quite negligible and can be accounted for when it occurs using statistical mechanics. 

==Thermodynamics==
If a mole of a solid substance is a perfectly ordered solid at 0K, then if the solid is warmed by its surroundings to 298.15K without melting, its absolute molar entropy would be the sum of a series of stepwise and reversible entropy changes. The limit of this sum as formula_2 becomes an integral:
:formula_3
In this example, formula_4 and formula_5 is the molar heat capacity at a constant pressure of the substance in the reversible process . The molar heat capacity is not constant during the experiment because it changes depending on the (increasing) temperature of the substance. Therefore, a table of values for formula_6 is required to find the total molar entropy. The quantity
formula_7 represents the ratio of a very small exchange of heat energy to the temperature . The total molar entropy is the sum of many small changes in molar entropy, where each small change can be considered a reversible process.

==Chemistry==
The standard molar entropy of a gas at STP includes contributions from:

* The heat capacity of one mole of the solid from 0K to the melting point (including heat absorbed in any changes between different crystal structures).
* The latent heat of fusion of the solid.
* The heat capacity of the liquid from the melting point to the boiling point.
* The latent heat of vaporization of the liquid.
* The heat capacity of the gas from the boiling point to room temperature.

Changes in entropy are associated with phase transitions and chemical reactions. Chemical equations make use of the standard molar entropy of reactants and products to find the standard entropy of reaction:
:formula_8

The standard entropy of reaction helps determine whether the reaction will take place spontaneously. According to the second law of thermodynamics, a spontaneous reaction always results in an increase in total entropy of the system and its surroundings:
:formula_9
Molar entropy is not the same for all gases. Under identical conditions, it is greater for a heavier gas.
