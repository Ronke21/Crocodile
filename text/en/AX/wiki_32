<text>Public broadcasting (or public service broadcasting) involves radio, television, and other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is public service. Public broadcasters receive funding from diverse sources including license fees, individual contributions, public financing, and commercial financing, and claim to avoid both political interference and commercial influence.

Common media include AM, FM, and shortwave radio; television; and the Internet. Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated, depending on the country and the station. In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting. Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages. Historically, public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries (with the notable exceptions of the United States, Mexico, and Brazil). Commercial broadcasting now also exists in most of these countries; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century.

==Definition==
The primary mission of public broadcasting is that of public service, speaking to and engaging as a citizen. The British model is often referenced in definitions. The model embodies the following principles:

* Universal geographic accessibility
* Universal appeal
* Attention to minorities (&quot;special provision for minorities&quot;)
* Contribution to national identity and sense of community
* Distance from vested interests
* Direct funding and universality of payment
* Encourage competition &quot;in good programming rather than competition for numbers&quot;
* Guidelines that liberate rather than restrict

While the application of certain principles may be straightforward, as in the case of accessibility, some of the principles may be poorly defined or difficult to implement. In the context of a shifting national identity, the role of public broadcasting may be unclear. Likewise, the subjective nature of good programming may raise the question of individual or public taste.

Within public broadcasting there are two different views regarding commercial activity. One is that public broadcasting is incompatible with commercial objectives. The other is that public broadcasting can and should compete in the marketplace with commercial broadcasters. This dichotomy is highlighted by the public service aspects of traditional commercial broadcasters.

Public broadcasters in each jurisdiction may or may not be synonymous with government controlled broadcasters.

==Economics==
Public broadcasters may receive their funding from an obligatory television licence fee, individual contributions, government funding or commercial sources. Public broadcasters do not rely on advertising to the same degree as commercial broadcasters, or at all; this allows public broadcasters to transmit programmes that are not commercially viable to the mass market, such as public affairs shows, radio and television documentaries, and educational programmes.

One of the principles of public broadcasting is to provide coverage of interests for which there are missing or small markets. Public broadcasting attempts to supply topics of social benefit that are otherwise not provided by commercial broadcasters. Typically, such underprovision is argued to exist when the benefits to viewers are relatively high in comparison to the benefits to advertisers from contacting viewers. This frequently is the case in undeveloped countries that normally have low benefits to advertising.

An alternative funding model proposed by Michael Slaby is to give every citizen credits they can use to pay qualified media sources for civic information and reporting.

==Cultural policy==
Additionally, public broadcasting may facilitate the implementation of a cultural policy (an industrial policy and investment policy for culture). Examples include:

*In Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is legally required to &#x27;encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia&#x27; and &#x27;broadcasting programmes that contribute to a sense of national identity&#x27; with specific emphasis on regional and rural Australia&#x27;. Furthermore, the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) is intended to reflect the spirit and sense of multicultural richness and the unique international cultural values within Australian society.

== Public Media Alliance ==
As an industry organization for public media, the Public Media Alliance supports its members and the industry of public media more broadly. For example, the Alliance advocated against a proposal on the Isle of Man that they felt would jeopardize the editorial independence of the broadcaster. While many members have significant editorial independence, the Alliance includes organizations that have significant state control, especially with regard to island nations.

====Brazil====

In Brazil, the two main national public broadcasters are Empresa Brasil de Comunicação (EBC) and the Fundação Padre Anchieta (FPA). EBC was created in 2007 to manage the Brazilian federal government&#x27;s radio and television stations. EBC owns broadcast the television channel TV Brasil (launched in 2007, being the merger of TVE Brasil, launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1975, and TV Nacional, launched in Brasilia in 1960), the radio stations Rádio Nacional and Rádio MEC, broadcast to Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Recife, and Tabatinga, Rádio Nacional da Amazônia, a shortwave radio station based in Brasília with programming aimed to the population of the Amazon region, and Agência Brasil, a news agency. Starting in 2021, EBC expanded the coverage of its radio stations through the new FM extended band to the metropolitan areas of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte and Recife, important Brazilian regions which did not have EBC radio stations.

FPA is a non-profit foundation created by the government of the state of São Paulo in 1967 and includes a national educational public television network (TV Cultura, launched in 1969 in São Paulo, which is available in all Brazilian states through its 135 affiliates), two radio stations (Rádio Cultura FM and Rádio Cultura Brasil, both broadcasting to Greater São Paulo), two educational TV channels aimed at distance education (TV Educação and Univesp TV, which is available on free-to-air digital TV in São Paulo and nationally by cable and satellite), and the children&#x27;s TV channel TV Rá-Tim-Bum, available nationally on pay TV.

Many Brazilian states also have regional and statewide public radio and television stations. One example is Minas Gerais, which has the EMC (&quot;Empresa Mineira de Comunicação&quot;), a public corporation created in 2016 modelled on EBC, formed by Rede Minas, a statewide television network and the two stations of Rádio Inconfidência, which operates in AM, FM and shortwave; in the state of Pará, the state-funded foundation FUNTELPA (&quot;Fundação Paraense de Radiodifusão&quot;) operates the public educational state-wide television network Rede Cultura do Pará (which covers the entire state of Pará, reaching many cities of Brazilian Amazon) and Rádio Cultura, a public radio station which broadcasts in FM for Belém. The state of Espírito Santo has the RTV-ES (&quot;Rádio e Televisão Espírito Santo&quot;), with its television channel TVE-ES (&quot;TV Educativa do Espírito Santo&quot;) and an AM radio station (&quot;Rádio Espírito Santo&quot;), and in Rio Grande do Sul, the state-wide public television channel TVE-RS (&quot;TV Educativa do Rio Grande do Sul&quot;) and the public radio station FM Cultura (which broadcasts for Porto Alegre metropolitan area) are the two public broadcasters in the state. Regional public television channels in Brazil often broadcast part of TV Brasil or TV Cultura programming among with some hours of local programming.

Since the government of Michel Temer, EBC has received several criticism from some politicians for having an alleged political bias. The president of Brazil from 2019 to 2022, Jair Bolsonaro, said in his campaign for the presidential election in 2018 that the public broadcaster is allegedly a &quot;job hanger&quot; (public company existing only for the purpose of securing positions for political allies) and has proposed to privatize or extinguish the public company. On April 9, 2021, the president inserted the public company into the National Privatization Program, with the intention of carrying out studies about the possibility of privatization of the public broadcaster. Some states often had problems with their public broadcasting services. In São Paulo, FPA had sometimes dealt with budget cuts, labor disputes and strikes. In Rio Grande do Sul, TVE-RS and FM Cultura were managed by the Piratini Foundation, a non-profit state foundation. However, due to the public debt crisis in the state, in 2018, the Piratini Foundation had its activities closed, and TVE-RS and FM Cultura started to be managed by the Secretariat of Communication of the state government.

Brazil also has many campus radio and community radio stations and several educational local TV channels (many of them belonging to public and private universities).

====Canada====

In Canada, the main public broadcaster is the national Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC; ), a crown corporation – which originated as a radio network in November 1936. It is the successor to the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC), which was established by the administration of Prime Minister R.B. Bennett in 1932, modeled on recommendations made in 1929 by the Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting and stemming from lobbying efforts by the Canadian Radio League. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation took over operation of the CRBC&#x27;s nine radio stations (which were largely concentrated in major cities across Canada, including Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and Ottawa). The CBC eventually expanded to television in September 1952 with the sign-on of CBFT in Montreal; CBFT was the first television station in Canada to initiate full-time broadcasts, which initially served as a primary affiliate of the French language Télévision de Radio-Canada and a secondary affiliate of the English language CBC Television service.

CBC operates two national television networks (CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé), four radio networks (CBC Radio One, CBC Radio 2, Ici Radio-Canada Première, and Ici Musique) and several cable television channels including two 24-hour news channels (CBC News Network and Ici RDI) in both of Canada&#x27;s official languages – English and French – and the French-language channels Ici Explora and Ici ARTV, dedicated to science and culture respectively. CBC&#x27;s national television operations and some radio operations are funded partly by advertisements, in addition to the subsidy provided by the federal government. The cable channels are commercial entities owned and operated by the CBC and do not receive any direct public funds, however, they do benefit from synergies with resources from the other CBC operations. The CBC has frequently dealt with budget cuts and labour disputes, often resulting in a debate about whether the service has the resources necessary to properly fulfill its mandate.

, all of CBC Television&#x27;s terrestrial stations are owned and operated by the CBC directly. The number of privately owned CBC Television affiliates has gradually declined in recent years, as the network has moved its programming to stations opened by the corporation or has purchased certain affiliates from private broadcasting groups; budgetary issues led the CBC to choose not to launch new rebroadcast transmitters in markets where the network disaffiliated from a private station after 2006; the network dropped its remaining private affiliates in 2016, when CJDC-TV—Dawson Creek and CFTK-TV—Terrace, British Columbia defected from CBC Television that February and Lloydminster-based CKSA-DT disaffiliated in August of that year (to become affiliates of CTV Two and Global, respectively). The CBC&#x27;s decision to disaffiliate from these and other privately owned stations, as well as the corporation decommissioning its network of rebroadcasters following Canada&#x27;s transition to digital television in August 2011 have significantly reduced the terrestrial coverage of both CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé; the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) does require cable, satellite and IPTV providers to carry CBC and Radio-Canada stations as part of their basic tier, regardless of terrestrial availability in an individual market. Of the three major French-language television networks in Canada, Ici Radio-Canada Télé is the only one that maintains terrestrial owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in all ten Canadian provinces, although it maintains only one station (Moncton, New Brunswick-based CBAFT-DT) that serves the four provinces comprising Atlantic Canada.

In recent years, the CBC has also expanded into new media ventures including the online radio service CBC Radio 3, music streaming service CBC Music, and the launch of online news services, such as CBC Hamilton, in some markets which are not directly served by their own CBC television or radio stations.

In addition, several provinces operate public broadcasters; these are not CBC subentities, but distinct networks in their own right. Most of the provincial services maintain an educational programming format, differing from the primarily entertainment-based CBC/Radio-Canada operations, but more closely formatted to (and carrying many of the same programs as) the U.S.-based Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), which itself is available terrestrially and – under a CRTC rule that requires Canadian cable, satellite and IPTV providers to carry affiliates of the four major U.S. commercial networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox) and a PBS member station – through pay television providers in Canada via member stations located near the U.S.–Canada border. These educational public broadcasters include the English-language TVOntario (TVO) and the French-language TFO in Ontario, Télé-Québec in Quebec, and Knowledge Network in British Columbia. TVO and Télé-Québec operate through conventional transmitters and cable, while TFO and Knowledge Network are cable-only channels. Beyond these and other provincial services, Canada does not have a national public educational network.
Canada is also home to a number of former public broadcasting entities that have gone private. CTV Two Alberta, which is licensed as an educational television station in Alberta, was once owned by the Alberta government as the public broadcaster Access. In 1993, the provincial government agreed to cease to direct funding of Access after the 1994 fiscal year; the channel was sold to CHUM Limited in 1995, which initially acquired the channel through a majority-owned subsidiary, Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Limited (LSTA). To fulfill its license conditions as an educational station, it broadcasts educational and children&#x27;s programming during the daytime hours, while airing entertainment programming favoured by advertisers and viewers in prime time. The service discontinued its broadcast transmitters in Calgary and Edmonton in August 2011, due to the expense of transitioning the two stations to digital, and the fact that the service had mandatory carriage on television providers serving Alberta regardless of whether it ran over-the-air transmitters. The service has since operated as part of Bell Media&#x27;s CTV Two chain of stations.

Public radio station CKUA in Alberta was also formerly operated by Access, before being sold to the non-profit CKUA Radio Foundation which continues to operate it as a community-funded radio network. CJRT-FM in Toronto also operated as a public government-owned radio station for many years; while no longer funded by the provincial government, it still solicits most of its budget from listener and corporate donations and is permitted to air only a very small amount of commercial advertising.

City Saskatchewan originated as the Saskatchewan Communications Network, a cable-only educational and cultural public broadcaster owned by the government of Saskatchewan. SCN was sold to Bluepoint Investment Corporation in 2010, and like CTV Two Alberta did when it became privatized, incorporated a limited schedule of entertainment programming during the late afternoon and nighttime hours, while retaining educational and children&#x27;s programs during the morning until mid-afternoon to fulfill its licensing conditions; Bluepoint later sold the channel to Rogers Media in 2012, expanding a relationship it began with SCN in January of that year, when Rogers began supplying entertainment programming to the channel through an affiliation agreement with its English-language broadcast network, Citytv. One television station, CFTU in Montreal, operates as an educational station owned by CANAL (), a private not-for-profit consortium of educational institutions in the province of Quebec.

Some local community stations also operate non-commercially with funding from corporate and individual donors. In addition, cable companies are required to produce a local community channel in each licensed market. Such channels have traditionally aired community talk shows, city council meetings and other locally oriented programming, although it is becoming increasingly common for them to adopt the format and branding of a local news channel.

Canada also has a large number of campus radio and community radio stations.

====Colombia====

Colombia had between 1955 and 1998 a public television system very similar to that adopted by the NPO in the Netherlands, where private television producers called &quot;programadoras&quot; were given hours on the country&#x27;s two public television channels (Cadena Uno and Canal A). In 1998, when the Colombian government allowed the opening of television to the private market by granting two broadcast licenses to the &quot;programadoras&quot; Caracol Televisión and RCN Televisión, these television producers went into crisis, causing many to end their activities or produce content for the private television channels. Currently, Colombia has three public channels (one is operated by a private company formed by the shares of four former &quot;programadoras&quot;) and eight public radio stations (three stations are regional broadcasters).

====Chile====

Chilean television was founded through universities, in an attempt to bring public television without the state having to pay directly and control content. The University of Chile (owner of the former channels 9 and 11 until 1993), the Catholic University of Chile on channels 2 and 13 until 2010, and the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso on channels 8 and 4. Channel 8, in Valparaíso, is the first and oldest station on Chile, transmitting since 5 October 1957. As soon as 1961 universities began transmitting advertisements between their programmes, the first of them being the Channel 9, showing a Motorola TV set. This kind of disguised advertising took the name of &quot;Payola&quot;. This situation, added to the fact that TV was only reaching Santiago and Valparaíso, led to the creation of a state network that should serve the entire country. This network, created in 1964 and in operation since 24 October 1969, is known as &quot;Televisión Nacional de Chile&quot;. After the military government of Augusto Pinochet, television was mostly deregulated. Thus, two new commercial channels were born: Megavisión (Channel 9, on 23 October 1990) and La Red (Channel 4, on 12 May 1991). The University of Chile&#x27;s Channel 11 also was rented to a private operator on 1 October 1993 and is now known today as &quot;Chilevisión&quot;.

Televisión Nacional, popularly known as Channel 7 due to its Santiago frequency, is governed by a seven-member board appointed by both the President and the Senate. It is meant to be independent of political pressures, although accusations of bias have been made, especially during election campaigns.

====Ecuador====
Ecuador TV is the public service channel of Ecuador, established in October 2007. The channel was established at the same time as the installation of the Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly so that the sessions could be transmitted live to all the country.

==== El Salvador ====
Salvadoran broadcasting has a public service radio and television channel. On 1 March 1926 began the operation as the first Central American broadcasting network called &quot;Radio Nacional de El Salvador&quot; with a frequency of 96.9 FM MHz founded by the president of that era, Alfonso Quiñónez Molina. On 4 November 1964 the Government of El Salvador founded Televisión Educativa de El Salvador as an educational television with the channels 8 and 10. And since 1989, Channel 10 became the only public television channel in El Salvador.

==== Mexico ====
In Mexico, public stations are operated by municipalities, state governments and universities, there are five national public channels. Canal Once is owned and operated by the National Politechnical Institute. It started transmissions on 2 March 1959 as the first public broadcasting television in Mexico. The government of Mexico implemented Telesecundaria in 1968 to provide secondary education to students in rural areas through broadcast television channels, such as XHGC-TV in Mexico City. With the launching of the Morelos II satellite, Telesecundaria began transmitting on one of its analog channels in 1988; in 1994, it began broadcasting in digital format with the advent of the Solidaridad I satellite, and Edusat was established and began transmitting in Mexico, Central America and certain regions of the United States. In 1982, Canal 22 was founded and began operations eleven years later by the Ministry of Culture as part of the &quot;RED México&quot;. In 2005 the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM in Spanish) began transmissions as the sister channel of XEUN-AM and XEUN-FM (both radio stations founded in 1959), TV UNAM which is part of the university and cultural diffusion. Canal Catorce was founded in 2012 and is operated by the Sistema Público de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano (SPR), an agency from the Federal Government.

====United States====

In the United States, public broadcasters may receive some funding from both federal and state sources, but generally most of their financial support comes from underwriting by foundations and businesses (ranging from small shops to corporations), along with audience contributions via pledge drives. The great majority operate as private not-for-profit corporations.

=====History=====
Early public stations were operated by state colleges and universities and were often run as part of the schools&#x27; cooperative extension services. Stations in this era were internally funded, and did not rely on listener contributions to operate, some accepted advertising. Networks such as Iowa Public Radio, South Dakota Public Radio, and Wisconsin Public Radio began under this structure. The concept of a &quot;non-commercial, educational&quot; station &quot;per se&quot; did not show up in U.S. law until 1941, when the FM band was authorized to begin normal broadcasting. Houston&#x27;s KUHT was the nation&#x27;s first public television station founded by Dr. John W. Meaney, and signed on the air on May 25, 1953, from the campus of the University of Houston. In rural areas, it was not uncommon for colleges to operate commercial stations instead (e.g., the University of Missouri&#x27;s KOMU, an NBC-affiliated television station in Columbia). The FCC had reserved almost 250 broadcast frequencies for use as educational television stations in 1953, though by 1960, only 44 stations allocated for educational use had begun operations.

The passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 precipitated the development of the current public broadcasting system in the U.S. The legislation established the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a private entity that is charged with facilitating programming diversity among public broadcasters, the development and expansion of non-commercial broadcasting, and providing funding to local stations to help them create programs; the CPB receives funding earmarked by the federal government as well as through public and private donations.

Public television and radio in the U.S. have, from the late 1960s onward, dealt with severe criticism from conservative politicians and think-tanks (such as The Heritage Foundation), which allege that its programming has a leftist bias and there have been successful attempts to reduce – though not eliminate – funding for public television stations by some state legislatures.

=====Radio=====
The first public radio network in the United States was founded in 1949 in Berkeley, California, as station KPFA, which became and remains the flagship station for a national network called Pacifica Radio. From the beginning, the network has refused corporate funding of any kind, and has relied mainly on listener support. KPFA gave away free FM radios to build a listener base and to encourage listeners to &quot;subscribe&quot; (support the station directly with donations). It is the world&#x27;s oldest listener-supported radio network. Since the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Pacifica has sometimes received CPB support. Pacifica runs other stations in Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Houston, as well as repeater stations and a large network of affiliates.

A national public radio network, National Public Radio (NPR), was created in February 1970, following the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. This network replaced the Ford Foundation–backed National Educational Radio Network. Some independent local public radio stations buy their programming from distributors such as NPR; Public Radio International (PRI); American Public Media (APM); Public Radio Exchange (PRX); and Pacifica Radio, most often distributed through the Public Radio Satellite System. Cultural Native American and Mexican American music and programming are also featured regionally. NPR is colloquially though inaccurately conflated with &quot;public radio&quot; as a whole, when in fact &quot;public radio&quot; includes many organizations.

=====Television=====
In the United States, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) serves as the nation&#x27;s main public television provider. When it launched in October 1970, PBS assumed many of the functions of its predecessor, National Educational Television (NET). NET was shut down by the Ford Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after the network refused to stop airing documentaries on varying social issues that had alienated many of the network&#x27;s affiliates. PBS would later acquire Educational Television Stations, an organization founded by the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB), in 1973.

====Uruguay====
Uruguay has a strong history of public broadcasting in South America. Inaugurated in 1963, Televisión Nacional Uruguay (TNU) is now linked to the Ministry of Education and Culture of the country. In addition, the Radiodifusión Nacional de Uruguay is a network of radios with 20 different stations in AM and FM that cover the entire country.

====Venezuela====

Since 1998, the Venezuelan state had only one television channel Venezolana de Televisión, and after 2002 the government decided to launch the channel ViVe (2003), teleSUR (2005), TVES (2007) (a signal that until that year was occupied by RCTV) and Asamblea Nacional Televisión in addition to supporting and financing a network of community channels as well as Ávila Television belonging to the Metropolitan Mayor&#x27;s Office of Caracas. United States politicians have commented that TeleSUR is a propaganda tool in favor of the Bolivarian Revolution.

===Asia===

====Bangladesh====
The Bengali primary state television broadcaster is Bangladesh Television which also broadcasts worldwide through its satellite based branch, BTV World. There are also terrestrial state run TV channels: Sangsad TV owned and operated by Bengali parliament that covers the proceedings of the Parliament.
The Bangladesh Betar (BB) is the country&#x27;s sole state radio broadcaster. Radio transmission in the region now forming Bangladesh started in Dhaka on December 16, 1939. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (Bangladesh) is responsible for the administration of all government TV channels and Radio.

====Brunei Darussalam====
Radio Television Brunei (RTB) is the only public broadcaster in Brunei Darussalam.

====Hong Kong====

In Hong Kong, the Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) is the sole public service broadcaster. Although being a government department under the administrative hierarchy, it enjoys editorial independence. It operates seven radio channels and produces television programmes and broadcast on commercial television channels, as these channels are required by law to provide timeslots for RTHK television programmes. RTHK would be assigned a digital terrestrial television channel during 2013 to 2015.

====India====
In India, Prasar Bharati is India&#x27;s public broadcaster. It is an autonomous corporation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India and comprises the Doordarshan television network (DD National, DD India and DD News) and All India Radio. Prasar Bharati was established on 23 November 1997, following a demand that the government-owned broadcasters in India should be given autonomy like those in many other countries. The Parliament of India passed an Act to grant this autonomy in 1990, but it was not enacted until 15 September 1997. Though a public broadcaster, it airs commercial advertisements.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, there are three types of public broadcaster. The first two are national-scale broadcasters: Radio Republik Indonesia (RRI) and Televisi Republik Indonesia (TVRI). RRI currently operates four radio networks carried by some or all of more than 90 local stations, one of them is a national programming network. TVRI operates three national television channels, plus more than 32 regional stations.

There are also independent local public broadcasters which founded by local government in several cities or regencies. They are obligated to network with either RRI or TVRI, depending on the medium, though they are not owned and operated by the two.

====Japan====
In Japan, the main public broadcaster is the NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation). The broadcaster was set up in 1926 and was modelled on the British Broadcasting Company, the precursor to the British Broadcasting Corporation created in 1927. Much like the BBC, NHK is funded by a &quot;receiving fee&quot; from every Japanese household, with no commercial advertising and the maintenance of a position of strict political impartiality. However, rampant non-payment by a large amount of households has led the receiving fee to become something of a political issue. NHK runs two national terrestrial TV stations (NHK General and NHK Educational) and three satellite only services (NHK BS, NHK BS Premium4K, and NHK BS8K services). NHK also runs 3 national radio services and a number of international radio and television services, akin to the BBC World Service. NHK has also been an innovator in television, developing the world&#x27;s first high-definition television technology in 1964 and launching high definition services in Japan in 1981.

====Malaysia====
The public broadcaster in Malaysia is the state-owned Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) and TV Alhijrah. RTM was previously funded publicly through money obtained from television licensing, however it is currently state-subsidised, as television licences have been abolished.

 RTM operates 6 national, 16 state and 11 district radio stations as well as 6 national terrestrial television channels: TV1, TV2, TV Okey, Sukan RTM, Berita RTM, and TV6.

====Nepal====
History of public broadcasting in Nepal started from 1951.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, the public broadcasters are the state-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), also known as Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television. In the past Radio Pakistan was partly funded through money obtained from License fees. In 1999, the Nawaz Sharif government abolished license fees for Radio Pakistan and also abolished its tax exempt status protected under PBC Act 1973. The license fees for Pakistan Television continued. The license fees collection for PTV was given to WAPDA during Musharraf government. Currently WAPDA collects Rs. 35 per house hold on electricity bills as PTV license fees. Television Broadcasting started in Pakistan with a small pilot TV Station established at Lahore Radio from where transmission was first beamed in black-and-white with effect from 26 November 1964. Television centres were established in Dhaka, Karachi and Rawalpindi/Islamabad in 1967 and in Peshawar and Quetta in 1974. PTV has various channels transmitting throughout the world including PTV National, PTV World, PTV 2, PTV Global, PTV Bolan etc. Radio Pakistan has stations covering all the major cities, it covers 80% of the country serving 95.5 Million listeners. It has world service in eleven languages daily.

====Philippines====

The Philippines&#x27; primary state television broadcaster is People&#x27;s Television Network (PTV). Created in 1974 as Government Television (GTV), PTV is no longer state subsidised except for a one-time equity funding for capital outlay in 1992. Aside from PTV, the other public broadcaster is the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC), which the government has already put up for sale. The government no longer holds a controlling interest in the former state broadcaster, Radio Philippines Network (RPN).

The Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS) is the country&#x27;s sole state radio broadcaster. Established in 1933 as KZFM by the US colonial Insular Government, the radio station was passed to the Philippine government after the country became independent in 1946. Currently, PBS broadcasts its flagship network Radyo Pilipinas (formerly Radyo ng Bayan) through its 32 stations and selected affiliates nationwide.

The government is currently planning to propose the creation of a law that will merge and integrate PTV and PBS into a single entity, to be called the People&#x27;s Broadcasting Corporation (PBC).

====Singapore====
Mediacorp is the only public broadcaster in Singapore.

====South Korea====
South Korea&#x27;s representative public broadcasting television network is meant to be Korean Broadcasting System, or KBS. Originally a government-controlled channel, it is now an independent broadcasting system. KBS began broadcasting radio in 1947 and opened up to television industry in 1961, and officially founded its own identity by 1973. Another public broadcasting channel is the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, or MBC. Known to be the second channel of the country, it also shares the roles of being national television with the KBS.

South Korea also has another public broadcasting channel called Educational Broadcasting System, or EBS. Originally considered to be an extension channel of the KBS, it was spun-off as an educational channel but retained its public broadcasting tasks. KBS and EBS mainly are funded by the commercials that they provide in their channels, but due to growing competitions, this is becoming an issue for them as well.

====Taiwan====
Public Television Service, also called Taiwan Public Television Service Foundation, is the first independent public broadcasting institution in Taiwan, which broadcasts the Public Television Service Taiwan. Since its creation in 1998, PTS has produced several critically acclaimed dramatic programmes and mini-series despite experiencing funding difficulties. PTS is bound up in speaking for the minorities, including the promotion of Hakka Chinese and Formosan-language programming, an effort that has contributed much to the &quot;Taiwanization&quot; movement.

====Thailand====

In Thailand, there are two primary public broadcasters. First is the Thai Public Broadcasting Service (TPBS), it was established by the Thai Public Broadcasting Service Act, BE 2551, which came into force on 15 January 2008. Under this act, TPBS holds the status of state agency with legal personality, but is not a government agency or state enterprise. TPBS operates Thai PBS (ไทยพีบีเอส), which was formerly known as iTV, TITV and TV Thai television station. Thai PBS tested its broadcast by connecting to a temporary signal for broadcasting to the special programs chart which had been appropriated by Television of Thailand (TVT or TV 11 Thailand) at TVT New Phetchaburi Road Broadcasting Station. (presently National News Bureau of Thailand headquarters and NBT World TV Station and formerly UHF Channel 29, from 15 to 31 January 2008. Programs began on 1 February 2008.)

Second is the state-owned state media known as National Broadcasting Services of Thailand (NBT) is the public broadcasting arm of the Government Public Relations Department (PRD), a division of the Thai Government.

Yle&#x27;s Voitto robot based on machine learning is the first personal news assistant in the world to give recommendations directly on the lock screen in the Yle NewsWatch application.

====France====
In 1949 Radiodiffusion-télévision française (RTF – French television and radio broadcasting) was created to take over from the earlier Radiodiffusion française responsibility for the operation of the country&#x27;s three public radio networks and the introduction of a public television service. RFO and a fourth radio network was added in 1954 and a second television channel in 1963.

RTF was transformed into the (ORTF), a more independent structure, in 1964. ORTF oversaw the introduction of a third television channel in 1972, two years before the dissolution of the structure in 1974. At that time a network of local and regional channels was created, nationally grouped under the France 3 channel, and between this date and 2000, each national channel had its own direction structure, while being in France Télévision group. In 1984, the European channel TV5Monde is created. The first channel (TF1) was sold to the private sector in 1987. (At the time, the channel with the largest audience was the other public channel Antenne 2).

In 1986 La Sept, another European channel, was created, before being eaten by the French/German public channel ARTE in 1991, originally broadcast on cable and satellite. In 1992, the fall of the private channel La Cinq freed the frequencies that it had used, witch has been affected to ARTE each day from 19.00 to 3. In 1994 a new public channel, La cinquième was created and used the remaining time on the same frequencies. La cinquième and ARTE subsequently shared the same channels with the exception of satellite, cable, and internet channels where both could be broadcast all day long. As 31 March 2005 broadcast permitted to give plain channel to La cinquième, ARTE, France Ô, and France 4. Moreover, Gulli, a channel dedicated to kids, was partially owned by France Télévision between 2005 and 2014.

====Germany====
After World War II, when regional broadcasters had been merged into one national network by the Nazis to create a powerful means of propaganda, the Allies insisted on a de-centralised, independent structure for German public broadcasting and created regional public broadcasting agencies that, by and large, still exist today.
* NDR (Lower Saxony, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern), split from former NWDR
* RBB (Berlin and Brandenburg), merged from SFB and ORB
* SWR (Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate), merged from SDR and SWF
* MDR (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia), established in 1991
* WDR (North Rhine-Westphalia), split from former NWDR
* BR (Bavaria)
* hr (Hesse)
* SR (Saarland)
* RB (Bremen)

In addition to these nine regional radio and TV broadcasters, which cooperate within ARD, a second national television serviceactually called Second German Television (, ZDF)was later created in 1961 and a national radio service with two networks (Deutschlandradio) emerged from the remains of Cold War propaganda stations in 1994. All services are mainly financed through licence fees paid by every household and are governed by councils of representatives of the &quot;societally relevant groups&quot;. Public TV and radio stations spend about 60% of the ≈10bn € spent altogether for broadcasting in Germany per year, making it the most well funded public broadcasting system in the world.

The &quot;Hans-Bredow-Institut&quot;, or Hans-Bredow-Institute for Media Research at the University of Hamburg (HBI) is an independent non-profit foundation with the mission on media research on public communication, particularly for radio and television broadcasting (including public service media providers) and other electronic media, in an interdisciplinary fashion.

====Ireland====
In Ireland there are two state owned public service broadcasters, RTÉ and TG4. RTÉ was established in 1960 with the merger of (1926) and (1960). TG4 was formed as a subsidiary of RTÉ in 1996 as (TnaG), it was renamed TG4 in 1999, and was made independent of RTÉ in 2007.

Both Irish public service broadcasters receive part of the licence fee, with RTÉ taking the lion&#x27;s share of the funding. Advertising makes up 50% of RTÉ&#x27;s income and just 6% of TG4&#x27;s income. 7% of the licence fee is provided to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland since 2006. Up to 2006 the licence fee was given entirely to RTÉ.

Funding used to be collected through a special yearly TV tax (the so-called &quot;Canone&quot;), but due to the high rates of evasion the government linked its payment to every household&#x27;s electricity bill (90 euros for each household in 2017), as well as from advertising. The main competitors of RAI are Mediaset, the biggest national private broadcaster, divided in twelve channels (two of which are both SD and HD), La7 and La7d, owned by Cairo Editore; other competitors are Sky Italia (with three FTA channels) and Discovery Italia (with seven FTA channels).

====Lithuania====

====Montenegro====
RTCG (Radio Television of Montenegro) is the public broadcaster in Montenegro and maintains editorial independence from its government.

====Netherlands====

The Netherlands uses a rather unusual system of public broadcasting. Public-broadcasting associations are allocated money and time to broadcast their programmes on the publicly owned television and radio channels, collectively known under the NPO name. The time and money is allocated in proportion to their membership numbers. The system is intended to reflect the diversity of all the groups composing the nation and maintains editorial independence from the government.

====Nordic countries====
National public broadcasters in Nordic countries were modeled after the BBC and established a decade later: Radioordningen (now DR) in Denmark, Kringkastingselskapet (now NRK) in Norway, and Radiotjänst (now Sveriges Radio and Sveriges Television) in Sweden (all in 1925). In 1926 Yleisradio, (Swedish: Rundradion) now Yle was founded in Finland. Ríkisútvarpið (RÚV) is the official public broadcast service in Iceland. All five are funded from television licence fees costing (in 2007) around () per household per year.

====Poland====
Polskie Radio was seen to be the last remaining form of public broadcasting as Telewizja Polska (TVP) has been seen as state media during the PiS government by various press freedom organisations due its strong bias in favour of the ruling party, with Reporters Without Borders calling it a government mouthpiece.

Polskie Radio operates four nationwide radio channels (which are also available via the broadcaster&#x27;s website). There are also 17 public radio stations broadcasting in particular regions. Polish Radio (and TVP) are funded from several sources: state funding, advertising, obligatory tax on all TV and radio receivers, and money from authors/copyright associations. The public broadcaster offers a mix of commercial shows and programmes they are, by law, required to broadcast (i.e., non-commercial, niche programmes; programmes for children; programmes promoting different points of view and diversity; programmes for different religious and national groups; live coverage of the parliament&#x27;s session on its dedicated channel: TVP Parlament; etc.). It has to be politically neutral, although in the past there have been cases of political pressure on TVP and Polskie Radio from the governing party. Recently, a new law has been passed by the ruling Law &amp; Justice party, that in public perception allowed the party to take a much larger control over the media that has been possible before. The party states this law to be the first step to a complete public media overdo. Many worry no such improvements are actually coming and that these recent laws are only another step in taking control over the whole country by the Law &amp; Justice party.

There is an ongoing debate in Poland about the semi-commercial nature of TVP and PR. Many people fear that making them into totally non-commercial broadcasters would result in the licence fee payable by households being increased, and fewer people being interested in programmes they offer; others say that TVP in particular is too profit-driven and should concentrate on programming that benefits the society.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, the national public broadcaster is Rádio e Televisão de Portugal (RTP), which in 1957 began regular broadcasts of its first channel, now RTP1 and maintains editorial independence from its government. In 1968 its second channel appeared, then called &quot;segundo programa&quot;, now RTP2. In the 1970s, TV arrived in the Portuguese islands of Madeira and the Azores, with the creation of two regional channels: RTP Madeira in 1972 and RTP Açores in 1976.

Until the 1990s the state had a monopoly on TV broadcasting, so RTP1 and RTP2 were the only Portuguese channels, both with similar generalist programmes. In 1990, RTP1 was renamed &quot;Canal 1&quot;, and in 1992 RTP2 was renamed &quot;TV2&quot;. With the creation of the two private channels, SIC in 1992 and Televisão Independente in 1993, the philosophy of the public service changed: in 1995, &quot;TV2&quot; was again renamed RTP2 and became an alternative channel dedicated to culture, science, arts, documentaries, sports (except football), minorities and children. Since then, RTP2 has carried no advertising. Canal 1, renamed back RTP1 also in 1995, remained the commercial channel of RTP group, focused on entertainment, information and major sport competitions. In 2004, after a great restructuring period, RTP started its current branding. That year the two thematic channels of the group were also createdRTPN, a 24 hour-news channel which became RTP Informação in 2011 and RTP3 in 2015; and RTP Memória, dedicated to classic RTP programming. In 2014 the headquarters of RTP2 were transferred from Lisbon to Porto.

The group also has two international channels: RTP Internacional, founded in 1992 and dedicated to Eurovision, Asia and Americas, and RTP África, founded in 1998 focused on Africa, mainly the CPLP countries of Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and São Tomé and Príncipe.

The RTP group is financed by the advertising revenues from RTP1, RTP3, RTP Memória, RTP África, and RTP Internacional, and also by the &quot;taxa de contribuição audiovisual&quot; (broadcasting contribution tax), which is incorporated in electricity bills. Funding from the government budget ceased in 2014, during the Portuguese financial crisis.

====Romania====
Romanian Television (TVR) is the national public TV broadcaster in Romania. It operates five channels: TVR1, TVR2, TVR3, TVRi, and TVR HD, along with six regional studios in Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Iași, Timișoara, Craiova, and Târgu Mureș. It does not have independence from its government.

====Serbia====
Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) is the national public broadcaster in Serbia that does not have editorial independence from its government. It operates a total of five television channels (RTS1, RTS2, RTS Digital, RTS HD and RTS SAT) and five radio stations (Radio Belgrade 1, Radio Belgrade 2, Radio Belgrade 3, Radio Belgrade 202, and Stereorama).

RTVS is funded through monthly fee of €4.64, which every household with electricity connection must pay. The director of RTVS is Václav Mika. RTVS is a full member of European broadcasting union.

====Spain====
In Spain, being a highly decentralized country, two public broadcasting systems coexist: a national state-owned broadcasting corporation, Radiotelevisión Española (RTVE), that does not have editorial independence from the state, and many autonomic broadcasting corporations, owned by their respective autonomous community, which only broadcast within its own territory and many of which do have editorial independence.

RTVE provides multi-station radio and television services with its divisions Radio Nacional de España (RNE) and (TVE), as well as online and streaming services. RNE was founded in 1937 and broadcasts five radio stations: Radio Nacional since 1937, Radio Clásica since 1965, Radio 3 since 1979, Ràdio 4 since 1976, Radio 5 since 1989 and its international worldwide service Radio Exterior since 1942. TVE was founded in 1956 and broadcasts different television channels: (&quot;La Primera&quot; or &quot;La uno&quot;) since 1956, that is a generalist channel; La 2 (&quot;La dos&quot;) since 1966, that offers cultural programming; Teledeporte sports channel since 1994; 24 Horas news channel since 1997; Clan children&#x27;s channel since 2005; and its international worldwide service TVE Internacional since 1989. RTVE Play is its over-the-top media service, and replaced in 2021 its previous online video on demand service created in 2008. Although almost all the programming is the same for all of Spain, RTVE has territorial centers in every autonomous community and produces and broadcasts some local programming in regional variations in each of them. For most of its history, RNE and TVE were funded both from public sources and private advertising; however, from September 2009, RTVE have been funded by a mixture of public tax revenue and funds collected from Spain&#x27;s private television stations, thus removing advertising from its channels. A TV licence fee has been suggested, but with little popular success.

Moreover, most autonomous communities have their own public broadcaster, almost all of these are members of FORTA, and they usually tend to reproduce the model set up by RTVE. In the Autonomous Communities that have their own official language besides (Castilian) Spanish, those channels may broadcast in that co-official language. For example, this occurs in Catalonia, where CCMA&#x27;s Catalunya Ràdio stations and Televisió de Catalunya channels broadcast in Catalan. In the Valencian Community, CVMC has a radio station and a television channel, both branded as À Punt and broadcast mainly in Valencian. In the Basque Country, EITB&#x27;s Eusko Irratia stations and Euskal Telebista (ETB) channels broadcast in either Basque or Spanish. In Galicia, CRTVG&#x27;s Radio Galega stations and Televisión de Galicia (TVG) channels broadcast in Galician. All the autonomous community networks are funded by a mixture of public subsidies and private advertising.

====Sweden====
Sweden has three public service broadcasters, namely Sveriges Television (SVT), Sveriges Utbildningsradio (UR), and Sveriges Radio (SR), having previously had government monopoly. SVT is the national public television broadcaster with 4 channels (SVT 1, SVT 2, SVT BarnKanalen, and SVT 24). The aim is to make programmes for everybody. For example, Sweden has the historic Sami minority and SVT make programmes in their language for them to watch. There are also a Finnish minority in Sweden, thus SVT show news in Finnish on SVT Uutiset. SR is the radio equivalent of SVT, with channels P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and the Finnish channel SR Sisuradio.

====Ukraine====
Public Broadcasting Company of Ukraine (Suspilne) is the national public broadcaster in Ukraine. It operates two national TV channels: Pershyi and Suspilne Kultura, along with 24 regional channels. Suspilne broadcasts on 3 national and 1 international radio channels: Ukrainian Radio, Radio Promin, Radio Kultura and Radio Ukraine International. The regional branches have their broadcasting slots in the broadcast schedule of the Ukrainian Radio.

====United Kingdom====

The United Kingdom has a strong tradition of public service broadcasting. In addition to the BBC, established in 1922, there is also Channel 4, a publicly owned, commercially funded public service broadcaster, and S4C, a Welsh-language broadcaster in Wales. Furthermore, the two commercial broadcasters ITV and Channel 5 also have significant public service obligations imposed as part of their licence to broadcast.

In the UK there are also small community broadcasters. There are now 228 stations with FM broadcast licences (licensed by Ofcom). Community radio stations typically cover a small geographical area with a coverage radius of up to and run on a nonprofit basis. They can cater for whole communities or for different areas of interestsuch as a particular ethnic group, age group or interest group. Community radio stations reflect a diverse mix of cultures and interests. There are stations catering to urban or experimental music, while others are aimed at younger people, religious communities or the armed forces and their families.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In Australia, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) is owned by the Australian Government and is 100% taxpayer funded. The multicultural Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), another public broadcaster, now accepts limited sponsorship and advertising.

In addition, there is a large Australian community radio sector, funded in part by federal grants via the Community Broadcasting Foundation, but largely sustained via subscriptions, donations and business sponsorship. As of February 2020, there are 450+ fully licensed community radio stations and a number of community television stations (most operating as Channel 31 despite being unrelated across different states). They are organised similarly to PBS and NPR stations in the United States, and take on the role that public access television stations have in the US.

====New Zealand====

In New Zealand all broadcasters are given a small slice of public broadcasting responsibility, because of the state-funded agency NZ On Air. This is because of NZ On Air&#x27;s requirement for public-service programmes across all channels and stations, instead of being put into one single network. The former public broadcaster BCNZ (formerly NZBC – New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation) was broken up into separate state-owned corporations, Television New Zealand (TVNZ) and Radio New Zealand (RNZ). While RNZ remains commercial-free, TVNZ is commercially funded through advertising. TVNZ continues to be a public broadcaster; however like CBC Television in Canada it is essentially a fully commercial network in continuous ratings battles with other stations, which continues to be a controversial issue within New Zealand. With the shutdown of TVNZ 7, the only fully non-commercial public-service network in New Zealand is Radio New Zealand.

Aside from television, New Zealand has a rich public radio culture, Radio New Zealand being the main provider, with a varied network (Radio New Zealand National) and a classical musical network (Radio New Zealand Concert). RNZ also provides the Pacific with its Radio New Zealand International. Aside from RNZ almost all of New Zealand&#x27;s 16 regions has an &quot;access radio&quot; network. All these networks are commercial-free.

In late January 2020, the Labour-led coalition government announced that they were planning to merge TVNZ and Radio New Zealand to create a new public broadcasting service. In response, the opposition National Party announced that it would oppose any plans to merge Radio NZ and TVNZ.

<doc id="178810" wikidata="Q59169" url="?curid=178810" title="Mo i Rana">
<text>(Norwegian; ) or (and unofficially , ) is a city, and the administrative centre of Rana Municipality in Nordland county, Norway. It is located in the Helgeland region of Nordland, just south of the Arctic Circle. Some of the city&#x27;s suburbs include Båsmoen and Ytteren in the north, Gruben in the south east, Selfors in the east, and Åga/Hauknes/Dalsgrenda in the south.

The name &quot;Mo i Rana&quot; () is used to distinguish it from other places named Mo (including the town of Mosjøen, also located in Helgeland). The city&#x27;s postal address was &quot;Mo 8600&quot; until 1999, when it was changed to &quot;Mo i Rana 8600&quot;. Today, the postal address is &quot;8622 Mo i Rana&quot;.

The city has a population (2023) of 18,755 and a population density of . This makes it the largest urban area in all of Helgeland, and the second largest city (after Bodø) in Nordland county.

==Name==
Directly translated, the name &quot;Mo i Rana&quot; means &quot;Mo in Rana&quot;. The town (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Mo&quot; farm () since the first Mo Church was built there and this is the site of the modern town of Mo. The name is derived from the word which is the plural form of which means &quot;moorland&quot;. The last element is the name of the large Rana Municipality () which means &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;fast&quot;, likely referring to the fast water flow in the Ranfjorden which flows past the town. Originally the village (and later the growing town) was generally known simply as &quot;Mo&quot;, but since many Norwegian settlements bear that name, disambiguating it by specifying it as the one that is located in Rana became commonplace. As the town grew and became more well-known nationwide, the longer form came to dominate. Locals may still refer to it simply as &quot;Mo&quot;. Also, the short name &quot;Mo&quot; may also be used as shorthand in contexts in which it is already established that one is referring to Mo i Rana.

==Education==
In Mo i Rana, Nord University is located at Campus Helgeland just a short distance from shops, cafes and bars, cinema, theater, training facilities, and transport services including an airport. The campus hosts around 470 students from Nord University and 330 students from partner institutions. Campus Helgeland was opened in 2013 and is one of Norway&#x27;s newest campuses.

&quot;Studentorganisasjonen Helgeland&quot; (SOH) is the student association at Nord University, Campus Helgeland. The organization was formed on 14 April 2013, and was previously known as &quot;Rana Studentforening&quot;, but this was changed when the organization became part of the regional mother-organization &quot;Studentorganisasjonen Nord&quot; in 2020.

==History==

Mining, building boats (Nordlands boats), and hunting/fishing used to be the main ways of life in Rana. Starting in the summer of 1730, there was a Sámi market in Mo. The market was held on the main church grounds until 1810. In 1860, wholesale merchant L.A. Meyer started a trade center, licensed by royal authority. Meyer traded flour, herring and tobacco, reindeer meat, skins and venison with the Swedes. The trade with Sweden increased especially during Sweden&#x27;s difficult economic years from 1892 to the start of the First World War. Many paths now used as hiking trails were originally trade paths for mountain dwellers from Sweden to Mo i Rana. One example is a path that starts in the Vindelfjällens Nature Reserve at Ammarnäs and follows the Vindel River valley, then joins Vindelkroken and eventually crosses the Norwegian border to Mo i Rana.

The municipality is rich on iron ores and water to produce power. This was very important for industrial development. The Dunderland Iron Ore Company (1902–1947), owned by Thomas Edison, established the first mines in Storforshei ( north of Mo i Rana). The mining company Rana Gruber was also established in 1937, and in 1946, the Norwegian Parliament approved plans for the construction of an Iron mill in Norway. A/S Norwegian Iron Work Company was established.

In 1955, the first steel was produced for Norway and other countries. The construction of the iron works took nine years.

During this period the village of Mo i Rana became an industrial city. People from all over Norway moved to Mo i Rana for work. The community needed homes for thousands of new residents and, the construction of houses and residential blocks started immediately. Infrastructure such as electricity and water were established for the city. In 1930, the population was only 1300 people, but had increased to 7,000 by 1955. In 1978 The Iron Mill employed approximately 4,500 of the municipality&#x27;s 25,000 inhabitants.

The Norwegian Parliament resolved in June 1988 to phase out state ownership of the company. Today there are 119 industrial companies located at the industrial estate (Mo Industrial Park). The companies mainly support the iron and steel industry, the engineering industry, the research and development service industry and the information technology industry. In total, the companies employ approximately 1900 people.

From the end of the Second World War until the early 1990s, Mo i Rana, with the town&#x27;s steel mill as its cornerstone, was dependent upon heavy industry. Following the decline of heavy industry, new service industries have now grown in the town.

===&quot;Graveyard War&quot; in 1951===
During the autumn of 1951, around &quot;700 or 800&quot; protesters showed up at the local graveyard as a result of a &quot;night-time mobilisation&quot; to oppose the government&#x27;s attempt to remove Soviet corpses from graves. Some 93,000 Soviet prisoners-of-war had been brought to Norway between 1941 and 1945 by the Germans to work on improvements to infrastructure in Norway. A 2013 article in &quot;Dagbladet&quot; noted that &quot;the protests were so powerful that [then minister of defence] Jens Chr. Hauge personally stopped the [government&#x27;s] action&quot;.

It was only in this locality the government&#x27;s Operation Asphalt stopped by civilians. More than 8000 Soviet corpses were removed from other graveyards in Northern Norway although the government had not decided the location of a new graveyard for these corpses. The protests in Mo i Rana were not mentioned in national media during the Cold War.

===Municipal self-governance (1923–1964)===
Ranen Municipality was established on 1 January 1838, under the old formannskapsdistrikt law. Shortly afterwards, in 1839, the municipality was divided into &quot;Nord-Ranen Municipality&quot; (in the north) and &quot;Sør-Ranen Municipality&quot; (in the south). In 1844, &quot;Nord-Ranen Municipality&quot; was renamed &quot;Mo Municipality&quot; (). On 1 January 1923, the village of Mo was designated as a ladested and so it was separated from the rest of the municipality to become a town-municipality of its own. The new town of Mo (population: 1,305) kept the name &quot;Mo&quot; and the rest of the old municipality became known as Nord-Rana Municipality (bringing back the old name for the area).

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Nord-Rana Municipality (population: 11,636) was merged with the town of &quot;Mo i Rana&quot; (population: 9,616), the part of Sør-Rana Municipality located north of the Ranfjorden (population: 697), and the Sjona area of Nesna Municipality (population: 543) to create the large, new Rana Municipality.

Mo was a self-governing municipality from 1923 until 1964. During that time, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elected a mayor.

==Industry==
Mo Industrial Park is one of Norway&#x27;s largest industrial parks. It is important for the local society, giving work to approximately 1900 people. As of 2023, FREYR has a so-called test factory for battery technology; the size of the factory is 13,000 square meters. The company said that it will be minimizing investments in 2024.

The National Library of Norway has a division in Mo i Rana. HelgelandsKraft supplies electric power to the Helgeland region. NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) has a division in Mo i Rana. Rana Blad and Rana No Are the towns local newspapers. Radio 3 Rana is the local radio station.

Norsk Jernverk, established in 1946, produced steel for the country until 1988, when it was divided into several new companies. The iron mill had a significant impact on the town development. 

In 1978, the city&#x27;s population had grown from approximately 2000 to 25,000.

It was built in 1965 to serve the growing town. In 1977, Ytteren Church was also built.

== Geography ==

Mo i Rana is located at the head of Ranfjorden, just on the southern side of the Saltfjellet mountains with the Svartisen glacier, Norway&#x27;s second largest. The river Ranelva meets the Ranfjorden in Mo i Rana. Rana and Saltfjellet are famous for their numerous caves. Two of the caves are open to the public, Grønligrotta and Setergrotta. Mo i Rana is situated about south of the Arctic Circle.

== Climate ==
Mo i Rana&#x27;s climate is usually classified as subarctic (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot; bordering on &quot;Dsc&quot;), with long, cold winters, and short, warm summers. Mo I Rana is situated about from the coast line, giving it colder winters than towns at the coast. There is much precipitation due to the mountains north and east of town, often with much snow in winter. Blizzards in winter can go on for hours, potentially creating traffic difficulties and cancelling flights. Because of Mo i Rana&#x27;s latitude, summer days are very long and winter days are very short on daylight. In the winter season, the Northern Lights can be seen on the night sky. It varies in intensity, coloured from white green to deep red, and comes in different shapes, such as beams, arches and draperies.

July and August are the warmest months; July mean is and average daily high (1991–2020). There are usually two to three warm periods during the summer, when the average temperature is between at daytime. The warm days may last for 2–14 days, with the temperature peaking at . On rare occasions, the overnight low does not go below , known in Norway as tropical night (&quot;tropenatt&quot; Norwegian).

Autumn begins in September. The trees lose their leaves in October, and the flowers disappear. During November, fresh water and rivers start to freeze, and the landscape is covered with snow. Only the spruce forest stays green throughout the winter. In the winter, the sun is low on the horizon, and is only visible for a few hours. Heating through sunlight is limited because of Mo i Rana&#x27;s high-latitude location. Mountains block the sunlight when the sun is low on the horizon, which means that the sun is not visible at all during the month of December. There are normally two to three very cold periods in the winter with temperature dipping close to . The cold periods normally last 3–7 days. The wettest period is autumn and winter, while spring and summer is the driest. The airport is situated in a valley 8 km away from the fjord, so the airport has colder lows than the town itself. The all-time high temperature is recorded 27 July 2019 (beating from July 2018); the all-time low at the airport is recorded 7 January 2010 (record low for Dec from 2010).

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Mo i Rana is twinned with:
* Fairbanks, Alaska, United States
* Skellefteå, Västerbotten, Sweden
* Aars, North Jutland, Denmark
Mo i Rana was formerly twinned with the Russian city of Petrozavodsk, but the city council terminated its ties to the city after learning that the mayor of Petrozavodsk joined the Akhmat battalions and participated in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Map of the farms of Mo ===

Coordinates are approximate. &lt;br&gt;
Note that each map has a maximum number of listings it can display, so the map has been divided into parts consistent with the enumeration districts (tellingskrets) in the 1920 census. This map will include one farm name per farm number; other farm names or subdivision numbers may exist. 
Tellingskrets (enumeration districts): 1, Dalsgrenn (lime); 2, Sjånes - Andfiskvatne (red); 3, Mo (blue); 4, Gruben - Umbugtenø (green); 5, Villen - Fiskkjønli (black); 6, Plurdalen (purple).

=== Farm names and numbers ===
Following are the farms in the Mo municipality, as they are listed in O. Rygh&#x27;s series Norske_Gaardnavne (&quot;Norwegian farm names&quot;), the Nordland volume of which was published in 1905.
Here is the digital version of that volume:
&lt;Norske_gaardnavne_bd_Nordlands&gt;

The farm numbers are used in some census records, and numbers that are near each other indicate that those farms are geographically proximate. Handwritten Norwegian sources, particularly those prior to 1800, may use variants on these names. For recorded variants before 1723, see the digital version of O. Rygh. Note that the 1920 census records mapped above may not match O. Rygh.

Farm names were often used as part of Norwegian names, in addition to the person&#x27;s given name and patronymic or inherited surname. Some families retained the farm name, or toponymic, as a surname when they emigrated, so in those cases tracing a surname may tell you specifically where in Norway the family was from. This tradition began to change in the mid to late 19th century, and inherited surnames were codified into law in 1923.

<doc id="178816" wikidata="Q61750" url="?curid=178816" title="Tiwanaku">
<text>Tiwanaku ( or ) is a Pre-Columbian archaeological site in western Bolivia, near Lake Titicaca, about 70 kilometers from La Paz, and it is one of the largest sites in South America. Surface remains currently cover around 4 square kilometers and include decorated ceramics, monumental structures, and megalithic blocks. It has been conservatively estimated that the site was inhabited by 10,000 to 20,000 people in AD 800.

The site was first recorded in written history in 1549 by Spanish conquistador Pedro Cieza de León while searching for the southern Inca capital of Qullasuyu.

Jesuit chronicler of Peru Bernabé Cobo reported that Tiwanaku&#x27;s name once was &quot;taypiqala&quot;, which is Aymara meaning &quot;stone in the center&quot;, alluding to the belief that it lay at the center of the world. The name by which Tiwanaku was known to its inhabitants may have been lost as they had no written language. Heggarty and Beresford-Jones suggest that the Puquina language is most likely to have been the language of Tiwanaku.

== Site history ==
The dating of the site has been significantly refined over the last century. From 1910 to 1945, Arthur Posnansky maintained that the site was 11,000–17,000 years old based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy. Beginning in the 1970s, Carlos Ponce Sanginés proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 BC, the site&#x27;s oldest radiocarbon date. This date is still seen in some publications and museums in Bolivia. Since the 1980s, researchers have recognized this date as unreliable, leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 BC. More recently, a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around AD 110 (50–170, 68% probability), a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods.

Tiwanaku began its steady growth in the early centuries of the first millennium AD. From approximately 375 to 700 AD, this Andean city grew to significance. At its height, the city of Tiwanaku spanned an area of roughly 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) and had a population greater than 10,000 individuals. The growth of the city was due to its complex agropastoral economy, supported by trade.

The site appeared to have collapsed around 1000 AD, however the reasoning behind this is still open to debate. Recent studies by geologist Elliott Arnold of the University of Pittsburgh have shown evidence of a greater amount of aridity in the region around the time of collapse. A drought in the region would have affected local systems of agriculture and likely played a role in the collapse of Tiwanaku.

== Relationships ==
The people of Tiwanaku held a tight relationship with the Wari culture. The Wari and Tiwanaku civilizations shared the same iconography, referred to as the &quot;Southern Andean Iconographic Series&quot;. The relationship between the two civilizations is presumed to be trade based or military based. The Wari aren&#x27;t the only other civilization that Tiwanaku could have had contact with. Inca cities also contained similar types of architecture Infrastructure seen in Tiwanaku. From this it can be expected that the Inca took some inspiration from the city of Tiwanaku and other early civilizations in the Andean basin.

== Structures ==

The structures that have been excavated by researchers at Tiwanaku include the terraced platform mound Akapana, Akapana East, and Pumapunku stepped platforms, the Kalasasaya, the Kantatallita, the Kheri Kala, and Putuni enclosures, and the Semi-Subterranean Temple.

The Akapana is a &quot;half Andean Cross&quot;-shaped structure that is 257 m wide, 197 m broad at its maximum, and 16.5 m tall. At its center appears to have been a sunken court. This was nearly destroyed by a deep looters excavation that extends from the center of this structure to its eastern side. Material from the looter&#x27;s excavation was dumped off the eastern side of the Akapana. A staircase is present on its western side. Possible residential complexes might have occupied both the northeast and southeast corners of this structure.

Originally, the Akapana was thought to have been developed from a modified hill. Twenty-first-century studies have shown that it is an entirely man-made earthen mound, faced with a mixture of large and small stone blocks. The dirt comprising Akapana appears to have been excavated from the &quot;moat&quot; that surrounds the site. The largest stone block within the Akapana, made of andesite, is estimated to weigh 65.7 tons. Tenon stone blocks in the form of puma and human heads stud the upper terraces.

The Akapana East was built on the eastern side of early Tiwanaku. Later it was considered a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area. It was made of a thick, prepared floor of sand and clay, which supported a group of buildings. Yellow and red clay was used in different areas for what seems like aesthetic purposes. It was swept clean of all domestic refuse, signaling its great importance to the culture.

The Pumapunku is a man-made platform built on an east-west axis like the Akapana. It is a T-shaped, terraced earthen platform mound faced with megalithic blocks. It is 167.36 m wide along its north-south axis and 116.7 m broad along its east-west axis and is 5 m tall. Identical 20-meter-wide projections extend 27.6 meters north and south from the northeast and southeast corners of the Pumapunku. Walled and unwalled courts and an esplanade are associated with this structure.

A prominent feature of the Pumapunku is a large stone terrace; it is 6.75 by 38.72 meters in dimension and paved with large stone blocks. It is called the &quot;Plataforma Lítica&quot; and contains the largest stone block found in the Tiwanaku site. According to Ponce Sangines, the block is estimated to weigh 131 metric tonnes. The second-largest stone block found within the Pumapunku is estimated to be 85 metric tonnes.

Scattered around the site of the Puma Punku are various types of cut stones. Due to the complexity of the stonework the site is often cited by conspiracy theorists to be a site of ancient alien intervention. These claims are entirely unsubstantiated.
The Kalasasaya is a large courtyard more than 300 feet long, outlined by a high gateway. It is located to the north of the Akapana and west of the Semi-Subterranean Temple. Within the courtyard is where explorers found the Gateway of the Sun. Since the late 20th century, researchers have theorized that this was not the gateway&#x27;s original location.

Near the courtyard is the Semi-Subterranean Temple; a square sunken courtyard that is unique for its north-south rather than east-west axis. The walls are covered with tenon heads of many different styles, suggesting that the structure was reused for different purposes over time. It was built with walls of sandstone pillars and smaller blocks of Ashlar masonry. The largest stone block in the Kalasasaya is estimated to weigh 26.95 metric tons.

Within many of the site&#x27;s structures are impressive gateways; the ones of monumental scale are placed on artificial mounds, platforms, or sunken courts. One gateway shows the iconography of a front-facing figure in Staff God pose. This iconography also is used on some oversized vessels, indicating an importance to the culture. The iconography of the Gateway of the Sun called &quot;Southern Andean Iconographic Series&quot; can be seen on several stone sculptures, Qirus, snuff trays and other Tiwanaku artifacts.

The unique carvings on the top of the Gate of the sun depict animals and other beings. Some have claimed that the symbolism represents a calendar system unique to the people of Tiwanaku, although there is no definitive evidence that this theory is correct. 

The Gateway of the Sun and others located at Pumapunku are not complete. They are missing part of a typical recessed frame known as a chambranle, which typically have sockets for clamps to support later additions. These architectural examples, as well as the Akapana Gate, have unique detail and demonstrate high skill in stone-cutting. This reveals a knowledge of descriptive geometry. The regularity of elements suggests they are part of a system of proportions.

Many theories for the skill of Tiwanaku&#x27;s architectural construction have been proposed. One is that they used a &quot;luk’ a,&quot; which is a standard measurement of about sixty centimeters. Another argument is for the Pythagorean Ratio. This idea calls for right triangles at a ratio of five to four to three used in the gateways to measure all parts. Lastly, Protzen and Nair argue that Tiwanaku had a system set for individual elements dependent on context and composition. This is shown in the construction of similar gateways ranging from diminutive to monumental size, proving that scaling factors did not affect proportion. With each added element, the individual pieces were shifted to fit together.

As the population grew, occupational niches developed, and people began to specialize in certain skills. There was an increase in artisans, who worked in pottery, jewelry, and textiles. Like the later Inca, the Tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions. Instead, the culture relied on elite redistribution. That is, the elites of the state controlled essentially all economic output but were expected to provide each commoner with all the resources needed to perform his or her function. Selected occupations include agriculturists, herders, pastoralists, etc. Such separation of occupations was accompanied by hierarchical stratification within the state.

Some authors believe that the elites of Tiwanaku lived inside four walls that were surrounded by a moat. This theory is called &quot;Tiwanaku moat theory&quot;. This moat, some believe, was to create the image of a sacred island. Inside the walls were many images devoted to human origin, which only the elites would see. Commoners may have entered this structure only for ceremonial purposes since it was home to the holiest of shrines.
=== Cosmology ===

In many Andean cultures, mountains are venerated and may be considered sacred objects. The site of Tiwanaku is located in the valley between two sacred mountains, Pukara and Chuqi Q’awa. At such temples in ancient times, ceremonies were conducted to honor and pay gratitude to the gods and spirits. They were places of worship and rituals that helped unify Andean peoples through shared symbols and pilgrimage destinations.

Tiwanaku became a center of pre-Columbian religious ceremonies for both the general public and elites. For example, human sacrifice was used in several pre-Columbian civilizations to appease a god in exchange for good fortune. Excavations of the Akapana at Tiwanaku revealed the remains of sacrificial dedications of humans and camelids. Researchers speculate that the Akapana may also have been used as an astronomical observatory. It was constructed so that it was aligned with the peak of Quimsachata, providing a view of the rotation of the Milky Way from the southern pole. Other structures like Kalasasaya are positioned to provide optimal views of the sunrise on the Equinox, Summer Solstice, and Winter Solstice. Although the symbolic and functional value of these monuments can only be speculated upon, the Tiwanaku were able to study and interpret the positions of the sun, moon, Milky Way and other celestial bodies well enough to give them a significant role in their architecture.

Aymara legends place Tiwanaku at the center of the universe, probably because of the importance of its geographical location. The Tiwanaku were highly aware of their natural surroundings and would use them and their understanding of astronomy as reference points in their architectural plans. The most significant landmarks in Tiwanaku are the mountains and Lake Titicaca. The lake level of Lake Titicaca has fluctuated significantly over time. The spiritual importance and location of the lake contributed to the religious significance of Tiwanaku. In the Tiwanaku worldview, Lake Titicaca is the spiritual birthplace of their cosmic beliefs. According to Incan mythology, Lake Titicaca is the birthplace of Viracocha, who was responsible for creating the sun, moon, people, and the cosmos. In the Kalasasaya at Tiwanaku, carved atop a monolith known as the Gate of the Sun, is a front-facing figure holding a spear-thrower and snuff. Some speculate that this is a representation of Viracocha. However, it is also possible that this figure represents a deity that the Aymara refer to as “Tunuupa” who, like Viracocha, is associated with legends of creation and destruction.

The Aymara, who are thought to be descendants of the Tiwanaku, have a complex belief system similar to the cosmology of several other Andean civilizations. They believe in the existence of three spaces: Arajpacha, the upper world; Akapacha, the middle or inner world; and Manqhaoacha, the lower world. Often associated with the cosmos and Milky Way, the upper world is considered to be where celestial beings live. The middle world is where all living things are, and the lower world is where life itself is inverted.

=== Archaeology ===
As the site has suffered from looting and amateur excavations since shortly after Tiwanaku&#x27;s fall, archeologists must attempt to interpret it with the understanding that materials have been jumbled and destroyed. This destruction continued during the Spanish conquest and colonial period, and during 19th century and the early 20th century. Other damage was committed by people quarrying stone for building and railroad construction, and target practice by military personnel.

No standing buildings have survived at the modern site. Only public, non-domestic foundations remain, with poorly reconstructed walls. The ashlar blocks used in many of these structures were mass-produced in similar styles so that they could possibly be used for multiple purposes. Throughout the period of the site, certain buildings changed purposes, causing a mix of artifacts found today.

Detailed study of Tiwanaku began on a small scale in the mid-nineteenth century. In the 1860s, Ephraim George Squier visited the ruins and later published maps and sketches completed during his visit. German geologist Alphons Stübel spent nine days in Tiwanaku in 1876, creating a map of the site based on careful measurements. He also made sketches and created paper impressions of carvings and other architectural features. A book containing major photographic documentation was published in 1892 by engineer Georg von Grumbkow, With commentary by archaeologist Max Uhle, this was the first in-depth scientific account of the ruins.

Von Grumbkow had first visited Tiwanaku between the end of 1876 and the beginning of 1877, when he accompanied as a photographer the expedition of French adventurer Théodore Ber, financed by American businessman Henry Meiggs, against Ber’s promise of donating the artifacts he will find, on behalf of Meiggs, to Washington&#x27;s Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Ber’s expedition was cut short by the violent hostility of the local population, instigated by the Catholic parish priest, but von Grumbkow’s early pictures survive.

=== Contemporary excavation and restoration ===
In the 1960s, the Bolivian government initiated an effort to restore the site and reconstruct part of it. The walls of the Kalasasaya are almost all reconstructed. The reconstruction was not sufficiently based on evidence. The reconstruction does not have as high quality of stonework as was present in Tiwanaku. 
Early visitors compared Kalasasaya to Englands Stonehenge. Ephraim Squier called it &quot;American Stonehenge&quot;. Before the reconstruction, it had more of a &quot;Stonehenge&quot;-like appearance as the filler stones between the large stone pillars were all looted.
As noted, the Gateway of the Sun, now in the Kalasasaya, is believed to have been moved from its original location.

Modern, academically sound archaeological excavations were performed from 1978 through the 1990s by University of Chicago anthropologist Alan Kolata and his Bolivian counterpart, Oswaldo Rivera. Among their contributions are the rediscovery of the suka kollus, accurate dating of the civilization&#x27;s growth and influence, and evidence for a drought-based collapse of the Tiwanaku civilization.

Archaeologists such as Paul Goldstein have argued that the Tiwanaku empire ranged outside of the altiplano area and into the Moquegua Valley in Peru. Excavations at Omo settlements show signs of similar architecture characteristic of Tiwanaku, such as a temple and terraced mound. Evidence of similar types of cranial vault modification in burials between the Omo site and the main site of Tiwanaku is also being used for this argument.

Today Tiwanaku has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, administered by the Bolivian government.

Recently, the Department of Archaeology of Bolivia (DINAR, directed by Javier Escalante) has been conducting excavations on the terraced platform mound Akapana. The Proyecto Arqueologico Pumapunku-Akapana (Pumapunku-Akapana Archaeological Project, PAPA) run by the University of Pennsylvania, has been excavating in the area surrounding the terraced platform mound for the past few years, and also conducting Ground Penetrating Radar surveys of the area.

In former years, an archaeological field school offered through Harvard&#x27;s Summer School Program, conducted in the residential area outside the monumental core, has provoked controversy amongst local archaeologists. The program was directed by Gary Urton, of Harvard, who was an expert on quipus, and Alexei Vranich of the University of Pennsylvania. The controversy was over allowing a team of untrained students to work on the site, even under professional supervision. It was so important that only certified professional archaeologists with documented funding were allowed access. The controversy was charged with nationalistic and political undertones. The Harvard field school lasted for three years, beginning in 2004 and ending in 2007. The project was not renewed in subsequent years, nor was permission sought to do so.

In 2009 state-sponsored restoration work on Akapana was halted due to a complaint from UNESCO. The restoration had consisted of facing the platform mound with adobe, although researchers had not established this as appropriate.

In 2013, marine archaeologists exploring Lake Titicaca&#x27;s Khoa reef discovered an ancient ceremonial site and lifted artifacts such as a lapis lazuli and ceramic figurines, incense burners and a ceremonial medallion from the lake floor. The artifacts are representative of the lavishness of the ceremonies and the Tiwanaku culture.

When a topographical map of the site was created in 2016 by the use of a drone, a &quot;set of hitherto unknown structures&quot; was revealed. These structures spanned over 411 hectares, and included a stone temple and about one hundred circular or rectangular structures of vast dimensions, which were possibly domestic units.

== Aerial surveillance ==

Between 2005 and 2007 various types of aerial surveillance methods were used by UNESCO to create an aerial picture of the site. Lidar, aerial photography, drones, and terrestrial laser scanning were all used in this process. Data concluded from this research includes topographical maps that show the principal structures at the site along with mapping of multiple structures in the Mollo Kuntu area. Over 300 million data points were placed from these methods and have helped redefine main structures that have not fully been excavated such as the Puma Punku. 

== Important authors==

Alan Kolata of the University of Chicago conducted research at Tiwanaku in the late 1900s from which he made descriptions of the City and its structure and culture in his book The Tiwanaku. He later published &quot;Valley of The Spirits&quot; which described more aspects of Tiwanaku culture such as astrology and mythology.

John Wayne Janusek of Vanderbilt University spent time in the late 1900s as well at the site of Tiwanaku recording findings of the excavations going on. In 2008 he published &quot;Ancient Tiwanaku&quot; which described his findings on the architecture, agriculture and other aspects of Tiwanaku life.

Jean-Pierre Protzen was an architecture professor of the University of California at Berkeley and spent much of his life studying the architecture of Tiwanaku. In 2013, he published &quot;The Stones of Tiahuanaco&quot; which gives great descriptions of the architecture and stonework seen at Tiwanaku. His work has played a huge role in creating potential reconstructions of what many of the structures look like, especially the puma punku.

== Etymology ==

The town is named after the old &quot;Mo&quot; farm () the town was built up on the outskirts of the large farm. The first element is derived from the word which is the plural form of which means &quot;moorland&quot;. The last element is ( which means &quot;sea&quot; or &quot;seaside&quot;. Mosjøen, therefor means &quot;the sea(side) belonging to Mo&quot;. In other words, it was a place where the farmers of Mo had their boats and boatsheds. Earlier spellings are &quot;Moesøen&quot; in the 18th century and &quot;Mosøen&quot; in the 19th century.

== History ==


Mentioned in Aslak Bolt&#x27;s cadastre of the 15th century, Mo is a medieval farm with a history at least dating to the Viking Age. Mosjøen&#x27;s own history starts in the early modern period. Mosjøen was populated by 1600. The earliest inhabitant known by name is Svein Beachdweller, who lived there together with his wife and daughters in 1660. In the 17th and early 18th century, especially following the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, several inhabitants of Jemtland escaped to Trøndelag and to Nordland. Many of them came to the Vefsna river valley (in present-day Vefsn Municipality), including to the Mosjøen area. In the 18th century, Mosjøen as a settlement for nonagrarian occupations started to materialise. For example, the regional executioner resided there temporarily. As did a handful of craftsmen and public officials.

From the late 16th century until the 1820s, Mo was possessed by the Mo family: wealthy farmers as well as skippers and merchants who contributed to Mosjøen&#x27;s gradual expansion. In 1794, a member of the family received royal privilege to establish a trading post in Mosjøen.

In the 1860s, a group of Englishmen—the &#x27;salmon lords&#x27;—established The North of Europe Land &amp; Mining Company, introducing the first industrial period in Mosjøen. Sawmill industry created &#x27;Klondike conditions&#x27;: People came from everywhere in order to get a job, to trade, and so on, and salaries were relatively high.

On 4 April 1874, King Oscar II decided to grant ladested (town) status to Mosjøen effective on 1 January 1875. As a , Mosjøen now had the privilege to export goods directly to foreign countries. As a new town, it had the right to self-government, so it was separated from Vefsn Municipality to become a separate municipality on 1 January 1876. Initially, the new town had 379 residents. In 1939, a small adjoining area of Vefsn was transferred into the town of Mosjøen. The Cinema Museum in London holds excellent film of the area in 1931 in its collection (ref HMO321) 

As the biggest and most important, central town in the Helgeland region, Mosjøen became northern headquarters of the Nazi German occupiers between 1940 and 1945. After the war in 1945, Mosjøen entered its second industrial period. Among several industrial establishments was Mosjøen Aluminum Plant.

Mosjøen&#x27;s coat of arms was granted by King Olav V on 25 March 1960. Composed by sculptor Arthur Gustavsson, it is blazoned &quot;Sable, a cock Argent&quot;. The cock is traditionally equipped with red beak, wattles, comb, and claws: the so-called colour of armament. The cock represents watchfulness and fighting spirit. After the merger with Vefsn Municipality in 1962, the same coat of arms was adopted for the newly enlarged Vefsn Municipality.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, a major municipal merger took place. The town of Mosjøen (population: 4,628) was merged with Vefsn Municipality (population: 5,358), Drevja Municipality (population: 1,001), and Elsfjord Municipality (population: 920), creating a new municipality called Vefsn. Upon merging, Mosjøen lost its status as a town.
In 1998 (after a change in the national law regarding towns), the municipal council of Vefsn Municipality declared Mosjøen to have the formal status as a town once again.

===Municipal self-government (1875–1962)===
Mosjøen was a self-governing municipality from 1875 until 1962. During that time, Mosjøen was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elected a mayor.

== Geography ==
=== Topography ===
Mosjøen is situated in the lower part of the Vefsn Valley, where the Vefsna and Skjerva rivers flow into the Vefsnfjord. Downtown Mosjøen lies on a flat moorland between these two rivers. Moreover, the town is surrounded by mountains and hills, which are mainly vegetated. Standing immediately west of the town, the tall mountain Øyfjellet dominates the town&#x27;s landscape.

=== Climate ===
Mosjøen is located about south of the Arctic Circle, and the town has an untypical wet and mild boreal climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;), with winter as the wettest season.

<text>(Norwegian; ), (Northern Sami; , or is a town in Sør-Varanger Municipality in Finnmark county, in the far northeastern part of Norway. The town lies on a peninsula along the Bøkfjorden, an arm of the large Varangerfjorden, and is located just a few kilometres from the Norway–Russia border.

The town has a population (2023) of 3,404 and a population density of . When the neighbouring suburban villages of Hesseng, Skytterhusfjellet, Sandnes and Bjørnevatn are all included with Kirkenes, the urban area reaches a population of almost 8,000.

Although Kirkenes is the Norwegian town closest to the Russian border, the town of Vardø to its north is located further east in Norway.

==Names==
Due to its close proximity to Russians, Finns and Skolt Sami, the town is also known as , , and .

==History==
The area around Kirkenes was a common Norwegian–Russian district until 1826, when the present border was settled. The original name of the peninsula was &quot;Piselvnes&quot; (&quot;Pis River headland&quot;), but this was changed to &quot;Kirkenes&quot; (meaning &quot;church headland&quot;) after the Kirkenes Church was built here in 1862. Kirkenes was a village until 1998 when it received town status.

===World War II===

During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Kirkenes was one of the many bases for the German Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Jagdgeschwader 5, and apart from that, the area served as a main base for supplies to the Murmansk front (see Lapland War).

Reportedly, Kirkenes was second after Malta on a list of European towns experiencing air-raid alarms and attacks, with more than 1,000 alarms and 320 air attacks. The town was occupied by the Red Army on 25 October 1944 when the German Wehrmacht was pushed out and fled the area after having destroyed most of the remaining infrastructure. Only 13 houses survived the war.

Close to the town there is a memorial to 11 freedom fighters who helped the partisans collect information about the German occupation. In the summer of 1943, their activities were discovered and many of them were sent to a prisoner-of-war camp near Kirkenes. Following a court-martial the 11 were sentenced to death and were killed near the memorial spot on 18 August 1943. When the common grave was opened in 1946 it was found that the men had been beaten to death. Following the post mortem and memorial service, the bodies were returned to their homesteads.

==Demographics==

The majority of the inhabitants of Kirkenes are of a Norwegian background, and a minority are Sami. Others are originally from Finland, either members of the Kven population or of a newer influx of more or less recent Finnish immigrants. Also, about 500 people are relatively recent Russian immigrants. For several months in 2015, the town served as a border crossing point for Syrian refugees, with hundreds per week crossing the border on bicycles, traveling into Norway from Russia (via Murmansk and Nikel).

==Geography==
Kirkenes is located in the extreme northeastern part of Norway on the Bøkfjorden, a branch of the Varangerfjorden, which is a vast bay connected to the Barents Sea near the Russian–Norwegian border. The town is situated about north of the Arctic Circle, resulting in midnight sun and polar night both lasting for sustained lengths of time depending on season.

Kirkenes is located just east of the 30th meridian east. As a result, it is further east than Istanbul, which marks one of the European borders with Asia. The easternmost point of Norway and the municipality is also at a point further east than Saint Petersburg.

Unlike the vast majority of Norway, Kirkenes is located east of the neighbouring country of Finland. Because of this, travelling directly west from Kirkenes actually changes the time zone forwards instead of backwards, as it usually does. Travelling directly east from Kirkenes (into Russia) changes the time zone forward by an hour in summer, but by two in winter. When Russia implemented permanent daylight saving time between 2011 and 2014, there was a three-hour difference travelling forward from the eastern part of the municipality to westerly Russian areas during winter. Kirkenes shares time zone with areas much further west, e.g. Galicia in Spain which has a solar time difference of 2½ hours.

One can drive south, and walk , into the Øvre Pasvik National Park, reaching the border point of the three countries (Muotkavaara), where the three time zones meet. There are only a few such places in the world. It is forbidden, according to both Norwegian and Russian law, to circumambulate the border marker, as the only lawful route across the Norwegian–Russian border is at the border control at Storskog.

===Climate===
The midnight sun shines from May 17 to July 21. The corresponding polar night extends from November 21 to January 21. Despite its location at the coast, Kirkenes exhibits a more continental subarctic climate (Dfc) than further west along the Northern Norwegian coast. This is due to less maritime air from the west reaching across the land east to Kirkenes. The all-time high was recorded in July 1972 and the record low in January 1999. The coldest low after 2000 was in February 2003. The vegetation is northern taiga, with forest of pine and birch. The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below ) in spring is 26 May and average date for first freeze in autumn is 22 September giving a frost-free season of 116 days (Kirkenes Airport, 1981-2010 average). Kirkenes Airport is situated 5 km outside the town and has been recording since 1940.

==Economy and tourism==


Kirkenes is close to Norway&#x27;s border with Russia, and this location influences the local economy. The Norwegian Barents Secretariat, which works to promote Norwegian-Russian collaboration, is located in Kirkenes.

In 2010, Norway&#x27;s and Russia&#x27;s Foreign Ministers signed an agreement that made it easier for 9,000 Norwegians and 45,000 Russians living near the common border to visit each other.

Tourist attractions include &quot;Grenselandmuseet&quot; (The Border Area Museum), which shows the history of war and peace along the Norwegian–Russian border, Sami art exhibitions by the artist John Savio (1902–1938), and a history of the mining industry in the area. The museum has a small shop and café. Almost every last Thursday of each month the Russian Market takes place on the central square where traders from Murmansk sell their merchandise. Here you can find everything from matryoshkas, linen cloths, and handicrafts, to Russian crystal and porcelain dishes.

Just outside Kirkenes is a military base that is home to the Garrison of Sør-Varanger at Høybuktmoen. Connected to this base are the six border stations along the Russian border. This base and these border stations are there to protect against illegal immigrants as well as other illegal activities across the border. The only public border crossing is at Storskog, southeast of Kirkenes. In October 2023, Norway banned the entry of Russian vehicles with less than 10 seats. In May 2024, Norway closed the entire border for Russian tourists. After this, only a Mercedes van is allowed to cross the border, driving from Norway&#x27;s Kirkenes to the Russian town of Murmansk once a day.

In the city centre of Kirkenes is &quot;Andersgrotta&quot;, a vast underground bunker built during World War II that provided shelter to the town&#x27;s residents. Tours of the bunker are available.

A pride parade held in 2017 in Kirkenes attracted participants from neighbouring Russia, who were unwilling to participate in LGBT events in Russia due to hostility from the government and police. In addition, the parade saw participants from Amnesty International and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee.

Kirkenes&#x27;s location on the Northeast Passage and the effect of climate change on sea ice have led to expressions of interest to develop port and transport infrastructure in the town, including from state-owned enterprises of China. Public reception to such projects in Kirkenes is mixed.

==Transportation==
Kirkenes is one end of the route of the Hurtigruten, which cruises daily up and down the Norway coast to and from Bergen. Kirkenes is served by Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. There are non-stop flights to Oslo, Vadsø, Vardø, Alta and Tromsø. The European route E6 highway has its northern terminus at Kirkenes. The northern terminus of the European route E105 highway is located in Hesseng, just south of the town.

Kirkenes is also the terminus of Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line, the world&#x27;s second-most northerly railway line, used to transport iron ore from the mines at Bjørnevatn to the port at Kirkenes. The proposed Arctic Railway would see Kirkenes connected with northern Finland.

The town of Kirkenes is also the starting point of EV13 The Iron Curtain Trail, a cycling route that runs along the historic border between the capitalist West and the communist East during the Cold War.

==Religion==
The main church for Kirkenes is Kirkenes Church, located in the Haganes area of the town.

<doc id="178826" wikidata="Q185140" url="?curid=178826" title="Joaquin Phoenix">
<text>Joaquin Rafael Phoenix ( ; ; born October 28, 1974) is an American actor. Known for his roles as dark, unconventional and eccentric characters, particularly in period dramas, he has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, a Grammy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards. In 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; named him one of the greatest actors of the 21st century.

Phoenix began his career by appearing in television series in the early 1980s with his brother River. His first major film roles were in &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; (1986) and &quot;Parenthood&quot; (1989). During this period, he was credited as Leaf Phoenix, a name he gave himself. He took back his birth name in the early 1990s and received critical acclaim for his supporting roles in the comedy-drama &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995) and the period film &quot;Quills&quot; (2000). Phoenix received further critical acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Commodus in the historical drama &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000). He had success with the horror films &quot;Signs&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Village&quot; (2004), the historical drama &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; (2004), and won a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of musician Johnny Cash in the biopic &quot;Walk the Line&quot; (2005).

Following a brief sabbatical, Phoenix starred in the psychological drama &quot;The Master&quot; (2012), winning the Volpi Cup for Best Actor and earning his third Academy Award nomination. He gained praise for his roles in the romantic drama &quot;Her&quot; (2013) and the crime satire &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2014), and won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for the psychological thriller &quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot; (2017). For his performance as the titular character of &quot;Joker&quot; (2019), Phoenix won the Academy Award for Best Actor. He has since starred in the independent films &quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot; (2021) and &quot;Beau Is Afraid&quot; (2023), and portrayed the title role in the historical drama &quot;Napoleon&quot; (2023).

Outside acting, Phoenix is an animal rights activist. A vegan, he regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on global meat consumption and its impact on the environment.

==Early life==
Phoenix was born at the Hospital Metropolitano San Francisco in the Río Piedras district of San Juan, Puerto Rico, to John Lee Bottom, the founder of a landscape gardening company, and Arlyn &quot;Heart&quot; Bottom (née Dunetz), an executive secretary at NBC and whose connection to an agent provided her children with acting work. Phoenix is the third of five children, following River (1970–1993) and Rain (born 1972), and preceding Liberty (born 1976) and Summer (born 1977), all of whom have been involved in acting. He also has a paternal half-sister, Jodean (born 1964). His father was a Catholic from Fontana, California, and was of English, German and French ancestry. His maternal grandfather, Meyer Dunetz, was Russian Jewish and his maternal grandmother, Margit Lefkowitz, was Hungarian Jewish; they were both Ashkenazi Jews who resided in New York City. Phoenix&#x27;s parents met when his mother was hitchhiking in California; they married less than a year after meeting.

Soon after their second child was born, they joined the religious cult Children of God and travelled throughout the Caribbean and South America as missionaries, where the next two children were born. They eventually became disillusioned with the group and left in 1977, being opposed to the cult&#x27;s increasingly distorted rules, particularly the practice of flirty fishing. The fifth child was born in Florida where the family settled; around this time they legally adopted the surname Phoenix, inspired by the mythical bird that rises from its own ashes, symbolizing a new beginning. When Joaquin was three, he and his older siblings witnessed fish being stunned as &quot;they were throwing them against the side of the boat&quot;, prompting the whole family to convert to a vegan lifestyle. At this time, Phoenix first referred to himself as &quot;Leaf&quot;, having been inspired by spending time outdoors raking leaves and wanting a nature-related name like his siblings&#x27;. He reverted to his birth name, Joaquin, at age 15.

==Career==
===1980–1993: Early work and family tragedy===
In 1979, when Phoenix&#x27;s father had to stop working because of an old spinal injury, the family moved to Los Angeles where the mother met a high-profile child agent named Iris Burton, who got the children into commercials and bit parts on TV. Phoenix made his acting debut alongside his brother in the television series &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; in the 1982 episode &quot;Christmas Song&quot;. He has said of his first acting experience:
In 1984, Phoenix starred opposite his brother River in the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; entitled &quot;&quot;, for which they shared a nomination for Best Young Actor in a Family Film Made for Television at the 6th Youth in Film Awards. He also made guest appearances in the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode &quot;We&#x27;re Off to Kill the Wizard&quot;, and individual episodes of &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. A year later, he appeared in the television film &quot;Kids Don&#x27;t Tell&quot;. To supplement their income, the kids sang their original songs like &quot;Gonna Make It&quot;, written by River, and busked for money in matching yellow shirts and shorts. They also studied dance; Phoenix became an avid breakdancer. He dropped out of high school when he was sent a dead frog in the mail to dissect for his biology studies. Dissatisfied with life in Los Angeles, the Phoenixes moved back to Florida, settling in Gainesville.

Phoenix made his feature film debut in the adventure film &quot;SpaceCamp&quot; (1986) as a young boy who goes to Kennedy Space Center to learn about the NASA space program and undergoes amateur astronaut training. He guest-starred in the anthology series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;A Very Happy Ending&quot; that year, playing a child who blackmails a hitman into killing his father. Phoenix&#x27;s first starring role was in the film &quot;Russkies&quot; (1987), about a group of friends who unknowingly befriend a Russian soldier during the Cold War.

In 1989, Phoenix co-starred as Garry, the withdrawn teenage nephew of Steve Martin&#x27;s character in Ron Howard&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Parenthood&quot;. It was a box office success, grossing worldwide against its budget. Critics praised the film, with &quot;IndieWire&quot; reviewers highlighting the film&#x27;s cast and their performances for possessing &quot;genuinely likable, and occasionally insightful, heart&quot; calling Phoenix a &quot;terrifically believable angsty adolescent&quot;, in a performance which garnered him a nomination for the Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actor in a Feature Film. The role of Garry was reprised in the series based on the film by Leonardo DiCaprio, who studied Phoenix&#x27;s performance &quot;to get it right&quot;. After establishing himself as a child actor, Phoenix felt he was not getting any appealing offers; he decided to take a break from acting and traveled to Mexico with his father, learning Spanish. When he returned to the States, his brother River suggested that Phoenix change his name back to Joaquin and encouraged him to start acting again.

On October 31, 1993, River died of a drug overdose outside The Viper Room in West Hollywood. Phoenix, who had accompanied his brother and older sister Rain to the club, called 911 to seek help for his dying brother. After the death, the phone call was repeatedly broadcast on TV and radio shows. The family retreated to Costa Rica to escape the media glare as the event came to be depicted as a cautionary tale of young Hollywood surrounded by mythology and conspiracy.

===1994–1999: Return to acting===
Phoenix returned to acting in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s 1995 black comedy &quot;To Die For&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Maynard, which in turn was inspired by the Pamela Smart murder case. Phoenix starred as Jimmy Emmett, a disturbed young man who is seduced by a woman (Nicole Kidman) to commit murder. The film premiered at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival and became a financial and critical success, with &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin praising Phoenix&#x27;s performance, writing &quot;So pity poor Jimmy. Rivetingly played by Mr Phoenix with a raw, anguished expressiveness that makes him an actor to watch for, Jimmy is both tempted and terrified by Suzanne&#x27;s slick amorality. In that, he speaks for us all.&quot;

In 1997, Phoenix played a small-town troublemaker in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;U Turn&quot;, and a poor man in love with a rich woman in &quot;Inventing the Abbotts&quot;. The films were received with mostly mixed and negative reviews, respectively, and neither performed well at the box office. The following year, Phoenix starred in &quot;Clay Pigeons&quot; as a young man in a small town who befriends a serial killer. The film was released to a dismal box office performance and was not well received by critics. In his next film, &quot;8mm&quot; (1999), Phoenix co-starred as an adult video store employee who helps Tom Welles (Nicolas Cage) investigate the underworld of illegal pornography. The film turned out to be a box office success, grossing worldwide, but found few admirers among critics.

===2000–2010: Critical acclaim and commercial success===
In 2000, Phoenix co-starred in three films. In the first of these, he portrayed a fictionalized version of Roman Emperor Commodus in Ridley Scott&#x27;s historical epic film &quot;Gladiator&quot;. The film received positive reviews and grossed worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2000. Chris Nashawaty of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Phoenix&#x27;s work &quot;a more nuanced star-making performance&quot; when comparing him to the lead Russell Crowe, writing &quot;Phoenix turns what could have easily been a cartoonish villain into a richly layered study of pathology.&quot; Phoenix earned his first nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Award in the Best Supporting Actor category. He and his late brother River became the first brothers to be nominated for acting Academy Awards. To this date, they are the only brothers to hold this distinction.

His next film marked his first collaboration with director James Gray in &quot;The Yards&quot;. The crime film follows the corruption in the rail yards of Queens. Although failing to perform well at the box office, &quot;The Yards&quot; received positive reviews from critics with many considering Phoenix&#x27;s performance as the villain a stand out. The third release of 2000 was Philip Kaufman&#x27;s &quot;Quills&quot;, a satirical thriller inspired by the life and work of the Marquis de Sade. Phoenix portrayed the conflicted priest Abbé de Coulmier opposite Kate Winslet. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and was a modest art house success grossing a total of at the box office. It was received with critical praise with Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praising Phoenix and his chemistry with Winslet, stating &quot;Phoenix, on a roll this year with Gladiator and The Yards, excels at making the priest a seductive figure—a neat trick considering the real Abbe was a four-foot hunchback. Winslet and Phoenix generate real fire, notably when Abbe dreams of ravishing Madeleine on the altar.&quot; For his combined roles of that year, Phoenix was awarded the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor and the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor.

The following year, Phoenix starred in the satirical film &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; as a U.S. Army soldier. The world premiere was held at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival in early September. However, because the film was a satire of the US military, its wider theatrical run was delayed by approximately two years because of the September 11 attacks; it was finally released on July 25, 2003. &quot;BBC&quot;&#x27;s Nev Pierce wrote that &quot;Phoenix is excellent as a Gen X Sergeant Bilko, ensuring his cheerfully amoral character never loses heart—showcasing tenderness, love, grief and fear as his games get out of control&quot; and Phoenix received a nomination for the British Independent Film Award for Best Actor.

The science fiction thriller &quot;Signs&quot; (2002) marked Phoenix&#x27;s first collaboration with director M. Night Shyamalan. In the film, he played Merrill Hess, a former Minor League baseball player who, along with his older brother Graham (Mel Gibson), discovers that Earth has been invaded by extraterrestrials. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but Phoenix&#x27;s performance was praised, with critic Peter Travers writing that Phoenix &quot;registers impressively, finding the humor and the pain in this lost boy [...] never making a false move as a helpless Merrill watches his rock of a brother crumble into a despairing crisis of faith.&quot; The film was a commercial success, grossing worldwide.

In 2003, Phoenix played the irresolute husband of a superstar-skater (Claire Danes) in Thomas Vinterberg&#x27;s romance-drama &quot;It&#x27;s All About Love&quot;, and voiced Kenai in the Disney animated film &quot;Brother Bear&quot;. Phoenix expressed immense joy being cast as the lead voice role in a Disney animated feature, stating &quot;The real pinnacle [in my career] is that I&#x27;m playing an animated character in a Disney film. Isn&#x27;t that the greatest?&quot; The film grossed worldwide, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. He was replaced by Patrick Dempsey in the sequel &quot;Brother Bear 2&quot;. Phoenix reunited with Shyamalan in the period thriller &quot;The Village&quot; (2004). The film is about a village whose population lives in fear of creatures inhabiting the woods beyond it, referred to as &quot;Those We Don&#x27;t Speak Of&quot;. He played farmer Lucius Hunt, a role which Christopher Orr of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; found &quot;underdeveloped&quot;. Though initially receiving mixed reviews, the film attracted retrospective reviews years after its release. Several critics deemed it one of Shyamalan&#x27;s best films, praising Phoenix&#x27;s &quot;terrific&quot; performance. The film was a financial success, grossing worldwide on its budget.

In his next film of the year, he starred opposite John Travolta in the drama film &quot;Ladder 49&quot; as a Baltimore firefighter. In preparation for the role, Phoenix trained for two months with the Baltimore Fire Department, putting out actual fires. He admitted that he was afraid of heights before he started making this film, recalling &quot;I got to the pole and I looked down and I couldn&#x27;t do it. But you go through the training and it exposes your fears and helps you to overcome them. We ended up rappelling off a six-story tower and that really helped.&quot; The film earned at the box office despite receiving generally mixed reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the performances in the film. Phoenix&#x27;s final film of 2004 was Terry George&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;, playing cameraman Jack Daglish. Based on the Rwandan genocide, the film documents Paul Rusesabagina&#x27;s (Don Cheadle) efforts to save the lives of his family and more than 1,000 other refugees by providing them with shelter in the besieged Hôtel des Mille Collines. The film was a moderate financial success but was a critical success, receiving almost exclusively positive reviews from critics. For his performance in the film, Phoenix was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award along with the cast.

In 2005, Phoenix co-starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in the James Mangold directed film &quot;Walk the Line,&quot; a Johnny Cash biopic, after Cash himself approved of Phoenix. All of Cash&#x27;s vocal tracks in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack are played and sung by Phoenix. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival, eventually grossing worldwide. Phoenix&#x27;s performance received rave reviews from critics and it inspired film critic Roger Ebert to write, &quot;Knowing Johnny Cash&#x27;s albums more or less by heart, I closed my eyes to focus on the soundtrack and decided that, yes, that was the voice of Johnny Cash I was listening to. The closing credits make it clear it&#x27;s Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked&quot;. For his portrayal of Johnny Cash, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Phoenix also received a second Academy Award nomination, his first in the Best Actor category as well as a second BAFTA nomination. Earlier that year, he narrated &quot;Earthlings&quot; (2005), a documentary about the investigation of animal abuse in factory farms, and pet mills, and for scientific research. He was awarded the Humanitarian Award at the San Diego Film Festival in 2005, for his work and contribution to &quot;Earthlings&quot;. Animal rights philosopher Tom Regan remarked that &quot;for those who watch &quot;Earthlings&quot;, the world will never be the same&quot;.

Phoenix&#x27;s first producing task was the action thriller &quot;We Own the Night&quot; (2007), in which he played nightclub manager Bobby Green/Grusinsky who tries to save his brother (Mark Wahlberg) and father (Robert Duvall) from Russian mafia hitmen. The James Gray-directed film premiered at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival to mixed reviews; Roger Ebert praised Gray&#x27;s direction and the acting, but criticized its screenplay for lack of originality. David Edelstein of &quot;New York&quot; magazine commended Phoenix for elevating the film&#x27;s conflict, writing that it &quot;might be heavy-handed without Phoenix&#x27;s face—his irresolution somehow more powerful than other actors&#x27; resolve. There is no artifice. He&#x27;s not an actor disappearing into a role but a man disappearing into himself [...] Phoenix homes in on the truth of this person. It&#x27;s the paradox of the greatest acting&quot;.

Later that year, he played a father obsessed with finding out who killed his son in a hit-and-run accident in his second feature with Terry George, the crime drama film &quot;Reservation Road&quot;. The film received mixed reviews from critics; Peter Travers praised Phoenix&#x27;s acting stating &quot;Even the best actors—and I&#x27;d rank Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Ruffalo among their generation&#x27;s finest—can&#x27;t save a movie that aims for tragedy but stalls at soap opera.&quot; Phoenix also executive produced the television show &quot;4Real&quot;, a half-hour program which began airing in 2007. The series showcased celebrity guests on global adventures &quot;in order to connect with young leaders who are creating social and economic change&quot;.

In 2008, Phoenix starred as a suicidal bachelor torn between the family friend his parents wish he would marry and his beautiful but volatile new neighbor in Gray&#x27;s &quot;Two Lovers&quot;. The romantic drama premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. Reviews for the film and Phoenix&#x27;s performance were positive; &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;″s chief critic called it his best performance to date and Ray Bennett of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt that Phoenix led the film with &quot;great intelligence and enormous charm, making his character&#x27;s conflict utterly believable&quot;. During the promotion of &quot;Two Lovers&quot;, Phoenix had started to film his next performance for the mockumentary film &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; (2010), which the media felt overshadowed the former&#x27;s theatrical release. &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; purports to follow the life of Phoenix, from the announcement of his retirement from acting, through his transition into a career as a hip hop artist managed by rap icon Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs. Directed by Phoenix&#x27;s then brother-in-law Casey Affleck and co-written by Affleck and Phoenix, the little-seen film premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival to mixed reviews; critics were divided on whether to interpret the film as documentary or performance art. After its release, Phoenix explained that the idea for the feature arose from his amazement that people believed reality television shows&#x27; claims of being unscripted. By claiming to retire from acting, he and Affleck planned to make a film that &quot;explored celebrity, and explored the relationship between the media and the consumers and the celebrities themselves&quot; through their film.

===2011–2019: Established career and continued acclaim===
In 2011, it was announced that Phoenix would star in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s drama film &quot;The Master&quot;, which traces the relationship between Freddie Quell (Phoenix), a World War II navy veteran struggling to adjust to a post-war society and Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a leader of a religious movement known as &quot;The Cause&quot;. To create the character, Phoenix lost a significant amount of weight and went to a dentist to help force his jaw shut on one side; a trait his own father had. The film premiered at the 2012 Venice Film Festival where he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor. The art house film only grossed but was received with critical acclaim, with Phoenix&#x27;s performance receiving high praise. Peter Travers called it the performance of his career writing &quot;Acting doesn&#x27;t get better or go deeper[...]Phoenix wears the role like a second skin. You can&#x27;t take your eyes off him.&quot; His performance as Freddie was described as &quot;career-defining&quot; by Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, who was impressed that Anderson and Phoenix collaboratively were able to build such complex work around such a derelict figure. Fellow actor Daniel Day-Lewis publicly lauded the &quot;remarkable&quot; Phoenix while accepting the Screen Actors Guild Award, apologizing for the fact that Phoenix hadn&#x27;t been nominated for the same award. Despite this, Phoenix received his third Academy, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for his leading role.

Phoenix and Gray&#x27;s fourth collaboration came with &quot;The Immigrant&quot; (2013), a drama film in which he played the supporting role of a pimp who prostitutes Polish immigrant Ewa (Marion Cotillard) and ends up falling for her. &quot;The Immigrant&quot; and his performance premiered to highly positive reviews at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In his review, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; thought the film featured one of his best performances and commended Phoenix&#x27;s and Gray&#x27;s developing work, writing of that &quot;the two are so perfectly in sync, that it&#x27;s hard to tell where Phoenix&#x27;s performance ends and Gray&#x27;s visual style[...]—begins&quot;, further lauding their development of Bruno into &quot;a fully fledged tragic character, even though he is neither the protagonist of &quot;The Immigrant&quot; nor the main driving force behind its plot&quot;.

His next feature film of that year was the Spike Jonze-directed romantic science-fiction drama &quot;Her&quot;. He played Theodore Twombly, a man who develops a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), an intelligent computer operating system personified through a female voice. Released to critical acclaim, critic A.A. Dowd of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; labeled Phoenix as &quot;one of the most emotionally honest actors in Hollywood&quot;, impressed at how he effortlessly unleashes waves of vulnerability in the film&#x27;s many tight, invasive close-up images, calling it a &quot;tremendous performance, one that rescues this character—a mess of insecurities, regrets, and desires—from the walking pity party he could have been&quot;. &quot;Her&quot; earned more than double of its production budget, and Phoenix received his fourth nomination at the Golden Globes. Several journalists expressed disappointment over his failure to receive an Oscar nomination for it, with Peter Knegt of &quot;IndieWire&quot; naming it of one of ten worst Oscar acting snubs of the last decade in 2015.

In 2014, Phoenix took on the role of Doc Sportello, a private investigator and hippie/dope head trying to help his ex-girlfriend solve a crime in the crime comedy-drama &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;, based on Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s detective novel of the same name. Reviews toward the film were positive; critics praised Phoenix&#x27;s performance and Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s direction, while some were frustrated by its complicated plot. Robbie Collin of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; termed Phoenix as Anderson&#x27;s &quot;perfect leading man&quot; and his work as &quot;the kind of quietly dazzling performance that rarely wins awards but will be adoringly dissected and quoted for decades&quot;. Phoenix earned his fifth Golden Globe nomination for the film.

After narrating the sequel to &quot;Earthlings&quot;, the 2015 animal rights&#x27; documentary &quot;Unity&quot;, Phoenix teamed with director Woody Allen and Emma Stone in the crime mystery film &quot;Irrational Man&quot;. He played Abe Lucas, a philosophy professor experiencing an existential crisis. The film was released to mixed reviews at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt that the film was too similar to Allen&#x27;s previous films, but praised Phoenix&#x27;s chemistry with Stone and Phoenix for playing the character &quot;with a wonderful baggy, lived-in quality that makes us want to climb inside the character&#x27;s whiskey-sozzled head&quot;.

The thriller &quot;You Were Never Really Here&quot;, written and directed by Lynne Ramsay and based on the novella of the same name by Jonathan Ames, ranks among the most acclaimed films of Phoenix&#x27;s career. The film is about Joe (played by Phoenix), a traumatized former FBI agent and Gulf War veteran who tracks down missing girls for a living. To prepare for the film, Phoenix was advised by a former bodyguard who goes on international missions to rescue children suffering sexual exploitation and abuse by human traffickers; he gained a significant amount of weight and muscle for the part. Phoenix was Ramsay&#x27;s first and only choice to play the veteran, with Ramsay calling him &quot;my soulmate in making movies&quot;. The film premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where earned Phoenix the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor. Justin Chang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described Phoenix&#x27;s performance as &quot;the most rivetingly contained&quot; work of his career and Dominick Suzanne-Mayer of &quot;Consequence&quot; noted that his evocative manners in the film, led to him giving career-high work and &quot;the kind of haunting turn that only comes around a few times every decade or so&quot;.

In 2018, Phoenix portrayed Jesus in the biblical drama &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;, written by Helen Edmundson and directed by Garth Davis. The film, and his performance, received mixed reviews; a reviewer for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; thought that Phoenix lacked the quiet compassion and grace that was required for the role, while Nick Allen of Roger Ebert&#x27;s website described his performance as &quot;a human being who is visibly tormented by the power and wisdom that works through him&quot;, deeming it one of the best portrayals of Jesus ever. His next two features the biopic &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry, He Won&#x27;t Get Far on Foot&quot; and the crime drama &quot;The Sisters Brothers&quot; were much better received. In the former, Phoenix reunited with his &quot;To Die For&quot; director Gus Van Sant to portray quadriplegic cartoonist John Callahan. Barry Hertz of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that there&#x27;s no better leading actor producing better work than Phoenix, stating &quot;The actor—never a simple chameleon, but someone who disappears into a role entirely with a frightening conviction—continues to display new and tremendous range here&quot; and David Hughes of &quot;Empire&quot; thought that in a more conventional film, Phoenix would be the favorite to win an Academy Award.

The third film of 2018 was &quot;The Sisters Brothers&quot;, Jacques Audiard&#x27;s adaptation of the novel of the same name by Patrick deWitt. The film starred John C. Reilly and Phoenix as the notorious assassin brothers Eli and Charlie Sisters respectively and chronicles their chase after two men who have banded together to search for gold. Writing for Roger Ebert&#x27;s website, Tomris Laffly commented on Phoenix&#x27;s and Reilly&#x27;s &quot;tremendous chemistry&quot; and Lindsey Behr of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; opined that the duo &quot;excellently manage all the various tones in the film&quot; they also shared credit with Jake Gyllenhaal and Riz Ahmed .
Also in 2018, he collaborated with Rooney Mara and Sia to narrate Chris Delforce&#x27;s documentary &quot;Dominion&quot;. Animal rights activists have called it one of the most powerful documentaries ever made. For his contribution to the documentary, Phoenix was granted the 2018 Award of Excellence for Narration by Hollywood International Independent Documentary Awards.
In 2019, Phoenix starred as the DC Comics character Joker in Todd Phillips&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;Joker&quot;; an alternative origin story for the character. Set in 1981, the film follows Arthur Fleck, a failed clown and stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying Gotham City. Phoenix lost in preparation, and based his laugh on &quot;videos of people suffering from pathological laughter&quot; they also shared credit with Robert De Niro . Released to critical acclaim at the 76th Venice International Film Festival, the film experienced a polarized critical reception after its theatrical release. While Phoenix&#x27;s performance received rave reviews, the dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinions and generated concerns of inspiring real-life violence; the movie theater where the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, mass shooting occurred during a screening of &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; refused to show it. Despite this, &quot;Joker&quot; became a box office success grossing over (against its production budget), the first R-rated film to do so, becoming Phoenix&#x27;s highest-grossing film.
Pete Hammond of &quot;Deadline&quot; wrote of Phoenix&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary&quot; performance, describing it as &quot;dazzling risky and original&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s David Rooney called his performance the &quot;must-see factor&quot; of the film, writing &quot;he inhabits [the character] with an insanity by turns pitiful and fearsome in an out-there performance that&#x27;s no laughing matter[...]Phoenix is the prime force that makes Joker such a distinctively edgy entry in the Hollywood comics industrial complex.&quot; The film earned him numerous awards, including an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, a SAG and a Critic&#x27;s Choice Award for Best Actor.

===2020–present: Frequent A24 collaborations and career fluctuations===

In 2020, Phoenix served as an executive producer on &quot;Gunda&quot;, directed by Viktor Kossakovsky. The acclaimed documentary follows the daily life of a pig, two cows, and a one-legged chicken. That same year, Phoenix was named on the list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The list was compiled by famed critics Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott and Phoenix&#x27;s paragraph was written by his frequent collaborator, director James Gray.

In 2021, he starred in Mike Mills&#x27; drama &quot;&quot;C&#x27;mon C&#x27;mon&quot;&quot;, as Johnny, a radio journalist who embarks on a cross-country trip with his young nephew. The A24 film premiered at the 48th Telluride Film Festival where it scored the best per-venue average for a limited release since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic upon its release. Angelica Jade Bastién of &quot;Vulture&quot; praised Phoenix, writing &quot;a tremendous showing from Joaquin Phoenix, operating at a register he&#x27;s rarely found before. It&#x27;s a career best for him—lovely, empathetic, humane[...]He possesses a warmth that glows from beginning to end. As Johnny, Phoenix listens to people and the world around him with full-bodied curiosity. This is where the bravura lies in the performance: his ability to seemingly just be.&quot;

Phoenix starred as Beau Wassermann, the title character in Ari Aster&#x27;s surrealist black tragicomedy &quot;Beau Is Afraid&quot; (2023), which was released on April 14, 2023, before a wide release the following week. In it, he portrays a mild-mannered but paranoia-ridden man who embarks on a surreal odyssey to get home to his mother, confronting his greatest fears along the way. The actor shared the cast with Amy Ryan, Nathan Lane and Patti LuPone. The film received generally favourable reviews, with critics crediting Aster&#x27;s direction and Phoenix and his &quot;sheer commitment&quot; to the role, for giving the film its &quot;undeniable power&quot;. Tomris Laffly of &quot;TheWrap&quot; called his performance as Beau &quot;one of his best performances&quot;, praising his ability to act with &quot;a startling level of vulnerability[...]both enigmatic and translucently bare&quot;. Phoenix received his seventh Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the film.

Phoenix portrayed Napoleon Bonaparte in &quot;Napoleon&quot;, his second collaboration with director Ridley Scott, released in November 2023, with Vanessa Kirby as Joséphine de Beauharnais. The film grossed over and received mixed reviews (though mostly negative reviews in France), mostly criticized for its pacing and historical inaccuracies. For example, the French GQ magazine called the film &quot;deeply clumsy, unnatural, and unintentionally awkward.&quot; In 2024, Phoenix reprised his role as Joker in Phillips&#x27; sequel &quot;&quot; with Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. Unlike the first film, it emerged as a critical and commercial failure.

Phoenix will next reunite with Lynne Ramsay in &quot;Polaris&quot;, co-starring Rooney Mara, and with Ari Aster in the contemporary Western film &quot;Eddington&quot;. He was originally set to star alongside Danny Ramirez in a film by Todd Haynes, a sexually explicit &quot;love story between two men&quot; set in 1930s Los Angeles. Phoenix had co-written it with Haynes, advising him to &quot;go further&quot; with the explicit material, which Haynes said would have likely made it an NC-17 rated film. The project was cancelled when Phoenix abruptly exited five days before filming began.

==Reception and acting style==
At the beginning of his career, Phoenix was often referred to as &quot;the second most famous Phoenix&quot;, his name associated most closely with the death of his brother River Phoenix. The media would often compare the two, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing Joaquin as &quot;sweetly unsettling and endlessly vulnerable&quot; compared to his brother&#x27;s &quot;pure all-American blond boyishness&quot;. After his brother died, Phoenix gained a reputation for his distrust of the media, with many speculating that it is derived from how River&#x27;s death was covered by the press. He was often asked about the day River died, and still is to this date. Phoenix has described these interviews as &quot;insincere&quot; and has felt that they impeded on the mourning process.

Caroline Frost of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; has said that Phoenix is &quot;engaging, engaged, mischievous, honest&quot; in person and Anderson Cooper of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; thought that he was &quot;wry, shy and couldn&#x27;t be any more friendlier&quot; adding that Phoenix &quot;just doesn&#x27;t like to talk about himself&quot;. Although known for his intensity and darkness on-screen, director James Gray who worked with Phoenix in four feature films, says that Phoenix is very different off-screen saying &quot;He&#x27;s actually very tender and sweet and sensitive. It&#x27;s almost as if he channels his intensity into the characters. Like the work is an outlet for his darker side.&quot;

Phoenix has been described as one of the finest actors of his generation. As he achieved stardom after &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), he was conveniently ruled out of teen-idol roles because of his hard gaze and scarred lip. Justin Chang, analyzing his career in &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2020, remarked that filmmakers immediately seemed to recognize that Phoenix was more than a heartthrob, and that there was &quot;something more tortured, more vulnerable and infinitely more interesting at play beneath the surface&quot;. He noted that through his work, Phoenix is challenging and redefining cinematic manhood and that this quality sets him apart from most of his contemporaries. Film critic and film historian Leonard Maltin has called Phoenix &quot;a true chameleon&quot;, writing 
&quot;[Phoenix] commands the screen and breaks your heart; he makes us feel it all vicariously.&quot;

Phoenix is particularly known for his ability to heavily commit to each role he plays and his intense preparations, deeply immersing himself in the characters, often blurring the lines between fiction and reality. That immersion was particularly evident during the filming of the mockumentary &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; (2010), when Phoenix announced to the world that he was retiring from acting to become a rapper. Throughout the filming period, Phoenix remained in character for public appearances, giving many the impression that he was genuinely pursuing a new career. Media outlets worldwide believed that Phoenix was having a mental breakdown after his infamous appearance on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Confusion from the media turned to concern as the seemingly drug-addled Phoenix continued his attempts to convince crowds he was serious about a rap career. Many worried his erratic behavior was a sign he was stuck in a downward spiral, and headed down the same self-destructive path that took the life of his older brother. Although widely suspected to be a mockumentary, the fact that the events of the film had been deliberately staged was not disclosed until after the film had been released. To this day, some people believe he went through a personal meltdown during the filming period. Phoenix has credited the making of &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; for allowing him to make bolder choices in acting.

Phoenix contends there&#x27;s no real methodology to the roles he chooses, but has said that he is drawn to complex characters. He speculates that his affinity for dark roles derives from something more ineffable, possibly prenatal saying that &quot;I think there is a combination of nature and nurture[...]—and some of it is my upbringing.&quot; Even so, Phoenix remains reluctant to draw a line between his unusual childhood, his private tragedy and his talent for &quot;inhabiting the morose, damaged, violent, and otherwise anxiety-riddled characters&quot;. James Gray has described Phoenix as &quot;one of the most incorruptible people I&#x27;ve ever known, and the least superficial&quot;, and has spoken of his acting, saying that he admires Phoenix&#x27;s &quot;limitless ability to surprise you in the best ways and inspire you to move in a direction that you haven&#x27;t thought of originally, better than what you have in mind&quot;.

Garth Davis, who directed Phoenix in &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot; (2018), has remarked that he does not apply method acting, but said that working with Phoenix is like &quot;working with this beautiful wild animal, where you have to give him the space to be free, so his performance can roam freely: raw, uncontrived and truly natural. If he smells the design of the scene, you lose his free spirit; if the script is weak, he will expose its flaws. He is fiercely intelligent and almost completely instinctual. And he has this immense sensitivity that can be both his curse and his gift, but for me, that is what it means to be human&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2015, Phoenix said that he prefers independent film over major studio film, citing that &quot;the quality of acting suffers&quot;.

In 2019, Phoenix stated that in choosing films, he solely relies on the director, &quot;I don&#x27;t really care about genre or budget size, anything like that. It&#x27;s just whether there is a filmmaker that has a unique vision, has a voice, and the ability to make the film.&quot; For Phoenix, a great performance is in the director&#x27;s hands — it&#x27;s ultimately the director&#x27;s world he&#x27;s entering. He maintains that the director creates the character&#x27;s arc and that the best directors adjust to what is happening with the actor in the moment.

Phoenix has cited Robert De Niro as one of his favorite actors and strongest acting influences. Phoenix recalled watching &quot;Raging Bull&quot; for the first time in an interview, &quot;I think it just… awakened something in me. And I could suddenly see it through his eyes. There&#x27;s a part in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; where De Niro meets a girl in between a chain-link fence. And he, you know, shakes her pinky and it&#x27;s like this just beautiful little detail, it&#x27;s this wonderful moment. And I think that in some ways is what I&#x27;m always looking for.&quot;

==Other ventures==
===Music===
Phoenix has directed music videos for Ringside, She Wants Revenge, People in Planes, Arckid, Albert Hammond Jr., and Silversun Pickups. He was said to have produced the opening track for Pusha T&#x27;s &quot;My Name Is My Name&quot; album alongside Kanye West. The track is called &quot;King Push&quot;. Phoenix then denied in a statement to &quot;XXL&quot; having produced the record, saying, &quot;While it was widely reported that Pusha T used my beat and that I produced his song, I can&#x27;t take any credit. A friend&#x27;s son played me his music, and all I did was make an introduction to Kanye [West]&#x27;s camp.&quot;

===Animal rights activism===
Phoenix is identified as one of the most active celebrities in the animal rights movement. A vegan since age three, he does not wear any clothes made out of animal skin; he requests that all of his leather costumes in films are made from synthetic materials. Phoenix has said that animal rights are one of the most important pillars in his life, and maintains that &quot;climate change is imminent if we do not adopt a plant-based lifestyle&quot;. He has helped raise awareness of the correlation between animal rights, climate change and health issues.

Phoenix has received praise and accolades from animal rights groups, with PETA naming him &quot;Person of the Year&quot; in 2019. PETA&#x27;s president, Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement: &quot;Joaquin Phoenix never misses an opportunity to turn the spotlight away from himself and onto animals&#x27; plight and to set a great example of walking the vegan walk&quot;. He has been an active supporter of numerous animal rights organizations, including PETA.
Throughout the years, Phoenix has headlined numerous campaigns for different organizations to help promote veganism and end animal slaughter. In 2019, Phoenix and his partner Rooney Mara led the National Animal Rights Day demonstration to help spread awareness for animal rights. On January 10, 2020, Phoenix was arrested with actress Jane Fonda at a climate change protest outside the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. At the protest, Phoenix spoke about the link between animal agriculture and climate change.

Phoenix has also been vocal in drawing attention to the suffering of fish, which he sees as a neglected cause in the sphere of animal rights. Fish, says Phoenix, are the &quot;last thing besides insects that people don’t really consider&quot;. Phoenix&#x27;s views were shaped by a childhood incident in which he saw fish brutally flung against the side of the boat. In 2013, he simulated drowning in a 41-second PETA spot, designed to dramatise how fish suffer in the final moments of their lives. The video was shot by photographer Michael Muller. 

During the 2019–20 awards season, amid protesting for animal rights, Phoenix had been driving a behind-the-scenes movement that transformed five events to meat-free menus, beginning with the Golden Globe Awards. He acknowledged the Hollywood Foreign Press Association during his acceptance speech, for its &quot;very bold move making tonight plant-based. It really sends a powerful message.&quot; Soon after, Critics&#x27; Choice and SAG followed suit. Phoenix contacted the presidents of the award ceremonies, accompanied by signatures from the likes of fellow nominees Leonardo DiCaprio and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. Phoenix&#x27;s pitch was that meat agriculture is a leading cause of climate change and that the televised spectacles should use their platforms to address pressing societal issues. The Academy Awards later announced that all food served at the Dolby Theatre before the Oscars was going to be vegan. Lisa Lange, Senior Vice President of Communications at PETA, spoke of Phoenix&#x27;s power saying &quot;He knows what can be done. He knows he&#x27;s in a good position to push. He enlists friends. And it works. He can have influence in Hollywood and it influences the rest of the world.&quot;

A day after winning the Academy Award for Best Actor, and subsequently delivering a headlining acceptance speech in which he spoke to the plight of mother cows and their babies used in animal agriculture, Phoenix helped to rescue a cow and her newborn calf from a Los Angeles slaughterhouse. They were taken to Farm Sanctuary, an animal sanctuary and advocacy organization, where they will live out the rest of their lives. The same month, he starred in &quot;Guardians of Life&quot;, the first of twelve short films by the environmental organization Mobilize Earth that highlighted the most pressing issues facing humanity and the natural world. Funds raised by the project went to Amazon Watch and Extinction Rebellion. Dávid Szőke and Sándor Kiss in Film International were highly critical of this move, arguing that &quot;what is rather mind-boggling is that the discourse centers less on the issue of the calf and its mother or the exploitation of our natural world, and more on Phoenix in the leading role as the savior of our planet, raising questions about the narrative’s alignment with his environmental activism.&quot;

Two animal species have been named after him. In 2011, a trilobite species was named &quot;Gladiatoria phoenix&quot; for his iconic role in the 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot;, and in 2020, a spider species endemic to Iran was named &quot;Loureedia phoenixi&quot; (also known as the Joker spider) due to its color pattern matching the DC Comics character Joker, for his role in the 2019 film &quot;Joker&quot;.

===Other activism===
In 2020, Phoenix collaborated with JusticeLA to create a public service announcement #SuingToSaveLives about the health of people in L.A. County jails amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2023, Phoenix signed an open letter by artists to President Joe Biden calling for a ceasefire during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. The letter reads: &quot;We believe all life is sacred, no matter faith or ethnicity and we condemn the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians.&quot;

==Personal life==
===Views and lifestyle===
After reestablishing himself as an actor in the mid-1990s, Phoenix moved back to Los Angeles. He is known for his disdain of celebrity culture, rarely granting interviews, and being reticent about discussing his private life. In 2018, he described himself as a secular Jew who did not affiliate with any organized religion; one of his &quot;core values&quot; is the idea of forgiveness. He has also claimed that his mother believes in Jesus, though his parents were not religious. While portraying Jesus in the 2018 movie &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;, he expressed that the role changed his perspective on the nature of forgiveness.

In early April 2005, Phoenix checked himself into rehab to be treated for alcoholism. Twelve years later, he revealed that he did not need an intervention: &quot;I really just thought of myself as a hedonist. I was an actor in L.A. I wanted to have a good time. But I wasn&#x27;t engaging with the world or myself in the way I wanted to&quot;. On January 26, 2006, while driving down a winding canyon road in Hollywood, Phoenix veered off the road and flipped his car. The crash was reportedly caused by brake failure. Shaken and confused, he heard someone tapping on his window and telling him to &quot;just relax&quot;. Unable to see the man, Phoenix replied, &quot;I&#x27;m fine. I am relaxed.&quot; The man replied, &quot;No, you&#x27;re not.&quot; The man then stopped Phoenix from lighting a cigarette while gasoline was leaking into the car cabin. Phoenix realized that the man was German filmmaker Werner Herzog. While Herzog helped Phoenix out of the wreckage by breaking the back window of the car, bystanders called an ambulance. Phoenix later approached Herzog to express his gratitude.

In 2012, Phoenix labeled the Academy Awards &quot;bullshit&quot;. He later gave an interview apologizing for his comments, and acknowledged that the awards provided an important platform for many deserving filmmakers. He elaborated on the topic while on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in 2015, explaining that he was uncomfortable receiving accolades for his work, considering the filmmaking process a collaborative one.

A longtime vegan, Phoenix finds animal agriculture &quot;absurd and barbaric&quot;. He explained his reasoning behind his veganism: &quot;To me, it just seems obvious—I don&#x27;t want to cause pain to another living empathetic creature. I don&#x27;t want to take its babies away from it, I don&#x27;t want to force it to be indoors and fattened up just to be slaughtered. Certainly, also, the effect that it has on our environment is devastating. So, for me, it&#x27;s my life and has always been my life, and it&#x27;s really one of the most important things to me.&quot;

Phoenix is on the board of directors for The Lunchbox Fund, a non-profit organization which provides daily meals to students of township schools in Soweto, South Africa, founded by Page-Green.

===Relationships and family===
From 1995 to 1998, Phoenix dated his &quot;Inventing the Abbotts&quot; co-star Liv Tyler. The two remain close friends, with Tyler considering Phoenix and his sisters as her family. He was romantically involved with South African model Topaz Page-Green from 2001 to 2005. From 2013 to 2015 he was in a relationship with artist Allie Teilz. 

In 2012, Phoenix met &quot;Her&quot; co-star Rooney Mara. The two remained friends and began a romantic relationship four years later, during the making of &quot;Mary Magdalene&quot;. They were engaged to be married in 2019, but the ceremony never took place. In August 2020, the couple had a son. In June 2024, they welcomed their second child. They reside in the Hollywood Hills. Phoenix has described his family life as simple. He enjoys meditating, watching documentaries, reading scripts, and taking karate classes. He has a black belt in karate.
In September 2024, Joaquin Phoenix formalized his marriage with Rooney during Talk Easy podcast.

<text>Leirvik is a town and the administrative centre of Stord municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The town lies along the southern coast of the large island of Stord, along the Hardangerfjorden. The town gained &quot;town status&quot; in 1997. The town includes the Eldøyane peninsula where the large Kværner Stord industrial area is located.
Leirvik is the regional centre of the traditional district of Sunnhordland, and has many public services and offices such as the Sunnhordland District court and the Sunnhordland Museum, as well as many shops and restaurants. Stord Church and several schools such as Stord Upper Secondary School and Western Norway University of Applied Sciences are all located in the town.

The town has a population (2019) of 14,126 and a population density of . The entire municipality has about 18,700 residents in it (2019), so Leirvik has about 75% of the total population of the municipality. Leirvik is also the largest urban area that is located in a municipality where Nynorsk is the preferred language form.

==Transportation==
The town lies along the European route E39 highway, just east of the Stord Bridge which is part of the Triangle Link which connects a number of islands to the mainland via road bridges and an undersea tunnel. There is a ferry quay at Skjersholmane in the western part of the town which has regular ferry connections to the nearby islands of Halsnøya, Fjelbergøya, and Borgundøya which lie to the east in the Hardangerfjorden. A regular ferry connection to the nearby island of Huglo departs just north of Leirvik at the quay at Jektavik. In the main harbour of Leirvik, there are several daily expressboat departures to nearby islands of Halsnøy, Fjellbergøy and Borgundøy as well as the villages of Husnes, Skånevik and Ølen and the county capital of Bergen. Stord Airport is located approximately 12 kilometers west of Leirvik center close to the village of Sagvåg. From the main bus terminal of Leirvik, there are local busses, as well as regional express busses towards Bergen to the north and Stavanger to the south. 

==Media==
The newspaper &quot;Sunnhordland&quot; is published in Leirvik, as well as the online newspaper Stord24. NRK also has a local office in Leirvik.

==Name==
Confusingly, when the municipality of Stord declared that Leirvik was a town in 1997, they decided to name the town &quot;Stord&quot;, with the village of Leirvik being the central part of the town. This was done because the Norwegian government required a populated place to have at least 5,000 residents in order to be called a town. Leirvik alone did not have enough residents unless the whole surrounding areas were also included, so the name &quot;Stord&quot; would represent the whole area. Even though this is the official name, the public acceptance of this has been minimal and controversial, and the name of the urban community remains &quot;Leirvik&quot;.

The name Leirvik () translates into &quot;clay bay&quot;. The word &quot;leire&quot; meaning &quot;clay&quot; and &quot;vik&quot; meaning &quot;bay&quot;. The name comes from the high concentration of clay in the ground. The locals often colloquially refer to Leirvik by the name &quot;Vikjo&quot;, meaning &quot;the bay&quot; in local dialect, rather than &quot;Leirvik&quot;.

<doc id="178831" wikidata="Q956690" url="?curid=178831" title="Cornwall, Ontario">
<text>Cornwall is a city in Eastern Ontario, Canada, situated where the provinces of Ontario and Quebec and the U.S. state of New York converge. It is Ontario&#x27;s easternmost city. Although it is the seat of the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry, Cornwall is administered independently from the county.

Cornwall is named after the English Duchy of Cornwall; the city&#x27;s coat of arms is based on that of the duchy with its colours reversed and the addition of a &quot;royal tressure,&quot; a Scottish symbol of royalty.

It is the urban centre for the surrounding communities of Long Sault and Ingleside to the west; the Mohawk Territory of Akwesasne to the south; St. Andrews West and Avonmore to the north; and Glen Walter, Martintown, Apple Hill, Williamstown, and Lancaster to the east.

The city straddles the St. Lawrence River and is home to the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation, which oversees navigation and shipping activities for the St. Lawrence Seaway. It lies within the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor along Ontario Highway 401, is a major port of entry from the United States into Canada, and is positioned to support some of Cornwall&#x27;s largest industries, which include logistics, distribution, and call centres.

== History ==
Though accounts suggest Europeans filtered into the area and had scattered settlements for some time, the first documented European settlement was established in 1784 by United Empire Loyalists, primarily from the former British colony of New York.
In 1787 this settlement became the first in present-day Ontario to be visited by a member of the royal family, Prince William Henry (later William IV).

After the war for US independence, former colonial soldiers loyal to the Crown and other disbanded soldiers and their families began to settle at the site of Cornwall, which was then called New Johnstown. Many of the new arrivals were of ethnic German, Acts and English origin, and the town is named for Johnstown, New York, the origin of many of them.

The main group was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Johnson and had soldiers from the First Battalion King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York and a contingent of the 84th Royal Highland Emigrants. Following the success of rebellious colonists in the American Revolution, many of those who were afraid for their lives or uncomfortable in the newly independent United States became United Empire Loyalists as they were later called, and migrated to Canada. The British government helped them settle throughout the Canadas as a reward for their loyalty and to compensate them for their losses in the United States. One of the chief settlement regions was the St Lawrence River Valley, from Kingston to Cornwall, which would later be known as &quot;Loyalist Country.&quot;

They founded a permanent settlement north of one of a series of portage points (the point was not a settlement, nor was it even a trading post), sometimes referred to as &quot;Pointe Maligne&quot; by French explorers. The square mile town was temporarily named &quot;Royal Town #2&quot; then &quot;Johnson&quot; or &quot;New Johnstown.&quot; It was later renamed to Cornwall for the Duke of Cornwall by the proclamation of Prince George. In 1834, the town became one of the first incorporated municipalities in the British colony of Upper Canada. Much later, during one of a series of annexations, those former portage points were added to the expanded community.

During the War of 1812, the Battle of Hoople&#x27;s Creek and the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm were fought nearby. Cornwall was occupied by the United States Army from November 11-13, 1813. 

The construction of the Cornwall Canal between 1834 and 1842 accelerated the community&#x27;s development into a regional and industrial economic &quot;capital&quot; for a growing hinterland of towns and villages.

In 1846, the population was about 1,600, and there were many brick and stone houses, a stone courthouse and jail, and several government offices. There was little industry except for a foundry and two tanneries, but there were many independent tradesmen of various types. Other amenities included two bank agencies, eight taverns, and a ladies&#x27; school.

Canal and lock construction in the late 1800s and the early 1900s brought work and international business. The Grand Trunk Railway (CN Rail) built an east-west line through Cornwall in 1856. The New York and Ottawa Railway (NY&amp;O) followed with a north-south line crossing the St. Lawrence, and a station in Cornwall dating to 1898. The Canadian Pacific Railway created a succession of subsidiaries and plans for a Cornwall line starting in the 1880s, which culminated in the Glengarry and Stormont Railway in 1915 to connect to CP&#x27;s Ontario and Quebec Railway mainline to the northeast for an alternative route to Montreal.

In 1879, a visitor from Scotland enthusiastically declared that the Lochaber dialect of Scottish Gaelic language was better preserved, &quot;with the most perfect accent, and with scarcely any, if any, admixture of English&quot;, in Glengarry County and in Cornwall than in Lochaber itself.

The railway connections linked Cornwall and local communities that required access to public services in Cornwall itself, such as high schools and medical services, and helped cement Cornwall&#x27;s position as a regional centre for a large, rapidly expanding, and increasingly populated rural hinterland. The network of villages and towns surrounding Cornwall helped make the city a local entrepot for business, commerce, media and services.
In 1944, the city was rocked by the magnitude 5.8 Cornwall–Massena earthquake. There were no deaths or injuries reported, but several chimneys were destroyed or damaged, along with heavy damage to historical masonry structures. For example, the Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School received heavy damage from masonry work falling through the roof of the gymnasium. Part of the school had to be demolished and reconstructed.

West of Cornwall, along the St. Lawrence River, there were several smaller communities that became known as the Lost Villages. They were submerged in 1958 during the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway, providing a reservoir for the Moses-Saunders Power Dam, which regulates water levels flowing from Lake Ontario and maintains the levels required to operate the two adjacent Canada-US hydroelectric power generating stations.

== Ethnic history ==
The post-contact regional population was a mixture of French Canadian, Ojibwe and Mohawk residents. Then came an influx of American Loyalists and refugees from the Thirteen Colonies, along with other French Canadian and Acadian migrants. Then poor Scottish and Irish immigrants and refugees who arrived from overseas and other parts of Canada. The different groups mixed and integrated over time, with family names and histories reflecting a blending of different backgrounds that became typical of Eastern Ontario.

Smaller but impressive contributions in the region were made by a host of other migrants, from Jewish traders, craftsmen, and merchants to Eastern European refugees and even a significant body of former slaves. Many of the stories go unreported in standard histories, which pass over the remarkable history of migration in the region. One good example is the story of John Baker, who died in Cornwall in 1871 at the age of 93. Born in Lower Canada, he was said to be the last Canadian born into slavery and had been an active soldier in the War of 1812 who fought in both Canada and Europe. Slavery was ended in the colony of Upper Canada in stages; in 1793, the importing of slaves was banned, and in 1819, Upper Canada Attorney-General John Robinson declared all slaves in the colony to be freed, making Upper Canada the first place in the British Empire and even the world that unequivocally moved towards the formal abolition of chattel slavery. Most of the former slaves settled and integrated into the same communities in which they were freed. By 1833, this process of liberation had succeeded throughout the British Empire by the decision to free all of its slaves. It was the first major state in world history to abolish slavery, and Ontario was the place where the process first bore fruit. John Baker, the last slave to be born into slavery in Canada, died in Cornwall.

&quot;Canada&quot; had been conquered from France after the Seven Years&#x27; War and included roughly the areas covered by Quebec and Ontario. In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the British authorities divided the Province of Canada in 1791 into two: Upper Canada for English settlers fleeing persecution in the United States and Lower Canada for the French. That was designed to accommodate Loyalists who had fled postwar reprisals and persecution in the new United States, but the 5,000 English-speaking settlers in the Eastern Township of Quebec were allowed to stay in the French-speaking area, and many French settlers moved into Ontario. Along with the area&#x27;s original inhabitants, that made the area a patchwork of intersecting ethnicities that later greatly intermingled. Cornwall and the surrounding area, originally called &quot;Royal Settlement #2&quot; and then &quot;New Jamestown,&quot; was initially a rough place and was largely left to its own devices. According to contemporary reports, that bred a local culture of intense self-reliance. Adding to the initial history of pragmatic entrepreneurialism, since very early with the founding of the city, provincial and federal governments have typically neglected the area and treated it as little more than a transit corridor. Those who remained in the region tended to be those who had the fortitude and the energy to survive on their own, with little outside assistance.

&quot;The original 516 settlers arrived in Royal Township #2 with minimal supplies and faced years of hard work and possible starvation. Upon their departure from military camps in Montreal, Pointe Claire, Saint Anne, and Lachine in the fall of 1784, Loyalists were given a tent, one month&#x27;s worth of food rations, clothes, and agricultural provisions by regiment commanders. They were promised one cow for every two families, an axe, and other necessary tools in the near future. For the next three years, bateaux (boat) crews delivered rations to the township, after which residents were left to fend for themselves.&quot;

The region&#x27;s energetic spirit of enterprise and fortitude was well-known in the 19th century. David Thompson, the Welsh-Canadian explorer who mapped the Far West and was called the greatest land geographer in history, drew many of his travelling companions from Cornwall&#x27;s rural hinterland, with Scottish and native settlers, and he lived in Williamstown.

More recently, Cornwall has seen an increase in the arrival of new immigrants, who tend to integrate and often fare better than immigrants in other parts of the country.

=== Integration ===

The Cornwall region was unusually integrated for rural counties in Ontario. For hundreds of years, the local population has been characterized by a mix of economic migrants, refugees, and opportunists. The mixing of different social classes and ethnic backgrounds was common even early in its history because of the interdependence demanded by isolation and the lack of support from or interference by official authorities.

The original Native population was remarkably welcoming, and the Iroquois were especially well known for integrating newcomers into local societies and for adapting to change as it happened. Many people in the region have some Native ancestry as a result, and many communities sit on sites that have been occupied, farmed, or managed for hundreds of years. Some people were pushed out, but others simply blended into new communities in a process that would go on continuously over many generations.

The lack of strict hierarchy was a characteristic of the region. For example, from the 1780s to the 1830s, a &quot;bee&quot; was a social event that pooled local labour resources for people to come together for collective projects or to help out individual families, and it was often a festive occasion. The early &quot;bees&quot; presaged the development of a varied and integrated culture that ultimately drew on many different classes, backgrounds, and ethnic and linguistic groups, all of which were forced by the harsh reality of life in the region to work together for common goals, the primary of which was survival. The &quot;bees&quot; and different forms of collective shared labour were extremely common all over Eastern Ontario, especially in the early villages of the St. Lawrence Valley.

&quot;In her book &#x27;Roughing It in the Bush,&#x27; Susanna Moodie observed that &#x27;people in the woods have a craze for giving and going to bees and run to them with as much eagerness as a peasant runs to a race.&#x27; Bees often involved all ranks and nationalities of society. Thomas Need, a sawmill operator in Victoria County, described in &#x27;From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns&#x27; the raising of his facility in 1834 in the following way: &#x27;They assembled in great force, and all worked together in great harmony and goodwill notwithstanding their different stations in life.&#x27; These gatherings exhibited the lack of aristocracy in the rural loyalist settlement along the St. Lawrence River and residents&#x27; disregard for individuals&#x27; former social standing or lineage. The harshness and isolation of frontier living prevented the development of an aristocracy and, instead, united all members of the community in a struggle for survival. Early Loyalists, regardless of the amount of land they owned, depended upon the help of their neighbours to clear land, build homes, and share supplies and food during times of poor harvests.&quot;

==Geography==
=== Environment ===
Cornwall does not enjoy a positive environmental reputation as a result of decades of industrial pollution in the city, the legacy of which is a riverfront contaminated by mercury, zinc, lead, and copper, soil contaminated by coal tar and byproducts, and most evidently, &quot;Big Ben&quot;, an , dumpsite within the city filled with wood bark, paper mill sludge, demolition waste and asbestos.

In September 2008, over public opposition and in spite of Ontario Ministry of Environment (M.O.E.) reports indicating off-site leachate impact from the dump and the likelihood of runoff to the St. Lawrence River, the M.O.E. permitted additional dumping at the &quot;Big Ben&quot; site of creosote and bitumen-contaminated soils from Domtar&#x27;s former No-co-rode Ltd. site.

Although the area is touted as recreational, it is off-limits until winter when the waste is covered and the odours are subdued. It is then used as a ski hill.

For years, the industrial emissions in the Cornwall area fuelled public health concerns about respiratory disease and cancer. In 1995 Health Canada reported the rate of hospitalization for asthma was approximately double that of Ontario industrial cities such as Hamilton, Sudbury and Windsor. Further research showed that infants under two years of age had four times the expected hospital admission rate for asthma. Lung and male rectal cancer rates were also elevated in comparison with the rest of the province.

The shutdown of the Courtaulds rayon fiber operation (1992) and the Domtar paper mill (2006) has been a significant factor in the city&#x27;s improved air quality. Cornwall consistently ranks in the top 10 of 40 monitored communities across Ontario. More recently, a Pembina Institute study of 29 communities across Ontario examined a number of environmental, social, and economic factors. Cornwall ranked 13th overall, and its air quality was ranked #1 in the province.

Cornwall was at one point one of only two cities left in the Province of Ontario with only primary sewage treatment facilities. But construction was started in May 2012 on the secondary treatment level plant with the Governments of Canada and Ontario each covering one-third of an estimated $55.5 million construction cost. The City picked up the remaining one-third of the cost of $18.5 million. The secondary treatment level plant was completed in November 2014.

In 2006, the City updated its Strategic Plan, including the objective to develop an environmentally sustainable community.

In 2007, a former city councillor, Naresh Bhargava, began working with the St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences on a project called the Community Carbon Reduction Initiative. City Council provided $5,000 in start-up funding for the project. Earlier progress in energy conservation was made when in 1995, the first municipally owned hot water district heating and cogeneration system in Canada went into operation, providing about 4% of the city&#x27;s daily electrical needs while at the same time heating a number of buildings, including a hospital site, schools, and a municipal library. Cornwall converted all of its traffic signals in 2002 to energy-efficient LEDs that have reduced power usage by more than 600 kW—enough to light close to 70 homes. The data was contained in a report prepared by the city&#x27;s public works department.

=== Climate ===
Similar to most of Southern Ontario, Cornwall has a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and warm, humid summers. Precipitation is significant year-round, although the winter months are generally drier than the summer months.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cornwall had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As of 2021, 9.9% of Cornwall residents were visible minorities, 5.6% were Indigenous, and the remaining 84.5% were white/European. The largest visible minority groups were South Asian (5.1%) and Black (1.7%).

In 2021, 66.3% of the population were Christian, down from 83.0% in 2011. 50.1% of residents were Catholic, 9.8% were Protestant, 3.4% belonged to other Christian denominations or Christian-related traditions and 3.1% were Christian n.o.s. 26.8% of the population were non-religious or secular, up from 12.1% in 2011. The largest non-Christian religion was Islam, accounting for 3.7% of residents, up from 2.4% in 2011. Hinduism was the second largest, at 1.8% of residents, up from 1.5% in 2011. All other religions and spiritual traditions accounted for 1.4% of the population.

== Economy ==
Cornwall has traditionally been a gateway from the Montreal area to the rest of Canada and was and remains a major port of entry into Canada (Canada Border Services abandoned the Cornwall Island post on May 31, 2009, but resumed service on July 13, 2009, at temporary facilities on the city&#x27;s southern edge.) With the completion of the new low-level bridge connecting Cornwall to Cornwall Island, the C.B.S.A. port was moved to a permanent temporary facility on the canal lands. The city is connected to the United States at Roosevelttown near the municipalities of Massena, New York and Malone, New York via the Three Nations Crossing (Canada, Mohawk, and United States) which traverses the St. Lawrence River.

Cornwall was once home to a thriving cotton processing industry. Courtaulds Canada, Inc.&#x27;s viscose rayon manufacturing mill operated until 1992; at one point, it employed nearly 3,000 people. A Cellophane factory was opened in 1971 by British Cellophane, a subsidiary of Courtaulds, as an ancillary to the rayon plant, and traded successively under the names TCF of Canada Limited, BCL Canada Inc. and Courtaulds Films; it too closed in 1992. Domtar, a Quebec-based company, operated a paper mill in the city for nearly 100 years, ceasing operations on March 31, 2006. At its peak, Domtar employed nearly 1,500 employees. In addition, Canadian Industries Limited (C.I.L.) has operated a plant in Cornwall since 1935. The facility has been converted into a major derivatives plant. The site has a long history of mercury contamination, given that for decades the chloralkali process was carried out here. This entailed using used mercury cells to convert brine into caustic soda and chlorine.

Cornwall&#x27;s industrial base has shifted to a more diversified mix of manufacturing, automotive, high-tech, food processing, distribution centres and call centres. The city hosts the largest supply chain management distribution centre in Canada, Walmart, its massive facility employing nearly 1,000 people. Target Canada built a new distribution centre in Cornwall&#x27;s Business Park on a parcel of land. The Target Canada distribution centre was operated by Eleven Points Logistics. When Target left Canada, its distribution centre was assumed by Walmart. StarTek (&quot;closed&quot;), and Teleperformance &quot;(closed January 2013)&quot; both operated call centres in Cornwall. Teleperformance provided in excess of 300 jobs. In late 2008, Shopper&#x27;s Drug Mart built a . distribution facility in Cornwall&#x27;s Business Park. Over 130 new jobs resulted. Service Canada established a new contact centre which opened in 2010. Over 170 new jobs were created. Cornwall&#x27;s unemployment rate was about 4% at the time.

 Cornwall Square, also known as &quot;The Square,&quot; is a two-level shopping mall in Cornwall on Water Street East, opposite to Lamoureux Park.

In 2016, Cornwall had the 11th-lowest household median income in Canada and the second-lowest in Ontario, at $51,712.

== Government ==
=== Municipal ===
The Cornwall City Council is governed by an elected eleven-member municipal government composed of a mayor and ten councillors who serve four-year terms and represent the city as a whole. The mayor of Cornwall is Justin Towndale, having been elected in 2022, defeating interim mayor Glen Grant who was appointed by council shortly after mayor Bernadette Clement was appointed to the Senate of Canada in June 2021.

At the 2010 municipal election, 56.5% of eligible voters did not vote as out of 30,655 registered voters, only 13,338 cast ballots (43.5%).

=== Provincial ===
Cornwall is located within the Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry riding, which is represented by MPP Nolan Quinn (Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario).

=== Federal ===
Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry is represented federally by Member of Parliament (MP) Eric Duncan (Conservative). John Sandfield Macdonald, the first Premier of Ontario, was from Cornwall and is buried in St. Andrews West at the Catholic Church cemetery. A heritage plaque facing York Street at 211 Water Street West commemorates the 1897 launch of Cornwall&#x27;s first permanent hospital in the former John Sandfield Macdonald house at that location.

== Culture ==
The City of Cornwall hosts festivals and special community events, including Canada Day festivities. In 2018, it purchased a building in the downtown core to house its arts and culture centre. The Focus Arts Association organizes multiple exhibitions and coordinates events where artists can connect with and support other artists. Your Arts Council, created to provide artists and the community with the tools and resources they need, offers programs aimed at promoting the work of local artists.

=== Theatre ===
The Aultsville Theatre, named after one of the Lost Villages, is a 680-seat performing arts centre on the St. Lawrence College campus and funded in part by the City of Cornwall. The Port Theatre, built in 1941, hosts movies and live music on its stage. Founded in 2006, the Seaway Valley Theatre Company offers plays, musicals, and comedy shows with cabaret-style seating.

=== Museum ===
Cornwall is home to the Cornwall Community Museum, which is operated by the SD&amp;G Historical Society. In 2022, the United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada relocated its Dominion Office, library, and archives from Toronto to the museum. 

=== Gallery ===
The Cline House Gallery offers Cornwall and the surrounding area rotating exhibitions of visual art featuring the work of both local and visiting artists. The Cailuan Gallery offers local artwork and an ongoing Special Selections exhibition.

=== Library ===
The Cornwall Public Library, located in the downtown core, is housed in the former 1953 Cornwall Post Office building, which was renovated and designated a heritage site by the Cornwall Municipal Heritage Committee in 1997.

=== Kinsmen Cornwall Lift-Off ===
Lift Off was an annual music and hot air balloon festival that took place in July in Lamoureux Park. It was run by a board of volunteers and was a non-profit organization. The event was the only hot air balloon festival in Ontario. Paying individuals could take a 20- or 90-minute ride in one of 25 sponsored balloons.

Kinsmen Cornwall Lift-Off promoted a variety of local and national talent. Acts included Glass Tiger, Theory of a Deadman, Marianas Trench, Our Lady Peace, Finger Eleven, Kim Mitchell, Sass Jordan, Tom Cochrane, Trooper, Burton Cummings, and David Wilcox. The 2014 lineup featured Great Big Sea&#x27;s Alan Doyle, Glass Tiger and 54-40 as headliners. This edition was the first to offer a full day of free entertainment, with Glass Tiger headlining. It was attended by over 9,000 people.

2014 was the final year for the Lift-Off festival, as debt from a weather-plagued 2013 event and failure to obtain sponsors forced the cancellation of Lift-Off 2015 and resulted in a decision to discontinue the festival.

=== Ribfest ===
Cornwall Ribfest is an annual festival held by the Optimist Club of Cornwall. It was originally sponsored by the Cornwall Seaway Lions Club. Taking place over four days in late July, Ribfest attracts many for barbecue, beer tent, free live music and midway rides. The 2014 edition of the festival attracted 57,000–60,000 attendees, a number greater than the population of the city. In 2024 the Crash Test Dummies headlined the festival attracting visitors from across the province and upwards of 80,000 people over the weekend.

=== Cadet Program ===
Cornwall is home to all three elements of the Canadian Cadet Organization: 325 Cornwall Kiwanis Royal Canadian Air Cadets, 110 Stormont Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, and 2403 SD&amp;G Royal Canadian Army Cadets Corps. The cadet program is designed for youth aged 12 to 18 and aims to develop leadership, citizenship, and self-confidence through various activities. The Canadian Cadet Organization operates as a youth group through a partnership between the Canadian Department of National Defence and the respective Elemental Leagues. The program focuses on enhancing youth development in areas such as leadership, citizenship, and physical fitness. The 325 Cornwall Kiwanis Squadron is one of the most active cadet units in the Eastern Ontario Region, offering a diverse range of activities including band, canoeing, marksmanship, flying, camping, and various day trips. 

== Sports ==

Cornwall has two indoor arenas, the Cornwall Civic Complex and the Benson Centre, with three ice surfaces.

Hockey

Cornwall has been home to a variety of sports teams, the most notable of which was the Cornwall Royals hockey team. The Royals played in both the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and the Ontario Hockey League before moving to Newmarket in 1992. The Royals won the Memorial Cup in 1972, 1980, and 1981.

From 1993 to 1996, the Cornwall Aces were an AHL franchise, like the Cornwall Royals, that played at the Ed Lumley Arena in the Cornwall Civic Complex. They were the farm team for the NHL franchises, the Quebec Nordiques and the relocated Colorado Avalanche.

The Cornwall Colts is the current Junior A team playing in the Central Canada Hockey League. Cornwall has hosted several major sporting events in its history, including the Ontario Winter Games and Special Olympics. In 2008, Cornwall hosted the Royal Bank Cup, the National Championship for Junior A hockey teams. The Cornwall Colts finished third in the series, winning 2 of 5 games. The Cornwall Colts hosted the Fred Page Cup in 2015 for the Eastern Canadian Championship. The teams represented in the Fred Page Cup are the Maritime Hockey League Champions (Kent Cup), the Ligue de Hockey Junior AAA du Québec Champions (Napa Cup), the Ottawa District champions of the Central Canada Hockey League (Bogart-Nielsen Cup), and a host team chosen by committee two years before the tournament.

The Cornwall River Kings of the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey (LNAH) started playing out of the Cornwall Civic Complex in the fall of 2012 but folded in 2016. The River Kings were replaced by the Cornwall Nationals of the Federal Hockey League, which folded during the 2017–18 season.

Soccer

Cornwall has three soccer areas, the Kinsmen Junior Soccer Field at Second Street West and Haulage Road; The Benson Centre (for indoor soccer); and Optimist Park on Sunnyside Street and St. Michel Drive.

Rugby

Cornwall has competitive men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby clubs. After many years without rugby in the community, it saw a resurrection in 2006. Both teams compete in the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union, which is located in Ottawa. The home of the Cornwall Crusaders Rugby Football Club is Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams practice Tuesdays and Thursdays from April until the end of August. The men&#x27;s team won the Eastern Ontario Men&#x27;s Division 1 Championship in 2009 and 2010 against the Napanee Outlaws and the Gatineau Mirage, respectively.

The sport of rugby continues to grow in the community. Many high schools throughout Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry have junior and senior boys&#x27; teams as well as varsity girls&#x27; teams. These high school teams serve as feeders to the Cornwall Crusaders. Many of the players who play for the Crusaders come from high schools in the S.D.&amp; G. area.

Roller Derby The Seaway Roller Derby Girls Association is the first roller derby flat track roller derby league in Cornwall and SD&amp;G Counties, established in 2011. The Power Dames is the first official team.

Girls&#x27; basketball The United Counties girls&#x27; basketball team won provincial and international basketball tournaments in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In addition, the city offered girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s basketball from age eight to college graduates. The San Lawrence College women&#x27;s team also won a college tournament. The teams were coached by Adelore Bergeon and Alan Haskvitz.

== Transportation ==
=== Rail ===
The Grand Trunk Railway (CN Rail) built an east-west line through Cornwall in 1856, and its original station dated to that year. The New York and Ottawa Railway (NY&amp;O) followed with a north–south line crossing the St. Lawrence, with a station in Cornwall dating to 1898. Canadian Pacific created a succession of subsidiaries and plans for a Cornwall line starting in the 1880s, culminating in the Glengarry and Stormont Railway in 1915, which connected to CP&#x27;s Ontario and Quebec Railway mainline to the northeast, creating an alternative route to Montréal.

The expansion of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s significantly disrupted the city&#x27;s rail infrastructure, resulting in CN relocating its line northward and the NY&amp;O abandoning its line altogether. A new CN passenger station, which is still in use by Via Rail, was constructed in 1957, and the century-old Grand Trunk station was demolished shortly after, in 1962. The NY&amp;O&#x27;s passenger service ended in 1957, and its passenger station was demolished in the 1960s as well. CP passenger service ended even earlier, in 1952, and the CP passenger station was demolished in 1969. CP abandoned the line altogether in 1995.

Currently, Cornwall only has one significant rail line, the CN Kingston Subdivision, which functions as the CN mainline between Toronto and Montreal. It also serves as a component of Via Rail&#x27;s Québec City-Windsor corridor. Passenger trains between Montréal and Toronto stop at the Cornwall railway station, which is located in the city&#x27;s north end. Via&#x27;s High-Frequency Rail (HFR) proposal, which would generally improve passenger rail service in Eastern Ontario, would not pass through Cornwall as most of the service improvements are planned to be focused on new lines constructed on abandoned rail rights of way as well as existing Via-owned lines such as the Via Brockville Subdivision.

==== Street railway ====

Around the turn of the 20th century, Cornwall had a burgeoning electric street railway system, which transported freight and passengers throughout the city. The Cornwall Electric Street Railway began passenger operations in 1896 and freight operations in 1899. Passenger operations ended in 1949 with a switch to trolleybus service, and electric freight operations ended in 1971 with the system&#x27;s sale to CN Rail and subsequent dieselization. During its time, the street railway was significant in the city&#x27;s social and industrial development. Ultimately, its passenger tram service, after conversion to trolleybus, became the present-day Cornwall Transit, which provides municipal diesel bus service to this day.

=== Public transit ===

With a fleet of 24 buses, Cornwall Transit operates six days a week (excluding Sundays and holidays) on fixed routes and supplementary rush-hour routes. In addition, there is an on-demand &quot;Handi-Transit&quot; service for the disabled. Cornwall Transit also contracts taxi service at a flat rate for Handi-Transit registrants who are ambulatory. The City-operated transit system transports approximately 860,000 passengers every year.

=== Air ===
Cornwall is served by the Cornwall Regional Airport, which is located east of the city near Summerstown. It is open year-round and licensed for day and night VFR IFR operations. The facilities include a runway, a terminal, hangar, and the Canada Border Services Agency (on request). Domestic and international charter flying service from the airport is offered by Cornwall Aviation.

Massena International Airport in New York is 20 minutes by car from Cornwall.

=== Sea ===
The City of Cornwall is on the St. Lawrence Seaway just east of the Eisenhower and Snell Locks. The Cornwall Harbour and Government Wharf are located on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River in the city&#x27;s east end.

== Education ==
Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School became a grade 7–12 school after amalgamating with General Vanier Intermediate School for the 2011–12 school year. The school celebrated its bicentennial in 2006 and is one of the oldest schools in Canada. CCVS offers a complete French immersion program in grades 7–12.

St. Joseph&#x27;s Secondary School is a part of the Catholic District Board and offers French immersion education. The newest high school in Cornwall is Holy Trinity Catholic Secondary School for grades 7 to 12, opened in response to overpopulation at St. Joseph&#x27;s. Both schools offer French immersion education.

Cornwall also has two French high schools: l&#x27;École secondaire publique l&#x27;Héritage, and l&#x27;École secondaire catholique La Citadelle. La Citadelle is part of the Roman Catholic separate, French language school board for the Southeastern region of Ontario (CSDCEO). It is home to students from grade 7 to 12. École secondaire publique l&#x27;Héritage is part of the public school board responsible for education in the French language in Eastern Ontario (CEPEO) and is home to grade 7 through 12 students.

St. Lawrence Secondary School hosts students in grades 7–12. It was originally St. Lawrence High School, located where La Citadelle is now. Around 2003, it was turned into a school for grades 7–10. It has transitioned back into a high school for grades 7–12. 2012 was to be the first year since 2003 that grade 12s would graduate from the school.

The Statistics Canada 2016 census education profile indicates that 40% of Cornwall&#x27;s population has a post-secondary certificate, diploma, or degree.

A campus of St. Lawrence College is situated in Cornwall. The St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences is located on the college campus and, among other academic and vocational offerings, provides an Environmental Technician program. The St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences is a research centre that carries out ecotoxicological studies on large river systems and, in particular, on the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence River ecosystem.

Al-Rashid Islamic Institute is the first Islamic school of any kind in North America, providing higher education in Islamic studies with a boarding facility.

The Seaway Valley Meat Cutting Institute is located in Cornwall and offers apprenticeship programs.

Cornwall is home to the Canadian Forces School of Aerospace Control Operations (CFSACO). CFSACO offers a range of basic and specialty courses and conversion training to Canadian Forces personnel. Military members are trained to become either Air Traffic Controller/Operators or Air Weapons Controller/Operators.

Nav Canada, Canada&#x27;s air navigation service provider, formerly conducted training for domestic Air Traffic Controllers in Cornwall at the Nav Canada Training Institute and Conference Centre. The facility was purchased in March 2022 by the Devcore Group and rebranded as the DEV Hotel and Conference Centre. Nav Canada leases a portion of the property and continues operations on the site, hosting training for technical operations and leadership.

<text>Guelph ( ; 2021 Canadian Census population 143,740) is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. Known as The Royal City, it is roughly east of Kitchener and west of Downtown Toronto, at the intersection of Highway 6, Highway 7 and Wellington County Road 124. It is the seat of Wellington County, but is politically independent of it.

Guelph began as a settlement in the 1820s, established by John Galt, who was in Upper Canada as the first superintendent of the Canada Company. He based the headquarters, and his home, in the community. The area—much of which became Wellington County—was part of the Halton Block, a Crown reserve for the Six Nations Iroquois. Galt is generally considered Guelph&#x27;s founder.

For many years, Guelph ranked at or near the bottom of Canada&#x27;s crime severity list. However, the 2017 index showed a 15% increase from 2016. It had one of the country&#x27;s lowest unemployment rates throughout the Great Recession. In late 2018, the Guelph Eramosa and Puslinch entity had an unemployment rate of 2.3%, which decreased to 1.9% by January 2019, the lowest of all Canadian cities. (The national rate at the time was 5.8%.) Much of this was attributed to its numerous manufacturing facilities, including Linamar.

==History==

===Before European settlement===
First Nations peoples inhabited present-day Guelph as early as 11,000 years ago. Before colonization, the area was considered by the surrounding Indigenous communities to be a &quot;neutral&quot; zone and was inhabited by the Neutral Nation. According to the University of Guelph, &quot;the area was home to a First Nations community called the Attawandaron who lived in longhouses surrounded by fields of corn&quot;. The majority of this nation, about 4,000 people, lived in a village near what is now the Badenoch area of Puslinch, near Morriston. In 1784, the British Crown purchased a tract of land, that included present-day Guelph, from the Mississauga people for approximately £1,180.

===Founding of Guelph===
John Galt, the first Superintendent of the Canada Company, was hired to help colonize Upper Canada. He selected Guelph as the headquarters of this British development firm. Galt was a popular Scottish poet and novelist who also designed the town to attract settlers and farmers to the surrounding countryside. His design intended the town to resemble a European city centre, complete with squares, broad main streets and narrow side streets, resulting in a variety of block sizes and shapes which are still in place today. The street plan was laid out in a radial street and grid system that branches out from downtown, a technique which was also employed in other planned towns of this era, such as Buffalo, New York.

The founding was symbolized by the felling of a tree by Galt and William &quot;Tiger&quot; Dunlop, who would be significant in the history of Goderich, Ontario, on April 23, 1827. That was St. George&#x27;s Day, the feast day of the patron saint of England.

The name &quot;Guelph&quot; comes, via the Italian &quot;Guelfo&quot;, from the Bavarian &quot;Welf&quot;. It is a reference to the House of Welf, and was chosen to honour King George IV—the reigning British monarch at the time of the city&#x27;s founding—whose family, the Hanoverians, descended from the Welfs. It is for this reason that the city has the nickname &quot;The Royal City&quot;. The directors of the Canada Company had actually wanted the city to be named Goderich, because Viscount Goderich had helped form the company, but reluctantly accepted the name Guelph.

Galt constructed what was one of the first buildings in the community to house early settlers and the Canada Company office; &quot;The Priory&quot; (built 1827–1828). was located on the banks of the Speed River near the current River Run Centre for performing arts and could house up to 100 people. The building eventually became the Canadian Pacific Railway Priory station on the Guelph Junction Railway before it was eventually torn down and removed. A historical plaque commemorates John Galt&#x27;s role with the Canada Company in populating Upper Canada&#x27;s Huron Tract, calling it &quot;the most important single attempt at settlement in Canadian history&quot;. (Galt was responsible for finding settlers for the 42,000 acre Halton Block that would become Guelph and its townships but also for the one million acre Huron Tract that stretched to Goderich, Ontario.)

By the fall of 1827, 70 houses had been built, though some were primitive. In that year, the community had hired its first police constable; the first police station would be opened in 1856 at the town hall and it was moved in 1900 to the Annex building behind the court house. Also in 1827, the first Guelph Farmers&#x27; Market was built; the Market House was located in the downtown area. Founded in 1827, James Hodgert&#x27;s brewery was managed by John Sleeman until he bought a property and opened the Silver Creek Brewery in 1851. (In 1843, there were nine breweries serving the 700 people living in Guelph.)
The first Board of Commerce also started in 1827, to stimulate economic growth; in 1866, it would be renamed the Board of Trade, and in 1919, it became the Chamber of Commerce. In order to eliminate the need for farmers to take their grain to Galt or Dundas for grinding, the Canada Company built the first grist mill; the Guelph Mill was sold to William Allen in 1832. A sawmill was erected in 1833 by Charles Julius Mickle, originally from Scotland, on the Marden Creek which runs into the Speed River; its ruin survives today. The Mickle family also built a home nearby, a year earlier. Both properties were off what is now Highway 6, an area that was Guelph Township at the time.

In 1829, the Canada Company fired Galt because of poor bookkeeping and not obeying company policies. He returned to Great Britain penniless and was imprisoned because he was unable to pay his debts. In 1831, Guelph had approximately 800 residents. For several years, the economy of the village suffered and some residents moved away; relief came in the form of wealthy immigrants from England and Ireland who arrived in 1832.

The &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 indicates that the town had a jail and court house made of cut stone, a weekly newspaper, five churches/chapels and a population of 1,240; most were from England and Scotland with a few from Ireland. In addition to many tradesmen, the community had 15 stores, seven taverns, and some industry, tanneries, breweries, distilleries and a starch factory. The Post Office was receiving mail daily.

=== 1855 to 1878 ===

Guelph was incorporated as a town in 1855 and the first mayor elected was John Smith. Despite optimism, the population growth was very slow until the Grand Trunk Railway reached it from Toronto, en route to Sarnia, in 1856; the town was also served soon thereafter by the Great Western Railway branch from Harrisburg. In 1856, the village became a town. Two years later, the population was estimated at 4,500, up from 2,000 in 1853. The first city hall, now called the Old City Hall (Guelph), was built in 1856 of Guelph stone; the building contained a market house, offices and an assembly hall. Modifications were made in 1870, 1875 and 1961. The new Guelph City Hall opened in 2009 beside the older building, which was declared a National Historic Site in 1984. The national document refers to the historic building as being &quot;in the Italian Renaissance Revival style&quot;.

Two very successful major mills operated in Guelph for many years in the 1800s. The first was Allan&#x27;s Mill, first established in 1830 on the Speed River and significantly expanded to include a distillery by the next owners, the Allan family, in the 1850s. This business was extensively damaged by fire in 1876 and ceased operation as a mill; the site was later used by manufacturing companies. (In 2019, the current John Sleeman reinstated the Spring Mill Distillery on the site which also includes a condominium apartment complex.)
The more recent business, a sawmill known as the Goldie Mill, was also on the Speed; this building was constructed in 1866 by James Goldie, replacing an earlier mill known as the Wellington Mill and later as the People&#x27;s Mill. The property, a ruin, was listed on the Canadian Register as a historic place in 2009. Goldie was a perennial Conservative candidate for the riding of Wellington South, and his son Thomas Goldie was mayor of Guelph from 1891 to 1892. The limestone Goldie mill structure was damaged by fire in 1953 and a part of it was removed in 1969; the remaining part still stands today, in Goldie Mill Park at Cardigan Street and London Road East. The ruins, owned by the Grand River Conservation Authority, were stabilized in 2019–2021 to solve a problem created by sinkholes.

The board of the Guelph General Hospital was incorporated in 1861, with James Massie as the chairman. The building was completed in 1875, at the cost of $9,869, and opened on August 16, 1875, with 12 beds, a small infectious room and a dispensary.

The Gothic Revival style Roman Catholic church on Norfolk St., called the Basilica of Our Lady Immaculate since December 8, 2014, was built between 1876 and 1888.

By 1869, the community&#x27;s manufacturing companies were served by both the Grand Trunk Railway and the Great Western Railway. The first section of the Wellington, Grey &amp; Bruce Railway, between Guelph and Elora, opened in 1870; the line would eventually run as far as Southampton, Ontario, with stations in communities such as Palmerston, Harriston, Listowel and Wingham. The company was not very successful, and never did reach Owen Sound as planned, partly because of stiff competition from the Northern Railway of Canada as well as the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway. By the mid-1870s, the Wellington, Grey &amp; Bruce Railway was in financial trouble; it eventually became part of the Grand Trunk system, and later, the Canadian National Railway.

By January 1871, some residents of the town had access to gas, provided by the Guelph Gas Company via pipes, initially to about 100 homes. Electricity would not become commonly available until the early 1900s, from the Guelph Light and Heat Commission.

An 1877 plan to start the Guelph Street Railway, using horse-drawn vehicles to deliver freight and passengers within Guelph, never came to fruition.

A poor house with a farm, The Wellington County House of Industry and Refuge, opened in December 1877 in a rural area near Guelph; many orphans from Guelph were admitted. The building still stands, as the Wellington County Museum and Archives.

===After 1878===

Guelph was incorporated as a city in 1879 with a Special Act of the Ontario legislature. At this time, Guelph became politically separated from Wellington County and was no longer represented on the Wellington County Council. At separation, the population was about 10,000. During the inauguration, Mayor George Howard first used the term &quot;Royal City&quot;. The only &quot;royals&quot; to actually visit were John Campbell, the Marquis of Lorne, and his wife was Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, one of Queen Victoria&#x27;s daughters.

Construction of the Church of Our Lady Immaculate, known as the Basilica of Our Lady Immaculate since late 2014, was already underway but would not be completed until 1883. (The twin towers were not added until 1926.)

A few years later, George Sleeman Sr. founded an electric radial railway, the Guelph Railway Company, an important part of the history of Guelph Transit. Only five miles of track had been laid by 1895, but the line was extended in 1902; the radial railway eventually reached Toronto, as the Ontario Hydro Electric Railways - Guelph District (owned by Ontario Hydro). In addition to carrying passengers, the cars carted coal to heat the Ontario Agricultural College.

By 1886, telephones were quite common in the city. An April news article described the situation as follows. &quot;Telephones are rapidly being introduced into private homes, where they prove a great convenience. Ladies order their groceries, consult their medical advisers, call their husbands home from the club and gossip with their friends by telephone.&quot;

In 1903 the City purchased the Guelph Light &amp; Power Company, and four years later created the Board of Light and Heat Commissioners. Guelph was one of 13 municipalities that helped to create the provincial entity that became Ontario Hydro.

The Communist Party of Canada began as an illegal organization in a barn behind a farmhouse on Metcalfe Street in Guelph on 1921.

Guelph was the home of North America&#x27;s first cable TV system. Fredrick T. Metcalf created MacLean Hunter Television (now part of Rogers Communications) and their first broadcast was Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Coronation in 1953. Other news-making items include the fact that the jockstrap was invented here, in 1922, by the Guelph Elastic Hosiery Company and that the man who invented five pin bowling in 1909, Tom Ryan, was originally from Guelph. Other noteworthy items: the city&#x27;s covered bridge (now part of a walking trail), built by the Timber Framers&#x27; Guild in 1992, is one of only two of its type in Ontario, using wooden pins to hold it together. Note too that the Yukon Gold potato was first bred at the University of Guelph in 1966; it became available on the market in 1981.

Guelph&#x27;s police force had Canada&#x27;s first municipal motorcycle patrol. Chief Ted Lamb brought back an army motorcycle he used during the First World War. Motorcycles were faster and more efficient than walking.

Guelph has several buildings on the National Historic Sites of Canada register: the Basilica of Our Lady Immaculate, McCrae House and Old City Hall. The city is home to the University of Guelph, established in 1964, and Sleeman Breweries Ltd. The Ontario Agricultural College (OAC), the oldest part of the University of Guelph, began in 1874 as an associate agricultural college of the University of Toronto. According to Maclean&#x27;s, the current University of Guelph, founded in 1964, &quot;grew out of three founding colleges: the Ontario Agricultural College (1874), the Ontario Veterinary College (1862) and the Macdonald Institute (1903)&quot;. Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute (GCVI), established in the 1840s, is one of the province&#x27;s oldest high schools. The Former Canadian National Railways (VIA Rail/GO Transit) Station at 79 Carden Street was listed in 1992.

In 2017, Scientology Canada announced it would move its Canadian headquarters to Guelph. Some residents protested the plan. The facility was opened in the autumn of the year at 40 Baker Street.

A redevelopment plan for Downtown Guelph had been discussed by Council since 2007 and was finalized as the 2018 Baker District redevelopment project. The intent is to transform the Baker St. parking lot and properties fronting Wyndham Street&#x27;s north end into a mixed-use development, with urban intensification. Both residential and commercial buildings will be included. The final cost was estimated at between $315 million and $369 million. When finished, this area will include a new library, commercial, institutional and office space as well as an underground parking lot. The private enterprise partner for the project is Ottawa-based Windmill Development Group; there was also discussion about an additional partnership with Conestoga College and the YMCA. Actual construction was not expected to start until 2023. Before that date, up to $7.5 million will be spent to acquire the rest of the land that will be required.

In October 2018, the Ontario Energy Board approved the merger of Guelph Hydro and Alectra Utilities Corporation. After the merger was completed in January 2019, the city received a 4.63 per cent stake in Alectra and a one-time dividend of $18.5 million; afterwards, annual dividends would be received. The city has one permanent seat on the company&#x27;s Board.

==Geography==

===Topography and water courses===
Downtown Guelph is situated above the confluence of the Speed River and the Eramosa River, which have numerous tributaries. The Speed River enters from the north and the Eramosa River from the east; the two rivers meet below downtown and continue southwest, where they merge with the Grand River (Ontario). There are also many creeks and smaller rivers creating large tracts of densely forested ravines, and providing ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. The city is built on several drumlins and buried waterways, the most notable being an underground creek flowing below the Albion Hotel, once the source of water used to brew beer. Guelph is the largest Canadian city to rely almost entirely on groundwater for its drinking supply, which is sourced from two main aquifers.

===Climate===
This region of Ontario has cold winters and warm, humid summers, falling into the Köppen climate classification Dfb zone (humid continental), with moderately high rainfall and snowfall. It is generally a couple of degrees cooler than lower elevation regions on the Great Lakes shorelines, especially so in winter, the exception being on some spring afternoons when the lack of an onshore breeze boosts temperatures well above those found lakeside.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Guelph was on August 6, 1918, and July 13, 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on January 25, 1884.

==Economy==
The city of Guelph&#x27;s diversified economy helped Guelph obtain the country&#x27;s lowest unemployment rate at 4.2 per cent in 2011 and at 3.9 per cent in February 2016. The great diversity in the types of employers is a significant factor too; the city is not dependent on a single industry. The workforce participation rate of 72% was the best in Canada in December 2015 according to BMO senior economist Robert Kavcic. The job growth of more than 9 per cent at the same time was also of great value to the community. At the time, the BMO economist also rated Guelph as the top city in Canada for those looking for work. Over subsequent months, the rate increased steadily and the jobless rate was at a more typical 5.9% by October 2017, compared to 5.1% in Kitchener-Waterloo. The rate in June 2018 had decreased to 4.5%. By December 2018, StatsCan was indicating an unemployment rate of only 2.3%, down from 4% in November, and the lowest in Canada at that time.

The overall economy of the Guelph &quot;region&quot; (including the city and the townships of Guelph/Eramosa and Puslinch, Ontario) grew at an average of 3.5% per year over the previous five years and was expected to be 2.1% in 2019 and also in 2020 according to the Conference Board of Canada&#x27;s August 2019 report. Guelph&#x27;s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 3.6% per cent in 2018, the highest among medium-sized cities in Canada. &quot;Although economic growth is poised to moderate in 2019, Guelph will maintain its place as one of Canada’s economic growth leaders,&quot; the report predicted.

===Manufacturing and education sectors===
Manufacturing is the leading sector of the economy of the city with the most significant sector being auto parts manufacturing. The Conference Board of Canada&#x27;s August 2019 report stated that the Guelph region&#x27;s manufacturing was experiencing significant growth, averaging 5.9% over the past five years and expected to be 4.2% in 2019.

Linamar is the city&#x27;s leader in this sector, with 22 manufacturing plants. The company has received government funding for expansion that would create additional jobs, most recently in 2015 ($101 million) and in 2018 ($99 million). The latter would create 1,500 additional jobs and maintain 8,000 others in the Canadian operation.

According to research completed by the City of Guelph in 2010, fabricated metal product manufacturing accounted for 26.1% of the types of industries, followed by machinery manufacturing for 12.8% and miscellaneous manufacturing for 10.4%. The city&#x27;s Economic Development Strategy identified life science, agri-food and biotechnology firms, environmental management and technology companies as growth industries on which to focus economic development activities.

The city also touts the importance of advanced manufacturing which is its largest employer. The roughly 360 businesses of this type employ approximately 14,755 people (roughly 25% of Guelph&#x27;s labour force). The category includes &quot;high precision manufacturing and auto parts assembly to plastic injection moulding machines manufacturing and automation devices. This enables advanced manufacturing to be a strong driver of the local economy.&quot;

The second largest industry is Educational services, accounting for 11.3%.

===Other sectors===
Guelph is very attractive to the agri-food and biotechnology market sector, according to the city. It was ranked as the top cluster in Ontario and one of the top two in Canada. This sector includes over 90 companies in Guelph-Wellington, employing approximately 6,500 people.

The City encourages movie and television filming. Parts of several productions have been filmed here, including &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1985), &quot;American Gods&quot; (released in 2017), &quot;11.22.63&quot; (2016) with James Franco, &quot;Total Recall&quot; (2012), &quot;Dream House&quot; (2011), &quot;The Heretics&quot; (2017), &quot;Dead Rush&quot; (2016) and episodes of &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; (2013 and 2015).

===Guelph Innovation District===
As part of the plan to increase development, City Council voted in late 2017 to buy south of York Road owned by the Provincial government, including part of the property of the former Wellington Detention Centre. After the acquisition, the city would seek one or more developers to buy the property. The land actually purchased was only 23% of the long-term plan for development in the entire site bounded by Watson Parkway South, the south border of the city and Victoria Road South.

The city decided in late 2018 not to purchase the additional land for economic reasons. In 2019, the remaining 362 acres of Ontario government land was listed for sale by the province.

===Employment data===
According to the Bank of Montreal&#x27;s fourth quarter 2018 report, Guelph was the leading city in Canada in terms of job growth and low unemployment. In January 2019, the city had the lowest unemployment rate in Canada.

The 2016 Census indicated a labour force of nearly 76,000, of which about 55% said they worked full-time all year. At the time the data was gathered, 4,610 persons indicated they were unemployed. The top five occupations in terms of the number so employed were Sales and service (16,195), Education, law and social, community and government services (10,205), Business, finance and administration (10,150), Trades, transport and equipment operators and related occupations (9,170) and manufacturing and utilities (8,205).

The City of Guelph&#x27;s published 2016 data was sorting occupations in a different manner. In that report, Professional, Scientific and Technical jobs employed 39,141, Advanced Manufacturing employed 20,735, Retail and Service employed 11,345, Agri-Innovation employed 11,345, Culture and entertainment employed 7,711 and that Distribution, warehousing and wholesale employed 5,909.

The largest private enterprise employers in Guelph (2016) included:

*Linamar Corporation
*Cargill Meat Solutions
*Polycon Industries
*The Co-operators
*Guelph Manufacturing Group Inc.
*Blount Canada Ltd.

The Cooperators was one of the Platinum Winners in Canada&#x27;s Best Employers 2017 report; the company has been on this list for 14 years.

The largest public sector employers (2016) included:

*Upper Grand District School Board
*University of Guelph
*City of Guelph
*Wellington Catholic District School Board
*Guelph General Hospital
*Homewood Health Centre

The university&#x27;s staffing fell into three categories in 2015: there were 2,600 regular full-time faculty and staff, 1,890 temporary (full-time and part-time) and 3,690 student employees. The university was among Canada&#x27;s Best Employers in 2016 according to Forbes magazine, making the top 20 in the list.

Two Guelph companies were among the 2018 winners of the Waterloo Area&#x27;s Top Employers competition. According to the report, Reid&#x27;s Heritage Group of Companies, a home builder with 212 full-time employees, &quot;supports employees who are new mothers with maternity leave top-up payments ... [provides] flexible work hours, helps employees balance work and their personal commitments with up to 10 paid personal days ... and offers referral bonuses [for staff hires].&quot; Sleeman Breweries Limited, with 991 full-timers, offers &quot;generous tuition subsidies ... opportunities for the next generation to gain meaningful experience through summer employment and co-op placements ... retirement planning assistance and phased-in work options&quot; as well as bonuses for salaried staff and profit-sharing for those who are unionized.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Guelph had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Guelph CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Guelph was the third fastest-growing city in Ontario, with a 5-year growth of 8.3% from 2011 to 2016. According to the Ontario Places to Grow plan, Guelph&#x27;s population is projected to be about 144,500 by the year 2021 and 175,000 by 2031. The actual number of residents varies throughout the year because of variations in the University of Guelph student population.

=== Ethnicity ===
Approximately 73.1% of residents were European Canadians in 2021, whereas 25.3% were visible minorities and 1.6% were Indigenous. The largest visible minority groups in Guelph were South Asian (7.4%), Black (4.2%), Chinese (3.0%), Filipino (2.7%), Southeast Asian (2.2%), Latin American (1.4%), West Asian (1.4%) and Arab (1.2%).

The 2021 Census indicated that 12,210 Italian Canadians lived in Guelph. Many Italians from the south of Italy, particularly from San Giorgio Morgeto, had immigrated to the area in the early 1900s, and also in later years. Historically, however, Guelph&#x27;s population has been principally British in origin, with 92% in 1880 and 87% in 1921.

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

=== Language ===
The most common mother tongue in 2021 was English; spoken by 74.5% of the population, followed by Chinese languages (2.3%), Punjabi (1.5%), Italian (1.3%), Vietnamese (1.2%), Tagalog (1.2%), Spanish (1.2%), and French (1.1%). 2.7% of residents claimed both English and a non-official language as their first language.

=== Religion ===
In 2021, 49.7% of Guelph residents were Christians, down from 61.8% in 2011. 23.9% of residents were Catholics, 13.7% were Protestants, 7.3% were Christians of unspecified denomination, and 2.0% were Christian Orthodox. All other denominations of Christianity and Christian-related traditions accounted for 2.8%. 38.7% of the population stated no religion, up from 30.3% in 2011. All other religions and spiritual traditions combined accounted for 13.6% of the population. The largest non-Christian religions were Islam (4.5%), Hinduism (2.7%), Sikhism (1.5%) and Buddhism (1.5%)

==Crime==
The national average for the crime severity index was 70.96 per 100,000 people in 2016 while Guelph&#x27;s was much lower at 55 per 100,000 people according to a study published by Maclean&#x27;s. In this report, Guelph was at about the middle of the statistics, with the worst community, North Battleford, Saskatchewan, at 353 per 100,000 people and nearby Kitchener-Waterloo at 61. More specific data was also provided:

* Violent crime severity index: 49 per 100,000 people compared to 75.25 for the national index.
* Homicide rate: The city had only one homicide in 2016 for a rate of 0.76 per 100,000 people, compared to the national average of 1.68.
* Assault rate: Guelph was at 181.87 versus the national average of 370
* Sexual assault rate: This aspect was quite high with 64.22 per 100,000 people compared to the national rate of 56.6. 
* Robbery rate: Guelph had 21.91 per 100,000 people, much lower than the national average of 60.9.
* Fraud: This aspect has increased notably since 1996; it was at 260.67 per 100,000 people in 2016, versus the national rate of 299.05.
* Drug offences: The city is well below the national average in all categories. 
* Youth Criminal Justice Act offences: The rate was 8.31 per 100,000 in Guelph, substantially lower than the national average of 16.74.

The 2017 Index showed a 15% increase to 64 per 100,000 people, still well below the national index. Much of the increase was in property crime and sexual assaults. Reporting of the latter type of crimes was up by up 42.7%. This may not indicate the actual increase in the number of sexual assault incidents, as theorized by Chief of Police Jeff DeRuyter. He told a reporter that &quot;We are seeing an increase in sexual assault reporting, and that’s a positive, because we’ve always believed the reporting of sexual assault was under-reported.&quot;

As of January 2019, the Chief of Police is former RCMP inspector Gordon Cobey, who replaced Jeff DeRuyter who retired after 35 years of service with the Guelph Police Service. DeRuyter had been Chief since 2015, when he replaced Bryan Larkin who went on to head the Waterloo Regional Police Service.

===Facilities for incarceration===
The Wellington County Jail (in Late Gothic Revival Style) and the Governor&#x27;s Residence (in Georgian style) at 74 Woolwich Street were built in 1911; they were designated by the city for &quot;historic and architectural value&quot; and as a National Historic Site in 1983. The property is now an Ontario Court of Justice.

Guelph was home to a major correctional institution from 1911 until 2001, originally the Ontario Reformatory with subsequent names including Wellington Detention Centre and, after 1972, Guelph Correctional Centre. The first inmates had been transferred to the Guelph reformatory from Toronto&#x27;s Central Prison when it closed in 1915. By 1910, however, a prison farm beside the Eramosa River had begun receiving prisoners. The farm inmates constructed a concrete bridge, a spur line to the CPR and a wooden trestle bridge. The official opening of the farm was September 25, 1911. By 1912, the various buildings on the site housed 300; the correctional operations on the site were fully operational by 1914. Between 1911 and 1915, prisoners had built the Administration building, the cell blocks, ponds and waterways, dry stone walls, stairs, gates, bridges and terraced gardens. By 1916, this was the largest correctional facility in Ontario, housing 660.

During World War I, the property served as the Guelph Military Convalescent Hospital a convalescent hospital for over 900 veterans, from 1917. The prisoners returned in January 1921.

The farm and Reformatory were used to teach inmates useful skills, including agriculture, dry cleaning, metalworking, and other trades. By the late 1940s the facility produced food for all of Ontario&#x27;s prisons, and also made blankets, wood and metal products; there was a stone quarry stone on site. By 1962 the prison farm accommodated a dairy, piggery, horses, cattle and vegetable farming. The farm area eventually included barns, a woolen mill, abattoir, tailor shop, laundry, bakery, metal shop, broom shop and other facilities. The prison abattoir was eventually sold off and became the privately owned company, later known as Better Beef (purchased by Cargill Canada in 2005), a massive meat processing plant. 
In 2001, the Ministry of Correctional Services closed the entire facility; the remaining inmates were transferred to larger jails. Afterwards, the property was used for some film shoots and for training emergency personnel. In December 2017, City Council voted to buy for subsequent sale to developers, including the area that was then the Turf Grass research building and the jail farm, the so-called York District Land. The actual penal buildings and the land around them were not included in the plan.

In June 2019, 328.6 acres of the land, including 100 acres of natural area, still owned by the province, went on sale. The City of Guelph had not bought the site for the planned Guelph Innovation District, as it had initially considered doing, because of the potential financial risk. A rough estimate in 2017 by the city had suggested that the value of the Detention Centre site was roughly $60 million. The property for sale included the Wellington Detention Centre lands and the nearby Turfgrass Institute but not the buildings or land immediately around the former penal institution.

==Education==
Four school boards operate in the city. The Upper Grand District School Board (UGDSB) administers all of Wellington County, as well as adjacent Dufferin County, while the Wellington Catholic District School Board (WCDSB) administers Catholic education in Wellington County, including Guelph. The Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud offers French First language education for students with parents who had elementary and secondary education in French at École Saint-René-Goupil. The Conseil scolaire Viamonde, with similar entrance requirements, operates the École élémentaire L&#x27;Odyssée. Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir operates the École élémentaire catholique Saint-René-Goupil.

There are also numerous private schools in Guelph: Cornerstone Canadian Reformed Christian School, Resurrection Christian Academy, Guelph Community Christian School, Guelph Montessori School, Trillium Waldorf School, Wellington Hall Academy, and Wellington Montessori School, Echo Montessori. An International Baccalaureate Program is available at Guelph C.V.I and Bishop Macdonell C.H.S. Sacred Heart C.S. offers the IB Primary Years Program.

===Secondary schools===
All of Guelph&#x27;s secondary schools belong to either the Upper Grand District School Board or the Wellington Catholic District School Board. The following is a list of all secondary schools in Guelph:

Public (Upper Grand District School Board):
*Centennial C.V.I.
*College Heights C.V.I.
*Guelph C.V.I.
*John F. Ross C.V.I.

Catholic (Wellington Catholic District School Board):
*Our Lady of Lourdes C.H.S.
*Saint James C.H.S.
*Bishop Macdonell C.H.S.
*St. John Bosco High School
In January 2018, The Upper Grand District School Board announced new plans to build a secondary school northwest of the Victoria Road at Arkell Road intersection. The project is a part of Ontario&#x27;s Ministry of Education&#x27;s plan to build 30 new schools across the province and renovate 40 others. The new secondary school is expected to provide relief for the overpopulated Centennial C.V.I. (currently 40% overcapacity). The school is designed to accommodate 900 students and will cost the government $25.5 million. The school is expected to be complete by 2022.

===Post-secondary institutions===
*University of Guelph, (with approximately 25,300 students) is one of Canada&#x27;s top comprehensive universities, and home to the Ontario Agricultural College and the Ontario Veterinary College. 
*Conestoga College operates a small campus in Guelph but in late 2019, the college advised the news media that a major expansion was planned. &quot;Within five or six years, we will have at least 5,000 students there ... [with] full-service programming,&quot; said College President John Tibbits. At the time, the Guelph campus had approximately 1,000 students.

===Public library system===

Although a private library, run by the Farmers and Mechanics Institute, existed since 1832, a public library did not open in Guelph until 1882, when the &quot;Free Libraries Act&quot; allowed municipalities to operate libraries. After occupying premises near City Hall, it moved into an Andrew Carnegie-funded building in 1905. The neo-classical (Beaux Art) structure, had been designed in 1902 by W. Frye Colwill. The collection of the Farmers and Mechanics Institute library was contributed to the new library.

The current main library building of the Guelph Public Library, on Norfolk St. was opened in 1965. Guelph is served by a growing library system composed of a main library located in the downtown core, five branches and a Bookmobile. With a membership of over 85,000, the Guelph Public Library system&#x27;s goals include preserving and indexing public materials relating to the history of Guelph. Although no formal program has been developed, the library acquires municipal records of archival value from the City of Guelph.

A new library location has been discussed since 2018 as part of the redeveloped area downtown, known as the Baker District. This project was approved as part of the 2021 budget and as of July 2021 the library board was reviewing architectural designs.

===Museums===
The City of Guelph operates Guelph Museums, including the Guelph Civic Museum which showcases the city&#x27;s history with exhibits, an interactive gallery and special events; this facility has some 30,000 artifacts. Since 1983 when the city took over this facility, the Civic Museum has also operated McCrae House, the birthplace of Lieutenant-Colonel John McCrae (1872–1918), author of In Flanders Fields. The Museum also arranged for the restoration and placement of Locomotive 6167, a 1940s steam engine, which was located at the Guelph Central Station, but was moved to John Galt Park in November 2020 in order to make room at the station for future expansion of train service.

==Infrastructure==
===Medical facilities===
The city currently has one hospital, Guelph General, which is rated as one of the safest in Canada in terms of the hospital standardized mortality ratio; the lower the better. Guelph&#x27;s facility had a score of 78 in 2017, notably better than the national average of 91. By comparison, Cambridge Memorial Hospital had a score of 95. St. Joseph&#x27;s Health Centre was previously a hospital, but is now a 240-bed long-term care home with a 91-bed specialty unit for complex continuing, rehabilitation and palliative care. Various outpatient services are also provided at this facility.

Another major facility, Homewood Health Centre offers treatment for mental health and addiction issues. The facility was founded in 1883 by the Homewood Retreat Association of Guelph as &quot;a private asylum for the Insane and an Asylum for Inebriates&quot; on a 19-acre property which included the Donald Guthrie house. The first patients were admitted in December of that year.

Homewood grew to a 312-bed mental and behavioural health facility and also formed a partnership with R.B. Schlegel Holdings Inc.to operate Oakwood Retirement Communities Inc., a long-term care facility.

===Transportation===
====Bus====

Guelph Transit provides local transportation around the city. On June 20, 2007, Guelph Transit launched a web-based system known as &quot;Next Bus&quot;. Intercity connections by GO Transit are made at the Guelph Central Station and University of Guelph.

====Rail====

Guelph was the first municipality in Canada to have its own federally chartered railway, the Guelph Junction Railway. This link to the CPR is still municipally owned.

Built in 1911, the Guelph Central Station (still in use), was constructed by the Grand Trunk Railway which had arrived in Guelph in 1856; years later, it was taken over by the Canadian National Railway. It is a classic example of early 20th Century Canadian railway station design and has been designated as a heritage structure under the &quot;Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act&quot;. The Romanesque Revival building, with its Italianate tower, has been listed on the Canadian Register since 2006 and was formally recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s Historic Places in November 1992. A renovation project in 2016-2017 provided various benefits, including repairs to maintain and restore heritage aspects.

There had also been passenger stations in Guelph that were built by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The first CPR station, from the 1800s, was the Priory House station, converted from the first house in Guelph. It stood opposite the current Priory Square and was eventually dismantled. Its replacement, located between Cardigan Street and the Speed River, was a brick building erected in 1911. After this brick building was no longer used as a rail station, it was converted for other purposes; eventually it was moved to the Galt area of Cambridge, Ontario.

====Highways====

*Highway 401 to Toronto and London.
*Highway 7 to Kitchener and Acton. The MTO has commenced construction of the Hanlon link to Kitchener, Ontario, a controlled-access highway running parallel to the existing Highway 7 from the Hanlon Expressway to Kitchener.
*Highway 6 to Hamilton and Owen Sound. This highway is known as the Hanlon Expressway for most of its length inside the city.

==Government==

===Municipal===
The city is a single-tier municipality governed by a mayor-council system. The structure of the municipal government is stipulated by the Ontario &quot;Municipal Act&quot; of 2001. There are currently 12 councillors and a mayor, with two councillors representing each of the six wards. The mayor and members of the city council serve four-year terms without term limits, with the next election scheduled for October 2022. Prior to the 2006 election, the mayor and city councillors served three-year terms.

In 2018, incumbent Mayor Cam Guthrie was re-elected with 66.6% of the vote.

===Provincial===


As of the 2018 election, Guelph occupies a single provincial riding of the same name, and is currently represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by Mike Schreiner, the current leader of Ontario Green Party.

===Federal===

Guelph also occupies a federal riding of the same name. The member of Parliament is Lloyd Longfield of the Liberal Party of Canada.

==Culture==

===Historic sites===
*Downtown Guelph: Several downtown streets are lined with Victorian era buildings now well over a century old. Many of Guelph&#x27;s historically designated properties are in or near the downtown area. The old City Hall on Carden St., built between 1856 and 1857 and a National Historic Site, is an example of mid-19th century Renaissance Revival architecture. The building, as well as its Annex built , are also historically designated by the province. Other historically designated buildings in the area include the Winter Fair Building, the County Jail and Governor&#x27;s Residence and the Guelph Armoury. The Old Quebec Street Mall was a street built in the 1800s that was enclosed and covered; that work was completed in 1984 and the street has become an indoor shopping mall.

*The Guelph Civic Museum has been located on &quot;Catholic Hill&quot; (Norfolk St. and Cork St.) adjacent to the Basilica of Our Lady Immaculate since 2012, moving to this location from a nationally designated historic site at 6 Dublin St. South. The museum has a collection of pictures, films and other antique materials related to the historical development of the City of Guelph.
*Among the oldest of the city&#x27;s neighbourhoods, settled by affluent citizens, the St. George&#x27;s Park area features heritage homes and mansions in the highest part of Guelph. Much of the city&#x27;s elite lived on the hill running up Grange Street and many of the homes have been renovated.
* The Exhibition Park neighbourhood, containing the oldest park in Guelph, is an area that was settled in the 1870s and still contains many Victorian style heritage homes.
* The Brooklyn and College Hill area south of the Speed River is the city&#x27;s only district that was designated under the Ontario Heritage Act.
*St. Patrick&#x27;s Ward (The Ward) with many old buildings, originally contained both manufacturing facilities and modest homes. Many newcomers from Europe, particularly Italy, settled here after 1850.
*Allan&#x27;s Mill

* Heffernan Street Footbridge: Spanning the Speed River behind St. George&#x27;s Anglican Church, this structure was built in 1913, and replaced an earlier steel bridge. The footbridge was designated a heritage site and was restored/reconstructed in 1991 to more closely resemble the original design
*Goldie Mill ruins: Once owned by the Goldie family, an important name in the early Waterloo Region, the mill was operated from 1866 until 1953 when a fire destroyed it. For some years, it served as a venue for outdoor public and private events but the area around the buildings was closed to the public in June 2017 due to soil contamination and sinkholes. Restoration of the ruins was underway in 2019, authorized by the owner, the Grand River Conservation Authority; the site to re-open to the public on February 18, 2021.

==Media==

===Online media===
GuelphToday.com is an online local news source in Guelph, offering the latest breaking news, weather updates, entertainment, sports and business features, obituaries and more.

===Print media===
The earliest newspaper published in Guelph was the &quot;Guelph Herald&quot;, which lasted for nine months after it was started in 1842 by Charles McDonnell. The &quot;Wellingtonian&quot; also lasted for only a short time in 1843. The next one to be published was &quot;The Advertiser&quot; in 1845. In 1847, the new &quot;Guelph Herald&quot; was established as a weekly.

Both of those publications disappeared but the city was served by a daily newspaper for 149 years until the Guelph Mercury ceased operations in January 2016 due to declining subscriptions and revenues. At the time, it was owned by Metroland Media Group which also owned the Guelph Tribune, a twice weekly publication with limited news coverage. The latter increased its reporting of local news, assumed publication of the Guelph and District Homes section and, in April 2016, took over operation of the Mercury website. At the same time, the newspaper re-branded with a new title, Guelph Mercury Tribune.

===Radio===
The city is served by two radio stations: 
*Magic 106.1, CIMJ-FM, featuring hot adult contemporary music branded as Today&#x27;s Best Mix 
*CJOY, 1460, broadcasting an oldies format and branded as Greatest Hits
Both stations have been owned by Corus Entertainment since 2000. The University of Guelph station 93.3 CFRU-FM, Campus and Community Radio, has been broadcasting since 1980, currently at 250 watts.

Radio stations from Kitchener-Waterloo and CTV Kitchener, CKCO-DT television, also provide some coverage of Guelph news. Since 2011, CKCO has not been identified by its call letters.

===Entertainment===
The Sleeman Centre is a sports and entertainment venue in Guelph. The large, modern facility allows for a variety of events such as concerts, sporting and family events, trade shows and conferences, and it is home to the local hockey team, the Guelph Storm.

Apart from it, the city has Guelph Little Theatre, Guelph Concert Theatre and River Run Centre. Theatre studios of the University of Guelph also present their productions to the public on occasions.

===Music===
From a Bell Organ factory to the opera singer Edward Johnson, Guelph has been a source of musical contribution. Today, Guelph has a thriving indie rock scene, which has spawned some of Canada&#x27;s more well-known indie bands, many of which are highlighted in the annual Kazoo Festival. Guelph is also home to the Hillside Festival, a hugely popular music festival held at nearby Guelph Lake during the summer, as well as the Guelph Jazz Festival.

Guelph is also home to the Guelph Symphony Orchestra, and two yearly classical music festivals. The Kiwanis Music Festival of Guelph showcases students from Guelph and surrounding areas, while the Guelph Musicfest offers performances by local professional classical musicians.

It is considered to be one of the most detailed descriptions of the inner workings and leadership of Nazi Germany, but is controversial because of Speer&#x27;s lack of discussion of Nazi atrocities and questions regarding his degree of awareness or involvement with them. 

At the Nuremberg Trials, Speer was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his use of prisoners in the armaments factories while Minister of Armaments. From 1946 to 1966, while serving the sentence in Spandau Prison, he penned more than 2,000 manuscript pages of personal memoirs. His first draft was written from March 1953 to 26 December 1954. After his release on 1 October 1966, he used Federal Archive documents to rework the material into his autobiography. He was aided editorially by Wolf Jobst Siedler, Ullstein and Propylaen, and Joachim Fest.

The manuscript led to two books: first &quot;Erinnerungen&quot; (&quot;Recollections&quot;) (Propyläen/Ullstein, 1969), which was translated into English and published by Macmillan in 1970 as &quot;Inside the Third Reich;&quot; then as &quot;Spandauer Tagebücher&quot; (&quot;Spandau Diaries&quot;) (Propyläen/Ullstein, 1975), which was translated into English and published by Macmillan in 1976 as &quot;&quot;.

==Summary==
&quot;Inside the Third Reich&quot; begins with an account of Speer&#x27;s childhood, followed by a description of his role as Heinrich Tessenow&#x27;s assistant at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin). Speer first heard Adolf Hitler speak during an address to the combined students and faculty of Berlin University and his institute. Speer states he became hopeful when Hitler explained how communism could be checked and Germany could recover economically. Speer joined the National Socialist Party in January 1931; he wrote &quot;I was not choosing the NSDAP, but becoming a follower of Hitler, whose magnetic force had reached out to me the first time I saw him and had not, thereafter, released me.&quot; Speer described the personalities of many Nazi officials, including Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring, Heinrich Himmler, Rudolf Hess, Martin Bormann, and, of course, Hitler himself. Speer went on to quote Hitler as telling him privately after the remilitarization of the Rhineland, &quot;We will create a great empire. All of the Germanic peoples will be included in it. It will begin in Norway and extend to northern Italy. I myself must carry this out.&quot;

The main body of the book effectively ends when Speer, by this point having joined Karl Dönitz&#x27;s government seated in Schleswig-Holstein, receives news of Hitler&#x27;s death. This is followed by an epilogue dealing with the end of the war in Europe and the resulting Nuremberg trials, in which Speer was sentenced to a 20-year prison term for his actions during the war.

===Special weapons===
Starting in April 1942, Speer became aware of the potential of German nuclear research in developing, in his words, &quot;a weapon which could annihilate whole cities.&quot; Werner Heisenberg told Speer &quot;the scientific solution had already been found and that theoretically nothing stood in the way of building such a bomb.&quot; Yet development and production would take at least two years. This led to the development of Germany&#x27;s first cyclotron. By the autumn of 1942 however, the estimated period for developing a weapon had increased to three to four years, much too long to affect the war. Instead, development turned to a &quot;uranium motor&quot;, for use in the navy&#x27;s submarines. Finally, in the summer of 1943, Speer released the 1200 tonnes of uranium stock for use in solid-core ammunition. Speer states that even if Germany concentrated all of its resources, it would have been 1947 before they could have had an atom bomb.

Speer describes &quot;Wunderwaffen&quot; such as the Me 262 project, flying wing jet planes, a remote-controlled flying bomb, a rocket plane, a rocket missile based on infrared homing, designs for a four engined jet bomber with the range to strike New York, and a torpedo based on sonar. He also cites the use of the V-2 as a terror weapon, rather than continued development of the ground-to-air defensive Waterfall rocket.

===Holocaust and slave labor===
Speer&#x27;s involvement with concentration camp prisoners as a work force came about when Hitler agreed to Himmler&#x27;s proposal they be used for the secret V-2 project. Speer&#x27;s joint undertaking with the SS leadership resulted in the creation of Mittelwerk (Central Works) for underground production of the V-2. He goes on to say that at the Nuremberg Trial he stated he &quot;had to share the total responsibility for all that had happened&quot;, and that he &quot;was inescapably contaminated morally&quot;. Finally, Speer states, &quot;Because I failed at the time, I still feel, to this day, responsible for Auschwitz in a wholly personal sense.&quot;

==Reception==
In a 23 August 1970 review published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Toland wrote that the book &quot;is not only the most significant personal German account to come out of the war but the most revealing document on the Hitler phenomenon yet written. It takes the reader inside Nazi Germany on four different levels: Hitler&#x27;s inner circle, National Socialism as a whole, the area of wartime production and the inner struggle of Albert Speer. I recommend this book without reservations. Speer&#x27;s full length portrait of Hitler has unnerving reality. The Führer emerges as neither an incompetent nor a carpet‐gnawing madman but as an evil genius of warped concepts endowed with an ineffable personal magic.&quot; A review by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; on 27 August 1970 stated, &quot;Speer&#x27;s portrayals of the Nazi leadership, of the constant intrigues and rivalries among Hitler&#x27;s entourage, and of Hitler himself, his histrionic virulence, his banality, and his peculiar magic, are engrossing and revealing.&quot;

On the other hand, in a 1973 Bryn Mawr College review, Barbara Miller Lane wrote, &quot;Scholars have observed so many gaps in his account of the operation of his ministry as to shed considerable doubt on the whole.&quot; Martin Kitchen&#x27;s 2015 biography of Speer comes to much the same conclusion.

Another kind of criticism is the claim that Speer pretended that he was unaware of the extermination camps and presented the figure of a &quot;good Nazi&quot;. This criticism is mainly presented in the documentary film &quot;Speer Goes to Hollywood&quot;, by the director Vanessa Lapa. The film presents original videos from the Nazi Germany period and conversations with Speer, in which the great deception he tried to present at the Nuremberg trials and in his book is revealed.

<doc id="178838" wikidata="Q386567" url="?curid=178838" title="Ajax, Ontario">
<text>Ajax (; 2021 population: 126,666) is a waterfront town in Durham Region in Southern Ontario, Canada, located in the eastern part of the Greater Toronto Area.

The town is named for , a Royal Navy cruiser that served in the Second World War. It is approximately east of Toronto on the shores of Lake Ontario and is bordered by the City of Pickering to the west and north, and the Town of Whitby to the east.

==History==
The indigenous peoples were active in the watersheds of the Duffins Creek and the Carruthers Creek since the Archaic period (7000-1000 BCE), although they did not build any major settlements in the area, presumably because of the poor navigability of these streams. In 1760, French Sulpician missionaries from Ganatsekwyagon reached the Duffins Creek area, but did not settle there.

After the British conquest of New France in 1760, the area became part of the Pickering Township. Mike Duffin, an Irish fur trader, is the earliest known European to have settled in the area, in the 1770s. The conversion of the main local trail into the Kingston Road in 1799 contributed to increased settlement in what is now Ajax. In the first half of the 19th century, the Pickering Village, now a neighbourhood in Ajax, evolved as the major population centre of the Township, supported by a timber and agricultural boom. In 1807, Timothy Rogers led Quaker families to settle in the area, and built saw and grist mills on the banks of the Duffins Creek. The War of 1812 increased military traffic on the Kingston Road, resulting in a better-maintained road, and leading to further development of the area.

In the mid-19th century, Audley, a smaller community, emerged as a stopover on the route to the port of Whitby. By the 20th century, much of the area of present-day Ajax had been converted into farmland. In 1926, James Tuckett of Toronto bought lakeshore farmland, and started the development of the Pickering Beach cottage community, which later became a permanent settlement.

After the start of the World War II in 1939, the Government of Canada expropriated most of the farmland in what is now southern part of Ajax, to establish the Defence Industries Limited Pickering Works munitions plant. Operated by Defence Industries Limited (DIL), the government-owned plant employed workers from different parts of Canada. The plant site, along with the residences and the facilities established for the workers, evolved into a self-contained community, whose residents called it a &quot;village&quot;. As part of a contest, the DIL employee Frank Holroyd suggested the name &quot;Ajax&quot; for the community, in honour of the British warship &quot;HMS Ajax&quot; which had fought against the powerful Nazi battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; at the Battle of the River Plate in 1939.

After the plant shut down in 1945, the site was used as a war surplus warehouse and sales outlet, a University of Toronto campus (1946-1949), and a holding camp for war refugees from Europe (1949-1953). The government mandated the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to develop the site and its surrounding area into a modern industrial town. George Finley, the CMHC manager of the area, planned new housing subdivisions, commercial centres, and industrial areas.

In 1950, Ajax was incorporated as an Improvement District, a form of local administration managed by the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s appointees. The Improvement District Board created the community&#x27;s first by-laws and hired employees for the local administration. In August 1954, as a result of a campaign by the Ajax Citizens Association, the Ontario Municipal Board declared Ajax a town, granting it full municipal status. The first town council members were elected on 11 December 1954, and assumed office on 1 January 1955. The first mayor of the town was Benjamin de Forest Bayly, better known as Pat Bayly.

In the early 1970s, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) acquired much of the land along the lakeshore. In the Pickering Beach area, several homes, a church, and a school were demolished to make way for a parkland.

On 1 January 1974, Ajax became a part of the newly formed Regional Municipality of Durham, which manages functions common to multiple municipalities in the region. The boundaries of the town of Ajax were expanded to include several areas of the former Pickering Township, including Pickering Village, Pickering Beach, and Audley.

In 1995, Ajax was the first community along the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail to erect a pedestrian-only asphalt waterfront trail. In 2018, the trail was named William Parish Waterfront Trail to honour the founding mayor of the town.

==Geography==

Ajax is bordered to the west and north by the City of Pickering, to the east by the Town of Whitby and to the south by Lake Ontario.

===Downtown Ajax===
Ajax Council and a private developer entered into an agreement in 2012 for the purchase and sale of of vacant town-owned land at the corner of Bayly Street and Harwood Avenue. Called &quot;Pat Bayly Square&quot;, it will provide residential, retail and office space, as well as a civic square and civic facility. Pat Bayly Square opened in September 2018.

==Local government==
Ajax is governed by an elected town Council consisting of a Mayor, and local Councillors representing each of the town&#x27;s three wards. In addition, three Regional Councillors each represent a ward each. The Mayor and the Regional Councillors sit on both Ajax Town Council and Durham Region Council.

The members of the council elected in the 2022 municipal election are:

Mayor: Shaun Collier

In the past, Council has sat for a three-year term, but the Ontario Legislature increased the length of municipal council terms in Ontario to four years, in 2006. In 2018, Ajax Council shifted from two regional councillors and four local councillors to three regional councillors and three local councillors.

== Demographics ==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Ajax had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to the 2021 Census, the median age is 38.4 years, around 3 years less than the national average of 41.6 years; 18.8% of the population is under 15 years of age while 13.1% are 65 and over.

According to the 2016 Census, among those 25 to 64 years old, the highest levels of education are as follows: 66.6% of people have a post-secondary certificate, diploma, or degree, 25.3% have a high school diploma or equivalency certificate, and 8.2% have no certificate, diploma, or degree.

As of 2021, the median value of dwellings in Ajax is $850,000 compared to the provincial median value of $700,496, and the national figure of $472,000.

As of 2021, 92% of Ajax&#x27;s residents are Canadian citizens, with 42% being immigrants. 8% of the population immigrated between 2011 and 2021. The main places of birth of the immigrant population are India (13%), Sri Lanka (11%), Jamaica (10%), Philippines (8%), Pakistan (8%), Guyana (6%), United Kingdom (5%), Trinidad and Tobago (4%), Afghanistan (4%), and China (3%). Among the 5010 recent immigrants, who immigrated between 2016 and 2021, 34% were from India.

=== Ethnicity ===
According to the 2021 Census, the main self-reported ethnic and cultural origins included English (12%), Indian (10%), Canadian (9%), Irish (9%), Scottish (9%), Jamaican (6%), Filipino (5%), Pakistani (5%), Sri Lankan (4%), Chinese (4%), and Tamil (4%). 65% of the town&#x27;s population comprises visible minority, with the biggest of these groups being South Asian (26.2%), Black (16.8%), Filipino (5.3%), Chinese (3%), West Asian (3%), Arab (2%), and Latin American (1.3%). 3% of the people identify as belonging to multiple visible minority groups. Those with only indigenous ancestry make up 0.23% of the population, while those with mixed indigenous and non-indigenous ancestry make up 1.03% of the population. Ajax has the highest Black population percentage of any major Canadian municipality (population above 100,000).

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2021 Census, the largest religion in Ajax is Christianity (50.83%), with Catholics making up the largest group (22.25%). The next most reported religions are Islam (14.08%) and Hinduism (11.62%). 20.77% of the population reported no religious affiliation.

=== Language ===
According to the 2021 census, English is the most commonly understood language in the town, with 97.97% of the people knowing it. It is also the most common mother tongue: 64.79% of the people consider English as their only mother tongue, plus 5.75% consider English and another language as their mother tongues. Other common languages include the following:



==Economy==

In 1945, with the closing of D.I.L., there was no industry within the town, but in 1949, Dowty Aerospace started operations in Ajax. By 1969, major employers included Volkswagen Canada, DuPont, Paintplas, Ajax Textile, AEG Bayly Engineering and many others.

Shopping was virtually non-existent in the mid-1940s, but by 1970 major shopping centres such as Ajax Plaza, Harwood Place Mall and Clover Ridge Plaza were constructed. The 1980s saw an expansion of retail shopping malls to include Discovery Bay Plaza, Transit Square, Baywood Plaza, Westney Heights Plaza and most recently the Durham Centre at Harwood Avenue and Kingston Road.

The 1970s saw the beginning of many physical changes to the face of Ajax. New subdivisions spread over vacant land in central Ajax. The early 1980s brought extensive development to the southern part of Ajax with large, upscale housing units constructed along Lake Driveway.

The recession of the early 1980s did not stop residential development in Ajax. Westney Heights started north of Highway 2 and offered home buyers low interest rate mortgages while interest rates were then at an all-time high of 18% to 20%. Development north of Highway 2 stretched from Church Street in Pickering Village to Harwood Avenue, with the Millers Creek development south of the highway down to the edge of Highway 401.

===Ajax Downs===
Ajax Downs is a casino that is located on 50 Alexander&#x27;s Crossing, near the intersection of Kingston Road and Audley Road. It has been controversial since the announcement of the Durham Live casino in 2018. The Ontario premier Doug Ford had promised to keep the Ajax Downs open after the completion of the casino. In 2022, The Durham Live casino was completed. Although it is referred to as the Pickering Casino, it lies on the border of the two small cities. This marks the first major casino operation in the Greater Toronto Area.

==Infrastructure==
===Health care===
The Ajax and Pickering General Hospital first opened in 1954 with 38 adult and children&#x27;s beds. It was expanded to 50 beds in 1958 and a major expansion to 127 beds took place in 1964. The emergency and outpatient services were expanded in 1975. The large growth of population in the Town has prompted a further expansion. Approval was granted in the fall of 1990 to further expand. In 1999, the Hospital merged with Centenary Health Centre in Scarborough to become part of the Rouge Valley Health System. Construction on a $60 million expansion began in 2007, although that has been marred by the highly controversial closure of the 3 West Mental Health ward in 2008, which was originally to be part of the expansion.

===Emergency services===
The Durham Regional Police police Ajax from a station in Pickering. Durham Region provides Ambulance/emergency medical services. Ajax Fire &amp; Emergency Services provides firefighting services from three fire stations.

===Transportation===

Ajax GO Station is served by GO Transit&#x27;s Lakeshore East line, with service from Toronto and Oshawa.

In 1973, the Town of Ajax conducted a survey of potential transit ridership in Ajax. This led to the creation of Ajax Transit with bus service beginning in 1973 under a contract with Charterways Transportation Limited, which operated service using a fleet of school buses, with heaviest ridership between the Pickering Beach area and downtown Ajax.

In the late 1970s, the town brought the operations in house and began operations on the Elm, Duffins, and Beach routes, which exist to this day. In the early 1980s, the Harwood, Westney Heights, and Village routes began service. Service on the Puckrin route began in the late 1980s.

In 2001, Ajax Transit and the neighbouring Pickering Transit were amalgamated into the Ajax Pickering Transit Authority (APTA), which operated under the joint ownership and oversight of Ajax and Pickering.

In 2006, APTA was amalgamated into Durham Region Transit along with the other municipal transit services in Durham Region.

Road transportation in Ajax is dominated by Highway 401, which runs east–west through the town, dividing it in half. Access to Highway 401 both east and west is available via Westney Road and Salem Road. Only four streets allow transportation from the north end of town to the south end of town by crossing over or under Highway 401. These streets are (from west to east) Church Street, Westney Road, Harwood Avenue and Salem Road. Lakeridge Road crosses the highway, but it is traditionally held to be the border between the towns of Ajax and Whitby. Notable streets that run parallel to the highway are (from north to south) Taunton Road, Rossland Road, Kingston Road (Highway 2) and Bayly Street. At Salem Road is where Highway 401 narrows to three lanes each way, causing a severe traffic bottleneck eastbound during rush hours and special holidays due to increased travel to Ottawa and Montreal.

The closest international airport to Ajax is Toronto Pearson International Airport, located 50 kilometres to the west in Mississauga.

==Education==

Ajax is served by the Durham District School Board and the Durham Catholic District School Board. There are five high schools and several elementary schools. Two of the high schools are Catholic schools: Notre Dame Catholic Secondary School and Archbishop Denis O&#x27;Connor Catholic High School. The other three are the public secondary schools: Ajax High School, J. Clarke Richardson Collegiate and Pickering High School.

== Culture ==

=== Music and dance ===

During 1955–1962, the Ajax Recreational Committee ran regular dances for the town&#x27;s teenagers. The Saturday night dances, called &quot;Ajax Teen Town&quot;, were held at the Ajax Community Centre, and were attended by as many as 500 teenagers at its peak. The Community Centre burnt down in 1960s, and the event attendance gradually declined, as music styles changed and as the members grew up.

For a short period beginning in the 1990s, Ajax became notable for its punk musicians, with the &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine calling it the &quot;punk-rock capital of Canada&quot; in 2003. After the success of Sum 41, record labels began looking for upcoming artists at the local shows in the Durham region. Several other bands and artists from Ajax achieved popularity, including Closet Monster, Not by Choice, Matt Brann and Jesse Colburn (members of Avril Lavigne&#x27;s back-up band). According to writer Alan Cross, punk became popular in Ajax as the local teens kept themselves busy with music, finding not much else to do in a small town. Chameleon Café (110 Dowty Road), an auto body garage converted into a music venue, became a popular spot for local bands during the mid-to-late 1990s, with hundreds of teens gathering there on weekends. According to producer Greig Nori, the popularity of Chameleon Café (which closed in 2001) and the proximity of Ajax to Toronto (where teens could attend major punk band concerts) helped the music scene in the town.

The members of the Ajax Aquatic Club, established in 1973, have included the Olympic medalists Anne Ottenbrite and Lori Melien. The Ajax Budokan Judo Club was also established in 1973, with 20 members, most of them high school students. Its members have included judokas Jessica Klimkait, Craig Weldon, Sandra Greaves, and Kevin Doherty. The Ajax Acros Gymnastic Club was formed as a feeder club in 1974, with 60 children. Lori Strong, who has won multiple medals at the Commonwealth Games, started her training at this club.

The &quot;Ajax-Pickering Rock&quot; (2003-2010) was a local box lacrosse team that played in the Ontario Lacrosse Association Senior &quot;B&quot; League during 2003–2010. In 2010, it was promoted to Senior &quot;A&quot; Major Series Lacrosse league, and played under the name &quot;Ajax Rock&quot; (2011-2012). The team faced challenges in attracting players and fan base because of competition from other teams in the Durham Region. In 2013, it moved from Ajax to the newly constructed Toronto Rock Athletic Centre (TRAC) in Oakville, and re-branded itself as &quot;Oakville Rock&quot;.

In 2022, the Ajax Pickering Minor Hockey Association was formed after the merger of the Ajax Minor Hockey (Ajax Knights), Pickering Minor Hockey (Pickering Panthers), and Ajax-Pickering Raiders; the team retains the name &quot;Raiders&quot;. &quot;Ajax Spartans&quot; Minor Baseball Association (ASMBA) is a local minor league baseball team.

Ajax Wanderers, established in 1949, is the oldest rugby union club in Ontario. Its members have included Dave Moonlight of Whitby.

Other sports clubs in the town include the Ajax Soccer Club, Ajax United, Ajax-Pickering Dolphins (football), Ajax Pickering Ringette Association, Ajax Cricket Club, Ajax Scuba Club, and Ajax Skating Club. &quot;Ajax Ice Waves&quot;, a synchronized skating team of the Ajax Skating Club, won several local competitions in Ontario in the 2010s.

<text>The Phantom Tollbooth is a children&#x27;s fantasy adventure novel written by Norton Juster, with illustrations by Jules Feiffer, first published in 1961. The story follows a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth that transports him to the once prosperous, but now troubled, Kingdom of Wisdom. Along with a dog named Tock and the Humbug, Milo goes on a quest to the Castle in the Air seeking the kingdom&#x27;s two exiled princesses, named Rhyme and Reason. As Milo learns valuable lessons, he finds a love of learning in a story full of puns and wordplay, such as exploring the literal meanings of idioms.

In 1958, Juster had received a Ford Foundation grant for a children&#x27;s book about cities. Unable to make progress on that project, he turned to writing what became &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;, his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. Jason Epstein, an editor at Random House, bought the book and published it. &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; received rave reviews and has as of 2021 sold almost five million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into a film, opera, and play, and translated into many languages.

Though the book is on its face an adventure story, a major theme is the need for a love of education; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and to L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Additionally Maurice Sendak, in his introductory &quot;An Appreciation&quot; included in editions of the book since 1996, quotes a critic as comparing &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; to Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;: &quot;As &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; is concerned with the awakening of the sluggardly spirit, &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; is concerned with the awakening of the lazy mind.&quot;

==Plot==

Milo is a boy bored by the world around him; every activity seems a waste of time. He arrives home from another boring day at school to find a mysterious package. Among its contents are a small tollbooth and a map of &quot;the Lands Beyond&quot;, illustrating the Kingdom of Wisdom (which will also guide the reader from its place on the endpapers of the book). Attached to the package is a note &quot;For Milo, who has plenty of time.&quot; Warned by an included sign to have his destination in mind, he decides without much thought to go to Dictionopolis, assuming this is a pretend game to be played on the floor of his room. He maneuvers through the tollbooth in his electric toy car and instantly finds himself driving on a road that is clearly not in his city apartment.

Milo begins with Expectations, a pleasant place where he starts on Wisdom&#x27;s road. In Expectations, he seeks directions from the Whether Man, who is full of endless talk. As Milo drives on, he daydreams and gets lost in the Doldrums, a colorless place where nothing ever happens. Milo soon joins the inhabitants, the Lethargarians, in killing time there, a pastime angrily interrupted by the arrival of Tock, a talking, oversized dog with an alarm clock on each side (a &quot;watchdog&quot;), who tells Milo that only by thinking can he get out of the Doldrums. Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and Tock joins him on his journey through Wisdom.

Milo and Tock travel to Dictionopolis, one of two capital cities of the divided Kingdom of Wisdom and home to King Azaz the Unabridged. They meet King Azaz&#x27;s cabinet officials and visit the Word Market, where the words and letters are sold that empower the world. A fight between the Spelling Bee and the blustering Humbug breaks up the market, and Milo and Tock are arrested by the very short Officer Shrift. In prison, Milo meets Faintly Macabre, the Not-so-Wicked Which (not to be confused with Witch), long in charge of which words should be used in Wisdom. She tells him how the two rulers, King Azaz and his brother, the Mathemagician, had two adopted younger sisters, Rhyme and Reason, to whom everyone came to settle disputes. All lived in harmony until the rulers disagreed with the princesses&#x27; decision that letters (championed by Azaz) and numbers (by the Mathemagician) were equally important. They banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air and, since then, the land has had neither Rhyme nor Reason.

Milo and Tock leave the dungeon. King Azaz hosts them at a banquet where the guests literally eat their words, served to them on plates. After the meal, King Azaz lets Milo and Tock talk themselves into a dangerous quest to rescue the princesses. Azaz flatters the Humbug into being their guide, and boy, dog and insect set off for the Mathemagician&#x27;s capital of Digitopolis as they must gain his approval before they can begin their quest.

Along the way, they meet such characters as Alec Bings, a little boy suspended in the air who sees through things and who will grow down until he reaches the ground. He then meets the world&#x27;s smallest giant, the world&#x27;s biggest dwarf, the world&#x27;s thinnest fat man, and the world&#x27;s fattest thin man, who turn out to just be one regular man. Milo then loses time in substituting for Chroma the Great, a conductor whose orchestra creates the colors of the world.

They meet a twelve-sided creature called the Dodecahedron, who leads them to Digitopolis. There, they meet the Mathemagician, who is still angry at Azaz and who will not give his blessing to anything that his brother has approved. Milo maneuvers him into saying he will permit the quest if the boy can show the two have concurred on anything since they banished the princesses. To the number wizard&#x27;s shock, Milo proves that the two have agreed to disagree, and the Mathemagician gives his reluctant consent.

In the Mountains of Ignorance, the journeyers contend with demons like the Terrible Trivium and the Gelatinous Giant. After overcoming obstacles and their own fears, they reach the Castle in the Air. Princesses Rhyme and Reason welcome Milo and agree to return to Wisdom. Unable to enter the castle, the demons cut it loose, letting it drift away, but Milo realizes Tock can carry them down because &#x27;time flies&#x27;. The demons pursue, but the armies of Wisdom arrive and repel them. Rhyme and Reason heal the divisions in the old Kingdom of Wisdom, Azaz and the Mathemagician are reconciled, and all enjoy a three-day celebration.

Milo says goodbye and drives back through the tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens the next day with plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, &quot;For Milo, who now knows the way.&quot; The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding direction in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for there is so much to do right where he is.

==Writing==
Architect Norton Juster was living in his hometown of Brooklyn, after three years in the Navy. In June 1960, he gained a $5,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to write a children&#x27;s book about cities. Juster argued that the young baby boomers would soon have responsibility for the cities, and many lived in the suburbs and did not know them. In his proposal, he said he wanted &quot;to stimulate and heighten perception – to help children notice and appreciate the visual world around them – to help excite them and shape their interest in an environment they will eventually reshape.&quot; Beginning with great enthusiasm, he ground to a halt with too many notes and too little progress. He took a weekend break with friends at Fire Island, and came back determined to put aside the cities book and seek inspiration in another writing project.
Juster&#x27;s guilt over his lack of progress on the cities book had led him to write pieces of stories about a little boy named Milo, which he began to develop into a book.
Juster quit his job so that he could work on the book. His imagination fired by a boy who approached him on the street and with whom he discussed the nature of infinity, Juster wanted to finish the story about &quot;a boy who asked too many questions&quot; before returning to the book on cities. Juster shared his house in Brooklyn Heights with cartoonist Jules Feiffer whose bedroom was immediately below, and who could hear him pacing in the night. Feiffer was surprised to learn that his friend&#x27;s insomnia was not caused by the cities book, but by a book about a boy. Juster showed Feiffer the draft to date and, unbidden, the artist began sketching illustrations. Feiffer knew Judy Sheftel, who put deals together in the publishing trade and was his future bride. Sheftel got Jason Epstein, an innovative editor at Random House with a deep appreciation for children&#x27;s literature, to agree to review the manuscript. Some at Random House considered the book&#x27;s vocabulary too difficult: at the time, educators advised against children&#x27;s literature containing words the target audience did not already know, fearing the unfamiliar would discourage young learners. Based on seven chapters of manuscript, plus a three-page outline of the rest of the story, Epstein bought the book.
Since Juster did the cooking for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, he had to do the drawings. Feiffer quickly realized the book would require illustrations of the type and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and although a nationally known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book to be a success and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré&#x27;s drawings as an inspiration.

It became a game, with Feiffer trying to draw things the way he wanted, and Juster trying to describe things that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.

Repeated edits altered the protagonist&#x27;s name (originally Tony), removed his parents entirely from the book, and deleted text attempting to describe how the tollbooth package had been delivered. Milo&#x27;s age was removed from the text—early drafts have him aged eight or nine—as Juster decided not to state it, lest potential readers decide they were too old to care.

==Themes==
Since no one has ever bothered to explain the importance of learning to Milo, he regards school as the biggest waste of time in his life. Juster intended that the book speak to the importance of learning to love learning. Teaching methods that might bore children, by memorization for example, are mocked in the book, as in the case of the Spelling Bee. Like the Bee, the Humbug&#x27;s insult to his fellow insect goes over Milo&#x27;s head, but possibly not the reader&#x27;s: &quot;A slavish concern for the composition of words is the sign of a bankrupt intellect.&quot; According to Mary Liston in her journal article on law in fantasy realms, &quot;&quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; concerns the difference between education and wisdom and what processes are conducive to synthesizing both, so as to encourage an attitude of engagement, alertness, and responsibility within an increasingly autonomous individual.&quot;

Another theme is the need for common sense to back up rules. Milo journeys through a land where, without Rhyme or Reason, the art of governance has been lost, leading to bizarre results. Milo repeatedly meets characters to whom words are more important than their meaning. The Whether Man, for all his talk, is unable to provide Milo with the information or guidance the boy wants, while Officer Shrift&#x27;s investigation of the overturning of the Word Market contains the forms of law, without justice. The denizens around Digitopolis are little better; the twelve-faced Dodecahedron, named for what he is, turns the logic of his naming on its head when he asks if everyone with one face is called Milo. The attitudes now displayed by the adherents of both brothers are summed up by the Dodecahedron, &quot;as long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong?&quot;

As Milo struggles with words and begins the process of making himself their master, he also has difficulty with numbers, especially when he speaks with .58 of a child, who with parents and two siblings (whom Milo does not meet) makes up an average family. Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, &quot;one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are&quot;. Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, &quot;You must never feel badly about making mistakes ... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons&quot;. An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess&#x27; &quot;memorable&quot; counsel to Milo, &quot;Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes.&quot;

Although Milo is bored with learning, that does not mean he knew nothing before his journey. He exhibits characteristics of a well-schooled child of his time; his speech is polite and peppered with &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;, and when he unexpectedly encounters the partial child, he requests pardon for staring. He can count to a thousand, though his tact in bringing up the subject in the presence of the numbers-hating King Azaz is not the best. Mindful of his mother&#x27;s admonition to eat lightly when a guest, he initially orders a light meal at the banquet, only to find the waiters bringing in insubstantial light beams. Not realizing he will be asked to eat his words, he then makes a plausible start at a speech before being interrupted by the king.
&quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; displays Milo&#x27;s growth; Leonard S. Marcus in his notes to its annotated edition writes that the boy learns to think in the abstract, pledging after his unintentional jump to Conclusions that he will not make up his mind again without a good reason. Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not. Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what it will be like to do the same. According to Liston, Milo &quot;transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities&quot;.

Even though the day is won by Milo and his fellow questers, it is a great but not a permanent victory, as he hears the kingly brothers begin to argue again as he departs. Juster has written that it was his intent to get Milo out of there as quickly as possible, and that &quot;the fight would have to be won again and again&quot;.

Milo&#x27;s trip through the lands beyond the tollbooth teaches the previously bored child to appreciate both journey and destination. This is a lesson that had been unlearned by the citizens of Wisdom, as exemplified by the described fate of the twin cities of Reality and Illusions. Although the city of Illusions never actually existed, Reality was lost as its residents concentrated on getting to their destination as quickly as possible, and, unappreciated, the city withered away, unnoticed by the busy people who still hasten along its former streets. Milo meets his trials by defining himself as different from the kingdom&#x27;s inhabitants, who either demand or accept conformity, as enforced by the kingdom&#x27;s laws, which discourage (and even outlaw) thought. Milo cannot accept such laws, beginning when, in the Doldrums, he thinks, thus violating a local ordinance and separating himself from the thoughtless inhabitants. Liston opined that because the Kingdom of Wisdom&#x27;s &quot;laws require the impossible, they contradict what it means to be fully human&quot;.

==Influences and comparisons==
&quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; contains allusions to many works, including those loved by Juster in his own upbringing. Some of Juster&#x27;s favorite books as a child, including &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer&#x27;s opposition, going so far as to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style. Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel&#x27;s love of puns, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio. According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to radio serials helped inspire &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;, as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on sidekick Jim Fairfield from &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot;. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit. As a child, Juster had synesthesia, and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. &quot;One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; [radio serial] they would say, &#x27;Here come the Injuns!&#x27; and I always had an image of engines, of train engines.&quot;
Some of the incidents in the book stem from Juster&#x27;s own past. In Digitopolis, the Numbers Mine, where gemlike numerals are dug for, recalled one of Juster&#x27;s architecture professors at the University of Pennsylvania, who compared numbers and equations to jewels. The Marx Brothers films were a staple for Juster as a child and his father would quote lengthy passages from the movies; this inspired the unending series of straight-faced puns that fills the book.

Growing up in a Jewish-American household where the parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though in his case many of his parents&#x27; hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star. The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster&#x27;s way of representing his own tendency to avoid what he should be doing in favor of a more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;. Juster drew on Feiffer&#x27;s life experiences as well; the Whether Man&#x27;s adage &quot;Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens&quot; was a favorite of the cartoonist&#x27;s mother.

Juster had not read &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; when he wrote &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;, but the two books, each about a bored child plunged into a world of absurd logic, have repeatedly been compared. According to Daniel Hahn in his 2012 article on the Juster book, &quot;Alice is clearly Milo&#x27;s closest literary kin&quot;. Milo&#x27;s conversation with the Whether Man, which leaves him no more comprehending than when he came, recalls that of Alice with the Cheshire Cat. The questions of authority (something omnipresent for a child) and of justice run through both books; the Queen of Hearts&#x27; arbitrary justice is echoed, though with less violence, by Officer Shrift. Alice&#x27;s sovereigns, representing the authority figures of Victorian childhood life, rule absolutely (though not necessarily effectively); a child of the post-World War II world, Milo journeys through a more bureaucratic realm. His quest is far more purposeful than the frustrating journey Alice experiences, and the outcome differs as well—Milo restores his kingdom while Alice overturns hers. Carroll leaves us uncertain if Alice has learned anything from her adventures, but Juster makes it clear that Milo has acquired tools he will need to find his way through life.

==Publication and reception==
&quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; was published in September 1961. Its competition among new books for the minds and hearts of children included Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;. &quot;The Bronze Bow&quot;, set in the Biblical times, was newly available, and brought Elizabeth George Speare her second Newbery Award in three years. Neither publisher nor first-time author expected many sales for &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;, but Juster was nevertheless disappointed not to find his work on store shelves. His mother, Minnie, did her part, as her son put it, &quot;terrorizing&quot; bookstore owners into displaying it.
Juster says the book was rescued from the remainders table when Emily Maxwell wrote a strong review of it in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Maxwell wrote, &quot;As &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; is concerned with the awakening of the sluggardly spirit, &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; is concerned with the awakening of the lazy mind.&quot; Hers was far from the only positive piece; children&#x27;s author Ann McGovern reviewed it for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing &quot;Norton Juster&#x27;s amazing fantasy has something wonderful for anyone old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and the pointed whimsy of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;&quot;. John Crosby wrote for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;In a world which sometimes seems to have gone mad, it is refreshing to pause and consider for a moment a book for children which contains a character called &#x27;Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.&#x27; The name of the book is &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; and it was written by a bearded elf named Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, who is the cleverest of the young neurotics&quot;. Dissenting was the &quot;Bulletin of the Center for Children&#x27;s Books&quot;, which in March 1962 deemed the book an &quot;intensive and extensive fantasy, heavily burdened with contrivance and whimsy&quot;.

In 1962, the book was published in Britain. Siriol Hugh-Jones wrote for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;&quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; is something every adult seems sure will turn into a modern &quot;Alice&quot; ... The obvious guess is that the appeal of this sort of writing is directed towards just the sort of adults who derive a perfectly grown-up pleasure from regularly rereading the &quot;Alices&quot;. As one might expect, it is illustrated by every grown-up&#x27;s favourite child-like pictures with the built-in sad sophistication, the work of Jules Feiffer.&quot; Jennifer Bourdillon reviewed it for &quot;The Listener&quot;, &quot;This is the story of an imaginary journey, a sort of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; of a little boy in his car ... One would hardly have thought from the sound of this that it would have so magnetic an appeal, but the brilliant verbal humour and the weird and wonderful characters (the Dodecahedron, the Watchdog, Faintly Macabre) make it that rare delight, a book which parents and children can share.&quot; It reached Australia in 1963; &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;&#x27; reviewer, J.E.B., deemed it memorable, causing readers to quote from it and leaf through its pages again.

==Later history, editions and adaptations==
After publication, Juster sent a copy of the book to the Ford Foundation, with an explanation of how the projected book on cities had transformed into &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;. He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and he heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years &quot;and they&#x27;ll talk to me about a whole different book, normally. But now they&#x27;ve got a lot more of the words right. A lot more of the fun kind of crazy references&quot;. He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, as in the case of the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician&#x27;s letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.
As the book became acclaimed as a modern classic, it began to be used in the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book&#x27;s readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, &quot;it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way.&quot; British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: &quot;it didn&#x27;t occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, only better.&quot; One reader, signing himself &quot;Milo&quot;, wrote to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1970, &quot;If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;, by Norton Juster. They tell you it&#x27;s a kids&#x27; book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype.&quot;

The book continued to garner positive reviews and comments. In 1998, Amanda Foreman wrote for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; of London, &quot;I want to shout about &quot;The Phantom&quot; from the rooftops. I want to stand in Waterloo and press copies into people&#x27;s hands. This is a book that should be in every home. ... Whether you are 8 or 88 Juster&#x27;s mixture of allegorical wisdom and logical whimsy will take you on a journey of the spirit. &quot;The Phantom&quot; is a &quot;mappa mundi&quot; of our hearts, proving once again that in laughter and simplicity lies the truth of life&quot;. In a 2011 article written for the book&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, Adam Gopnik wrote, &quot;The book is made magical by Juster&#x27;s and Feiffer&#x27;s gift for transforming abstract philosophical ideas into unforgettable images.&quot;

The book has been translated into many foreign languages, including Chinese, Croatian, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Thai, Turkish and three different Spanish editions: one for Spain, one for Latin America, and one for Spanish speakers in the United States. Juster stated that he did not know if the wordplay of the original carries through to the translated works. In 1969, Chuck Jones made &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; into a musical film of the same name, produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1970. Milo&#x27;s town and room were depicted in live action, with the film changing to animation beyond the tollbooth. Juster disliked the film, describing it as &quot;drivel&quot;. The classical composer Robert Xavier Rodriguez in 1987 composed &quot;A Colorful Symphony&quot; based on the work. Audiobooks of &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; have been narrated by Norman Dietz, David Hyde Pierce, and Rainn Wilson. 

In 2011, &quot;The Annotated Phantom Tollbooth&quot; was published, which includes sketches and copies of Juster&#x27;s handwritten drafts and word lists, Feiffer&#x27;s early drawings, and an introduction and annotations by Leonard S. Marcus. A fiftieth anniversary edition was also published, with appreciations by Maurice Sendak, Michael Chabon and Philip Pullman. More than three million copies have been sold of the original book in the U.S. alone. It has been adapted into a small-scale opera with music by Arnold Black, and a book by Juster and Sheldon Harnick, produced by Opera Delaware in 1995. It was then revamped into a musical that had its debut to strong reviews at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and then made a national tour.

&quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; remains acknowledged as a classic of children&#x27;s literature. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed it as one of the &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012, it was ranked number 21 among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;.

In 2017, TriStar Pictures announced that Matt Shakman would direct its upcoming &quot;live-action/hybrid&quot; film adaptation of &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;. In 2018, Carlos Saldanha replaced Shakman due to scheduling conflicts. Theodore Melfi is drafting the screenplay after Michael Vukadinovich and Phil Johnston.

In 2011, Juster stated that he felt that his book still had relevance, even though children&#x27;s lives had changed since 1961:

<text>Brotherhood of Man were a British pop group who achieved success in the 1970s with three number one hits in the UK. They won the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest with &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot;.

Created in 1969 by songwriter and record producer Tony Hiller, Brotherhood of Man was initially an umbrella title for a frequently-changing line-up of session singers. Early on, they scored a worldwide hit with the song &quot;United We Stand&quot;. By 1973 the concept had run its course and Hiller formed a definite four-member line-up consisting of Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens. This version of the group went on to score many hits around the world in the mid to late 1970s including &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby&quot;, &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot;, &quot;Angelo&quot;, &quot;Oh Boy (The Mood I&#x27;m In)&quot; and &quot;Figaro&quot;. They achieved perhaps their biggest success in their native UK with three number one singles and four top twenty albums. The group under this line-up continued into the 21st century performing shows throughout Europe. Altogether, they released 16 studio albums, with worldwide sales topping 15 million records.

==History==

=== Original line-up ===
Brotherhood of Man was formed by record producer/composer Tony Hiller in 1969, and originally featured his co-writer John Goodison (who performed as Goodison but wrote under the pseudonyms Peter Simmons and Peter Simons) with Tony Burrows, Roger Greenaway, Sue Glover and Sunny Leslie. Greenaway was also a songwriter and had co-written hits such as &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotten Hold of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Melting Pot&quot;. Burrows was a well-known session singer, performing in various line-ups on hit singles such as the No.1 hit &quot;Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)&quot; by Edison Lighthouse. The two female members, Glover and Leslie were an act in their own right, releasing singles as Sue and Sunny.

The group came together in 1969 and began recording some songs with Hiller. Their first single &quot;Love One Another&quot; failed to chart, but the follow-up &quot;United We Stand&quot; (released in January 1970) was a worldwide hit. &quot;United We Stand&quot; was heavily played on British radio, and broke into the American market. The single became a Top 20 hit in the UK, Canada, Australia and US. The song has since been used as the closing theme for television&#x27;s &quot;Brady Bunch Hour&quot; and as an anthem for various causes. Burrows left the group soon after and as a four-piece, The Brotherhood of Man followed &quot;United We Stand&quot; with another hit, &quot;Where Are You Going to My Love&quot;. The song charted in the UK, Canada, and US and has since been covered by Olivia Newton-John and The Osmonds among others. A début album &quot;United We Stand&quot; followed soon after.

Over the next two years, the group continued in varied line-ups. Goodison left the group at the beginning of 1971 and was replaced by American singer Hal Atkinson, Greenaway left soon after and was replaced by Russell Stone. They had one more minor hit in the US (1971&#x27;s &quot;Reach Out Your Hand&quot;), but experienced no further success in the UK and split after being dropped by their record company.

=== Current line-up ===
Keen to keep the established name alive, Hiller set about putting a new line up together. In 1972 he got together a trio of session singers, Martin Lee, Nicky Stevens and Lee Sheriden.

Sheriden was already known to Hiller as a songwriter and had a solo career. Lee had a solo single to his name and was a budding songwriter. Stevens had been classically trained, but had since adapted her vocals and was performing as a cabaret singer. The trio began recording together, but their first single, &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;, to be released at the end of 1972, was cancelled due to the release of the song by David Cassidy. Finally their first two singles &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; and &quot;Our World of Love&quot; were released in 1973. Neither single charted and soon after, another female vocalist was added to the line up, Sandra Stevens. Stevens (no relation to Nicky) had been performing as a big-band singer since a teenager in the late 1960s. She had sung with the Joe Loss big band and alongside Eve Graham (of The New Seekers) in club group, The Nocturnes.

Now signed to the Pye spin off label, Dawn, the quartet released their first single, &quot;When Love Catches Up on You&quot; in January 1974. It failed to chart, but the follow-up single, &quot;Lady&quot; became a hit in Europe. Encouraged by this, the group set about recording their debut album. The album &quot;Good Things Happening&quot; was released later in the year along with two more singles, but none of these found success. Before the record label folded, Brotherhood of Man released one more single in the Summer of 1975. This was the upbeat &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby&quot; and it although failed to make an impression in the UK, it became a big hit in Europe, reaching Number one in Belgium and Number two in the Netherlands as well as top 10 placings in other countries. Brotherhood of Man toured extensively in Europe, honing their stage act and harmonies, while Hiller, Sheriden and Lee worked on composing songs for their second album. Among them was a song Sheriden had largely written called &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot;.

=== Eurovision victory ===

In early 1976, Hiller was keen for Brotherhood of Man to make an impact in the UK and decided to put &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; forward to the &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; competition. This year saw a change to the contest in that, since 1964, one specific artist had performed all the songs (e.g. Cliff Richard, Olivia Newton-John, Lulu, etc.), but 1976 saw the return to the format in which any artist was eligible to enter. &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; made it to the final twelve songs and on 25 February, Brotherhood of Man took the title, beating the second placed act, Co-Co by two points. Now signed to Pye Records, &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; was released as a single in March and hit the No.1 spot two weeks before the Contest final. On 3 April, the &quot;1976 Eurovision Song Contest&quot; was staged in the Netherlands and Brotherhood of Man performed the song, dressed in red, white and black with simple choreography devised by Guy Lutman. &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; took the title with an overwhelming victory. As manager Hiller stated; 
&quot;...&quot;Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby&quot; was a hit all over Europe in &#x27;75. I firmly believe it opened the door for us a year later and helped us do well because they knew us – every weekend we&#x27;d travel to do TV spots in France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland&quot;.
The song became a major hit around the world and reached No.1 in many countries and returned the group to the US Charts. The song eventually sold six million copies worldwide and is still the highest selling Eurovision winning single ever. In the UK, it stayed at No.1 for six weeks and earned them a platinum disc. It ended up the top selling single of the year and is still one of the few UK singles to sell a million.

=== Post Eurovision success ===
The group had already recorded a second album which had been released in several countries a year previously. Following their victory, Pye released the album with &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; added. Entitled &quot;Love and Kisses,&quot; the album was a success in the UK, reaching the top twenty, as well as other countries, gaining a number 6 position in Norway for instance. Soon after this, a follow-up single was released. Eager to cash in on their success, Pye decided against releasing anything from the album, as the earlier material had been more soul-based than the pop they were now successful with. The group instead released &quot;My Sweet Rosalie&quot; – almost a carbon copy of the previous hit, although the lyrical twist was that it was about a dog, rather than a child. The song failed to chart highly, only reaching number 30 in the UK, but fared better in other countries, particularly Belgium where it made number 2. Concerned by the lack of success for the single, the record company did not release anything else in the UK for the rest of 1976, despite the fact that in Europe a new album of material was released along with singles in various countries: &quot;I Give You My Love&quot; in Germany, Spain and others and &quot;New York City&quot; in France.

Early in 1977, the group released their next single, &quot;Oh Boy (The Mood I&#x27;m In)&quot;. The song was a change to their previous hits in that it was female-led and much more in a contemporary pop style. The song was a hit in the UK, reaching the top 10 and fared well in Europe also. The album which had been released in Europe the previous year was now released in the UK with the new single added. The album, now titled &quot;Oh Boy!&quot;, did not follow their last album into the charts however.

Their progress was cemented with the release of their next single, &quot;Angelo&quot;. which was released in the Summer of 1977 and was an instant success. The song rose to Number one in the UK Charts and became one of the biggest hits of the year as well as ending up among the 50 best selling singles of the decade. The group were invited to appear at the 1977 Royal Variety Performance, where they elected to sing &quot;Angelo&quot;, rather than their then current single &quot;Highwayman&quot;. Deprived of this vital promotion, the single failed to enter the chart (although was &#x27;bubbling under&#x27; the top 50 at the time). It did however become a top 20 hit in both the Netherlands and Belgium. An accompanying album &quot;Images&quot;, similarly failed in the UK chart.

The group moved on into 1978 with the release of &quot;Figaro&quot;, which brought them back into vogue and became their third UK Number one single. In May &quot;Beautiful Lover&quot; was released became another hit, reaching the UK top twenty, and spending three months in the charts. An album was released soon after, &quot;B for Brotherhood&quot;. The record company took no chances with this album, given the failure of their previous two, and so with a TV advertising campaign, the album entered the UK Charts, eventually peaking at number 18 – their most successful album so far.

As the year drew to a close another single, &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; was released along with a greatest hits compilation,&quot; Twenty Greatest.&quot; Apart from featuring all their own hits and a smattering of album tracks and new songs, the group re-recorded both &quot;United We Stand&quot; and &quot;Where are You Going to My Love&quot; for the album. &quot;Twenty Greatest&quot; became Brotherhood of Man&#x27;s most successful album, reaching Number six in the UK Charts and spending fifteen weeks in the top 75.

=== Chart decline ===
1979 saw the group going into decline as the hits dried up. Three singles released in the first six months of the year all failed to make the charts as did their next album, &quot;Higher Than High&quot;. This was despite regular TV appearances and radio play, although the group remained popular on the live circuit.&quot;. As Pye Records were due to fold at the end of the year, one more album was released in December to fulfill their contract. The album &quot;Singing a Song&quot; was made up of unreleased songs mixed with new material, but no singles were released from the collection.

Manager Tony Hiller set up his own record company in 1980, Dazzle Records. Brotherhood of Man released the first single on the label, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t Throw Our Love Away&quot; which also did not chart, nor did the follow-up, a cover of the 1960s hit &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot;. An album was recorded but was only released in Australasia. Towards the end of the year, the group were offered a deal with Warwick Records to make an album of cover versions. Released in November, &quot;Sing 20 Number One Hits&quot; was the group&#x27;s take on 20 number one UK hits from recent years. The album was a hit, peaking at No.14 – their biggest chart success for two years. The album remained in the top 50 for two months and was awarded a gold disc for sales of over 100,000. Keen to release a follow-up, Warwick offered them a double album deal the following year. Released as a buy one get one free package, &quot;20 Disco Greats / 20 Love Songs&quot; – again, a collection of recent chart hits, came out in late 1981. This album did not match the success of the first and missed the UK Charts. Tracks from these albums appear frequently on CD releases of the group, interspersed with their own hit singles.

In early 1982, Sheriden opted to leave the group to study for a degree in music. Hiller took on 28-year-old Barry Upton, an up-and-coming songwriter. Upton was later to write hits for many artists including Sonia and Steps.

The previous year, the UK had won the Eurovision Song Contest (the first time since Brotherhood of Man) with the two-boy/two-girl pop act Bucks Fizz. Within twelve months they had chalked up three number one singles and, encouraged by their popularity, Hiller set about reviving Brotherhood of Man&#x27;s fortunes. In 1982, Brotherhood of Man signed a deal with EMI in the hope that the new pop revival would encompass them. Armed with a new single, &quot;Lightning Flash&quot;, written by Hiller, Lee, and Upton, the group were relaunched with a new contemporary image and sound. The song only reached No. 67 in the summer of 1982, but it was their first single to chart in nearly four years. A follow-up, &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;, failed to capitalise on this, but nevertheless, the group began working on a new album.

In 1983, the songwriting team of Hiller, Lee, and Upton entered a song for the &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; competition. Their composition, &quot;When the Kissing Stops&quot;, made it to the final eight, but although initially tempted, the group decided not to perform the number themselves (&quot;We all agreed it would be better to be remembered as winners, and we couldn&#x27;t bear to lose!&quot; remembers Sandra Stevens). Hiller formed a male/female trio under the name Rubic to represent the song on 24 March 1983. The group lost out to another male/female trio, Sweet Dreams, and ended up in fifth place. Despite its failure, Brotherhood of Man recorded the song and chose it as their next single. Released in the summer of 1983, alongside their new album, &quot;Lightning Flash&quot;, neither record made the UK Chart and this brought to an end their contract with EMI. &quot;When the Kissing Stops&quot; remains Brotherhood of Man&#x27;s final single release.

Brotherhood of Man continued to perform in concert throughout the UK and Europe, but less than a year later the group decided to split. This ended their twelve-year working relationship with Hiller.

=== Reformation ===
In 1985, Brotherhood of Man reunited for a one-off TV appearance and they discussed getting back together. Over the next year, and now back with Sheriden in place of Upton, the group formed their own management company and begin performing again. In late 1986, the group were back on the live circuit, but decided against attempting a chart comeback.

In 1990, Martin Lee got together with songwriters Paul Curtis and David Kane to compose a musical based on &quot;The Butterfly Children&quot; books by Angela and Pat Mills. The musical had its world premiere at the Mitchell Theatre in Glasgow, to open the 1990 Glasgow City of Culture and ran for a month and was performed by the Mitchell Theatre for Youth. Just three months later, the show transferred to the larger Kings Theatre in Glasgow and ran for two weeks. The show transferred in late 1992 to London&#x27;s West End. Brotherhood of Man recorded the songs themselves and the nineteen track collection, available on cassette only, was available to buy at the theatre. The album was never commercially released, although some tracks did make it onto tie-in cassettes to go with the books a few years later. &quot;The Butterfly Children&quot;, essentially a children&#x27;s show, featured many differing styles of music from rap to rock and country and western to the more familiar pop the group were known for. The show&#x27;s run ended after a short season, and has not been performed since.

In 1991, the group went back into the recording studio and made an album of re recorded hits and some new material with Dutch producer Eddy Ouwens. Not only was this their first recording for eight years, but it was their first without Hiller. The album remains unreleased in the UK, but was released in Spain under the title &quot;Grandes Exitos&quot; and in some other countries as &quot;The Golden Hits of Brotherhood of Man&quot;.

Throughout the nineties the group continued to perform live around the world in TV, concert and in cabaret and in 1997, they recorded another album, based on their live show. Again, the album contained re-recordings of their hits as well as cover versions that they perform in concert, such as &quot;1999&quot; by Prince and &quot;Juke Box Hero&quot; by Foreigner. The album contained one new song, the title track &quot;Greenhouse&quot;, rescued from the 1991 sessions. Like the previous album, this was never commercially released and was only available to buy at their shows.

As the 2000s dawned, the group went into semi-retirement and cut back on touring. However, in 2002, they devised a new live show based on their roots in the 1970s. Entitled &quot;The Seventies Story&quot;, the show comprised a trip through the decade, with the group performing well known songs from each year along with a narration of contemporary events. The group returned to the studio and recorded an album of the show&#x27;s songs. Again, this album was not released in shops, but was available on CD at the show&#x27;s venues. The tracks did get a general release later on however on various compilation albums. In 2004, the first Brotherhood of Man DVD was released, featuring TV performances of many of their singles.

The group continued to do occasional shows with both &quot;The Seventies Story&quot; and with their own material. They also teamed up with the current incarnation of Bucks Fizz and together they performed as a two-part show. They frequently played to sold-out houses, &quot;The Seventies Story&quot; being particularly successful in receiving good reviews.

Brotherhood of Man found themselves in demand on both the Nostalgia and Eurovision circuit. They appeared a number of times at London&#x27;s G-A-Y theatre and regularly appeared on TV both in the UK and abroad, especially around Eurovision time each year. In 2006, they appeared at the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest gala held in Denmark, where they were voted in the top 5 Eurovision songs of all time – the highest of any UK entry.

In 2009, Cherry Red Records released the first four albums by the Eurovision line up as two double CDs. This was the first time these albums were available on CD. They also got to No 29 in the UK album charts in May 2019. 

The group announced their retirement from touring on 24 December 2022, having last performed live in October 2020. However, they noted that &quot;the four of us are still together&quot; Long-time member Martin Lee died in September 2024.

<text>Aurora (2021 population: 62,057) is a town in central York Region in the Greater Toronto Area, within the Golden Horseshoe of Southern Ontario, Canada. It is located north of the City of Richmond Hill and is partially situated on the Oak Ridges Moraine. In the Canada 2021 Census, the municipal population of Aurora was the 92nd largest in Canada, compared to 95th for the 2016 Census and 97th for the 2006 Census. Aurora is twinned with Leksand, Sweden.

==History==

Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe gave the order for Yonge Street to be extended to Holland Landing in 1793, the first step toward the establishment of a community where Aurora now stands. Yonge Street opened between 1794 and 1796. In 1795, the first house in Aurora was built at Yonge Street and Catherine Avenue. The government began granting deeds to land in 1797. By 1801 there were fourteen homes.

=== Establishing a village ===
In 1804, Richard Machell became the first merchant at the crossroads of Yonge and Wellington and the hamlet soon became known as Machell&#x27;s Corners. Charles Doan was another early businessman at Machell&#x27;s Corners and became the first postmaster and later the first reeve. The post office was originally known as &quot;Whitchurch&quot;. As postmaster, he was influential in renaming the village Aurora, after the goddess Aurora from Roman mythology. Machell proposed to rename the town &quot;Match-Ville&quot;, ostensibly for the match factory in the town, but the name Aurora was more popular and ultimately chosen as the town&#x27;s name. Flour and grist mills were built around 1827. With the coming of the railway in 1853, Aurora emerged as an important centre north of Toronto. The Fleury plough works foundry opened in 1859, making agricultural implements.

The community was first known as Machell&#x27;s Corners and had only 100 residents in 1851.
The population of Aurora in 1863 was 700, and by 1869 it had grown to 1,200.

=== Becoming a town ===
The settlement was incorporated as a village in 1863 with Charles Doan as the first reeve. Records from 1885 describe Aurora as the &quot;largest village in the county&quot; an &quot;enterprising and stirring business community&quot; with several factories and mills, five churches, a school house with 210 students, and two weekly newspapers. The population in 1881 was 1540. The population reached 2,107 by 1888.

By the turn of the century, many industries moved out of Aurora and as a result, the town suffered a downturn and reverted to its agricultural roots. From then on the town experienced slow growth until the rise of suburbia after the end of the Second World War, when Aurora was rejuvenated and experienced a boom in development due to its proximity to Toronto.

Aurora was the childhood home of Lester B. Pearson, Prime Minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968, when his father, Rev. Edwin Pearson, was the Methodist minister.

=== Recent developments ===
For most of the 20th century, development in Aurora centred primarily around its historic downtown core at Yonge and Wellington Streets, bounded on the east by Industrial Parkway. Starting in the early 21st century, the town has expanded eastward beyond Industrial Parkway to Highway 404. Since then, Aurora has grown considerably, with new developments stretching the built boundary of the town to be contiguous with Newmarket in the north and Highway 404 in the east. New developments have pulled the economic focal point within the town increasingly eastward towards Highway 404. Aurora&#x27;s downtown has suffered economically over the years as a result of recent developments.

Aurora is noted for preserving its historical built form in the older parts of town and in 2008 was awarded The Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership. In 2009, the town received the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Ontario Heritage Award for Community Leadership in heritage conservation and promotion. Northeast Old Aurora was designated in 2006 as a provincial Heritage Conservation District.

On April 8, 2010, the town reopened the historic and fully renovated Church Street School as the Aurora Cultural Centre.

==Growth and urban planning==
A large area in the southeastern part of Aurora is designated as protected under Ontario Government&#x27;s Greenbelt legislation which enforces limits on growth in designated Green Belt locations. The majority of future growth will be split between currently undeveloped portions Aurora along Leslie Street and St John&#x27;s sideroad, along with intensification within existing built-up areas. The stretch of Yonge Street within Aurora has been designated as a &quot;Regional Corridor&quot; by York Region and will likely accommodate the majority of intensification, with upgrades to the Viva bus rapid transit system being anticipated.

The portion of the 2C Lands between Highway 404 and Leslie Street has been designated as a significant employment zone by the region and the town. Construction has commenced on the lands, which are anticipated to provide approximately 6,000 jobs at full build-out. The town&#x27;s Official Plan includes for major office growth to occur in the area. Residential growth is restricted to the west side of Leslie Street, which has seen several new developments of detached homes, townhouses, and condominium apartments in the late 2010s.

The Regional Municipality of York has proposed the area surrounding Aurora GO Station to be designated as a Major Transit Station Area (MTSA). Under this designation, the area would undergo intensification and experience an increased density of jobs and residents.

As of 2020, the Town of Aurora is conducting a review and update of its Official Plan.

===The Aurora Promenade===
As part of the town&#x27;s 2010 Official Plan review, a sub-committee of Council developed a plan in 2010, called the Aurora Promenade, that sets out new and redevelopment for the coming years. More than 30 public meetings, open-houses and workshops were held to create the plan. It is anticipated that 2,930 additional residents will live along the Yonge and Wellington Street corridors, close to new major transportation systems being implemented by Viva. The study was expected to stimulate new and redevelopment along both corridors in the coming years and to reinvigorate the downtown core.

The plan may be subject to change pending the 2020 Official Plan Review.

<text>François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, PSS (), more commonly known as François Fénelon (6 August 1651 – 7 January 1715), was a French Catholic archbishop, theologian, poet and writer. Today, he is remembered mostly as the author of &quot;The Adventures of Telemachus&quot;, first published in 1699. He was a member of the Sulpician Fathers. 

==Childhood and education, 1651–75==
Fénelon was born on 6 August 1651 at the Château de Fénelon, in Sainte-Mondane, Périgord, Aquitaine, in the Dordogne river valley, the second of the three children of Pons de Salignac, Comte de La Mothe-Fénelon by his wife Louise de La Cropte. Reduced to the status of &quot;impecunious old nobility&quot; by François&#x27; time, the La Mothe-Fénelons had produced leaders in both Church and state. His uncle Francois currently served as bishop of nearby Sarlat, a see in which fifteen generations of the Fénelon family had filled the episcopal chair. &quot;In fact, so many members of the family occupied the position that it had begun to be considered as practically a familial apanage to which the Salignac-Fénelon had a right as seigneurs of the locality&quot; 

Fénelon&#x27;s early education was provided in the Château de Fénelon by private tutors, who gave him a thorough grounding in the language and literature of the Greek and Latin classics. In 1663, at age 12, he was sent to the University of Cahors, where he studied rhetoric and philosophy under the influence of the Jesuit &quot;ratio studiorum&quot;. When the young man expressed interest in a career in the church, his uncle, the Marquis Antoine de Fénelon (a friend of Jean-Jacques Olier and Vincent de Paul) arranged for him to study at the Collège du Plessis in Paris, whose theology students followed the same curriculum as the theology students at the Sorbonne. While there, he became friends with Antoine de Noailles, who later became a cardinal and the Archbishop of Paris. Fénelon demonstrated so much talent at the Collège du Plessis that at age 15, he was asked to give a public sermon. About 1672 (i.e. around the time he was 21 years old), Fénelon&#x27;s uncle managed to get him enrolled in the Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice, the Sulpician seminary in Paris.

==Early years as a priest, 1675–85==
Around 1675 (when he would have been 24), Fénelon was ordained as a priest. He initially dreamed of becoming a missionary to the East, but instead, and at the instigation of friends, he preached in Sulpician parishes and performed routine pastoral work as his reputation for eloquence began to grow.

In early 1679, François Harlay de Champvallon, Archbishop of Paris, selected Fénelon as director of &quot;Nouvelles-Catholiques&quot;, a community in Paris for young Huguenot girls, who had been removed from their families and were about to join the Church of Rome. In 1687, he published a pedagogical work, &quot;Traité de l&#x27;éducation des filles&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Education of Girls&quot;), which brought him much attention, not only in France, but abroad as well.

From 1681 to 1695, Fénelon was prior of the fortified monastery at Carennac.

==Missionary to the Huguenots, 1686–87==
During this period, Fénelon had become friends with his future rival Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet. When Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the Church began a campaign to send the greatest orators in the country into the regions of France with the highest concentration of Huguenots to persuade them of the errors of Protestantism. Upon Bossuet&#x27;s suggestion, Fénelon was included in this group, alongside such oratorical greats as Louis Bourdaloue and Esprit Fléchier.

He spent the next three years in the Saintonge region of France preaching to Protestants. He persuaded the king to remove troops from the region and tried to avoid outright displays of religious oppression. But, in the end, he was willing to resort to force to make Protestants listen to his message. He believed that &quot;to be obliged to do good is always an advantage and that heretics and schismatics, when forced to apply their minds to the consideration of truth, eventually lay aside their erroneous beliefs, whereas they would never have examined these matters had not authority constrained them.&quot;

==Important friends, 1687–89==

During this period, Fénelon assisted Bossuet during his lectures on the Bible at Versailles. It was probably at Bossuet&#x27;s urging that he now composed his &quot;Réfutation du système de Malebranche sur la nature et sur la grâce&quot;, a work in which he attacked Nicolas Malebranche&#x27;s views on optimism, the creation, and the Incarnation. This work was not published until 1820, long after Fénelon&#x27;s death.

Fénelon also became friendly with the Duc de Beauvilliers and the Duc de Chevreuse, who were married to the daughters of Louis XIV&#x27;s minister of finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert. He wrote a &quot;Treatise on the Existence of God&quot;.

In 1688, Fénelon first met his cousin Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte Guyon, usually known simply as Madame Guyon. At that time, she was well received in the social circle of the Beauvilliers and Chevreuses. Fénelon was deeply impressed by her piety and actively discipled her. He would later become a devotee and defend her brand of Quietism.

==Royal tutor, 1689–97==

In 1689, Louis XIV named Fénelon&#x27;s friend the Duc de Beauvilliers as governor of the royal grandchildren. Upon Beauvilliers&#x27; recommendation, Fénelon was named the tutor of the Dauphin&#x27;s eldest son, the seven-year-old Duke of Burgundy, who was second in line for the throne. This brought him a good deal of influence at court.

As tutor, Fénelon was charged with guiding the character formation of a future King of France. He wrote several important works specifically to guide his young charge. These include his &quot;Fables&quot; and his &quot;Dialogues des Morts&quot;.

But by far the most lasting of his works that Fénelon composed for the duke was his &quot;Les Aventures de Télémaque&quot; [The Adventures of Telemachus, Son of Ulysses], written in 1693–94. On its surface, &quot;The Adventures of Telemachus&quot; was a novel about Ulysses&#x27; son Telemachus. On another level, it became a biting attack on the divine right absolute monarchy which was the dominant ideology of Louis XIV&#x27;s France. In sharp contrast to Bossuet, who, when tutor to the Dauphin, had written &quot;Politique tirée de l&#x27;Écriture sainte&quot; which affirmed the divine foundations of absolute monarchy while also exhorting the future king to use restraint and wisdom in exercising his absolute power, Fénelon went so far as to write &quot;Good kings are rare and the generality of monarchs bad&quot;.

French literary historian Jean-Claude Bonnet calls &quot;Télémaque&quot; &quot;the true key to the museum of the eighteenth-century imagination&quot;. One of the most popular works of the century, it became an immediate best seller both in France and abroad, going through many editions and translated into every European language and even Latin verse (first in Berlin in 1743, then in Paris by Étienne Viel [1737-87]). It inspired numerous imitations, such as the Abbé Jean Terrasson&#x27;s novel &quot;Life of Sethos&quot; (1731), which in turn inspired Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Magic Flute&quot;. It also more directly supplied the plot for Mozart&#x27;s opera, &quot;Idomeneo&quot; (1781). Scenes from &quot;Télémaque&quot; appeared in wallpaper. The American president Andrew Jackson wallpapered the entrance hall to his slave plantation, The Hermitage, in Tennessee, with scenes from Telemachus on the Island of Calypso.

Most believed Fénelon&#x27;s tutorship resulted in a dramatic improvement in the young duke&#x27;s behaviour. Even the memoirist Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, who generally disliked Fénelon, admitted that when Fénelon became tutor, the duke was a spoiled, violent child; when Fénelon left him, the duke had learned the lessons of self-control as well as being thoroughly impressed with a sense of his future duties. &quot;Telemachus&quot; is therefore widely seen as the most thorough exposition of the brand of reformism in the Beauvilliers-Chevreuse circle, which hoped that following Louis XIV&#x27;s death, his brand of autocracy could be replaced by a monarchy less centralized and less absolute, and with a greater role for aristocrats such as Beauvilliers and Chevreuse.

In 1693, Fénelon was elected to Seat 34 of the Académie française.

In 1694, the king named Fénelon Abbot of Saint-Valery, a lucrative post worth 14,000 livres a year.

The early- to mid-1690s are significant since it was during this period that Mme de Maintenon (quasi-morganatic wife of Louis XIV since roughly 1684) began to regularly consult Fénelon on matters of conscience. Also, since Fénelon had a reputation as an expert on educating girls, she sought his advice on the house of Saint-Cyr which she was founding for girls.

In February 1696, the king nominated Fénelon to become the Archbishop of Cambrai while at the same time asking him to remain in his position as tutor to the duke of Burgundy. Fénelon accepted, and he was consecrated by his old friend Bossuet in August.

==Quietist controversy, 1697–99==

As already noted, Fénelon had met Madam Guyon in 1688 and became an admirer of her work.

In 1697, following a visit by Mme Guyon to Mme de Maintenon&#x27;s school at Saint-Cyr, Paul Godet des Marais, Bishop of Chartres (Saint-Cyr was located within his diocese) expressed concerns about Mme Guyon&#x27;s orthodoxy to Mme de Maintenon. The bishop noted that Mme Guyon&#x27;s opinions bore striking similarities to Miguel de Molinos&#x27; Quietism, which Pope Innocent XI condemned in 1687. Mme de Maintenon responded by requesting an ecclesiastical commission to examine Mme Guyon&#x27;s orthodoxy: the commission consisted of two of Fénelon&#x27;s old friends, Bossuet and de Noailles, as well as the head of the Sulpician order of which Fénelon was a member. The commission sat at Issy and, after six months of deliberations, delivered its opinion in the &quot;Articles d&#x27;Issy&quot;, 34 articles which briefly condemned certain of Mme Guyon&#x27;s opinions, as well as set forth a brief exposition of the Catholic view of prayer. Both Fénelon and the Bishop of Chartres signed the articles, as did all three commission members. Mme Guyon immediately submitted to the decision.

At Issy, the commission asked Bossuet to follow up the Articles with an exposition. Bossuet thus proceeded to write &quot;Instructions sur les états d&#x27;oraison&quot;, which he submitted to the commission members, as well as to the Bishop of Chartres and Fénelon, requesting their signatures before its publication. Fénelon refused to sign, arguing that Mme Guyon had already admitted her mistakes and there was no point in further condemning her. Furthermore, Fénelon disagreed with Bossuet&#x27;s interpretation of the Articles d&#x27;Issy, as he wrote in &quot;Explication des Maximes des Saints&quot; (a work often regarded as his masterpiece - English: &quot;Maxims of the Saints&quot;). Fénelon interpreted the Articles d&#x27;Issy in a way much more sympathetic to the Quietist viewpoint than Bossuet proposed.

Louis XIV responded to the controversy by chastising Bossuet for not warning him earlier of Fénelon&#x27;s opinions and ordered Bossuet, de Noailles, and the Bishop of Chartres to respond to the &quot;Maximes des Saints&quot;. Shocked that his grandson&#x27;s tutors held such views, the king removed Fénelon from his post as royal tutor and ordered Fénelon to remain within the boundaries of the archdiocese of Cambrai.

This unleashed two years of pamphlet warfare as the two sides traded opinions. On 12 March 1699, the Inquisition formally condemned the &quot;Maximes des Saints&quot;, with Pope Innocent XII listing 23 specific propositions as unorthodox.

Fénelon immediately declared that he submitted to the pope&#x27;s authority and set aside his own opinion. With this, the Quietist matter was dropped.

However, that same year, &quot;The Adventures of Telemachus&quot; was published. This book also enraged Louis XIV, for it appeared to question his regime&#x27;s very foundations. Thus, even after Fénelon abjured his Quietist views, the king refused to revoke his order forbidding Fénelon from leaving his archdiocese.

==Later years==

As Archbishop of Cambrai, Fénelon spent most of his time in the archiepiscopal palace, but also spent several months of each year visiting churches and other institutions within his archdiocese. He preached in his cathedral on festival days, and took an especial interest in seminary training and in examining candidates for the priesthood prior to their ordination.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, Spanish troops encamped in his archdiocese (an area France had only recently captured from Spain), but they never interfered with the exercise of his archiepiscopal duties. Warfare, however, produced refugees, and Fénelon opened his palace to refugees fleeing the ongoing conflict.

During these latter years, Fénelon wrote a series of anti-Jansenist works. The impetus was the publication of the &quot;Cas de Conscience&quot;, which revived the old Jansenist distinction between questions of law and questions of fact, and argued that though the church had the right to condemn certain opinions as heretical, it did not have the right to oblige one to believe that these opinions were actually contained in Cornelius Jansen&#x27;s &quot;Augustinus&quot;. The treatises, sermons, and pastoral letters Fénelon wrote in response occupy seven volumes in his collected works. Fénelon particularly condemned Pasquier Quesnel&#x27;s &quot;Réflexions morales sur le Nouveau Testament&quot;. His writings contributed to the tide of scholarly opinion which led to Pope Clement XI&#x27;s 1713 bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot;, condemning Quesnel&#x27;s opinions.

Although confined to the Cambrai archdiocese in his later years, Fénelon continued to act as a spiritual director for Mme de Maintenon, as well as the ducs de Chevreuse and de Beauvilliers, the duke of Burgundy, and other prominent individuals.

Fénelon&#x27;s later years were blighted by the deaths of many of his close friends. Shortly before his death, he asked Louis XIV to replace him with a man opposed to Jansenism and loyal to the Sulpician order. He died on 7 January 1715.

==Fénelon as reformer and defender of human rights==
Fénelon wrote about the dangers of power in government. Historian Paul Hazard remarks that the author posed hard questions for his fictional hero Telemachus to put to Idomeneus, King of Salente: 
Fénelon defended universal human rights, and the unity of humankind. He wrote:

He also wrote of women&#x27;s education as a means against heresy.

== Fénelon&#x27;s &quot;Inner Life&quot; and Tozer ==
Rev. A. W. Tozer highly praises François Fénelon&#x27;s &quot;Inner Life (Christian Perfection)&quot;, valuing its profound spiritual insights and practical guidance for deepening one’s relationship with God. Tozer regards it as an essential read for those earnest in pursuing a devout Christian life, emphasizing its timeless significance.

Tozer cherished Fénelon&#x27;s &quot;Christian Perfection&quot; deeply, never lending it out, and considered it an unparalleled aid to spiritual life.

==Later Reference by William Godwin==

William Godwin referenced Fenelon in book II, chapter II of his Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, as an example of man whose life and continued authorship of important works was so valuable to society at large, that if his palace was in flames and someone was in a position to rescue either Fenelon or his valet (some editions say &quot;chambermaid&quot;), we should rescue Fenelon, even if the servant was our close relative.

<text>Op art, short for optical art, is a style of visual art that uses optical illusions.

Op artworks are abstract, with many better-known pieces created in black and white. Typically, they give the viewer the impression of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibrating patterns, or swelling or warping.

== History ==

Illusionism, focused on the perception of extended space within a flat picture, is found from the earliest points of art history. However, the antecedents of op art, in terms of graphic effects and concern for exotic optical illusions, can be traced back to Neo-Impressionism, Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism, and Dada. The Divisionists, a group of Neo-Impressionist painters, attempted to increase the apparent luminosity of their paintings through recourse to optics and optical illusions. László Moholy-Nagy produced photographic op art and taught the subject in the Bauhaus; one of his lessons consisted of making his students produce holes in cards and then photographing them.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine coined the term &quot;op art&quot; in 1964, in response to Julian Stanczak&#x27;s show &quot;Optical Paintings at the Martha Jackson Gallery&quot;, to mean a form of abstract art (specifically non-objective art) that uses optical illusions. Works now described as &quot;op art&quot; had been produced for several years before &quot;Time&#x27;s&quot; 1964 article. For instance, Victor Vasarely&#x27;s painting &quot;Zebras&quot; (1938) is made up entirely of curvilinear black and white stripes not contained by contour lines. Consequently, the stripes appear to both meld into and burst forth from the surrounding background. Also, the early black and white &quot;dazzle&quot; panels that John McHale installed at the &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot; exhibit in 1956 and his &quot;Pandora&quot; series at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1962 demonstrate proto-op art tendencies. Martin Gardner featured op art and its relation to mathematics in his July 1965 Mathematical Games column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;. In Italy, Franco Grignani, who originally trained as an architect, became a leading force of graphic design where op art or kinetic art was central. His Woolmark logo (launched in Britain in 1964) is probably the most famous of all his designs.


Op art perhaps more closely derives from the constructivist practices of the Bauhaus. This German school, founded by Walter Gropius, stressed the relationship of form and function within a framework of analysis and rationality. Students learned to focus on the overall design or entire composition to present unified works. Op art also stems from &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; and anamorphosis. Links with psychological research have also been made, particularly with Gestalt theory and psychophysiology. When the Bauhaus was forced to close in 1933, many of its instructors fled to the United States. There, the movement took root in Chicago and eventually at the Black Mountain College in Asheville, North Carolina, where Anni and Josef Albers eventually taught.

Op artists thus managed to exploit various phenomena,&quot; writes Frank Popper, &quot;the after-image and consecutive movement; line interference; the effect of dazzle; ambiguous figures and reversible perspective; successive colour contrasts and chromatic vibration; and in three-dimensional works different viewpoints and the superimposition of elements in space.

In 1955, for the exhibition &quot;Mouvements&quot; at the Denise René gallery in Paris, Victor Vasarely and Pontus Hulten promoted in their &quot;Yellow manifesto&quot; some new kinetic expressions based on optical and luminous phenomenon as well as painting illusionism. The expression &quot;kinetic art&quot; in this modern form first appeared at the Museum für Gestaltung of Zürich in 1960, and found its major developments in the 1960s. In most European countries, it generally includes the form of optical art that mainly makes use of optical illusions, like op art, as well as art based on movement represented by Yacov Agam, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Jesús Rafael Soto, Gregorio Vardanega or Nicolas Schöffer. From 1961 to 1968, the &quot;Groupe de Recherche d&#x27;Art Visuel&quot; (GRAV) founded by François Morellet, Julio Le Parc, Francisco Sobrino, Horacio Garcia Rossi, Yvaral, Joël Stein and Vera Molnár was a collective group of opto-kinetic artists that—according to its 1963 manifesto—appealed to the direct participation of the public with an influence on its behavior, notably through the use of interactive labyrinths.

Some members of the group Nouvelle tendance (1961–1965) in Europe also were engaged in op art as Almir Mavignier and Gerhard von Graevenitz, mainly with their serigraphics. They studied optical illusions. The term &quot;op&quot; irritated many of the artists labeled under it, specifically including Albers and Stanczak. They had discussed upon the birth of the term a better label, namely &quot;perceptual art&quot;. From 1964, Arnold Schmidt (Arnold Alfred Schmidt) had several solo exhibitions of his large, black and white shaped optical paintings exhibited at the Terrain Gallery in New York.

=== &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot; ===
In 1965, between February 23 and April 25, an exhibition called &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot;, created by William C. Seitz, was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and toured to St. Louis, Seattle, Pasadena, and Baltimore. The works shown were wide-ranging, encompassing the minimalism of Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, the smooth plasticity of Alexander Liberman, the collaborative efforts of the Anonima group, alongside the well-known Wojciech Fangor, Victor Vasarely, Julian Stanczak, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Wen-Ying Tsai, Bridget Riley and Getulio Alviani. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships.

The exhibition was a success with the public (visitor attendance was over 180,000), but less so with the critics. Critics dismissed op art as portraying nothing more than &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot;, or tricks that fool the eye. Regardless, the public&#x27;s acceptance increased, and op art images were used in a number of commercial contexts. One of Brian de Palma&#x27;s early works was a documentary film on the exhibition.

== Method of operation ==

=== Black-and-white and the figure-ground relationship ===
Op art is a perceptual experience related to how vision functions. It is a dynamic visual art that stems from a discordant figure-ground relationship that puts the two planes—foreground and background—in a tense and contradictory juxtaposition. Artists create op art in two primary ways. The first, best known method, is to create effects through pattern and line. Often these paintings are black and white, or shades of gray (&quot;grisaille&quot;)—as in Bridget Riley&#x27;s early paintings such as &quot;Current&quot; (1964), on the cover of &quot;The Responsive Eye&quot; catalog. Here, black and white wavy lines are close to one another on the canvas surface, creating a volatile figure-ground relationship. Getulio Alviani used aluminum surfaces, which he treated to create light patterns that change as the watcher moves (vibrating texture surfaces). Another reaction that occurs is that the lines create after-images of certain colors due to how the retina receives and processes light. As Goethe demonstrates in his treatise &quot;Theory of Colours&quot;, at the edge where light and dark meet, color arises because lightness and darkness are the two central properties in the creation of color.

=== Color ===
Beginning in 1965 Bridget Riley began to produce color-based op art; however, other artists, such as Julian Stanczak and Richard Anuszkiewicz, were always interested in making color the primary focus of their work. Josef Albers taught these two primary practitioners of the &quot;Color Function&quot; school at Yale in the 1950s. Often, colorist work is dominated by the same concerns of figure-ground movement, but they have the added element of contrasting colors that produce different effects on the eye. For instance, in Anuszkiewicz&#x27;s &quot;temple&quot; paintings, the juxtaposition of two highly contrasting colors provokes a sense of depth in illusionistic three-dimensional space so that it appears as if the architectural shape is invading the viewer&#x27;s space.

==Similarities with other art styles==
Although op art is a unique style, it has similarities with styles such as abstract expressionism (color field painting). Although color field painting does not give us illusions, similarities can still be found. We can see that both of these styles are minimalist, only a few colors prevail, and no object or plot is shown. These styles can cause us emotion, since there is no clear plot, the human mind itself imagines and interprets it in its own way. Cold colors are usually associated with sadness, while warm colors are associated with joy. Also, op art and color field painting are characterized by the fact that the image is aesthetic and orderly.

<text>Barrie is a city in Central Ontario, Canada, about north of Toronto. The city is within Simcoe County and located along the shores of Kempenfelt Bay. Although it is physically in the county, Barrie is politically independent. The city is part of the extended urban area in southern Ontario known as the Greater Golden Horseshoe. As of the 2021 census, the city&#x27;s population was 147,829, while the census metropolitan area had a population of 212,667 residents.

The area was first settled during the War of 1812 as a supply depot for British forces, and Barrie was named after Sir Robert Barrie. The city has grown significantly in recent decades due to the emergence of the technology industry. It is connected to the Greater Golden Horseshoe by Ontario Highway 400 and GO Transit. Significant sectors of the city&#x27;s diversified economy include education, healthcare, information technology and manufacturing.

== History ==

=== Before 1900 ===
Barrie is situated on the traditional land of the Wendat and Anishinaabeg peoples. At its inception, Barrie was an establishment of houses and warehouses at the foot of the Nine Mile Portage from Kempenfelt Bay to Fort Willow, an indigenous transportation route that existed centuries before Europeans arrived in Simcoe County. The portage linked Kempenfelt Bay through Willow Creek, connecting Lake Simcoe to the Nottawasaga River which flows into Georgian Bay off Lake Huron.

Barrie played an integral role in the War of 1812. During the war, the city became a supply depot for British forces and, in addition, the Nine Mile Portage was adopted by the British military as a key piece of their supply line which provided a strategic path for communication, personnel and vital supplies and equipment to and from Fort Willow and Georgian Bay/Lake Huron. Today, the Nine Mile Portage is marked by signs along roads in Barrie and in Springwater Township. The scenic path from Memorial Square to Fort Willow is accessible to visitors year-round.

In 1815, Treaty 16 was signed, which transferred 250,000 acres of land from the Chippewa people to the colonial government. In 1818, Treaty 18 was signed, which resulted in the surrender of an additional 1,592,000 acres of land. The British supply depot would continue to prove useful for portaging Europeans and settlers making their way to northern and western Upper Canada.

The city was named in 1833 after Sir Robert Barrie, who was in charge of the naval forces in Canada and frequently commanded forces through the city and along the Nine Mile Portage. Barrie was also the final destination for a branch of the Underground Railroad. In the mid-19th century, this network of secret routes allowed many American slaves to enter Barrie and the surrounding area. This contributed to the development (and name) of nearby Shanty Bay. In 1846, the population of Barrie was roughly 500, mostly from England, Ireland and Scotland. A private school, three churches, a brick courthouse and a limestone jail, (built in 1842), were in operation. Local businesses included three taverns, six stores, three tanneries, a wagon maker, a bakery, a cabinet maker and six shoemakers, as well as a bank.

By 1869, Barrie became the county seat of Simcoe County, flourishing with a population of over 3,000 people. With this population increase came the establishment of prominent businesses and landmarks. In 1850, Edward Marks had established the Barrie Hotel (now called the Queen&#x27;s Hotel), the oldest continuously running hotel in Barrie, James and Joseph Anderton established the Anderton Brewery in 1869, which would go on to be one of Barrie&#x27;s largest employers for years, and Edmund Lally opened one of the Canadian Bank of Commerce&#x27;s original branches in Barrie in 1867. A line of the Northern Railway was opened in 1853, connecting Barrie with Toronto and several other municipalities in Simcoe County and Muskoka. The Hamilton and North-Western Railway (H&amp;NW) also ran through Barrie, and the two railways would eventually reorganize into the Northern and North Western Railway in June 1879. Allandale Station was the primary train station serving Barrie at the time. The Grand Trunk Railway purchased the original Northern Railway in 1888, and the line serving Barrie would become a branch of the Canadian National Railway (CNR). Throughout the latter of the 19th century, steamships ran from Barrie to the Muskoka Territory, Orillia and other communities and stages were taking passengers to Penetanguishene.

The period of 1870 to 1890 defined Barrie&#x27;s downtown development with a series of raging fires that sequentially destroyed multiple landmarks, giving rise to the moniker that Barrie was &quot;among the best burning towns in Canada.&quot; Many local businesses like breweries, tanneries and sawmills depended on fire to operate, endangering the ramshackle assortment of wooden homes and buildings that made up the city centre.

One of the most destructive fires came in mid-1875 when the entire section north of Dunlop Street to Collier Street, bounded by Clapperton and Owen Streets, was reduced to ash, destroying around 20 local businesses.

=== 20th century ===
In the next century, the modern streets and buildings of Barrie began to take form in a massive rebuilding process. Other landmarks to eventually burn down over the years include the Queen&#x27;s Hotel (1915) and two of Barrie&#x27;s largest and most prominent companies; the Sevigny Carriage Shop and the Anderton Brewery in 1916.

During the First World War, residents of Barrie helped to construct Canadian Forces Base Borden (CFB Borden) as a means of additional support and to serve as a major training centre of Canadian Expeditionary Force battalions. The base would open on July 11, 1916, and since then has become the largest Canadian Forces Base in Canada, playing an important role through the remainder of the war by training some 350,000 troops for deployment in Europe. During World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy named a .

On September 7, 1977, a private aircraft, owned by Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd, dropped altitude to in dense fog and struck CKVR&#x27;s transmitter tower, killing all five people aboard the plane and destroying the tower and antenna. The station&#x27;s auxiliary tower was also destroyed with damage to the main studio building. CKVR returned to the air on September 19 at a reduced power of 40,000 watts until a new tower was built in 1978.

The 1980s and 1990s was a period of substantial growth for Barrie, with the population tripling in the span of 25 years. In 1981, the city had a population of 38,423; in 2006, Barrie had 128,430 residents living within city limits. The first larger scale developments would begin during this time, including high-density waterfront condos and the new Barrie City Hall which started construction in October 1985.

On May 31, 1985, Barrie was struck by a devastating F4 tornado that killed eight people. Over 600 homes were damaged or destroyed by the tornado, and of those roughly one-third were rendered uninhabitable. About 155 people were also injured during the storm, and the tornado remains today one of the most destructive and violent in Canadian history. The tornado caused $150 million (1985 CAD), equivalent to $326 million CAD as of 2022.

Between June 12–13, 1987, a sculpture called &quot;Spirit Catcher&quot; by Ron Baird was moved to Barrie from Vancouver, British Columbia, where it had been exhibited as part of Expo &#x27;86. The sculpture was permanently erected at the foot of Maple Avenue on the shore of Kempenfelt Bay and has since become a major Barrie landmark and tourist attraction. However, with the re-development along the waterfront and Lakeshore Drive, the city is considering moving the Spirit Catcher to a gravel outcropping at the foot of Bayfield Street.

=== 21st century ===
On January 12, 2004, the former Molsons plant was found to be home to an illegal marijuana grow-op housing an estimated 30,000 marijuana plants with an estimated street value of $30 million (~$ in ); at the time, it was the largest marijuana grow-op bust in Canada&#x27;s history.

Barrie&#x27;s Park Place (formerly Molson Park) was chosen to host Live 8 Canada on July 2, 2005. The overall success of the concert helped support a plan to convert the former Molson Park lands into a commercial district. Construction of Park Place began in 2008 but was temporarily interrupted by the Great Recession and an Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) appeal that proposed a rezoning of the Park Place lands that was initially denied by the City of Barrie. Construction resumed in 2010.

An explosion in the Royal Thai restaurant, housed in the landmark Wellington Hotel at the &quot;Five Points&quot; intersection in downtown Barrie, occurred at 11:20pm on December 6, 2007. The fire quickly spread to several neighbouring buildings and firefighters battled the blaze well into the following morning, requiring assistance from other Simcoe County fire services. Officials estimated the damages to be in the millions. The 100-year-old Wellington Hotel building collapsed later in the morning. On February 17, 2008, two people were charged in connection with the fire after the Ontario Fire Marshal&#x27;s office concluded the explosion and subsequent fire were the result of arson.

In 2013, Barrie was twinned with the English town of Harrogate as a result of Sir Robert Barrie&#x27;s close connection to it.

On July 15, 2021, a tornado struck neighbourhoods in south Barrie, leaving several people injured and causing serious damage to property. Environment Canada categorized it as an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale.

== Geography ==
Barrie is located in the central portion of southern Ontario, approximately north of Toronto within the Greater Golden Horseshoe subregion. It is accessible via Highways 26, 400 and 11 and has convenient access to Highway 401, the Highway 407 Express Toll Route and to neighbouring Toronto. Toronto Pearson International Airport is less than a one-hour drive from Barrie via Highway 400.

Barrie&#x27;s historic downtown area is situated in a distinct curved or wrapped valley, surrounding the western edge of Kempenfelt Bay. Terrain is generally flat near the city&#x27;s centre. Moving up the valley slopes toward the city&#x27;s north and south ends, the terrain can be rather steep in some areas. The minimum elevation of Barrie is around the shores of Kempenfelt Bay and the maximum elevation is northwest of the Lake Simcoe Regional Airport.

Barrie falls into Plant Hardiness Zone 5b. The city does not have any major rivers within its limits but does have numerous creeks and streams, most of which empty into Kempenfelt Bay.

=== Expansion ===
Barrie has been designated an Urban Growth Centre by the province of Ontario. As one of the fastest growing cities in Canada, this designation aims to mitigate urban sprawl and concentrate higher-density development in areas specified by the City of Barrie. Its population growth can be attributed to the emergence of the city as a bedroom community for Toronto. In 1991, Barrie had a population of 62,728 and by 2017, Barrie had an estimated population of 147,000. By 2031, the city&#x27;s population is expected to exceed 200,000 people. To plan for the continued growth of the city, Barrie successfully annexed of land from the neighbouring Town of Innisfil to the south and southeast on January 1, 2010. The annexation comprised lands south beyond McKay Road and west of the 10th Sideroad, and as far south as Lockhart Road on the east side of the 10th Sideroad. The annexation allows Barrie to meet its future population needs without having to extend into the countryside north, east and west of the city. Intensification and infilling are simultaneously being undertaken in and near the downtown core to foster a more active urban environment within the city.

=== Military ===
Barrie has a long military history dating back to at least the Nine Mile Portage of the War of 1812. By the time of the 1837 Rebellion, Simcoe County had a sufficient population to form a battalion of Sedentary Militia of almost 600 strong. This battalion was involved in marching suspected rebels down Yonge Street to Toronto in order to face justice. By 1855, Barrie was home to an independent company of Rifle Company of militia, followed in 1863 by a company of Infantry. These companies served during the Fenian Raids. With the Militia Act of 1866, the companies in Barrie were respectively organized as Number 1 and Number 5 companies, in the newly formed 35th Battalion of Infantry (Simcoe Foresters), gazetted on September 14, 1866.

In 1885, four companies from the 35th Simcoe Foresters, including those from Barrie, along with four companies from the 12th York Battalion came together to form the York-Simcoe Battalion. This specially raised battalion served in Western Canada during the North-West Rebellion, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel W.E. O&#x27;Brien of Shanty Bay, Ontario. For its efforts, The Simcoe Foresters received its first Battle Honour &quot;North West Canada 1885&quot;. Citizens of Barrie would next volunteer for military service during the Boer War in South Africa from 1899 to 1902. It was during this conflict that at the Battle of Paardeberg, the citizens of Barrie and The Simcoe Foresters suffered their first fatal casualty, Private James Halkett Findlay. Private Findlay was killed-in-action on February 18, 1900, while serving with C Company of the 2nd Battalion Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry.

In 1914, the First World War broke out and many citizens of Barrie were quick to volunteer for service overseas with The Simcoe Foresters. Late the following year, the Regiment was tasked with raising two overseas battalions, the 157th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF and the 177th Battalion (Simcoe Foresters), CEF. In the spring of 1916, the Barrie and Collingwood companies of the 157th Battalion began clearing the land for the construction of a new military camp on the Simcoe Pines Plain — Camp Borden (now CFB Borden). This began Barrie&#x27;s long friendship with the Base, hence the reason CFB Borden was used for &quot;Canada&#x27;s Worst Driver 2&quot; and &quot;Canada&#x27;s Worst Driver 5.&quot;

With a re-organization of the Canadian Militia between the two world wars, The Simcoe Foresters, headquartered in Barrie, were amalgamated in 1936 with the Grey Regiment, headquartered at Owen Sound, Ontario. This event created the present-day regiment of The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, which is headquartered at the Armoury in Queen&#x27;s Park, downtown Barrie. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, citizens of Barrie volunteered for service overseas with The Grey and Simcoe Foresters, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force. The City of Barrie sponsored a ship in the Royal Canadian Navy, HMCS &quot;Barrie&quot;, a Flower-class corvette.

=== Roads ===
Barrie is served by Provincial Highway 400, which acts as the primary route between Barrie and Toronto. Highway 400 bisects the city on a roughly north–south basis. Highway 26, also located in the city, is the main route to the Collingwood area and is known as Bayfield Street within the city limits. Barrie was once served by Highway 27, Highway 90, Highway 93, Highway 131 and Highway 11. However, the province downgraded many highways in 1997 and 1998; these highways are now known as Simcoe County Road 27, Simcoe County Road 90 (Dunlop Street), and Simcoe County Road 93.

The portion of Highway 11 through Barrie is known as Yonge Street, though it is actually part of the Penetanguishene Road. Major arterial roads within the city include Mapleview Drive, Ferndale Drive, 10th Line, Big Bay Point Road, Essa Road, Huronia Road, Bayfield Street, Cundles Road, Anne Street, Dunlop Street, Livingstone Street, Duckworth Street, Wellington Street and St. Vincent Street.

Barrie also has GO Trains and Buses.

=== Commuter rail ===
GO Transit connects the city to the Greater Toronto Area through daily train service along the Barrie line, with trains operating from the Allandale Waterfront GO Station and the Barrie South GO Station. This is primarily a commuter rail service to the GTA, with southbound trips to Toronto&#x27;s Union Station in the morning rush hour and northbound trips in the evening rush hour. Limited weekend service to and from Toronto is also operated. Barrie was once a stop for the Northlander train but re-routing resulted in the termination of service. The former Barrie station serving the Northlander still exists north of the Allandale GO Station.

=== Intercity and commuter buses ===
In addition to train service, GO Transit offers daily commuter-oriented bus service to the Greater Toronto Area. Ontario Northland operates bus routes from various locations to and from Barrie. All inter-urban buses operate from the Barrie Transit Terminal at 24 Maple Street.

Barrie once had been served by various private interurban bus lines such as Penetang-Midland Coach Lines and Greyhound Canada, which ran buses between Barrie and Toronto&#x27;s Yorkdale Bus Terminal. Greyhound operated QuickLink commuter service from Barrie to Toronto seven days a week. In the past Gray Coach offered service from Toronto to Barrie; the route was later acquired by Greyhound. Greyhound Canada ended all service in Ontario on May 13, 2021.

Barrie is also served by Simcoe County LINX, which provides services between municipalities within Simcoe County, including Orillia, Midland and Penetanguishine.

=== Passenger rail ===
Historically, Barrie was served by scheduled passenger rail service. Allandale Station was a stop for the Grand Trunk Railway, Canadian National Railway and Via Rail. In addition, Ontario Northland&#x27;s Northlander used the station as a stop, as did CN Rail/Via Rail (namely The Canadian). Regular passenger rail service to the station ended in the 1980s and has largely been replaced by regional/commuter rail service.

<text>Belleville is a city in Ontario, Canada situated on the eastern end of Lake Ontario, located at the mouth of the Moira River and on the Bay of Quinte. Its population as of the 2021 Canadian census was 55,071 (Census Metropolitan Area population 111,184). It is the seat of Hastings County, but politically independent of it, and is the centre of the Bay of Quinte Region.

==History==

The settlement was first called Singleton&#x27;s Creek after an early settler, George Singleton. Next it was called Meyer&#x27;s Creek, after prominent settler and industrialist John Walden Meyers (1745–1821), one of the founders of Belleville. He built a sawmill and grist mill. After an 1816 visit to the settlement by colonial administrator Sir Francis Gore and his wife, Lady Annabella Gore, it was renamed as Belleville in her honour.

Henry Corby, who arrived in 1832 with his new wife Alma Williams (they had married before immigrating), settled in Belleville. He was a merchant, setting up a grocery store and other businesses. He founded the H. Corby Distillery, and promoted the municipality. He also represented it in Parliament.

Their son Henry Corby Jr. (Harry) took over the family business and continued to support the town: he donated funding to create the public library, helped develop the park at Massassaga Point, established the Corby Charitable Fund, helped raise funds to build the first bridge across the Bay of Quinte and donated the land and development of Corby Park.

In 1836 Belleville became an incorporated village. By 1846, it had a population of 2040. Several stone buildings were soon constructed, including a jail and court house, as well as some of the seven churches. Transportation to other communities was by stagecoach and, in summer, by steamboat along the lake. Two weekly newspapers were published. The post office received mail daily. Several court and government offices were located here. In addition to tradesmen, there was some small industry, three cloth factories, a paper mill, two grist mills, three tanneries and two breweries. The seventeen taverns outnumbered the churches and most businesses. The oldest surviving residence within the original boundaries, 67 South Front Street, was built by Alexander Oliphant Petrie in 1814.

With the completion of the Grand Trunk Railway in 1856, Belleville became an important railway junction. Added to a booming trade in lumber and successful farming in the area, the railway helped increase the commercial and industrial growth. Belleville was incorporated as a town in 1850.

In 1858 the iron bridge was completed over the Moira River at Bridge Street; it was the first iron bridge in Hastings County. By 1865, the population reached 6,000. Telephone service to 29 subscribers was in place by 1883; electricity became available in 1885 and in 1886, the town began to offer municipal water service. In 1870, Ontario&#x27;s first school for the deaf was established in Belleville. Under Dr. Charles B. Coughlin, the school was recognized as making a significant contribution to special education. Originally called the Ontario Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, the facility was renamed as Ontario School for the Deaf. In 1974, it was renamed as the Sir James Whitney School.

Belleville&#x27;s city hall operates in a building first constructed in 1873 to house the public market and administrative offices. It was designed in the High Victorian Gothic style and retains much of its original appearance. In 1877, Belleville was legally incorporated as a city.

In 1998, the city was amalgamated with the surrounding Township of Thurlow to form an expanded City of Belleville as part of Ontario-wide municipal restructuring. The city also annexed portions of Quinte West to the west.

Late-20th-century franchises founded here include the Dixie Lee Fried Chicken chain in 1964 and, in 1978, Journey&#x27;s End Corporation&#x27;s economy, limited-service hotel chain.

==Geography==
Belleville is located at the mouth of the Moira River on the Bay of Quinte in southeastern Ontario between the cities of Quinte West to the west and Napanee to the east. These cities are connected by both Ontario&#x27;s Highway 2 and the Macdonald-Cartier Freeway (Highway 401); The city is also served by Highway 37, running north–south from Belleville towards Tweed to the east of the Moira River; and Highway 62 (once Highway 14 south of 401), northwards towards Madoc, and southward to Prince Edward County over the Bay Bridge.

Officially, Belleville is properly considered part of the Central Ontario region as it is located west of the St. Lawrence River&#x27;s starting point, but the city is popularly considered part of Eastern Ontario as it shares the eastern region&#x27;s area code 613 and K postal code.
===Climate===
Belleville&#x27;s climate has four distinct seasons. The city&#x27;s traditional humid continental climate (Dfb) (hot summers, cold winters) is moderated by its location near Lake Ontario. The lake moderates temperature extremes, cooling hot summer days and warming cold days during the fall and winter. Because of this, winter snowfall is somewhat limited due to the increased frequency of precipitation falling as rain during the winter months. In the summer months, severe thunderstorm activity is usually limited because of the non-favourable lake breeze conditions. The city, being located on the north shore of Lake Ontario, is also in an unfavourable location for lake effect snow. One notable exception, however, was in December 2010 when 14 cm of snow occurred in one day as a result of a snow band from Lake Ontario. The summer months do not typically experience exceedingly hot temperatures, however, humidity levels can make daytime highs uncomfortable. Summer rainfall is usually modest and delivered by passing thunderstorms or warm fronts. Remnants of tropical systems do pass through on occasion towards summer&#x27;s end, resulting in one or two days of consistently wet weather. The winter season is highly variable, with the record setting winter of 2007–08 experiencing near 270 cm of snow. Four years later, the winter of 2011–12 experienced only 60 cm of snow. Winter temperatures are also highly variable, even in one season. Air masses change frequently, and while a few days may see above freezing temperatures at a time in January, the next week may bring cold and snowfall. Autumn is usually mild, with an increase in precipitation starting in late September as conditions for fall storms develop. The highest temperature ever recorded in Belleville was on 9 July 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 9 February 1934.

<text>Félix François Faure (; 30 January 1841 – 16 February 1899) was President of France from 1895 until his death in 1899. A native of Paris, he worked as a tanner in his younger years. Faure became a member of the Chamber of Deputies for Seine-Inférieure in 1881. He rose to prominence in national politics up until unexpectedly assuming the presidency, during which time France&#x27;s relations with Russia improved.

According to David Bell, Felix Faure was born in Paris and moved to Le Havre where he became a successful shipowner. He moved up from local politics and was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1881. He started as a junior minister and became minister for marine and colonies. He was elected seventh president of the Third Republic in 1895 and died in office in 1899.

==Biography==
Félix François Faure was born in Paris, the son of a maker of small furniture pieces Jean-Marie Faure (1809–1889) and his first wife, Rose Cuissard (1819–1852). 

Having started as a tanner and merchant at Le Havre, Faure acquired considerable wealth, was elected to the National Assembly on 21 August 1881, and took his seat as a member of the Left, interesting himself chiefly in matters concerning economics, railways and the navy. In November 1882, he became under-secretary for the colonies in Ferry&#x27;s ministry, and retained that post till 1885. He held the same post in Tirard&#x27;s ministry in 1888, and in 1893 was made vice-president of the chamber.

In 1894, he obtained cabinet rank as minister of marine in the administration of Charles Dupuy. In the following January, he was unexpectedly elected President of the Republic upon the resignation of President Casimir-Perier. The principal cause of his elevation was the determination of the various sections of the moderate republican party to exclude Henri Brisson, who had had a plurality of votes on the first ballot, but had failed to obtain an absolute majority. To accomplish this end, it was necessary to unite the party, and such unity could be secured only by the nomination of someone who offended no one. Faure answered this description exactly.

He granted amnesty to the anarchist movements in 1895, enabling the return from exile in England of several famous anarchists, such as Émile Pouget.
In 1898 (and for the first few years of the following century), the French automobile industry was the largest in the world. President Faure was not impressed. Invited to address industry leaders at what, in retrospect, is recorded as the first Paris Motor Show, Faure told his audience, &quot;Your cars are very ugly and they smell very bad&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

His fine presence and his tact on ceremonial occasions rendered the state some service when he received the Tsar at Paris in 1896, and in 1897 returned his visit, after which meeting the Franco-Russian Alliance was publicly announced again. The latter days of Faure&#x27;s presidency were consumed by the Dreyfus affair, which he was determined to regard as (, &quot;adjudicated with no further appeal&quot;). This drew against him the criticism of pro-Dreyfus intellectuals and politicians, such as Émile Zola and Georges Clemenceau.

==Freemasonry==
Félix Faure was initiated in Le Havre, at &quot;L&#x27;aménité&quot;, a lodge of Grand Orient de France, on 25 October 1865.

==Death==

Faure died suddenly at the age of 58 from a stroke in the Élysée Palace on 16 February 1899. 

An American newspaper segment at the time read:About 6 o&#x27;clock M. Faure, who was then in his study went to the door of the room of M. LeGall, his private secretary, which is contiguous to the study, and said:

&quot;I do not feel well. Come to me.&quot;

M. LeGall immediately went to the President&#x27;s aid, led him to a sofa and called General Bailloud. General Secretary of the President&#x27;s household, M. Blondell, Under Private Secretary, and Dr. Humbert, who happened to be at the Elysee, attending a relative.

The President&#x27;s condition did not appear dangerous: but Dr. Herbert, on perceiving that he was rapidly getting worse, telephoned for Dr. Lann-Longue and Dr. Cheurlet, who arrived with M. Dupoy and were joined later by Dr. Bergeroy.

Though M. Faure still retained consciousness, the doctors recognized that the case was hopeless, but it was not until nearly 8 o&#x27;clock that the family were informed of the real state of affairs. They then came to the sofa where the President lay upon a hastily improvised bed. after he began to lose consciousness and despite all efforts expired at ten, in the presence of the family and M. Dupuy.Unconfirmed rumours at the time state he was engaged in sexual activities in his office on top of the presidential desk with the 29-year-old Marguerite Steinheil. 

It has been widely reported that those activities were oral sex, but their exact nature is in fact unknown and such reports may have stemmed from various &quot;jeux de mots&quot; (puns) made up afterward by his political opponents. According to the legend, Steinheil was performing oral sex on him when he suffered a fatal stroke, his convulsed hands tangled in her hair. This was not officially announced, but rumours started spreading immediately, although for several years it was believed that his partner at the time of his death was actress Cécile Sorel.

According to Pierre Darmon, a historian of medicine born in 1939, the popular story of Faure&#x27;s death is a legend: Félix Faure showed signs of tachycardia. A stormy meeting with the Prince Albert of Monaco (a Dreyfusard, who demanded that Germany act as guarantor for the innocent captain) would have aggravated the president&#x27;s condition. He then spent a few minutes with his mistress before fainting and returning to his office. He would have died surrounded by his family and his doctor. But according to Germain Galérant, doctor and member of the International Society for the History of Medicine, Faure died of a stroke, the first signs of which appeared several hours earlier, and the historian puts the version of the deadly antics on the account of “Mrs. Steinheil’s mythomania”.

==In popular culture==
The French barque &quot;Président Felix Faure&quot;, named for the President, was involved in a 1908 case of shipwreck at the Antipodes Islands, south of New Zealand, the survivors being stranded for sixty days before being rescued.

Faure&#x27;s liaison with Marguerite Steinheil was the subject of the film &quot;The President&#x27;s Mistress&quot; (2009) broadcast on Eurochannel, with Cristiana Reali in Steinheil&#x27;s role, and was referenced in the opening episode of the television series, &quot;Paris Police 1900&quot; (2021), with Évelyne Brochu as Steinheil.

<text>Brantford (2021 population: 104,688) is a city in Ontario, Canada, founded on the Grand River in Southwestern Ontario. It is surrounded by Brant County but is politically separate with a municipal government of its own that is fully independent of the county&#x27;s municipal government.

Brantford is situated on the Haldimand Tract, and is named after Joseph Brant, a Mohawk leader, soldier, farmer and slave owner. Brant was an important Loyalist leader during the American Revolutionary War and later, after the Haudenosaunee moved to the Brantford area in Upper Canada. Many of his descendants and other First Nations people live on the nearby Six Nations of the Grand River reserve south of Brantford; it is the most populous reserve in Canada.

Brantford is known as the &quot;Telephone City&quot; because the city&#x27;s famous resident, Alexander Graham Bell, invented the first telephone at his father&#x27;s homestead, Melville House, now the Bell Homestead, located in Tutela Heights south of the city. Brantford is also known as the birthplace and hometown of Wayne Gretzky and Phil Hartman.

== History ==
The Iroquoian-speaking Attawandaron, known in English as the Neutral Nation, lived in the Grand River valley area before the 17th century; their main village and seat of the chief, Kandoucho, was identified by 19th-century historians as having been located on the Grand River where present-day Brantford developed. This community, like the rest of their settlements, was destroyed when the Iroquois declared war in 1650 over the fur trade and exterminated the Neutral nation.

In 1784, Captain Joseph Brant and the Mohawk people of the Iroquois Confederacy left New York State for Canada. As a reward for their loyalty to the British Crown, they were given a large land grant, referred to as the Haldimand Tract, on the Grand River. The original Mohawk settlement was on the south edge of the present-day city at a location favourable for landing canoes. Brant&#x27;s crossing (or fording) of the river gave the original name to the area: Brant&#x27;s ford The Glebe Farm Indian Reserve exists at the original site today.

The area began to grow from a small settlement in the 1820s as the Hamilton and London Road was improved. By the 1830s, Brantford became a stop on the Underground Railroad, and a sizable number of runaway African-Americans settled in the town. From the 1830s to the 1860s – several hundred people of African descent settled in the area around Murray Street, and in Cainsville. In Brantford, they established their own school and church, now known as the S.R. Drake Memorial Church. In 1846, it is estimated 2000 residents lived in the city&#x27;s core while 5199 lived in the outlying rural areas. There were eight churches in Brantford at this time – Episcopal, Presbyterian, Catholic, two Methodist, Baptist, Congregational, and one for the African-Canadian residents.

By 1847, Europeans began to settle further up the river at a ford in the Grand River and named their village Brantford. The population increased after 1848 when river navigation to Brantford was opened and again in 1854 with the arrival of the railway to Brantford.

Because of the ease of navigation from new roads and the Grand River, several manufacturing companies could be found in the town by 1869. Some of these factories included Brantford Engine Works, Victoria Foundry and Britannia Foundry. Several major farm implement manufacturers, starting with Cockshutt and Harris, opened for business in the 1870s.

The history of the Brantford region from 1793 to 1920 is described at length in the book &quot;At The Forks of The Grand&quot;.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Canadian government encouraged the education of First Nations children at residential schools, which were intended to teach them English and European-Canadian ways and assimilate them into the majority cultures. Such institutions in or near Brantford included the Thomas Indian School, Mohawk Institute Residential School (also known as Mohawk Manual Labour School and Mush Hole Indian Residential School), and the Haudenosaunee boarding school. Decades later and particularly since the late 20th century, numerous scholarly and artistic works have explored the detrimental effects of the schools in destroying Native cultures. Examples include Ronald James Douglas&#x27; graduate thesis titled &quot;Documenting Ethnic Cleansing in North America: Creating Unseen Tears&quot;, and the Legacy of Hope Foundation&#x27;s online media collection: &quot;Where are the Children? Healing the Legacy of the Residential Schools&quot;.

In June 1945, Brantford became the first city in Canada to fluoridate its water supply.

Brantford generated controversy in 2010 when its city council expropriated and demolished 41 historic downtown buildings on the south side of its main street, Colborne Street. The buildings constituted one of the longest blocks of pre-Confederation architecture in Canada and included one of Ontario&#x27;s first grocery stores and an early 1890s office of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada. The decision was widely criticized by Ontario&#x27;s heritage preservation community, however, the city argued it was needed for downtown renewal.

=== Historical plaques and memorials ===
Plaques and monuments erected by the provincial and federal governments provide additional glimpses into the early history of the area around Brantford.

The famed Mohawk Chief Joseph Brant (Thayendanega) led his people from the Mohawk Valley of New York State to Upper Canada after being allied with the British during the American Revolution, where they lost their land holdings. A group of 400 settled in 1788 on the Grand River at Mohawk Village which would later become Brantford. Nearly a century later (1886), the Joseph Brant Memorial would be erected in Burlington, Ontario in honour of Brant and the Six Nations Confederacy.

The Mohawk Chapel, built by the British Crown in 1785 for the Mohawk and Iroquois people (Six Nations of the Grand River), was dedicated in 1788 as a reminder of the original agreements made with the British during the American Revolution. 
In 1904 the chapel received Royal status by King Edward VII in memory of the longstanding alliance. Her Majesty&#x27;s Royal Chapel of the Mohawks is an important reminder of the original agreements made with Queen Anne in 1710. It is still in use today as one of two royal Chapels in Canada and the oldest Protestant Church in the province. Joseph Brant and his son John Brant are buried here.

Chief John Brant (Mohawk leader) (Ahyonwaeghs) was one of the sons of Joseph Brant. He fought with the British during the War of 1812 and later worked to improve the welfare of the First Nations. He was involved in building schools and improving the welfare of his people. Brant initiated the opening of schools and, from 1828, served as the first native Superintendent of the Six Nations. Chief Brant was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for Haldimand in 1830 and was the first aboriginal Canadian in Parliament.

The stone and brick Brant County Courthouse was built on land purchased from the Six Nations in 1852. The structure housed courtrooms, county offices, a law library and a gaol. During additions in the 1880s, the Greek Revival style, with Doric columns, was retained.

Among the most famed residents were Alexander Graham Bell and his family, who arrived in mid 1870 from Scotland while Bell was suffering from tuberculosis. They lived with Bell&#x27;s father and mother, who had settled in a farmhouse on Tutela Heights (named after the First Nations tribe of the area and later absorbed into Brantford.) Then called Melville House, it is now a museum, the Bell Homestead National Historic Site. This was the site of the invention of the telephone in 1874 and ongoing trials in 1876. The Bell Memorial, also known as the Bell Monument, was commissioned to commemorate Bell&#x27;s invention of the telephone in Brantford; it is also one of the National Historic Sites of Canada.

=== Invention of the telephone ===
Some articles suggest that the telephone was invented in Boston, where Alexander Graham Bell did a great deal of work on the development of the device. However, Bell confirmed Brantford as the birthplace of the device in a 1906 speech: &quot;the telephone problem was solved, and it was solved at my father&#x27;s home&quot;. At the unveiling of the Bell Memorial on 24 October 1917, Bell reminded the attendees that &quot;Brantford is right in claiming the invention of the telephone here... [which was] conceived in Brantford in 1874 and born in Boston in 1875&quot; and that &quot;the first transmission to a distance was made between Brantford and Paris&quot; (on 3 August 1876). As well, the second successful voice transmission (over a distance of 6 km; 4 miles) was also made in the area, on 4 August 1876, between the telegraph office in Brantford, Ontario and Bell&#x27;s father&#x27;s homestead over makeshift wires.

Canada&#x27;s first telephone factory, created by James Cowherd, was located in Brantford and operated from about 1879 until Cowherd&#x27;s death in 1881. The first telephone business office which opened in 1877, not far from the Bell Homestead, was located in what is now Brantford. The combination of events has led to Brantford calling itself &quot;The Telephone City&quot;.

== Law and government ==
Brantford is located within the County of Brant; however, it is a single-tier municipality, politically separate from the county. &quot;Ontario&#x27;s Municipal Act, 2001&quot; defines single-tier municipalities as &quot;a municipality, other than an upper-tier municipality, that does not form part of an upper-tier municipality for municipal purposes.&quot; Single-tier municipalities provide for all local government services.

At the federal and provincial levels of government, Brantford is part of the Brant riding.

Brantford City Council is the municipal governing body. As of October 22, 2018, the mayor is Kevin Davis.

=== Safety ===
Brantford&#x27;s economy was hit hard in the 1980s when farm equipment manufacturers Massey Ferguson and White Farm Equipment closed their local plants. By the end of 1981, the city&#x27;s unemployment rate reached 22%. As with other small Ontario cities hit by the decline of manufacturing, the community struggled with an increase in social problems.

In more recent times, the city was hit hard by the opioid crisis. In 2018, Brantford had the highest rate of emergency department visits for overdose of any city in Ontario. In 2018, Brantford police reported an overall crime rate of 6,533 incidents per 100,000 population, 59% higher than in Ontario (4,113) and 19% higher than in Canada (5,488). The same year, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine ranked Brantford as having a higher rate of crime severity than most of the province.

== Economy ==
The electric telephone was invented here leading to the establishment of Canada&#x27;s first telephone factory here in the 1870s. Brantford developed as an important Canadian industrial centre for the first half of the 20th century, and it was once the third-ranked Canadian city in terms of the cash value of manufactured goods exported.

The city developed at the deepest navigable point of the Grand River. Because of existing networks, it became a railroad hub of Southern Ontario. The combination of water and rail helped Brantford develop from a farming community into an industrial city with many blue-collar jobs based on the agriculture implementation industry. Major companies included S.C. Johnson Wax, Massey-Harris, Verity Plow, and the Cockshutt Plow Company. This industry, more than any other, provided the well-paying and steady employment that allowed Brantford to sustain economic growth through most of the 20th century.

By the 1980s and 1990s, Brantford&#x27;s economy was in steady decline due to changes in heavy industry and its restructuring. Numerous companies suffered bankruptcies, such as White Farm Equipment, Massey Ferguson (and its successor, Massey Combines Corporation), Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and other manufacturers. The bankruptcies and closures of the businesses left thousands of people unemployed. As a consequence, it became one of the most economically depressed areas in the country, leaving a negative impact on the once-vibrant downtown.

An economic revival was prompted by the completion of the Brantford-to-Ancaster section of Highway 403 in 1997, bringing companies easy access to Hamilton and Toronto and completing a direct route from Detroit to Buffalo. In 2004 Procter &amp; Gamble and Ferrero SpA chose to locate in the city. Though Wescast Industries, Inc. recently closed its local foundry, its corporate headquarters will remain in Brantford. SC Johnson Canada has their headquarters and a manufacturing plant in Brantford, connected to the Canadian National network. Other companies that have their headquarters here include Gunther Mele and GreenMantra Technologies. On February 16, 2005, Brant, including Brantford, was added to the Greater Golden Horseshoe along with Haldimand and Northumberland counties.

In February 2019, Brantford&#x27;s unemployment rate stood at 4.6% – lower than Ontario&#x27;s rate of 5.6%.

<text>Brockville, formerly Elizabethtown, is a city in Eastern Ontario, Canada, in the Thousand Islands region. Although it is the seat of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, it is politically independent of the county. It is included with Leeds and Grenville for census purposes only.

Known as the &quot;City of the 1000 Islands&quot;, Brockville is located on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, about halfway between Kingston to the west and Cornwall to the east. It is south of the national capital Ottawa. Brockville faces the village of Morristown, New York, on the south side of the river.

Brockville is situated on the land which was previously inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians and later by the Oswegatchie people. Brockville is one of Ontario&#x27;s oldest communities established by Loyalist settlers and is named after the British general Sir Isaac Brock.

Tourist attractions in Brockville include the Brockville Tunnel, Fulford Place, and the Aquatarium.

==History==
Human inhabitation of the upper St. Lawrence River dates at least to the late Middle Woodland period by the Point Peninsula people. Iron oxide pictographs on rock faces have been documented on the Fulford property in Brockville and at Hillcrest west of Brockville. From around 1450 until sometime in the 1500s, the St. Lawrence Iroquoians established a cluster of palisaded agricultural villages in the vicinity of Brockville and Prescott, the Roebuck site being the best known. By 1751, the Oswegatchie people had occupied the north shore of the St. Lawrence between Toniato Creek (now known as Jones Creek, in Thousand Islands National Park) and the Long Sault. After negotiations with the British, they withdrew from the frontage on the north shore of the St. Lawrence in 1784, resettling at what is now Lisbon, New York.

This area of Ontario was first settled by English speakers in 1784, when thousands of American refugees arrived from the American colonies after the American Revolutionary War. They were later called United Empire Loyalists because of their continued allegiance to King George III. The struggle between Britain and the 13 American colonies occurred in the years 1776 to 1783 and seriously divided loyalties among people in some colonies such as New York and Vermont. In many areas, traders and merchants, especially in the coastal cities or the northern border regions, had stronger business ties and allegiance to the Crown than did the frontiersmen of the interior. During the six-year war, which ended with the capitulation of the British in 1782, many colonists who remained loyal to the crown were frequently subject to harsh reprisals and unfair dispossession of their property by their fellow citizens. Many Loyalists chose to flee north to the British colony of Quebec. Great Britain opened the western region of Canada (first known as Upper Canada and now Ontario), purchasing land from First Nations to allocate to the predominantly English-speaking Loyalists in compensation for their losses and helping them with some supplies as they founded new settlements. The first years were very harsh as they struggled on the frontier. Some exiles returned to the United States.

The Saint Lawrence River got its name from explorer Jacques Cartier&#x27;s arrival in the gulf on August 10, 1535, the feast day of the martyred Roman Christian, Saint Lawrence. In 1785, the first Loyalist to take up land where Brockville is now located was William Buell Sr. (1751–1832), an ensign disbanded from the King&#x27;s Rangers from the state of New York. Residents commonly called the first settlement Buell&#x27;s Bay. Around 1810, government officials of Upper Canada assigned the name Elizabethtown to the developing village.

During mid-1812, the Hon. Charles Jones, and other leading residents of the village, then known by the misleading name Elizabethtown, started to refer to the village as Brockville in their correspondence. The commanding British General in Upper Canada and temporary administrator of the province was Major-General Isaac Brock. He was celebrated as the &quot;Hero and Saviour&quot; of Upper Canada because of his recent success in securing the surrender by Americans of Fort Detroit during the first months of the War of 1812. After the surrender of Fort Detroit, General Brock was next involved in other battles on the Niagara Peninsula. On October 13, 1812, he was fatally wounded while leading troops up the heights near the village of Queenston, then temporarily held by American militia. General Brock had learned of the honour being offered by the residents of Elizabethtown but had no chance to give it his official blessing before his death. It took several years for Provincial officials to officially accept the new name, though most residents used it. A raid on Elizabethtown occurred on the early morning of February 7, 1813, when Benjamin Forsyth and 200 of his American forces crossed the frozen Saint Lawrence River, occupied the settlement, seized military and public stores, freed American prisoners, and captured local militia soldiers and leading citizens.

By 1830, the population of Brockville exceeded 1,000. This entitled it to be represented by its own elected member in the House of Assembly. Henry Jones, the village postmaster, was elected in October 1830 to the 11th Parliament of the Province.

Brockville became Ontario&#x27;s first incorporated self-governing town on January 28, 1832, two years before the town of Toronto. After the passing of the Brockville Police Act passed by the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, Brockville was granted the power to govern its own affairs, pass laws, and raise taxes. The first elections for the new Board of Police were held on April 2, 1832, when four male citizens were elected to the Police Board. These four, in turn, chose a fifth member, Daniel Jones, who became the first Police Board President (or Mayor) of Brockville. In March 1836, he became the first native Upper Canadian to receive a knighthood for services to the Crown.

By 1846, the population was 2,111. This growth was accompanied by the construction of many buildings made of stone and brick. There was a County courthouse and Jail, six churches or chapels, and a steamboat pier for travel to and from Montreal and Kingston. Two newspapers were published, two bank agencies were established, and the post office received mail daily. Several court and government departments had offices here. The first industries consisted of one grist mill, four tanneries, two asheries and four wagon makers, in addition to tradespeople of various types.

Later in the 19th century, the town developed as a local centre of industry, including shipbuilding, saddleries, tanneries, tinsmiths, a foundry, a brewery, and several hotels. By 1854, a patent medicine industry had sprung up in Brockville and Morristown, New York, across the Saint Lawrence River, featuring such products as Dr Morse&#x27;s Indian Root Pills, Dr. McKenzie&#x27;s Worm Tablets, and later, Dr. Williams&#x27; Pink Pills for Pale People.

In 1855, Brockville was chosen as a divisional point of the new Grand Trunk Railway between Montreal and Toronto. This contributed to its growth, as it could offer jobs in railway maintenance and related fields. At the same time, the north–south line of the Brockville and Ottawa Railway was built to join the timber trade of the Ottawa Valley with the Saint Lawrence River ship route. A well-engineered tunnel for this railway was dug and blasted underneath the middle of Brockville. Completed in December 1860, the Brockville Tunnel was the first railway tunnel built in Canada.

Brockville and many other towns in Canada West were targets of the threatened Fenian invasion after the American Civil War ended in 1865. In June 1866, the Irish-American Brotherhood of Fenians invaded Canada. They launched raids across the Niagara River into Canada West (Ontario) and from Vermont into Canada East (Quebec). Canadian Prime Minister John A. Macdonald called upon the volunteer militia companies in every town to protect Canada. The Brockville Infantry Company and the Brockville Rifle Company (now The Brockville Rifles) were mobilized. The unsuccessful Fenian Raids was a catalyst that contributed to the creation of the new confederated Canada in 1867.

By 1869, Brockville had a population of 5000 and a passenger station on the Grand Trunk Railway. It was the County Town of the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville and a Port of Entry. Steamboats stopped in Brockville daily while plying among Montreal, Kingston, Toronto and Hamilton. The Brockville and Ottawa Railway connected Brockville with Smith&#x27;s Falls, Perth, Almonte, Carleton Place and Sand Point. During the summer, a steam ferry plied every half-hour between Brockville and Morristown, New York.

In 1962, Brockville was granted official status as a city. Its coat of arms featured a beehive surrounded by a golden chain and bears the motto &quot;Industria, Intelligentia, Prosperitas&quot;. This is an official heraldic design. Brockville is one of the few Canadian cities to have a recognized heraldic flag.
==Climate==
Brockville experiences a humid continental climate (Dfb). The highest temperature ever recorded in Brockville was on July 31, 1917, and June 4, 1919. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on February 4, 1886, and January 28, 1925.

==Transportation and communications==
Brockville is midway between Toronto and Montreal ( northeast of Toronto and southwest of Montreal), and just over one hour from Ottawa. Highway 401 runs through Brockville, with exits at Leeds &amp; Grenville County Road 29 and North Augusta Road. There are several daily Via Rail connections at Brockville station to Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa along the Corridor.

The town has a municipal airport (Brockville Regional Tackaberry Airport) in the neighbouring Elizabethtown-Kitley Township. The Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport is approximately 100 km away.

The Thousand Islands Bridge and the Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge, both of which cross the Saint Lawrence River into New York, are south-west and north-east from Brockville, respectively.

Brockville Transit is the city-operated public transit system that covers the urban area and provides three regular scheduled bus routes and paratransit services from Monday to Saturday.

==Economy==

Brockville is home to several large industrial manufacturers. 3M operates four factories in Brockville, manufacturing tape and occupational health and safety products. Procter &amp; Gamble manufactured dryer sheets and cleaning products from the brands their brands Bounce and Swiffer respectively, employing 600 people, however, operations began to slow down in 2017 until the closure of the plant in 2020 and all operations of the plant being moved to locations in West Virginia. In January 2022, the Canadian food company Leclerc, a brand known for making dessert products, announced it would be moving into the vacant P&amp;G plant. 
Other industries include manufacturer Canarm, pharmaceutical manufacturer Trillium Canada, and the oil-blending plant of Shell Canada. Canadian retailer Giant Tiger has also opened a distribution centre for frozen food in Brockville. Some area residents are employed at the Invista Canada facility (formerly DuPont Canada Ltd.) in Maitland, just east of Brockville.

Brockville is also the primary administrative, health-care, and commercial centre for Leeds—Grenville county. The Upper Canada District School Board is headquartered in Brockville. The Brockville General Hospital has completed a major expansion project. The Brockville Mental Health Centre is located east of Brockville.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Brockville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.



==Tourism==
Brockville, known as The City of the Thousand Islands, is located on the shore of the Saint Lawrence River. The city revitalized its downtown area, enhancing a waterfront open to the public with parks, walking trails, and numerous shopping locations. The city is an outdoor architecture museum with hundreds of exemplary buildings from all historical periods on its streets.

The Aquatarium at Tall Ships Landing operates the Tourism Office or Visitor Information Centre at 6 Broad Street, along with a small outlet on Blockhouse Island during the Summer season. Both are close to the south end of the Brockville Tunnel, Canada&#x27;s first railway tunnel. Closed in 1970, it was acquired by Brockville in 1982, and the tunnel reopened in August 2017 as an LED illuminated pedestrian tunnel with music.

The Aquatarium is an interactive discovery centre about the ecology and history of the 1000 Islands region, opened in March 2016. It is located at the bottom of Broad Street next to the Tall Ships Landing, a condominium project. Both overlook the Saint Lawrence River.

The classically designed Brockville Court House, built in 1842–43 and set in its surrounding central Court House Square, stands as the most impressive of all of Brockville&#x27;s 19th-century architectural structures. It was designed by Toronto architect John G. Howard, who is known to have designed three buildings in Brockville.

The Fulford Place house museum was built in 1899–1901 for Senator George Taylor Fulford at 287 King Street East in Brockville&#x27;s east end. His palatial home was built on his successful marketing of patent medicines, including Dr. Williams&#x27; Pink Pills for Pale People around the world. He was one of the area&#x27;s wealthiest industrialists before his death in 1905. The house owned and operated by the Ontario Heritage Trust is open for public tours on a seasonal schedule.

The Brockville Museum, situated in the historic downtown core at 5 Henry Street, features exhibits and artifacts related to Brockville&#x27;s rich history and the city&#x27;s development as a waterfront community.

The John H. Fulford Memorial Fountain was erected in 1917.

The &quot;1000 Islands &amp; Seaway Cruises&quot; company offers scenic cruises on the Saint Lawrence River departing from Brockville.

The Brockville area is the launching point for underwater wreck diving on sunken ships discovered in the Saint Lawrence, and several dive operators take divers to these sites. In 2014, Brockville collaborated with S.O.S. (Save Ontario Shipwrecks) to launch an underwater Sculpture Park off of Centeen Park. New sculptures are added annually. (Since the early 1990s, underwater visibility has increased due to the effects of the invasive species zebra mussels.)

Brockville was named one of Canada&#x27;s safest communities by the World Health Organization.

===Brockville boating===

Brockville&#x27;s boating resources include a Municipal Harbour and public marina, a Yacht Club, and several commercial marinas. Upstream is the Brockville-owned Islands group, which contains some city island parks, as well as an island park belonging to the Thousand Islands National Park system.

Brockville is at the downstream end of the Thousand Islands region, which extends to Kingston, Ontario (at the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River at Lake Ontario), away.

The Brockville Concert Band arises from a long tradition of community and military bands in Brockville. Civic bands provided entertainment at public venues such as community picnics and outdoor skating rinks. The Brockville Rifles Reserve Band entertained &quot;on the green&quot; in the 1930s and 40s.

Military band members returning from the Second World War formed the Brockville Civic Band. Re-organized as the &quot;Brockville Concert Band&quot; in 1974, it inherited a musical tradition (and sheet music) from civic and military bands dating back to the turn of the 20th century. The Brockville Concert Band used to play a series of summer concerts every second Tuesday in Hardy Park in Brockville within view of the Saint Lawrence River. The band also plays for various civic functions and entertains at charitable fundraising events. The band&#x27;s musical director and conductor are now co-conducted by Judy Quick and Christopher Coyea.

The TISS team travels all over North America including Ohio, Florida, New Hampshire, and British Columbia, consistently winning major international championships. The school&#x27;s accomplishments have inspired the community to construct a $1.5 million athletic centre at the school.

===Hockey===
The Brockville Braves are a Tier I Junior &quot;A&quot; ice hockey team representing Brockville. They are a part of the Central Junior A Hockey League.

Founded in 1963, the Brockville Braves are the second oldest team that has never ceased operation in CJHL history—second only to Pembroke. In 1979, the team was the focus of national attention when it was left homeless due to its arena collapsing. This did not stop the Braves, though. Playing their home games out of Cardinal and Rockland, Ontario, the Braves did not miss a beat.

It took until 1986 for the Brockville Braves to win a CJHL championship. They clinched the Bogart Cup on a late April night, defeating their nemesis, Pembroke Lumber Kings, 8–7 in the finals. Braves&#x27; goalie Jacques Breault was the hero, as with 22 seconds to go in the game, he turned away a penalty shot by the league&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, Luc Chabot. Although losing to Orillia, Ontario, in the Ontario playdowns, the team was memorable. Notable members of this team were all-time Braves leading scorer Larry Mitchell, Breault, Paul Duford, Tim Dubas, Dan Nummikoski, Steve Rachwal, Chad Badawey and Rob White.

Since that championship, the team has experienced more bad times than good. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Braves failed to make the playoffs multiple times.

In 1997, times began to change for the better again. The Braves were tasked with hosting the Fred Page Cup, the Eastern Canadian Junior &quot;A&quot; championship. This allowed their team to compete in the event and gave them the experience they needed for the next season. In 1998, the Braves won their league title again, completing a full circle for the club. The team also hosted and won the 2010 Fred Page Cup by defeating the Pembroke Lumber Kings 5–1. The Braves are the second host team to win since the 1998–99 Charlottetown Abbies, who defeated the CCHL&#x27;s Hawkesbury Hawks 2–0 at the Charlottetown Civic Centre.

Star graduates Bryan Murray (Barry&#x27;s Bay, Ontario), Mike Daoust (Brockville, Ontario) and Guy Come (Iroquois Falls, Ontario) of the Brockville Braves won the 2001 NCAA National Championship with the Plattsburgh Cardinals vs the RIT Tigers.

In November 2017, the grounds at Rotary Park were excavated to build a new skating rink, complete with a bathroom and change rooms. On January 9, 2020, the new building was named P&amp;G Pavilion after its biggest sponsor, the local company Procter &amp; Gamble.

<doc id="178870" wikidata="Q727055" url="?curid=178870" title="Atavism">
<text>In biology, an atavism is a modification of a biological structure whereby an ancestral genetic trait reappears after having been lost through evolutionary change in previous generations. Atavisms can occur in several ways, one of which is when genes for previously existing phenotypic features are preserved in DNA, and these become expressed through a mutation that either knocks out the dominant genes for the new traits or makes the old traits dominate the new one. A number of traits can vary as a result of shortening of the fetal development of a trait (neoteny) or by prolongation of the same. In such a case, a shift in the time a trait is allowed to develop before it is fixed can bring forth an ancestral phenotype. Atavisms are often seen as evidence of evolution.

In social sciences, atavism is the tendency of reversion: for example, people in the modern era reverting to the ways of thinking and acting of a former time.

The word &quot;atavism&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;atavus&quot;—a great-great-great-grandfather or, more generally, an ancestor.

==Biology==
Evolutionarily traits that have disappeared phenotypically do not necessarily disappear from an organism&#x27;s DNA. The gene sequence often remains, but is inactive. Such an unused gene may remain in the genome for many generations. As long as the gene remains intact, a fault in the genetic control suppressing the gene can lead to it being expressed again. Sometimes, the expression of dormant genes can be induced by artificial stimulation.

Atavisms have been observed in humans, such as with infants born with vestigial tails (called a &quot;coccygeal process&quot;, &quot;coccygeal projection&quot;, or &quot;caudal appendage&quot;). Atavism can also be seen in humans who possess large teeth, like those of other primates. In addition, a case of &quot;snake heart&quot;, the presence of &quot;coronary circulation and myocardial architecture [that closely] resemble those of the reptilian heart&quot;, has also been reported in medical literature. Atavism has also recently been induced in avian dinosaur (bird) fetuses to express dormant ancestral non-avian dinosaur (non-bird) features, including teeth.

Other examples of observed atavisms include:
*Hind limbs in cetaceans and sirenians.
*Extra toes of the modern horse.
*Reappearance of limbs in limbless vertebrates.
*Re-evolution of sexuality from parthenogenesis in oribatid mites.
*Teeth in avian dinosaurs (birds).
*Dewclaws in dogs.
*Reappearance of prothoracic wings in insects.
*Reappearance of wings on wingless stick insects and leaf insects and earwigs.
*Atavistic muscles in several birds and mammals such as the beagle and the jerboa.
*Extra toes in guinea pigs.
*Reemergence of sexual reproduction in the flowering plant &quot;Hieracium pilosella&quot; and the Crotoniidae family of mites.
*Webbed feet in adult axolotls.
*Human tails (not pseudo-tails) and supernumerary nipples in humans (and other primates).
*Color blindness in humans.

==Culture==
Atavism is a term in Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s explanation of World War I in twentieth-century liberal Europe. He defends the liberal international relations theory that an international society built on commerce will avoid war because of war&#x27;s destructiveness and comparative cost. His reason for World War I is termed &quot;atavism&quot;, in which he asserts that senescent governments in Europe (those of the German Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, and Austro-Hungarian Empire) pulled the liberal Europe into war, and that the liberal regimes of the other continental powers did not cause it. He used this idea to say that liberalism and commerce would continue to have a soothing effect in international relations, and that war would not arise between nations which are connected by commercial ties. This latter idea is very similar to the later Golden Arches theory.

University of London professor Guy Standing has identified three distinct sub-groups of the precariat, one of which he refers to as &quot;atavists&quot;, who long for what they see as a lost past.

===Social Darwinism===

During the interval between the acceptance of evolution in the mid-1800s and the rise of the modern understanding of genetics in the early 1900s, atavism was used to account for the reappearance in an individual of a trait after several generations of absence—often called a &quot;throw-back&quot;. The idea that atavisms could be made to accumulate by selective breeding, or breeding back, led to breeds such as Heck cattle. This had been bred from ancient landraces with selected primitive traits, in an attempt of &quot;reviving&quot; the aurochs, an extinct species of wild cattle. The same notions of atavisms were used by social Darwinists, who claimed that &quot;inferior&quot; races displayed atavistic traits, and represented more primitive traits than other races. Both atavism&#x27;s and Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s recapitulation theory are related to evolutionary progress, as development towards a greater complexity and a superior ability.

In addition, the concept of atavism as part of an individualistic explanation of the causes of criminal deviance was popularised by the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso in the 1870s. He attempted to identify physical characteristics common to criminals and labeled those he found as atavistic, &#x27;throw-back&#x27; traits that determined &#x27;primitive&#x27; criminal behavior. His statistical evidence and the closely related idea of eugenics have long since been abandoned by the scientific community, but the concept that physical traits may affect the likelihood of criminal or unethical behavior in a person still has some scientific support.

<doc id="178876" wikidata="Q34218" url="?curid=178876" title="Burlington, Ontario">
<text>Burlington, officially the City of Burlington, is a city and lower-tier municipality in Halton Region at the west end of Lake Ontario in Ontario, Canada. Burlington is part of the Greater Toronto Area, the Hamilton census metropolitan area, and the Golden Horseshoe urban region. 

==History==

Before the 19th century, the area between the provincial capital of York and the township of West Flamborough was home to the Mississauga nation. In 1792, John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, named the western end of Lake Ontario &quot;Burlington Bay&quot; after the town of Bridlington in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.

The British purchased the land on which Burlington now stands from the Mississaugas in Upper Canada Treaties 3 (1792), 8 (1797), 14 (1806), and 19 (1818). Treaty 8 concerned the purchase of the Brant Tract, on Burlington Bay which the British granted to Mohawk chief Joseph Brant for his service in the American Revolutionary War. Joseph Brant and his household settled on this tract of land around 1802. Brant is accordingly often referred to as the founder of Burlington, and the city of Burlington still celebrates an annual Joseph Brant Day in early August. Subsequent disputes between the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation and the Canadian government over payment for the Brant Tract and the Toronto Purchase were settled in 2010 for the sum of $145 million (CAD).

By the turn of the 19th century, the name &quot;Burlington&quot; was already in common use. With the completion of the local survey after the War of 1812, the land was opened for settlement. Early farmers prospered in the Burlington area because the area had fertile soil and moderate temperatures. Produce from the farms was shipped out via the bustling docks of the lakeside villages of Port Nelson and Wellington Square, as well as Brown&#x27;s Wharf in the nearby village of Port Flamborough (which was to become Aldershot). Lumber taken from the surrounding forests also competed for space on the busy docks. In the latter half of the 19th century, increased wheat production from Western Canada convinced local farmers to switch to fruit and vegetable production.

In 1873, the villages of Wellington Square and Port Nelson merged to become the Village of Burlington which then became the Town of Burlington in 1914. The arrival of large steamships on the Great Lakes made the small docks of the local ports obsolete, and the increased use of railway to ship goods marked the end of the commercial wharves.

Farming still thrived though, and the resultant growth resulted in continued prosperity. By 1906, the town boasted its own newspaper—the &quot;Burlington Gazette&quot;—as well as a town library and a local rail line that connected Burlington to nearby Hamilton. During the First World War, 300 local men volunteered for duty in the Canadian Expeditionary Force—38 did not return. In 1914, Burlington was incorporated into a town.

As more settlers arrived and cleared the land, cash crops replaced subsistence farming. Gradually, mixed farming and market gardens became the dominant form of agriculture, and in the early 20th century the area was declared the &quot;Garden of Canada&quot;. The first peaches grown in Canada were cultivated in the Grindstone Creek watershed in the city&#x27;s south-west part. The farming tradition has passed down through the generations. Today over 40 per cent of the Grindstone Creek watershed is still devoted to farms, orchards and nurseries.

Following the Second World War, cheap electricity from nearby Niagara Falls and better transportation access due to the new (1939) Queen Elizabeth Way encouraged both light industry and families to move to Burlington. The population skyrocketed as new homes were built, encouraging developers to build even more new homes. On 1 January 1958, Burlington officially annexed most of the Township of Nelson, as well as Aldershot, formerly a part of East Flamborough Township. By 1967, the last cash crop farm within the city had been replaced by the Burlington Centre.

Burlington was the site of the Brant Inn built by the lake in 1917, which became famous during the ’40s and ’50s for showing big-band performers.

By 1974, with a population exceeding 100,000, Burlington was incorporated as a city. The extremely high rate of growth continued, and between 2001 and 2006, the population of Burlington grew by 9%, compared to Canada&#x27;s overall growth rate of 5.4%. By 2006, the population topped 160,000.

==Geography==

Burlington is at the southwestern end of Lake Ontario, just to the north east of Hamilton and the Niagara Peninsula, roughly in the geographic centre of the urban corridor known as the Golden Horseshoe. Burlington has a land area of . The main urban area is south of the Parkway Belt and Highway 407. The land north of this, and north Aldershot is used primarily for agriculture, rural residential and conservation purposes. The Niagara Escarpment, Lake Ontario and the sloping plain between the escarpment and the lake make up the land area of Burlington. The city is no longer a port; sailing vessels in the area are used for recreational purposes and moor at a 215 slip marina in LaSalle Park.

===Climate===
Burlington&#x27;s climate is humid continental (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) with warm to hot, humid summers and cold, sometimes snowy winters. The climate is moderated somewhat by its proximity to Lake Ontario. Monthly mean temperatures range from in July to in January. The average annual precipitation is of rain and of snow.

Several species of flora and fauna usually found only in more southern climes are present in Burlington, including paw-paw (&quot;Asimina triloba&quot;), green dragon (&quot;Arisaema dracontium&quot;), tuckahoe (&quot;Peltandra virginica&quot;), American columbo (&quot;Frasera caroliniensis&quot;), wall-rue (&quot;Asplenium ruta-muraria&quot;), plus the Louisiana waterthrush, hooded warbler, southern flying squirrel and rare eastern pipistrelle bat. Near the visible promontory of Mount Nemo that rises some 200 m (650 ft) above the lake level, a &quot;vertical forest&quot; of white cedar clinging to the Escarpment face includes many small trees that are more than one thousand years old.
