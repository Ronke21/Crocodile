<text>Sir Edward Coley Burne-Jones, 1st Baronet, (; 28 August 183317 June 1898) was an English painter and designer associated with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood&#x27;s style and subject matter.

Burne-Jones worked with William Morris as a founding partner in Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co in the design of decorative arts. His early paintings show the influence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, but by 1870 he had developed his own style. In 1877, he exhibited eight oil paintings at the Grosvenor Gallery, a new rival to the Royal Academy of Arts. These included &quot;The Beguiling of Merlin&quot;. The timing was right and he was taken up as a herald and star of the new Aesthetic Movement.

In the studio of Morris and Co. Burne-Jones worked as a designer of a wide range of crafts including ceramic tiles, jewellery, tapestries, and mosaics. Among his most significant and lasting designs are those for stained glass windows the production of which was a revived craft during the 19th century. His designs are still to be found in churches across the UK, with examples in the US and Australia.

==Early life==

Born Edward Coley Burne Jones (the hyphenation of his last names was introduced later) was born in Birmingham, the son of a Welshman, Edward Richard Jones, a frame-maker at Bennetts Hill, where a blue plaque commemorates the painter&#x27;s childhood. A pub on the site of the house is called the &quot;Briar Rose&quot; in honour of Burne-Jones&#x27; work. His mother Elizabeth Jones (née Coley) died within six days of his birth, and Edward was raised by his father, and the family housekeeper, Ann Sampson, an obsessively affectionate but humourless, and unintellectual local girl. He attended Birmingham&#x27;s King Edward VI grammar school in 1844 and the Birmingham School of Art from 1848 to 1852, before studying theology at Exeter College, Oxford. At Oxford, he became a friend of William Morris as a consequence of a mutual interest in poetry. The two Exeter undergraduates, together with a group of Jones&#x27; friends from Birmingham known as the Birmingham Set, formed a society, which they called &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;. The members of the brotherhood read the works of John Ruskin and Tennyson, visited churches, and idealised aspects of the aesthetics and social structure of the Middle Ages. At this time, Burne-Jones discovered Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; which would become a substantial influential in his life. At that time, neither Burne-Jones nor Morris knew Dante Gabriel Rossetti personally, but both were much influenced by his works, and later met him by recruiting him as a contributor to their &quot;Oxford and Cambridge Magazine&quot;, founded by Morris in 1856 to promote the Brotherhood’s ideas.

Burne-Jones had intended to become a church minister, but under Rossetti&#x27;s influence both he and Morris decided to become artists, and Burne-Jones left college before taking a degree to pursue a career in art. In February 1857, Rossetti wrote to William Bell Scott:
==Marriage and family==
In 1856 Burne-Jones became engaged to Georgiana &quot;Georgie&quot; MacDonald (1840–1920), one of the MacDonald sisters. She was training to be a painter, and was the sister of Burne-Jones&#x27;s old school friend. The couple married on 9 June 1860, after which she made her own work in woodcuts, and became a close friend of George Eliot. (Another MacDonald sister married the artist Sir Edward Poynter, a further sister married the ironmaster Alfred Baldwin and was the mother of the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, and yet another sister was the mother of Rudyard Kipling. Kipling and Baldwin were thus Burne-Jones&#x27;s nephews by marriage).

Georgiana gave birth to a son, Philip, in 1861. In the winter of 1864, she became gravely ill with scarlet fever and gave birth to a second son, Christopher, who died soon thereafter. The family then moved to 41 Kensington Square, and their daughter Margaret was born there in 1866. 

In 1867 Burne-Jones and his family settled at the Grange, an 18th-century house set in a garden in North End, Fulham, London. For the 1870s Burne-Jones did not exhibit, following a number of bitterly hostile attacks in the press, and a passionate affair (described as the &quot;emotional climax of his life&quot;) with his Greek model Maria Zambaco, which ended with her trying to commit suicide by throwing herself into Regent&#x27;s Canal. 

During these difficult years, Georgiana developed a friendship with Morris, whose wife Jane had fallen in love with Rossetti. Morris and Georgie may have been in love, but if he asked her to leave her husband, she refused. In the end, the Burne-Joneses remained together, as did the Morrises, but Morris and Georgiana were close for the rest of their lives.

In 1880, the Burne-Joneses bought Prospect House in Rottingdean, near Brighton in Sussex, as their holiday home and soon after, the next door Aubrey Cottage to create North End House, reflecting the fact that their Fulham home was in North End Road. (Years later, in 1923, Sir Roderick Jones, head of Reuters, and his wife, playwright and novelist Enid Bagnold, were to add the adjacent Gothic House to the property, which became the inspiration and setting for her play &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot;).

His troubled son Philip, who became a successful portrait painter, died in 1926. His adored daughter Margaret (died 1953) married John William Mackail (1850–1945), the friend and biographer of Morris, and Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1911 to 1916. Their children were the novelists Angela Thirkell and Denis Mackail, and the youngest, Clare Mackail. 

In an edition of the boys&#x27; magazine, Chums (No. 227, Vol.  V, 13 January 1897), an article on Burne-Jones stated that &quot;...his pet grandson used to be punished by being sent to stand in a corner with his face to the wall. One day on being sent there, he was delighted to find the wall prettily decorated with fairies, flowers, birds, and bunnies. His indulgent grandfather had utilised his talent to alleviate the tedium of his favourite&#x27;s period of penance.&quot;

==Artistic career==

===Early years: Rossetti and Morris===

Burne-Jones once admitted that after leaving Oxford he &quot;found himself at five-and-twenty what he ought to have been at fifteen&quot;. He had had no regular training as a draughtsman and lacked the confidence of science. But his extraordinary faculty of invention as a designer was already ripening; his mind, rich in knowledge of classical story and medieval romance, teemed with pictorial subjects, and he set himself to complete his set of skills by resolute labour, witnessed by his drawings. The works of this first period are all more or less tinged by the influence of Rossetti; but they are already differentiated from the elder master&#x27;s style by their more facile though less intensely felt elaboration of imaginative detail. Many are pen-and-ink drawings on vellum, exquisitely finished, of which his &quot;Waxen Image&quot; (1856) is one of the earliest and best examples. Although the subject, medium and manner derive from Rossetti&#x27;s inspiration, it is not the hand of a pupil merely, but of a potential master. This was recognised by Rossetti himself, who before long avowed that he had nothing more to teach him.

Burne-Jones&#x27;s first sketch in oils dates from this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College the first of what was to be an immense series of cartoons for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the &quot;Prioress&#x27;s Tale&quot; from Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with endless subjects. Thus early, therefore, we see the artist busy in all the various fields in which he was to labour.

In the autumn of 1857 Burne-Jones joined Morris, Valentine Prinsep, J. R. Spencer Stanhope and others in Rossetti&#x27;s ill-fated scheme to decorate the walls of the Oxford Union. None of the painters had mastered the technique of fresco, and their pictures had begun to peel from the walls before they were completed. In 1859 Burne-Jones made his first journey to Italy. He saw Florence, Pisa, Siena, Venice and other places, and appears to have found the gentle and romantic Sienese more attractive than any other school. Rossetti&#x27;s influence persisted and is visible, more strongly perhaps than ever before, in the two watercolours of 1860, &quot;Sidonia von Bork&quot; and &quot;Clara von Bork.&quot; Both paintings illustrate the 1849 gothic novel &quot;Sidonia the Sorceress&quot; by Lady Wilde, a translation of &quot;Sidonia Von Bork: Die Klosterhexe&quot; (1847) by Johann Wilhelm Meinhold.

===Painting===
In 1864, Burne-Jones was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water-Colours—which is known as the Old Water-Colour Society—and exhibited, among other works, &quot;The Merciful Knight&quot;, the first picture which fully revealed his ripened personality as an artist. The next six years saw a series of fine watercolours at the same gallery.

In 1866, Mrs. Cassavetti commissioned Burne-Jones to paint her daughter, Maria Zambaco, in &quot;Cupid finding Psyche&quot;, an introduction which led to their tragic affair. In 1870, Burne-Jones resigned his membership following a controversy over his painting &quot;Phyllis and Demophoön&quot;.&quot; &quot;The features of Maria Zambaco were clearly recognisable in the barely draped Phyllis, and the undraped nakedness of Demophoön coupled with the suggestion of female sexual assertiveness offended Victorian sensibilities. Burne-Jones was asked to make a slight alteration, but instead &quot;withdrew not only the picture from the walls, but himself from the Society&quot;. During the next seven years, 1870–1877, only two works of the painter&#x27;s were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the Dudley Gallery at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly in 1873, one of them being the beautiful &quot;Love Among the Ruins&quot;, destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed it to be an oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This silent period was one of unremitting production. 

Hitherto, Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in watercolours. He now began pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having them on hand. The first &quot;Briar Rose&quot; series, &quot;Laus Veneris,&quot; the &quot;Golden Stairs,&quot; the &quot;Pygmalion&quot; series, and &quot;The Mirror of Venus&quot; are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during these years. 

The beginnings of Burne-Jones&#x27; partnership with the fine-art photographer Frederick Hollyer, whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose an audience to Burne-Jones&#x27;s works in the coming decades, began during this period.

At last, in May 1877, the day of recognition came with the opening of the first exhibition of the Grosvenor Gallery, when the &quot;Days of Creation,&quot; &quot;The Beguiling of Merlin,&quot; and the &quot;Mirror of Venus&quot; were all shown. Burne-Jones followed up the signal success of these pictures with &quot;Laus Veneris,&quot; the &quot;Chant d&#x27;Amour,&quot; &quot;Pan and Psyche,&quot; and other works, exhibited in 1878. Most of these pictures are painted in brilliant colours. 

A change is noticeable in 1879 in the &quot;Annunciation&quot; and in the four pictures making up the second series of &quot;Pygmalion and the Image&quot;; the former of these, one of the simplest and most perfect of the artist&#x27;s works, is subdued and sober; in the latter, a scheme of soft and delicate tints was attempted, not with entire success. A similar temperance of colours marks &quot;The Golden Stairs,&quot; first exhibited in 1880. 

The almost sombre &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; was shown in 1883, followed in 1884 by &quot;King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid,&quot; in which Burne-Jones once more indulged his love of gorgeous colour, refined by the period of self-restraint. He next turned to two important sets of pictures, &quot;The Briar Rose&quot; and &quot;The Story of Perseus,&quot; although these were not completed.

===Decorative arts===

In 1861, William Morris founded the decorative arts firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co. with Rossetti, Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown and Philip Webb as partners, together with Charles Faulkner and Peter Paul Marshall, the former of whom was a member of the Oxford Brotherhood, and the latter a friend of Brown and Rossetti. The prospectus set forth that the firm would undertake carving, stained glass, metal-work, paper-hangings, chintzes (printed fabrics), and carpets. The decoration of churches was from the first an important part of the business. The work shown by the firm at the 1862 International Exhibition attracted notice, and later it was flourishing. Two significant secular commissions helped establish the firm&#x27;s reputation in the late 1860s: a royal project at St. James&#x27;s Palace and the &quot;green dining room&quot; at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert) of 1867 which featured stained glass windows and panel figures by Burne-Jones.

In 1871 Morris &amp; Co. were responsible for the windows at All Saints, designed by Burne-Jones for Alfred Baldwin, his wife&#x27;s brother-in-law. The firm was reorganised as Morris &amp; Co. in 1875, and Burne-Jones continued to contribute designs for stained glass and later tapestries until the end of his career. Nine windows designed by him and made by Morris &amp; Co were installed in Holy Trinity Church in Frome. 
Stained glass windows in the Christ Church cathedral and other buildings in Oxford are by Morris &amp; Co. with designs by Burne-Jones. 
Other windows are in St. Philip&#x27;s Cathedral, Birmingham, Church of St Editha, Tamworth, Salisbury Cathedral, St Martin in the Bull Ring, Birmingham, Holy Trinity Church, Sloane Square, Chelsea, St Peter and St Paul parish church in Cromer, St Martin&#x27;s Church in Brampton, Cumbria (the church designed by Philip Webb), St Michael&#x27;s Church, Brighton, Trinity Church in Frome, All Saints, Jesus Lane, Cambridge, St Edmund Hall, St Anne&#x27;s Church, Brown Edge, Staffordshire Moorlands, Kelvinside Hillhead Parish Church, Glasgow and St Edward the Confessor church at Cheddleton Staffordshire.

Stanmore Hall was the last major decorating commission executed by Morris &amp; Co. before Morris&#x27;s death in 1896. It was the most extensive commission undertaken by the firm, and included a series of tapestries based on the story of the Holy Grail for the dining room, with figures by Burne-Jones.

In 1891 Jones was elected a member of the Art Workers Guild.

===Illustration===
Although known primarily as a painter, Burne-Jones was active as an illustrator, helping the Pre-Raphaelite aesthetic to enter mainstream awareness. He designed books for the Kelmscott Press between 1892 and 1898. His illustrations appeared in the following books, among others:

* &quot;The Fairy Family&quot; by Archibald MacLaren (1857)
* &quot;The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; by William Morris (1872)
* &quot;The Earthly Paradise&quot; by William Morris (not completed)
* &quot;The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer (1896)
* &quot;Bible Gallery&quot; by Dalziel (1881)

===Design for the theatre===
In 1894, theatrical manager and actor Henry Irving commissioned Burne-Jones to design sets and costumes for the Lyceum Theatre production of &quot;King Arthur&quot; by J. Comyns Carr, who was Burne-Jones&#x27;s patron and the director of the New Gallery as well as a playwright. The play starred Irving as King Arthur and Ellen Terry as Guinevere, and toured America following its London run. Burne-Jones accepted the commission with enthusiasm, but was disappointed with much of the final result. He wrote confidentially to his friend Helen Mary Gaskell (known as May), &quot;The armour is good—they have taken pains with it ... Perceval looked the one romantic thing in it ... I hate the stage, don&#x27;t tell—but I do.&quot;

===Aesthetics===

Burne-Jones&#x27;s paintings were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued as an object of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways, this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites. Burne-Jones&#x27;s aim in art is best given in his own words, written to a friend:

I mean by a picture a beautiful, romantic dream of something that never was, never will be – in a light better than any light that ever shone – in a land no one can define or remember, only desire – and the forms divinely beautiful – and then I wake up, with the waking of Brynhild.

===Final years===

Burne-Jones was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1885, and the following year he exhibited uniquely at the Academy, showing &quot;The Depths of the Sea,&quot; a painting of a mermaid carrying down with her a youth whom she has unconsciously drowned in the impetuosity of her love. This picture adds to the habitual haunting charm a tragic irony of conception and a felicity of execution which give it a place apart among Burne-Jones&#x27;s works. He formally resigned his Associateship in 1893. 

One of the &quot;Perseus&quot; series was exhibited in 1887 and two more in 1888, with &quot;The Brazen Tower,&quot; inspired by the same legend. In 1890 the second series of &quot;The Legend of Briar Rose&quot; were exhibited by themselves and won admiration. The huge watercolour, &quot;The Star of Bethlehem,&quot; painted for the corporation of Birmingham, was exhibited in 1891. 

A long illness for a time checked the painter&#x27;s activity, which, when resumed, was much occupied with decorative schemes. An exhibition of his work was held at the New Gallery in the winter of 1892–1893. To this period belong his comparatively few portraits.

In 1894, Burne-Jones was made a baronet. Ill health again interrupted the progress of his works, chief among which was the vast &quot;Arthur in Avalon&quot;. William Morris died in 1896, and the health of Burne-Jones declined substantially after. In 1898 he suffered an attack of influenza, and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill and died on 17 June 1898. His memorial service was held six days later, at Westminster Abbey. His ashes were interred in the churchyard at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Rottingdean, a place he knew through summer family holidays. In the winter following his death, a second exhibition of his works was held at the New Gallery, and an exhibition of his drawings at the Burlington Fine Arts Club.

==Honours==

In 1881 Burne-Jones received an honorary degree from Oxford, and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1882. In 1885 he became the President of the Birmingham Society of Artists. At about that time, he began hyphenating his name, merely—as he wrote later—to avoid &quot;annihilation&quot; in the mass of Joneses. In November 1893, he was approached to see if he would accept a Baronetcy on the recommendation of the outgoing Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone, the following February he legally changed his name to Burne-Jones. He was formally created a baronet of Rottingdean, in the county of Sussex, and of the Grange, in the parish of Fulham, in the county of London, in the baronetage of the United Kingdom on 3 May 1894, but remained unhappy about accepting the honour, which disgusted his socialist friend Morris and was scorned by his equally socialist wife Georgiana. Only his son Philip, who mixed with the set of the Prince of Wales and would inherit the title, truly wanted it. Burne-Jones was made an elected member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium in 1897.

Following Burne-Jones&#x27; death, and at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, his memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an artist had been so honoured.

==Influence==
Burne-Jones exerted a considerable influence on French painting. He was influential among French symbolist painters, from 1889. His work inspired poetry by Algernon Charles Swinburne – Swinburne&#x27;s 1866 &quot;Poems &amp; Ballads&quot; is dedicated to Burne-Jones.

Three of Burne-Jones&#x27;s studio assistants, John Melhuish Strudwick, T. M. Rooke and Charles Fairfax Murray, went on to successful painting careers. Murray later became an important collector and respected art dealer. Between 1903 and 1907 he sold a great many works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, at far below their market worth. Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery now has the largest collection of works by Burne-Jones in the world, including the massive watercolour &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot;, commissioned for the Gallery in 1897. The paintings are believed by some to have influenced the young J. R. R. Tolkien, then growing up in Birmingham.

Burne-Jones was also a very strong influence on the Birmingham Group of artists, from the 1890s onwards.

==Neglect and rediscovery==
On 16 June 1933, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, a nephew of Burne-Jones, officially opened the centenary exhibition featuring Burne-Jones&#x27;s drawings and paintings at the Tate Gallery in London. In his opening speech at the exhibition, Baldwin expressed what the art of Burne-Jones stood for:

But, in fact, long before 1933, Burne-Jones had fallen out of fashion in the art world, much of which soon preferred the major trends in Modern art, and the exhibit marking the 100th anniversary of his birth was a sad affair, poorly attended. It was not until the mid-1970s that his work began to be re-assessed and once again acclaimed, following the publication of Martin Harrison and Bill Waters&#x27; 1973 monograph and reappraisal &#x27;Burne-Jones&#x27;. In 1975, author Penelope Fitzgerald published a biography of Burne-Jones, her first book. A major exhibit in 1989 at the Barbican Art Gallery, London (in book form as: John Christian, &quot;The Last Romantics&quot;, 1989), traced Burne-Jones&#x27;s influence on the subsequent generation of artists, and another at Tate Britain in 1997 explored the links between British Aestheticism and Symbolism.

A second, lavish centenary exhibit – this time marking the 100th anniversary of Burne-Jones&#x27;s death – was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1998, before travelling to the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris.

Fiona MacCarthy, in a review of Burne-Jones&#x27;s legacy, notes that he was &quot;a painter who, while quintessentially Victorian, leads us forward to the psychological and sexual introspection of the early twentieth century&quot;.

<text>The Eton wall game is a game that originated at and is still played at Eton College. It is played on a strip of ground 5 metres wide and 110 metres long (&quot;The Furrow&quot;) next to a slightly curved brick wall (&quot;The Wall&quot;) erected in 1717. It is one of two codes of football played at Eton, the other being the Eton field game.

The traditional and most important match of the year is played on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, as the Collegers (King&#x27;s Scholars) take on the Oppidans (the rest of the school). Although College has only 70 boys to pick from, compared to the 1250 or so Oppidans, the Collegers have one distinct advantage: access to the field on which the wall game is played is controlled by a Colleger. Despite this, it is usual for them to allow the Oppidans to use it whenever they wish.

At the annual St Andrew&#x27;s Day match, the Oppidans climb over the wall, after throwing their caps over in defiance of the Scholars, while the Collegers march down from the far end of College Field, arm-in-arm, towards the near end, where they meet the Oppidans.

The wall game is also played on Ascension Day, immediately after a 6 a.m. service on the roof of College Chapel. Various scratch matches are also played throughout the Michaelmas and Lent halves (terms), where boys from different year groups, as well as masters, take part.

==History==

The wall against which the game is played was constructed in 1717. According to an 1868 article, the Wall Game &quot;used formerly to be played in [a playing area with a width of] twenty yards, with the field rules in use, only with the exception that the ball used frequently to be held against the wall, and the goals were, at one end a door, at the other a tree. However, the distance from the wall where &#x27;the [boundary] line&#x27; was made became &#x27;fine by degrees and beautifully less,&#x27; and it is now only six yards from the wall&quot;.
A possible early reference to the wall game occurs in the anonymously-published reminiscences of Henry John Blake (born 1791). Blake reports that he was &quot;going away with the ball in style towards the goal, a large tree&quot; when he was fouled by an opponent.

Between 1811 and 1822, &quot;[f]ootball was almost confined to the Wall game, and at most forty players, mostly constant&quot;, although there were also &quot;occasional trifling games in the open [i.e., the Field game], rare in interval and rare in players&quot;.
A letter from March 1821 states &quot;there is a wall ... against which they play Foot-ball in the season; indeed they say it is capital weather for it now, but it is not the fashionable game, so nobody dares to propose it.&quot;

The Collegers v. Oppidans match was banned in 1827 for ten years after a fight broke out during the game. It had resumed by 1836.

An article on &quot;Eton games&quot; in the 19 November 1832 issue of the Eton College magazine includes a detailed description of the wall game (called simply &quot;Foot-ball&quot;). It notes that the game was already played &quot;in a space not more than five or six yards wide&quot;.
The 29 November 1840 issue of &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot; features a description of &quot;the annual match ... between Collegers and Oppidans&quot; played on 24 November 1840: 
the Collegers won by seven &quot;shies&quot;, with no goal being scored by either side. The article adds that this was &quot;the first time since 1836 that the Oppidans have been beaten&quot;.

The rules of the Wall Game were first written down in 1849. They were subsequently revised in 1862, 1871, and 1953. Eton College archives possess copies of the rules from 1885 and 1933. The 16th revision of the rules was made in 2001.

==Scoring==
The aim of the game is to move the ball towards the opponents&#x27; end of the playing area. In those last few yards of the field is an area called the &quot;calx&quot;. In this area a player can earn a &quot;shy&quot; (worth one point) by lifting the ball against the wall with his foot. A teammate then touches the ball with his hand and shouts &quot;Got it!&quot; These two plays must happen within the calx. After this, if the umpire says &quot;Given&quot;, the scoring team can attempt a goal (worth a further nine points) by throwing the ball at a designated target (a garden door at one end of the field and a tree at the other end). A player can also score a kicked goal, worth five points, if he kicks the ball out and it hits a goal during the normal course of play.

==Play==
The main game consists of the two sets of players forming a rugby-style scrummage (called a &quot;Bully&quot;) in which neither team may &quot;furk&quot; the ball, which is to hook it backwards (except in Calx, where a different type of Bully called a Calx Bully occurs). The Bully is formed next to the Wall and crabs slowly along the Wall until the ball emerges. Many players, particularly those whose position is actually against the Wall, lose the skin off their elbows, hips and knees. Because of this, players usually wear long sleeves. Players within the Bully shove and push each other, mostly with their bodies but also by placing their fists against the faces of the opposition and attempting to lever them backwards and away from the Wall. Actual punching is not permitted, and grabbing an opponent&#x27;s shirt (&quot;holding&quot;) is also not allowed.

The fastest way to make ground is by kicking the ball upfield and out of play whenever it comes sideways out of the Bully; unlike most types of football, play is restarted opposite where the ball stops after it had gone out, or was touched after it had gone out.

Consequently, the most common tactic revolves around the formation of a &#x27;phalanx&#x27;. This consists of a tunnel (coming out from the wall, diagonally forward from the position of the ball) of players from one team who are crouching on hands and feet next to each other. Once the team in possession of the ball has formed a successful phalanx, it attempts to pass the ball down the &#x27;tunnel&#x27; using the knees of the players forming it, to a player standing at the end of the phalanx (i.e. furthest away from the Wall), known as Lines, whose job it is to kick the ball upfield. The team not in possession is constantly attempting to disrupt this, and win the ball back.

The game lasts up to 55 minutes, with two halves of 25 minutes each and an additional 5 minutes as half-time break. Many games end 0-0. Goals (worth ten points) are very rare; they occur about once every couple of years, and no goals have been scored in the St Andrew&#x27;s Day game since 1911, when future Prime Minister Harold MacMillan scored. However, shies (worth 1 point) are scored more frequently.

==Positions==
Each team has ten players and two substitutes:
*Second: Player on the Ball
*Second: Player on the Ball
*Third: Player supporting Player on the Ball
*Fourth: Player outside Third
*First Wall: Standing player stopping progress of opposition Second 
*Second Wall: Standing player preventing opposition First Wall from disrupting his First Wall’s actions
*Third Wall: Supports Second Wall
*Lines: Calls offences and kicks ball when loose
*Fly: Organises bully&#x27;s actions and tells team where the ball is
*Long: Stands many yards behind the bully, to stop the ball if it gets past his bully, like a Goalkeeper in Association Football.
*Blood Sub: Comes on if any of his team bleeds
*12th Man: Tactical substitution that may be used at any point

==Organisation==
The Wall Game is organised entirely by boys, particularly by the Keepers (captains) of College Wall, Oppidan Wall and Mixed Wall. Famous past players of the Wall Game include Prince Harry who played for the Oppidans, Boris Johnson (Keeper of the College Wall), George Orwell and Harold Macmillan. The First World War flying ace Arthur Rhys Davids also played, representing College with Ralph Dominic Gamble in 1915.

There are organised sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Lent half, by the Master in Charge. 

Members of the College Wall also annually commemorate the outstanding player and Keeper of the Wall Logie Leggatt, who was killed in the First World War at the age of 22, making a toast at each year&#x27;s Christmas Sock Supper with the words &quot;in piam memoriam L.C.L&quot; (in affectionate memory of L.C.L). Despite its renown outside the school, only a very small number of the 250 or so boys in each year group ever take part in the sport, unlike the lesser-known but much more widely played Eton field game.

The Eton Wall Game has been played twice by all-female teams, including in 2005.

==In popular culture==
The game was first televised by the BBC in 1948.

The sitcom &quot;Green Wing&quot; features a fictional game, Guyball (), which parodies the obscurity of public school pastimes such as the Eton wall game. It is introduced by Guy Secretan, who learned the sport at the fictional school Whiteleaf (). The object of the game is to throw balls in a &quot;Topmiler&quot;, a wicker basket on top of a leather flying helmet. However, the rules of Guyball are never fully explained and are designed to be as confusing and as difficult to understand as possible. Fans of the show have however created their own rules, and the game was occasionally played &#x27;for real&#x27;.

In Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld series, the Ankh-Morpork Assassins&#x27; Guild has a far more sadistic variant of the &quot;Wall Game&quot;, and is essentially an extreme hybrid of rock-climbing and dodgeball.

In the first of Charlie Higson&#x27;s Young Bond novels, &quot;SilverFin&quot;, the young James Bond comes to Eton and learns the rules of the Wall Game.

The game was a subject of the 1987 book, &quot;The Sports Hall of Shame&quot;, by Bruce Nash and Allan Zullo.

The game is mentioned in the novels
&quot;The Bancroft Strategy&quot;,
&quot; The Cobra&quot;,
&quot;The IPCRESS File&quot;, and &quot;Burma Sahib&quot;.

<doc id="178879" wikidata="Q202420" url="?curid=178879" title="Cesare Lombroso">
<text>Cesare Lombroso ( , ; ; born Ezechia Marco Lombroso; 6 November 1835 – 19 October 1909) was an Italian eugenicist, criminologist, phrenologist, physician, and founder of the Italian school of criminology. He is considered the founder of modern criminal anthropology by changing the Western notions of individual responsibility.

Lombroso rejected the established classical school, which held that crime was a characteristic trait of human nature. Instead, using concepts drawn from physiognomy, degeneration theory, psychiatry, and Social Darwinism, Lombroso&#x27;s theory of anthropological criminology essentially stated that criminality was inherited, and that someone &quot;born criminal&quot; could be identified by physical (congenital) defects, which confirmed a criminal as savage or atavistic.

== Early life and education ==
Lombroso was born in Verona, Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, on 6 November 1835 to a wealthy Jewish family. His father was Aronne Lombroso, a tradesman from Verona, and his mother was Zeffora (or Zefira) Levi from Chieri near Turin. Cesare Lombroso descended from a line of rabbis, which led him to study a wide range of topics in university. He studied literature, linguistics, and archæology at the universities of Padua, Vienna, and Paris. Despite pursuing these studies in university, Lombroso eventually settled on pursuing a degree in medicine, which he graduated with from the University of Pavia.

==Career==

Lombroso initially worked as an army surgeon, beginning in 1859 when he enlisted as a volunteer. He claimed that he developed the theory of atavistic criminality during this period. In 1866, he was appointed visiting lecturer at Pavia, and later took charge of the insane asylum at Pesaro in 1871. His research into the bodily characteristics of soldiers and asylum inmates became the foundation of his work on criminal anthropology. He became professor of forensic medicine and hygiene at Turin in 1878. That year he wrote his most important and influential work, &quot;L&#x27;uomo delinquente&quot; (&quot;Criminal Man&quot; in English), which went through five editions in Italian and was published in various European languages.

Three of his works had been translated into English by 1900, including a partial translation of &quot;The Female Offender&quot; published in 1895 and read in August of that year by the late nineteenth-century English novelist George Gissing (1857-1903).

Lombroso became a professor of psychiatry (1896) and of criminal anthropology (1906) at Turin University.

==Personal life and final years==
Lombroso married Nina de Benedetti on 10 April 1870. They had five children together, one of whom—Gina—would go on to publish a summary of Lombroso&#x27;s work after his death. 

He died in Turin in 1909.

== Concept of criminal atavism ==

 Lombroso&#x27;s general theory suggested that criminals are distinguished from noncriminals by multiple physical anomalies. He postulated that criminals represented a reversion to a primitive or subhuman type of person characterized by physical features reminiscent of apes, lower primates, and early humans and to some extent preserved, he said, in modern &quot;savages&quot;. The behaviour of these biological &quot;throwbacks&quot; will inevitably be contrary to the rules and expectations of modern civilized society.

Through years of postmortem examinations and anthropometric studies of criminals, the insane, and normal individuals, Lombroso became convinced that the &quot;born criminal&quot; (&quot;reo nato&quot;, a term given by Ferri) could be anatomically identified by such items as a sloping forehead, ears of unusual size, asymmetry of the face, prognathism, excessive length of arms, asymmetry of the cranium, and other &quot;physical stigmata&quot;. Specific criminals, such as thieves, rapists, and murderers, could be distinguished by specific characteristics, he believed. Lombroso also maintained that criminals had less sensitivity to pain and touch; more acute sight; a lack of moral sense, including an absence of remorse; more vanity, impulsiveness, vindictiveness, and cruelty; and other manifestations, such as a special criminal argot and the excessive use of tattooing. 
Besides the &quot;born criminal&quot;, Lombroso also described &quot;criminaloids&quot;, or occasional criminals, criminals by passion, moral imbeciles, and criminal epileptics. He recognized the diminished role of organic factors in many habitual offenders and referred to the delicate balance between predisposing factors (organic, genetic) and precipitating factors such as one&#x27;s environment, opportunity, or poverty.

In &quot;Criminal Woman&quot;, as introduced in an English translation by Nicole Hahn Rafter and Mary Gibson, Lombroso used his theory of atavism to explain women&#x27;s criminal offending. In the text, Lombroso outlines a comparative analysis of &quot;normal women&quot; as opposed to &quot;criminal women&quot; such as &quot;the prostitute.&quot; However, Lombroso&#x27;s &quot;obdurate beliefs&quot; about women presented an &quot;intractable problem&quot; for this theory: &quot;Because he was convinced that women are inferior to men Lombroso was unable to argue, based on his theory of the born criminal, that women&#x27;s lesser involvement in crime reflected their comparatively lower levels of atavism.&quot;

Lombroso&#x27;s research methods were clinical and descriptive, with precise details of skull dimensions and other measurements. He did not engage in rigorous statistical comparisons of criminals and non-criminals. Although he gave some recognition in his later years to psychological and sociological factors in the etiology of crime, he remained convinced of and identified with, criminal anthropometry. After he died, his skull and brain were measured according to his own theories by a colleague as he requested in his will; his head was preserved in a jar and is still displayed with his collection at the Museum of Psychiatry and Criminology in Turin.

Lombroso&#x27;s theories were disapproved throughout Europe, especially in schools of medicine: notably by Alexandre Lacassagne in France. His notions of physical differentiation between criminals and non-criminals were seriously challenged by Charles Goring (&quot;The English Convict&quot;, 1913), who made elaborate comparisons and found insignificant statistical differences.

== Legacy ==

Self-proclaimed the founder of modern scientific psychiatry, Lombroso is purported to have coined the term &quot;criminology&quot;. He institutionalized the science of psychiatry in universities. His graduating thesis from the University of Pavia dealt with &quot;endemic cretinism&quot;. Over the next several years, Lombroso&#x27;s fascination with criminal behaviour and society began, and he gained experience managing a mental institution. After a brief stint in the Italian army, Lombroso returned to the University of Pavia and became the first professor specializing in mental health. By the 1880s, his theories had reached the pinnacle of their fame, and his accolades championed them throughout the fields dedicated to examining mental illness. Lombroso differentiated himself from his predecessor and rival, Cesare Beccaria, by depicting his positivist school in opposition to Beccaria&#x27;s classist one (which centred around the idea that criminal behaviour is born out of free will rather than inherited physical traits). Lombroso&#x27;s psychiatric theories were conglomerated and collectively called the positivist school by his followers, which included Antonio Marro and Alfredo Niceforo. Ideas similar to Lombroso&#x27;s assessment of white and northern-European supremacy over other races would be used by fascists to gird, for example, the promulgation of Italian racial laws. His school of thought was only truly abandoned in Italian universities&#x27; curriculum after World War II.

Through his various publications, Lombroso established a school of psychiatry based on biological determinism and the idea that mental illness was via genetic factors. A person&#x27;s predisposition to mental illness was determinable through his appearance, as explained in the aforementioned criminal atavism segment. Lombroso&#x27;s theory has been cited as possibly &quot;the most influential doctrine&quot; in all areas studying human behaviour, and indeed, its impact extended far and wide. According to Lombroso, criminal appearance was not just based on inherited physiognomy such as nose or skull shape, but also could be judged through superficial features like tattoos on the body. In particular, Lombroso began searching for a relationship between tattoos and an agglomeration of symptoms eut (which are currently diagnosed as borderline personality disorder). He also believed that tattoos indicated a certain type of criminal.

Through his observations of sex workers and criminals, Lombroso hypothesized a correlation between left-handedness, criminality, and degenerate behaviour. He also propagated the idea that left-handedness leads to other disabilities, by linking left-handedness with neurodegeneration and alcoholism. Lombroso&#x27;s theories were likely accepted due to the pre-existing regional stigma against left-handedness, and greatly influenced the reception of left-handedness in the 20th century. His hypothesis even manifested in a new way during the 1980s and 1990s with a series of research studies grouping left-handedness with psychiatric disorders and autoimmune diseases.

Despite his stance on inherited immorality and biologically destined criminal behaviour, Lombroso believed in socialism and supposedly sympathized with the stigmatization of lower socioeconomic statuses, placing him at odds with the biological determinism he espoused. His work stereotyping degenerates can even be seen as an influence behind Benito Mussolini&#x27;s movement to clean the streets of Italy. Many adherents to Lombroso&#x27;s positivist school stayed powerful during Mussolini&#x27;s rule, because of the seamless way criminal atavism and biological determinism justified both the racial theories and eugenic tendencies of fascism. However, certain legal institutions did press back against the idea that criminal behaviour is biologically determined.

Within the penal system, Lombroso&#x27;s work led to new forms of punishment, where occasionally punishment varied based on the defendant&#x27;s biological background. There are a few instances in which case the physiognomy of the defendant actually mattered more than witness testimony and the defendant was subjected to harsher sentences.

During the period in Italy between the 1850s and 1880s, the Italian government debated legislation for the insanity plea. Judges and lawyers backed Beccaria&#x27;s classist school, tending to favour the idea that wrongdoers are breaking a societal contract with the option to exercise free will, tying into Beccaria&#x27;s classist school of social misbehaviour. Lombroso and his followers argued for a criminal code, in which the criminal was understood as unable to act with free will due to their biological predisposition to crime.

Since his research tied criminal behaviour together with the insane, Lombroso is closely credited with the genesis of the criminally insane asylum and forensic psychiatry. His work sponsored the creation of institutions where the criminally insane would be treated for mental illness, rather than placed in jails with their saner counterparts. One example of an asylum for the criminally insane is Bridgewater State Hospital, which is located in the United States. Other examples of these institutions are Matteawan State Hospital and Danvers State Hospital. Most have closed down, but the concept is kept alive with modern correctional facilities like Cook County Jail. This facility houses the largest population of prisoners with mental illness in the United States. However, criminal insane asylums did exist outside of Italy while Lombroso was establishing them within the country. His influence on the asylum was at first regional, but eventually percolated to other countries who adopted some of Lombroso&#x27;s measures for treating the criminally insane.

In addition to influencing criminal atavism, Lombroso wrote a book called &quot;Genio e Follia&quot;, in which he discussed the link between genius and insanity. He believed that genius was an evolutionarily beneficial form of insanity, stemming from the same root as other mental illnesses. This hypothesis led to his request to examine Leo Tolstoy for degenerate qualities during his attendance at the 12th International Medical Congress in Moscow in 1897. The meeting went poorly, and Tolstoy&#x27;s novel &quot;Resurrection&quot; shows great disdain for Lombroso&#x27;s methodology.

Towards the end of his life, Lombroso began to study pellagra, a disease which Joseph Goldberger simultaneously was researching, in rural Italy. He postulated that pellagra came from a nutrition deficit, officially proven by Goldberger. This disease also found its roots in the same poverty that caused cretinism, which Lombroso studied at the start of his medical career. Furthermore, before Lombroso&#x27;s death, the Italian government passed a law in 1904 standardizing treatment in mental asylums and codifying procedural admittance for mentally ill criminals. This law gave psychiatrists free rein within the criminally insane asylum, validating the field of psychiatry by giving the psychiatrists the sole authority to define and treat the causes of criminal behaviour (a position which Lombroso argued for from his early teaching days to his death).

== &quot;The Man of Genius&quot; ==
Lombroso believed that genius was closely related to madness. In his attempts to develop these notions, while in Moscow in 1897 he travelled to Yasnaya Polyana to meet Leo Tolstoy in hopes of elucidating and providing evidence for his theory of genius reverting or degenerating into insanity.

Lombroso published &quot;The Man of Genius&quot; in 1889, a book which argued that artistic genius was a form of hereditary insanity. In order to support this assertion, he began assembling a large collection of &quot;psychiatric art&quot;. He published an article on the subject in 1880 in which he isolated thirteen typical features of the &quot;art of the insane.&quot; Although his criteria are generally regarded as outdated today, his work inspired later writers on the subject, particularly Hans Prinzhorn.

Lombroso&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Genius&quot; provided inspiration for Max Nordau&#x27;s work, as evidenced by his dedication of &quot;Degeneration&quot; to Lombroso, whom he considered to be his &quot;dear and honored master&quot;. In his exploration of geniuses descending into madness, Lombroso stated that he could only find six men who did not exhibit symptoms of &quot;degeneration&quot; or madness: Galileo, Da Vinci, Voltaire, Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Darwin. By contrast, Lombroso cited that men such as Shakespeare, Plato, Aristotle, Mozart and Dante all displayed &quot;degenerate symptoms&quot;. In order to classify geniuses as &quot;degenerate,&quot; or insane, Lombroso judged each genius by whether they exhibited &quot;degenerate symptoms,&quot; such as precocity, longevity, versatility and inspiration. Lombroso supplemented these psychological observations with skeletal and cranial measurements, including facial angles, &quot;abnormalities&quot; in bone structure, and volumes of brain fluid. Measurements of skulls taken included those from Immanuel Kant, Alessandro Volta, Ugo Foscolo, and Ambrogio Fusinieri. Lombroso&#x27;s reference to skull measurements was inspired by the phrenological work and research of German doctor Franz Joseph Gall. In commenting on skull measurements, Lombroso made observations such as, &quot;I have noted several characters which anthropologists consider to belong to the lower races, such as prominence of the styloid apophysis&quot;. This observation was recorded in response to his analysis of Alessandro Volta&#x27;s skull. Lombroso connected geniuses to various health disorders as well, by listing signs of degeneration in chapter two of his work, some of which include abnormalities and discrepancies in height and pallor. Lombroso listed the following geniuses, among others, as &quot;sickly and weak during childhood&quot;: Demosthenes, Francis Bacon, Descartes, Isaac Newton, John Locke, Adam Smith, Robert Boyle, Alexander Pope, John Flaxman, Nelson, Albrecht von Haller, Körner and Blaise Pascal. Other physical afflictions that Lombroso associated with degeneracy included rickets, emaciation, sterility, lefthandedness, unconsciousness, stupidity, somnambulism, smallness or disproportionality of the body, and amnesia. In his explanation of the connection between genius and the &quot;degenerative marker&quot; of height, Lombroso cites the following people: Robert and Elizabeth Browning, Henrik Ibsen, George Eliot, Thiers, Louis Blanc and Algernon Charles Swinburne, among others. He continues by listing the only &quot;great men of tall stature&quot; that he knows of, including Petrarch, Friedrich Schiller, Foscolo, Bismarck, Charlemagne, Dumas, George Washington, Peter the Great, and Voltaire. Lombroso further cited certain personality traits as markers of degeneracy, such as &quot;a fondness for special words&quot; and &quot;the inspiration of genius&quot;.

Lombroso&#x27;s methods and explanations in &quot;The Man of Genius&quot; were rebutted and questioned by the American Journal of Psychiatry. In a review of &quot;The Man of Genius&quot; they stated, &quot;Here we have an hypothesis claiming to be the result of strict scientific investigation and reluctant conviction, bolstered by half-told truths, misrepresentations and assumptions.&quot; Lombroso&#x27;s work was also criticized by Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi, who, in his review of Lombroso&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Genius&quot;—and specifically his classifications and definitions of &quot;the genius&quot;—stated, &quot;By creating a genius according to his own fancy, an ideal and abstract being, and not by examining the personality of a real living genius, he naturally arrives at the conclusion that all theories by which the origin of genius is sought to be explained on a basis of observation, and especially that particular one which finds in degeneration the cause or one of the causes of genius, are erroneous.&quot; Sergi went on to state that such theorists are &quot;like the worshippers of the saints or of fetishes, who do not recognize the material from which the fetish is made, or the human origin from which the saint has sprung&quot;.

== Spiritualism ==
Later in his life Lombroso began investigating mediumship. Although originally sceptical, he later became a believer in spiritualism. As an atheist Lombroso discusses his views on the paranormal and spiritualism in his book &quot;After Death – What?&quot; (1909) which he believed the existence of spirits and claimed the medium Eusapia Palladino was genuine. The article &quot;Exit Eusapia!&quot; was published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; on 9 November 1895. The article questioned the scientific legitimacy of the Society for Psychical Research for investigating Palladino a medium who had a reputation of being a fraud and imposter and was surprised that Lombroso had been deceived by Palladino.

The anthropologist Edward Clodd wrote &quot;[Lombroso] swallowed the lot at a gulp, from table raps to materialisation of the departed, spirit photographs and spirit voices; every story, old or new, alike from savage and civilised sources, confirming his will to believe&quot;. Lombroso&#x27;s daughter Gina Ferrero wrote that during the later years of his life, Lombroso suffered from arteriosclerosis and his mental and physical health was wrecked. The sceptic Joseph McCabe wrote that because of this it was not surprising that Palladino managed to fool Lombroso into believing spiritualism by her tricks.

== Literary impact ==

Historian Daniel Pick argues that Lombroso serves &quot;as a curious footnote to late-nineteenth-century literary studies&quot;, due to his referencing in famous books of the time. Jacques in Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;The Beast Within&quot; is described as having a jaw that juts forward on the bottom. It is emphasized especially at the end of the book when he is overwhelmed by the desire to kill. The anarchist Karl Yundt in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;, delivers a speech denouncing Lombroso. The assistant prosecutor in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot; uses Lombroso&#x27;s theories to accuse Maslova of being a congenital criminal, and in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, Count Dracula is described as having a physical appearance Lombroso would describe as criminal. In Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1955 James Bond novel &quot;Moonraker&quot;, Bond mockingly describes the villainous, facially scarred Hugo Drax as a man with whom Lombroso would have been delighted.

<doc id="178880" wikidata="Q1028279" url="?curid=178880" title="Cambridge, Ontario">
<text>Cambridge is a city in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, located at the confluence of the Grand and Speed rivers. The city had a population of 138,479 as of the 2021 census. Along with Kitchener and Waterloo, Cambridge is one of the three core cities of Canada&#x27;s tenth-largest metropolitan area.

Cambridge was formed in 1973 by the amalgamation of Galt, Preston, Hespeler, the settlement of Blair, North Dumfries, as well as east and west Galt. The former Galt covers the largest portion of Cambridge, making up the southern half of the city, while Preston and Blair cover the western side. Hespeler makes up the most northeastern section of Cambridge. Historical information and records of each entity are well documented in the Cambridge City Archives.

==History==
The area today known as Ontario has been inhabited by Indigenous peoples since end of the last Ice Age. In the south of Cambridge when preparing for building townhouses near Myers Road in 1989, archaeologists discovered the ruins of a longhouse village dated to between 1280 and 1360 CE. They may have practiced slash and burn agriculture (as was common in the Northeastern Woodlands since 1000 CE) cultivating the Three Sisters and could have been occupied by the Iroquoian speaking Chonnonton Peoples. In the late 17th century, the Algonkian speaking Anishinaabe and Mississauga peoples moved into the territory of southern Ontario.

===History of the City of Galt===

Galt is situated on land once granted to the Iroquois people by the British Crown at the end of the American Revolutionary War. In the late 1700s, developers began to buy land around the Grand River from the Six Nations who were led by Joseph Brant. One speculator, William Dickson, a wealthy immigrant from Scotland, bought of land along the Grand River in 1816; this was later to become Galt and the Dumfries Townships. Dickson divided the land and sold smaller lots, particularly to Scottish settlers. The centre of the planned community was built at the junction of Mill Creek and the Grand River, then called Shade&#x27;s Mills.

Dickson decided to name the Post Office Galt, in honour of John Galt of the Canada Company which was developing this entire area. Primarily agricultural in early years, Galt had attracted industry by 1840 and became the largest town in the Grand River area until the early 1900s. The town continued to grow, however, based on a large industrial base. In fact, Galt was called &quot;Manchester of Canada&quot; because of the extensive industry, powered by the Grand River. Some of the important businesses in about 1870 included the Dickson Mills (opened in 1843), the Axe Factory forge, two furniture factories, The Dumfries iron and brass foundry, three large woolen factories, a malt factory, the Victoria Steam Carriage Works, the Dumfries Flour Mill, the Victoria Foundry making farm implements, a large soap and candles works and two steam-powered tanneries.

Records from 1846 indicate that Galt had very valuable water-power that allowed for milling and manufacturing. Stone buildings in the downtown area had already been erected and the population was 1,000, most of whom were originally from Scotland. Amenities included a curling club, library, a weekly newspaper, a school, a bank (Gore) and a fire company. The post office was receiving daily mail. Industries included two grist mills, two saw mills, two foundries, two carding machines and cloth factories, one brewery, two distilleries, one tannery, eight stores, nine taverns, two grocery stores and various tradesmen.

The largest of the early schools in the community, the Galt Grammar School, opened in 1852 with the Dubliner William Tassie as headmaster starting in 1853 at the site of what later became the Galt Collegiate. The school gained widespread recognition and attracted students from across North America. By 1872, it had been recognized as a Collegiate Institute.

Galt was incorporated as a town on January 1, 1857, with Morris C. Lutz elected as the first mayor. By 1858, a &quot;Town Hall and Market House&quot; had been built with an &quot;Italianate&quot;, particularly Tuscan, influence. In later years, the building became the City Hall and was extensively modified. Throughout that entire period, it continued to grow based on a large industrial base.

The railway reached Galt in 1879, increasing the opportunities of exporting local goods and importing others. The Credit Valley Railway planned to implement several lines running west and north from Toronto and in 1873, built freight and passenger buildings in Galt. By 1879, the company had installed a bridge crossing the river and in December completed a preliminary test run with a train; it was successful. The CVR venture was not long-lived, however, and in 1883, the line was taken over by the Canadian Pacific Railway, which built a brick passenger building that still stands.

The first hospital in Waterloo County opened in 1890 as Galt General Hospital. Additional buildings and facilities were added in the early 1900s. By 1918, the facility had an X-ray room, a 27-room nurses&#x27; residence, and also served as a nurses&#x27; training school.

A new streetcar system, the Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway, (later called the Grand River Railway Company) also began to operate in 1894, connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover. The electric rail system ended passenger services in April 1955.

Galt was incorporated as a city in 1915 and continued to grow due to a large industrial base.

In 1911, most of the population of Galt were Protestant: 4,240 Presbyterians, 1,930 Anglicans, and 2,122 Methodists. There were very few Roman Catholics.

Not long after Galt had become part of Cambridge, in May 1974, flooding on the Grand River filled city streets with water to a depth of about . In some areas of the downtown core, the depth was , smashing windows and carrying goods along the streets. Approximately 75 businesses were affected, with virtually none covered by relevant insurance. The flood caused an estimated $5 million in damage.

The Dickson Hill Heritage Conservation District, located in West Galt, is composed of stately homes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===History of the Town of Preston===


Preston was formed on land belonging to the German Company Tract, along the Speed River, which was purchased earlier from the Six Nations Indians. The name Preston is from the hometown of William Scollick, who was surveyor and a native of Preston, Lancashire in England.

In the 1800s a group of German-speaking Mennonites from Pennsylvania arrived in the area and purchased land. Among the first settlers to arrive in what was later to become Preston was John Erb, a Mennonite from Lancaster County, who arrived in 1805. He bought including land at the confluence of the Grand and Speed Rivers in what later became Preston. and later built a sawmill in 1806 and a gristmill in 1807. This settlement became known as Cambridge Mills.

Even in the early 1800s, the area included homes, a store, an inn, small shops operated by artisans and craftsmen, mostly immigrants from Germany. The Erb sons had hired William Scollick for their development business and the latter completed a full survey in 1834; he also convinced the Erbs to rename the Cambridge Mills area Preston. After Erb&#x27;s death in 1832, a son sold off property on both sides of the Speed River. What eventually became Preston started as a large settlement on the north side.

There were only 250 inhabitants in 1836, many from Pennsylvania, but the population had reached about 1600 by 1855, with some 70% originally from Germany. By then, the area had eight hotels and taverns.

The Canadian Gazetteer of 1846 indicates a population of about 600 inhabitants, two churches, a post office that receives mail each day, a steam grist mill, and tradesmen of various types. At the time, there was no significant industry.

The Preston post office opened in 1837 and the population continued to grow primarily because of immigration from Germany. Preston was incorporated as a village in 1853. The population declined in the late 1800s but by 1900, it had increased to 2,000 partly because of the new electric railway systems that started in 1894. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover. This made visiting other communities and carrying of goods very convenient.

Due to continued growth, by 1879 there were many industries such as a foundry, carriage manufacturer, potteries and a furniture company. This was also the year that the Cherry Flour Mills started, which would later become the Dover Flour Mills, a Preston company that still operates today.

By 1888, the Preston Springs Hotel, then called the Del Monte Hotel, was operating. Demolition of the building began in December 2020 for reasons of public safety. 
On September 30, 1899, Preston was incorporated as a town with a population of just under 11,000. The Great Road between Dundas and Berlin (Kitchener) as well as the railroad connections helped the community to continue growing into an important industrial centre. Products made here included flour, agricultural implements, furniture, stoves, shoes and textiles. Preston grew and continued to be a successful industrial area; expansion followed in the 1950s and 1960s.

While most of the population of what became Waterloo County, Ontario was Protestant in 1911, Preston had a larger share of Roman Catholics, 844, while 862 were Lutherans, 707 Methodists, 704 Anglicans, and 525 Presbyterians.

===History of the Town of Hespeler===

The area that eventually came to be Hespeler was also on land (Block 2 measuring over purchased in 1798 by Mennonites from Pennsylvania from the Six Nations Indians with the assistance of developer Richard Beasley. The first of settler, in 1809, was Abraham Clemens who had bought of land from Mr. Beasley on the Speed River. In 1810, Cornelius Pannabecker arrived and set up a blacksmithy a year or two later. Twenty years later, Joseph Oberholtzer purchased a much larger area of land that would become the early Hespeler. It was named Bergeytown in honour of his brother-in-law and the name became New Hope in about 1835.
Settler Jacob Hespeler arrived in 1845 and bought a tract on the Speed River. He built an industrial complex that was the beginning of Hespeler&#x27;s future industrialization which would consist primarily of woollen and textile mills. Records from 1846 indicate a population of only 100 inhabitants, a grist and a saw mill, a tannery, a tavern, one store, one pail factory, two blacksmiths, two tailors, two shoemakers.

In 1858, Jacob Hespeler opened the Post Office and the settlement, previously called New Hope, was incorporated as the village of Hespeler.

The arrival of the railway in 1859 helped businesses to develop and prosper. By 1864, there was a large flour mill, cloth and wool manufacturing plants, a sawmill and a distillery all built of cut stone. There was also a large furniture factory and four churches.

Continued growth allowed Hespeler to be incorporated as a town in January 1901. Over the following years, the community continued growing slowly. By 1911 the electric railway system between Preston and Galt had reached Hespeler as well as Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover.

Textile production mills were the primary industry in the early 1900s and continued to be successful until the late 1940s, when this industry began to decline. Other industries continued to boom and by 1969, Hespeler&#x27;s population was 6,000.

===History of the Village of Blair===

The land (west of what is now Preston), including Carolinian forest, that would eventually become Blair was purchased from the Six Nations, through land speculator Richard Beasley. It was settled in 1800 by Samuel D. Betzner, one of the Mennonites from Pennsylvania. The group later discovered that Beasley had gotten into financial trouble and that a lien was placed on the lands. To solve the problem, the group created the German Company that bought an additional 60,000 acres of land from Beasley, who used the proceeds to pay off the debt on the previous lands. This ensured a clear title for the Mennonite group.

The first school in what later became Waterloo County opened in 1802 near Blair, then known as Shinglebridge. The first teacher&#x27;s name was Mr. Rittenhaus.

By 1804, the first cemetery in Waterloo County had been founded. Also located in Blair, it is often referred to as the Old Blair Cemetery or the Old Blair Memorial Cemetery. The first recorded burial was of an infant, the son of Mennonite settler John Bricker, who died on March 10 of that year.

Joseph Bowman, a man called Wismer and John Bechtel were responsible for the early development of the community in an area laid out by Benjamin B. Bowman. They built a dam, then a sawmill and grist mill. In 1846, a large flour mill opened, which was called the Bowman Mill, Blair Mill and also the Carlisle Mill. In about 1876, a 15-horsepower hydroelectric system, the Sheave Tower, was built on Bowman Creek by Allan Bowman to help power the flour mill using a series of shafts and gears. This was a significant achievement in that era.

Although the name Carlisle (or New Carlisle) was commonly used then, the name Blair was chosen for the first post office in 1858 because a village of Carlisle had already been established in Halton County. The new name honoured Adam Johnston Fergusson Blair, the first judge of Wellington District and a militia colonel in the area. In addition to Carlisle, earlier names for the village had included Shinglebridge, because a bridge with a shingle roof crossed the Grand River in this area from 1853 to 1857. It was also called Durham (or Durhamville) and Lambs&#x27; Bridge.

By 1864, the settlement was receiving mail daily, had a large school, a Mennonite meeting house, a large brick church and a population of 200. Railway service arrived in Blair in 1873 when the Grand Trunk Railway, having acquired the Great Western Railway&#x27;s defunct Preston and Berlin Railway, rerouted it through Blair on its way to Galt, bypassing Preston, the railway&#x27;s original destination.

Blair became part of Preston in 1969. Many historic buildings still stand in the village, including some from the early 1820s. This includes the Sheave Tower (restored in 1999) and the John Bechtel residence.

===Galt, Preston and Hespeler Electric Railway===
A new electric street railway system, the Galt, Preston and Hespeler Street Railway (later called the Grand River Railway Company) began to operate in 1894, initially connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Berlin (later called Kitchener) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover. The electric rail system ended passenger services in April 1955. The light rail transit plan for the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, decades later, would be reminiscent of the original Electric Railway.

==Government==
The first mayor of Cambridge, taking office as of the city&#x27;s creation in 1973, was Claudette Millar. Most recently, Kathryn McGarry was elected in the 2018 municipal election to succeed Doug Craig as the city&#x27;s sixth mayor, taking office on December 1, 2018.

Cambridge City Council consists of the mayor and eight councillors, each representing a ward.

A referendum question asking municipal electors if they wished to change to ranked voting was approved on October 23, 2018.

In 2020, Scott Hamilton was elected in a by-election for Ward 7 to replace Councillor Frank Monteiro who passed while serving the community.

City councillors by ward:
* Ward 1: Donna Reid
* Ward 2: Mike Devine
* Ward 3: Mike Mann
* Ward 4: Jan Liggett
* Ward 5: Pam Wolf
* Ward 6: Shannon Adshade
* Ward 7: Scott Hamilton
* Ward 8: Nicholas Ermeta
Cambridge is also represented on the higher-tier Waterloo Regional Council which consists of the regional chair, the mayors of the seven cities and townships, and eight additional councillors - four from Kitchener and two each from Cambridge and Waterloo. Ken Seiling has held the position of regional chair from 1985-November 30, 2018. In the 2018 Region of Waterloo elections, Karen Redman was elected as Regional Chair.

The City of Cambridge is represented by:
* Cambridge Mayor Kathryn McGarry
* Regional Councillor Karl Kiefer
* Regional Councillor Helen Jowett

Cambridge (federal electoral district) is represented in Ottawa by Bryan May (Liberal), the federal member of Parliament who defeated the previous incumbent MP (Gary Goodyear, Conservative – 2004 to 2015) in the October 2015 election. The second federal representative for Cambridge is Valerie Bradford (Liberal), who represents the federal riding of Kitchener South—Hespeler.

The MPP for the provincial district of Cambridge is Brian Riddell (Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario), who defeated New Blue Party of Ontario co-founder Belinda Karahalios in 2022. The second provincial representative for Cambridge is Jess Dixon (Progressive Conservative), who represents the provincial riding of Kitchener South—Hespeler.

==Municipal services==
The city is responsible for Community Services, Economic Development, Transportation &amp; Public Works, Corporate Services, Fire Department and Planning Services. Many municipal services are provided through the Regional Municipality of Waterloo (often referred to as Waterloo Region or the Region of Waterloo), which consists of the cities of Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo, and the townships of Woolwich, Wilmot, Wellesley, and North Dumfries. The region of Waterloo responsibilities includes Social Services, Community Health Services, Grand River Transit and Community Policing through Waterloo Regional Police Service.

===Hospital===
Hospital services are provided by Cambridge Memorial Hospital at 700 Coronation Boulevard. A small hospital in the Galt area had opened in 1890, the first in Waterloo County, while the current facility, originally named South Waterloo Memorial Hospital, was completed in 1953. It was expanded in the early 1970s with the addition of Wing B, the inpatient tower. This facility began a $187 million expansion project in 2014 that was expected to be completed by 2019. The hospital summarized the plan as follows in 2013: &quot;This transformation includes a larger Emergency Department and a 33% increase in beds to accommodate expanded mental health, medicine, surgery, birthing programs and so much more&quot;.

Difficulties with the general contractor, Bondfield Construction, which eventually went into receivership, delayed the process significantly. A news report on 29 December 2018 stated that &quot;After two decades of planning and community fundraising, the expansion project, promising 54 new beds and a twice-as-large emergency department, is not quite half-complete and stalled&quot;. A consortium of banks, led by the receiver, the Bank of Montreal, called on the contractor&#x27;s insurer, Zurich, to activate its surety bond. That step provided the funding to continue work on the new wing to correct the many deficiencies; the process was moving slowly as of late April 2019. At that time, Infrastructure Ontario, Zurich Insurance Company and the project lenders were in discussions with a contractor who will be hired to renovate the existing B wing after the new wing is occupied. An estimate in late 2018 indicated that the completion date for the entire hospital project was 2021 at the earliest.
Part of the hospital expansion, the new patient care wing, was completed in mid-November 2019 and was scheduled to open in January 2020, after new equipment has been installed and staff have been trained.

==Climate==
The climate in Cambridge is typical of southwestern Ontario, and has a humid continental climate under the Köppen climate classification (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with mostly moderate winters but the occasional deep freeze. In summer, the temperatures tend to be in the high twenties on the Celsius scale, and like most of southern Ontario, there can be stretches of high humidity creating some discomfort. On most days, Cambridge tends to be slightly warmer than Kitchener and Guelph, just to the north.

The last frost date of the season is around May 11, though most gardeners plant on the May 24 long weekend to be safe. Environment Canada issues frost warnings for the area from October 30 through to May 9.

==Economy==
In 1988, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada opened a plant in Cambridge, which employs approximately 4,500 people and is the city&#x27;s largest employer. Several other industrial companies also have locations in Cambridge, including Rimowa, Gerdau, ATS Automation Tooling Systems, Loblaw Companies Limited, Dare Foods, Frito-Lay Canada (formerly Hostess), Babcock &amp; Wilcox, Rockwell Automation and COM DEV International in addition to service companies such as Coronation Dental Specialty Group.

The city encourages the filming of movie and TV productions and many have done location work here. Filmmakers come to the city for the European architecture and proximity to Toronto. Cambridge has become more &quot;film-friendly&quot; and has an increase in filmmakers coming to the city, with 15 projects filmed in 21 days in 2016. According to an interview with the &quot;Cambridge Record&quot;, Devon Hogue, economic development officer with the City of Cambridge noted what draws filmmakers: &quot;First and foremost, they come for the river... Once they are here, they fall in love with the built architecture. That&#x27;s not something you can get very easily in Toronto or Hamilton.&quot; In 2016, filming in Cambridge contributed $1.2 million to the economy and Hogue states that: &quot;Seeing Cambridge on the screen creates a sense of community pride.&quot; Notable films shot in Cambridge include &quot;John Q&quot; (2002), &quot;Red&quot; (2010), &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation&quot; (2012) and &quot;Flatliners&quot; (2017). Notable television series filmed in Cambridge include &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; (2008–), &quot;Between&quot; (2015–2016), &quot;Bitten&quot; (2014–2016), &quot;11.22.63&quot; (2016), &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2017–), &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; (2016–), V-Wars (2019–), The October Faction (2019–) and &quot;American Gods&quot; (2017–). In 2019, Cambridge was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Film Office&quot; by the Location Manager&#x27;s Guild International for their work on &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale.&quot; This was the first time in the history of the award that a Canadian office was nominated.

==Education==

English-language public schooling is provided by the Waterloo Region District School Board, which operates 26 elementary and five secondary schools in Cambridge. Public high schools in the city include the 165-year-old Galt Collegiate Institute and Vocational School; Preston High School, Glenview Park Secondary School; Southwood Secondary School; and Jacob Hespeler Secondary School.

Publicly funded Catholic education is available through schools operated by the Waterloo Catholic District School Board. The WCDSB runs 15 elementary and two secondary schools in the city: St. Benedict Catholic Secondary School &amp; Monsignor Doyle Catholic Secondary School. Cambridge is also home to École secondaire Père-René-de-Galinée, the only French-language Catholic high school in the region. There are also a number of private elementary and secondary schools in the area.

The University of Waterloo School of Architecture campus is located in Cambridge in the Riverside Silk Mill, also known as the Tiger Brand Building. Inside there is a theatre, a fitness room, and the gallery &quot;Design at Riverside&quot;, which is one of two publicly funded galleries dedicated to architecture in Canada. The School of Architecture is home to 380 students who live, study, and learn within the Cambridge community.

In 2009, Conestoga College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning set up a new School of Engineering Technology specializing in advanced technology programs related to Robotics, Process Automation, Electronics, Communications, Engineering, and Information Technology. With over of applied learning and research space.

An announcement in mid-December 2019 indicated that Conestoga College had decided to purchase 42 acres of land in this city with the intention of relocating all of the trades and apprenticeship programs (offered at various other campuses) to Cambridge at a future date. Specifics were not immediately provided.

==Attractions==

Cambridge is home to many cultural events and activities, including the Mill Race Festival and the Rock the Mill music festivals in downtown Galt, and the Cambridge Highland Games in Churchill Park in July. There is also the Cambridge Butterfly Conservatory, the annual dragon boat festival, the Cambridge fall fair, and the Santa Claus Parade.

There is also the festive &quot;Christmas in Cambridge&quot; winter festival at Christmas featuring events like Unsilent Night, which began in New York City by Phil Kline. The City of Cambridge&#x27;s take on this event uniquely involves other aspects of the community such as Christie digital projection technology. University of Waterloo School of Architecture Cambridge students in Dr. Jeff Lederer&#x27;s Urban Revitalization and Design class designed the spectacular light installations.

The Cambridge Farmers&#x27; Market has been in operation in the original building on the original site circa 1830; making it the third-oldest market in the country. The Cambridge Farmers&#x27; Market is now ranked as one of the top 10 markets in the country by &quot;Best Health Magazine&quot;. All the vendors come from within a 100 km radius to sell fresh fruits, cheese, vegetables, baked goods and more.

The Cambridge Centre of the Arts is a municipally operated community arts centre that is available to area residents, artists and organizations. The Arts Centre was opened in May 2001. Cambridge Galleries are a part of the Cambridge Public Library system or Idea Exchange, with art exhibition spaces at Queen&#x27;s Square, Preston and the new Design at Riverside location. Together, the three galleries host approximately 23 exhibitions per year. Along with the art gallery projects, Cambridge Libraries (Idea Exchange) are undergoing a $13.5 million restoration project of a former post-office into a digital library. The building was unused for some time before the city bought it for $950,000 and a Parks Canada grant of $800,000 restored some of the building. The new project will not house physical print but focus on 3D &amp; laser printers, maker labs, performance and studio for teen, a large children&#x27;s area including a Lego wall and a coffee shop.

The Federal and Ontario governments and the City of Cambridge came together and built the Dunfield Theatre in 2013 in an effort to promote Canadian talent and the performing arts. The 59,000-square-foot arts complex boasts 500 seats and over $20 million was contributed/donated. Michael Chan Minister of Tourism, Culture, and Sport said of the theatre&#x27;s construction:&quot;Arts and culture help to stimulate the economy, draw visitors to our province and enhance our quality of life...The new Dunfield Theatre Cambridge will enrich the cultural fabric of this community and provide exciting opportunities for people to engage in the arts. The Ontario government is pleased to support such a worthy project.&quot; In 2018, the theatre&#x27;s name was changed to the Hamilton Family Theatre.

In June 2008, the new Cambridge City Hall facility opened as the first city hall in Canada to achieve the ranking of gold in the LEED from the Canada Green Building Council. The $30 million project was completed on time and on budget and financed through a settlement of a loan with the city&#x27;s hydro utility. A conservative estimate comparing a standard building to the new City Hall LEED-standard building results in a $160,000 savings on energy per year or some $1.6 million over 10 years. The open concept of the facility allows for greater airflow, reducing cooling costs and increasing the penetration of natural light to offset other light sources. A four-story &quot;living wall&quot; of tropical plants is located in the atrium and cleanses the air of pollutants such as formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds, dust, and spores. Behind the living wall is a running water supply that provides humidity during the winter months and a soothing sound for employees and visitors to enjoy all year round.

The historic city hall in Cambridge was built in 1858 by local architect H.B. Sinclair for $3,650, replacing the original structure built in 1838. Built of granite and white limestone, locally found blue granite was used as a decorative feature. The Historic City Hall served as the community&#x27;s town hall and marketplace. Today, the Historic City Hall and the New City Hall are connected by a hallway constructed shortly after the New City Hall was built.

In the tradition of environmental stewardship, Cambridge preserves over of parkland which make up more than 80 parks in the city, as well as over of on-road cycling lanes.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cambridge had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

At the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in the 2021 census, the Kitchener - Cambridge - Waterloo CMA had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2021, the median age was 39.2 years, lower than the provincial median age of 41.6 years. 17.7% of the population was under 15 years of age and 16% was 65 years and over.

=== Ethnicity ===

According to the 2021 census, the population of Cambridge was approximately 74.3% White, 23.9% visible minority and 1.9% Indigenous. The largest visible minority group, at 11.7% of the population, was South Asian, followed by Black (3.6%), Latin American (1.7%), Filipino (1.3%), Southeast Asian (1.2%), Arab (1.1%), and Chinese (0.9%).

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

=== Religion ===
As of 2021, 54.6% of the population identify as Christian (down from 69.6% in 2011). Others identify as Muslim (6.8%), Sikh (2.9%), Hindu (2.9%), and Buddhist (0.7%). 31.4% of the population report no religious affiliation, up from 24% in 2011

==Transport==

===Roads===
There are two main arterial roads that form an &#x27;X&#x27; through the city. The intersecting point is colloquially referred to as the Delta. The intersection was once known as Hunter&#x27;s Corners. The Delta is adjacent to a Canadian Pacific Rail spur and the Babcock &amp; Wilcox plant, and at peak rush hour times traffic would back up for miles radiating outwards from the Delta. A number of strategies were investigated to alleviate delays caused by trains and as of December 2012 construction of a bridge over Hespeler Road commenced, and was completed 18 months later. While this eliminated delays caused by trains, the Delta remains a very busy intersection. Multiphase traffic signals with restrictions on right turns on red constrain vehicular throughput compared to typical signalized intersections. Highway 8 (Ontario) travels through the city as Shantz Hill Road, King Street in Preston, Coronation Boulevard, and Dundas Street, linking Cambridge to Kitchener and Waterloo in the west, and Hamilton in the east. Highway 24 runs through Cambridge as Hespeler Road, Water Street, and Ainslie Street, connecting to Guelph in the northeast and Brantford in the south.

===Bridges===
Cambridge has some of the most historic bridges in Waterloo Region. The Black Bridge Road Bridge (1916) is Cambridge&#x27;s only truss bridge and has been designated a heritage site since 1997. It is still driven upon, though it is prone to major flooding and subsequent closure in the spring. The Main Street Bridge (1931) is a bowstring arch bridge made of concrete and is set over the Grand River. Also in Cambridge is the Park Hill Road Bridge (2002), formally known as the Queen Street Bridge (1933). This bridge was one of the three bridges credited with contributing to the development of early Galt. The bridge was reconstructed and widened to four lanes in 2002 retaining much of the original appearance. The Mill Creek Bridge (1837) in Cambridge is the oldest remaining bridge structure in the region and one of only two stone masonry arch bridges in the Region of Waterloo.

In 2007, the Region of Waterloo completed the first pedestrian/cycling bridge to cross the 401. This bridge connects Morningside Drive (Cambridge) with Doon Valley Drive (Kitchener) and is an integral part of the Grand River trails system.

===Public transportation===

Since 2000, public transport throughout the Region of Waterloo has been provided by Grand River Transit (GRT), which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit. GRT operates a number of routes in Cambridge that provide service within Cambridge itself and service to Kitchener &amp; Waterloo, including 1 Bus Rapid Transit line and 2 limited-stop express bus lines. Ainslie Street Terminal serves as the main transportation hub for Grand River Transit and Coach Canada, while Sportsworld GO serves as the primary transit hub for GO Transit in Cambridge.

Frequency of transit may vary between routes. Some routes like 51 Hespeler may provide faster &amp; more frequent service throughout the week, while routes like the 60 Burnett receive lower service and operate for lesser time.

Coach Canada runs almost every two hours during the daytime between Hamilton and Kitchener, and connecting to Niagara Falls.

===Railways===
The Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Galt Subdivision is the primary rail corridor in the city. It passes through the community of Galt, from which it takes its name, on an approximately east–west axis. It is a part of the Canadian Pacific mainline connecting Toronto with points southwest. Other cities on the Galt Subdivision (from east to west) are Toronto, Mississauga, and London; the line also passes through the towns of Milton and Woodstock.

Although freight trains serving the Toyota factory are a common sight in Cambridge, the city at present has no passenger rail service. , Cambridge is the only municipality in Ontario with both a population of over 100,000 people and no passenger rail service. The nearest Via Rail stations in the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor are Kitchener station, Guelph station, and Brantford.

The most easily accessible GO Transit railway stations are in Kitchener, Guelph and in Milton. GO bus service between Mississauga, Cambridge, and Kitchener was introduced in 2009 as a forerunner to GO train service to Kitchener.

====Light rail====

The first appearance of light rail in Cambridge was an electric street railway system between Galt and Preston, which was called the Galt and Preston Street Railway. This later expanded with a branch line from Preston to Hespeler, and was subsequently renamed the Galt, Preston and Hespeler Street Railway (GP&amp;H). A separate extension line, the Preston and Berlin Street Railway, was built and then merged with the GP&amp;H, and the whole system was renamed the Grand River Railway, which at its greatest extent ran as far north as Waterloo. With this extension, as well as infrastructure upgrades, it became a true interurban. A sister railway, the Lake Erie and Northern Railway, connected to the Grand River Railway at Galt, running south to Port Dover via Paris, Brantford, and Simcoe. The electric rail system ended passenger services in April, 1955.

In June 2011, the Waterloo regional council approved the plan for a light rail transit (LRT) service from Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo to Fairview Park Mall in south Kitchener, with express buses through to Cambridge. In Phase 1, which started operating in 2019, the Ion LRT runs between Waterloo and Kitchener, passing through the downtown and uptown areas of the two cities. The stations for the rapid buses along the southern half, known as Stage 2, were put in place by 2016.

Stage 2 of the rail line would run from to the &quot;downtown Galt&quot; area of Cambridge. At least one journalist has pointed out the similarity between this plan and the electric Grand River Railway of the early 1900s that connected Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo. Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig was a determined opponent of the plan. He felt that a series of buses would be just as effective but much less expensive.

The Ion rapid transit service in Kitchener-Waterloo (Stage 1) began on June 21, 2019, after delays caused by Bombardier&#x27;s late deliver of the trains needed for the service. Most of the rails had been installed by the end of 2016; the maintenance facility and all underground utility work had been completed. The start date of service was postponed to early 2018, however, because of delays in the manufacture and delivery of the vehicles by Bombardier Transportation. As of 24 February 2017, only a single sample of a train car had arrived for testing.

In late February 2017, plans for the Stage 2 (Cambridge section) of the Ion rail service were still in the very early stage; public consultations had just started at the time. Some routes and stops had been agreed upon in 2011, but the final plan will not be established until mid 2017. No estimated date has been published for the start of light rail service to Cambridge.

Until the completion of Stage 2, rapid transit is provided between Fairview Park Mall and the Ainslie Street Transit Terminal (in the downtown Galt area) using branded buses with WiFi. Other stops for this Ion bus are at Hespeler Road at the Delta, Can-Amera, Cambridge Centre, Pinebush, and Sportsworld. The ION bus provides a direct link to the LRT half of the system in Kitchener-Waterloo.

====GO train service proposals====
In the years following the discontinuance of all passenger rail service to Cambridge, municipal officials lobbied for its return. In 2013, then-mayor Doug Craig reported positive results from negotiations with the Ontario Ministry of Transportation around an extension of GO Transit&#x27;s Milton line service from its terminus at Milton; both Galt and Milton are located along the Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s Galt Subdivision, which Milton line trains use. Craig pointed to the number of existing GO bus riders in Cambridge, as well as the number of Cambridge residents driving to Milton or to Paris, the latter to board Via Rail intercity trains which could reach Toronto in around an hour. The full business case for the Milton line extension, entitled &quot;Cambridge on the GO&quot;, was released in 2015.

In 2018, citing the inability to successfully negotiate with Canadian Pacific for further access for passenger trains along the Galt Subdivision, regional and municipal governments, along with Metrolinx and the Ministry of Transportation, began to pursue a possible passenger rail connection to the Kitchener line at Guelph Central Station, using the existing CN Fergus Subdivision to reach it. An early 2021 report detailed the second stage of the feasibility study, which addressed details around service levels and station locations. The report proposed a service launch of 2026. Proposed train frequencies would be between one and four per hour, with travel times of around 15 minutes. Ridership estimates for 2026 would be 80,000–385,000 per year in different scenarios, dependent on the level of infrastructure investment in the line. The study estimated a lower cost and travel time to Toronto compared to driving directly or using existing GO or Via services; this differential was projected to increase approaching the mid-21st century, driven by road congestion and the effects of infrastructure investment on the Kitchener line, which would decrease train travel times. The study also argued that the service would aid in intensification of development in low-density areas of Cambridge, be highly deliverable due to its use of an existing rail corridor, and improve labour mobility and economic development in Southwestern Ontario. The preferred station location was at Pinebush, which is also planned to be an Ion LRT station, making direct transfers between the light rail system and Cambridge–Guelph trains possible. Cambridge city councillors responded to the report favourably, highlighting a positive response from constituents.

===Air===
The nearest airport to Cambridge is the Region of Waterloo International Airport in neighboring Breslau. While it is a thriving general aviation field, commercial airlines from this location serve few destinations. On 22 June 2016 American Airlines announced it would be suspending flights to Chicago from this airport effective 5 October 2016.

==Sports and recreation==
Cambridge has 365 ha of parkland, 99 parks, over 140 sports fields, and many golf courses. As well, the city has over 70 km of urban and natural trails, 18 km of which run along
the Grand and Speed Rivers.

===Teams===
The Cambridge Turbos are the most successful team in the National Ringette League with six titles at the Canadian Ringette Championships, including three straight from 2015 to 2017.

Cambridge is the home of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League&#x27;s Cambridge Redhawks (Previously The Cambridge Winter Hawks.) The Winter Hawks were the winners of the 2006 and 2007 Sutherland Cup. Cambridge also was the home of the four-time Allan Cup winning Cambridge Hornets of the Original OHA Senior A League, the last OHA Senior A Hockey League, and Major League Hockey. The team folded in 2006 following a points deduction by the Ontario Hockey Association for fielding an ineligible player, which caused the team to miss the playoffs. Following the dispute, the owners attempted to sell the team but were unsuccessful. Several attempts to revive the club have failed.

The Scorpions Youth Volleyball Club was formed in 2009 and has over 400 youth registered in their indoor and beach volleyball programs. The Scorpions have 8 competitive indoor teams. In September 2012 the Scorpions have the City of Cambridge 1st every boys competitive team (15U team) playing in the Ontario Volleyball Association. The club is a member of the Ontario Volleyball Association, with Learn to Play and House League programs for girls and boys Grades 3–12. They also have one of the largest youth beach volleyball programs in Ontario.

The Cambridge Aquajets are a competitive swim team that was founded in the early 1950s. The club practices at all of the City of Cambridge pools throughout the year.

The outstanding athletic achievement of individuals participating in sports has been honoured in Cambridge every November at the Cambridge Sports Awards banquet since 1974.

The Galt Red Wings were a junior ice hockey team based in Galt that played in the Ontario Hockey Association from 1944 to 1947. They were operated as an affiliate of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League. During the 1944–45 season, the Red Wings were led by Gordie Howe. They reached the league finals for the J. Ross Robertson Cup in 1945, but lost to Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s Majors in four games. Their home arena was the Galt Arena Gardens.

===Recreational buildings===
The City of Cambridge has 6 public skating arenas: Dickson Centre, Duncan McIntosh Arena, Galt Arena Gardens, Hespeler Memorial Arena, Karl Homuth Arena, and Preston Auditorium; and 2 private skating areas: Cambridge Ice Centre and Ice Park. As well, the city has 2 public indoor pools (John Dolson Centre and W.G. Johnson Centre) and 3 public outdoor pools (Edward Newland Pool, George Hancock Pool, and Kinsmen – Soper Pool), in addition to the indoor pool at the Chaplin Family YMCA.

Cambridge has one lawn bowling club: the Preston Lawn Bowling Club is on Queenston Road in the Preston area of the city.

On October 24, 2008, the city completed the COM DEV Indoor Soccer Park. The $2.8 million project was funded by the City of Cambridge, COM DEV, and the Cambridge Youth Soccer Club, and will help accommodate a large number of kids playing soccer in the Waterloo Region.

<text>Caroline B. Cooney (born May 10, 1947) is an American author of suspense, romance, horror, and mystery books for young adults.

==Biography==
Cooney was born in 1947 in Geneva, New York. She grew up in Old Greenwich, Connecticut. She attended Indiana University from 1965 to 1966, then went to Massachusetts General Hospital School of Nursing from 1966 to 1967. She went to the University of Connecticut in 1968. She attended several colleges but didn&#x27;t want to obtain a degree because of certain circumstances. She did not initially know she wanted to be a writer. Cooney took care of three children while writing after her first book got published. That&#x27;s when the books started getting published one after another.

Cooney&#x27;s books have received several honors, including an IRA–CBC Children&#x27;s Choice and being named an ALA Best Book for Young Adults. Most recently Cooney&#x27;s &quot;Diamonds in the Shadow&quot; was named a 2008 ALA/YALSA Quick Pick and was a nominee for the Edgar Allan Poe Award.

She currently resides in Rock Hill, South Carolina.

<text>Colm J. Meaney (; ; born 30 May 1953) is an Irish actor best known for playing Miles O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994) and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993–1999). He has guest-starred on many TV shows including &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and starred as Thomas C. Durant on &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; (2011–2016).

He has a career in films, appearing in &quot; Layer Cake&quot;, &quot;The Damned United&quot;, all three film adaptations of Roddy Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Barrytown Trilogy&quot;, and in &quot;Get Him to the Greek&quot;. He portrayed a principal character in the film &quot;The Englishman who Went up a Hill but Came down a Mountain&quot;. In 2017, Meaney won the Best Actor IFTA for his portrayal of Irish politician Martin McGuinness in the film &quot;The Journey&quot;. In 2020, he was listed at number 24 on &quot;The Irish Times&quot; list of Ireland&#x27;s greatest film actors.

==Early life==
Meaney was born and raised in Glasnevin, Dublin. He began studying acting at age 14, and he entered the Abbey Theatre School of Acting after secondary school. He became a member of the Irish National Theatre and worked for the next eight years in England, touring with several theatre companies, including the 7:84 theatre group founded by John McGrath.

==Career==
Meaney&#x27;s first television appearance was in &quot;Z-Cars&quot; on BBC One, in 1978. He guest-starred on shows such as &quot;Remington Steele&quot; and &quot;Moonlighting&quot; before embarking on a successful film career; he received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor for his role in &quot;The Snapper&quot;.

Meaney first appeared on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in its 1987 pilot episode, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, as an unnamed helm officer. His character became a frequently recurring one, and was given the name of Miles O&#x27;Brien as he became more prominent in the crew as Transporter Chief. In 1993, Meaney left &quot;The Next Generation&quot; for a main role in its spin-off &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and remained on that show until its final episode, in 1999. With 225 total appearances on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, he is second to Michael Dorn with the most appearances on the franchise.

Meaney played Colum O&#x27;Hara in the 1994 miniseries &quot;Scarlett&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. He has played a minor recurring role as Cowen, leader of the Genii on the series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, guest-starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; and appeared as Bob O&#x27;Donnell on the ABC show &quot;Men in Trees&quot;. Meaney appeared in the film &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, playing the pilot of the plane Windsor 114 that was later crashed by Colonel Stuart.

He was the only actor to appear in all three film adaptations of Roddy Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Barrytown Trilogy&quot;, as the father of the Rabbitte family. His stage appearances include the Old Vic production of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;A Moon for the Misbegotten&quot;. Meaney starred in the British comedy film &quot;Three and Out&quot; (released in the UK on 25 April 2008). In July of the same year An Post (the Irish Post Office) issued a postage stamp showing Meaney as Joe Mullen in the film &quot;Kings&quot;.

In 2009, Meaney co-starred with Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx in &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot;, playing Detective Dunnigan. In March 2009, Meaney voiced an Irish bartender on the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;In the Name of the Grandfather&quot;. In the same month the film &quot;The Damned United&quot; was released, a mostly fictional retelling of the 44-day period in which Brian Clough was manager of Leeds United F.C. Meaney played former Leeds manager Don Revie. He co-starred in &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot;. In 2013, Meaney co-starred in &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot;. In 2014, he appeared as The Horse in the BBC&#x27;s three-part crime story &quot;The Driver&quot;. For five seasons he portrayed railroad magnate Thomas C. Durant on AMC&#x27;s drama series &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;.

==Personal life==
Meaney married Irish actress Bairbre Dowling in 1977. Their daughter was born in 1984. The couple divorced in 1994. He married French costume designer Ines Glorian in March 2007. Their daughter was born in 2005. They live in the Majorcan town of Sóller.

Meaney is a supporter of Sinn Féin.

<doc id="178892" wikidata="Q1137587" url="?curid=178892" title="Coupling (British TV series)">
<text>Coupling is a British television sitcom written by Steven Moffat that aired on BBC Two and BBC Three from 12 May 2000 to 14 June 2004. Produced by Hartswood Films for the BBC, the show centres on the dating, sexual adventures, and mishaps of six friends in their early 30s, often depicting the three women and the three men each talking among themselves about the same events, but in entirely different terms.

The series was inspired by Moffat&#x27;s relationship with producer Sue Vertue, to the extent that they gave their names to two of the characters. &quot;Coupling&quot; is an example of the &quot;group-genre&quot;, an ensemble show that had proven popular at the time. Critics compared the show to the American sitcoms &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

The critical reaction was largely positive, and the show was named &quot;Best TV Comedy&quot; at the 2003 British Comedy Awards. The show debuted to unimpressive ratings, but its popularity soon increased, and by the end of the third series, the show had achieved respectable ratings in the UK. The series first aired on PBS stations and on BBC America in the United States beginning in late 2002 and quickly gained a devoted fanbase there, as well. The show is syndicated around the world. Short-lived American and Greek adaptations were briefly produced in 2003 and 2007, respectively. In a 2004 poll to find Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom, &quot;Coupling&quot; came in 54th.

==Production==

===Conception===
Moffat had used the breakdown of his first marriage as inspiration for his 1990s sitcom &quot;Joking Apart&quot;. Retaining this semiautobiographical trend, &quot;Coupling&quot; was based on him meeting his wife, Sue Vertue, and on the issues that arise in new relationships.

Moffat met Vertue at the Edinburgh International Television Festival in 1996. Vertue had been working for Tiger Aspect, a production company run by Peter Bennett-Jones. Bennett-Jones and his friend and former colleague Andre Ptaszynski, who had worked with Moffat on the sitcoms &quot;Joking Apart&quot; and &quot;Chalk&quot;, told Moffat and Vertue that each fancied the other. A relationship blossomed and they left their respective production companies to join Hartswood Films, run by Beryl Vertue, Sue&#x27;s mother. After production wrapped on &quot;Chalk&quot; in 1997, Moffat announced to the cast that he was marrying Vertue.

When she eventually asked him to write a sitcom for Hartswood, he decided to base it around the evolution of their own relationship. Drunk one evening, he went into her office, wrote the word &quot;Coupling&quot; on a sheet of paper and told her to ask him about it later.

The couple formed the basis for the main characters Steve and Susan. The four other characters are Steve and Susan&#x27;s best friends and last ex-relationships (one of each for both Steve and Susan). The fourth episode, &quot;Inferno&quot;, was written shortly after Vertue had found a similar tape in the VCR, although Moffat added the &#x27;spanking&#x27; element to the script as he &quot;didn&#x27;t think the real tape was quite pervy enough.&#x27;&quot;

The show used the &quot;group genre&quot;, a type of programme using ensemble casts that was proving popular, with then-recent successes as &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;This Life&quot; (also starring Davenport), and &quot;Cold Feet&quot;. Moffat feels the group genre reflects young people&#x27;s modern mores more so than traditional sitcoms, saying, &quot;Young people watch because it is the lifestyle which is just ahead of them and older people reminisce. &quot;Coupling&quot; is about two people who get together and bring with them baggage from their past, friends, and ex-partners - people who would never meet under normal circumstances. It deals in the kind of trivia people talk about, important questions like when should a man take off his socks during foreplay?&quot; Moffat believes group shows would not have been popular with earlier generations of television audiences, stating:

===Writing===

According to Vertue, Steven Moffat wrote on the top floor of their family home. Once he finished a script, she read it two floors away so he could not hear her laughing. The producer says that his first drafts were &quot;pretty much ready to shoot&quot;. She did not give him many notes; she would tick all of the places where she laughed, and then he revised the script accordingly.

The humour of the show, according to Moffat, is in the context. He says that there are &quot;no jokes &quot;per se&quot;&quot; and if they did put jokes in, they were normally taken out because they did not work. He found writing the show difficult at first because he was writing his own voice six times over, with none of the characteristics and inflections of the performers to inspire him.

Moffat used a range of styles and techniques, such as split screen and nonlinear narratives, that are unconventional in sitcoms. The first series episode &quot;The Girl with Two Breasts&quot;, in which half of the episode is in Hebrew, proved so popular that the producers tried to do something similar every series. Moffat says that the simplicity of the setting encouraged an &quot;epic, ridiculous way of telling an ordinary story.&quot; The opening episode of series three, &quot;Split&quot;, uses split screen to simultaneously depict what happens with Steve and Susan after separating. The series four opener, &quot;Nine and a Half Minutes&quot;, depicts the same events in the bar from three different perspectives.

===Rehearsals===
British sitcoms usually cannot afford to occupy a studio facility for the entire run, meaning that they are unable to rehearse in the studio. Rehearsals for &quot;Coupling&quot; took place in a church hall off Kensington High Street.

The actors received their scripts on Friday mornings. Following a read-through, Moffat was generally forced to cut minutes worth of material to achieve the requisite length. Director Martin Dennis designed and compiled the camera script on Saturday afternoons. After a day off on Sundays, the sets were erected for a producer&#x27;s run on Mondays, and then a technical run on Tuesdays. Much of Wednesdays was spent camera blocking, a process which regularly overran at the expense of a dress rehearsal.

As the actors became familiar with the material, they would sometimes develop a joke. However, according to Moffat, such elaboration could overcomplicate a joke for an audience coming to the material for the first time. Martin Dennis, according to Moffat, regularly told the actors, &quot;You know that funny thing you&#x27;re doing? Don&#x27;t do that&quot;. The director encouraged them to deliver their lines as well as they had in the original read-through.

===Recording===
All of the location sequences for each series were filmed in London during the first week of each production block. As Moffat was generally late delivering the final few scripts of each series, those episodes contained no location material. The exterior shots of the bar were filmed in Clerkenwell in the first series. After a nearby Thai restaurant complained that filming was disrupting their business, a street just off Tottenham Court Road was used from series two. The house in which Moffat and Vertue lived at the time was used as the exterior for Steve&#x27;s flat, with the surrounding area used for other sequences.

Material that was technically difficult was filmed the day before the recording with the live studio audience. A common example of this would be a dinner table sequence, where some characters would be filmed against the fourth wall, rather than the often-used contrived method of cramming everyone together around the proscenium. Readjusting the set and refilming against the fourth wall would have been too time-consuming. However, the absence of the studio audiences made it more difficult for the actors to judge the timing of the laughs. For instance, Moffat says that this prevented Gina Bellman from &quot;milking&quot; a particular laugh in the episode &quot;Dressed&quot;, an episode in which most of her scenes were prerecorded because she was wearing minimal clothing on set to provide the illusion of complete nudity. The prerecorded sequences were tightened in the editing process once the scenes had been played to the studio audience.

Episodes were mostly filmed in front of a live studio audience at Teddington Studios in London Borough of Richmond upon Thames on Wednesday evenings. Sue Vertue says that the live audience reinvigorated the company because no one had laughed at the material for a few days, as everyone knew it so well. A warm-up comedian updated the studio audiences about any important plot detail, introduced them to the performers, and provided entertainment while cameras and sets were being repositioned. Rob Rouse fulfilled this role for the fourth series.

Despite some critics&#x27; comments, all of the laughter in &quot;Coupling&quot; was from a genuine live studio audience. Although artificial canned laughter was not used, the laughter sometimes had to be tweaked during the editing process. For instance, the studio audience might laugh for longer than might be expected of the home audience. Also, the audience&#x27;s laughter decreased if a scene was shot multiple times; in these cases the laughter from an earlier take would be used.

Moffat felt uncomfortable and powerless during the studio recording. Sitting in the gallery, he wrote the word &#x27;help&#x27; repeatedly on the back of his scripts. In an interview for the DVD release, he says he was aware that their most successful show received the least amount of laughter from the studio audience. Conversely, studio audiences reacted emphatically to his previous studio sitcom, &quot;Chalk&quot;, yet it received a poor critical reception upon transmission. Martin Dennis would start editing from the following Monday afternoon. The episodes were then colour graded and dubbed with sound effects and music.

Mari Wilson performed the song &quot;Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps&quot;, written by Osvaldo Farrés and Joe Davis, to accompany the opening and closing credits. Simon Brint composed and arranged the incidental music. The title sequence, as Mark Lawson described, consists of &quot;brightly coloured and suggestive shapes swirl around the screen: circles, curves, and angles tumble like limbs locked together in sex. As the names of the actors discreetly sweep across in black lettering, the bright shapes form the title: &quot;Coupling&quot;.&quot; Lawson calls the design &quot;elegant simplicity, showing how a clever choice of theme tune can evoke an atmosphere and set a pace to which images can be cut.&quot; The colour scheme was changed for the fourth series, although the basic design remained.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
&quot;Coupling&quot; is almost entirely based around the antics of the six main characters. The show was inspired by Moffat&#x27;s relationship with producer Sue Vertue, to the extent that they gave their names to two of the characters. &quot;Coupling&quot; features no other recurring characters that last beyond a few episodes. In the series, &quot;the women are mainly confident and sexually quite voracious, whilst the blokes are completely useless, riddled with self-doubt and awkwardness.&quot;

Steve Taylor (Jack Davenport) is in the process of breaking off his relationship with Jane as the series begins. The remainder of the series shows the development of a relationship with Susan, from dating, proposal of marriage, and as the last series concludes, becoming father to her baby. No reference is made to Steve&#x27;s job during the series, but in a DVD commentary, Moffat mentions that Steve is, like him, a writer.
Moffat had used the surname &quot;Taylor&quot; for Robert Bathurst&#x27;s character in his earlier sitcom &quot;Joking Apart&quot;.

According to the BBC&#x27;s website, Steve &quot;tries to be the voice of reason while talking to his mates over a pint, but more often than not he stumbles into more complex and ridiculous situations than any of them.&quot; Writer Moffat says that Steve

can be just as erratic as Jeff can be, and certainly in the first part of the series, he remonstrates with Jeff for his madness. At the same time he tells Patrick off for being ruthless with women, and yet the evidence shows that Steve himself is a bit of a bastard. For example he asks Susan out on a date while he&#x27;s having sex with Jane. He is quite typical of having all the same lusts and appetites as Patrick while also having the nervousness of Jeff and the new character Oliver. He forms a compromise of a politically correct weasel, which helps him to believe that he&#x27;s a decent chap. Actually he&#x27;s really too frightened of Susan to misbehave!

Susan Walker (Sarah Alexander) – Best friend to Sally, girlfriend/fiancée to Steve and ex-girlfriend of Patrick, Susan is one of Jeff&#x27;s colleagues. Susan is usually very sensible and organised, a fact often resented by her friends Sally and Jane. Susan can be very insecure and often takes this out on Steve. When angry, she generally says &quot;apparently&quot;, a habit first noted in the first series episode &quot;Inferno&quot; and shown to be inherited from her mother in &quot;My Dinner in Hell&quot;. In the series one episode &quot;Size Matters&quot;, Susan is implied to view Angus Deayton in the same way that Steve views Mariella Frostrup, even keeping two pictures of him hidden in her bedroom. Steve and Susan&#x27;s various arguments and differences of opinion make up a majority of the comic exchanges between them. Susan is a successful career woman, speaks French fluently, and takes her work life very seriously. Whilst Susan&#x27;s job is never directly referred to, she works alongside Jeff, an accountant, and she reveals she has a degree in economics. In series four, she has a baby boy with Steve.

Jeff Murdock (Richard Coyle) – Best friend to Steve, he is a co-worker to Susan, whom he previously dated. Jeff&#x27;s constant sexual frustration, ridiculous stories, and fantasies about women and sex make up a major part of the comedy. Scholar Jeffrey Griffin observes, &quot;Jeff is known for his bizarre theories, one or two of which he outlines in every episode [... serving as] the defining element of an episode, with the plot unfolding in some way that tests one of Jeff’s theories.&quot;

Jeff is terrible at talking to women, often stumbling and unintentionally making up lie upon lie in an attempt to avoid looking stupid. These always backfire on him. From titbits he occasionally lets slip, his problems apparently can largely be traced back to his eccentric and domineering mother (who appears in series two&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot;, played by Anwen Williams). Jeff works as an accountant in an office with Susan, and through him, Steve and Susan initially meet. Coyle quit his role as Jeff before the fourth series. However, his character returns in a dream sequence in Steve&#x27;s imagination in the final episode, &quot;Nine and a Half Months&quot;; portrayed by Samantha Spiro, &quot;Jeffina&quot; has undergone sex-reassignment surgery whilst living on the island of Lesbos, in a failed attempt to see another woman naked again. Jeff is also featured in the written epilogue published by Moffat online for the show.

Sally Harper (Kate Isitt) – Best friend to Susan (and girlfriend to Patrick by series four), Sally is obsessed with her own appearance and constantly worries about the effects of ageing and life in general on her looks. Her worst fear seems to be of dying alone, but she seems totally inept at relationships due to her frequent paranoia, which tends to make her out as a very mean-spirited woman. Sally runs her own beauty parlour and is a successful businesswoman, but of the entire group, she is the most insecure and resentful. A Labour supporter, she finds reconciling this with her attraction to Patrick, a Conservative, to be difficult.

Patrick Maitland (Ben Miles) – Ex-boyfriend to Susan (and Sally&#x27;s boyfriend by series four), Patrick has a one-track mind: sex. This gives him a very narrow view of women, but he is great at courting them. Frequent references are made to his rather large penis; Susan nicknames him &quot;donkey&quot; and &quot;tripod&quot;, sparking much of Sally&#x27;s initial interest in him despite her objections to his political beliefs (Patrick is a Conservative, which conflicts with Sally&#x27;s left-wing attitudes). Patrick has a habit of saying things without thinking that give the impression that he is rather dense. Two explanations for this given in the series are his own claim that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have a subconscious&quot; and thus &quot;nothing is going on&quot; in his head and Sally&#x27;s remark that there is not enough blood in his body for &quot;both ends&quot; (making reference to his abnormally large penis). He is very good at getting women to bed, and cannot comprehend meeting a woman and not having sex with her. In the fourth series, he is revealed to generally leave in the middle of the night. In one episode, unknown to him, a woman from his past made a vibrator from a plaster cast of Patrick&#x27;s erect penis and marketed as the Junior Patrick; the box clearly has a 10-inch measurement on the side when seen later in the episode. Patrick&#x27;s love of the ladies often backfires, and the series frequently features story lines about his possessive lovers and ex-lovers. Patrick is a successful businessman and is very competitive with others in the same business, but he does have a vague sense of loyalty to his friends. He collects videos of nights with his girlfriends in his rather large &quot;cupboard of love.&quot; Patrick proposes to Sally in the last episode when she finds the engagement ring in the cupboard, but her answer is left unknown.

Jane Christie (Gina Bellman) – Ex-long-time partner of Steve, Jane is a histrionic who is very possessive, and despite breaking up with Steve in the first episode, she never truly seems to let go. Jane has a problem talking to men, often coming on much too strong and appearing desperate or rude to others in her pursuit of a man. Her character also seems not to be too bright, perhaps even disturbed, and is known to be incredibly self-obsessed, as shown in a second series episode when a &quot;subtext detector&quot; shows that the only thing she ever really means when talking is the word &quot;me&quot;. In the fourth series, everyone starts referring to her as being &quot;mad&quot;. Jane claims to be bisexual, although she is never seen dating a woman. Susan time and again expresses scepticism, so this claim may be a ploy to entice men. However, Susan (for her own reasons) French kisses Jane in the fourth series and Jane seems to be overwhelmed but enjoys it. However, her claim is also successfully challenged by Oliver Morris in the fourth series, where he points out that she is indeed not bisexual. Jane works in a local radio station as a traffic reporter and is popular mainly due to her flirtatious nature and sexually explicit reports. She was once briefly fired for telling all the drivers to close their eyes to centre themselves and changing the names of streets for her own amusement, among other things, but was rehired due to her popularity.

Oliver Morris (Richard Mylan) is introduced in the fourth series and eventually becomes involved with Jane. He runs a local science-fiction media store called &quot;Hellmouths&quot; and has been out of a relationship for several months. Oliver often has a very cynical outlook, but is prone to accidents, often making a fool of himself in the process. He is sometimes shown gearing himself up to meet women and have sex by thinking to himself, which the audience can hear. The geekiness of his job is also used for comic effect. Oliver also seems to have inherited Jeff&#x27;s inability to talk to women, however, unlike Jeff, he believes himself to be a ladies&#x27; man, or in his thoughts&#x27; words &quot;a woman-killer, I mean lady-killer...&quot;. Oliver has a tendency to use the word &quot;craziness&quot; frequently in conversations, usually as an attempt to alleviate tension when he starts blabbering. Richard Mylan has said in interview that people took a long time to accept his character due to Jeff&#x27;s popularity.

===Other characters===
Julia Davis (Lou Gish) appears in five episodes spanning over series two and three. She first appears in &quot;Naked&quot;, as the new head of department in the office where Jeff and Susan work. Julia and Jeff soon fall for each other due to their shared inability to hold a reasonable conversation with a member of the opposite sex. Despite overcoming the inevitable troubles with each other, their relationship ends when Julia&#x27;s ex, Joe, a soldier, returns believing Julia to still be his girlfriend. After finding Julia chained to the bed in her room, dressed in bondage gear, Joe attacks Jeff. In the final episode of series three, Jeff explains that Julia and Joe have left together to explore their feelings for each other, in Bolton.

Tamsin (Olivia Caffrey) is Oliver&#x27;s Irish ex-girlfriend, who left him for unknown reasons around six months prior to the beginning of the fourth series, and has since become pregnant by another man, with whom she has now split. She befriends Susan at an antenatal class and is also revealed to be one of Patrick&#x27;s many ex-girlfriends. Tamsin and Oliver seem to have a sour relationship, as is shown over the three episodes in which she features. She refers to him as a cross between brother and sister.

James (Lloyd Owen) appears in three episodes of series three. He hosts the religious programme at the radio station where Jane works, and Jane pretends to have an interest in religion to become his girlfriend. Jane is devastated to find he does not believe in sex before marriage, and even more so to find that he had a fervent sex life before finding God, which included a night with Susan. He leaves on a trip to Germany at the end of &#x27;&quot;The Freckle, the Key and the Couple Who Weren&#x27;t&quot; and returns in &quot;Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps&quot;, just as Jane is expressing her amazement that the many sexual encounters she has had while he was away have not made her pregnant (&quot;I have shagged and shagged and shagged and all the little bastards missed!&quot;).

Jill (Elizabeth Marmur) appears in an episode of series one and once again in series four. In the first series, Jill is Jane&#x27;s therapist whom Jane constantly manages to manipulate. She challenges Jane&#x27;s statement that she can be a vegetarian whilst still eating meat. She is dragged to a dinner party with Jane in an episode called &quot;Inferno&quot;, where everyone assumes she is a lesbian. She witnesses one of Steve&#x27;s monologues about loving naked bottoms when the subject of one of his videos, the legendary &quot;Lesbian Spank Inferno&quot;, comes up. Jill reappears in the fourth series as a pregnancy specialist, having retrained to avoid encountering Jane again; to her dismay, Jane attends one of her antenatal classes wearing a fake pregnancy belly, claiming to be simultaneously pregnant and not pregnant.

Wilma Lettings (Emilia Fox) 
Wilma Lettings appears in two consecutive episodes of series three (&quot;Faithless&quot; and &quot;Unconditional Sex&quot;) as a woman working in the same office as Jeff. In the first episode, Jeff agrees to go out for a drink with her, but is unsure whether or not it is a date, as they are both in relationships, but her boyfriend is away in Australia and he cannot tell her who his girlfriend is, as Julia does not want anyone in the office to know that they are dating. To further complicate matters, Wilma was present at an incident in which Jeff got his head trapped in a photocopier, and Jeff does not know if she found it funny or horrifying. The second episode starts with Jeff in the bar with Wilma, using an earpiece to allow the others to instruct him on the subtext of the conversation and how to respond. However, this is unnecessary, as Wilma quickly asked Jeff if he fancies her, to which he is forced to say yes, as Julia has taken the phone from Steve and asks him if he loves her at the same moment. Things quickly spiral out of control as Jeff tells Wilma that his girlfriend had recently died, on Jane&#x27;s suggestion, to get out of &#x27;the fork&#x27;. The episode ends with Wilma running out of Jeff&#x27;s flat after seeing Julia&#x27;s feet sticking out from under his duvet, when sleeping at his flat.

==Episodes==
Four series of &quot;Coupling&quot; were produced for the BBC. The first series of six episodes was broadcast on Friday evenings from 12 May to 16 June 2000. Nine episodes were commissioned for the second series, which was broadcast on Monday evenings in Autumn 2001. The third series, consisting of seven episodes, were broadcast a year later. The fourth series was first broadcast on BBC Three in May and June 2004, although the six episodes were repeated on BBC Two a few months later.

The BBC approached Moffat about writing a fifth series, but other commitments made gathering the cast impossible. Moffat began writing for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; when the show was revived in 2005, becoming the show&#x27;s executive producer and lead writer for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s fifth series in 2010. However, to finalise &quot;Coupling&quot;, Moffat posted some short storyline &quot;conclusions&quot; about the eventual fate of the characters on the website Outpost Gallifrey.

==Reception==

Critical reception was generally positive. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Mark Lawson applauded Moffat&#x27;s writing, specifically assessing the episode &quot;The Girl with Two Breasts&quot; as &quot;comic writing of astonishing originality and invention.&quot; The &quot;Daily Record&quot; called the show &quot;frank and funny.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Mark Thompson, then director of television at the BBC, mentioned Moffat&#x27;s earlier sitcoms &quot;Joking Apart&quot; and &quot;Chalk&quot; to suggest &quot;ambition in television is also about sharing the long road to originality and creative achievement.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; also comments, &quot;Moffat ... has long seemed to me one of the most original TV writers and it&#x27;s good that ratings-crazed television has persevered with him. His particular talent is for intricately plotted sexual farce.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; commented, &quot;Steven Moffat is turning out to be one of the boldest, most inventive, sitcom writers around.&quot; Scholar James Monaco comments that &quot;Coupling&quot; is &quot;witty and elegantly structured ... [taking] the &quot;Seinfeld&quot;/&quot;Friends&quot; model to new heights with intricately wrought plots built on the interactions of six young friends. Replete with rich dialogue and bright timing it renewed the British comedy franchise.&quot;

Various journalists compared the show to the American sitcoms &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; commented that the show was &quot;as a &#x27;highly original&#x27; and &#x27;unrestricted&#x27; cross of &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Mark Lawson similarly said, &quot;British commissioners have long dreamed that some local comedy lab would clone &quot;Friends&quot; or &quot;Seinfield&quot;. Moffat&#x27;s managed to cross them while creating a series which feels highly original.&quot; Further comparisons were made to &quot;Friends&quot; when NBC commissioned an American version of the show in 2003, although some newspapers still pointed out that &quot;Coupling&quot; &quot;owes much to &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, with laugh-out-loud riffs on &#x27;unflushable&#x27; exes, escalating &#x27;giggle loops&#x27; during solemn moments of silence and &#x27;porn buddies,&#x27; who in the event of your sudden demise will remove all of the naughty pictures and videos from your flat before your parents arrive.&quot; New York&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot;, which quotes Moffat &quot;boozier, smokier, more shag-infested series&quot; than &quot;Friends&quot;, also thought that &quot;some characters ... have ties closer to &quot;Seinfeld&quot; ... Jane, who, despite her beauty, is so abrasive she&#x27;s like a female Newman. And Richard Coyle&#x27;s Jeff is very much like Kramer: He&#x27;s uncomfortable in a topless club, he explains, because he equates the women to &#x27;porn that can see you&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Coupling&quot; was nominated for several awards, winning some of the accolades. It was awarded the Silver Rose for Best UK Sitcom at the Rose d&#x27;Or Light Entertainment Festival in 2001. It was nominated as &quot;Best TV Comedy&quot; in the 2001 British Comedy Awards, a category it won in 2003. In 2004, lighting cameraman Martin Kempton was nominated for a Royal Television Society Craft Award for Best Lighting, Photography and Camera (Lighting for Multicamera) for his work on the fourth series.

All four series were released in the UK, US, Israel, Canada, Hungary, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden, Portugal, the Benelux countries, Kenya, Turkey, and Latin America. In India, selected episodes were telecast on Comedy Central and BBC, and DVDs are available for sale online.

===Remakes===

In 2001, the American network NBC commissioned an adaptation of the show, which was reported as a possible replacement for &quot;Friends&quot;, which was coming to the end of its run. Moffat and Sue and Beryl Vertue served as executive producers alongside Phoef Sutton and Ben Silverman. Unlike most adaptations, the NBC version would reuse Moffat&#x27;s original scripts, although these were adapted by Sutton, and were shortened to comply with the shorter running time (NBC has multiple advertisement breaks compared to the original broadcaster, BBC Two, which has none). Other writers, such as Danny Zuker and Paul Corrigan, worked on episodes later in the series. The adaptation was attacked in the press before the first episode aired, because it was more sexually explicit than typical American television. The US version starred Colin Ferguson, Jay Harrington, Christopher Moynihan, Lindsay Price, Rena Sofer, and Sonya Walger; Gina Bellman, who plays Jane in the British series, made a cameo appearance in the first episode. The time slot was Thursday night at 9:30 pm following &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, and the show premiered on 25 September 2003. Following a poor audience and critical reception, the series was pulled from the schedules after airing just four episodes. By that point, 10 of 13 episodes commissioned by the network had been filmed; the remaining six remain unaired. Moffat blamed the show&#x27;s failure on NBC&#x27;s intervention during the creative and production processes.
A Greek adaptation was broadcast on ANT1 in 2007 and 2008.

<doc id="178894" wikidata="Q335075" url="?curid=178894" title="Abu Hamza al-Masri">
<text>Mustafa Kamel Mustafa (; born 15 April 1958), also known as Abu Hamza al-Masri (; , – literally, father of Hamza, the Egyptian), or simply Abu Hamza, is an Egyptian cleric who was the imam of Finsbury Park Mosque in London, where he preached Islamic fundamentalist views.

The UK tabloid press nicknamed him &quot;Captain Hook&quot; in allusion to the fictional pirate Captain Hook, due to his prosthetic hook devices.

In 2004, Hamza was arrested by British police after the United States requested he be extradited to face charges. He was later charged by British authorities with sixteen offences for inciting violence and racial hatred. In 2006, a British court found him guilty of inciting violence, and sentenced him to seven years&#x27; imprisonment. On 5 October 2012, after an eight-year legal battle, he was extradited from the UK to the United States to face terrorism charges and on 14 April 2014 his trial began in New York. On 19 May 2014, Hamza was found guilty of eleven terrorism charges by a jury in Manhattan. On 9 January 2015, he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

==Background==
Hamza was born Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1958, the son of a middle-class army officer. In 1979, he entered Britain on a student visa.

His initial reaction to life in Britain was to describe it as &quot;a paradise, where you could do anything you wanted.&quot; He studied civil engineering at Brighton Polytechnic. Prior to his adoption of Islamism in Malta, 1999, Hamza was known as a &quot;gentle giant&quot; and a &quot;womaniser&quot;. Hamza gained employment as a bouncer in the strip bars of Soho under his original name from 1980 until 1983, when club owner Jean Agius was arrested and charged for conspiring to be a pimp. Agius alleges that Hamza may have also co-owned a club during this time.

In the early 1990s, Hamza lived in Bosnia under another name, and fought alongside Bosniaks against Serbs and Croats during the Bosnian War.

Hamza, who has one eye and no hands, once claimed he lost them fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan. CNN reported they were &quot;injuries he says he sustained while tackling a landmine in Afghanistan.&quot;

Among several accounts that take issue with Hamza&#x27;s story, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera&#x27;s introduction to Omar Nasiri&#x27;s memoir &quot;Inside the Jihad: My Life with Al Qaeda&quot; says Hamza &quot;boosted his credibility&quot; with rumours he sustained the injuries fighting &quot;jihad&quot;; also that Nasiri knew they resulted from &quot;an accident during experiments in a training camp&quot;, and Hamza asked Nasiri &quot;to keep this secret in order to avoid undermining his reputation.&quot; This version of events is corroborated by Aimen Dean, a senior figure in al-Qaeda&#x27;s chemical weapons programme turned double agent for MI6. Both Dean and Hamza were trained by Abu Khabab, al-Qaeda&#x27;s top bomb maker. Dean states that Hamza sustained his injuries at a training camp near Lahore where, having prepared a batch of nitroglycerin, Hamza ignored his tutor&#x27;s instructions to wait for the mixture to cool before inserting the detonator. During his trial in the United States, Hamza stated that his injuries occurred whilst working with explosives with the Pakistani military in Lahore.

===Family===
On 16 May 1980, Hamza married British citizen Valerie Fleming, a Roman Catholic convert to Islam, and soon after they had a son, Mohammed Mustafa Kamel born in October 1981. In 1984, their relationship came under increasing strain and later in that year Hamza took three-year-old Mohammed with him to Egypt, effectively breaking contact with Valerie. Eventually they divorced and he married Najat Mustafa, with whom he has seven children: five sons followed by two daughters. Hamza&#x27;s stepdaughter, Donna Traverso, told &quot;The Times&quot; in 2006 that she was convinced Hamza had duped her mother, Valerie, into marrying him in order to gain the right to stay in the UK.

In 1999, Hamza&#x27;s son Mohammed, then 17 years old, was arrested in Yemen with Hamza&#x27;s stepson Mohssin Ghalain and eight other men. All were tried and convicted of planning a terrorist bombing campaign that the prosecution alleged Hamza had sent the men to carry out. Mohammed and Mohssin received prison sentences of three and seven years, respectively.

Hamza&#x27;s Moroccan daughter-in-law was jailed for attempting to smuggle a mobile phone sim card when visiting him in Belmarsh prison in 2012. She is now facing deportation but because she is the sole carer of her son, a British national, the European Court of Justice&#x27;s advocate general has ruled she cannot automatically be deported despite her criminality unless she is deemed to pose a &#x27;serious&#x27; threat to society.

==Religious life==
Hamza was the imam of Finsbury Park Mosque from 1997, and a leader of the Supporters of Sharia, a group that believed in a strict interpretation of Islamic law. On 14 September 1999, he sent an article to &quot;Al-Hayat&quot;, one of the largest pan-Arab newspapers, supporting the Russian apartment bombings, claiming that, while &quot;in a war, no one targets women and children in a war&quot;, these attacks were necessary as &quot;a Muslim revenge for the Russian criminal policies in Chechnya&quot;. In 2003, he addressed a rally in central London called by the Islamic al-Muhajiroun, where members spoke of their support for Islamist goals such as the creation of a new Islamic caliphate and replacing the Western-backed Middle Eastern regimes. 

On 4 February 2003 (after being suspended since April 2002), Hamza was dismissed from his position at the Finsbury Park Mosque by the Charity Commission, the government department that regulates charities in England and Wales. After his exclusion from the mosque, he preached outside the gates until May 2004, when he was arrested at the start of US extradition proceedings against him.

Hamza publicly expressed support for Islamist goals such as creating a caliphate, and for Osama bin Laden. He wrote a paper entitled &quot;El Ansar&quot; (&quot;The Victor&quot;) in which he expressed support for the actions of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in Algeria, but he later rejected them when they started killing civilians. In one sermon relating to the necessity of Jihad, he said: &quot;Allah likes those who believe in Him who kill those who do not believe in Him. Allah likes that. So if you Muslims don&#x27;t like that because you hate the blood, there is something wrong with you.&quot; 

On the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks, he co-organised a conference at Finsbury Park Mosque where he praised the hijackers. He allegedly associated with Abdullah el-Faisal, a Jamaican Muslim convert cleric who preached in the UK until he was imprisoned for urging his followers to murder Jews, Hindus, Christians and Americans, subsequently being deported to Jamaica in 2007.

==Arrests, charges and imprisonment==
Hamza was arrested in December 1980, during a raid on a Soho strip club, for overstaying his tourist visa, which allowed him to stay in the UK for one month. He pleaded guilty to overstay but was allowed to remain in the UK as he was married to a British citizen, Valerie Fleming.

On 26 August 2004, Hamza was arrested by British police under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which covers the instigation of acts of terrorism. Charges against him were dropped on 31 August 2004, but he was kept in jail whilst a US extradition case was developed and British authorities drew up further criminal charges of their own. Almost two months later, on 19 October 2004, Hamza was charged with fifteen offences under the provisions of various British statutes, including encouraging the killing of non-Muslims, and intent to stir up racial hatred. The trial commenced on 5 July 2005, but was adjourned, and not resumed until 9 January 2006. On 7 February 2006, he was found guilty on eleven charges and not guilty on four:
* Guilty of six charges of soliciting murder under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861; not guilty on three further such charges.
* Guilty of three charges related to &quot;using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to stir up racial hatred, contrary to section 18 (1) of the Public Order Act 1986&quot;, not guilty on one further such charge.
* Guilty of one charge of &quot;possession of threatening, abusive or insulting recordings of sound, with intent to stir up racial hatred, contrary to section 23 of the Public Order Act 1986&quot;.
* Guilty of one charge of &quot;possessing a document containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism&quot;, under the Terrorism Act 2000, s58. This charge under the Terrorism Act of 2000 related to his possession of an &quot;Encyclopedia of Afghan Jihad&quot;, an &quot;Al Qaeda Handbook&quot; and other propaganda materials produced by Abu Hamza.

In sentencing, Mr Justice Hughes said Hamza had &quot;helped to create an atmosphere in which to kill has become regarded by some as not only a legitimate course but a moral and religious duty in pursuit of perceived justice.&quot; Abu Hamza was sentenced to seven years&#x27; imprisonment.

In September 2012, Frank Gardner claimed that Queen Elizabeth II had been upset some years earlier that Abu Hamza al-Masri could not be arrested. The BBC apologised later that day for the claim.

===Costs===
On 18 January 2007, Lord Justice Hughes made an order for the recovery of the full costs of the court-appointed defence of the race-hate charges, estimated in excess of £1 million. This judgement was based on his view that &quot;the story I have been told today (by Abu Hamza) is simply not true&quot; that he [Abu Hamza] had no share in a £220,000 house in Greenford, west London. Hamza had claimed it belonged to his sister. The court also found that Abu Hamza was contributing £9,000 a year for private education for his children.

==Extradition to the United States==
On 27 May 2004, Hamza was detained on remand by British authorities and appeared before magistrates at the start of a process to try to extradite him to the United States. Yemen also requested his extradition. The United States wanted Hamza to stand trial for eleven counts relating to the taking of sixteen hostages in Yemen in 1998, advocating jihad in Afghanistan in 2001, supporting James Ujaama in an alleged attempt to establish a &quot;terrorist training camp&quot; in late 1999 and early 2000 near Bly, Oregon, and of providing aid to al-Qaeda. Ujaama is a US citizen who had met Abu Hamza in England in 1999 and was indicted in the US for providing aid to al-Qaeda, attempting to establish a terrorist training camp, and for running a website advocating global jihad. Abu Hamza was in Britain throughout the relevant period.

On 15 November 2007, British courts gave permission for Hamza&#x27;s extradition to the US. Abu Hamza appealed against this decision to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In the meantime, Hamza was kept in prison after the completion of his sentence.

On 8 July 2010, the ECHR temporarily blocked Hamza&#x27;s extradition to the United States to face terrorism charges until the court was satisfied that he would not be treated inhumanely. In past cases, the ECHR prevented the UK from deporting suspected foreign terrorists to places where they might be tortured. In Hamza&#x27;s case, this was extended to refusing extradition to a country where he might be jailed for life, and where the prison regime is judged too harsh. The court said there should be further legal argument on whether life without parole would be a breach of human rights. The court asked for fresh submissions on whether Hamza, and other prisoners awaiting extradition, would face inhumane treatment in the US if they were sent there to stand trial.

On 24 September 2012, the court agreed Hamza could be extradited to the US to face terrorism charges. After considering all evidence, statements by officials at ADX Florence, the court held that &quot;conditions at ADX would not amount to ill-treatment&quot; and also stated that &quot;not all inmates convicted of international terrorism were housed at ADX and, even if they were, sufficient procedural safeguards were in place, such as holding a hearing before deciding on such a transfer&quot; and that &quot;if the transfer process had been unsatisfactory, there was the possibility of bringing a claim to both the Federal Bureau of Prisons&#x27; administrative remedy programme and the US federal courts&quot;, referring to the Administrative Remedy Program. On 26 September 2012, a High Court judge halted the extradition of Hamza to the US on terror charges after the cleric launched a last-ditch appeal. On 5 October 2012, the High Court granted the UK&#x27;s government&#x27;s request to extradite Hamza to the US. The removal process took place that same evening, when Hamza was taken from Long Lartin jail to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk, where he was placed into the hands of the US Marshals.

Abu Hamza arrived in the US on the morning of 6 October 2012 to face eleven charges relating to hostage taking, conspiracy to establish a militant training camp and calling for holy war in Afghanistan. He appeared in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on 6 October and was then taken into custody. He appeared in court again on 9 October and pleaded not guilty to eleven charges.

On 14 April 2014, his trial opened with jury selection. His lawyer, Joshua Dratel, claimed Abu Hamza cooperated with MI5 and the police to help interact with the British Muslim community. On 19 May 2014, he was found guilty of the terror charges. British Home Secretary Theresa May said that she was &quot;pleased&quot; that Abu Hamza had &quot;finally faced justice&quot;. On 9 January 2015, Hamza was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, and the entire sentence would be served at ADX Florence in Colorado. In U.S. confinement, his hook devices were confiscated and replaced with a prosthetic spork.

In late August 2020, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that Abu Hamza had filed a lawsuit against the US Attorney General William Barr over what he described as &quot;inhumane and degrading&quot; conditions at ADX Florence. Hamza&#x27;s complaints included solitary confinement, the removal of his prosthetic hooks despite his lack of forearms, sustaining tooth decay from opening food packages, and encountering &quot;religious stress&quot; from eating kosher food.

==Books and booklets==
He wrote the following books and booklets:
*&quot;Be Aware of Takfir&quot; Np, nd.
*&quot;Ruling by Man Made Law, is it Major or Minor Kufr? Explaining the Words of ibn Abbas&quot; (Supporters of Shariah, 1996).
*&quot;Allah&#x27;s Governance on Earth&quot;. Np, 1999.

<doc id="178895" wikidata="Q257277" url="?curid=178895" title="Lana Clarkson">
<text>Lana Jean Clarkson (April 5, 1962 – February 3, 2003) was an American actress and fashion model. During the 1980s, she rose to prominence in several sword-and-sorcery films. In 2003, record producer Phil Spector shot and killed Clarkson inside his home; he was charged with second-degree murder and convicted in 2009.

== Early life ==
Clarkson was born in Long Beach, California, to Donna and James M. Clarkson and was raised in the hills of Sonoma County, California, from a young age. She had a brother, Jessee J. Clarkson, and a sister, Fawn. While living in Northern California, she attended Cloverdale High School and Pacific Union College Preparatory School. During the Christmas season of 1978 Clarkson&#x27;s family returned to Southern California and settled in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles. After Clarkson&#x27;s family moved back to Los Angeles County, she pursued a career in the entertainment industry as an actress and fashion model.

== Career ==
In the early 1980s, Clarkson landed bit parts in film and television. She made her screen debut as a minor character in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), director Amy Heckerling&#x27;s coming-of-age comedy. She played the wife of science teacher Mr. Vargas (Vincent Schiavelli). The film was her first speaking role. She appeared in &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983) behind Michelle Pfeiffer dancing on the floor of the Babylon Club. Her first big role was in the Nico Mastorakis science-fiction thriller Blind Date. 

As an actress, Clarkson became best known for her five feature films for producer Roger Corman, beginning with his fantasy film &quot;Deathstalker&quot; (1983), as a female warrior and love interest to the title character played by Richard Hill. Corman oriented his films towards young male viewers, using a mix of action and female nudity. Clarkson&#x27;s work in &quot;Deathstalker&quot; led to her being offered the title role in Corman&#x27;s next film, &quot;Barbarian Queen&quot; (1985), a role Corman referred to as &quot;the original Xena&quot; because of the parallel in featuring a strong female leading character in an action-oriented sword-swinging role.

In 1987, Clarkson appeared in the John Landis spoof &quot;Amazon Women on the Moon&quot;. Following that, Clarkson starred in Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;Barbarian Queen&quot; sequel, &quot;Barbarian Queen II: The Empress Strikes Back&quot;.

Clarkson starred as a supporting character in the period horror film &quot;The Haunting of Morella&quot; (1990) as the evil attendant to a young woman played by model/actress Nicole Eggert. In the film, Clarkson played a dominating lesbian character who tries to resurrect the spirit of a witch burned at the stake during the Salem witch trials. In her final film for Corman, &quot;Vice Girls&quot; (1996), Clarkson played one of three cops who posed as strippers to catch a serial killer.

Clarkson&#x27;s work in the B movie sci-fi genre inspired a cult following, making her a favorite at comic book conventions, where she made some promotional appearances signing autographs for her fans. She appeared in numerous other B movies as well as a range of television spots. She also appeared in commercials for Mercedes-Benz, Kmart, Nike, Mattel and Anheuser-Busch. Her television appearances include parts on &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot;, &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; and &quot;Wings&quot;, and a guest appearance as a villain on the television adaptation of Roger Corman&#x27;s film &quot;Black Scorpion&quot; in what would be her final role.

Clarkson traveled around the United States and Europe while working on fashion photo shoots. Other projects took her to Japan, Greece, Argentina, Italy, Switzerland, France, Jamaica, and Mexico.

In the 1980s, she volunteered weekly at the AIDS charity Project Angel Food, which delivers food for those in Los Angeles disabled by HIV or AIDS, at a time when the disease was greatly feared by the general public.

Clarkson&#x27;s career stalled as she approached her thirties. Unable to earn a living as an actress, Clarkson sought alternative sources of income, including operating her own website on which she sold autographed DVDs of her films and communicated directly with her fans on her own message board. Although she made a living playing sex symbols, Clarkson wished to be a comic actress or perform as a comedian. Her publicist friend Edward Lozzi told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; writer Dominic Dunne that Clarkson had been working on a stand-up comedy act that he had witnessed.

In 2001, while living in Venice, California, for the last several years, Clarkson developed, wrote, produced, and directed a showcase reel titled &quot;Lana Unleashed&quot;. She took a part-time side job as a hostess in early January 2003 at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, California, to make ends meet.

== Murder ==
On February 3, 2003, Clarkson was found dead in the mansion belonging to record producer Phil Spector. In the early hours of that morning, she met Spector while working at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. They left the House of Blues in Spector&#x27;s limousine and drove to his mansion. Spector and Clarkson went inside while his driver waited outside in the car. About an hour later, the driver heard a gunshot before Spector exited his house through the back door with a gun. He was quoted as saying, according to affidavits, &quot;I think I just shot her.&quot; Spector later said Clarkson&#x27;s death was an &quot;accidental suicide&quot; and that she &quot;kissed the gun&quot;.

Spector appeared in court charged with the murder of Clarkson in 2007. On September 26, 2007, the trial judge declared mistrial due to a hung jury ten to two for conviction. Spector was retried and in April 2009 he was found guilty of second-degree murder. Spector was sentenced on May 29, 2009, to 19 years to life in state prison. He died in 2021 while serving his sentence.

In February 2012, Donna Clarkson, Lana&#x27;s mother, settled a civil lawsuit with Spector and his insurance company over the wrongful death of Lana Clarkson. Terms of the settlement were not released to the public.

<doc id="178896" wikidata="Q1021857" url="?curid=178896" title="Ezra F. Vogel">
<text>Ezra Feivel Vogel (July 11, 1930 — December 20, 2020) was an American sociologist who wrote on modern Japan, China, and Korea. He was Henry Ford II Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard University.

His 1978 book &quot;Japan as Number One: Lessons for America&quot; was a best-seller in both English and Japanese, and his 2011 book &quot;Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China&quot; won the Lionel Gelber Prize.

==Biography==
Ezra Vogel was born to Joseph and Edith Vogel, a family of Jewish immigrants in 1930 in Delaware, Ohio. As a child, he helped his father in the family&#x27;s clothing store, known as The People&#x27;s Store. He graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1950, and maintained close ties with his alma mater for the rest of his life, donating royalties from his books and returning to campus frequently. While at Ohio Wesleyan, Vogel was a member of the Beta Sigma Tau fraternity (later merged with the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity).

He was drafted to serve two years in the U.S. Army without seeing combat during the Korean War. The service involved working for a psychiatric unit of a military hospital. After discharge, Vogel enrolled in the Department of Social Relations at Harvard and graduated with his PhD in 1958. His advisor was Talcott Parsons. After two years of field work in Japan, he worked as an assistant professor at Yale University from 1960 to 1961, but returned to Harvard for post-doctoral work on Chinese language and history. He was appointed as a lecturer in 1964, later becoming a tenured professor; he remained at Harvard until his retirement.

Vogel was involved with several research centers during his career. He was director of Harvard&#x27;s East Asian Research Center from 1972 to 1977 and chairman of the Council for East Asian Studies from 1977 to 1980. He also was director of the Program on US–Japan Relations at the Center for International Affairs from 1980 to 1987, and was named honorary director upon stepping down. He was director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies from 1973 to 1975 and from 1995 to 1999. He was founding director of the Asia Center (1997–1999). He retired on June 30, 2000.

Vogel was married to Charlotte Ikels, professor of anthropology at Case Western Reserve University. He had three children with his first wife, Suzanne Hall Vogel: David, Steven (who became a political scientist), and Eve.

Vogel died in Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 20, 2020, at the age of 90.

==Career==
Vogel published dozens of articles, reviews, conference papers and books on China, Japan, and American–East Asian relations, and organized scholarly and policy conferences. He headed the undergraduate East Asian Studies concentration (major) at Harvard.

After editing a book of readings on the sociology of the family, Vogel published his first book, &quot;Japan&#x27;s New Middle Class&quot; (1963; 2nd ed.1971), using ethnographic research he and his wife Suzanne carried out through interviews and observation in a Tokyo suburb between 1950 and 1960. Their goal was to understand the life of the &quot;salary man&quot; and his family, a new group that had emerged after the war. Vogel then turned from ethnography to China watching. He studied Chinese language, read newspapers and documents, and conducted interviews in Hong Kong. &quot;Canton Under Communism&quot; (1969) was a detailed description of regional government and politics in Guangdong. His 1979 book, &quot;Japan as Number One&quot;, described those areas where Japan had been successful and the United States less so. &quot;Most Japanese understate their successes because they are innately modest,&quot; he wrote, and &quot;more purposive Japanese, wanting to rally domestic forces or to reduce foreign pressures, have chosen to dramatize Japan&#x27;s potential disasters&quot;. On the American side, he continued, &quot;our confidence in the superiority of Western civilization and our desire to see ourselves as number one make it difficult to acknowledge that we have practical things to learn&quot;. The book&#x27;s translation into Japanese was a best-seller, arousing debate among American scholars of Japan.

His 1991 text &quot;The Four Little Dragons&quot; analyzed the spread of industrialization in east Asia. In Vogel&#x27;s view, Confucianism played an important role in the industrialization of east Asian economies, given that cultural values of hard work, collectivism, discipline, family, conscientiousness, responsibility, and saving are also favorable qualities for organizing rapid industrialization and an industrializing work force.

Vogel&#x27;s later areas of research included industrialization, changes in family structure, political change, and security issues in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and East Asia overall. In Beijing, he began to study Deng Xiaoping, following extensive interviews with Deng&#x27;s economic adviser Yu Guangyuan. Vogel co-translated Yu&#x27;s memoir on China&#x27;s economic reform, and used it as a roadmap to his thinking on Deng. He continued publishing after his retirement: his last two books were &quot;Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China&quot; (2011) and &quot;China and Japan: Facing History&quot; (2019). He contributed his royalties from the Chinese translation of this Deng political biography to his alma mater, Ohio Wesleyan, to promote international study and travel. The university estimated the contribution to be over $500,000.

Vogel served as National Intelligence Officer for East Asia with the National Intelligence Council from 1993 to 1995. In 1999, when American forces bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Vogel was reported by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as saying that it was not credible that the embassy was bombed by mistake when the C.I.A. used old maps. He later added &quot;I find it hard to believe that anyone would consciously do such a thing and certainly not as a matter of policy. On the other hand I don&#x27;t find it hard to believe that a massive mistake happened with a series of pitfalls and miscues adding up to disaster.&quot;

Starting in 2000, Vogel organized a series of conferences between Chinese, Japanese, and Western scholars to work together to examine World War II in East Asia; his intent was to promote reconciliation among the countries and support politicians who wanted to solve the lingering problems from that era. One of the resulting conference volumes was &quot;China at War: Regions of China, 1937–1945&quot; (2007), co-edited with Stephen R. Mackinnon and Diana Lary.

<text>A  (; ) is an act or an event that either provokes or is used to justify a war. A &quot;casus belli&quot; involves direct offenses or threats against the nation declaring the war, whereas a &quot;&quot; involves offenses or threats against its ally—usually one bound by a mutual defense pact. Either may be considered an A declaration of war usually contains a description of the &quot;casus belli&quot; that has led the party in question to declare war on another party.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;casus belli&quot; came into widespread use in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through the writings of Hugo Grotius (1653), Cornelius van Bynkershoek (1707), and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1732), among others, and due to the rise of the political doctrine of &quot;jus ad bellum&quot; or &quot;just war theory&quot;. The term is also used informally to refer to any &quot;just cause&quot; a nation may claim for entering into a conflict. It is used to describe the case for war given before the term came into wide use, and to describe the rationale for military action even without a formal declaration of war (as in: the lead up to the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution).

In formally articulating a &quot;casus belli&quot;, a government typically lays out its reasons for going to war, its intended means of prosecuting the war, and the steps that others might take to dissuade it from going to war. It attempts to demonstrate that it is going to war only as a last resort or plan (&quot;ultima ratio&quot;) and that it has &quot;just cause&quot; for doing so. Modern international law recognizes at least three lawful justifications for waging war: self-defense, defense of an ally required by the terms of a treaty, and approval by the United Nations.

&quot;Proschema&quot; (plural &quot;proschemata&quot;) is the equivalent Greek term, first popularized by Thucydides in his &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;. The proschemata are the stated reasons for waging war, which may or may not be the same as the real reasons, which Thucydides called prophasis (). Thucydides argued that the three primary real reasons for waging war are reasonable fear, honor, and interest, while the stated reasons involve appeals to nationalism or fearmongering (as opposed to descriptions of reasonable, empirical causes for fear).

== Reasons for use ==
Countries need a public justification for attacking another country, both to galvanize internal support for the war and to gain the support of potential allies.

In the post–World War II era, the UN Charter prohibits signatory countries from engaging in war except: 1) as a means of defending themselves—or an ally where treaty obligations require it—against aggression; 2) unless the UN as a body has given prior approval to the operation. The UN also reserves the right to ask member nations to intervene against non-signatory countries that embark on wars of aggression.

== Categorisation ==
Braumoeller (2019) stated: &quot;However idiosyncratic the &quot;casus belli&quot; may seem, however, there generally is one ... The issues that prompt most wars fit fairly well into one of a fairly manageable number of categories.&quot; He broadly summarised classical issues as territory, the creation or dissolution of countries, the defence of the integrity of countries, dynastic succession, and the defence of co-religionists or co-nationals. He pointed out that in the modern field of peace and conflict studies, scholars also frequently list causes such as &quot;struggle for power, arms races and conflict spirals, ethnicity and nationalism, domestic political regime type and leadership change, economic interdependence and trade, territory, climate change-induced scarcity, and so on&quot;.

In &quot;The Causes of War&quot; (1972), Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey mentioned general causes such as miscalculation, as well as specific causes such as &quot;Death Watch and Scapegoat Wars&quot;, and emphasised the importance of mundane factors such as weather.

Theodore K. Rabb and Robert I. Rotberg explored the roots of major conflicts as a mixture of factors on the international, domestic and individual level in &quot;The Origin and Prevention of Major Wars&quot; (1989).

Kalevi Holsti catalogued and categorised wars from 1648 to 1989 according to 24 categories of &quot;issues that generated wars&quot;.

A &quot;casus belli&quot; intentionally based on inaccurate facts is known as a pretext.

== Historical examples ==
This section outlines a number of the more famous and/or controversial cases of &quot;casus belli&quot; which have occurred in modern times.

=== Second Opium War ===
Europeans had access to Chinese ports as outlined in the Treaty of Nanking from the First Opium War. France used the execution of Auguste Chapdelaine as a &quot;casus belli&quot; for the Second Opium War. On February 29, 1856, Chapdelaine, a French missionary, was killed in the province of Guangxi, which was not open to foreigners. In response, British and French forces quickly took control of Guangzhou (Canton).

=== American Civil War ===

While long-term conflict between the Northern and Southern States (mainly due to moral questions caused by slavery, and particularly the expansion of slavery into territories with each new state giving extra leverage for the free or unfree side which the new state was to be part of, as well as socio-economic disparities) was the cause of the American Civil War, the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter (April 12–14, 1861) served as &quot;casus belli&quot; for the Union. Historian David Herbert Donald (1996) concluded that President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot; Confederate veteran William Watson opined in 1887 that up until that point, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward had not been able to find &#x27;a just cause to declare war against the seceded States&#x27;, but Sumter gave him &#x27;the &quot;casus belli&quot; he had sought&#x27;. Watson lamented how Jefferson Davis and other Confederate leaders were &#x27;vainglorious[ly]&#x27; celebrating the victory at Sumter, while forgetting that making the first move had given the Confederacy the immediate internationally negative reputation of being the aggressor, and had granted Seward &#x27;the undivided sympathy of the North&#x27;.

=== Spanish–American War ===

The &quot;Maine&quot; was a United States Navy ship that sank in Havana Harbor, Spanish Cuba on February 15, 1898. While the destruction of the &quot;Maine&quot; did not result in an immediate declaration of war with Spain, it did create an atmosphere that precluded a peaceful solution. The Spanish investigation found that the explosion had been caused by spontaneous combustion of the coal bunkers, but the US Sampson Board&#x27;s Court of Inquiry ruled that the explosion had been caused by an external explosion from a torpedo. The McKinley administration did not cite the explosion as a &quot;casus belli&quot;, but others were already inclined to go to war with Spain over perceived atrocities and loss of control in Cuba. Advocates of war used the rallying cry, &quot;Remember the &quot;Maine!&quot; To hell with Spain!&quot;

=== World War I ===

Austria-Hungary&#x27;s casus belli against Serbia in July 1914 was based upon Serbia&#x27;s refusal to investigate the involvement of Serbian government officials in the equipping, training and paying the assassins who murdered Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria at Sarajevo. The Serbian government refused the Austrian Démarche, and Austria-Hungary declared war.

For Britain, the direct cause of entering the war was the German invasion and occupation of Belgium, violating Belgian neutrality which Britain was bound by treaty to uphold.

In 1917, the German Empire sent the Zimmermann Telegram to Mexico, in which they tried to persuade Mexico to join the war and fight against the United States, for which they would be rewarded Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, all former Mexican territories. This telegram was intercepted by the British, then relayed to the U.S., which led to President Woodrow Wilson then using it to convince Congress to join World War I alongside the Allies. The Mexican president at the time, Venustiano Carranza, had a military commission assess the feasibility, which concluded that this would not be feasible for a number of reasons.

=== World War II ===
In Japanese Manchuria, Japan staged the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 as a casus belli to initiate the Second World War. 

In his autobiography &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Adolf Hitler had in the 1920s advocated a policy of &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (&quot;living space&quot;) for the German people, which in practical terms meant German territorial expansion into Eastern Europe.

In August 1939, to implement the first phase of this policy, Germany&#x27;s Nazi government under Hitler&#x27;s leadership staged the Gleiwitz incident, which was used as a &quot;&quot; for the invasion of Poland the following September. Nazi forces used concentration camp prisoners posing as Poles on 31 August 1939, to attack the German radio station Sender Gleiwitz in Gleiwitz, Upper Silesia, Germany (since 1945: Gliwice, Poland) on the eve of World War II. Poland&#x27;s allies, the UK and France, subsequently declared war on Germany in accordance with their alliance. The United States would declare war on Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

In 1941, acting once again in accordance with the policy of Lebensraum, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, using the &quot;casus belli&quot; of preemptive war to justify the act of aggression.

=== Vietnam War ===
Many historians have suggested that the Second Gulf of Tonkin Incident was a manufactured pretext for the Vietnam War. North Vietnamese Naval officials have publicly stated that during the second incident the was never fired on by North Vietnamese naval forces. In the documentary film &quot;The Fog of War&quot;, then-US Defense Secretary Robert McNamara concedes the attack during the second incident did not happen, though he says that he and President Johnson believed it did so at the time.

The first Gulf of Tonkin Incident (2 August) should not be confused with the second Gulf of Tonkin Incident (4 August). The North Vietnamese claimed that on August 2, US destroyer USS &quot;Maddox&quot; was hit by one torpedo and that one of the American aircraft had been shot down in North Vietnamese territorial waters. The PAVN Museum in Hanoi displays &quot;Part of a torpedo boat ... which successfully chased away the USS Maddox August 2nd, 1964&quot;.

The &quot;casus belli&quot; for the Vietnam War was the second incident. On August 4, USS &quot;Maddox&quot; was launched to the North Vietnamese coast to &quot;show the flag&quot; after the first incident. The US authorities claimed that two Vietnamese boats tried to attack USS &quot;Maddox&quot; and were sunk. The government of North Vietnam denied the second incident completely.

=== 1967 Arab-Israeli War ===
A &quot;casus belli&quot; played a prominent role during the Six-Day War of 1967. The Israeli government had a short list of &quot;&quot;, acts that it would consider provocations justifying armed retaliation. The most important was a blockade of the Straits of Tiran leading into Eilat, Israel&#x27;s only port to the Red Sea, through which Israel received much of its oil. After several border incidents between Israel and Egypt&#x27;s allies Syria and Jordan, Egypt expelled UNEF peacekeepers from the Sinai Peninsula, established a military presence at Sharm el-Sheikh, and announced a blockade of the straits, prompting Israel to cite its &quot;casus belli&quot; in opening hostilities against Egypt.

=== China-Vietnam War ===
During the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese War, China&#x27;s leader Deng Xiaoping told the United States that its plan to fight the Vietnamese was revenge for Vietnam&#x27;s toppling of the Khmer Rouge regime of Cambodia, an ally of China. However Chinese nationalists have argued that the real &quot;casus belli&quot; was Vietnam&#x27;s poor treatment of its ethnic Chinese population, as well as suspicion of Vietnam trying to consolidate Cambodia with Soviet backing.

=== 2003 invasion of Iraq ===
When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, it cited Iraq&#x27;s non-compliance with the terms of cease-fire agreement for the 1990–1991 Gulf War, as well as planning in the 1993 attempted assassination of former President George H. W. Bush and firing on coalition aircraft enforcing the no-fly zones as its stated &quot;&quot;.

Cited by the George W. Bush administration was Saddam Hussein&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program. The administration claimed that Iraq had not conformed with its obligation to disarm under past UN Resolutions, and that Saddam Hussein was actively attempting to acquire a nuclear weapons capability as well as enhance an existing arsenal of chemical and biological weapons. Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed a plenary session of the United Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003, citing these reasons as justification for military action. Since-declassified National Intelligence Estimates (NIE&#x27;s) indicate that any certainty may have been overstated in justification of armed intervention; the extent, origin and intent of these overstatements cannot be conclusively determined from the NIE.

===Annexation of Crimea===
After the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin argued that Crimea and other regions &quot;were not part of Ukraine&quot; after it was taken in the 18th century. The ethnic Russian population in Crimea and eastern Ukraine has been seen as a &quot;casus belli&quot; for Russia&#x27;s annexation. The Foreign Ministry claimed that Ukraine tried to seize Crimean government buildings, citing this as a &quot;casus belli&quot;.

=== 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine ===
Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia recognized the separatist republics in Donetsk and Luhansk, and the alliance between them was ratified in their parliaments, thus creating a usable &quot;casus belli&quot;. Russia also claimed a genocide was being committed against Russian speakers in Ukraine by neo-Nazi groups and that the Ukrainian government were neo-Nazis. A false-flag operation was also considered by Russia, according to US, UK, and Ukrainian intelligence.

=== 2023 Israel–Hamas war ===

On October 7, 2023, Palestinian militant groups, led by Hamas, launched a major attack into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. This operation was called &#x27;Operation Al-Aqsa Flood&#x27; by Hamas. In response, the Israel Defense Forces launched a counteroffensive, officially named &#x27;Operation Iron Swords&#x27;. Following reports that Egypt had given Israel a three day heads-up that &quot;something big&quot; and &quot;an explosion of the situation is coming&quot;, questions emerged about IDF&#x27;s readiness, and whether Israel had ignored the information.

<doc id="178907" wikidata="Q678692" url="?curid=178907" title="Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore">
<text>Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (8 August 1605 – 30 November 1675) was an English politician and lawyer who was the first proprietor of Maryland. Born in Kent, England in 1605, he inherited the proprietorship of overseas colonies in Avalon (Newfoundland) (off the eastern coast of the North America continent), along with Maryland after the 1632 death of his father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1580–1632), for whom it had been originally intended in a vast land grant from King Charles I (1600–1649, reigned 1625–1649). Young Calvert proceeded to establish and manage the Province of Maryland as a proprietary colony for English Catholics from his English country house of Kiplin Hall in North Yorkshire.

As a Catholic, he continued his father&#x27;s legacy by promoting religious tolerance in the colony. He also was involved in the establishment of the Newfoundland Colony and the Province of Avalon. Maryland quickly became a haven for English Catholics in the Americas, particularly due to rising religious persecution in England. Governing Maryland&#x27;s affairs since its founding for 44 years, Calvert died in England in 1675. After his death, the Protestant Revolution along the Chesapeake Bay (&quot;Glorious Revolution&quot;) of 1689, matched events occurring overseas across the Atlantic Ocean in Europe, overturning King James II and the Stuart royal dynasty of England and Scotland, and ended Roman Catholic control (and temporarily that of the Calvert family and the Lords Baltimore) of the Province of Maryland colony (including the other original Thirteen Colonies along the East Coast of British America), and established Protestant supremacy.

==Early life and education==
Calvert was born on 8 August 1605 in Kent, England, to George Calvert, a young English lawyer and assistant to Lord Cecil (1563–1612), Secretary of State to King James I, and was christened &quot;Cecilius&quot; in honour of his father&#x27;s employer. His mother, his father&#x27;s wife, was Anne Mynne (or Mayne), and he was the first of several sons. At the time, his father was under pressure to conform, and all ten children were baptised into the Church of England.

Calvert entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1621. His mother died the following year. In 1625, his father, George Calvert, was created the first Baron Baltimore, of Baltimore, County Longford, in the peerage of Ireland, which did not give him a seat in the English House of Lords. He formally converted to Roman Catholicism the same year, and it is likely that his children followed him; at least his sons did.

In 1628, Cecil Calvert accompanied his father, along with most of his siblings and his stepmother, to the newly settled Colony of Newfoundland. The colony failed due to disease, extreme cold and attacks by the French, and the family returned to England.

Cecil Calvert succeeded as the second Baron Baltimore upon his father&#x27;s death in April 1632. On 8 August 1633, the new Lord Baltimore was called to the bar as a barrister from Gray&#x27;s Inn.

==Settlement of the Maryland colony==
===Maryland Charter===
Lord Baltimore, as Cecil now was, received a Charter from King Charles I for the new colony of Maryland, to be named for the Queen Consort, Henrietta Maria (wife of King Charles I). This was shortly after the death, in April 1632, of his father, George who had long sought the charter to found a colony in the mid-Atlantic area to serve as a refuge for English Roman Catholics. The original grant would have included the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay as far south as the Potomac River and the entirety of the eastern shore (later known as the Delmarva peninsula).

When the Crown realised that settlers from Virginia had already crossed the bay to begin settling the southern tip of their eastern shore, the grant was revised to include the eastern shore only as far south as a line drawn east from the mouth of the Potomac River (including the future State of Delaware). Once that alteration was made, the final charter was confirmed on 20 June 1632. This charter would be heavily contested by the 2nd Lord Baltimore&#x27;s heirs and the Penn family in the Penn–Calvert Boundary Dispute.

Baltimore&#x27;s fee for the Charter, which was legally a rental of the land from the King, was one-fifth of all gold and silver found and the delivery of two Native American arrows to the royal castle at Windsor every Easter. The Charter established Maryland as a palatinate, giving Baltimore and his descendants rights nearly equal to those of an independent state, including the rights to wage war, collect taxes and establish a colonial nobility. In questions of interpretation of rights, the Charter would be interpreted in favour of the proprietor.

Supporters in England of the Virginia colony opposed the Charter, as they had little interest in having a competing colony to the north. Rather than going to the colony himself, Baltimore stayed behind in England to deal with the political threat and sent his next younger brother Leonard in his stead. He never travelled to Maryland.

While the expedition was being prepared, Baltimore was busy in England defending the 1632 Charter from former members of the Virginia Company. They were trying to regain their original Charter, including the entirety of the new Maryland colony, which had previously been included within the domains described as a part of Virginia. They had informally tried to thwart the founding of another colony for years, but their first formal complaint was lodged with the &quot;Lords of Foreign Plantations&quot; (Lords of Trade and Plantations) in July 1633. The complaint claimed that Maryland had not truly been unsettled, as stated in its charter, because William Claiborne had previously run a trading station on Kent Island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay off the eastern shore. It also claimed that the Charter was so broad as to constitute a violation of the liberties of the colony&#x27;s subjects. At this point, there were few Marylanders yet in residence.

===&quot;Ark&quot; and &quot;Dove&quot;===
The first expedition consisted of two ships that had formerly belonged to Baltimore&#x27;s father George, &quot;Ark&quot; and &quot;Dove&quot;. Both ships departed from Gravesend, Kent with 128 settlers on board, but were intercepted and forced to return to port by the Royal Navy so that the settlers would take an oath of allegiance to the King as required by law. They then sailed to the Isle of Wight in October 1632 to pick up more settlers. There, two Jesuit priests (including Father Andrew White) and nearly 200 more settlers boarded before the ships set out across the Atlantic Ocean.

Baltimore sent detailed instructions for the governance of the colony. He directed his brother to seek information about those who had tried to thwart the colony and to contact William Claiborne to determine his intentions for the trading station on Kent Island. He also emphasised the importance of religious toleration among the colonists, who numbered nearly equally Catholic and Protestant.

With these last instructions, the expedition crossed the Atlantic and sailed through Cape Charles (headland) and Cape Henry into the large harbour and lower bay called Hampton Roads at the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay and the mouth of the James River. After meeting with the Virginians at their colony and capital of Jamestown, they continued up the Bay to the Potomac River, then further upstream and landed on 25 March 1634 at Blakistone Island (later called St. Clement&#x27;s Island). There they erected a cross and celebrated their first Mass with Father White. Several days later, they returned downstream and founded the first settlement at St. Mary&#x27;s City (in the future St. Mary&#x27;s County), on 27 March 1634, on land purchased from the native Yaocomico tribe, a branch of the Piscataway Indians.

From England, Baltimore tried to manage the political relations with the Crown and other parts of government. Claiborne, the trader on Kent Island, resisted the new settlement and conducted some naval skirmishes against it.

Calvert attempted to stay closely involved in the governance of the colony, though he never visited it. During his long tenure, he governed through deputies: the first was his younger brother Leonard Calvert (1606–1647), and the last was his only son Charles.

==Crisis before and during the English Civil War==

The enterprise took place in the context of serious unrest in England. In 1629, King Charles I had dissolved Parliament and governed for the next eleven years without consultation from any representative body. William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, and his Star Chamber campaigned against both Puritans and Catholics. As a result, the Puritans and Separatists began to emigrate to New England in Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony. Catholics began to see Maryland as a possible English-speaking place of refuge.

Lord Baltimore, a Catholic, struggled to maintain possession of Maryland during the English Civil War by trying to convince Parliament of his loyalty; he appointed a Protestant, William Stone, as his governor. It is accepted he did this exclusively to maintain possession of the colony during the civil war, as his loyalties were with King Charles.

==Religious toleration==

On 21 April 1649, Maryland passed the Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the &quot;Act Concerning Religion&quot;, mandating religious tolerance for Trinitarian Christians only (those who profess faith in the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; – Father, Son and Holy Spirit, excluding Nontrinitarian faiths). Passed on 21 September 1649 by the General Assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the first law establishing religious tolerance in the British North American colonies. The Calvert family sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and Nonconformist Protestants who did not conform to the established Church of England. However, this act was repealed shortly after its passage.

==Baltimore&#x27;s colony in Newfoundland==

Lord Baltimore&#x27;s family also had title to Ferryland and the Province of Avalon in Newfoundland. George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore administered the colony between 1629 and 1632, when he left for the Colony of Virginia and later visited the northern reaches along the Chesapeake Bay (which included the future Maryland). In 1637, however, Sir David Kirke acquired a charter giving Cecil the title to the entire island of Newfoundland, superseding the charter granted to his father George. The 2nd Lord Baltimore fought against the new Charter. Although, in 1661, he gained official recognition of the old Charter of Avalon, he never attempted to retake the Avalon colony. Sir George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, cited the huge expense of fighting the French privateer de la Rade as one of the reasons for abandoning the Colony of Avalon in 1629.

==Marriage and family==

He married Anne Arundell, &quot;Reichsgräfin von Wardour&quot;, daughter of Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour, in 1627 or 1628. They had nine children. Of the nine, only three, including Charles, 3rd Baron Baltimore, survived to adulthood. Later, her name became the inspiration for the naming of one of the earliest counties to be &quot;erected&quot; (founded), namely Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Anne&#x27;s father built Hook Manor, a country house near Semley, Wiltshire for her in 1637 and gave the house (which still stands) to the couple in 1639.

Cecil, 2nd Lord Baltimore, died in Middlesex, England, on 30 November 1675. He was succeeded by his son and heir, Charles.

==Death and burial==
He died in England on 30 November 1675, aged 70 years. Parish records state that he is buried at St. Giles-in-the-Fields Church, London, UK, though the exact location of his grave is unknown.

A plaque commemorating Cecil Calvert was placed in St. Giles&#x27;s in 1996 by the Governor of Maryland. However, genealogists for Kiplin Hall state, &quot;A number of the early Calverts were buried at St Giles in the Fields, Charing Cross Road, London. We cannot yet be certain whether Cecil is one of them.&quot; This is possibly due to poor record keeping of Catholic burials or numerous outbreaks of disease that overwhelmed burial staff and led to confusion in parish registers.

==Legacy and honours==

A 1908 statue of Cecil, Lord Baltimore, by sculptor Albert Weinert, for which Francis X. Bushman served as sculptor&#x27;s model, stands on the steps at the west entrance of the Circuit Courthouse of Baltimore City (built 1896–1900 – renamed the Clarence M. Mitchell Jr. Courthouse in the 1980s) facing Saint Paul Street and a small Court Plaza with a fountain. It is the site of annual &quot;Maryland Day&quot; (25 March) ceremonies which continue inside the elaborate lobby and ceremonial courtrooms.

Harford County is named for Henry Harford, the illegitimate son of Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore. Although precluded by his birth status from inheriting the peerage, he inherited the Lord Proprietorship, only to lose it later during the American Revolution.

The Flag of Maryland uses the arms of the Cecil&#x27;s along with the Calvert (father&#x27;s family) black and gold paly (6 vertical bars), with a bend dexter counterchanged, and the Crossland (mother&#x27;s family) red and white bottony (tre-foiled) counterchanged cross. The flag first flew on 11 October 1880, in Baltimore by the newly reorganised Maryland National Guard (state militia) at a parade marking the 150th anniversary of the founding of Baltimore Town (1729–1730). It also flew on 25 October 1888, at Gettysburg Battlefield for ceremonies dedicating monuments to the Maryland regiments of the Army of the Potomac and of the Confederate States Army. During the Civil War, the black and gold chevrons were used as a symbol on uniforms and flags by the Northern (Union) Maryland soldiers and units and the bottony cross from the Crosslands by the Southern (Confederate) regiments from Maryland. The later reunification of the two squares of the colonial seal and proprietary family&#x27;s coat-of-arms in the increased use of a &quot;Maryland Flag&quot; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries symbolised the post-war reconciliation of the two sides of the bitterly divided border state. Officially, it was adopted as the State flag in 1904.

The Great Seal of Maryland, which was stolen in 1645, was replaced by a similar seal by Cecil. The seal features the Calvert arms and motto, which is still used in the Government of Maryland.

===Newfoundland===
*On the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland is the settlement of Calvert
*Baltimore School is in nearby Ferryland.

==Coat of arms==
The black and gold quarters were the arms of the Calverts themselves, while the red and silver were for the Crosslands, the family of the 1st Baron&#x27;s mother, Alice.

Shield:
* Quarterly, 1st and 4th Paly of six Or and Sable a bend counterchanged (Calvert), 
* 2nd and 3rd Quarterly Argent and Gules over all a cross bottony counterchanged (Crosslands).

Crest: Out of a ducal coronet 2 pennants flying, the dexter Or, the sinister Sable

Supporters: Two leopards guardant Proper

Motto: (Italian), &quot;Fatti maschii, parole femine&quot;, meaning, &quot;Manly deeds, womanly words.&quot;

The coat was the inspiration for the naming of the Baltimore oriole bird, whose orange and black feathers resembled Lord Baltimore&#x27;s coat of arms. The bird in turn inspired the name of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.

<text>James Fuller Fixx (April 23, 1932 – July 20, 1984) was an American who wrote the 1977 best-selling book &quot;The Complete Book of Running&quot;. He is credited with helping start America&#x27;s fitness revolution by popularizing the sport of running and demonstrating the health benefits of regular jogging. He died of a heart attack while jogging at 52 years of age; his genetic predisposition for heart problems and other previous lifestyle factors may have caused his heart attack.

==Background==
James Fixx was born on April 23, 1932, in New York City. He graduated from Trinity School in New York and Oberlin College in Ohio. His father, Calvin Fixx, was an editor at &quot;Time&quot; who worked with Robert Cantwell and Whittaker Chambers.

==Career==
Fixx was a member of the high-IQ club, Mensa, and published three collections of puzzles: &quot;Games for the Super-Intelligent&quot;, &quot;More Games for the Super-Intelligent&quot;, and &quot;Solve It!&quot; The back flap of his first book says: &quot;... He spent his time running on the roads and trails near his home, training for the Boston Marathon.&quot;

Fixx started running in 1967 at age 35. At that time, he weighed 214 pounds (97 kg) and smoked two packs of cigarettes per day. Ten years later, when his book, &quot;The Complete Book of Running&quot; (which spent 11 weeks at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list) was published, he was 60 pounds (27 kg) lighter and smoke-free. In his books and on television talk shows, he extolled the benefits of physical exercise and how it considerably increased the average life expectancy.

The cover of his book &quot;The Complete Book of Running&quot; featured Fixx&#x27;s muscular legs against a red cover. The book sold over a million copies. In 1980, Fixx wrote a follow-up book titled &quot;Jim Fixx&#x27;s Second Book of Running: The Companion Volume to The Complete Book of Running&quot;. In 1982, Fixx published &quot;Jackpot!&quot;, the story of what happened after the publication of &quot;The Complete Book of Running&quot; when he experienced the &quot;Great American Fame Machine&quot;, becoming richer and more celebrated than he could have imagined.

==Death==
Fixx died on July 20, 1984, at age 52 of a heart attack, during his daily run on Vermont Route 15 in Hardwick. The autopsy, conducted by Vermont&#x27;s chief medical examiner, Eleanor McQuillen, revealed that atherosclerosis had blocked one coronary artery 95%, a second 85%, and a third 70%.

In 1986, exercise physiologist Kenneth Cooper published an inventory of the risk factors that might have contributed to Fixx&#x27;s death. Granted access to his medical records and autopsy, and after interviewing his friends and family, Cooper concluded that Fixx was genetically predisposed—his father died of a heart attack at 43 after a previous one at 35, and Fixx himself had a congenitally enlarged heart—and had an unhealthy life: Fixx was a heavy smoker before beginning running at age 36, had a stressful occupation, had undergone a second divorce, and gained weight up to 214 lb (97 kg). Medical opinion continues to uphold the link between moderate exercise and longevity.

==Legacy==
&quot;Maximum Sports Performance&quot;, a book by Fixx published posthumously, discusses the physical and psychological benefits of running and other sports, including increased self-esteem, acquiring a &quot;high&quot; from running, and being able to cope better with pressure and tension.

A carved granite monument—a book with an inscription to Jim Fixx from the people of Northeast Scotland—now stands in Hardwick Memorial Park in Hardwick, Vermont.

Comedian Bill Hicks frequently made Fixx the subject of a stand-up routine, humorously suggesting that Fixx&#x27;s death while jogging should be an argument against exercise (Hicks was a heavy smoker for many years like Fixx, and died from pancreatic cancer aged only 32). 
Portions of that routine were alleged to have been plagiarized by Denis Leary. Australian band The Fauves referenced Hicks&#x27; material in the song &quot;I&#x27;m Jim Fixx and I&#x27;m Dead Now&quot;, on their 2006 album &quot;Nervous Flashlights&quot;.

<doc id="178922" wikidata="Q8184137" url="?curid=178922" title="Abortion in the United Kingdom">
<text>Abortion in the United Kingdom is &quot;de facto&quot; available under the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 in Great Britain and the Abortion (Northern Ireland) (No.2) Regulations 2020 in Northern Ireland. The procurement of an abortion remains a criminal offence in Great Britain under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, although the Abortion Act provides a legal defence for both the pregnant woman and her doctor in certain cases. Although a number of abortions did take place before the 1967 Act, there have been around 10 million abortions in the United Kingdom. Around 200,000 abortions are carried out in England and Wales each year and just under 14,000 in Scotland; the most common reason cited under the ICD-10 classification system for around 98% of all abortions is &quot;risk to woman&#x27;s mental health.&quot;

Across the United Kingdom, abortion is permitted on the grounds of:
* risk to the life of the pregnant woman;
* preventing grave permanent injury to her physical or mental health;
* risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family (up to a term limit of 24 weeks of gestation); or
* substantial risk that, if the child were born, they would &quot;suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped&quot;.

The third ground is typically interpreted liberally with regards to mental health to create a &quot;de facto&quot; elective abortion service; 98% of the approximately quarter-million abortions performed in Great Britain are done so for that reason.

In Northern Ireland, abortion is also permitted within the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy for any reason.

Under the UK&#x27;s devolution settlements, abortion policy is devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly but not to the Welsh Parliament (Senedd). Abortion was previously highly restricted in Northern Ireland although it was permitted in limited cases. In 2019, during a time when the Assembly was not operating, the UK Parliament repealed most restrictions on abortion in Northern Ireland; the current Regulations were subsequently introduced by Parliament in 2020.

Abortions which are carried out for grounds outside those permitted in law (e.g. in most cases after the 24-week term limit, or where appropriate consent has not been given) continue to be unlawful in each jurisdiction of the UK – under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 in England and Wales, Scottish common law, and the Northern Ireland Regulations. The Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 and the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 also outlaw child destruction in cases outside the grounds permitted in abortion law. Proposals to fully decriminalise abortion in Great Britain have occurred in 2024.

==History==
Debates and practices relating to abortion, pregnancy and the beginning of human life are recorded in Roman medical literature which would have been become available in Britain from the 1st century AD onwards. The medical writer Soranus of Ephesus, for example, wrote in the early 2nd century:

Similar issues would also have been discussed in Celtic culture, although written Celtic texts were only available from around the 4th century. An early Christian understanding of preventing abortion and infanticide, as outlined in the 1st century &quot;Didache&quot; and similar writings, would have been known in the early British Church which experienced more freedom and influence following Constantine&#x27;s Edict of Milan in 313 AD, and also in the early Irish Church after it was founded by Patrick around 432 AD.

Alongside this cultural change in Roman society, a more significant sense of value was associated with the life (and death) of infant and neo-natal children. Several studies of the burials of children who died before or close to the time of birth in Roman Britain have been made, and the presence of neo-natal burials given the same burial rites as adults is &quot;a pointer to identification of the cemetery as Christian&quot; as such burials were rare before the 4th century.

Care for abandoned or unwanted children, such as kinship care within families and friendship circles, and the adoption and fostering of &quot;alumni&quot;, were also well-established in Roman society. In the early Middle Ages, in Britain and other regions of Northern Europe, parents who did not want to raise their children often gave them to monasteries along with a small fee – an practice known as &quot;oblation&quot;.

Abortion was mainly dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts until their abolition during the Reformation. These cases were generally assigned to the ecclesiastical courts due to problems of evidence; the courts had wider evidential rules and more discretion regarding sentencing. A number of cases such as the &quot;Twinslayers Case&quot;, in England in 1327, were heard in the secular courts as part of the common law. Later, under Scottish common law, abortion was defined as a criminal offence unless performed for &quot;reputable medical reasons&quot;, a definition which could be interpreted as sufficiently broad as to essentially preclude prosecution.

===Early statute and modern case law===
The legality of abortion, and the value of the lives of pregnant women and unborn children, in common law was discussed by several English jurists from the Middle Ages onwards, including Henry Bracton, William Stanford, Edward Coke and William Blackstone. For example, Blackstone wrote in his 1765 &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;:

Shortly after his appointment as Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough, codified abortion as an offence in statute law, in England and Wales and Ireland, through the Malicious Shooting or Stabbing Act 1803, which became known as Lord Ellenborough&#x27;s Act. This legislation and the subsequent acts in the 19th century did not apply to Scotland due to its separate legal system based on common law.

The 1803 Act introduced capital punishment for wilfully, maliciously, and unlawfully administering &quot;any deadly poison, or other noxious and destructive substance or thing, with intent[...] to cause and procure the miscarriage of any woman, then being quick with child&quot; (section 1) and penalties, at the discretion of the court, up to and including penal transportation for using means to &quot;cause the miscarriage of any woman not being, or not being proved to be, quick with child&quot; (section 2).

The offences created by the 1803 Act were consolidated in the first Offences Against the Person Act, introduced by Robert Peel and enacted for England in 1828, which outlined the same offences and punishments (section 13). The same consolidation took place in Irish law through the Offences Against the Person (Ireland) 1829 (section 16). Both Acts were replaced by the Offences Against the Person Act 1837 which created a single abortion offence without a distinction around a pregnant woman being quick with child or not, and also repealed the death penalty for causing an abortion.

The law was again consolidated through the Offences against the Person Act 1861, which continues to be the main legislation for prosecuting personal injury in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Act created two offences – administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion (section 58), which replaced the previous legislation from 1839 and allowed for a sentence of life imprisonment; and procuring drugs, or any other means, to cause abortion (section 59) with a potential sentence of three years&#x27; imprisonment. The content of the 1861 Act was applied in colonial legislation throughout the British Empire in subsequent years e.g. the Offences Against the Person Act 1866 in New Zealand.

Alongside legislation against abortion, philanthropy encouraged more formal and organised arrangements to care for children born from unwanted pregnancies through the initiatives of social reformers; examples included the orphanage movement (which included the Foundling Hospital, London, in 1739); the pioneering of foster care in Cheshire in 1853 by John Armistead; and the Adoption of Children Act 1926, for England and Wales.

In the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, abortifacents were discreetly advertised for women with unwanted pregnancies who were seeking abortions; there was also a considerable body of folklore about inducing miscarriages. So-called &#x27;backstreet&#x27; abortionists using methods such as these were relatively common although their efforts could be fatal. Estimates of the number of illegal abortions varied widely; by one estimate, 100,000 women made efforts to procure an abortion in 1914, usually by drugs.

The criminality of abortion in England and Wales was reaffirmed in 1929, when the Infant Life (Preservation) Act was passed; the Act criminalised the deliberate destruction of a child &quot;capable of being born alive&quot;. This was to close a lacuna in the law, identified by the former High Court judge Charles Darling, 1st Baron Darling, which allowed for infants to be killed during birth, thus meaning that the perpetrator could neither be prosecuted for abortion or murder. The Act included the presumption that all children &quot;in utero&quot; over 28 weeks of gestation were capable of being born alive. Where the life of child in utero was ended before this gestation, evidence was presented and considered to determine whether or not the child was capable of being born alive.
The Abortion Law Reform Association, an abortion rights lobbying group, was formed in 1936.

In 1938, the decision in &quot;R v. Bourne&quot; allowed for further considerations to be taken into account. This case related to an abortion performed on a girl who had been raped, and extended the defence to abortion to include &quot;mental and physical wreck&quot; (Lord Justice McNaghtan). The gynaecologist concerned, Aleck Bourne, later became a founder member of the anti-abortion group, the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) in 1966.

In 1939, the Inter-Departmental Committee on Abortion, established by the Home Office and Ministry of Health, recommended a change to abortion laws but the intervention of World War II meant that all plans were shelved. Post-war, after decades of stasis, certain high-profile tragedies, including disability in unborn children caused by the thalidomide drug, and social changes brought the issue of abortion back into the political arena.

Westminster&#x27;s responsibility for criminal justice and health policy, including around abortion, on the island of Ireland was transferred to the Northern Ireland Parliament (on its formation in 1921) and the Parliament of the Irish Free State (formed in December 1922). Both legislatures took an essentially conservative position, viewing abortion as an offence against the person, or an offence of child destruction, in line with existing legislation in England and Wales.

===The 1967 Act===

The Abortion Act 1967 sought to clarify the law in Britain. Introduced by David Steel and subject to heated debate, it allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, with the added protection of free provision through the National Health Service. The Act was passed on 27 October 1967 and came into effect on 27 April 1968.

Before the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 amended the Act, the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 acted as a buffer to the Abortion Act 1967. This meant that abortions could not be carried out if the child was &quot;capable of being born alive&quot;. There was therefore no statutory limit put into the Abortion Act 1967, the limit being that which the courts decided as the time at which a child could be born alive. The &quot;C v S&quot; case in 1987 confirmed that, at that time, between 19 and 22 weeks a foetus was not capable of being born alive. The 1967 Act required that the procedure must be certified by two doctors before being performed.

===Proposals since 1967: Great Britain===
During each Parliament, several private member&#x27;s bills are generally introduced to seek to amend the law in relation to abortion. In the years following a supportive report in favour of the 1967 Act by the Lane Committee in 1974, Members of Parliament introduced four bills which have resulted in substantive debate in the House of Commons (votes are indicated in brackets with ayes followed by noes):

* &quot;Abortion (Amendment) Bill 1975&quot; – referred to a select committee (260–125);
* &quot;Abortion (Amendment) Bill 1976&quot; – referred to select committee (313–172);
* &quot;Abortion (Amendment) Bill 1979&quot; – approved at second stage (242–98) but not enacted;
* &quot;Abortion (Amendment) Bill 1988&quot; – approved at second stage (296–251) but not enacted;

In addition, in 1990, members voted on several proposed amendments to clause 34 of the &quot;Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill&quot; relating to the termination of pregnancy.

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, as enacted, lowered the term limit from 28 to 24 weeks for abortion in cases of &#x27;mental or physical injury&#x27; on the ground that medical technology had advanced sufficiently (since 1967) to justify the change but removed restrictions for late abortions in cases of risk to life, grave physical and mental injury to the woman, and the disability in the unborn child (by separating the legal effect of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 from the Abortion Act 1967).

When a further Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill (now enacted) was considered by Parliament in 2008, several votes were held on the term limit in Britain, as follows:

* Reduction from 24 weeks to 12 weeks (71 ayes, 393 noes);
* Reduction from 24 weeks to 16 weeks (84 ayes, 386 noes);
* Reduction from 24 weeks to 20 weeks (190 ayes, 331 noes); and
* Reduction from 24 weeks to 22 weeks (233 ayes, 304 noes).

Abortion rights groups strongly opposed any attempts to restrict abortion in the 2008 parliamentary debates and votes. A number of abortion rights amendments were proposed by the Labour MPs Diane Abbott, Katy Clark and John McDonnell, including &quot;NC30 Amendment of the Abortion Act 1967: Application to Northern Ireland&quot;. However, it was reported that the Labour government at the time asked MPs not to table these amendments (at least until third reading) and then used parliamentary mechanisms in order to prevent a vote; the government was, at the time, seeking to devolve policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly (which had previously voted to oppose the extension of the 1967 Act).

In 2017, the &quot;Reproductive Health (Access to Terminations) Bill&quot; was introduced by Labour Diana Johnson MP with the aim of repealing criminal law on abortion in England and Wales. However, with the call for a general election, the bill fell and no further action was taken.

Minor amendments to the Abortion Act 1967 have been introduced through government legislation, the most recent being the allowance of abortion consultations through telemedicine in the Health and Care Act 2022.

===Proposals since 1967: Northern Ireland===
Health, social care and criminal justice policy was devolved to the Northern Ireland Parliament at the time of the Abortion Act 1967&#x27;s passage at Westminster and the Parliament did not introduce abortion legislation before its suspension in 1972. Statute law was maintained unchanged under Conservative and Labour direct rule administrations and the first Northern Ireland Assembly in 1973-1974 although the law was interpreted through case law in local courts (during the 1990s) to also allow for the grounds of &quot;a risk of real and serious adverse effect on[...] [the] physical or mental health [of the woman] is either long term or permanent&quot;. From 1983 onwards, the Constitution of Ireland, covering the Republic with a territorial claim on Northern Ireland until 1998, acknowledged &quot;the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother&quot; and &quot;guaranteed in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.&quot;

The new Northern Ireland Assembly, formed in 1998 following the Good Friday Agreement, voted in June 2000 to oppose the extension of the Abortion Act 1967 to Northern Ireland; the motion was proposed by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and supported by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) which was, at the time, opposed to abortion but also emphasised an understanding of the social, economic and personal circumstances that gave rise to women choosing the option of an abortion. While health policy had been devolved again to Northern Ireland in December 1999, on the formation of the first Northern Ireland Executive, criminal law (including in relation to abortion) continued to be reserved to Parliament at Westminster until the devolution of policing and justice powers in May 2010.

Political debate around abortion issues was renewed following the opening of a private abortion clinic in Belfast in 2012, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 in the Republic, and the widespread discussion of a case of fatal foetal abnormality; several debates took place in the Northern Ireland Assembly and its members, in line with party policy and/or personal conscience, decided not to proceed with changes in the law. An amendment by DUP MLA Jim Wells to &quot;restrict lawful abortions to NHS premises, except in cases of urgency when access to NHS premises is not possible and where no fee is paid&quot; was unsuccessful. Later, as Health Minister, Jim Wells opposed abortion in cases of rape as the unborn child would be &quot;punished for what has happened by having their life terminated&quot; although he acknowledged that this would be &quot;a tragic and difficult situation&quot;.

Justice Minister David Ford (a member of the Alliance Party) issued a public consultation on amending the criminal law on abortion, which opened in October 2014 and closed in January 2015. However, Ford also wrote that &quot;it is not a debate on the wider issues of abortion law – issues often labelled as &#x27;pro-choice&#x27; and &#x27;pro-life&#x27;&quot;. The Sinn Féin deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, had initially stated his party&#x27;s opposition to abortion and noted that the party had &quot;resisted any attempt to bring the British 1967 Abortion Act to the North.&quot; At its 2015 annual conference, Sinn Féin adopted a policy of allowing abortion under certain circumstances such as fatal foetal abnormality; this was superseded by a newer and more liberal policy adopted at its 2018 conference.

In February 2016, during debates on the &quot;Justice (No.2) Bill&quot;, the Assembly considered and debated an amendment to allow for abortion in cases of pregnancies caused by sexual crime (which was rejected by 64 notes to 32 ayes), and an amendment to allow for abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality (which was rejected by 59 noes to 40 ayes). Sinn Féin and the Green Party voted in favour of both proposals whereas the DUP and the SDLP supported the existing law and members of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Alliance Party voted on conscience. The &quot;Abortion (Fatal Foetal Abnormality) Bill&quot; was introduced by David Ford, as a backbench MLA, in December 2016 but fell on the suspension of the Assembly in January 2017.

In the 2017 UK general election, the Labour Party manifesto under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn MP stated: &quot;Labour will continue to ensure a woman&#x27;s right to choose a safe, legal abortion – and we will work with the Assembly to extend that right to women in Northern Ireland.&quot; The election resulted in a confidence and supply agreement between the Conservative Party and the (DUP). The Conservative Government, in June 2017, made a commitment to provide free abortion services in England for women from Northern Ireland due to pressure from Conservative MPs. The Labour Party commitment was, in effect, delivered through private member&#x27;s amendments enacted in the Northern Ireland Executive (Formation) Act 2019, which repealed the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (sections 58 and 59) in October 2019. The political context was also changed by legal challenges, the repeal of the Eighth Amendment in the Republic in 2018 (supported by Sinn Féin), and the SDLP&#x27;s decision to consider abortion as a matter of conscience.

Shortly after the introduction of the Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020, the newly restored Northern Ireland Assembly voted – with 46 members in favour and 40 against – to reject &quot;the imposition of abortion legislation that extends to all non-fatal disabilities, including Down&#x27;s syndrome.&quot; Following this vote, the &quot;Severe Fetal Impairment Abortion (Amendment) Bill&quot; – to remove the grounds for abortion for non-fatal disabilities – was introduced by DUP MLA Paul Givan in February 2021. It reached its consideration stage in December 2021 but MLAs decided – by 45 votes to 43 – against the main proposal in the Bill at that stage.

== Great Britain ==
The main legislation on abortion in England, Scotland and Wales is the Abortion Act 1967, as amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. In Great Britain, abortion is generally allowed for socio-economic reasons during the first 24 weeks of the pregnancy (a later term limit than most other countries in Europe), and after this point for medical reasons.

=== England and Wales ===
The Offences against the Person Act 1861, in England and Wales, prohibits administering drugs or using instruments to procure an abortion and procuring drugs or other items to cause an abortion although subsequent law has provided for a range of grounds which allow abortion to be widely available.

The Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 amended the law in England and Wales to create the offence of child destruction – in cases where any person &quot;who, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, by any wilful act causes a child to die before it has an existence independent of its mother&quot;. For the purposes of this Act, a child whose mother has been pregnant for 28 weeks is deemed &quot;capable of being born alive&quot;. The 1929 Act also provides a defence where it is proved that causing the death of the child was &quot;done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother.&quot;

The Abortion Act 1967 originally permitted abortion &quot;by a registered medical practitioner if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith&quot; on the following grounds:

* a risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family; or
* a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be &quot;seriously handicapped&quot;.

The Act came into operation in 1968, and originally applied a term limit of 28 weeks, in line with the Infant Life Preservation Act. It was subsequently amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, to allow for the following grounds:

* Ground A – risk to the life of the pregnant woman;
* Ground B – to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman;
* Ground C – risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman (up to 24 weeks in the pregnancy);
* Ground D – risk of injury to the physical or mental health of any existing children of the family of the pregnant woman (up to 24 weeks in the pregnancy);
* Ground E – substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped;
* Ground F – to save the life of the pregnant woman; or
* Ground G – to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman in an emergency.

The amendment therefore allowed for a reduction in the term limit to 24 weeks for Ground C and Ground D with the law changing to reflect advances in technology to enable premature children to be born alive earlier in a pregnancy. However, no term limit was applied to other grounds and abortion was permitted throughout the pregnancy in these cases. The changes took effect in April 1991.

Abortion law was not devolved to the National Assembly for Wales under Government of Wales Act 1998 and was specifically reserved to the UK Parliament via the Government of Wales Act 2006.

In April 2024 a cross-party group of MPs put forward amendments to the current abortion law in England and Wales to decriminalise abortion up to 24 weeks and ensure that future legislation and guidance protects the right to an abortion. An amendment proposed that abortion be entirely decriminalised for women, whereby the 24-week limit and the requirement for approval by two doctors would remain but if the time limit is not kept to the woman would not be prosecuted, though criminal sanctions would still apply to doctors and midwives involved in abortion beyond 24-weeks. A different amendment proposed decriminalising abortion up to 24-weeks by making it an automatic right for women and allowing it to be carried out and authorised by an approved clinician if a woman requests it.

=== Scotland ===

Abortion became an offence in Scotland with the passing of the Abortion Act 1967 and refers to &quot;any rule of law relating to the procurement of abortion&quot;. Prior to 1967, there was no offence of abortion in Scotland; however, if harm occurred consequent to an abortion, various offences could have applied with abortion forming part of the description of the elements forming the offence on the petition or indictment presented to a court.

The Scotland Act 1998, which established the Scottish Parliament, reserved abortion law to the UK Parliament but it was subsequently devolved through the Scotland Act 2016. The Abortion Act 1967 remains in place.

=== Interpretation ===
Section 58 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 reads as follows and prohibits administering drugs or using instruments to cause a miscarriage:

Section 59 of that Act reads as follows and prohibits the procurement of drugs or other items to cause a miscarriage:

The following terms in the 1861 Act may be interpreted as follows:
* Unlawfully – for the purposes of sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, and any rule of law relating to the procurement of abortion, anything done with intent to procure a woman&#x27;s miscarriage (or in the case of a woman carrying more than one foetus, her miscarriage of any foetus) is unlawfully done unless authorised by section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 and, in the case of a woman carrying more than one foetus, anything done with intent to procure her miscarriage of any foetus is authorised by the said section 1 if the ground for termination of the pregnancy specified in subsection (1)(d) of the said section 1 applies in relation to any foetus and the thing is done for the purpose of procuring the miscarriage of that foetus, or any of the other ground for termination of the pregnancy specified in the said section 1 applies;
* Felony and misdemeanour – see the Criminal Law Act 1967;
* Mode of trial – the offences under section 58 and 59 are indictable-only offences;
* Sentence – an offence under section 58 is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any shorter term and an offence under section 59 is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

A death of a person in being which is caused by an unlawful attempt to procure an abortion, is at least manslaughter.

The following terms in the 1967 Act may be interpreted as follows:
* The law relating to abortion – in England and Wales, this means sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and any rule of law relating to the procurement of abortion. and in Scotland, this means any rule of law relating to the procurement of abortion;
* Terminated by a registered medical practitioner includes a procedure supervised by a medical practitioner – see Royal College of Nursing of the UK v DHSS [1981] AC 800, [1981] 2 WLR 279, [1981] 1 All ER 545, [1981] Crim LR 322, HL;
* Place where termination must be carried out – see sections 1(3) to (4);
* The opinion of two registered medical practitioners – see section 1(4);
* Good faith – see R v Smith (John Anthony James), 58 Cr App R 106, CA;
* Determining the risk of injury in ss. (a) &amp; (b) – see section 1(2);
* Risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman – In &quot;R v British Broadcasting Corporation, ex parte ProLife Alliance&quot;, Lord Justice Laws said: &quot;There is some evidence that many doctors maintain that the continuance of a pregnancy is always more dangerous to the physical welfare of a woman than having an abortion, a state of affairs which is said to allow a situation of &quot;de facto&quot; abortion on demand to prevail.&quot;

==Northern Ireland==
===Statute law before 2019===
Before significant changes in 2019, there were two main laws on abortion in Northern Ireland:
*the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (sections 58 and 59) prohibited attempts to cause a miscarriage;
*the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 (sections 25 and 26) provided an exception for acting &quot;in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother&quot; and also created the offence of child destruction i.e. to cause a child to die &quot;before it has an existence independent of its mother&quot;.

===Case law before 2019===
Between 1993 and 1999, a series of court cases had interpreted the law as also allowing for abortion in cases where, for the pregnant woman, &quot;there is a risk of real and serious adverse effect on her physical or mental health, which is either long term or permanent&quot;.

In &quot;Northern Ireland Health and Social Services Board v A and Others&quot; [1994] NIJB 1, Lord Justice MacDermott said that he was &quot;satisfied that the statutory phrase, &#x27;for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother&#x27; does not relate only to some life-threatening situation. Life in this context means that physical or mental health or well-being of the mother and the doctor&#x27;s act is lawful where the continuance of the pregnancy would adversely affect the mental or physical health of the mother. The adverse effect must however be a real and serious one and there will always be a question of fact and degree whether the perceived effect of non-termination is sufficiently grave to warrant terminating the unborn child.&quot;

In &quot;Western Health and Social Services Board v CMB and the Official Solicitor&quot; (1995, unreported), Mr Justice Pringle stated that &quot;the adverse effect must be permanent or long-term and cannot be short term ... in most cases the adverse effect would need to be a probable risk of non-termination but a possible risk might be sufficient if the imminent death of the mother was a risk in question&quot;.

In &quot;Family Planning Association of Northern Ireland v Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety&quot; (October 2004), Lord Justice Nicholson stated that &quot;it is unlawful to procure a miscarriage where the foetus is abnormal but viable, unless there is a risk that the mother may die or is likely to suffer long-term harm, which is serious, to her physical or mental health&quot;. In the same case, Lord Justice Sheil stated that &quot;termination of a pregnancy based solely on abnormality of the foetus is unlawful and cannot lawfully be carried out in this jurisdiction&quot;.

In November 2015, Lord Justice Horner made a declaration of incompatibility under the Human Rights Act 1998 to the effect that Northern Ireland&#x27;s law on abortion (specifically its lack of provision in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest) could not be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights i.e. a right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence; the convention also protects a right to life in Article 2. In June 2017, the declaration of incompatibility was quashed by the Court of Appeal on the grounds that &quot;a broad margin of appreciation must be accorded to the state&quot; and &quot;a fair balance has been struck by the law as it presently stands until the legislature decides otherwise&quot;. In June 2018, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that the law of Northern Ireland was incompatible with the right to respect for private and family life, insofar as the law prohibited abortion in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality. However, the court did not restore the declaration of incompatibility as it also held that the claimant did not have standing to bring the proceedings and accordingly the court had no jurisdiction to make a declaration of incompatibility reflect its view on the compatibility issues. The judgments of the Supreme Court acknowledged that the court lacked jurisdiction to issue a declaration of incompatibility but included a non-binding opinion that an incompatibility existed, and that a future case in which the applicant had the necessary standing would be likely to succeed. It also urged the authorities &quot;responsible for ensuring the compatibility of Northern Ireland law with the Convention rights&quot; to &quot;recognise and take account of these conclusions ... by considering whether and how to amend the law&quot;.

=== Changes in law: 2019–2020 ===
The law on abortion in Northern Ireland was changed by Parliament during a suspension of the Northern Ireland Executive, which took place between 2017 and 2020. Recommendations to liberalise abortion law in Northern Ireland were published in February 2018 by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in the report of its Inquiry concerning the United Kingdom (under Article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women).

The Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019, enacted on 24 July 2019, extended the deadline for the restoration of the Executive to 21 October 2019. Under a private member&#x27;s amendment introduced by Stella Creasy MP, if an Executive were not restored by that date, the Act would:

* require the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to implement recommendations regarding abortion made in the CEDAW report;
* repeal sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 under the law of Northern Ireland; and
* require the Secretary of State, by regulation, to make further changes in the law for complying with the recommendations with those regulations coming into force on 31 March 2020.

On 21 October 2019, as a result of the Executive not being restored, sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 Act were repealed. Legal protection for the life of a child who was &quot;capable of being born alive&quot; continued under the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945.

The Executive was restored in January 2020 but legislation on abortion continued to be implemented through Westminster. The Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020 were laid before Parliament on 25 March 2020 and took effect on 31 March 2020. The Regulations allowed for abortion in Northern Ireland in the following circumstances:

* where the pregnancy has not exceeded its twelfth week;
* a risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman (up to a term limit of 24 weeks);
* a risk to life or risk of grave permanent injury to physical or mental health of the pregnant woman;
* a severe fetal impairment – &quot;a substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such physical or mental impairment as to be seriously disabled&quot; (with no term limit); or
* a fatal fetal abnormality – &quot;a substantial risk that the death of the fetus is likely before, during or shortly after birth&quot; (with no term limit).

A person who intentionally terminates or procures the termination of a pregnancy other than in accordance with the Regulations commits an offence; this does not apply to a pregnant woman or where the act which caused the termination was done in good faith for the purpose only of saving the woman&#x27;s life or preventing grave permanent injury. The 1945 Act remains in law, including the offence of child destruction, although this no longer applies to a pregnant woman, or a registered medical professional acting in accordance with the Regulations.

The Regulations were replaced by the Abortion (Northern Ireland) (No. 2) Regulations 2020, which were materially the same with minor corrections and came into force on 14 May 2020. In May 2022, just over two years after the change in the law, it was reported that abortion clinics and treatments available in Northern Ireland were limited and women seeking to have abortions continued to travel to Great Britain (mainly England). By 2024, abortion services were now available in all five hospital trusts in Northern Ireland, enabling the majority of demand to be met locally.

==Political party approaches==
Abortion, as with other sensitive issues, is regarded as a matter of conscience within the main political parties in Great Britain. Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Scottish National Party representatives, for example, considered and individually decided to vote for or against several proposed changes in the term limit in 2008.

While active the Women&#x27;s Equality Party supported removing abortion from criminal law and supported safe access to abortions.

Minor British political parties which oppose abortion include the Heritage Party, Britain First and the Scottish Family Party. 

In Northern Ireland, for the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), and the Alliance Party, abortion is also a matter of conscience, in line with the approach at Westminster. The SDLP previously advocated an anti-abortion formal party position, including opposition to the extension of the Abortion Act 1967 to Northern Ireland; this was changed by the party&#x27;s membership to a conscience approach in May 2018.

The Democratic Unionist Party and Traditional Unionist Voice supported the pre-2019 law on abortion and opposed the legislative changes introduced in 2020 through the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Act. DUP MLA Paul Givan introduced the Severe Fetal Impairment Abortion (Amendment) Bill in February 2021, which sought to remove the ground for an abortion in cases of a severe disability in the unborn child (e.g. Down&#x27;s Syndrome), which was supported by several representatives from other political parties on grounds of conscience.

Sinn Féin policy, as approved by its annual conference in June 2018, is for abortion to be available &quot;where a woman&#x27;s life, [physical] health or mental health is at risk and in cases of fatal foetal abnormality&quot; and &quot;without specific indication ... through a GP led service in a clinical context as determined by law and licensing practice for a limited gestational period&quot;. The party previously held a more conservative position, for example in 2007 opposing the extension of the 1967 Act and preferring an approach to crisis pregnancy which involved comprehensive sex education, full access to affordable childcare, and comprehensive support services including include financial support for single parents.

Following the policy decisions in 2018 by Sinn Féin and the SDLP, a new political party - Aontú - was formed with a policy of opposing abortion and upholding &quot;the right to life of everyone irrespective of age, gender, race, creed, abilities or stage of development.&quot; Aontú has advocated for a &quot;humane and compassionate response&quot; to unwanted pregnancies, including economic support to take mothers out of poverty, pain relief being provided for the unborn child after 20 weeks of gestation, medical care for children who are born after an abortion procedure, and a legislative ban on abortion in cases of disability and gender selection.

The Green Party in Northern Ireland and People Before Profit support the full decriminalisation of abortion (i.e. that it should be made available for any reason).

==Faith perspectives==
As in other countries, there is a wide range of personal individual views on abortion within church denominations.

===Roman Catholic===
The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states that human life &quot;must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception&quot; and that from the first moment of existence, &quot;a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person – among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.&quot; The Church has affirmed &quot;the moral evil of every procured abortion&quot; since the 1st century AD and describes direct abortion &quot;willed either as an end or a means&quot; as gravely contrary to the moral law. Pope John Paul II reaffirmed the &quot;Catechism&quot; in his papal encyclical (&quot;The Gospel of Life&quot;) in 1995, which taught on &quot;bringing about a transformation of culture&quot; in relation to abortion and the value of human life, including extensive care and support for pregnant women, their children and their families.

During his pastoral visit to Great Britain in 1982, John Paul II remarked: &quot;I support with all my heart those who recognize and defend the law of God which governs human life. We must never forget that every person, from the moment of conception to the last breath, is a unique child of God and has a right to life. This right should be defended by the attentive care of the medical and nursing professions and by the protection of the law.&quot; Pope Benedict XVI, on his state visit to the United Kingdom in 2010, stated: &quot;Life is a unique gift, at every stage from conception until natural death, and it is God’s alone to give and to take.&quot;

===Anglican===
The Church of England combines strong opposition to abortion with a recognition that there can be &quot;strictly limited&quot; conditions under which it may be morally preferable to any available alternative. This is based on its view that the foetus is a human life with the potential to develop relationships, think, pray, choose and love. The Church has suggested that the case for further reductions of the time limit for abortions should be &quot;sympathetically considered on the basis of advances in neo-natal care&quot; and has stated that every possible support, especially by church members, needs to be given to those who are pregnant in difficult circumstances.

Writing on the 40th anniversary of the 1967 Act, in 2007, the then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams commented that most parliamentarians who voted for the Act &quot;did so in the clear belief that they were making provision for extreme and tragic situations&quot; but that its implementation since then demonstrated unintended consequences. The strengthening of the language of &#x27;foetal rights&#x27; (i.e. that &quot;the pregnant woman who smokes or drinks heavily is widely regarded as guilty of infringing the rights of her unborn child&quot;) could be contrasted with &quot;the liberty of the pregnant woman herself to perform the actions that will terminate a pregnancy.&quot;

The Church of Ireland – a province of the Anglican Communion alongside the Church of England – affirms that &quot;every human being is created with intrinsic dignity in the image of God with the right to life.&quot; It has opposed the &quot;extreme abortion legislation&quot; imposed on Northern Ireland, asked that legislation is developed that safeguards the well-being of both the mother and unborn child, and encouraged its members to provide more support to mothers during pregnancy, particularly during times of crisis. In relation to potential grounds for abortion, the Church recognises that there are &quot;exceptional circumstances of strict and undeniable medical necessity where an abortion should be an option (or more rarely a necessity).&quot;

===Presbyterian===
The General Assembly of the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland regards the foetus as &quot;from the beginning, an independent human being&quot; and therefore it can be threatened &quot;only in the case of threat to maternal life, and that after the exhaustion of all alternatives&quot;.

The Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the largest Protestant denomination in Northern Ireland, is strongly anti-abortion, and maintains that abortion should only be permitted in exceptional circumstances (e.g. where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother) subject to the most stringent safeguards. The Church has affirmed the sanctity of human life, that human life begins at conception, and that complex medical and social issues such as abortion need to be handled with sensitivity and compassion.

===Methodist===
The Conference of the Methodist Church of Great Britain stated in 1976 that the human foetus had &quot;an inviolable right to life&quot; and that abortion should never be seen as an alternative to contraception. The Church also recognised that foetus is &quot;totally dependent&quot; on his or her mother for at least the first twenty weeks of its life and said that the mother has &quot;a total right to decide whether or not to continue the pregnancy.&quot; The Church has supported counselling opportunities for mothers so that they fully understand the decision, and the alternatives to abortion.

Its sister church, the Methodist Church in Ireland, is opposed to what it describes as &quot;abortion on demand&quot; and urges support and resources for those who have an unplanned pregnancy. The Church recognises that there are complex situations &quot;in which early termination of pregnancy should be available&quot; and considers that these include &quot;when a mother&#x27;s life is at risk, when a pregnancy is the result of a sexual crime, or in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.&quot;

===Others===
The smaller Protestant churches are generally conservative on the issue of abortion.

Congregations and members of major non-Christian religions in the UK likewise provide pastoral support for women, families and children whose circumstances are affected by crisis pregnancies and abortion, in a range of ways. Views on the morality and potential grounds for abortion vary within Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, and Judaism.

==Campaign groups==
Prominent campaign groups which are supportive of a conservative policy include Both Lives Matter, Christian Action Research and Education (CARE), Evangelical Alliance, Life, Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC) and the UK Life League. Campaigning organisations in support of a liberal policy include Amnesty International, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), the Family Planning Association (FPA), Marie Stopes, MSI Reproductive Choices, and Humanists UK.

Abortion policy in Northern Ireland was the subject of intense discussion and campaigning in the decade leading up to changes in the law in 2019 and 2020. The issue is debated less frequently in Great Britain, where the law was last substantially changed in 1990.

==Crown dependencies==
Although Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man are not part of the United Kingdom, as they are part of the Common Travel Area, people resident on these islands who choose to have an abortion have travelled to the UK since the Abortion Act 1967.

===Jersey===
It is lawful in Jersey to have an abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if the woman is in &quot;distress&quot; and requests it; in the first 24 weeks in case of foetal abnormalities; and at any time to save the woman&#x27;s life or prevent serious permanent injury to her health. The criteria were established in the Termination of Pregnancy (Jersey) Law 1997.

===Guernsey===
The law of Guernsey allows abortion under the same grounds as in Great Britain: at any time to save the woman&#x27;s life, prevent grave permanent injury to her health, or in case of significant foetal impairment; and in the first 24 weeks of gestation in case of &quot;risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family&quot;. As in Great Britain, the latter ground is considered to allow &quot;de facto&quot; elective abortion.

The conditions are specified in the Abortion (Guernsey) Law, 1997. As originally enacted, the law set a gestational limit of 24 weeks in case of foetal impairment and 12 weeks for risk to health greater than terminating the pregnancy, required the approval of two medical practitioners, and required that the abortion take place at Princess Elizabeth Hospital. The law was amended, effective from 2022, to remove the gestational limit for foetal impairment and increase the other limit to 24 weeks, to reduce the required approval to only one medical practitioner, to remove the location requirement, to allow nurses and midwives to perform abortions, and to decriminalise the act of a woman attempting to or succeeding in ending her own pregnancy outside of a medical setting.

The Guernsey law of 1997 and its amendment of 2022 do not apply to Alderney and Sark, which are also part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey but continue to apply an earlier law, in French, identical to the Offences against the Person Act 1861 of England and Wales, which does not explicitly mention any legal ground for abortion. However, the judicial decision &quot;Rex v Bourne&quot; in England and Wales clarified that the law always implicitly allowed abortion at least to save the woman&#x27;s life, and the decision extended it also to preserve her health. It is unclear whether Alderney and Sark apply only the original legal principle or also the extension by the judicial decision.

In practice, abortions are provided in Alderney under the same conditions as in Guernsey, as health services in Alderney operate under Guernsey law. To clarify the legal situation, in 2022 the States of Alderney passed an abortion law identical to the one in Guernsey, but it awaits a regulation to establish the effective date.

===Isle of Man===
Since 24 May 2019, it is lawful in the Isle of Man to have an abortion during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy at will, then until the 24th week, so long as criteria specified by the act are met, and then onwards if there is a serious risk of grave injury or death. Abortion is governed by the Abortion Reform Act 2019.

==Statistics==
===Total number of abortions (including historical estimates)===

===Legal abortions by ground===
Statistics for legal abortions are published annually by the Department of Health and Social Care, for England and Wales, NHS Scotland, and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. Where there is only a small number of abortions for a particular ground, the number is not published by statisticians to avoid the risk of disclosing the identity of the persons involved.

Legal abortions were carried out on the following grounds in England and Wales in 2020:

Nearly all (99.9%) of abortions carried out under Ground C alone were reported as being performed because of a risk to the woman&#x27;s mental health and were classified as F99 (mental disorder, not otherwise specified) under the ICD-10 classification system.

Legal abortions were carried out on the following grounds in Scotland in the same year:

In Northern Ireland, the total number of terminations in 2017–2018 was 12, followed by 8 in 2018–2019, and 22 in 2019–2020. As indicated above, for most of that time, abortions were permitted there if the act was to save the life of the mother, or if there was a risk of permanent and serious damage to the mental or physical health of the mother.

In 2020, a total of 371 women travelling from Northern Ireland received abortions in England and Wales:
*367 – due to risk of injury to physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; and
*4 – due to physical or mental abnormality in the unborn child.

In the same year, 194 women travelling from the Republic of Ireland received abortions in England and Wales:
*131 – due to risk of injury to physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; and
*63 – due to physical or mental abnormality in the unborn child.

The number of pregnant women from the island of Ireland travelling for an abortion was previously much more significant although this decreased following changes in legislation in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, and travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scottish statistics for abortion record the place of residence of the pregnant woman within Scotland (i.e. an NHS board or a local government area); these figures includes temporary addresses for students and a small number of women travelling to Scotland from elsewhere.

==== Ethnicity ====
The broad multi-ethnic group of those getting an abortion is as follows:

By individual ethnic group, including numbers and those which do not state an ethnicity:
===Legal abortions by gestation===
A significant majority of abortions in Great Britain take place at less than 10 weeks of gestation. The numbers and percentages in England and Wales, Scotland, and Great Britain overall, were as follows in 2020. Information on gestation and abortion is not available in Northern Ireland for the same year.

===Legal abortions by nation/region===
In 2020, the region with the largest number of abortions was London followed by South East England, the West Midlands and North West England. Statistics on abortion recorded at a regional level or national level (for England, Wales and Scotland individually) relate to residents. Abortions for non-residents are also recorded for England and Wales (collectively) although these were lower than usual (at 943 abortions) in that year due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information for Northern Ireland is recorded by financial year rather than calendar year, with 22 abortions recorded in 2019–2020.

===Abortion offences===
Abortions carried out for grounds outside those permitted in law (e.g. in most cases after the 24-week term limit, or where appropriate consent has not been given) continue to be unlawful in each jurisdiction of the UK – under the Offences against the Person Act 1861 in England and Wales, Scottish common law, and the Northern Ireland Regulations. The Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 and the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 also outlaw child destruction in cases where the life of the unborn child would have been viable outside the womb.

With the increasing availability of medicines for abortion, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has stated that medicines are not ordinary consumer goods and have the potential to cause harm as well as cure, and selling mifepristone with no medical qualifications is illegal and can be extremely dangerous for patients.

Home Office statistics for England and Wales recorded 224 offences in total for procuring an illegal abortion in 1900–1909, which increased to 527 in the subsequent decade, 651 in the 1920s, and 1,028 in the 1930s (although figures for 1939 are unavailable). The number of offences increased significantly from 1942 onwards, at the same time as the arrival of American military personnel during the Second World War, rising to 649 in 1944, and totalling 3,088 throughout the 1940s. The trend decreased but remained significant with 2,040 offences from 1950 to 1959 inclusive and 2,592 in the 1960s. However, there was a decrease from 212 offences in 1970 to three in 1979, alongside the implementation of the 1967 Act, and offences remained at single figures over the rest of the 20th Century. From 1931 to 2002, there were also 109 recorded cases of child destruction in the jurisdiction, as defined by the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929.

From 2002–2003 to 2008–2009, there were 30 cases of child destruction and 46 cases of illegal abortion in England and Wales followed by 61 cases of illegal abortion and 80 cases of child destruction in the subsequent decade (between 2009–2010 and 2019–2020 inclusive). Guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service lists procuring an abortion (unlawfully) as a child abuse offence and notes that some unlawful abortions may be carried out as honour-based crimes, which are committed to punish women for &quot;alleged or perceived breaches of the family and/or community&#x27;s code of behaviour.&quot;

Abortion and child destruction offences have historically only occasionally been recorded in Northern Ireland – a possible effect of the deterrent provided in law and the policing of a smaller jurisdiction. Between 1998 and 2018, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Police Service of Northern Ireland recorded 17 cases of procuring an illegal abortion and three cases of child destruction. In several years within that timeframe, no offences of this type were recorded.

In the absence of statute law on abortion in Scotland before 1967, medical and legal practice varied locally. General population comparisons between jurisdictions would indicate that Scotland would record fewer offences than England and Wales and more than Northern Ireland although figures are not routinely published. In 2022, calls were made to formalise an offence of child destruction in Scotland, to ensure a more consistent approach in line with its neighbouring jurisdictions.

===Trends since 1967===


Post 1967 there was a rapid increase in the annual number of legal abortions, and a decline in sepsis and death due to illegal abortions. In 1978 121,754 abortions were performed on women resident in the UK, and 28,015 on non-resident women. The rate of increase fell from the early 1970s and actually dipped from 1991 to 1995 before rising again. The age group with the highest number of abortions per 1000 is amongst those aged 20–24. 2006 statistics for England and Wales revealed that 48% of abortions occurred to women over the age of 25, 29% were aged 20–24; 21% aged under 20 and 2% under 16.

In 2004, there were 185,415 abortions in England and Wales. 87% of abortions were performed at 12 weeks or less and 1.6% (or 2,914 abortions) occurred after 20 weeks. Abortion is free to residents; 82% of abortions were carried out by the public tax-funded National Health Service.

The overwhelming majority of abortions (95% in 2004 for England and Wales) were certified under the statutory ground of risk of injury to the mental or physical health of the pregnant woman.

By 2009, the number of abortions had risen to 189,100. Of this number, 2,085 are as a result of doctors deciding that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would have such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously disabled.

In a written answer to Jim Allister, the Northern Ireland health minister Edwin Poots disclosed that 394 abortions were carried out in Northern hospitals for the period 2005/06 to 2009/10 with the footnote that reasons for abortions were not gathered centrally.

190,800 abortions were notified as taking place in England and Wales in 2013. 0.2% fewer than in 2012; 185,331 were to residents of England and Wales. The age-standardised rate was 15.9 abortions per 1,000 resident women aged 15–44 years; this rate increased from 11.0 in 1973, peaked at 17.9 in 2007, and fell to 15.9 in 2013. For comparison, the EU average is only 4.4aabortions per 1,000 women in child-bearing age.

Since approval of abortion in the UK in 1967 to 2014, 8,745,508 abortions have been performed.

In 2018, the total abortions in England and Wales was 205,295. In this year, the abortion rate was highest for those of the age of 21, and 81% were for those who were single.

===Public opinion surveys and polls===
Opinion polling and social attitudes surveys have regularly considered public opinion in relation to abortion in Britain since at least the 1980s. The British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey has asked a number of questions about abortion over the past 40 years and has found almost unanimous support for a right to have an abortion if the woman&#x27;s health would be seriously endangered by going ahead with the pregnancy. Levels of support for abortion in a situation where the woman decides on her own she does not wish to have the child were lower, when the issue was considered in 2012, with just over six in ten (62 per cent) supporting and a third (34 per cent) opposing. However, this marked a considerable change since 1983 when 37 per cent thought the law should allow this while just over half (55 per cent) thought it should not.

The similar Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey has surveyed its respondents on abortion several times since 1998. In that year, 43% said that it was &quot;always wrong&quot; for a woman to have an abortion on economic grounds (i.e. &quot;if the family has a very low income and cannot afford any more children&quot;) with 14% saying it was &quot;not wrong at all&quot; and a variety of other responses in between. The same responses were broadly found in 2008, when a large percentage of people (39 per cent) also affirmed that an embryo was &quot;a human being at the moment of conception&quot;.

A specific set of questions, asked by the Life and Times Survey in 2016 and 2018, covered a wide range of issues around abortion and found the following levels of support for a range of potential grounds for abortion:
* 58% – fatal abnormality in unborn child;
* 54% – pregnancy caused by sexual crime;
* 46% – serious threat to health of pregnant woman;
* 45% – serious abnormality in unborn child;
* 25% – pregnant woman aged 15 (under age of consent);
* 18% – pregnant woman aged 51;
* 17% – pregnant woman prefers not to have children;
* 13% – pregnant woman who is living on low income;
* 12% – pregnant woman who has become unemployed;
* 11% – pregnant woman who is about to begin a new job.

An Amnesty International poll in 2014 also indicated that a majority of people in Northern Ireland agreed with changes in abortion law for three particular grounds i.e. where a pregnancy has occurred due to rape, or incest, or where a fatal foetal abnormality (or life-limiting condition) has been diagnosed in the unborn child.

A YouGov/&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; survey in 2005 measured British public opinion regarding the gestational age at which abortion should be permitted, with the following levels of support:
*2% – abortion being available throughout pregnancy;
*25% – maintaining the term limit of 24 weeks;
*30% – reducing the term limit to 20 weeks;
*19% – reducing the term limit to 12 weeks;
*9% – reducing the term limit to less than 12 weeks; and
*6% – abortion not being allowed at any stage.

A further 2011 poll by MORI surveyed women&#x27;s attitudes to abortion and found that:
*53% agreed that if a woman wanted an abortion, she should not have to continue with her pregnancy (compared with 22% who neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement and 17% who disagreed);
*37% agreed with the statement that &quot;too many women do not think hard enough before having an abortion&quot; (with 28% disagreeing and 26% neither agreeing nor disagreeing);
*46% disagreed with introducing more restrictions on obtaining an abortion (with 23% agreeing and 23% neither agreeing nor disagreeing).

== Crisis pregnancy advice centres ==
The BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; team investigated crisis pregnancy advice centres and found over a third gave misleading medical information or unethical advice, or both. &quot;Panorama&quot; looked into 57 crisis pregnancy advice centres advertising, of these 34 sent users to the NHS website or regulated abortion providers. Roughly 21 centres gave misleading medical information and/or unethical advice. 7 centres suggested falsely abortion could cause mental health problems, 8 centres suggested falsely abortion could cause infertility, and 5 centres suggested falsely abortion could cause increased risk of breast cancer. Leading obstetrician Dr Jonathan Lord stated &quot;There is no increased risk of serious mental illness, infertility, or breast cancer after an abortion. These centres are set up to target women who are struggling with their decision, and then give them false advice to try to sway them away from an abortion. They risk causing significant harm and damage to those especially-vulnerable patients.&quot; Jo Holmes, of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, stated the centre made biased and judgemental claims. &quot;Counselling is about being able to explore what you&#x27;re feeling in a safe place with no judgements, but any woman who went into a session like this would come out deeply traumatised.&quot;

==Approved methods==
The methods used for abortion are divided in two categories:

* Medical abortion: carried out by the administration of two pills, one that contains mifepristone (orally) and 1 to 2 days later another one containing misoprostol (orally or vaginally).
* Surgical abortion: can be carried out by either 
** Vacuum aspiration: removing the pregnancy with suction done by a tube inserted into the uterus or
** Dilation or evacuation (D&amp;E): removing the pregnancy with instruments called forceps inserted into the uterus.

The provision of different methods is dependent on the stage of the pregnancy and policies. Medical abortions are typically available for up to 12 weeks but can also be used for termination in later stages. Vacuum aspiration is provided up to 14 weeks of pregnancy whereas D&amp;E is provided after 14 weeks of pregnancy. When pregnancy progresses to after 20 weeks, the procedure becomes more complicated.

Since mifepristone was approved for use in Britain in 1991, the use of medical abortion has been on the rise continually and it is now the most commonly used method for abortion, especially for abortions in early pregnancy. In England and Wales, medical abortions accounted for 86% of all abortions from January to June 2022, the majority of which were carried out in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. In Scotland, 99.4% of all abortions were carried out medically in 2021.

=== Early medical abortion at home ===
In 2011, the BPAS lost a High Court bid to force the Health Secretary to allow women undertaking early medical abortions in England, Scotland and Wales to administer the second dose of drug treatment at home. However, this decision was later reversed in 2019, permitting women to take both pills at home up to 10 weeks gestation. The temporary changes were also linked to an increase in abortions during the COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s first year. An evaluation of this service showed that it was safe and effective, with shorter waiting times, and preferred by those who had gone through it.

On 24 February 2022, the Department of Health announced that the &quot;pills at home&quot; scheme was going to be scrapped in England. At the same time, Wales has announced that they intend to make the scheme permanent. Before deciding whether or not to make the scheme permanent, all three countries in the United Kingdom held a public consultation. MPs later voted to amend the Health and Care Bill 2022 to make the scheme permanent, allowing telemedical abortion care up to the tenth week of pregnancy.

On 12 June 2023, a woman was sentenced to over two years in prison for inducing an abortion after the legal limit through the &quot;pills by post&quot; scheme by misleading the BPAS and falsely saying she was below the 10 week cutoff (she was believed to be 28 weeks pregnant at the time). This was later reduced to 14 months suspended sentence after being sent to the Court of Appeal. This led to a number of abortion-rights advocates, women&#x27;s-rights groups, politicians and medics to call on the British government to reform its abortion laws.

== Abortions in prisons ==
The HMPPS policy (covering England and Wales) for women who wish to get an abortion while incarcerated includes that prisons are required to ensure timely access to termination support services for women requiring them. This policy also states that following a termination women must be allowed to rest, or in the case of a medical termination, pass the pregnancy in privacy.

In practice, it is difficult to determine how easily women are able to access abortion or what support women are given in relation to decisions to terminate a pregnancy. There is little research in this area.

A Freedom of Information Request to the Department of Health and Social Care (FOI-11107442) in 2017 asking how many women who reside in prison obtained abortions over the period 2006 to 2016 showed that, on average, 30 women access abortion while in prison each year.

<text>The Initial Teaching Alphabet (ITA or i.t.a.) is a variant of the Latin alphabet developed by Sir James Pitman (the grandson of Sir Isaac Pitman, inventor of a system of shorthand) in the early 1960s. It was not intended to be a strictly phonetic transcription of English sounds, or a spelling reform for English as such, but instead a practical simplified writing system which could be used to teach English-speaking children to read more easily than can be done with traditional orthography. After children had learned to read using ITA, they would then eventually move on to learn standard English spelling. Although it achieved a certain degree of popularity in the 1960s, it has fallen out of use since the 1970s.

==Details==
The ITA originally had 43 symbols, which was expanded to 44, then 45. Each symbol predominantly represented a single English sound (including affricates and diphthongs), but there were complications due to the desire to avoid making the ITA needlessly different from standard English spelling (which would make the transition from the ITA to standard spelling more difficult), and in order to neutrally represent several English pronunciations or dialects. In particular, there was no separate ITA symbol for the English unstressed schwa sound , and schwa was written with the same letters used to write full vowel sounds. There were also several different ways of writing unstressed / and consonants palatalized to , , , by suffixes. Consonants written by double letters or &quot;ck&quot;, &quot;tch&quot; etc. sequences in standard spelling were written with multiple symbols in the ITA.

The ITA symbol set includes joined letters (typographical ligatures) to replace the two-letter digraphs &quot;wh&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, and &quot;ch&quot; of conventional writing, and also ligatures for most of the long vowels. There are two distinct ligatures for the voiced and unvoiced &quot;th&quot; sounds in English, and a special merged letter for &quot;ng&quot; resembling ŋ with a loop. There is a variant of the &quot;r&quot; to end syllables, which is silent in non-rhotic accents like Received Pronunciation but not in rhotic accents like General American and Scots English (this was the 44th symbol added to the ITA).

There are two English sounds which each have more than one ITA letter whose main function is to write them. So whether the sound is written with the letters &quot;c&quot; or &quot;k&quot; in ITA depends on the way the sound is written in standard English spelling, as also whether the sound is written with the ordinary &quot;z&quot; letter or with a special backwards &quot;z&quot; letter (which replaces the &quot;s&quot; of standard spelling where it represents a voiced sound, and which visually resembles an angular form of the letter &quot;s&quot;). The backwards &quot;z&quot; occurs prominently in many plural forms of nouns and third-person singular present forms of verbs (including &quot;is&quot;).

Each of the ITA letters has a name, the pronunciation of which includes the sound that the character stands for. For example, the name of the backwards &quot;z&quot; letter is &quot;zess&quot;.

A special typeface was created for the ITA, whose characters were all lower case (its letter forms were based on Didone types such as Monotype Modern and Century Schoolbook). Where capital letters are used in standard spelling, the ITA simply used larger versions of the same lower-case characters. The following chart shows the letters of the 44-character version of the ITA, with the main pronunciation of each letter indicated by symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet beneath:

Note that &quot;d&quot; is made more distinctively different from &quot;b&quot; than is usual in standard typefaces.

Later a 45th symbol was added to accommodate accent variation, a form of diaphonemic writing. In the original set, a &quot;hook a&quot; or &quot;two-storey a&quot; (a) was used for the vowel in &quot;cat&quot; (lexical set ), and a &quot;round a&quot; or &quot;one-storey a&quot; (ɑ) for the sound in &quot;father&quot; (lexical set ). But lexical set (words such as &quot;rather&quot;, &quot;dance&quot;, and &quot;half&quot;) patterns with in some accents including Received Pronunciation, but with in others including General American. So a new character, the &quot;half-hook a&quot;, was devised, to avoid the necessity of producing separate instructional materials for speakers of different accents.

A series of international ITA conferences were held, the fourth being in Montreal in 1967.

==Decline==
Any advantage of the ITA in making it easier for children to learn to read English was often offset by some children not being able to effectively transfer their ITA-reading skills to reading standard English orthography, or being generally confused by having to deal with two alphabets in their early years of reading. Certain alternative methods (such as associating sounds with colours, so that for example when the letter &quot;c&quot; writes a sound it would be coloured with the same colour as the letter &quot;k&quot;, but when &quot;c&quot; writes an sound it could be coloured like &quot;s&quot;, as in Words in Colour and Colour Story Reading) were found to have some of the advantages of the ITA without most of the disadvantages. Though the ITA was not originally intended to dictate one particular approach to teaching reading, it was often identified with phonics methods, and after the 1960s, the pendulum of educational theory swung away from phonics. The ITA was very rarely used by the 1970s.

The ITA remains of interest in discussions about possible reforms of English spelling. There have been attempts to apply the ITA using only characters which can be found on the typewriter keyboard or in the basic ASCII character set, to avoid the use of special symbols.

<text>The Toronto Islands are a chain of 15 small islands in Lake Ontario, south of mainland Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Comprising the only group of islands in the western part of Lake Ontario, the Toronto Islands are located just offshore from the city&#x27;s downtown area, provide shelter for Toronto Harbour, and separate Toronto from the rest of Lake Ontario. The islands are home to the Toronto Island Park, the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, several private yacht clubs, a public marina, Centreville Amusement Park, a year-round residential neighbourhood, and several public beaches. The island community is the largest urban car-free community in North America. Public ferries operate year-round from Jack Layton Ferry Terminal, and privately operated water taxis operate from May to September. A pedestrian tunnel connects the mainland to the airport (which is only connected to the airport, not to any of the parks).

The Toronto Islands are a popular tourist and recreational destination. Bicycles are accommodated on the ferries at no charge and can be rented at Centre Island. Canoes, kayaks, paddle boats and stand-up paddle boards are also available for rental from May to September. A disc golf course exists on the island. The main beach is along the south shore of Centre Island, and the beach on the west shore of Centre at Hanlans Point is clothing-optional. There is ample parkland suitable for picnicking, several playgrounds, water play areas and several gardens. During the winter months people reach the lagoons and Toronto Harbour from the islands for ice skating when conditions permit.

==History==

The Toronto Islands were not originally islands but rather a series of sand-bars originating from the deposition of sand from the Scarborough Bluffs, pushed by Lake Ontario currents.

Prior to European colonization, the group of islands (then peninsula) and sandbars was considered a place of healing, leisure, and relaxation by Indigenous peoples. The then peninsula was called or &quot;Island of Hiawatha&quot; or &quot;Menecing,&quot; meaning &quot;On the Island&quot; in Ojibwe.

To the descendants of the Ojibwa, now the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, the Toronto Islands are sacred land. According to British Crown records, Treaty 13, often referred to as the Toronto Purchase of 1787 and 1805, included the Islands and compensated the Mississaugas with &quot;goods including rifle flints, 24 brass kettles, 120 mirrors, 24 laced hats and 96 gallons of rum valued at for the sale of Toronto.&quot; The Mississaugas, in a land claim settlement process started in 1986, claimed that the Islands, along with other lands, were never included in the agreement and that the compensation was inadequate. In 2010, a settlement was reached which resulted in a payment to the Mississaugas from the Government of Canada. In return, the Mississaugas relinquished their claim to the Islands and other lands in the area.

The peninsula and surrounding sand bars that now form the Toronto Islands were surveyed in 1792 by Lieutenant Joseph Bouchette of the Royal Navy. D.W. Smith&#x27;s Gazetteer recorded in 1813 that &quot;the long beach or peninsula, which affords a most delightful ride, is considered so healthy by the Indians that they resort to it whenever indisposed&quot;. Many Indigenous communities were located between the peninsula&#x27;s base and the Don River.

During the 1790s, the British built the first buildings on the island. The Gibraltar Point Blockhouse and storage structures were built at Gibraltar Point in 1794. The garrison was known as the Blockhouse Bay garrison, and it supported the garrison on the mainland. By 1800, another blockhouse and a guard house were built. These were destroyed in the Battle of York. Another garrison was built, but it was abandoned by 1823 and demolished in 1833.

The Gibraltar Point Lighthouse was constructed at Gibraltar Point, the south-western extremity of the peninsula in 1809. It is perhaps best known for the demise of its first keeper, German-born John Paul Radelmüller, whose alleged 1815 murder by soldiers from Fort York forms the basis of Toronto&#x27;s most enduring ghost story. Although the precise circumstances of his death remain a mystery, recent research has verified many aspects of the popular legend. The two soldiers charged with but ultimately acquitted of Radelmüller&#x27;s murder were John Henry and John Blueman, both of the Glengarry Light Infantry.

The peninsula was first cut off from the mainland to the east by a storm in 1852, but a breakwater was built and the channel was filled in by silt. However, on April 13, 1858, the peninsula became an island permanently by a violent storm that cut a wide channel. The same storm destroyed two hotels on the island.

After the peninsula became an island, the Hanlan family were among the first year-round inhabitants, settling at Gibraltar Point in 1862. In 1867, the City of Toronto acquired the Islands from the federal government, and the land was divided into lots, allowing seasonal cottages, outdoor amusement areas and summer resort hotels to be built. The west side of the island became a destination for the people of Toronto and the first summer cottage community was built there. In 1878, a hotel was built by John Hanlan at the north-west tip of the island and soon after the area became known as Hanlan&#x27;s Point. The family built Hanlan&#x27;s Point Amusement Park in the 1880s. John&#x27;s son, Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Hanlan, earned international recognition as a rower before taking over his father&#x27;s business. Other notable families on the Islands included the Durnans (James Durnan was the Gibraltar Point Lighthouse keeper in 1832) and the Wards (David Ward settled on the eastern end in 1830).

At the same time as Hanlan&#x27;s Point was developing as a summer suburb of Toronto, developments were going on elsewhere on the Islands. Along the lakefront of Centre Island, large Victorian summer homes were built by Toronto&#x27;s leading families looking for refuge from the summer heat and drawn by the prestigious Royal Canadian Yacht Club, which had moved to a location on the harbour side of RCYC Island in 1881. By contrast, the Ward&#x27;s Island community began in the 1880s as a tent community. William E. Ward built the Ward&#x27;s Hotel and a few houses and rented tents to visitors.

The records of the School Board indicate that a one-room school existed on donated land near the Gibraltar Lighthouse in approximately 1888 but it was not necessarily open every day, particularly in winter. The school became permanent in 1896, though still with a single teacher. After it burned down a new school was built; there were 52 students in 1909 and 630 by 1954. As of 2018, the Island Public/Natural Science School operates classes for Junior Kindergarten to grade 6, a residential natural science program (which began in 1960) for visiting grade 5 and 6 students and a day care centre for children ages 2–5.

In 1899, there was a colony of eight summer tenants on Ward&#x27;s Island paying $10 rent for the season. By 1913, the number of tents pitched had increased to the point where the city felt it necessary to organize the community into streets, and the tents eventually evolved into a seasonal cottage community.

In 1894, a land reclamation project by the Toronto Ferry Company created space to expand the Hanlan&#x27;s Point Amusement Park at Hanlan&#x27;s Point. In 1897, the Hanlan&#x27;s Point Stadium was built alongside the amusement park for the Toronto Maple Leaf baseball team. The stadium was rebuilt several times over the years, and in 1914, Babe Ruth hit his first professional home run into the waters of Lake Ontario from this stadium. In the 1920s, the Maple Leaf team moved to a new stadium on the mainland.

From 1915 to 1916, a temporary wooden hangar was built at the beach by the Curtiss Flying School. This floatplane aerodrome was used for flight training for World War I.

In 1937, construction started on a new airport on the site of the park and stadium. The construction of the airport on infill led to the demolition of the stadium and most of the amusement park. It also meant that the cottage community at Hanlan&#x27;s Point needed to be relocated. The residents were given the choice of either moving their cottages further south at Hanlan&#x27;s Point or resettling on Algonquin Island. Originally, Algonquin Island was simply a sandbar known as Sunfish Island that was expanded by land reclamation operations. In 1938, streets were laid out to accommodate 31 cottages that were moved by barge from Hanlan&#x27;s Point.

The airport opened in 1939, formally named the &quot;Port George VI Island Airport&quot;, after the reigning monarch of the time. During the first few years of the Second World War, expatriate Norwegian (RNAF) pilots-in-training used the Toronto Island Airport as a training field for both fighter and bomber pilots. Several accidents, including one where a pilot under instruction clipped the funnel and mast of the island ferry boat &quot;Sam McBride&quot; and crashed, led to the training school being moved north to Muskoka, Ontario. A park on the mainland called Little Norway Park commemorates this period.

In 1947, Toronto City Council approved the year-round occupancy of the Islands to help cope with housing shortages after World War Two, an emergency measure meant to expire in 1968. At its peak in the 1950s, the Island residential community extended from Ward&#x27;s Island to Hanlan&#x27;s Point and was made up of some 630 cottages and homes, in addition to amenities including a movie theatre, a bowling alley, stores, hotels, and dance halls. Not long after its creation in 1953, Metropolitan Toronto Council undertook to remove the community and replace it with public parkland. The construction of the Gardiner Expressway had removed many acres of recreational land along the Toronto waterfront, and the Islands lands were to replace the acreage. In 1955, after the city had transferred the lands to Metropolitan Toronto (&quot;Metro&quot;), the new Metro Parks Department started to demolish homes and cottages whose leases had expired or whose leaseholders had surrendered. In 1959, the Metro Parks Department opened Far Enough Farm, and in 1967 opened the Centreville Amusement Park, along with a new public marina. In 1971, Metro Parks opened a new ferry terminal at the foot of Bay Street. Unlike the previous terminal, no waiting room was provided.

By 1963, all Islanders willing to leave the island had departed and the remaining residents started to fight the plans of Metro Council to remove their homes. While demolitions proceeded, community alderman David Rotenberg pushed the Islanders&#x27; cause and the number of demolitions dwindled. In 1969, the Toronto Islands&#x27; Residents Association (TIRA) was formed. By 1970, 250 homes on Ward&#x27;s and Algonquin Islands had escaped the bulldozer. The 1970s saw no further demolitions as the Metro Parks plans were delayed by year-to-year leases and the election of Toronto City Councillors who were more sympathetic to the Islanders&#x27; situation. In 1973, City Council voted 17–2 to preserve the community and transfer Island lands back to the city. However, Metro Council remained opposed and the Islanders started legal challenges to Metro&#x27;s plans in 1974 to delay plans of expropriation. By 1978, Metro Council had won several legal battles and had obtained writs of possession for the remaining 250 homes. At the time, a minority provincial Progressive Conservative government was in place with both the Liberal and NDP opposition parties in favour of the Islanders. The Islanders appealed to the provincial government, winning more time when the province agreed to act as mediator between the City and Islanders and Metro.

Matters came to a head on July 28, 1980, when a sheriff sent to serve eviction notices to remaining residents was met at the Algonquin Island Bridge by a crowd of community members, whose leaders persuaded the sheriff to withdraw. On July 31, the community won the right to challenge the 1974 evictions, but the Islanders lost the challenge when the Supreme Court ruled that the city had a right to evict them. The province started a formal inquiry into the Toronto Islands headed by Barry Swadron. On December 18, 1981, the province of Ontario passed a law legalizing the Islanders to stay until 2005. This kept the lands in Metro&#x27;s ownership, to be leased to the City who would lease it to the Islanders. Wrangling over the terms of the lease payments to Metro took several years. In 1993, Premier of Ontario Bob Rae helped to get &quot;Toronto Islands Residential Community Stewardship Act&quot;, (S.O. 1993, c. 15) legislation passed, which granted Islanders continued deeds to their houses and 99-year leases on the land. A Land Trust was established to handle any transfers or sales of such properties on the Islands.
There are 262 residential properties on Ward&#x27;s Island and Algonquin Island as of late 2018. Under the Act, the deed to a house may be transferred only to the current owner&#x27;s child or spouse. If the house must be sold for personal reasons, and if a child or spouse will not be the new owner, the process is handled by the Toronto Islands Residential Community Trust Corporation. The house and the land lease are sold for the owner&#x27;s benefit, but the buyer must be an individual on a 500-person waiting list which was established through a lottery. A firm price is set by the Trust; no bids or negotiation are allowed. This process was intended to eliminate the risk of the homes being sold on the open market, driving up the prices, and preventing a windfall for the owner.

==Geography==
The area of the Islands is about . The largest, outermost island, called Centre Island, is crescent-shaped and forms the shoreline of both the Eastern and Western Channels. Algonquin Island (formerly known as Sunfish Island) and Olympic Island are two of the other major islands. The former is mostly a residential area and the latter is public parkland. What is commonly called Ward&#x27;s Island is actually the eastern end of Centre Island, and like Algonquin is mostly a residential area. The Centre Island dock and Centreville Amusement Park are located on Middle Island, which as a consequence, is often mistaken for Centre Island. Centre Island is sometimes referred to as Toronto Island (note the singular form) to prevent this type of confusion. Other smaller islands include:
* Mugg&#x27;s Island – home to the Island Yacht Club
* Forestry Island – heavily forested and no fixed link to other islands
* Snake Island – heavily forested and beach facing Toronto Harbour (Snake Island Park); access from the pedestrian bridge on the south side to Centre Island
* North Chippewa Island – partially forested and used by the Royal Canadian Yacht Club to store ships and with a mini clubhouse
* South Chippewa Island – heavily forested and located between Snake Island and South Island
* South Island – used for mooring and on-land storage of boats by the Royal Canadian Yacht Club; east end of the island cut off at Chippewa Avenue and covered by trees; a tennis court is located on west end of the island
* RCYC Island – occupied by Royal Canadian Yacht Club with clubhouse, moorings and other club facilities; private pier for RCYC launches &quot;Kwasind&quot; and &quot;Hiawatha&quot; to the mainland
* Hanlan&#x27;s Island – heavily forested and located in between Centre Island, located in Hanlan&#x27;s Bay, near Lighthouse Pond

Three unnamed islands occupy what was once Block House Bay and Long Pond:
* an island (sometimes called Senator Frank Patrick O&#x27;Connor Island) – located in between Chippewa Island and Snake Island
* a small island (sometimes called Doughnut Island) in Long Pond (the former water intake of the City of Toronto) – located across from Mugg&#x27;s Island
* another small island (sometimes called Duckling Island) in Long Pond (completely covered in shrubbery) – located near Middle Island

The Islands were originally a peninsula or sand spit extending from the mainland. The Islands are composed of alluvial deposits from the erosion of the Scarborough Bluffs. The flow from the Niagara River to the south across Lake Ontario causes a counter-clockwise east-to-west current which has, over time, deposited sediments at the south end of the harbour to form a sand spit.

In 1852, a storm flooded sand pits on the peninsula, creating a channel east of Ward&#x27;s Island. The channel was widened and made permanent by a violent storm on April 13, 1858. The channel became known as the &quot;Eastern Gap&quot;. The peninsula to the west became known as the Toronto Islands. To the east of the Gap, the area of today&#x27;s Cherry Beach was known as &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Island&quot;.

Sediment deposition to the Islands halted in the 1960s when the Leslie Street Spit was extended beyond the southern edge of the islands. Left to nature, the islands would diminish over time, but this is limited due to hard shorelines built to limit erosion. Over the years, land reclamation has contributed to an increase in the size of the islands. The harbour was shallow with a sandy bottom and the sands were moved by dredging or suction methods. Ward&#x27;s Island was expanded by dredging. Today&#x27;s Algonquin Island, formerly known as Sunfish Island, was created from harbour bottom sands.

The area now occupied by the airport has been subject to several landfills over what was once sandy shoal, initially to accommodate the amusement park that preceded the airport, and then to accommodate the airport itself. The Western Channel to the north of the airport is part of the original western channel, which was just south of today&#x27;s Fort York. It was opened in 1911 as part of a program to improve boat navigation into the harbour. The airport lands were created from harbour sands in the late 1930s.

A series of waterways allow boat traffic to navigate the Islands:
* Allan Lamport Regatta Course – located between Centre Island and Middle Island from Long Pond to east end of Far Enough Farm
* Block House Bay – located on the east side of Hanlan&#x27;s Point
* Deep Pike Cut – located on the east side of Mugg&#x27;s Island
* Hanlan&#x27;s Bay – located in between Centre Island and Hanlan&#x27;s Island
* Lighthouse Pond – located next to Gibraltar Point lighthouse
* Long Pond – located between Allan Lamport Regatta Course and Block House Bay; also referred to as Kennedy Pond in the 1890s
* Snake Pond – located between Snug Harbour and Algonquin Island
* Snug Harbour – located between Snake Island and Olympic Island
* Sunfish Cut - located between Snake Island and Algonquin Island
* Trout Pond – located west of Lighthouse Bay on the south end of Hanlan&#x27;s Point

Hanlan&#x27;s Bay was a waterway that has since been buried under the Toronto Island Airport runways.

Jim Crow Pond - filled in by South Island

Ward&#x27;s Pond - located roughly along the south side of Olympic Island and South Island

===Climate===
The Toronto Island has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification system.

The climate differs from the mainland in that cooler lake waters surrounding the island cool spring, summer and early fall daytime temperatures by 2–3 °C, on average. In winter, the unfrozen lake waters are sometimes warmer than the air, temperatures are roughly equivalent to the downtown area but warmer than areas further away from the lake. Fog and low clouds are more frequent at the island than on the mainland. Nearshore areas of the lake only freeze after a consistent period of below-freezing weather.

The highest temperature ever recorded at Toronto Island was on 15 June 1919. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 13 January 1914.

==Culture==
===Community===

A community of about 300 homes is located on the Toronto Islands, concentrated at the eastern end of the island chain on Ward&#x27;s Island and Algonquin Island. Under the terms of the &quot;Toronto Islands Residential Community Stewardship Act&quot; there are strict rules under provincial law governing the buying and selling of these homes.

There are two daycare centres, one school and one church on the islands. The Toronto Island Public School, located at Gibraltar Point, operates a day program for island residents, residents of the Toronto waterfront and other students that can apply for enrollment, up to grade 6. There is also a residential natural science program for visiting grade 5 and 6 students from the mainland, and a pre-school nursery. The Waterfront Montessori Children&#x27;s Centre is a non-profit, parent-run co-operative pre-school on Algonquin Island. St. Andrew by-the-Lake Anglican Church is located on Centre Island, and serves the islands&#x27; residents and visitors. The semi-Gothic/Medieval/Stick Style building was built in 1884 and moved later to its current location.

The Ward&#x27;s Island residential community encompasses of the entire Toronto Island park. There are approximately 150 residences, most of which are occupied on a yearly basis and a centrally located Ward&#x27;s Island Association club house which was built 1937–8. The layout of the streets remains as it has been since 1915 and the streets are named sequentially First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth Streets, as well as Bayview, Willow, Channel, Lenore and Lakeshore Avenues and Withrow Street.

Artscape Gibraltar Point occupies buildings previously used by the Toronto Island Public School, and comprises more than 15 artist work studios occupied by a mix of painters, ceramists, sculptors, musicians, theatre companies, and a recording studio.

===Recreation===

There are several swimming beaches on the Islands, including Centre Island Beach, Manitou Beach, Gibraltar Point Beach, Hanlan&#x27;s Point Beach and Ward&#x27;s Island Beach. Hanlan&#x27;s Point Beach is an officially recognized clothing-optional beach, one of only two in Canada. Ward&#x27;s Island Beach is located on the island east end near the Eastern Gap. Island Beach is located on the south side of the island and faces out to Lake Ontario. The beach is actually two beaches with the portion west of the Lookout Pier called Manitou Beach. The eastern boundary is near the western end of the boardwalk from Ward&#x27;s Island. Hanlan&#x27;s Point Beach is located on the west side of Toronto Islands on Lake Ontario, south of the airport and Hanlan&#x27;s Point ferry dock.

Recreational boating has been popular on the Islands for over a century. In 1965, the Toronto Island Sailing Club was founded on Algonquin Island out of the former Algonquin Island Schoolhouse. In 1970, the club moved to the northwest peninsula of Centre Island in the newly opened Toronto Island Marina. The club offers its members certified CANSail courses and competitive racing events with other dinghy clubs, and is also a member in good standing with Sail Canada, Ontario Sailing and the Canadian Albacore Association.

The Islands are home to four yacht clubs: Harbour City Yacht Club, Island Yacht Club, Queen City Yacht Club and the Royal Canadian Yacht Club. There is a public marina, the Toronto Island Marina, and several smaller clubs including the Sunfish Cut Boat Club and the Toronto Island Canoe Club. There is also a dragon boat regatta course and grandstand, where the Toronto International Dragon Boat Race Festival is held annually. Canoes, kayaks, paddle boats and stand up paddle boards are available for rental.

Centreville Amusement Park is a children&#x27;s amusement park which was built in 1967 with a 1900s-style turn-of-the-century theme. The park includes a miniature railway and an antique carousel and is open daily in summer. The &quot;Far Enough Farm&quot; is nearby and displays common farm livestock and birds. The &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Garden&quot; children&#x27;s garden was created in the 2000s and is located to the west of the Avenue of the Islands. A splash pad, hedge maze, and playground are also located nearby.

On the western side of Ward&#x27;s Island is a flying disc golf course. There are public tennis courts located at Hanlan&#x27;s Point and a community tennis club at the Ward&#x27;s Island Tennis Club.

Until 2007, Caribana held an annual arts festival at Olympic Island on the August long weekend. Other Island events include the Olympic Island Festival, an annual rock concert held from 2004 until 2010. It was initiated in 2004 by Sloan&#x27;s Jay Ferguson. The Wakestock festival has also been held on the islands. Starting in 1975, the Canadian Open Frisbee Championships were held on Olympic and Ward&#x27;s Island.

==Education==

The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is an English first language secular public school board that serves the City of Toronto, including the Toronto Islands. Currently the school board operates one elementary school on the Islands, Island Public/Natural Science School on Centre Island. the school has 179 students. 15% of the student population originates from Algonquin and Ward islands and about 85% of the students live in the city and take ferry transportation to school.

Other TDSB schools attended by students that live on the Island include The Waterfront School, Jarvis Collegiate Institute, Central Technical School, Central Commerce Collegiate Institute, and Northern Secondary School. However, these schools are located on the mainland.

In addition to the TDSB, three other public school boards also provide schooling for residents of Toronto Islands, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM), Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB). CSV is a public French first language secular school board. CSCM, and TCDSB are public separate school boards, the former being a French first language school board, the latter being an English first language school board.

==Politics==
The islands are within the Spadina—Fort York federal riding, the Spadina—Fort York provincial riding and the Spadina–Fort York Ward 10 municipal district. The islands are represented federally by Independent MP Kevin Vuong, provincially by NDP MPP Chris Glover, and municipally by councillor Ausma Malik.

The islands were part of the federal riding of Trinity—Spadina from 2004 until 2015. From 1997 to 2004 the area was part of Toronto Centre—Rosedale, from 1966 to 1997 it was part of Rosedale, from 1933 to 1966 it was part of Spadina and from 1903 to 1933 it was part of Toronto South.

The islands were in the provincial riding of Trinity—Spadina from 2007 until 2018. From 1999 to 2007 the area was part of Toronto Centre—Rosedale, and from 1987 to 1999 it was part of Fort York.

==Transportation==
===Airport===

The north-western tip of the Toronto Islands is home to the Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, more often known as the Toronto Island Airport. The airport is used for civil aviation, including airlines, flight training, medevac flights and private aviation. Since 1984, it has been used for regional airlines using approved STOL-type aircraft. In recent years, the airport has become the centre of controversy between those who wish to close it down, and those who want to expand its usage. A plan to construct a road bridge to the airport became a major issue in the 2003 election for mayor, and was cancelled after David Miller was elected. A pedestrian tunnel to the airport was opened in July 2015, but does not connect to the rest of the island park. A proposal to allow jets at the airport was turned down by the Government of Canada.

===Ferry services===
There is no fixed road link from the mainland to the Toronto Islands, which therefore rely on ferries, water taxis and other boats for their transport needs.

Three public ferry routes provide links for visitors, island residents, and service vehicles from the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal on the central Toronto waterfront to docks at Hanlan&#x27;s Point, Centre Island Park, and Ward&#x27;s Island. The only year-round ferry service is to and from Ward&#x27;s Island. A fourth public ferry service provides a vehicle and passenger connection from a dock at the foot of Bathurst Street to the airport. There is no public access between the airport and the rest of the island chain.

In addition to the public ferry services, several yacht clubs and marinas located on the islands provide private-tender services for their members and guests. In June 2017, Centreville purchased a used ferry boat, the Dartmouth III, from Halifax Transit in Nova Scotia and planned to operate its own service, Toronto Island Transit Service, to supplement the public ferry. The ferry arrived in Toronto but due to flooding and the pandemic, it was never used to bring passengers across the harbour.

===Roads===

Roads on the islands are paved, the only exception being a long wooden boardwalk on the south end of Ward&#x27;s Island. The use of motor vehicles is limited to City of Toronto government service vehicles (Parks and Recreation, paramedics etc.), an exception being parking and roadways at the airport. Bicycles are welcome on the ferries and the island, and there are rental bicycles and quadricyles available on the island. Lakeshore Avenue is the main road handling vehicular traffic. The single-lane paved road traverses the east, south and west sides of the park. The six bridges on the island are for pedestrian traffic, bicycles and all-terrain vehicles only. The bridge carrying traffic from Avenue of the Islands can support large vehicles, but not cars or heavy trucks. Other bridges include:

* two bridges connecting Centre Island with Olympic Island
* bridge along Chippewa Avenue to South Island
* bridge over to Snake Island
* Algonquin Road Bridge to Algonquin Island

The Island Bus runs during Toronto Island Ferry downtime, when ferries cannot operate due to high winds, unfavourable weather conditions, a frozen harbour, or maintenance, on a very occasional basis usually during the winter months. When in use, visitors may cross at Island Airport via tunnel or ferry and take the bus from outside the main terminal. Because the bus crosses live airport runways, each crossing has to be accompanied by an escort. Two Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) GM TC40-102N buses provided service to the Toronto Parks Department for use on the Island during the 1970s. Since they were withdrawn it has become usual for TTC to assign to the Island a bus from a series that is coming to the end of its service life. A GM New Look operated on the Island until Spring 2012 after its regular service ended. Orion V #7106 was based on the Toronto Islands until it was replaced by Orion VII OG #7953.

There are fewer restrictions on motor vehicles on the airport lands, with a vehicular ferry providing access to parking lots and service access at the airport, however there is no public road access from the airport lands to the rest of the islands.

==In popular culture==
The Toronto Islands have appeared as significant settings in Canadian literature. Examples include Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Robber Bride&quot; and Robert Rotenberg&#x27;s &quot;Old City Hall&quot;.

The novel &quot;Heyday&quot;, by Marnie Woodrow, has two narratives, one set on Ward&#x27;s Island in the present day, and the other set on Hanlan&#x27;s in 1909.

Claudia Dey&#x27;s novel &quot;Stunt&quot; is also set on Ward&#x27;s Island.

In &quot;Take This Waltz&quot;, a 2011 film by Canadian director Sarah Polley, the main character Margot (Michelle Williams) rides the Scrambler at the Centreville Amusement Park.

The second season of &quot;Sensitive Skin&quot; is set predominantly on the islands when the main character, Davina moves to a houseboat located on the islands.

Canadian singer-songwriter Jordan Paul composed his song Ward&#x27;s Island, inspired by and during a visit to the island. The song was subsequently recorded with Jon Anderson, producer of Aidan Knight and Said The Whale.

In the 2013 film &quot;The F Word&quot;, characters Allan and Nicole get married on the Island.

<doc id="178934" wikidata="Q1020010" url="?curid=178934" title="Florø">
<text>is a town and the administrative centre of the municipality of Kinn which is in Vestland county, Norway. The town was founded by royal decree in 1860 as a ladested on the island of Florelandet, located between the Botnafjorden and Solheimsfjorden. Florø is Norway&#x27;s (and thus the Scandinavian Peninsula&#x27;s) westernmost town. It is the most western town on the mainland in the Nordic countries.

The town has a population (2018) of 9,024 and a population density of .

The town encompasses the entire island of Florelandet and the western half of the island of Brandsøya. The Norwegian national road Rv 5 is the main road connecting Florø to the rest of Norway. The nearby villages of Brandsøy and Grov lie several kilometers to the east of Florø. The islands of Reksta, Kinn, Skorpa lie several kilometers to the west of the town. Florø is also home to Florø Airport and Florø Church.

Florø is also a former municipality that existed as an independent town-municipality for just over 100 years (1860-1964) before being merged into the municipality of Flora. On 1 January 2020, the town became part of the new Kinn Municipality after another municipal merger.

==Name==
The town (and municipality) was named after the old &quot;Flora&quot; farm (), near where the town of Florø was built in 1860. The meaning of the name is somewhat uncertain with a couple of different likely possibilities. The old name, is the accusative case/genitive case of the word which means &quot;floor&quot;, from which the names &quot;Flora&quot; and &quot;Florelandet&quot; are derived. This Old Norse word is probably derived from a Germanic root word, , meaning &quot;flat ground&quot;. Another possibility for the meaning of the name is that it is derived from the word which means &quot;flood&quot; or &quot;deluge&quot;. A common misunderstanding is that the name &quot;Florø&quot; includes the Danish word which means &quot;island&quot; as a suffix that was attached to the farm name &quot;Flora&quot;. Although not true, it nearly led to the town being renamed &quot;Florøy&quot; in the 1930s.

==Economy==
The basis for the foundation of the town was the rich herring fisheries, symbolised by the three herrings in the town&#x27;s coat of arms. Fishing is still an important part of the economy, in addition to shipbuilding and service industries. After the discovery of petroleum in the North Sea in the 1960s, Florø has been used as a supply base for the petroleum industry.

==History==

Florø was founded as a town &quot;(ladested)&quot; in 1860. Shortly after its founding, on 3 January 1861, it was removed from the (now) former municipality of Kinn and made into a municipality of its own with a population of 846. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, a large municipal merger took place, merging the following places to form the newly created municipality of Flora.
*the town-municipality of Florø (population: 2,040) 
*the municipality of Eikefjord (population: 919)
*the municipality of Kinn (population: 3,567)
*the parts of the municipality of Bru located north of the Førde Fjord (population: 1,155)
*the Husefest and Breivik areas of the municipality of Bremanger (population: 9)
*the Steindal area of the municipality of Vevring (population: 25)

On 1 January 2020, Flora was one of the municipalities that merged into a newly re-created Kinn municipality, much larger than the Kinn that existed until 1964.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms for the town of Florø was granted on 19 February 1960 and they were in use until 1 January 1964, when the new Flora Municipality was created and it included the town of Florø. (On 6 October 1967, the old arms of Florø were granted as the arms for Flora Municipality. These arms were in use until 1 January 2020 when the municipality of Flora was dissolved.) The official blazon is &quot;Gules, three herrings bendwise argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is a set of three diagonal herring. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The three herrings are a symbol for the great local importance of herring fishing for the development and economy of Flora. The arms were designed by Hallvard Trætteberg. The municipal flag had the same design as the coat of arms.

===Self-government (1861-1964)===
During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

<doc id="178937" wikidata="Q15115271" url="?curid=178937" title="High frequency">
<text>High frequency (HF) is the ITU designation for the band of radio waves with frequency between 3 and 30 megahertz (MHz). It is also known as the decameter band or decameter wave as its wavelengths range from one to ten decameters (ten to one hundred meters). Frequencies immediately below HF are denoted &quot;medium frequency&quot; (MF), while the next band of higher frequencies is known as the &quot;very high frequency&quot; (VHF) band. The HF band is a major part of the shortwave band of frequencies, so communication at these frequencies is often called &quot;shortwave radio&quot;. Because radio waves in this band can be reflected back to Earth by the ionosphere layer in the atmosphere – a method known as &quot;skip&quot; or &quot;skywave&quot; propagation – these frequencies can be used for long-distance communication across intercontinental distances and for mountainous terrains which prevent line-of-sight communications. The band is used by international shortwave broadcasting stations (3.95–25.82 MHz), aviation communication, government time stations, weather stations, amateur radio and citizens band services, among other uses.

==Propagation characteristics==
The dominant means of long-distance communication in this band is skywave (&quot;skip&quot;) propagation, in which radio waves directed at an angle into the sky refract back to Earth from layers of ionized atoms in the ionosphere. By this method HF radio waves can travel beyond the horizon, around the curve of the Earth, and can be received at intercontinental distances. However, suitability of this portion of the spectrum for such communication varies greatly with a complex combination of factors:
*Sunlight/darkness at site of transmission and reception
*Transmitter/receiver proximity to solar terminator
*Season
*Sunspot cycle
*Solar activity
*Polar aurora
At any point in time, for a given &quot;skip&quot; communication path between two points, the frequencies at which communication is possible are specified by these parameters:
*Maximum usable frequency (MUF)
*Lowest usable high frequency (LUF) and a
*Frequency of optimum transmission (FOT)
The maximum usable frequency regularly drops below 10 MHz in darkness during the winter months, while in summer during daylight it can easily surpass 30 MHz. It depends on the angle of incidence of the waves; it is lowest when the waves are directed straight upwards, and is higher with less acute angles. This means that at longer distances, where the waves graze the ionosphere at a very blunt angle, the MUF may be much higher. The lowest usable frequency depends on the absorption in the lower layer of the ionosphere (the D-layer). This absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity (for example in daylight); total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 MHz during the daytime. The result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the Medium Frequency (MF) range during winter nights, while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies tend to be more usable, often into the lower VHF range.

When all factors are at their optimum, worldwide communication is possible on HF. At many other times it is possible to make contact across and between continents or oceans. At worst, when a band is &quot;dead&quot;, no communication beyond the limited groundwave paths is possible no matter what powers, antennas or other technologies are brought to bear. When a transcontinental or worldwide path is open on a particular frequency, , SSB and Morse code communication is possible using surprisingly low transmission powers, often of the order of milliwatts, provided suitable antennas are in use at both ends and that there is little or no artificial or natural interference. On such an open band, interference originating over a wide area affects many potential users. These issues are significant to military, safety and amateur radio users of the HF bands.

There is some propagation by ground waves, the main propagation mode in the lower bands, but transmission distance decreases with frequency due to greater absorption in the earth. At the top end of the band ground wave transmission distances are limited to 10-20 miles. Short range communication can occur by a combination of line-of-sight (LOC), ground bounce, and ground wave paths, but multipath interference can cause fading.

==Uses==


The main uses of the high frequency spectrum are:
* Military and governmental communication systems
* Aviation air-to-ground communications
* Amateur radio
* Shortwave international and regional broadcasting
* Maritime sea-to-shore and ship-to-ship services
* Over-the-horizon radar systems
* Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) communication
* Citizen&#x27;s Band Radio services worldwide (generally 26-28 MHz, the higher portion of the HF band, that behaves more like low-VHF)
* Coastal ocean dynamics applications radar

The high frequency band is very popular with amateur radio operators, who can take advantage of direct, long-distance (often inter-continental) communications and the &quot;thrill factor&quot; resulting from making contacts in variable conditions. International shortwave broadcasting utilizes this set of frequencies, as well as a seemingly declining number of &quot;utility&quot; users (marine, aviation, military, and diplomatic interests), who have, in recent years, been swayed over to less volatile means of communication (for example, via satellites), but may maintain HF stations after switch-over for back-up purposes.

However, the development of Automatic Link Establishment technology based on MIL-STD-188-141 for automated connectivity and frequency selection, along with the high costs of satellite usage, have led to a renaissance in HF usage in government networks. The development of higher speed modems such as those conforming to MIL-STD-188-110C which support data rates up to 120 kilobit/s has also increased the usability of HF for data communications and video transmission. Other standards development such as STANAG 5066 provides for error free data communications through the use of ARQ protocols.

Some modes of communication, such as continuous wave Morse code transmissions (especially by amateur radio operators) and single sideband voice transmissions are more common in the HF range than on other frequencies, because of their bandwidth-conserving nature, but broadband modes, such as TV transmissions, are generally prohibited by HF&#x27;s relatively small chunk of electromagnetic spectrum space.

Noise, especially man-made interference from electronic devices, tends to have a great effect on the HF bands. In recent years, concerns have risen among certain users of the HF spectrum over &quot;broadband over power lines&quot; (BPL) Internet access, which has an almost destructive effect on HF communications. This is due to the frequencies on which BPL operates (typically corresponding with the HF band) and the tendency for the BPL signal to leak from power lines. Some BPL providers have installed notch filters to block out certain portions of the spectrum (namely the amateur radio bands), but a great amount of controversy over the deployment of this access method remains. Other electronic devices including plasma televisions can also have a detrimental effect on the HF spectrum.

In aviation, HF communication systems are required for all trans-oceanic flights. These systems incorporate frequencies down to 2 MHz to include the 2182 kHz international distress and calling channel.

The upper section of HF (26.5-30 MHz) shares many characteristics with the lower part of VHF. The parts of this section not allocated to amateur radio are used for local communications. These include CB radios around 27 MHz, studio-to-transmitter (STL) radio links, radio control devices for models and radio paging transmitters. 
Some radio frequency identification (RFID) tags utilize HF. These tags are commonly known as HFID&#x27;s or HighFID&#x27;s (High-Frequency Identification).

==Antennas==
The most common antennas in this band are wire antennas such as wire dipoles or rhombic antennas; in the upper frequencies, multielement dipole antennas such as the Yagi, quad, and log-periodic antennas. Powerful shortwave broadcasting stations often use large wire curtain arrays.

Antennas for transmitting skywaves are typically made from horizontal dipoles or bottom-fed loops, both of which emit horizontally polarized waves. The preference for horizontally polarized transmission is because (approximately) only half of the signal power transmitted by an antenna travels directly into the sky; about half travels downward towards the ground and must &quot;bounce&quot; into the sky. For frequencies in the upper HF band, the ground is a better reflector of horizontally polarized waves, and better absorber of power from vertically polarized waves. The effect diminishes for longer wavelengths.

For receiving, random wire antennas are often used. Alternatively, the same directional antennas used for transmitting are helpful for receiving, since most noise comes from all directions, but the desired signal comes from only one direction. Long-distance (skywave) receiving antennas can generally be oriented either vertically or horizontally since refraction through the ionosphere usually scrambles signal polarization, and signals are received directly from the sky to the antenna.

The antenna should have a wide enough bandwidth to cover the desired frequency range. Broadband antennas can operate over a wider range of frequencies, while narrowband antennas are more efficient at specific frequencies.

To improve the transmit and receive sensitivity of an HF antenna, the more metal parts are exposed to the air, this helps to increase the receive sensitivity. However, in places with a lot of radio signal noise, such as urban areas, the surrounding noise signals are also heard, so the design method is applied by using a directional High frequency(HF) Radio Antenna, or using an HF antenna in a remote area with a low HF Noise Floor level and connecting the HF transceiver.

<doc id="178942" wikidata="Q203209" url="?curid=178942" title="Conceptual art">
<text>Conceptual art, also referred to as conceptualism, is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work are prioritized equally to or more than traditional aesthetic, technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions. This method was fundamental to American artist Sol LeWitt&#x27;s definition of conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

Tony Godfrey, author of &quot;Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)&quot; (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art, a notion that Joseph Kosuth elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, &quot;Art after Philosophy&quot; (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic Clement Greenberg&#x27;s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as Art &amp; Language, Joseph Kosuth (who became the American editor of Art-Language), and Lawrence Weiner began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see below). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of material objects.
Through its association with the Young British Artists and the Turner Prize during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the United Kingdom, &quot;conceptual art&quot; came to denote all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture. One of the reasons why the term &quot;conceptual art&quot; has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist Mel Bochner suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet &quot;conceptual&quot;, it is not always entirely clear what &quot;concept&quot; refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with &quot;intention&quot;. Thus, in describing or defining a work of art as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as &quot;conceptual&quot; with an artist&#x27;s &quot;intention&quot;.

==Precursors==
The French artist Marcel Duchamp paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the readymades, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp&#x27;s readymades was &quot;Fountain&quot; (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym &quot;R.Mutt&quot;, and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it). The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp&#x27;s relevance and theoretical importance for future &quot;conceptualists&quot; was later acknowledged by US artist Joseph Kosuth in his 1969 essay, &quot;Art after Philosophy&quot;, when he wrote: &quot;All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually&quot;.

In 1956 the founder of Lettrism, Isidore Isou, developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called &quot;Art esthapériste&quot; (or &quot;infinite-aesthetics&quot;), derived from the infinitesimals of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation () of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

==Origins==
In 1961, philosopher and artist Henry Flynt coined the term &quot;concept art&quot; in an article bearing the same name which appeared in the proto-Fluxus publication &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot;. Flynt&#x27;s concept art, he maintained, devolved from his notion of &quot;cognitive nihilism&quot;, in which paradoxes in logic are shown to evacuate concepts of substance. Drawing on the syntax of logic and mathematics, concept art was meant jointly to supersede mathematics and the formalistic music then current in serious art music circles. Therefore, Flynt maintained, to merit the label &quot;concept art&quot;, a work had to be a critique of logic or mathematics in which a linguistic concept was the material, a quality which is absent from subsequent &quot;conceptual art&quot;.

The term assumed a different meaning when employed by Joseph Kosuth and by the English Art and Language group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in &quot;Art-Language: The Journal of Conceptual Art&quot; in 1969, into the artist&#x27;s social, philosophical, and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 &quot;Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects&quot;, the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the New York Cultural Center.

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against formalism as then articulated by the influential New York art critic Clement Greenberg. According to Greenberg Modern art followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, formal nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as figuration, 3-D perspective illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this &quot;dematerialization&quot; of art by removing the need for objects altogether,
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg&#x27;s kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg&#x27;s stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.
Conceptual art also reacted against the commodification of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. Lawrence Weiner said: &quot;Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There&#x27;s no way I can climb inside somebody&#x27;s head and remove it.&quot; Many conceptual artists&#x27; work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g., photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in and of themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of Robert Barry, Yoko Ono, and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the &quot;art&quot; side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and craft, where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono&#x27;s &quot;written instructions&quot; make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists Lawrence Weiner, Edward Ruscha, Joseph Kosuth, Robert Barry, and Art &amp; Language begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching composition (e.g. Synthetic Cubism), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right. Of Lawrence Weiner&#x27;s works Anne Rorimer writes, &quot;The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles.&quot;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art Peter Osborne suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American analytic philosophy, and structuralist and post structuralist Continental philosophy during the middle of the twentieth century. This linguistic turn &quot;reinforced and legitimized&quot; the direction the conceptual artists took. Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art. Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is &quot;post-conceptual&quot; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in Como on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the ontology of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian Edward A. Shanken points to the example of Roy Ascott who &quot;powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories.&quot; Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with cybernetic art in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of cybernetics was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, &quot;The Construction of Change&quot; (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol LeWitt) of Lucy R. Lippard&#x27;s seminal &quot;Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972&quot;, Ascott&#x27;s anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott&#x27;s use of the thesaurus in 1963 telematic connections:: timeline, which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept that would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth&#x27;s &quot;Second Investigation, Proposition 1&quot; (1968) and Mel Ramsden&#x27;s &quot;Elements of an Incomplete Map&quot; (1968).

==Contemporary history==
Proto-conceptualism has roots in the rise of Modernism with, for example, Manet (1832–1883) and later Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968). The first wave of the &quot;conceptual art&quot; movement extended from approximately 1967
to 1978. Early &quot;concept&quot; artists like Henry Flynt (1940– ), Robert Morris (1931–2018), and Ray Johnson (1927–1995) influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like Dan Graham, Hans Haacke, and Lawrence Weiner have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well-known contemporary artists such as Mike Kelley or Tracey Emin are sometimes labeled &quot;second- or third-generation&quot; conceptualists, or &quot;post-conceptual&quot; artists (the prefix Post- in art can frequently be interpreted as &quot;because of&quot;).

Contemporary artists have taken up many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement, while they may or may not term themselves &quot;conceptual artists&quot;. Ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with installation art, performance art, art intervention, net.art, and electronic/digital art.

===Revival===
Neo-conceptual art describes art practices in the 1980s and particularly 1990s to date that derive from the conceptual art movement of the 1960s and 1970s. These subsequent initiatives have included the Moscow Conceptualists, United States neo-conceptualists such as Sherrie Levine and the Young British Artists, notably Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin in the United Kingdom.

==Notable examples==
* 1913 : &quot;Bicycle Wheel&quot; &quot;(Roue de bicyclette)&quot; by Marcel Duchamp. Assisted readymade. Bicycle wheel mounted by its fork on a painted wooden stool. The first readymade, even though he did not have the idea for readymades until two years later. The original was lost. Also, recognized as the first kinetic sculpture. 
* 1914 : &quot;Bottle Rack&quot; (also called &quot;Bottle Dryer&quot; or &quot;Hedgehog&quot;) (&quot;Egouttoir&quot; or &quot;Porte-bouteilles&quot; or &quot;Hérisson&quot;) by Marcel Duchamp. Readymade. A galvanized iron bottle drying rack that Duchamp bought as an &quot;already made&quot; sculpture, but it gathered dust in the corner of his Paris studio. Two years later in 1916, in correspondence from New York with his sister, Suzanne Duchamp in France, he expresses a desire to make it a readymade. Suzanne, looking after his Paris studio, has already disposed of it.
* 1915 : &quot;In Advance of the Broken Arm&quot; &quot;(En prévision du bras cassé)&quot; by Marcel Duchamp. Readymade. Snow shovel on which Duchamp carefully painted its title. The first piece the artist officially called a &quot;readymade&quot;.
* 1916–17 : &quot;Apolinère Enameled&quot;, 1916–1917. Rectified readymade. An altered Sapolin paint advertisement.
* 1917 : &quot;Fountain&quot; by Marcel Duchamp, described in an article in &quot;The Independent&quot; as the invention of conceptual art. It is also an early example of an Institutional Critique
* 1917 : &quot;Hat Rack&quot; &quot;(Porte-chapeaux)&quot;, , by Marcel Duchamp. Readymade. A wooden hatrack.
* 1919 : &quot;L.H.O.O.Q.&quot; by Marcel Duchamp. Rectified readymade. Pencil on a reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; on which he drew a goatee and moustache titled with a coarse pun.
* 1921 : &quot;Why Not Sneeze, Rose Sélavy?&quot; by Marcel Duchamp. Assisted readymade. Marble cubes in the shape of sugar lumps with a thermometer and cuttle bones in a small bird cage.
* 1921 : &quot;Belle Haleine, Eau de Voilette&quot; by Marcel Duchamp. Assisted readymade. An altered perfume bottle in the original box.
* 1952 : The premiere of American experimental composer John Cage&#x27;s work, &quot;4′33″,&quot; a three-movement composition, performed by pianist David Tudor on August 29, 1952, in Maverick Concert Hall, Woodstock, New York, as part of a recital of contemporary piano music. It is commonly perceived as &quot;four minutes thirty-three seconds of silence&quot;.
* 1953 : Robert Rauschenberg produces &quot;Erased De Kooning Drawing&quot;, a drawing by Willem de Kooning which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist&#x27;s work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only &quot;art&quot; because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series &quot;pièces de complices&quot;, combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.
* 1958: George Brecht invents the &quot;Event Score&quot; which would become a central feature of Fluxus. Brecht, Dick Higgins, Allan Kaprow, Al Hansen, Jackson MacLow and others studied with John Cage between 1958 and 1959 at the New School leading directly to the creation of Happenings, Fluxus and Henry Flynt&#x27;s concept art. &quot;Event Scores&quot; are simple instructions to complete everyday tasks which can be performed publicly, privately, or not at all.
* 1958: Wolf Vostell &quot;Das Theater ist auf der Straße&quot;/&quot;The theater is on the street&quot;. The first Happening in Europe.
* 1961: Piero Manzoni exhibited &quot;Artist&#x27;s Shit&quot;, tins purportedly containing his own feces (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as &quot;Bodies of Air&quot;, and signed people&#x27;s bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). Marcel Broodthaers and Primo Levi are amongst the designated &quot;artworks&quot;.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as Billy Apple, erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.
* 1962: Yves Klein presents &quot;Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity&quot; in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own &quot;pictorial sensitivity&quot; (whatever that was – he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein&#x27;s sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in Wiesbaden with George Maciunas, Wolf Vostell, Nam June Paik and others.
* 1963: George Brecht&#x27;s collection of Event-Scores, &quot;Water Yam&quot;, is published as the first &quot;Fluxkit&quot; by George Maciunas.
* 1964: Yoko Ono publishes &quot;Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings&quot;, an example of heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: Art &amp; Language founder Michael Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Mirror Piece&quot;. Instead of paintings, the work shows a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and Clement Greenberg&#x27;s theory.
* Joseph Kosuth dates the concept of &quot;One and Three Chairs&quot; to the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo, and an enlargement of a definition of the word &quot;chair&quot;. Kosuth chose the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 &quot;The Air Conditioning Show&quot; of Art &amp; Language is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of &quot;Arts Magazine&quot;.
* 1967: Mel Ramsden&#x27;s first &quot;100% Abstract Paintings&quot;. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitutes the substance of the painting.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge and Harold Hurrell found Art &amp; Language.
* 1968: Lawrence Weiner relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his &quot;Declaration of Intent&quot;, one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt&#x27;s &quot;Paragraphs on Conceptual Art&quot;. The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice, reads: &quot;1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.&quot;
* 1969: The first generation of New York alternative exhibition spaces are established, including Billy Apple&#x27;s APPLE, Robert Newman&#x27;s Gain Ground, where Vito Acconci produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.
* 1973: Jacek Tylicki begins to lay out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for nature to create art.
* 1973-1979: Mary Kelly makes her &quot;Post-Partum Document&quot;, composed of six separate parts charting the first six years of caring for her son. Through a psychoanalytical and feminist lens, the work explores the mother-child relationship and examines her son&#x27;s evolving sense of self as well as her own.
* 1982: The &quot;opera Victorine&quot; by Art &amp; Language was to be performed in the city of Kassel for documenta 7 and shown alongside Art &amp; Language &quot;Studio at 3 Wesley Place Painted by Actors&quot;, but the performance was cancelled.
* 1990: Ashley Bickerton and Ronald Jones included in &quot;Mind Over Matter: Concept and Object&quot; exhibition of &quot;third generation Conceptual artists&quot; at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
* 1991: Ronald Jones exhibits objects and text, art, history and science rooted in grim political reality at Metro Pictures Gallery.
* 1991: Charles Saatchi funds Damien Hirst and the next year in the Saatchi Gallery exhibits his &quot;The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living&quot;, a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine.
* 1992: Maurizio Bolognini starts to &quot;seal&quot; his Programmed Machines: hundreds of computers are programmed and left to run ad infinitum to generate inexhaustible flows of random images which nobody would see.
* 1999: Tracey Emin is nominated for the Turner Prize. Part of her exhibit is &quot;My Bed&quot;, her dishevelled bed, surrounded by detritus such as condoms, blood-stained knickers, bottles and her bedroom slippers.
* 2001: Martin Creed wins the Turner Prize for &quot;Work No. 227: The lights going on and off&quot;, an empty room in which the lights go on and off.
* 2003: damali ayo exhibits at the Center of Contemporary Art, Seattle, WA &quot;Flesh Tone #1: Skinned&quot;, a collaborative self-portrait where she asked paint mixers from local hardware stores to create house paint to match various parts of her body, while recording the interactions.
* 2005: Simon Starling wins the Turner Prize for &quot;Shedboatshed&quot;, a wooden shed which he had turned into a boat, floated down the Rhine and turned back into a shed again.
* 2014: Olaf Nicolai creates the &quot;Memorial for the Victims of Nazi Military Justice&quot; on Vienna&#x27;s Ballhausplatz after winning an international competition. The inscription on top of the three-step sculpture features a poem by Scottish poet Ian Hamilton Finlay (1924–2006) with just two words: &quot;all alone&quot;.
* 2019: Maurizio Cattelan sells two editions of &quot;Comedian&quot;, which appears as a banana duct taped to a wall, for US$120,000 each, garnering significant media attention.

<text>Tripe is a type of edible lining from the stomachs of various farm animals. Most tripe is from cattle and sheep.

== Types ==

===Beef===

Beef tripe is made from the muscle wall (the interior mucosal lining is removed) of a cow&#x27;s stomach chambers: the rumen (blanket/flat/smooth tripe), the reticulum (honeycomb and pocket tripe), and the omasum (book/bible/leaf tripe). Abomasum (reed) tripe is seen less frequently, owing to its glandular tissue content.

===Other animals===
Tripe refers to cow (beef) stomach, but includes stomach of any ruminant including cattle, sheep, deer, antelope, goat, ox, giraffes, and their relatives. , the related Spanish word, refers to culinary dishes produced from the small intestines of an animal. In some cases, other names have been applied to the tripe of other animals. For example, tripe from pigs may be referred to as &quot;paunch&quot;, &quot;pig bag&quot;, or &quot;hog maw&quot;.

===Washed tripe===
Washed tripe is more typically known as dressed tripe. To dress the tripe, the stomachs are cleaned and the fat trimmed off. It is then boiled and bleached, giving it the white color more commonly associated with tripe as seen on market stalls and in butchers&#x27; shops. The task of dressing the tripe is usually carried out by a professional tripe dresser.

Dressed tripe was a popular, nutritious and cheap dish for the British working classes from Victorian times until the latter half of the 20th century. While it is still popular in many parts of the world today, the number of tripe eaters, and consequently the number of tripe dressers, in the UK has rapidly declined. Tripe has come to be regarded as a pet food, as the increased affluence of postwar Britain has reduced the appeal of this once staple food.

It remains a popular dish in many parts of continental Europe such as Portugal, Spain, France and Italy. In France, a very popular dish, sold in most supermarkets, is &quot;tripes à la mode de Caen&quot;. In Spain are served as tapas in many restaurants as well as in supermarkets. The most beloved and celebrated dish in the city of Porto and surrounding areas, in Portugal, is &#x27;tripas à moda do Porto&#x27;, a tripe stew made with white butter beans, carrots, paprika and chouriço. It is so loved that locals are called &#x27;Tripeiros&#x27;, in an homage to the &#x27;tripa&#x27; (tripe).

<text>Pepperoni is a variety of spicy salami made from cured pork and beef seasoned with paprika and chili peppers.

Before cooking, pepperoni is characteristically soft, slightly smoky, and bright red. Sliced pepperoni is one of the most popular pizza toppings in American pizzerias.

Traditionally made pepperonis curl into &quot;cups&quot; in the pizza oven&#x27;s intense heat; commercialization of the production of pepperoni created slices that would lie flat on the pizza. The curled &quot;cup and char&quot; style of pepperoni remained popular in pockets of the Midwest.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;pepperoni&quot; is a borrowing of &quot;peperoni&quot;, the plural of &quot;peperone&quot;, the Italian word for bell pepper. The first use of &quot;pepperoni&quot; to refer to a sausage dates to 1916 at the latest. In Italian, the word &quot;peperoncino&quot; refers to chili peppers.

==History==
In 1919, Italian immigrants in New York City created pepperoni. It is a cured dry sausage, with similarities to the spicy salamis of southern Italy on which it is based, such as &quot;salsiccia&quot; or &quot;soppressata&quot;. The main differences are that pepperoni is less spicy, has a finer grain (akin to spiceless salami from Milan), is usually softer in texture, and is usually produced with the use of an artificial casing.

==Production==

Pepperoni is made from pork or from a mixture of pork and beef. Turkey meat is also commonly used as a substitute, but the use of poultry in pepperoni must be appropriately labeled in the United States. It is typically seasoned with paprika or other chili pepper.

Prior to cooking, pepperoni is characteristically soft, slightly smoky, and bright red. Curing with nitrates or nitrites (usually used in modern curing agents to protect against botulism and other forms of microbiological decay) also contributes to pepperoni&#x27;s reddish color, by reacting with heme in the myoglobin of the proteinaceous components of the meat.

==Serving==

Sliced pepperoni is one of the most popular pizza toppings in American pizzerias. According to &quot;Convenience Store Decisions&quot;, in 2009 Americans consumed of pepperoni annually, on 36% of all pizzas produced nationally.

Pepperoni is also used as the filling of the pepperoni roll, a popular regional snack in West Virginia and neighboring areas.

In the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, deep fried pepperoni served on its own (usually with a honey mustard dipping sauce) is common pub food.

== Cup and char ==
Pepperoni has a tendency to curl up from the edges in the heat of a pizza oven; historically all pepperonis showed at least some of this tendency to curl in the oven because of their natural casings.

As commercial suppliers became the main suppliers to pizza shops, they developed a fibrous synthetic casing which is intended to be stripped from the pepperoni before it is sliced. This resulted in a pepperoni that does not curl. An additional benefit of non-curling pepperoni is that it eliminates the small deposits of hot grease that formed in the cupped pepperoni, therefore also eliminating any possible liability for customers who burn themselves on it. 

The original style became known as &quot;cup and char&quot; pepperoni and remains popular in parts of the Midwest and Great Lakes areas, particularly around Cleveland, Ohio, and Buffalo, New York, and regained popularity in other areas in the 2010s. It is more expensive to produce.

<doc id="178945" wikidata="Q366700" url="?curid=178945" title="Klaus Voormann">
<text>Klaus Otto Wilhelm Voormann (born 29 April 1938) is a German artist, musician, and record producer.

Voormann was the bassist for Manfred Mann from 1966 to 1969, and performed as a session musician on a host of recordings, including &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; by Carly Simon, Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Transformer&quot; album, and on many recordings of the former members of the Beatles. As a producer, Voormann worked with the band Trio on their worldwide hit &quot;Da Da Da&quot;.

Voormann&#x27;s association with the Beatles dates back to their time in Hamburg in the early 1960s. He lived in the band&#x27;s London flat with George Harrison and Ringo Starr after John Lennon and Paul McCartney moved out to live with their respective partners. He designed the cover of their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;, for which he won a Grammy Award. He also designed the graphics for the sheet music of songs from &quot;Revolver&quot;. Following the band&#x27;s split, rumors circulated of the formation of a group named the Ladders, consisting of Lennon, Harrison, Starr and Voormann. This failed to materialise; however, all four would-be Ladders (plus Billy Preston) performed on the Starr track &quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest&quot;, and Voormann did play on solo albums by Lennon, Harrison and Starr, as well as briefly being a member of the Plastic Ono Band. In the 1990s, he designed the artwork for &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; albums.

In 2009, Voormann released his debut solo album &quot;A Sideman&#x27;s Journey&quot;, which featured surviving Beatles McCartney and Starr, performing as &quot;Voormann and Friends&quot;.

Voormann has designed artwork for many bands, including the Beatles, The Dirty Knobs, Harry Nilsson, the Bee Gees, Wet Wet Wet and Turbonegro.

==Early life==

Klaus Otto Wilhelm Voormann was born in Berlin, Germany, and raised in the suburbs of north Berlin. His father was a physician and Klaus was one of six brothers. In an interview for &quot;Talking Germany&quot;, broadcast in July 2010, Voormann discussed his dyslexia.

The Voormann family were interested in art, classical music and books, with a feeling for history and tradition. His parents decided that instead of studying music, it would be best for Klaus to study commercial art in Berlin at the Meisterschule für Grafik und Buchgewerbe. He later moved to Hamburg to study at the Meisterschule für Gestaltung. However, before finishing his education in the graphic arts, Voormann started work as a commercial artist graphic designer and illustrator, spending eight months in Düsseldorf working for magazines.

It was in Hamburg that Voormann first met Astrid Kirchherr. One day, after an argument with her and Jürgen Vollmer, Voormann wandered down the Reeperbahn, in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg, and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. He walked in on a performance by Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. The next group to play was the Beatles. Voormann was left &quot;speechless&quot; by the performances. He had never heard rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll before, having previously only listened to traditional jazz, Nat King Cole, and The Platters. Voormann invited Kirchherr and Vollmer to watch the performances the next day. After joining Voormann at a performance, the trio decided upon spending as much time as possible close to the group and immersing themselves in the music.

The St. Pauli district was a dangerous section of town, with illicit behavior commonplace. It was an area where prostitutes worked, and anyone who looked different from the usual clientele was at risk of violence. As a trio, Voormann, Kirchherr and Vollmer stood out in the Kaiserkeller, dressed in suede coats, wool sweaters, jeans and round-toed shoes, when most of the customers had greased-back Teddy boy hairstyles and wore black leather jackets and pointed boots. During a break, Voormann tried to talk (in faltering English) to Lennon, and pressed a crumpled record sleeve he had designed into Lennon&#x27;s hands. Lennon took little interest, suggesting that he talk to Stu Sutcliffe, who Lennon said was &quot;the artist &#x27;round here&quot;.

Sutcliffe was fascinated by the trio, who he thought looked like &quot;real bohemians&quot;. He later wrote that he could hardly take his eyes off them, and had wanted to talk to them during the next break, but they had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule für Mode, which was the Hamburg equivalent of the Liverpool art college that both Sutcliffe and Lennon had attended. Lennon dubbed the trio the Exies, as a joke about their affection for existentialism.

Voormann was in a relationship with Kirchherr at the time, and lived just around the corner from her parents&#x27; upper-class home in the Altona district of Hamburg. Kirchherr&#x27;s bedroom, which was all in black, including the walls and furniture, was decorated especially for Voormann. After the visits to the Kaiserkeller, their relationship became purely platonic as Astrid started dating Sutcliffe, who was fascinated by her. Nevertheless, she always remained a close friend of Voormann.

==Move to London and affiliation with the Beatles==
In the early 1960s, Voormann decided to leave Germany and move to London. George Harrison invited him to live in the Green Street flat in London&#x27;s Mayfair, formerly shared by all four members of the Beatles: Lennon had moved out to live with his wife Cynthia Lennon, and McCartney went to live in the attic of the home of the parents of his girlfriend Jane Asher. Voormann lived with Harrison and Ringo Starr for a time, before finding work as a commercial artist and renting an apartment of his own. He returned to Hamburg in 1963, where he founded a band called &#x27;Paddy, Klaus &amp; Gibson&#x27; with Paddy Chambers on guitar and vocals, Voormann on bass and vocals and Gibson Kemp on drums.

In 1965, Voormann returned to London and was asked by Lennon to design the sleeve for the album &quot;Revolver&quot;. Voormann had a style of &quot;scrapbook collage&quot; art in mind. The cover went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts. In a major Tate Britain exhibition of the work of the late-Victorian artist Aubrey Beardsley (4 March – 25 May 2020) the &quot;Revolver&quot; cover was displayed to show how interest in Beardsley&#x27;s monochrome pen-and-ink style was revived in the 1960s.
Voormann later designed the cover art for Harrison&#x27;s 1988 single &quot;When We Was Fab&quot;, which included the image of Harrison from the cover of &quot;Revolver&quot; along with an updated drawing in the same style.

Around the same time, Voormann was hired to design the cover for &quot;Bee Gees 1st&quot;, which featured all five group members standing above a colourful, psychedelic collage painted by Voormann. The following year, artwork by Voormann graced the front cover of the American edition of the Bee Gees&#x27; album &quot;Idea&quot;. In 1973, Voormann created the album sleeve and booklet artwork for Starr&#x27;s album &quot;Ringo&quot;, on which he also played bass.

In 1966, Voormann became a member of Manfred Mann, having turned down offers by the Hollies and the Moody Blues, although Voormann did substitute for Eric Haydock on a couple of television performances by the Hollies. Voormann mentions his negotiations with the group in his autobiography, &quot;Warum spielst Du &quot;Imagine&quot; nicht auf dem weißen Klavier, John?&quot; (&quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Play &quot;Imagine&quot; on the White Piano, John?&quot;). Voormann played bass and flutes for Manfred Mann from 1966 to 1969, appearing on all their UK hits from &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; (July 1966) to their final single &quot;Ragamuffin Man&quot; (April 1969) and including the 1968 international hit &quot;The Mighty Quinn&quot;.

After that, Voormann became a session musician, playing on solo projects by Lou Reed, Carly Simon, James Taylor and Harry Nilsson, among others. He was a member of Yoko Ono and Lennon&#x27;s Plastic Ono Band, with Ono, Alan White and Eric Clapton, playing on their album &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;, recorded in Toronto on 13 September that year, prior to the break-up of the Beatles.

After the Beatles disbanded, there were rumours of them reforming as the Ladders, with Voormann on bass as a replacement for Paul McCartney, but the plan never materialised. This line-up (Voormann, Lennon, Harrison and Starr) did perform on Starr&#x27;s 1973 song &quot;I&#x27;m the Greatest&quot;. Voormann served as the three former Beatles&#x27; bassist of choice through the mid-1970s, playing on Lennon&#x27;s albums &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; (1970), &quot;Imagine&quot; (1971), &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; (1972), &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; (1974) and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1975); Harrison&#x27;s &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (1970), &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; (1973), &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (1974) and &quot;Extra Texture (Read All About It)&quot; (1975); and Starr&#x27;s &quot;Ringo&quot; (1973), &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot; (1974) and &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Rotogravure&quot; (1976). He played bass at Harrison&#x27;s Concert for Bangladesh shows, at which Starr also appeared, in August 1971. That year, Lennon told an interviewer that although the Beatles had disbanded, &quot;if you&#x27;d said that George, Ringo and John had an idea they might play a live show or two, then Klaus would be our man to play with us.&quot;

==Studio work in Los Angeles==
In 1971, Voormann moved to Los Angeles. He played in Harrison&#x27;s band at The Concert for Bangladesh, held at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in August 1971. Harrison introduced him to the audience by saying, &quot;There&#x27;s somebody on bass who many people have heard about, but they&#x27;ve never actually seen him – Klaus Voormann.&quot; Voormann contributed bass to Joe Yamanaka&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;To the New World&quot;.

==Return to Germany==
In 1979, Voormann moved back to Germany; he had a cameo as Von Schnitzel the Conductor in the 1980 film adaptation of &quot;Popeye&quot;. He went on to produce three studio albums and a live album by the German band Trio, as well as their worldwide hit single &quot;Da Da Da&quot;. After Trio broke up in 1986, Voormann produced the first solo album by their singer Stephan Remmler and played bass on some songs of the album. The following year, he produced a single by former Trio drummer Peter Behrens.

==Semi-retirement==
Voormann retired from the music business in 1989, deciding to spend more time with his family. He lives at Lake Starnberg, near Munich with his second wife Christina and their two children, born in 1989 and 1991. From time to time, he appears on television programmes. In 1995, Voormann was asked by Apple Records to design the covers for &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot; albums. He painted the covers along with his friend, fellow artist Alfons Kiefer. In the 1994 movie &quot;Backbeat&quot;, about the Hamburg days of the Beatles, Voormann was portrayed by German actor Kai Wiesinger. In 2000, Voormann also designed the cover for &quot;Me Rio&quot;, the debut album of Enja Records recording artist Azhar Kamal, which was influenced by his design for &quot;Revolver&quot;.

On 29 November 2002 Voormann played bass on the song &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; at the Concert for George, held at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. In an interview with author Simon Leng, he described Harrison as not only a &quot;really great guitarist&quot; but &quot;the best friend I ever had&quot;.

In April 2003 Voormann designed the cover of &quot;Scandinavian Leather&quot; for the Norwegian band Turbonegro. In October that same year, he published his autobiography, &quot;Warum spielst du Imagine nicht auf dem weißen Klavier, John? Erinnerungen an die Beatles und viele andere Freunde&quot; (&quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Play &quot;Imagine&quot; on the White Piano, John?: Memories of the Beatles and Many Other Friends&quot;); the book gives special focus to the 1960s and 1970s, and covers Voormann&#x27;s close friendship with the Beatles and other musicians and artists, as well as his private life. A BBC documentary, &quot;Stuart Sutcliffe: The Lost Beatle&quot;, broadcast in 2005, features interviews with Voormann and shows drawings he made of the Beatles in Hamburg. That year also saw the publication of his book &quot;Four Track Stories&quot;, which contains his experiences with the Beatles during the Hamburg days, stories narrated both in English and German, and pictures made by him. In 2007 he designed the sleeve for the album &quot;Timeless&quot; by Wet Wet Wet.

==Comeback==

On 7 July 2009, Voormann released his first solo album, &quot;A Sideman&#x27;s Journey&quot;. It was credited to &#x27;Voormann &amp; Friends&#x27; and featured McCartney, Starr, Yusuf Islam (formerly known as Cat Stevens), Don Preston, Dr. John, The Manfreds, Jim Keltner, Van Dyke Parks, Joe Walsh and many others. The album has been available in a limited number of audio CDs, vinyl LPs, and deluxe box sets with original (and signed) graphics by Voormann; and included new versions of old songs such as &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)&quot;. A bonus DVD of &quot;Making of a Sideman&#x27;s Journey&quot; was released with the album.

On 30 June 2010, Franco-German television network ARTE released a 90-minute documentary entitled &quot;All You Need is Klaus&quot;, which featured footage from the &#x27;Voormann &amp; Friends&#x27; sessions, as well as interview footage with Voormann and some of the artists he had collaborated with in his storied career.

==Art==

In 2014, Voormann designed the cover to the album &quot;Music Life&quot; by Japanese rock band Glay; the image depicting the face of each member of the band is strongly reminiscent of the cover to The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot;.

In 2016, Voormann created a graphic novel based on his experiences recording &quot;Revolver&quot;, calling it &quot;Revolver 50. Birth of an Icon&quot;. In 2017, he designed the artwork featured in the deluxe box set edition of &quot;As You Were&quot;, the debut solo album from Liam Gallagher. He also made a surreal pencil drawing of &quot;Mad&quot; magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman for the publication&#x27;s December 2017 issue.

Voormann designed the cover art and booklet sketch of the album &quot;¡Spangled!&quot;, by Gaby Moreno and Van Dyke Parks, released in 2019.

In 2020, Voormann did the cover art for &quot;Wreckless Abandon&quot;, an album by Mike Campbell&#x27;s band The Dirty Knobs.

<text>Salami ( ; : &quot;salame&quot;) is a &quot;salume&quot; consisting of fermented and air-dried meat, typically pork. Historically, salami was popular among Southern, Eastern, and Central European peasants because it can be stored at room temperature for up to 45 days once cut, supplementing a potentially meager or inconsistent supply of fresh meat. Countries and regions across Europe make their own traditional varieties of salami.

Small-sized salami are also referred to as &quot;salametti&quot; or &quot;salamini&quot;.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;salami&quot; in English comes from the plural form of the Italian (). It is a singular or plural word in English for cured meats of a European (particularly Italian) style. In Romanian, Bulgarian, and Turkish, the word is &quot;salam&quot;; in Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian it is &quot;salama&quot;; in Hungarian it is &quot;szalámi&quot;; in Czech it is &quot;salám&quot;; in Slovak it is &quot;saláma&quot;; in Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian it is &quot;salyami&quot;; and Polish, French, German, Greek, and Dutch have the same word as English. The name may be derived from the Latin word &quot;salumen&quot;.

The word originates from the word &quot;sale&quot; () with a termination (&quot;-ame&quot;), which in Italian indicates a collective noun. Thus, it originally referred to all types of salted meats. The Italian tradition of cured meats includes several styles, and the word &quot;salame&quot; soon specifically meant only the most popular type—a salted and spiced meat, ground and extruded into an elongated, thin casing (usually cleaned animal intestine), then left to undergo natural fermentation and drying for days, months, or even years.

==Origin and history==
Fermentation—allowing beneficial or benign organisms to grow in food to prevent destructive or toxic ones from growing—has been around for thousands of years. Environmental conditions dictate what food processes are used, as seen in the Mediterranean and Southern Europe, where &quot;meat products are dried to lower water activity (Aw) values, taking advantage of the long, dry and sunny days, while in Northern Europe, fermented sausages require smoking for further preservation&quot;.

The modern recipe of salami probably originated in Italy in the early 18th century. It was adopted later in other countries, particularly in Central Europe, with adapted manufacturing procedures. At that time, it was largely consumed by the wealthy, as meat in general was very expensive.
In Europe, the main countries that produce salami are France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Spain, which make several hundred million kilograms per year.

Worldwide, the many different versions of sausage each have their own cultural and flavor profiles. Additionally, each sausage has its own type of seasonings and amount of salt, making each flavor and texture unique. This wide array of fermented sausages, especially in terms of salami, shows its ubiquitous but exclusive nature. For example, due to emigration to North America, European settlers brought many traditions, including fermented meats such as pepperoni. Similar types of sausages are found in the Middle East, where various meats such as beef, lamb, and mutton are used; or in China, where &quot;lap cheong&quot; () are usually pork.

Likewise, in Central Europe, Hungarian salami is quite popular. Hungarian salami is &quot;intensively smoked, and then its surface is inoculated with mold starters or spontaneous mold growth&quot;.

In the United States, National Salami Day is celebrated on September 7 of each year.

==Ingredients==

A traditional &quot;salami&quot;, with its typical marbled appearance, is made from beef or pork (sometimes specifically veal). Beef is usual in halal and kosher salami, which never include pork for religious reasons. Makers also use other meats, including venison and poultry (mostly turkey). Goose salami is traditional in parts of northern Italy. Salami has also been made from horse meat. In the Provence region of France and in the Veneto region of Italy donkey meat is used for salami, as well, the product being sold in street markets.
Typical additional ingredients include:
* Garlic
* Minced fat
* Salt
* Spices, usually white pepper
* Various herbs
* Vinegar
* Wine

The maker usually ferments the raw meat mixture for a day, then stuffs it into either an edible natural or inedible cellulose casing, and hangs it up to cure. Some recipes apply heat to about 40 °C (104 °F) to accelerate fermentation and drying. Higher temperatures (about 60 °C (140 °F)) stop the fermentation when the salami reaches the desired pH, but the product is not fully cooked (75 °C (167 °F) or higher). Makers often treat the casings with an edible mold (&quot;Penicillium&quot;) culture. The mold imparts flavor, helps the drying process, and helps prevent spoilage during curing.

==Manufacturing process==

Although completely uncooked, salami is not raw, but cured. &quot;Salame cotto&quot; ()—typical of the Piedmont region of Italy—is cooked or smoked before or after curing to impart a specific flavor, but not for any benefit of cooking. Before cooking, a &quot;salame cotto&quot; is considered raw and not ready to eat.

Three major stages are involved in the production of salami: preparation of raw materials, fermentation, and ripening and drying. Minor differences in the formulation of the meat or production techniques give rise to the various types of salami across different countries.

===Preparation===
Before fermentation, raw meat (usually pork or beef depending on the type of salami that is produced) is ground (usually coarsely) and mixed with other ingredients such as salt, sugar, spices, pepper and, if the particular salami variety requires it, lactic acid bacterial starter culture.

===Fermentation===
This mixture is then inserted into casings of the desired size. To achieve the flavor and texture that salami possesses, fermentation, which can also be referred to as a slow acidification process promoting a series of chemical reactions in the meat, has to take place. Direct acidification of meat was found to be inappropriate for salami production, since it causes protein denaturation and an uneven coagulation, thereby causing an undesirable texture in the salami.
For a more modern controlled fermentation, makers hang the salami in warm, humid conditions for 1–3 days to encourage the fermenting bacteria to grow, then hang it in a cool, humid environment to slowly dry. In a traditional process, the maker skips the fermentation step and immediately hangs the salami in a cool, humid curing environment. Added sugars (usually dextrose) provide a food source for the curing bacteria.

The bacteria produce lactic acid as a waste product, which lowers the pH and coagulates the proteins, reducing the meat&#x27;s water-holding capacity. The bacteria-produced acid makes the meat an inhospitable environment for pathogenic bacteria and imparts a tangy flavor that distinguishes salami from machine-dried pork. Salami flavor relies as much on how these bacteria are cultivated as it does on the quality and variety of the other ingredients. Originally, makers introduced wine into the mix, favouring the growth of other beneficial bacteria. Now, they use starter cultures.

The climate of the curing environment, casing size, and style determine the drying and curing process. According to the particular variety of salami, different fermentation methods involving different acids have been explored to create various colors and flavors. Starter cultures, such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and coagulase-negative cocci (CNC), such as specific strains of &quot;Staphylococcus xylosus&quot; or &quot;Micrococcus&quot;, are most commonly used in salami production. More species of LAB and CNC were discovered during recent decades and they were found to have different fermentation temperatures with variable rates of acidification. Despite the fact that these bacteria can help maintain a longer shelf life for meat products and even retard the growth of pathogens, there are a few studies that argue some starter cultures may be related to the production of enterotoxins or biogenic amines that can be harmful to the human body. Therefore, starter cultures have to be carefully selected by producers and properly used in fermentation.

===Drying===

After fermentation, the sausage must be dried. This changes the casings from water-permeable to reasonably airtight. A white covering of either mold or flour helps prevent photo-oxidation of the meat and rancidity in the fat.

Ripening and drying happens after fermentation. This stage causes the main physical and microbial changes through the large amount of water loss. About half of the water is evaporated and further water loss has to be prevented by packaging. Nonuniform drying processes could cause the formation of a hard shell on the surface of salami. This is similar to other food products such as fruits that undergo dehydration to decrease the risk of diseases or spoilage-causing microbial growth. In modern manufacturing temperature and relative humidity are strictly controlled according to the size of the salami.

Nitrates or nitrites may be added to provide additional color and inhibit growth of harmful bacteria from the genus &quot;Clostridium&quot;. Salt, acidity, nitrate/nitrite levels, and dryness of the fully cured salami combine to make the uncooked meat safe to consume. High quality, fresh ingredients are important to helping prevent deadly microorganisms and toxins from developing.

==Properties==
The quality of salami is dependent on the quality of the raw materials and the level of technology used in its production. The aroma and taste of salami are developed by enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions. The characteristic fermented meat flavor is believed to be developed by a combination of endogenous enzymatic activities and the lactic acid produced by the starter culture. Lactic acid bacteria develop the tangy flavor of salami through the fermentation of carbohydrates and produces an appealing red color to the meat after fermentation, while coagulase-negative cocci can catabolize amino acids and fatty acids to produce volatile compounds. The flavor itself consists of odour properties, which comes from volatile substances, and taste and tactile properties, which comes from non-volatile substances that are a result of enhancers and synergists.

When smoke is applied to salami, it also affects the taste, smell, appearance, and texture. Some of these changes are due to the formation of phenolic compounds, which slow fat oxidation. The pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicelluloses in the salami casing produces carbonyls, which develop the color of the meat.

More than 400 volatile compounds have been identified in different types of dry-fermented sausages. For example, the organic compounds identified in Hungarian salami produced the dominant flavors of smokiness, sweetness, pungency, sourness, and cloves; secondary flavors included cooked meat, cheese, popcorn, cooked potato, mushroom, seasoning, phenols, roasting, sulfur, and sweatiness. Some minor flavors included malt, garlic, fruit, pine, grass, citrus, honey, caramel, and vanilla. The overall smoky note is the result of numerous phenols. Whether these odorants are formed in the salami or simply transferred from the raw materials during manufacturing is unknown; systematic studies have yet to compare the odorants present in the raw materials to those in the final product.

==Shelf life==
Salami will remain stable for long periods of time, as it has a low water activity and contains preservatives, colorings, flavorings, antioxidants and acidifying cultures. Semi-ripened salami will maintain its flavor for a long time under retail display conditions, but it will eventually deteriorate due to the development of incipient rancidity. The shelf life of salami is mainly determined by sensory deterioration, which is the result of various oxidation phenomena; pathogenic or spoilage bacteria do not readily proliferate in dry-cured sausage. The main cause of flavor deterioration in dry-cured sausage is rancidity, although the possible formation of other off-flavors, such as mouldy, acid, putrid or pungent traits, may contribute to the decreased quality.

The use of coriander essential oil in salami has been shown to increase the higher synthetic antioxidant effect of butylated hydroxytoluene, which delays lipid oxidation and the rancid aroma and taste that come with it. Additionally, salami with coriander essential oil shows improvements in the sensory attributes of taste, odor, texture, brightness, and red color intensity.

==Varieties==



Salami (: &quot;salame&quot;) varieties from Italian-speaking regions include:
* Cacciatore (or cacciatora)
* &quot;Ciauscolo&quot;
* &quot;Felino&quot;
* &quot;Finocchiona&quot;
* &quot;Genovese di Sant&#x27;Olcese&quot;
* &#x27;Nduja
* &quot;Soppressata&quot;
* &quot;Strolghino&quot;
* &quot;Ticinese&quot; (also called &quot;salame nostrano&quot;)

Other salami varieties include:
* Pepperoni
* &quot;Sibiu Salami&quot;
* Winter salami

Many Old World salami are named after their region or country of origin—such as Genoa and Hungarian salami, and &quot;salame Milano&quot;. Many are flavored with garlic. Some types—including some varieties from Hungary (pick salami), and Italy (such as Neapolitan varieties that led to American pepperoni) include paprika or chili powder. Varieties also differ by coarseness or fineness of the chopped meat and size and style of the casing.

Naples-type salami is also a popular southern Italian dry fermented sausage made of coarsely minced pork meat. In northeast Italy, traditional dry fermented salami sausages made of fresh pork display unique organoleptic sensory profiles characterized by accented acidity, slight sourness, and elastic semi hard consistency. Other popular dry salamis in Italy are mainly made from a combination of pork and small bits of beef, seasoned with garlic; pepperoni is also made of pork and beef, and is usually smoked; chorizo is highly spiced and smoked.

Hungarian-type salami is a specialty in salami production, because it is first slightly smoked and mold-ripened afterward. &quot;Szegedi téliszalámi&quot;, a Hungarian winter salami, is made of raw pork, bacon, salt, spices, sugars, and sodium nitrite. The Mangalitsa pork breed, with equine large intestine used as its casing to preserve and serve it. This type acquires a grey mold cover on it and has a firm texture and excellent keeping quality after a 30% weight loss reached in 3 to 4 months.

Dry fermented sausage (&quot;salami aeros&quot;) is an important product of the Greek meat industry with an annual production of about 10,000 tons. Its manufacture varies depending on the skill and experience of the meat manufacturer rather than a process solely based on scientific and technological means of production. This type of traditional sausage, which undergoes spontaneous fermentation, is of superior quality compared to those inoculated with starters and made at industrial scale. This type of traditional salami is often more expensive due to its high quality.

In Germany, Westphalian salami is made with fast technology from pork meat, pepper, garlic, and sometimes mustard seeds, and is a smoked, firm, sliceable product with a distinctly fermented/sour flavor. The sausages are stuffed into large-diameter casings and ripened by lowering the temperature from 24 °C to 12–14 °C until a water loss of 25% is obtained.

In the Netherlands, the most popular Dutch products are finely chopped salami, &quot;Cervelat&quot;, &quot;Snijworst&quot; (with high fat content and rind added), &quot;Boerenmetworst&quot; (which is coarsely chopped), and chorizo (which is less spicy than the Spanish product). In Russia, typical products are Moscow-type and Russian-type salamis made from pork and beef meat. A particular feature of Moscow-type salami is the large size of fat particles (7–8 mm) that give the sausage a rough cover.

==Health effects==

Salami has been found to be a possible allergen to some people due to the use of penicillium species mold starter during the drying and curing portion of processing to add flavor and stop growth of undesirable molds. These molds occur predominantly in the skin of salami.

Fermented pork back fat that is used to make salami has very high saturated fatty acid and cholesterol content, which are believed to be risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, it has been shown that it is possible to replace the pork back fat in salami with extra virgin olive oil, thereby changing the fatty acid profile of the salami. Olive oil contains far more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, so this substitution purportedly creates a healthier product. Salami is considered slightly acidic due to lactic acid that is present. Salami where extra virgin olive oil was substituted for the pork back fat has been shown to have a lower pH of around 5.00 compared to its original levels of around 6.35 to 6.55, making the salami more acidic. These lower pH levels are healthier for humans as higher populations of lactic acid bacteria inhibit the spread of spoilage microorganisms.

In 1994, there was an outbreak of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; O157 with 17 cases all occurring from the consumption of pre-sliced salami that was processed by one company. A research investigation of the factory where the salami was processed found that all processing techniques and production methods complied with all regulations, and there was no evidence of contamination after processing.

Preservation of any meat products is important. Some fungi can create undesirable color and flavor in the contaminated meat and produce toxins. Some fungi that are not harmful to humans, such as those that are formed on the surface of dried salami, are an indication of maturation after ripening. Thus, producers have to eliminate fungi that have potential risks to human health. As natural preservatives are becoming more desirable food additives than artificial preservatives in food industries, some studies about salami have been focusing on the use of essential oils such as oregano and clove oil as preservatives that can be applied to salami production due to their anti-fungal activities. Several types of oils including rosemary, clove, oregano and sage oils were found to have different levels of inhibitory effect to various types of fungi that could possibly grow on salami. Since several of these oils contain volatile compounds whose amount can affect the flavor of the food, researchers often perform a sensory test to find the amount of the oil that can best serve as an anti-fungal preservative but have the least effect on the flavor or appearance of the salami.

<text>Sauerkraut (; , ) is finely cut raw cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria. It has a long shelf life and a distinctive sour flavor, both of which result from the lactic acid formed when the bacteria ferment the sugars in the cabbage leaves.

==Overview and history==

Fermented foods have a long history in many cultures. The Roman writers Cato (in his &quot;De agri cultura&quot;) and Columella (in his &quot;De re Rustica&quot;) mentioned preserving cabbages and turnips with salt. According to Wilhelm Holzapfel et al, Plinius the Elder, writing in the first century A.D., is reputed to have been the first writer to describe the making of sauerkraut by preserving what the Romans called &quot;salt cabbage&quot; in earthen vessels. Popular folklore has imagined that sauerkraut was introduced to Europe by the trade networks formed across Eurasia by the Golden Horde. However, according to Mack and Surina (2005), there is no evidence to support this theory, nor any evidence that fermented cabbage arrived from an East Asian source, and there is evidence of sauerkraut production in Europe dating back to the early period of the Western Roman Empire.

Although &quot;sauerkraut&quot; is from a German word (&quot;Sauerkraut&quot;), the dish did not originate in Germany. Some claim fermenting cabbage &quot;suan cai&quot; was already practised in the days of the building of the Great Wall of China. However, the Romans, as previously noted, pickled forms of cabbage, and were the more likely source of modern-day European sauerkraut. It then took root in Central and Eastern European cuisines, but also in other countries including the Netherlands, where it is known as &quot;zuurkool&quot;, and France, where the name became &quot;choucroute&quot;. According to Mack and Surina (2005), the Slavic peoples of Europe likely discovered fermented cabbage on their own. The English name is borrowed from German where it means &quot;sour cabbage&quot;.

The names in Slavic and other Central and Eastern European languages have similar meanings with the German word: &quot;fermented cabbage&quot; (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot;kvashena kapusta&quot;).

Before frozen foods, refrigeration, and cheap transport from warmer areas became readily available in Northern, Central, and Eastern Europe, sauerkraut – like other preserved foods – provided a source of nutrients during the winter. Captain James Cook always took a store of sauerkraut on his sea voyages, since experience had taught him it prevented scurvy.

The word &quot;Kraut&quot;, derived from this food, is a derogatory term for the German people. During World War I, due to concerns the American public would reject a product with a German name, American sauerkraut makers relabeled their product as &quot;liberty cabbage&quot; for the duration of the war.

==Production==

Sauerkraut is made by a process of pickling called lactic acid fermentation that is analogous to how traditional (not heat-treated) pickled cucumbers and kimchi are made. The cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt, and left to ferment. Fully cured sauerkraut keeps for several months in an airtight container stored at 15 °C (60 °F) or below. In temperate climates, this allows storage over the full winter and early-Spring. Neither refrigeration nor pasteurization is required, although these treatments prolong storage life.

Fermentation by lactobacilli is introduced naturally, as these air-borne bacteria culture on raw cabbage leaves where they grow. Yeasts also are present, and may yield soft sauerkraut of poor flavor when the fermentation temperature is too high. The fermentation process has three phases, collectively sometimes referred to as population dynamics. In the first phase, anaerobic bacteria such as &quot;Klebsiella&quot; and &quot;Enterobacter&quot; lead the fermentation, and begin producing an acidic environment that favors later bacteria. The second phase starts as the acid levels become too high for many bacteria, and &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot; and other &quot;Leuconostoc&quot; species take dominance. In the third phase, various &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species, including &quot;L. brevis&quot; and &quot;L. plantarum&quot;, ferment any remaining sugars, further lowering the pH. Properly cured sauerkraut is sufficiently acidic to prevent a favorable environment for the growth of &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;, the toxins of which cause botulism.

A 2004 genomic study found an unexpectedly large diversity of lactic acid bacteria in sauerkraut, and that previous studies had oversimplified this diversity. &quot;Weissella&quot; was found to be a major organism in the initial, heterofermentative stage, up to day 7. It was also found that &quot;Lactobacillus brevis&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus pentosaceus&quot; had smaller population numbers in the first 14 days than previous studies had reported.

The Dutch sauerkraut industry found that combining a new batch of sauerkraut with an old batch resulted in an exceedingly sour product. This sourdough process is known as &quot;backslopping&quot; or &quot;inoculum enrichment&quot;; when used in making sauerkraut, first- and second-stage population dynamics, important to developing flavor, are bypassed. This is due primarily to the greater initial activity of species &quot;L. plantarum&quot;.

==Regional varieties==

In Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Czech, Slovak, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian cuisine, chopped cabbage is often pickled together with shredded carrots. Other ingredients may include caraway seeds, whole or quartered apples for additional flavor or cranberry for flavor and better keeping (the benzoic acid in cranberries is a common preservative). Bell peppers and beets are added in some recipes for color. The resulting sauerkraut salad is typically served cold, as &quot;zakuski&quot; or a side dish.

A homemade type of very mild sauerkraut is available, where white cabbage is pickled with salt in a refrigerator for only three to seven days. This process results in very little lactic acid production. Sometimes in Russia double fermentation is used, with the initial step producing an exceptionally sour product, which is then &quot;corrected&quot; by adding 30-50% more fresh cabbage and fermenting the mix again. The flavor additives like apples, beets, cranberries, and sometimes even watermelons are usually introduced at this step.

Sauerkraut may be used as a filling for Polish &quot;pierogi&quot;, Ukrainian &quot;varenyky&quot;, Russian &quot;pirogi&quot; and &quot;pirozhki&quot;. Sauerkraut is also the central ingredient in traditional soups, such as &quot;shchi&quot; (a national dish of Russia), &quot;kwaśnica&quot; (Poland), &quot;kapustnica&quot; (Slovakia), and &quot;zelňačka&quot; (Czech Republic resp. Moravian). It is an ingredient of Polish &quot;bigos&quot; (a hunter&#x27;s stew).

In Ukraine, sauerkraut is known as () &#x27;sour cabbage&#x27; or () &#x27;fermented cabbage&#x27;.

In Russia, sauerkraut is known as () &#x27;sour cabbage&#x27; or () &#x27;fermented cabbage&#x27;.

In Germany and Austria, cooked sauerkraut is often flavored with juniper berries or caraway seeds; apples and white wine are added in popular variations. In South Tyrol, it is made with Juniper berries, Extra-virgin olive oil and smoked pancetta. Traditionally it is served warm, with pork (e.g. &quot;eisbein&quot;, &quot;schweinshaxe&quot;, &quot;Kassler&quot;) or sausages (smoked or fried sausages, &quot;Frankfurter Würstchen&quot;, Vienna sausages, black pudding), accompanied typically by roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings (&quot;knödel&quot; or &quot;schupfnudel&quot;). Similar recipes are common in other Central European cuisines. The Czech national dish &quot;vepřo knedlo zelo&quot; consists of roast pork with &quot;knedliky&quot; and sauerkraut.

In Bulgaria, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, North Macedonia and Slovenia, usually the whole cabbage heads are pickled. Such produce is used for many dishes, from a simple salad made of chopped cabbage and sprinkled with paprika, to cabbage rolls. In Bulgarian cuisine sauerkraut is known as &quot;кисело зеле&quot;, and many of traditional Bulgarian dishes is made with sauerkraut, like свинско със зеле(pork with sauerkraut), сарми(cabbage rolls), зелник(Bulgarian banitsa with sauerkraut), капама(sausage and meat with cabbage rolls and sauerkraut in clay pot), боб със зеле(beans with sauerkraut) and салата от кисело зеле с червен пипер(sauerkraut salad with paprika). In northern parts of Serbia and Croatia, it is often added to the bean soup. In central Serbia, a local specialty called &quot;wedding cabbage&quot; is made by slowly stewing roughly cut cabbage with at least three kinds of meats, lean, fatty, and smoked.

In Szeklerland it is an essential part of &quot;székelygulyás&quot; and the &quot;erdélyi rakott káposzta&quot; (a type of casserole).

In Romania, the local type of sauerkraut (&quot;varza murata&quot; = whole pickled cabbage heads) are used as wrap for the national dish called &quot;Sarmale&quot;, a Turkish-inspired roll, made of pickled cabbage leaves with minced pork and rice, having its own personality and very distinct in taste from its Ottoman predecessor.

In France, sauerkraut is the main ingredient of the Alsatian meal &quot;choucroute garnie&quot; (French for &quot;dressed sauerkraut&quot;), sauerkraut with sausages (Strasbourg sausages, smoked Morteau or Montbéliard sausages), charcuterie (bacon, ham, etc.), and often potatoes.

In Chile it is called &quot;chucrut&quot; and is a common topping for sandwiches and hotdogs, especially for completos.

Sauerkraut, along with pork, is eaten traditionally in Pennsylvania on New Year&#x27;s Day. The tradition, started by the Pennsylvania Dutch, is thought to bring good luck for the upcoming year. Sauerkraut is also used in American cuisine as a condiment upon various foods, such as sandwiches and hot dogs. In Maryland, particularly in Baltimore and on the Eastern Shore, sauerkraut is a traditional accompaniment for the Thanksgiving turkey.

As Europeans, especially Germans, emigrated to other countries, many of them continued making and eating sauerkraut around the world.

==Health effects==

===Benefits===
Many health benefits have been claimed for sauerkraut:

* It is a high source of vitamins K and (if uncooked) C; the fermentation process increases the bioavailability of nutrients rendering sauerkraut even more nutritious than the original cabbage. It is also low in food energy and high in calcium and magnesium, and it is a very good source of dietary fiber, folate, iron, potassium, copper and manganese.
* If unpasteurized and uncooked, sauerkraut also contains live lactobacilli and beneficial microbes and is rich in enzymes. Fiber and probiotics improve digestion and promote the growth of healthy bowel flora, protecting against many diseases of the digestive tract.

* During the American Civil War, the physician John Jay Terrell (1829–1922) was able to successfully reduce the death rate from disease among prisoners of war; he attributed this to feeding his patients raw sauerkraut.
* Sauerkraut and its juice is a time-honored folk remedy for canker sores. The treatment is to rinse the mouth with sauerkraut juice for about 30 seconds several times a day, or place a wad of sauerkraut against the affected area for a minute or so before chewing and swallowing the sauerkraut.
* In 2002, the &quot;Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry&quot; reported that Finnish researchers found the isothiocyanates produced in sauerkraut fermentation inhibit the growth of cancer cells in test tube and animal studies. A Polish study in 2010 concluded that &quot;induction of the key detoxifying enzymes by cabbage juices, particularly sauerkraut, may be responsible for their chemopreventive activity demonstrated by epidemiological studies and in animal models&quot;.
* Sauerkraut was one of the foods taken by English explorer James Cook on his first and second pacific voyages as a way to prevent scurvy. 

===Disadvantages===

Excessive consumption of sauerkraut may lead to bloating and flatulence due to the trisaccharide raffinose, which the human small intestine cannot break down. This does not negatively affect long-term health, although it might be uncomfortable. Additionally, sauerkraut has a very high sodium content.

<text>Kimchi (; , ) is a traditional Korean side dish (&quot;banchan&quot;) consisting of salted and fermented vegetables, most often napa cabbage or Korean radish. A wide selection of seasonings are used, including &quot;gochugaru&quot; (Korean chili powder), spring onions, garlic, ginger, and &quot;jeotgal&quot; (a salted seafood). Kimchi is also used in a variety of soups and stews. Kimchi is a staple food in Korean cuisine and is eaten as a side dish with almost every Korean meal.

There are hundreds of different types of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients. Traditionally, winter kimchi, called &quot;gimjang&quot;, was stored in large earthenware fermentation vessels, called &quot;onggi&quot;, in the ground to prevent freezing during the winter months and to keep it cool enough to slow down the fermentation process during summer months. The process of making kimchi was called kimjang and was a way for the whole village to participate. The vessels are also kept outdoors in special terraces called jangdokdae. In contemporary times, household kimchi refrigerators are more commonly used.

== Etymology ==

=== &quot;Ji&quot; ===
The term &quot;ji&quot; (), which has its origins in archaic Korean &quot;dihi&quot; (), has been used to refer to kimchi since ancient times. The sound change can be roughly described as:
* &quot;dihi&quot; () &gt; &quot;di&quot; () &gt; &quot;ji&quot; ()
The Middle Korean form &quot;dihi&quot; is found in several books from the Joseon period (1392–1897). In Modern Korean, the word remains as the suffix &quot;-ji&quot; in the standard language (as in &quot;jjanji&quot;, &quot;seokbak-ji&quot;), and as the suffix &quot;-ji&quot; as well as the noun &quot;ji&quot; in Gyeongsang and Jeolla dialects. The unpalatalized form &quot;di&quot; is preserved in P&#x27;yŏngan dialect.

=== &quot;Kimchi&quot; ===
&quot;Kimchi&quot; () is the accepted word in both North and South Korean standard languages. Earlier forms of the word include (), a Middle Korean transcription of the Sino-Korean word (literally &quot;submerged vegetable&quot;). appears in &quot;Sohak Eonhae&quot;, the 16th century Korean rendition of the Chinese book, &quot;Xiaoxue&quot;. Sound changes from Middle Korean to Modern Korean regarding the word can be described as:

The aspirated first consonant of became unaspirated in , then underwent palatalization in . The word then became with the loss of the vowel () in Korean language, then &quot;kimchi&quot;, with the depalatalized word-initial consonant. In Modern Korean, the hanja characters are pronounced &quot;chimchae&quot; (), and are not used to refer to kimchi, or anything else. The word &quot;kimchi&quot; is not considered as a Sino-Korean word. Older forms of the word are retained in many regional dialects: &quot;jimchae&quot; (Jeolla, Hamgyŏng dialects), &quot;jimchi&quot; (Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsang, Hamgyŏng, Jeolla dialects), and &quot;dimchi&quot; (P&#x27;yŏngan dialect).

The English word &quot;kimchi&quot; perhaps originated from &quot;kimch&#x27;i&quot;, the McCune–Reischauer transcription of the Korean word &quot;kimchi&quot; ().

== History ==
=== Early history ===
&quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, a historical record of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, mentions the pickle jar used to ferment vegetables, which indicates that fermented vegetables were commonly eaten during this time. Attributed with the earliest kimchi, the Goguryeo people were skilled at fermenting and widely consumed fermented food. During the Silla dynasty (57 BCE – CE 935), kimchi became prevalent as Buddhism caught on throughout the nation and fostered a vegetarian lifestyle. 

The pickling of vegetables was an ideal method, prior to refrigerators, that helped to preserve the lifespan of foods. In Korea, kimchi was made during the winter by fermenting vegetables, and burying it in the ground in traditional brown ceramic pots called &quot;onggi&quot;. This labor further allowed a bonding among women within the family. A poem on Korean radish written by Yi Gyubo, a 13th-century literatus, shows that radish kimchi was common in Goryeo (918–1392).

Kimchi has been a staple in Korean culture, but historical versions were not a spicy dish. Early records of kimchi do not mention garlic or chili pepper. Chili peppers, now a standard ingredient in kimchi, had been unknown in Korea until the early seventeenth century due to it being a New World crop. Chili peppers, originally native to the Americas, were introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders. The first mention of chili pepper is found in &quot;Jibong yuseol&quot;, an encyclopedia published in 1614. &quot;Sallim gyeongje&quot;, a 17‒18th century book on farm management, wrote on kimchi with chili peppers. However, it was not until the 19th century that the use of chili peppers in kimchi became widespread. Recipes from the early 19th century closely resemble today&#x27;s kimchi.

A 1766 book, &quot;Jeungbo sallim gyeongje&quot;, reports kimchi varieties made with myriad ingredients, including &quot;chonggak-kimchi&quot; (kimchi made with chonggak radish), &quot;oi-sobagi&quot; (with cucumber), &quot;seokbak-ji&quot; (with &quot;jogi-jeot&quot;), and &quot;dongchimi&quot;. However, napa cabbage was introduced to Korea only at the end of 19th century, and whole-cabbage kimchi similar to its current form is described in &quot;Siuijeonseo&quot;, a cookbook published around that time.

=== Modern history ===
During South Korea&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War, the industrialization and commercialization of kimchi production became increasingly important because the Korean government wanted to provide rations for its troops. The Korean government requested American help to ensure that South Korean troops, reportedly &quot;desperate&quot; for the food, could obtain it in the field.

In 2008, South Korean scientists created a special low-calorie, vitamin-rich &quot;space kimchi&quot; for Yi So-yeon, the first Korean astronaut, to take to space. It was bacteria-free, unlike normal kimchi in which bacteria are essential for fermentation. It was feared that cosmic rays might mutate the bacteria.

South Korea developed programs for adult Korean adoptees to return to South Korea and learn about what it means to be Korean. One of these programs was learning how to make kimchi.

==== 1996 kimchi standard dispute with Japan ====
In 1996, Korea protested against Japanese commercial production of kimchi arguing that the Japanese-produced product (&quot;&quot;, ) was different from kimchi. In particular, Japanese kimchi was not fermented and was more similar to asazuke. Korea lobbied for an international standard from the Codex Alimentarius, an organization associated with the World Health Organization that defines voluntary standards for food preparation for international trade purposes. In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as &quot;a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature&quot;, but which neither specified a minimum amount of fermentation nor forbade the use of any additives. Following the inclusion of the kimchi standard, kimchi exports in Korea did increase, but so did the production of kimchi in China and the import of Chinese kimchi into Korea.

==== 2010 Kimchi ingredient price crisis ====
Due to heavy rainfall shortening the harvesting time for cabbage and other main ingredients for kimchi in 2010, the price of kimchi ingredients and kimchi itself rose greatly. Korean and international newspapers described the rise in prices as a national crisis. Some restaurants stopped offering kimchi as a free side dish, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared to an American hamburger restaurant no longer offering free ketchup. In response to the kimchi price crisis, the South Korean government announced the temporary reduction of tariffs on imported cabbage to coincide with the kimjang season.

==== Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity ====
Kimchi-related items have been inscribed on UNESCO&#x27;s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by both South and North Korea. This makes kimchi the second intangible heritage that was submitted by two countries, the other one being the folk song &quot;Arirang&quot; which was also submitted by both the Koreas. &quot;The culture of kimjang&quot; was the subject of the Intangible Cultural Heritage: kimchi is not registered by itself.

===== Submitted by South Korea (inscribed 2013) =====
Kimjang, the tradition of making and sharing kimchi that usually takes place in late autumn, was added to the list as &quot;Gimjang, making and sharing kimchi in the Republic of Korea&quot;. The practice of Gimjang reaffirms Korean identity and strengthens family cooperation. Gimjang is also an important reminder for many Koreans that human communities need to live in harmony with nature.

===== Submitted by North Korea (inscribed 2015) =====
North Korean kimchi-making was inscribed on the list in December 2015 as &quot;Tradition of kimchi-making in the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea&quot;. North Korean kimchi tends to be less spicy and less red than South Korean kimchi. Seafood is used less often and less salt is added. Additional sugar is used to help with fermentation in the cold climate.

====Kimchi Day====

In the United States, states California, Virginia, Maryland and New York, and capital city Washington D.C. have issued proclamations declaring 22 November as &#x27;Kimchi Day&#x27; to recognize the importance of the dish as part of Korean culture.

==== 2012 effective ban by China of Korean kimchi imports ====
Since 2012, the Chinese government has effectively banned the import of Korean kimchi through government regulations. Ignoring the standards of kimchi outlined by the &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot;, China defined kimchi as a derivative of one of its own cuisines, called &quot;pao cai&quot;. However, due to significantly different preparation techniques from &quot;pao cai&quot;, kimchi has significantly more lactic acid bacteria through its fermentation process, which exceeds China&#x27;s regulations. Since 2012, commercial exports of Korean kimchi to China has reached zero; the only minor amounts of exports accounting for Korean kimchi are exhibition events held in China.

==== 2017 boycott in China ====
A 2017 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that anti-Korean sentiment in China had risen after South Korea&#x27;s acceptance of the deployment of THAAD in South Korea. Government-run Chinese news media encouraged the boycott of South Korean goods, and some Chinese nationalists vowed to not eat kimchi. The move was criticized by other Chinese nationalists, who noted that China officially considered Koreans an integral ethnic group in the multinational state, and that kimchi is also indigenous to the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture.

==== 2020 kimchi ISO standard dispute with China ====
In November 2020, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) posted ISO 24220:2020, new regulations for the making of &quot;pao cai&quot;. The same month, BBC News reported that Chinese news organization &quot;Global Times&quot; claimed the new ISO standard was &quot;an international standard for the kimchi industry led by China&quot; despite the standard clearly stating &quot;this document does not apply to kimchi&quot;. This sparked strong anger from South Korean media and people, as well as the responses from some Chinese people who argued China held the right to claim kimchi as their own. 

However clarifications from both countries, later revealed that the controversy was triggered over a misunderstanding of a translation of the Chinese word &quot;pao cai&quot;. After the controversy emerged, &quot;Global Times&quot; explained it was simply a &quot;misunderstanding in translation&quot;, where they had meant to refer to Chinese &quot;pao cai&quot;, and their Chinese language article had used the term &quot;pao cai&quot;, but their English language version had &quot;erroneously&quot; translated it as &quot;kimchi&quot;, and that the dispute arose from being innocently &quot;lost in translation&quot;. They acknowledged that kimchi and &quot;pao cai&quot; are two different foods, where &quot;Kimchi refers to a kind of fermented cabbage dish that plays an integral role in Korean cuisine, while &quot;pàocài&quot;, or Sichuan &quot;pàocài&quot;, refers to pickled vegetables that are popular originally in Southwest China&#x27;s Sichuan Province, but now in most parts of northern China.&quot; &quot;Global Times&quot; also reported that Baidu Baike, a Chinese online encyclopedia, removed the controversial phrase &quot;Korean kimchi originated from China&quot; after the request. 

According to Sojin Lim, co-director of the Institute of Korean Studies of the University of Central Lancashire, Korean kimchi is often called &quot;pao cai&quot; in China, but China has its own Sichuanese fermented vegetable dish that it also calls &quot;pao cai&quot;. In 2021, the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism subsequently presented the guidelines to set the term &quot;xīnqí&quot; as the new proper Chinese translation of kimchi, while &quot;pàocài&quot; was no longer the acceptable translation. However, CNN reported that the new Chinese translation of kimchi was unpopular with both Chinese and Korean netizens, and that some Chinese people complained that they do recognise the difference between dishes, but don&#x27;t like to be told how to translate Kimchi in Chinese. There were also complaints among Koreans that Korea is appropriating their own traditional culture for the Chinese, by trying to promote a Chinese term for Kimchi which doesn&#x27;t have an authentic Korean sound.

== Ingredients ==


Kimchi varieties are determined by the main vegetable ingredients and the mix of seasoning used to flavor the kimchi.

=== Vegetables ===
Cabbages (napa cabbages, bomdong, headed cabbages) and radishes (Korean radishes, ponytail radishes, gegeol radishes, yeolmu radishes) are the most commonly used kimchi vegetables. Other kimchi vegetables include: aster, balloon flower roots, burdock roots, celery, chamnamul, cilantro, cress, crown daisy greens, cucumber, eggplant, garlic chives, garlic scapes, ginger, Korean angelica-tree shoots, Korean parsley, Korean wild chive, lotus roots, mustard greens, onions, perilla leaves, bamboo shoot, momordica charantia, pumpkins, radish greens, rapeseed leaves, scallions, seaweed, soybean sprouts, spinach, sugar beets, sweet potato vines, and tomatoes.

=== Seasonings ===
Brining salt (with a larger grain size compared to kitchen salt) is used mainly for initial salting of kimchi vegetables. Being minimally processed, it serves to help develop flavors in fermented foods. Cabbage is usually salted twice when making spicy kimchi.

Commonly used seasonings include &quot;gochugaru&quot; (chili powder), scallions, garlic, ginger, and &quot;jeotgal&quot; (salted seafood) &quot;Jeotgal&quot; can be replaced with raw seafood in colder Northern parts of the Korean peninsula. If used, milder &quot;saeu-jeot&quot; (salted shrimp) or &quot;jogi-jeot&quot; (salted croaker) is preferred and the amount of &quot;jeotgal&quot; is also reduced in Northern and Central regions. In Southern Korea, on the other hand, a generous amount of stronger &quot;myeolchi-jeot&quot; (salted anchovies) and &quot;galchi-jeot&quot; (salted hairtail) is commonly used. Raw seafood or &quot;daegu-agami-jeot&quot; (salted cod gills) are used in the East coast areas.

Salt, scallions, garlic, fish sauce, and sugar are commonly added to flavor the kimchi.

==Production==
To make kimchi, start by slicing cabbage or daikon into small, uniform pieces to increase surface area. The pieces are then coated with salt to draw out water, which helps preserve them by preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. This salting process can use 5–7% salt for 12 hours or 15% salt for 3–7 hours.

After salting, drain the excess water and mix in seasoning ingredients. Adding sugar can also help by binding any remaining water. Finally, pack the brined vegetables into an airtight jar and let them ferment at room temperature for 24 to 48 hours. The ideal salt concentration during fermentation is about 3%.

Since the fermentation process results in the production of carbon dioxide, the jar should be &quot;burped&quot; daily to release the gas. The more fermentation that occurs, the more carbon dioxide will be incorporated, which results in a very carbonated-drink-like effect.

=== Microorganisms in kimchi ===
The microorganisms present in kimchi include &quot;Bacillus mycoides&quot;, &quot;B. pseudomycoides&quot;, &quot;B. subtilis&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus brevis&quot;, &quot;Lb. curvatus&quot;, &quot;Lb. kimchii&quot;, &quot;Lb. parabrevis&quot;, &quot;Lb. pentosus&quot;, &quot;Lb. plantarum&quot;, &quot;Lb. sakei&quot;, &quot;Lb. spicheri&quot;, &quot;Lactococcus carnosum&quot;, &quot;Lc. gelidum&quot;, &quot;Lc. lactis&quot;, &quot;Leuconostoc carnosum&quot;, &quot;Ln. citreum&quot;, &quot;Ln. gasicomitatum&quot;, &quot;Ln. gelidum&quot;, &quot;Ln. holzapfelii&quot;, &quot;Ln. inhae&quot;, &quot;Ln. kimchii&quot;, &quot;Ln. lactis&quot;, &quot;Ln. mesenteroides&quot;, &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;, &quot;Weissella cibaria&quot;, &quot;W. confusa&quot;, &quot;W. kandleri&quot;, &quot;W. kimchii&quot;. &quot;W. koreensis&quot;, and &quot;W. soli&quot;. Archaea and yeasts, such as Saccharomyces, Candida, Pichia, and Kluyveromyces are also present in kimchi, with the latter being responsible for undesirable white colonies that sometimes form in the product as well as food spoilages and off-flavors.

In early fermentation stages, the &quot;Leuconostoc&quot; variety is found more dominantly in kimchi fermentation because of its lower acid tolerance and microaerophilic properties; the &quot;Leuconostoc&quot; variety also grows better at low salt concentrations. Throughout the fermentation process, as acidity rises, the &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Weissella&quot; variety become dominant because of their higher acid tolerance. &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; also grows better in conditions with a higher salt concentration.

These microorganisms are present due to the natural microflora provided by utilizing unsterilized food materials in the production of kimchi. The step of salting the raw materials as well as the addition of red pepper powder inhibit the pathogenic and putrefactive bacteria present in the microflora, allowing the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to flourish and become the dominant microorganism. These anaerobic microorganisms steadily increase in number during the middle stages of fermentation, and prefer to be kept at low temperatures of about 10°C, pH of 4.2-4, and remain in the presence of 1.5% – 4% NaCl. A faster fermentation at a higher temperature may be chosen as well to accelerate the growth of bacterial cultures for a faster decrease in pH level.

Since the raw cruciferous vegetables themselves are the source of LAB required for fermentation, no starter culture is required for the production of kimchi; rather, spontaneous fermentation occurs. The total population of microorganisms present at the beginning of processing determine the outcome of fermentation, causing the final product to be highly variable in terms of quality and flavor. Currently, there are no recommended approaches to control the microbial community during fermentation to predict the outcome. In the industrial production of kimchi, starter cultures made up of &quot;Leu. mesenteroides&quot;, &quot;Leu. citreum&quot;, and &quot;Lb. plantarum&quot; are used, which are often unsuccessful because they fail to outcompete the naturally occurring cultures on the raw materials.

=== By-products of microorganisms ===
The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and carbon dioxide as by-products during metabolism. Lactic acid quickly lowers the pH, creating an acidic environment that is uninhabitable for most other microorganisms that survived salting. This also modifies the flavor of sub-ingredients and can increase the nutritive value of the raw materials, as the microbial community in the fermentation process can synthesize B vitamins and hydrolyze cellulose in plant tissues to free nutrients that are normally indigestible by the human gastrointestinal tract. Hydrogen peroxide is formed by the oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and provides an antibiotic to inhibit some undesirable microorganisms. Carbon dioxide functions as a preservative, flushing out oxygen to create an anaerobic environment, as well as creating the desired carbonation in the final product.

=== Odor ===
Kimchi is known for its strong, spicy, flavors and odors, although milder varieties exist. Variations in the fermentation process cause the final product to be highly variable in terms of quality and flavor. The strong odor is especially tied to the sulfur compounds from garlic and ginger of kimchi, which can be less appealing to non-Koreans. Thus, scientists are experimenting with the types of bacteria used in its production to minimize the odor to increase the appeal for international markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fifield_6/22/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts are not universally appreciated by lovers of kimchi, as the flavor is affected in the process, and some see that &quot;South Korea&#x27;s narrative about its own culinary staple&quot; is being manipulated to suit the foreigners&#x27; tastes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herreria_Russo_6/29/2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==

Kimchi is one of the most important staples of Korean cuisine. The Korean term &quot;Kimchi&quot; refers to fermented vegetables, and encompasses salt and seasoned vegetables. It is mainly served as a side dish with every meal, but also can be served as a main dish. Kimchi is mainly recognized as a spicy fermented cabbage dish globally. 

New variations of kimchi continue to be created, and the taste can vary depending on the region and season. Conventionally, the secret of kimchi preparation was passed down by mothers to their daughters in a bid to make them suitable wives to their husbands. However, with the current technological advancement and increase in social media use, many individuals worldwide can now access recipes for kimchi preparation.

Kimchi can be categorized by main ingredients, regions or seasons. Korea&#x27;s northern and southern sections have a considerable temperature difference. There are over 180 recognized varieties of kimchi. The most common kimchi variations are:
* &quot;Baechu-kimchi&quot; () spicy napa cabbage kimchi, made from whole cabbage leaves
* &quot;Baechu-geotjeori&quot; () unfermented napa cabbage kimchi
* &quot;Bossam-kimchi&quot; () wrapped kimchi
* &quot;Baek-kimchi&quot; () white kimchi, made without chili pepper
* &quot;Dongchimi&quot; () a non-spicy watery kimchi
* &quot;Nabak-kimchi&quot; () a mildly spicy watery kimchi
* &quot;Chonggak-kimchi&quot; () cubed chonggak &quot;ponytail&quot; radish, a popular spicy kimchi
* &quot;Kkakdugi&quot; () spicy cubed Korean radish strongly-scented kimchi containing fermented shrimp
* &quot;Oi-sobagi&quot; () cucumber kimchi that can be stuffed with seafood and chili paste, and is a popular choice during the spring and summer seasons
* &quot;Pa-kimchi&quot; () spicy green onion kimchi
* &quot;Yeolmu-kimchi&quot; () is also a popular choice during the spring and summer, and is made with yeolmu radishes, and does not necessarily have to be fermented.
* &quot;Gat-kimchi&quot; (), made with Indian mustard
* &quot;Yangbaechu-kimchi&quot; (양배추 김치) spicy cabbage kimchi, made from &quot;headed&quot; cabbage leaves (as opposed to napa cabbage)

Kimchi from the northern parts of Korea tends to have less salt and red chili and usually does not include brined seafood for seasoning. Northern kimchi often has a watery consistency. Kimchi made in the southern parts of Korea, such as Jeolla Province and Gyeongsang Province, uses salt, chili peppers and &quot;myeolchijeot&quot; (, brined anchovy allowed to ferment) or &quot;saeujeot&quot; (, brined shrimp allowed to ferment), &quot;myeolchiaekjeot&quot; (), anchovy fish sauce, &quot;kkanariaekjeot&quot; (), liquid anchovy jeot, similar to fish sauce used in Southeast Asia, but thicker.

&quot;Saeujeot&quot; () or &quot;myeolchijeot&quot; is not added to the kimchi spice-seasoning mixture, but is simmered first to reduce odors, eliminate tannic flavor and fats, and then is mixed with a thickener made of rice or wheat starch (). This technique has been falling into disuse in the past 40 years.

=== Color ===
White kimchi is neither red nor spicy. It includes white napa cabbage kimchi and other varieties such as white radish kimchi (&quot;dongchimi&quot;). Watery white kimchi varieties are sometimes used as an ingredient in a number of dishes such as cold noodles in &quot;dongchimi&quot; brine (&quot;dongchimi-guksu&quot;).

=== Age ===
* &quot;Geotjeori&quot; (): fresh, unfermented kimchi.
* &quot;Mugeun-ji&quot; (), also known as &quot;mugeun-kimchi&quot; (): aged kimchi

===Region===

The following regional classification dates to the 1960s. Since then, kimchi-making practices and trends in Korea have diverged from it.
* Pyongan Province Non-traditional ingredients have been adopted in rural areas due to severe food shortages.
* Hamgyong Province: Due to its proximity to the ocean, people in this particular region use fresh fish and oysters to season their kimchi.
* Hwanghae Province: The taste of kimchi in Hwanghae Province is not bland but not extremely spicy. Most kimchi from this region has less color since red chili flakes are not used. The typical kimchi for Hwanghae Province is called hobakji (호박지). It is made with pumpkin (&quot;bundi&quot;).
* Gyeonggi Province
* Chungcheong Province: Instead of using fermented fish, people in the region rely on salt and fermentation to make savory kimchi. Chungcheong Province has the most varieties of kimchi.
* Gangwon Province, South Korea&quot;/&quot;Kangwon Province, North Korea: In Gangwon Province, kimchi is stored for longer periods. Unlike other coastal regions in Korea, kimchi in this area does not contain much salted fish.
* Jeolla Province: Salted yellow corvina and salted butterfish are used in this region to create different seasonings for kimchi.
* Gyeongsang Province: This region&#x27;s cuisine is saltier and spicier. The most common seasoning components include myeolchijeot () which produce a briny and savory flavor. They also use oysters in their kimchi.
* Foreign countries: In some places of the world people sometimes make kimchi with western cabbage and many other alternative ingredients such as broccoli.

===Seasonal variations===
Different types of kimchi were traditionally made at different times of the year, based on when various vegetables were in season and also to take advantage of hot and cold seasons before the era of refrigeration. Although the advent of modern refrigeration – including kimchi refrigerators specifically designed with precise controls to keep different varieties of kimchi at optimal temperatures at various stages of fermentation – has made this seasonality unnecessary, Koreans continue to consume kimchi according to traditional seasonal preferences.

====Spring====
After a long period of consuming &quot;gimjang kimchi&quot; () during the winter, fresh potherbs and vegetables were used to make kimchi. These kinds of kimchi were not fermented or even stored for long periods of time but were consumed fresh.

====Summer====

Yeolmu radishes and cucumbers are summer vegetables made into kimchi, &quot;yeolmu-kimchi&quot; () which is eaten in several bites. Brined fish or shellfish can be added, and freshly ground dried chili peppers are often used.

====Autumn====
&quot;Baechu kimchi&quot; is prepared by inserting blended stuffing materials, called &quot;sok&quot; (literally &quot;inside&quot;), between layers of salted leaves of uncut, whole Napa cabbage. The ingredients of &quot;sok&quot; () can vary, depending on the regions and weather conditions. Generally, &quot;baechu kimchi&quot; used to have a strong salty flavor until the late 1960s, before which a large amount of &quot;myeolchijeot&quot; or &quot;saeujeot&quot; had been used.

&quot;Gogumasoon Kimchi&quot; is made from sweet potato stems.
====Winter====
Traditionally, the greatest varieties of kimchi were available during the winter. In preparation for the long winter months, many types of kimjang kimchi () were prepared in early winter and stored in the ground in large kimchi pots. Today, many city residents use modern kimchi refrigerators offering precise temperature controls to store kimjang kimchi. November and December are traditionally when people begin to make kimchi; women often gather together in each other&#x27;s homes to help with winter kimchi preparations. &quot;Baechu kimchi&quot; is made with salted baechu filled with thin strips of radish, parsley, pine nuts, pears, chestnuts, shredded red pepper, manna lichen (), garlic, and ginger.

===Korean preference===
As of 2004, the preference of kimchi preparation in Korean households from the most prepared type of kimchi to less prepared types of kimchi was: &quot;baechu&quot; kimchi, being the most prepared type of kimchi, then &quot;kkakdugi&quot;, then &quot;dongchimi&quot; and then &quot;chonggak&quot; kimchi. &quot;Baechu&quot; kimchi comprised more than seventy percent of marketed kimchi and radish kimchi comprised about twenty percent of marketed kimchi.

==Nutrition==

Kimchi is made of various vegetables and contains a high concentration of dietary fiber, while being low in food energy. The vegetables used in kimchi also contribute to intake of vitamin A, thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), calcium, and iron.


A 2003 article said that South Koreans consume 18kg (40lbs) of kimchi per person annually. Many credit the Korean Miracle in part to eating the dish. Adult Koreans eat from to of kimchi a day.

==Trade==
South Korea spent around $129 million in 2017 to purchase 275,000 metric tons of foreign kimchi, more than 11 times the amount it exported, according to data released by the Korea Customs Service in 2017. South Korea consumes 1.85 million metric tons of kimchi annually, or 36.1 kg per person. It imports a significant fraction of that, mostly from China, and runs a $47.3 million kimchi trade deficit.

== Consumption ==
In 2021, Koreans collectively consumed 1,965,000 tons of Kimchi, with average Korean consuming 88.3 grams of Kimchi daily. This average has been steadily declining from 109.9 grams per day in 2010, marking a 19.6% decrease. Males tend to consume more Kimchi than females, with an average of 106.6 grams compared to 70.0 grams.
== Food regulations ==
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has regulations for the commercial production of kimchi. The final product should have a pH ranging from 4.2 to 4.5. Any low-acidity ingredients with a pH above 4.6, including white daikon and napa cabbage, should not be left under conditions that enable the growth of undesirable microorganisms and require a written illustration of the procedure designed to ensure this is available if requested. This procedural design should include steps that maintain sterility of the equipment and products used, and the details of all sterilization processes. The cutoff pH of 4.6 is a value common to many food safety regulations, initially defined because botulism toxin is not produced below this level.

<text>Tree-kangaroos are marsupials of the genus Dendrolagus, adapted for arboreal locomotion. They inhabit the tropical rainforests of New Guinea and far northeastern Queensland, Australia along with some of the islands in the region. All tree-kangaroos are considered threatened due to hunting and habitat destruction. They are the only true arboreal macropods.

==Evolutionary history==
The evolutionary history of tree-kangaroos possibly begins with a rainforest floor-dwelling pademelon-like ancestor. This ancestor possibly evolved from an arboreal possum-like ancestor as is suspected of all macropodid marsupials in Australia and New Guinea. During the late Eocene, the Australian/New Guinean continent began a period of drying that caused a retreat in the area of rainforest, which forced the ancestral pademelons to begin living in a drier, rockier environment. After some generations of adaptation to the new environment, the pademelons may have evolved into rock-wallabies (&quot;Petrogale&quot; spp.), which developed a generalist feeding strategy due to their dependence on a diverse assortment of vegetation refuges. This generalist strategy allowed the rock-wallabies to easily adapt to Malesian rainforest types that were introduced to Australia from Asia during the mid-Miocene. The rock-wallabies that migrated into these introduced forests adapted to spend more time climbing trees. One species in particular, the Proserpine rock-wallaby (&quot;Petrogale persephone&quot;), displays equal preference for climbing trees as for living in rocky outcrops. During the Late Miocene, the semi-arboreal rock-wallabies could have evolved into the now extinct tree-kangaroo genus &quot;Bohra&quot;. Global cooling during the Pleistocene caused continent-wide drying and rainforest retractions in Australia and New Guinea.

The rainforest contractions isolated populations of &quot;Bohra&quot; which resulted in the evolution of today&#x27;s tree-kangaroos (&quot;Dendrolagus&quot; spp.), as they adapted to lifestyles in geographically small and diverse rainforest fragments, and became further specialized for a canopy-dwelling lifestyle.

==Taxonomy==

===Species===

These species are assigned to the genus &quot;Dendrolagus&quot;:
Seri&#x27;s tree-kangaroo (&quot;Dendrolagus stellarum&quot;) has been described as a subspecies of Doria&#x27;s tree-kangaroo (&quot;D. dorianus stellarum&quot;), but some recent authorities have treated it as a separate species based on its absolute diagnostability.

The Wondiwoi tree-kangaroo is among the 25 &quot;most wanted lost&quot; species that are the focus of Global Wildlife Conservation&#x27;s &quot;Search for Lost Species&quot; initiative.

The extinct species &quot;D. noibano&quot; from the Pleistocene of Chimbu Province, Papua New Guinea is substantially larger than living species. However, it has since been suggested to be a larger extinct form of Doria&#x27;s tree-kangaroo.

The case for the golden-mantled tree-kangaroo (&quot;D. pulcherrimus&quot;) is comparable to that of &quot;D. stellarum&quot;; it was first described as a subspecies of &quot;D. goodfellowi&quot;, though recent authorities have elevated it to species status based on its absolute diagnostability. A population of the tenkile (Scott&#x27;s tree-kangaroo) recently discovered from the Bewani Mountains may represent an undescribed subspecies.

==Distribution and habitat==
Tree-kangaroos inhabit the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Australia, and some of the islands in the region, in particular, the Schouten Islands and the Raja Ampat Islands. Although most species are found in mountainous areas, several also occur in lowlands, such as the aptly named lowlands tree-kangaroo. Most tree-kangaroos are considered threatened due to hunting and habitat destruction. Because much of their lifestyle involves climbing and jumping between trees, they have evolved an appropriate method of locomotion. Tree-kangaroos thrive in the treetops, as opposed to terrestrial kangaroos which survive on mainland Australia. Two species of tree-kangaroos are found in Australia, Bennett&#x27;s (&quot;D. bennetianus&quot;), which is found north of the Daintree River and Lumholtz&#x27;s (&quot;D. lumholtzi&quot;). Tree-kangaroos have adapted better to regions of high altitudes. Tree-kangaroos must find places comfortable and well-adapted for breeding, as they only give birth to one joey per year. They are known to have one of the most relaxed and leisurely birthing seasons. They breed cautiously in the treetops during the monsoon season. Their habitats are breeding grounds for danger, as they can easily fall prey to their natural predator, the amethystine python, which also climbs and lives in the treetops. Tree-kangaroos are known to be able to live in both mountainous regions and lowland locations.

==Description==
Lumholtz&#x27;s tree-kangaroo is the smallest of all tree-kangaroos. Its body and head length ranges about , and its tail, , with males weighing an average of 7.2 kg (16 lb) and females 5.9 kg (13 lb). The length of Doria&#x27;s tree-kangaroo is , with a long tail, and weighs . Matschie&#x27;s tree-kangaroo has a body and head length of 81 cm (20 to 32 inches), adult males weigh 9–11 kg (20-25 lb) and adult females weigh 7–9 kg (15-20 lb). The grizzled tree-kangaroo grows to a length of 75–90 cm (30 to 35 in), with males being considerably larger than females, and its weight is 8–15 kg (18-33 lb).

Tree-kangaroos have several adaptations to an arboreal life-style. Compared to terrestrial kangaroos, tree-kangaroos have longer and broader hind feet with longer, curved nails. They also have a sponge-like grip on their paws and soles of their feet. Tree-kangaroos have a much larger and more pendulous tail than terrestrial kangaroos, giving them enhanced balance while moving about the trees. Locomotion on the ground is by hopping, as with true kangaroos. Like terrestrial kangaroos, tree-kangaroos do not sweat to cool their bodies, rather, they lick their forearms and allow the moisture to evaporate in an adaptive form of behavioural thermoregulation.

==Behaviour==

===Locomotion===
Tree-kangaroos are slow and clumsy on the ground. They move at approximately human walking pace and hop awkwardly, leaning their body far forward to balance the heavy tail. However, in trees, they are bold and agile. They climb by wrapping their forelimbs around the trunk of a tree and, while allowing the forelimbs to slide, hop up the tree using their powerful hind legs. They are expert leapers; downward jumps from one tree to another have been recorded and they have the extraordinary ability to jump to the ground from or more without being hurt.

===Diet===
The main diet of the tree-kangaroo is leaves and fruit that it gathers from the trees, but occasionally scavenged from the ground. Tree-kangaroos will also eat grains, flowers, various nuts, sap and tree bark. Some captive tree-kangaroos (perhaps limited to New Guinea species) eat protein foods such as eggs, birds and snakes, making them omnivores.

===Reproduction===
Little is known about the reproduction of tree-kangaroos in the wild. The only published data are from captive individuals. Female tree-kangaroos reach sexual maturity as early as 2.04 years of age and males at 4.6 years. The female&#x27;s fertile period is estimated to be approximately two months. They have one of the longest marsupial offspring development/maturation periods; pouch life for the young is 246–275 days long and weaning occurs 87–240 days later.

==Threats==
The two most significant threats to tree-kangaroos are habitat loss and hunting. Tree-kangaroo habitats are being destroyed or replaced by logging and timber production, along with coffee, rice and wheat production. This habitat loss can make tree-kangaroos more exposed to predators, such as feral domestic dogs. Being hunted by local community members also contributes markedly to the declines in tree-kangaroo populations. Research conducted on Lumholtz&#x27;s tree-kangaroo, a species that dwells in the rain forests of northeastern Australia, determined the frequency of causes of death. This showed that of 27 deceased tree-kangaroos, 11 had been killed by vehicles, six by dogs, four by parasites and the remaining six died from other causes.

==Captivity==

As of 2021 five of the species are held in captivity. These include populations of Goodfellow&#x27;s (&quot;D. goodfellowi&quot;) and Matschie&#x27;s (&quot;D. matschiei&quot;), with smaller numbers of Lumholtz&#x27;s (&quot;D. lumholtzi&quot;), Grizzled (&quot;D. inustus&quot;), and Doria&#x27;s (&quot;D. dorianus&quot;) tree kangaroos. These are being kept in a variety of facilities across North America, Oceania, and Europe, with smaller holdings in Asia. The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums coordinates with regional zoological associations to ensure the coordination of breeding programs to maintain viable breeding populations and genetic diversity outside of the wild populations.

In November 2014 at the Adelaide Zoo, an orphaned tree-kangaroo joey was transferred to the pouch of a yellow-footed rock-wallaby when his mother was killed by a falling branch. The joey survived, having been successfully reared by the surrogate mother rock-wallaby.

On April 29, 2022, the Bronx Zoo announced the birth of a Matschie&#x27;s tree kangaroo joey, the first of its species born at the zoo since 2008. The joey was the size of a human thumbnail at birth.

<text>The Kruithof curve describes a region of illuminance levels and color temperatures that are often viewed as comfortable or pleasing to an observer. The curve was constructed from psychophysical data collected by Dutch physicist Arie Andries Kruithof, though the original experimental data is not present on the curve itself. Lighting conditions within the bounded region were empirically assessed as being pleasing or natural, whereas conditions outside the region were considered uncomfortable, displeasing or unnatural. The Kruithof curve is a sufficient model for describing sources that are considered natural or closely resemble Planckian black bodies, but its value in describing human preference has been consistently questioned by further studies on interior lighting.

For example, natural daylight has a color temperature of 6500 K and an illuminance of about 104 to 105 lux. This color temperature–illuminance pair results in natural color rendition, but if viewed at a low illuminance, would appear bluish. At typical indoor office illuminance levels of about 400 lux, pleasing color temperatures are lower (between 3000 and 6000 K), and at typical home illuminance levels of about 75 lux, pleasing color temperatures are even lower (between 2400 and 2700 K). These color temperature-illuminance pairs are often achieved with fluorescent and incandescent sources, respectively. The pleasing region of the curve contains color temperatures and illuminance levels comparable to naturally lit environments.

==History==
At the emergence of fluorescent lighting in 1941, Kruithof conducted psychophysical experiments to provide a technical guide to design artificial lighting. Using gas-discharge fluorescent lamps, Kruithof was able to manipulate the color of emitted light and ask observers to report as to whether or not the source was pleasing to them. The sketch of his curve as presented consists of three major regions: the middle region, which corresponds to light sources considered pleasing; the lower region, which corresponds to colors that are considered cold and dim; and the upper region, which corresponds to colors that are warm and unnaturally colorful. These regions, while approximate, are still used to determine appropriate lighting configurations for homes or offices.

==Perception and adaptation==

Kruithof&#x27;s findings are directly related to human adaptation to changes in illumination. As illuminance decreases, human sensitivity to blue light increases. This is known as the Purkinje effect. The human visual system switches from photopic (cone-dominated) vision to scotopic (rod-dominated) vision when luminance levels decrease. Rods have a very high spectral sensitivity to blue energy, whereas cones have varying spectral sensitivities to reds, greens and blues. Since the dominating photoreceptor in scotopic vision is most sensitive to blue, human sensitivity to blue light is therefore increased. Because of this, intense sources of higher (bluer) color temperatures are all generally considered to be displeasing at low luminance levels, and a narrow range of pleasing sources exist. Subsequently, the range of pleasing sources increases in photopic vision as luminance levels are increased.

==Criticism==
While the curve has been used as a guide to design artificial lighting for indoor spaces, with the general suggestion to use sources with low correlated color temperatures (CCT) at low illuminances, Kruithof did not describe the method of evaluation, the independent variables, nor the test sample that were used to develop the curve. Without these data, nor other validation, the conclusions should not be considered credible. The relationship between illuminance and CCT was not supported by subsequent work.

Illuminance and CCT has been examined in many studies of interior lighting and these studies consistently demonstrate a different relationship to that suggested by Kruithof. Rather than having upper and lower boundaries, these studies do not suggest CCT to have significant effect and for illuminance suggest only to avoid levels below 300 lux. Current studies have not explored the main critical part that is the low illumination regime or the low CCT range beneath 3000K in general, though some of the studies above reached down to 2850K. This lacunae in the data is particularly important as it relates to almost all &quot;lifestyle&quot; environments in which lighting designers operate - hotels, restaurants and residential settings. Further evaluation of these areas would serve well, given the implications for recent learning on the health implications of light on the circadian rhythm.

==Further studies==
The Kruithof curve, as presented, does not contain experimental data points and serves as an approximation for desirable lighting conditions. Therefore, its scientific accuracy has been reassessed.

Color rendering index is a metric for describing the appearance of a source and whether or not it is considered pleasing. The color rendering index of a given source is a measure of that source&#x27;s ability to faithfully reproduce colors of an object. Light sources, like candles or incandescent light bulbs produce spectrums of electromagnetic energy that closely resemble Planckian black bodies; they look much like natural sources. Many fluorescent lamps or LED light bulbs have spectrums that do not match those of Planckian blackbodies and are considered unnatural. Therefore, the way that they render the perceived colors of an environment may be also considered unnatural. While these newer sources can still achieve correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels that are within the comfortable region of the Kruithof curve, variability in their color rendering indices may cause these sources to ultimately be displeasing.

Different activities or scenarios call for different color temperature–illuminance pairs: preferred light sources change depending on the scenario the source is illuminating. Individuals did prefer color temperature–illuminance pairs within the comfortable region for dining, socializing and studying, but also preferred color temperature–illuminance pairs that were in the lower uncomfortable region for night time activities and preparing for bed. This is linked to the Purkinje effect; individuals who desire some light at night time desire lower (redder) color temperatures even if luminance levels are very low.

Kruithof&#x27;s findings may also vary as a function of culture or geographic location. Desirable sources are based on an individual&#x27;s previous experiences of perceiving color, and as different regions of the world may have their own lighting standards, each culture would likely have its own acceptable light sources.

The illuminance of a source is the dominating factor for deciding as to whether or not a source is pleasing or comfortable, as viewers participating in this experiment evaluated a range of correlated color temperatures and illuminance levels, yet their impressions remained generally unchanged as correlated color temperature changed. Additionally, there is a relationship between correlated color temperature and apparent brightness of a source. From these findings, it is evident that color rendering index, in place of correlated color temperature, may be a more appropriate metric for determining as to whether or not a certain source is considered pleasing.

<text>Simon Findlay Crean (26 February 1949 – 25 June 2023) was an Australian politician and trade unionist. He was the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and leader of the opposition from 2001 to 2003. He represented the seat of Hotham in the House of Representatives from 1990 to 2013 and was a cabinet minister in the Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments.

Crean was born in Melbourne, the son of Frank Crean who was deputy prime minister under Gough Whitlam. He studied law and economics at Monash University and was involved in the trade union movement from a young age, becoming general secretary of the Storemen and Packers&#x27; Union in 1979. He was elected vice-president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in 1981 and president in 1985. Crean stood down from this role upon his election to parliament at the 1990 federal election, and was immediately appointed Minister for Science and Technology in the Hawke government. He held several other ministerial posts until Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 1996 election.

Following Labor&#x27;s 1998 election defeat, Crean was elected deputy leader of the ALP under Kim Beazley, replacing Gareth Evans. He was elected unopposed to succeed Beazley as party leader following further defeat at the 2001 election, becoming leader of the opposition. Despite initial enthusiasm for his leadership, Crean struggled in opinion polling, and in June 2003 Beazley challenged him for the leadership. Although Crean won comfortably, speculation about his leadership only intensified, and in November 2003 he announced that he would resign, and was replaced by his shadow treasurer Mark Latham.

Despite losing the leadership, Crean remained a senior figure within the Labor Party, and returned to cabinet as Minister for Trade when Labor won the 2007 election. Crean supported Julia Gillard in her leadership challenge to Kevin Rudd in June 2010, and remained in the Cabinet after she was successful. Although he continued to support Gillard through the leadership spill in February 2012, in March 2013 he announced that he was switching support to Rudd, sparking another leadership spill; Gillard sacked him from the Cabinet in response. When Rudd eventually did return as prime minister at the leadership spill in June 2013, Crean ran unsuccessfully to return to the role of deputy leader; he subsequently announced his decision to retire from politics at the 2013 election.

==Early life and education==
Crean was born in Melbourne on 26 February 1949. He was one of three sons born to Mary () and Frank Crean. His father was a federal Labor MP from 1951 to 1977, who served periods as Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam government. One of his brothers, David Crean, a medical doctor, was a Member of the Tasmanian Parliament. His other brother, Stephen Crean, a public servant, died while skiing alone at Charlotte Pass, New South Wales, in 1985, aged 38; his body was not found for two years.

Crean grew up in the inner Melbourne suburb of Middle Park. He was educated at Melbourne High School, before going on to Monash University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Economics and Bachelor of Laws.

==Trade unionist==
Following his graduation from Monash University, Crean worked in several roles with various trade unions, before becoming an official within the Storeman and Packers Union (SPU). In 1977, aged 28, he stood for ALP preselection to succeed his father in the seat of Melbourne Ports, widely considered a safe Labor seat. He was defeated for preselection by former ALP state leader Clyde Holding, with Holding winning the ballot by 36 votes to 34.

In 1979, Crean was elected General Secretary of the SPU, which entitled him to a seat on the board of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). He was elected ACTU vice-president in 1981, before in 1985 winning election as ACTU president. In this position, he played a key role in negotiating numerous agreements on wages and other industrial issues as part of the Prices and Incomes Accord with the Government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke, himself a former ACTU president.

As ACTU president, Crean served on the board of Qantas from 1987 to 1990 and on the board of the Australian Industry Development Corporation from 1988 to 1990.

==Political career==
===Hawke and Keating governments===

Ahead of the 1990 election, Crean was easily selected as the Labor candidate for the safe seat of Hotham; he was elected to Parliament on 24 March, and immediately entered the Cabinet as Minister for Science and Technology. He became Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in 1991, retaining this job when Paul Keating replaced Bob Hawke as prime minister in December 1991. After Labor&#x27;s victory at the 1993 election, Keating moved Crean to become Minister for Employment, Education and Training, a role he held until 1996.

===Opposition===
After the Labor Party was heavily defeated at the 1996 election, Crean chose to contest the deputy leadership, but was defeated by Gareth Evans by 42 votes to 37. He joined the Shadow Cabinet, and after Evans retired from politics following Labor&#x27;s 1998 election defeat, Crean was easily elected to replace him, becoming Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Treasurer. In January 2001, Crean was awarded the Centenary Medal.

In November 2001, following Labor&#x27;s third consecutive election defeat, Crean was elected unopposed to replace Kim Beazley as Leader of the Labor Party, becoming leader of the opposition; Jenny Macklin was elected as his deputy, also unopposed. On 4 February 2003, Crean led the Labor Party to condemn Prime Minister John Howard&#x27;s decision to commit Australian troops to the Iraq War.

Throughout most of 2003, poor opinion polling led to speculation of a leadership challenge against Crean; on 16 June 2003, Crean called a leadership spill intending to put an end to the leadership tensions, winning against Kim Beazley by 58 votes to 34. This failed to stop Crean losing even further ground to Howard in opinion polls as preferred Prime Minister, and on 28 November 2003, Crean announced that he would resign as Leader of the Labor Party, stating that he felt he no longer had the confidence of his colleagues; this made him the first Labor Leader not to contest a federal election since 1916. On 2 December, Shadow Treasurer Mark Latham defeated Kim Beazley in a ballot by 47 votes to 45 to replace Crean; Latham appointed Crean immediately as Shadow Treasurer. After Labor suffered a fourth consecutive defeat at the 2004 election, Crean resigned from his Shadow Treasurer position; he initially intended to resign from the Shadow Cabinet entirely, but at Latham&#x27;s insistence, he accepted the role of Shadow Minister for Trade.

Crean retained this position when Beazley returned to the leadership in January 2005. However, in a reshuffle of the Shadow Cabinet in June 2005, Crean was demoted to Shadow Minister for Regional Development. He then faced a pre-selection challenge for his seat of Hotham from Martin Pakula, a member of his former union, the SPU, a move which Crean publicly blamed on Beazley, Hong Lim, and the Labor Right. Beazley refused to publicly support either candidate, but several frontbenchers, including Julia Gillard, supported Crean. This helped Crean to comfortably win the pre-selection for his seat; Crean singled out Senator Stephen Conroy for his part in the move against him, describing his front-bench colleague as &quot;venal&quot; and &quot;one of the most disloyal people I&#x27;ve ever worked with in my life&quot;. Following the replacement of Kim Beazley by Kevin Rudd as leader in December 2006, Rudd reappointed Crean as Shadow Minister for Trade.

===Rudd and Gillard governments===

After Labor&#x27;s victory at the 2007 election, new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appointed Crean to the Cabinet as Minister for Trade. In this role, Crean visited Singapore and Vietnam to pursue Australia&#x27;s trade and economic interests at a range of ministerial and other high-level meetings. Crean also attended the APEC Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Trade and the OECD Roundtable on Sustainable Development on behalf of the Australian Government. Crean also co-chaired the 8th Joint Trade and Economic Cooperation Committee with the Vietnamese Minister of Planning and Investment Võ Hồng Phúc in Hanoi, leading to an improvement in the trading relationship between Australia and Vietnam.

Following Julia Gillard&#x27;s election unopposed as Prime Minister in June 2010, Crean was appointed to replace Gillard in the role of Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, with Stephen Smith taking over as Minister for Trade. After the 2010 election, Gillard reshuffled the Cabinet and appointed Crean as Minister for the Arts and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government.

On 21 March 2013, following significant leadership tensions arising from poor opinion polling, Crean called for Gillard to spill the leadership, with the aim of encouraging Rudd to challenge for the position of Prime Minister. This marked a change in Crean&#x27;s position; he had long been a committed supporter of Gillard. Crean said he would challenge Wayne Swan for the role of deputy leader, if Rudd ran for the leadership. However, Rudd declined to run, leaving Gillard to retain the leadership unopposed. Gillard quickly sacked Crean from the Cabinet, expressing publicly her disappointment at his &quot;disloyalty&quot; to her. Crean became the first Labor minister to be sacked with a dismissal letter from the Governor General since Jim Cairns in 1975.

Before his sacking, Crean had been one of the few federal politicians to have never spent time on the backbench. After Rudd did eventually replace Gillard as prime minister in June 2013, Crean ran for the position of Deputy Leader but was defeated by Anthony Albanese by 61 votes to 38. Crean subsequently announced he would retire from politics at the 2013 election.

Crean retired as the first person to serve as a Cabinet Minister under four Labor Prime Ministers (Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard) since Jack Beasley (who served under James Scullin, John Curtin, Frank Forde and Ben Chifley).

== Career after politics ==
In October 2014, Crean was elected chairman of the Australian Livestock Exporters Council. He was re-elected for a second term in 2016.

Crean was an associate professor at Deakin University and chaired the university&#x27;s Advanced Manufacturing Group. In 2014 Deakin University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Laws. The same year, he returned to his alma mater Monash University as a member of the University Council, serving as Deputy Chancellor from 2020 until his death in 2023.

Other positions Crean held included chair of the Australia-Korea Business Council, the Australian Livestock Exporters&#x27; Council, the European Australian Business Council and co-chair of Cornerstone Group Advisory Board.
Crean was also a director on the boards of Linfox and Melbourne&#x27;s Luna Park.

Crean was posthumously appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the 2024 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

== Personal life ==
Crean was married to Carole for 50 years and they had two children. He was a supporter and patron of the North Melbourne Football Club.

Crean died from a pulmonary embolism in Berlin, on 25 June 2023, while visiting Germany as part of an industry delegation as head of the European Australian Business Council. He was 74. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called him &quot;a giant of the Labor movement&quot;. He confirmed Crean would be given a state funeral.

<doc id="178966" wikidata="Q5883354" url="?curid=178966" title="Holme-next-the-Sea">
<text>Holme-next-the-Sea is a small village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is situated on the west Norfolk coast. It is north-east of Hunstanton, north of King&#x27;s Lynn and north-west of Norwich.

The village&#x27;s name means &#x27;Island&#x27; next to the sea.

The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 322 in 177 households, falling to 239 at the 2011 Census. For local government, the parish falls within the district of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk.

Its position on the North Sea coast makes it a prime site for migratory birds in autumn. It consequently is home to two adjoining nature reserves, one owned by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust and the other by the Norfolk Ornithological Association. A pair of black-winged stilts bred at the Wildlife Trust&#x27;s Holme Dunes in 1987, raising three young.

The eastern end of Hunstanton golf links reach to Holme, and public rights of way mean that birders and golfers have learned to co-exist. It is the meeting point of the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path which together form a National Trail.

It is the nearest village to Seahenge, the Bronze Age timber circle.

The parish church of St Mary was first mentioned in 1188, but the oldest remaining part of the building is the tower which dates from the fifteenth century. The main church building was demolished and rebuilt in 1888, although some memorials and an ancient stone font survive from the earlier structure. The church has a peal of five bells which are still rung, the earliest is dated 1677. In the churchyard are the graves of various members of the Nelson family, who lived at Holme House.

== Gore Point ==

Near the village is an area of beach and dunes known as “Gore Point” and is the north easternmost point of the area known as The Wash and is just by sea from Gibraltar Point (the north westernmost point) near Skegness in Lincolnshire yet by land it&#x27;s a journey of over and marks the narrowest point on The Wash between the two points of entrance into the bay.

<text>Rio Gavin Ferdinand (born 7 November 1978) is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre-back, and is now a television pundit for TNT Sports. He played 81 times for the England national team between 1997 and 2011, and was a member of three FIFA World Cup squads. He is one of the most decorated English footballers of all time, regarded by many as one of England&#x27;s greatest ever defenders.

Ferdinand began his football career playing for various youth teams, finally settling at West Ham United where he progressed through the youth ranks and made his professional Premier League debut in 1996. He became a fan favourite, winning the &quot;Hammer of the Year&quot; award the following season. He earned his first senior international cap in a match against Cameroon in 1997, setting a record as the youngest defender to play for England at the time. His achievements and footballing potential attracted Leeds United and he transferred to the club for a record-breaking fee of £18 million. He spent two seasons at the club, becoming the team captain in 2001, before he joined Manchester United in July 2002 for around £30 million, breaking the transfer fee record once more.

At Manchester United, he won the Premier League, his first major club honour, in a successful first season at the club. In September 2003, he missed a drugs test and was banned from football for eight months from January until September 2004, causing him to miss half a Premier League season, Manchester United&#x27;s FA Cup triumph, and the Euro 2004 international competition. Upon his return, he established himself in the Manchester United first team and received plaudits for his performances, featuring in the PFA Team of the Year four times in five years. More club success followed with another Premier League win in the 2006–07 season and a Premier League and UEFA Champions League double the following year. His career at United, in which he won six Premier League titles and 14 trophies, ended when his contract expired in 2014, and he subsequently joined Queens Park Rangers where he played for just one season before being released from the club as a result of their relegation from the Premier League. He announced his retirement from professional football on 30 May 2015.

In September 2017, Ferdinand announced his intention to become a professional boxer, partly to help him cope with the death of his wife. His brother, Anton, also a centre-back, last played for St Mirren. Former England international striker Les Ferdinand and former Dagenham &amp; Redbridge midfielder Kane Ferdinand are his cousins.

==Early life==
===Formative years and education===
Rio Gavin Ferdinand was born on 7 November 1978 at King&#x27;s College Hospital in Camberwell and grew up in Peckham. He is the son of an Irish mother, Janice Lavender, and an Afro-Saint Lucian father, Julian Ferdinand.

Ferdinand grew up in Peckham in a large family, his mother was one of six children and his father arrived in Britain with ten other family members. Both parents worked to support the family, his mother as a child carer and his father as a tailor. His parents never married and they separated when he was 14 years old. His father remained close, moving to a nearby estate, and took the kids to football training and to local parks. Ferdinand attended Camelot Primary School. At school, he focused on maths and revelled in the opportunity to perform before an audience during a school production of &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;.

&quot;I always as a kid wanted to do something different, I&#x27;d get bored very easily – even playing football or hanging around with my mates. So travelling away from home, meeting new people. ... I enjoyed it.&quot;

He chose to attend Blackheath Bluecoat School to make new friends and settled in well, feeling his confidence growing. His second year was marred by the death of a fellow pupil, Stephen Lawrence, and the event demonstrated the ever-present threat of violence. Ferdinand enjoyed physical expression, taking part in not just football and gymnastics classes but drama, theatre and ballet too. He was an able child: he represented Southwark in gymnastics at the London Youth Games, by age 10 he had been invited to train at the Queens Park Rangers academy, and at age 11 he won a scholarship to attend the Central School of Ballet in London. Ferdinand attended the ballet classes, travelling to the city centre four days a week for four years.

===Youth-team career===
Ferdinand&#x27;s superior footballing abilities were evident even as a child: when he was 11 years old a youth coach, David Goodwin, remarked &quot;I&#x27;m going to call you Pelé, son, I like the way you play.&quot; Ferdinand was regularly playing in youth teams and at Eltham Town he played as an attacking midfielder but team scouts saw the young player had the physical potential to be a centre-back instead. Teams vied for the young footballer&#x27;s services and during his youth he trained with Charlton Athletic, Chelsea, Millwall and Queens Park Rangers. Ferdinand was ever curious of different places and even travelled north to Middlesbrough&#x27;s training ground, spending a good part of his school holidays in a bedsit just to be there.

London team West Ham United was to be his footballing home, however, and he joined their youth system in 1992. He signed his first Youth Training Scheme contract in January 1994 and played alongside players such as Frank Lampard at the academy. Success pending at club level, international football also began for Ferdinand; at 16 he joined the England youth-team squad to compete in their age group&#x27;s UEFA European Championship, gaining his first experience of international competition.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Originally scouted by Frank Lampard, Ferdinand progressed through the youth-team ranks, earning a professional contract and a place in the first-team squad in the process. On 5 May 1996, he made his senior team debut, as he came on as a substitute for Tony Cottee in the Hammers&#x27; last game of the season, a 1–1 home draw against Sheffield Wednesday. On 1 February 1997, Ferdinand scored his first goal for West Ham, in his sixth appearance for the club, scoring in a 2–1 loss against Blackburn Rovers. In doing so, Ferndinand became the youngest player, aged 18 and 86 days, to score for West Ham in the Premier League. During the summer of 1997, Manchester United made enquires about Ferdinand before they turned to Henning Berg after West Ham rejected any sale.

During the 1997–98 season, Ferdinand won the Hammer of the Year award at the young age of 19.

====AFC Bournemouth (loan)====
In November 1996, Ferdinand joined AFC Bournemouth on loan. He made his debut on 9 November in a 1–1 away draw against Blackpool. He played 10 games for Bournemouth before returning to West Ham in January 1997.

===Leeds United===
Ferdinand joined Premier League club Leeds United in November 2000 for £18 million, then a British transfer record as well as becoming the world&#x27;s most expensive defender. Despite an uncomfortable start to his career at Elland Road, beginning with a 3–1 defeat at Leicester City on his debut, Ferdinand settled well and became an integral part of the Leeds team that reached the semi-final stage of the UEFA Champions League, scoring with a header in the quarter-final against Spain&#x27;s Deportivo La Coruña. Other highlights during his spell in Yorkshire included goals against Liverpool at Anfield and a scoring return to Upton Park.

The following season, in August 2001, he became the club captain after replacing Lucas Radebe and turned in an impressive second campaign, despite Leeds&#x27; failure to break into the top three and secure qualification for the competition they had figured in so prominently during the previous season. During the 2002 FIFA World Cup, rumours began circulating that the club were in dire financial trouble and that new manager Terry Venables would be forced to part with his star defender for a substantial amount of cash. Later that summer after Ferdinand&#x27;s impressive World Cup for England, Leeds accepted a bid of £29.3 million with possible performance related add-ons up to £33.3 million due to their perilous financial position. Years later, Rio admitted he sat in the office of Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale for almost six hours to force the transfer through.

===Manchester United===
====2002–2007====

On 22 July 2002, Ferdinand joined fellow Premier League side Manchester United on a five-year deal to become the most expensive British footballer in history at the time and the world&#x27;s most expensive defender for a second time, a title he had lost in 2001 to Lilian Thuram. Ferdinand went on to win the Premier League title with Manchester United in his first season at the club. He collected a winner&#x27;s medal in the 2006 League Cup, with runners-up medals in the 2003 League Cup and the 2005 FA Cup.

In September 2003, he failed to attend a drug test scheduled to take place at United&#x27;s Carrington training ground. Ferdinand had left after training to go shopping, only to remember and attempt to return, only to be told it was too late. He later undertook the test and passed, and also later offered to have a hair follicle test, but the FA turned down the offer. The Football Association (FA) Disciplinary Committee, chaired by Barry Bright, imposed an eight-month ban from January 2004 at club and international level and a £50,000 fine, meaning he would miss the rest of the season and some of the next along with all of Euro 2004. United appealed against the verdict and sought to draw parallels to the case of Manchester City player Christian Negouai, who was fined £2,000 for missing a test. In the end, the original verdict was upheld. In September, it was announced that he would make his return against Liverpool; Alex Ferguson praised his &quot;assuredness and composure&quot; as United won the match 2–1.

In a fixture against Charlton Athletic in May 2005, United supporters booed Ferdinand amidst his refusal to sign a new contract. Ferdinand still hadn&#x27;t signed a new contract in July and faced pressure from Ferguson to sign it, taking away his position as vice-captain. Ferdinand was booed during several pre-season friendlies in July and August, before finally signing a new four-year contract. Ferdinand later reflected on the saga, saying how he used it as motivation to change the views of United&#x27;s supporters from negative to positive.

On 14 December, in a game against Wigan Athletic, Ferdinand scored his first goal for United, en route to a 4–0 victory. He followed this later in the month with a powerfully headed goal against West Bromwich Albion. On 22 January 2006, Ferdinand scored a last minute winner against Liverpool at Old Trafford. In the corresponding fixture in the following season on 22 October, Ferdinand scored again in a 2–0 victory.

Following impressive and consistent performances in the league, Rio Ferdinand was named in the 2006–07 PFA Premiership Team of the Season, alongside seven of his Manchester United teammates.

====2007–2014====
Ferdinand started the 2007–08 season well, he was part of a United defence that managed to keep six clean sheets in a row in the Premier League, before conceding an early goal to Aston Villa at Villa Park on 20 October 2007. It was also during this game where Ferdinand scored his first goal of the season, which was United&#x27;s third goal of that game, with a left foot strike which took a very strong deflection off one of Villa&#x27;s defenders. Just three days later, Ferdinand scored his first European goal for United by opening the scoring against Dynamo Kyiv, with a superb header. United dominated the game and won 4–2.

On 12 January 2008, Ferdinand bagged a rare Premier League goal in a 6–0 hammering of Newcastle United at Old Trafford. In their FA Cup quarter-final match against Portsmouth on 8 March 2008 when Manchester United dominated, Ferdinand made a rare appearance as a goalkeeper, after Edwin van der Sar left the pitch with a groin injury and the replacement keeper, Tomasz Kuszczak, was sent off after conceding a penalty. Despite diving the right way, he was unable to save Sulley Muntari&#x27;s spot kick, and Manchester United were eliminated from the FA Cup. On 6 April 2008, against Middlesbrough, Ferdinand limped out of the match due to a foot injury. He was rated doubtful whether he would face A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg on 9 April 2008. He would play the full 90 minutes, though he received three stitches at half-time.

After United&#x27;s 2–1 loss to Chelsea in the Premier League in April 2008, Ferdinand swore at Chelsea stewards and tried to kick a wall in the tunnel, but instead kicked a female steward, Tracy Wray. Ferdinand claimed to have merely brushed her with his foot. He said he had apologised and sent the steward some flowers. However, Wray showed the bruise on her leg to the media, and her husband claimed that Ferdinand had not apologised or sent flowers.

It was announced on 18 April 2008 that, along with Michael Carrick and Wes Brown, Ferdinand had agreed to sign a new five-year contract, worth around £130,000 a week, that would keep him with United until 2013. On 21 May 2008, Ferdinand captained Manchester United to a Champions League Final victory versus Chelsea. He accepted the trophy together with Ryan Giggs, as Giggs was the on field captain for most of the matches during that season during Gary Neville&#x27;s absence due to injury.

In an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live he criticised FIFA&#x27;s approach to tackling racism in football, stating that not enough was being done to punish those guilty of homophobic or racist abuse at matches. Regarding taunts aimed at Emile Heskey in England&#x27;s 4–1 victory against Croatia in Zagreb, Ferdinand remarked:&quot;Croatia were fined a few thousand quid. What&#x27;s that going to do? That is not going to stop people shouting racist or homophobic abuse...If things like this keep happening you have to take points off them. Then the punters will realise the team is going to be punished.&quot;

Ferdinand had an injury plagued 2009–10 season, a number of back and knee injuries kept him on the sidelines for months. He returned to action on 28 January 2010, but was banned for four games after being found guilty of violent conduct for elbowing Hull City&#x27;s Craig Fagan.

Due to a knee injury he suffered in the summer of 2010, which ruled him out of the World Cup for England, he missed all of pre-season, the Community Shield and the first four games of the 2010–11 Premier League season. He returned to first-team football in the opening game of the Champions League group stage against Rangers on 14 September. He captained the side and played the full 90 minutes in a goalless draw. He started the season opening game in August 2011, the 2011 FA Community Shield, where United found themselves 2–0 down at half time to city rivals Manchester City. Ferdinand was taken off after 45 minutes along with defensive partner Nemanja Vidić and replaced by Jonny Evans and Phil Jones respectively. United went on to win the game 3–2 and Ferdinand claimed his fourth Community Shield medal of his career. Ferdinand started in the opening Premier League match of the season at West Bromwich Albion, a game United won 2–1, but he went off with a hamstring injury after 75 minutes. After the match, Alex Ferguson confirmed that Ferdinand would be out for six weeks. Ferdinand however recovered much quicker than initially diagnosed and returned to take a place on the bench two weeks later at Old Trafford in United&#x27;s 8–2 demolition of Arsenal, although he did not play a part in the game. Ferdinand made his return to competitive action in a 1–1 draw against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium.

On 9 December 2012, Ferdinand was struck and injured by a coin thrown from the home crowd during United&#x27;s 3–2 derby victory away from home against Manchester City.

On 5 March 2013, Ferdinand, unhappy with the referee Cüneyt Çakır&#x27;s decision to send off Nani during a 2–1 Champions League defeat to Real Madrid at Old Trafford, clapped sarcastically in the referee&#x27;s face after the game. He escaped any punishment from UEFA for the incident.

On 12 May 2013, Ferdinand scored the winner and final goal of the Alex Ferguson era at Old Trafford in a 2–1 victory over Swansea City. After a corner was missed by everyone, the ball found its way to Ferdinand at the back post and he hit it on the volley to seal the win. On 23 May 2013, it was announced that Ferdinand had secured a new one-year contract that would see him stay with the club until the end of the 2013–14 season. He was not offered an extension when that contract expired, and agreed to leave Manchester United on 12 May 2014. In a letter on his official website, he said &quot;I am feeling fit and healthy, ready for a new challenge and looking forward to whatever the future holds for me.&quot;

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 17 July 2014, Ferdinand signed for newly promoted Premier League club Queens Park Rangers on a one-year contract. He returned to Old Trafford for the first time since leaving Manchester United on 14 September 2014 to face his former club in the Premier League in which his side was beaten 4–0.

In October 2014, Ferdinand confirmed in an interview on &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot; that he would retire at the end of the season, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not fearful of retirement, I&#x27;m looking forward to it, I can see some good stuff hopefully happening ahead&quot;. In May 2015, following their relegation, Queens Park Rangers announced the release of Ferdinand in the summer. He made only 12 appearances for QPR in his only season with the club.

On 30 May 2015, Ferdinand announced his retirement from professional football, three days after his departure from QPR.

==International career==
Ferdinand was capped 81 times for England, making him England&#x27;s second most capped black player behind Ashley Cole with 107. Although Ferdinand was named in four consecutive England World Cup squads (albeit without playing in 1998 and missing 2010 through injury), he never went to a European Championship due to a ban for missing a drugs test and due to England&#x27;s failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008.

Ferdinand scored three goals for England, the first in the 2002 World Cup second round match against Denmark (although some sources credit this goal as a Thomas Sørensen own goal). The second was a near-post strike that beat the Russian goalkeeper Vyacheslav Malafeev in England&#x27;s Euro 2008 qualifier against Russia on 12 September 2007 at Wembley Stadium. The third on 11 October 2008 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying match at home to Kazakhstan. England won 5–1.

At the age of 19 years and 8 days, Ferdinand earned his first full England cap as a substitute in a friendly against Cameroon on 15 November 1997, making him the youngest defender to play for England at the time (a record broken in 2006 by Micah Richards). Ferdinand would have made an even earlier debut in September had he not been charged with drink-driving in the build-up to England&#x27;s 1998 World Cup qualifier against Moldova. Ferdinand was named in the squad for this game and was a likely starter; however, the public mourning for Princess Diana – whose chauffeur had been suspected of drink-driving – left Glenn Hoddle with little choice but to drop the teenager from the squad. After an impressive 1997–98 season he was selected for the 1998 FIFA World Cup squad as a back-up defender. However, he was not selected in Kevin Keegan&#x27;s 22-man squad for UEFA Euro 2000.

After his £18 million move to Leeds United, Ferdinand was named in the starting line-up by caretaker manager Peter Taylor in a friendly match against Italy and quickly established himself as a first-choice player under Sven-Göran Eriksson. He was selected as one of England&#x27;s two first-choice centre-backs at the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups, wearing the number 5 shirt.

John Terry (with whom Ferdinand would later partner in central defence) replaced Ferdinand in the England side throughout his eight-month ban until his return on 9 October 2004 in their World Cup qualifier against Wales. Ferdinand played ten World Cup finals matches for England, recording clean sheets against Argentina, Nigeria and Denmark in 2002, and Paraguay, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Ecuador and Portugal in 2006.

On 25 March 2008, it was announced that Ferdinand would wear the captain&#x27;s armband for Fabio Capello&#x27;s second game in charge of the national team, ahead of John Terry, Steven Gerrard or David Beckham, who some believed would be named captain to mark his 100th cap for his country. An FA statement suggested that the decision to name Ferdinand as captain was part of Capello&#x27;s plans of rotating the captaincy before naming an official captain for September&#x27;s World Cup qualifiers. On 19 August, however, Ferdinand lost out to Terry in retaining the captain&#x27;s armband but was named vice-captain by Fabio Capello.

A mistake in the match between England and Ukraine in Dnipropetrovsk on 10 October 2009, which led to the sending off of Robert Green, caused some to question his inclusion in the squad. A lack of match practice for his club and a series of errors such as he suffered in his early days as a footballer led to criticism of his inclusion from several corners.

On 5 February 2010, Ferdinand replaced John Terry as captain of England.

Although back and groin injury problems forced him to miss much of the 2009–10 domestic season, Ferdinand was selected to captain England at the 2010 World Cup. However, he suffered a knee ligament injury during the team&#x27;s first training session in South Africa on 4 June and was subsequently ruled out of the tournament. On 19 March 2011, ahead of England&#x27;s Euro 2012 qualifier against Wales, Capello announced that John Terry was to be re-instated as permanent England captain and that Ferdinand would return to his role of vice-captain.

Ferdinand was left out of Roy Hodgson&#x27;s squad for Euro 2012, leading to strong speculation this was to avoid potential conflict with John Terry, who was included in the squad, due to Terry&#x27;s upcoming trial for racially abusing Ferdinand&#x27;s brother Anton. Further controversy arose after Gary Cahill was ruled out of the tournament, with 22-year-old Martin Kelly with only two minutes of international football being called up as a replacement instead of Ferdinand. This led to Ferdinand&#x27;s representative Jamie Moralee accusing Hodgson of showing a &quot;lack of respect&quot;.

On 3 October 2012, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that Roy Hodgson had revealed to fellow passengers on the London Underground that Ferdinand would no longer be considered for England duty, despite the retirement of John Terry. Hodgson later apologised for these comments and denied that he was ruling Ferdinand out of playing for England again.

On 14 March 2013, Ferdinand was recalled to the England squad for the first time under Hodgson for England&#x27;s 2014 World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Montenegro, though subsequently Ferdinand pulled out of the squad on 18 March due to &#x27;fitness concerns&#x27;. Ferdinand said he was &quot;gutted&quot; at having to withdraw but said it was the &quot;right decision&quot;. However, Roy Hodgson assured Ferdinand he still had an international future despite the withdrawal.

In May 2013, Ferdinand announced his retirement from international football, saying that &quot;it&#x27;s the right time to make room for young players and focus on the club career&quot;.

==Style of play==
Ferdinand was considered an atypical defensive product of English football due to his more elegant, graceful, and &quot;continental&quot; rather than physical style of defensive play; in particular, he was singled out for his unique technical ability, skill, balance, and confidence on the ball, despite his height, as well as his composure in possession, distribution with either foot, and his ability to carry the ball forward or play it out from the back on the ground. As such, due to his mobility and ball–playing ability, he was often paired with a more physical centre-back throughout his career, such as Nemanja Vidić with Manchester United, or John Terry with England. Although he often played in a central defensive pairing in a back–four throughout his career, he was also capable of playing in the centre of a three–man back–line, in which he essentially functioned as a sweeper, courtesy of his technique and passing. Due to his ball skills, he occasionally drew criticism from pundits and his managers in his youth for taking unnecessary risks in possession, and committing mistakes, although he improved upon this aspect of the game as he matured with age and experience.

A world-class defender, who was considered to be one of the best stoppers in the world at his peak, Ferdinand is regarded as one of the best defenders of his generation, and as one of England&#x27;s, Manchester United&#x27;s, and the Premier League&#x27;s best ever centre-backs. In his prime, he was also praised for his pace, work-rate, and tackling, in addition to his positioning, consistency, intelligence, and ability to read the game. He was also an athletic and physically strong defender, who was reliable in the air, although at times he was criticised in the media for his aerial game, as well as his ability to defend high balls and set pieces, in particular in his youth. In addition to his defensive skills, he also possessed significant leadership qualities. Despite his ability, however, his later career was marked by injuries, which led him to lose the exceptional pace which had characterised him in his early career, and which previously allowed him to compensate for the occasional lapses in concentration he experienced in his youth; as such, he occasionally struggled against faster opponents with his advancing age.

==Boxing career==
In September 2017, Ferdinand announced that he was launching a career to become a professional boxer. His move into the ring was sponsored by betting company Betfair, who assisted him in attempting to qualify for his British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) licence before he began training and competing. Ferdinand stated that &quot;I&#x27;m doing this [boxing] because it&#x27;s a challenge, I&#x27;ve won titles and now I&#x27;m aiming for a belt.&quot; It was announced in May 2018 that Ferdinand had been refused a professional boxing licence by the British Boxing Board of Control. BBBofC general secretary Robert Smith told BBC Sport: &quot;There are a lot of things we take into consideration. He never had a competitive fight and although he has been in the gym, there is a difference between being in the gym and boxing. We do not deem it beneficial for him to have a licence.&quot; Following the rejection, Ferdinand announced that he was &quot;hanging-up his gloves&quot;.

==FA commission==
On 20 October 2013, Ferdinand and Roy Hodgson were appointed to the Football Association&#x27;s commission to improve the state of the national game.

==Personal life==

Ferdinand grew up in the Friary council estate, Peckham. He has several brothers and sisters: one brother and three sisters on his father&#x27;s side and a brother and sister from his mother&#x27;s remarriage. His brother, Anton Ferdinand, also played as a defender, while his cousins are Les Ferdinand and Kane Ferdinand. Although he spent the majority of his career with Manchester United, he grew up supporting rivals Liverpool.

In 2006 in Manchester, Ferdinand&#x27;s girlfriend Rebecca Ellison gave birth to their first son. The couple had two more children. In 2010, Ferdinand unsuccessfully sued the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; to prevent the publication of a story about an alleged affair with Carly Storey. During the case, it was alleged that then-England captain Ferdinand had affairs with ten different women.

Ellison and Ferdinand married in 2009. Ellison died of breast cancer on 2 May 2015, aged 34. Ferdinand&#x27;s memoir of his wife&#x27;s illness and subsequent bereavement, &quot;Thinking Out Loud&quot;, was co-written with Decca Aitkenhead, and published in October 2017. 

On 27 September 2019, Ferdinand married for the second time, to Kate Wright. The ceremony was attended by his children, along with the couple&#x27;s other close family members. In June 2020, Ferdinand and Wright announced that they were expecting their first child together. The child, a boy, was born on 18 December 2020.

Ferdinand set up the Live the Dream Foundation charity in December 2009 to provide education and employment opportunities for children.

==Politics==
Although Ferdinand has never voted before in a general election, he backed a Remain vote in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.

===Controversies===
In 2000, Ferdinand briefly appeared in a sexually explicit video filmed at the Ayia Napa resort in Cyprus along with fellow English footballers Kieron Dyer and Frank Lampard. Channel 4 aired a brief clip as part of their 2004 documentary &quot;Sex, Footballers and Videotape&quot;, claiming it was used to &quot;remind the viewer that this is based on real life&quot;.

In 2002, during the rape trial of their acquaintance Martin King, Ferdinand and former Leeds colleague Michael Duberry denied allegations that Duberry had molested the woman and Ferdinand had threatened her in the Leeds nightclub Hi-Fi on the night of 22 January, as well as further allegations of scuffling and drunkenness. Both men were interviewed by the police but the Crown Prosecution Service announced in April 2003 that they would not face charges. King was found guilty of indecent assault and attempted rape.

During a radio interview on &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; in October 2006, Ferdinand attracted two listener complaints and criticism from gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell when he called Moyles a faggot, followed by &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m sorry. I&#x27;m not homophobic&quot;, after Moyles had jokingly suggested he was homosexual. BBC Radio 1 later dismissed the exchange as banter, while Tatchell said &quot;since [he] very promptly apologised, I am happy to accept his regret and leave it at that&quot;.

In the wake of a court case involving John Terry and Rio&#x27;s brother Anton, in which Terry was found not guilty of racial abuse, Rio Ferdinand sparked media controversy by expressing amusement at the comments of a Twitter user who referred to Ashley Cole, who had testified in Terry&#x27;s favour, as a &quot;choc ice&quot;, a slang term which is commonly understood to mean &quot;black on the outside, white on the inside&quot;. Ferdinand deleted the tweet shortly afterwards and denied choc ice is a racist term, adding, &quot;And if I want to laugh at something someone tweets...I will! Hahahahaha! Now stop getting ya knickers in a twist!&quot; Cole&#x27;s lawyers released a statement in response, stating that he would not be taking the matter further. Ferdinand&#x27;s words were condemned as &quot;insensitive and untimely&quot; by Professional Footballers&#x27; Association (PFA) chief Clarke Carlisle. In August 2012, Ferdinand was fined £45,000 for his Twitter remarks after an Independent Regulatory Commission found him guilty of bringing the game into disrepute with an &quot;improper&quot; comment which included &quot;a reference to ethnic origin, colour or race.&quot;

In October 2014, Ferdinand was again charged by the FA for using offensive language on Twitter, after referring to the mother of a critic as a &quot;sket&quot;, a Jamaican slang word for a promiscuous female. Ferdinand was fined £25,000 for the offence and banned from playing for three games. The FA considered Ferdinand&#x27;s position as a &quot;role model&quot; to be an aggravating factor for the penalty, in addition to it being his second Twitter offence within three years and no admission of wrongdoing.

In March 2015, it was announced that Ferdinand would be the new face of online casino Casino Floor. The announcement provoked strong criticism on Twitter from a number of Ferdinand&#x27;s followers, who suggested it was inappropriate that a role model for young people should endorse gambling, particularly given the well documented struggles of many of his peers with problem gambling.

===Driving bans===
In September 1997, Ferdinand was convicted of drink-driving and given a one-year driving ban. He had been breathalysed after driving on the morning after a night out, and was found to be one point over the limit. As a result, England manager Glenn Hoddle dropped Ferdinand from the squad to face Moldova in a World Cup qualification match on 10 September, meaning Ferdinand lost out on the chance, at 18 years and 10 months of age, of becoming the youngest England international since Duncan Edwards.

In March 2003, Ferdinand was given another six-month ban from driving, and fined £2,500 and six penalty points for driving at an average of along the M1. In May 2005, he was criticised by a magistrate as he received his fourth ban from driving and a fine of £1,500, after being caught by traffic police &quot;travelling at an average of over a distance of nearly two miles&quot; on the M6 motorway. Upon setting the penalty, the magistrate said Ferdinand &quot;should be a positive role model for young people in society and this does not give out the right message&quot;. It followed two previous bans for speeding, in 2002 and 2003.

In August 2020, Ferdinand was banned from driving for six months after he admitted speeding on the A27 at Hangleton in Hove. Ferdinand was reported to have driven at 85 mph. He was ordered to pay a total of £822 in fines and costs.

===Order of the British Empire===
He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2022 Birthday Honours for services to association football and charity, having set up the Rio Ferdinand Foundation in 2022, a charity which works with young people and aids community development.

===Racist abuse===
In December 2023, a 33-year-old man from Staffordshire was sent to prison for six months, having been found guilty of racially abusing Ferdinand at Molineux in May 2021. Ferdinand was working there as a TV pundit for a match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester United.

==Television, punditry, film and music==

The Duran Duran song &quot;Rio&quot; has been used in football chants both for and against Ferdinand; in 2002, fan Simon Le Bon (Duran Duran&#x27;s lead singer) promised to re-record one of the football chants if the England team (featuring Ferdinand) won their World Cup quarter-final against Brazil.

Ferdinand was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo, Fabio Cannavaro, and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

In 2005, Ferdinand, along with an old school friend, created the record label White Chalk Music. To date, there are two artists signed to the label: Melody Johnston and Nia Jai. The latter released an album on 6 October 2010, which features Ferdinand rapping.

In June 2006, ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ferdinand presented the TV show &quot;Rio&#x27;s World Cup Wind-Ups&quot;, in which he carried out a series of practical jokes on his England teammates. It was broadcast immediately after England&#x27;s opening World Cup game against Paraguay.

He made his first foray into the world of cinema in late 2008, financing and becoming an executive producer of Alex de Rakoff&#x27;s film &quot;Dead Man Running&quot;. The film features Danny Dyer and 50 Cent in a gangster-themed plot. Ferdinand will share production credits with England teammate Ashley Cole.

In 2008, Ferdinand filmed a documentary about Peckham, aiming to persuade youngsters away from a life of crime.

On 16 January 2009, it was announced that he would be working with publishing company Made Up Media to launch a digital magazine. In conjunction with this, Ferdinand was guest editor of the February edition of the &quot;Observer Sport Monthly&quot;, providing interviews with people ranging from Gordon Brown to Usain Bolt. The magazine, called &quot;#5 Magazine&quot;, had its first issue published in April of that year.

In 2015, he joined BT Sport (now TNT Sports) as a pundit for their coverage of the Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.

In March 2017, Ferdinand discussed strategies for coping with bereavement in the BBC One documentary &quot;Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad&quot;. The programme won the Robert Flaherty Award for Single Documentary at the 2018 BAFTA Awards.

Released in November 2022, Ferdinand was the focus of a three-part docuseries entitled &quot;Rio Ferdinand&#x27;s Tipping Point&quot; which explored race, sexuality, and mental health in football communities.

<text>A United Nations Security Council resolution (UNSCR) is a United Nations resolution adopted by the Security Council (UNSC), the United Nations (UN) 15-member body charged with &quot;primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security&quot;.

The UN Charter specifies, in Article 27, that decisions of the Security Council shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members, out of the 15 members of the Security Council. With the exception of purely procedural decisions, all other resolutions adopted by the Security Council can be vetoed by any of the five permanent members. The five permanent members are the People&#x27;s Republic of China (which replaced the Republic of China in 1971), France, Russia (which replaced the defunct Soviet Union in 1991), the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.

Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations stipulates that &quot;The Members of the United Nations agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the present Charter&quot;. 

, the Security Council has passed 2774 resolutions.

==Terms and functions mentioned in the UN Charter==
The term &quot;resolution&quot; does not appear in the text of the United Nations Charter, which instead uses different formulations, such as &quot;decision&quot; and &quot;recommendation&quot;.

The UN Charter authorizes the Security Council to take action on behalf of all members of the United Nations, and to make decisions and recommendations. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) advisory opinion in the 1949 &quot;Reparations&quot; case indicated that the United Nations, as an Organization, had both explicit and implied powers. The Court cited Articles 104 and 2(5) of the Charter, and noted that the members had granted the Organization the necessary legal authority to exercise its functions and fulfill its purposes as specified &quot;or implied&quot; in the Charter, and that they had agreed to give the United Nations every assistance in any action taken in accordance with the Charter.

Under Article 25 of the Charter, UN member states are bound to carry out &quot;decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the present Charter&quot;.

In 1971, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) – also called the &quot;World Court&quot;, the highest court dealing with international law – asserted in an advisory opinion on the question of Namibia that all UN Security Council resolutions are legally binding. Some voices, however, defend that a difference should be made between United Nations Security Council resolutions adopted under &quot;Chapter VII&quot; of the UN Charter, which are legally binding, and those adopted under &quot;Chapter VI&quot; of the UN Charter, which are non binding; in practice, however, United Nations Security Council resolutions seldom explicit whether they are being adopted based on Chapter VI or VII of the UN Charter.

The &quot;Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs&quot;, a UN legal publication, says that during the United Nations Conference on International Organization which met in San Francisco in 1945, attempts to limit obligations of Members under Article 25 of the Charter to those decisions taken by the Council in the exercise of its specific powers under Chapters VI, VII and VIII of the Charter failed. It was stated at the time that those obligations also flowed from the authority conferred on the Council under Article 24(1) to act on the behalf of the members while exercising its responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Article 24, interpreted in this sense, becomes a source of authority which can be drawn upon to meet situations which are not covered by the more detailed provisions in the succeeding articles. The Repertory on Article 24 says: &quot;The question whether Article 24 confers general powers on the Security Council ceased to be a subject of discussion following the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice rendered on 21 June 1971 in connection with the question of Namibia (ICJ Reports, 1971, page 16)&quot;.

In exercising its powers the Security Council seldom bothers to cite the particular article or articles of the UN Charter that its decisions are based upon. In cases where none are mentioned, a constitutional interpretation is required. This sometimes presents ambiguities as to what amounts to a &quot;decision&quot; as opposed to a &quot;recommendation&quot;.

If the Security Council cannot reach consensus or a passing vote on a resolution, its members may choose to produce a non-binding presidential statement instead of a Resolution. These are adopted by consensus. They are meant to apply political pressure—a warning that the Council is paying attention and further action may follow.

Press statements typically accompany both resolutions and presidential statements, carrying the text of the document adopted by the body and also some explanatory text. They may also be released independently, after a significant meeting.

<text>Max Simon Nordau (born Simon Maximilian Südfeld; 29 July 1849 – 23 January 1923) was a Zionist leader, physician, author, and social critic. He was a co-founder of the Zionist Organization together with Theodor Herzl, and president or vice-president of several Zionist congresses.

In his younger years he was known as a social critic, writing &quot;The Conventional Lies of Our Civilisation&quot; (1883), &quot;Degeneration&quot; (1892), and &quot;Paradoxes&quot; (1896). By 1913, Nordau was established as the earliest major critic of modernism. Although not his most popular or successful work while alive, &quot;Degeneration&quot; is the book most often remembered and cited today.

==Biography==
Simon (Simcha) Maximilian Südfeld (later Max Nordau) was born in Pest, Kingdom of Hungary, then part of the Austrian Empire. His father, Gabriel Südfeld, was a rabbi, but earned his livelihood as a Hebrew tutor. As an Orthodox Jew, Nordau attended a Jewish elementary school and earned a medical degree from the University of Pest in 1872. He then traveled for six years, visiting the principal countries of Europe. He changed his name before going to Berlin in 1873. In 1878 he began the practice of medicine in Budapest. In 1880 he went to Paris. He worked in Paris as a correspondent for &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;, and it was in Paris that he spent most of his life.

Before entering the university, he had begun his literary career in Budapest as contributor and dramatic critic for &quot;Der Zwischenact&quot;. Subsequently, he was an editorial writer and correspondent for several other newspapers. His newspaper writings were collected and furnished the material for his earlier books. He was a disciple of Cesare Lombroso.

Nordau was an example of a fully assimilated and acculturated European Jew. Despite being raised religious, Nordau was an agnostic. He married a Christian woman of Danish origin. Despite his Hungarian background, he felt affiliated to German culture, writing in an autobiographical sketch &quot;When I reached the age of fifteen, I left the Jewish way of life and the study of the Torah ... Judaism remained a mere memory and since then I have always felt as a German and as a German only.&quot; Max Nordau was the father of the painter Maxa Nordau (1897–1993).

Nordau&#x27;s conversion to Zionism was eventually triggered by the Dreyfus affair. Many Jews, amongst them Theodor Herzl, saw in the Dreyfus affair evidence of the universality of antisemitism.

Nordau went on to play a major role in the World Zionist Organization; indeed Nordau&#x27;s relative fame certainly helped bring attention to the Zionist movement. He can be credited with giving the organization a democratic character.

In December 1903 a 24-year-old Russian student attempted to assassinate Nordau at a Parisian Hanukkah celebration. The attacker shouted &quot;Death to the East African&quot; as he fired his gun.

When World War I broke out, as a native of Hungary he was accused of German sympathies. He denied the charge and afterward went to reside in Madrid.

== Zionism ==
=== Dreyfus affair ===

Nordau&#x27;s conversion to Zionism is in many ways typical of the rise of Zionism amongst Western European Jewry. The Dreyfus affair was central to Theodor Herzl&#x27;s conviction that Zionism was now necessary. Herzl&#x27;s views were formed during his time in France where he recognized the universality of antisemitism; the Dreyfus Affair cemented his belief in the failure of assimilation. Nordau also witnessed the Paris mob outside the École Militaire crying &quot;à morts les juifs!&quot; (&quot;death to the Jews!&quot;).

His role of friend and advisor to Herzl, who was working as the correspondent for the Viennese &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;, began here in Paris. This trial went beyond a miscarriage of justice and in Herzl&#x27;s words &quot;contained the wish of the overwhelming majority in France, to damn a Jew, and in this one Jew, all Jews&quot;. Whether or not the antisemitism manifested in France during the Dreyfus affair was indicative of the majority of the French or simply a very vocal minority is open to debate. However, the very fact that such sentiment had manifested itself in France was particularly significant. This was the country often seen as the model of the modern enlightened age, that had given Europe the Great Revolution and beginnings of Jewish emancipation.

=== Failure of emancipation ===

Nordau&#x27;s work as a critic of European civilization and where it was heading certainly contributed to his eventual role in Zionism. One of the central tenets of Nordau&#x27;s beliefs was evolution, in all things, and he concluded that emancipation was not born out of evolution. French rationalism of the 18th century, based on pure logic, demanded that all men be treated equally. Nordau perceived Jewish Emancipation the result of &quot;a regular equation: Every man is born with certain rights; the Jews are human beings, consequently the Jews are born to own the rights of man.&quot; This Emancipation was written in the statute books of Europe, but contrasted with popular social consciousness. It was this which explained the apparent contradiction of equality before the law. Yet the existence of antisemitism, and in particular &#x27;racial&#x27; antisemitism, was no longer based on old religious bigotry. Nordau cited England as an exception to this continental antisemitism that proved the rule. &quot;In England, Emancipation is a truth … It had already been completed in the heart before legislation expressly confirmed it.&quot; Only if Emancipation came from changes within society, as opposed to abstract ideas imposed upon society, could it be a reality. Nordau&#x27;s rejection of the accepted idea of Emancipation was not based entirely on the Dreyfus Affair. It had manifested itself much earlier in &quot;The Conventional Lies of Our Civilisation&quot; &quot;(Die konventionellen Lügen der Kulturmenschheit)&quot; (1883), and in reviling &#x27;degenerate&#x27; and &#x27;lunatic&#x27; antisemitism in &quot;Degeneration&quot; &quot;(Die Entartung)&quot; (1892).

===Muscular Judaism===
Nordau also, at the 1898 Zionist Congress, coined the term &quot;muscular Judaism&quot; (&quot;Muskeljudentum&quot;) as a descriptor of a Jewish culture and religion which directed its adherents to reach for certain moral and corporeal ideals which, through discipline, agility and strength, would result in a stronger, more physically assured, Jew who would outshine the long-held stereotype of the weak, intellectually sustained, Jew. He further explored the concept of the &quot;muscle Jew&quot; in a 1900 article of the &quot;Jewish Gymnastics Journal&quot;.

== World Zionist Congress ==

Nordau was central to the Zionist Congresses which played such a vital part in shaping what Zionism would become. Herzl had favoured the idea of a Jewish newspaper and an elitist &quot;Society of Jews&quot; to spread the ideas of Zionism. It was Nordau, convinced that Zionism had to at least appear democratic, despite the impossibility of representing all Jewish groups, who persuaded Herzl of the need for an assembly. This appearance of democracy certainly helped counter accusations that the &quot;Zionists represented no one but themselves&quot;. There were to be eleven such Congresses in all. The first, which Nordau organized, was in Basle, 29–31 August 1897. His fame as an intellectual helped draw attention to the project. Indeed, the fact that Max Nordau, the trenchant essayist and journalist, was a Jew came as a revelation for many. Herzl obviously took centre stage, making the first speech at the Congress; Nordau followed him with an assessment of the Jewish condition in Europe. Nordau used statistics to paint a portrait of the dire straits of Eastern Jewry and also expressed his belief in the destiny of Jewish people as a democratic nation state, free of what he saw as the constraints of Emancipation.

Nordau&#x27;s speeches to the World Zionist Congress re-examined the Jewish people, in particular stereotypes of the Jews. He fought against the tradition of seeing the Jews as merchants or business people, arguing that most modern financial innovations such as insurance had been invented by gentiles. He saw the Jewish people as having a unique gift for politics, a calling which they were unable to fulfil without their own nation-state. Whereas Herzl favoured the idea of an elite forming policy, Nordau insisted the Congress have a democratic nature of some sort, calling for votes on key topics.

At the Sixth Zionist Congress, Nordau defended a Jewish state in the Holy Land, publicizing a support from the British Empire, the Kaiser, the Russian Empire and a possible support from the American government in a near future.

Nordau died in Paris, France in 1923.

==&quot;Degeneration&quot; (1892)==

Nordau&#x27;s major work &quot;Entartung&quot; (&quot;Degeneration&quot;) is a moralistic attack on what he believed to be degenerate art, as well as a polemic against the effects of a range of the rising social phenomena of the period, such as rapid urbanization and its perceived effects on the human body.

In &quot;Réflexions sur la question gay&quot; (translated into English as &quot;Insult and the Making of the Gay Self&quot;), Didier Eribon refers to a whole section in Nordau&#x27;s book targeting Oscar Wilde in aggressive terms: &quot;Wilde loves immorality, sin, and crime&quot;. According to Eribon, the two volumes of &quot;Degeneration&quot; are centred on a description of the artistic and literary currents of an &quot;end-of-century&quot; that was leading society to &quot;ruin&quot;. Nordau attacks symbolists, mystics, Pre-Raphaelites, Wagnerism, Aestheticism, and Decadentism. Huysmans and Zola are also targeted by him as &quot;neurotics&quot; and &quot;the worst kind of enemies of society&quot;, against whom the latter had &quot;a duty to defend itself&quot;. He sustained that society was &quot;at the highest of a serious intellectual epidemic, some kind of Black Death of degeneration and hysteria, such that it is only natural to hear a generalized, anguished questioning: &#x27;What is going to happen?&#x27;&quot; Therefore, he called upon judges, teachers, politicians, all those who wished to protect civilization, to organize repression and censorship. As for psychiatrists, their role would be predominant in such academia of &quot;honest people&quot; in charge of condemning &quot;works that speculate on immorality&quot;. Any artist whom this small cluster of &quot;the most qualified men of the people&quot; might dislike would be doomed, because in such case &quot;both the man and his work would be annihilated&quot;.

Nordau&#x27;s &quot;Degeneration&quot; is cited by William James in his lecture on Neurology and Religion at the beginning of &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. James mocks the author for his &quot;bulky book&quot; on the grounds that he exemplifies the then-current school of medical materialism, stating that Nordau &quot;has striven to impugn the value of works of genius in a wholesale way (such works of contemporary art, namely, as he himself is unable to enjoy, and they are many) by using medical arguments&quot;.

== Commemoration==

In 1926 Nordau&#x27;s remains were moved to Tel Aviv&#x27;s Trumpeldor Cemetery. A major Tel Aviv street is named Nordau Boulevard.

There has been a literary Nordau Prize awarded in Israel.
