<text>Judah Loew ben Bezalel (; 1512 – 17 September 1609), also known as Rabbi Loew ( Löw, Loewe, Löwe or Levai), the Maharal of Prague (), or simply the Maharal (the Hebrew acronym of &quot;Moreinu ha-Rav Loew&quot;, &#x27;Our Teacher, Rabbi Loew&#x27;), was an important Talmudic scholar, Jewish mystic, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who, for most of his life, served as a leading rabbi in the cities of Mikulov in Moravia and Prague in Bohemia.

Loew wrote on Jewish philosophy and Jewish mysticism. His work &quot;Gur Aryeh al HaTorah&quot; is a supercommentary on Rashi&#x27;s Torah commentary. He is also the subject of a later legend that he created the Golem of Prague, an animate being fashioned from clay.

==Name==

His name &quot;Löw&quot; or &quot;Loew&quot; is derived from the German &quot;Löwe&quot;, &quot;lion&quot; (cf. the Yiddish &quot;Leib&quot; of the same origin). It is a kinnui, or substitute name, for the Hebrew name Judah or &quot;Yehuda&quot;, as the Biblical character Judah was likened to a lion in . Lavi from that verse on Judah, is a lioness, hence his name Yehudah Lavi. In Jewish naming tradition, the Hebrew name and the substitute name are often combined as a pair, as in this case in which the combined name is Judah Loew. When Loew wrote his classic supercommentary on Rashi&#x27;s Torah commentary, he entitled it &quot;Gur Aryeh al HaTorah&quot; in Hebrew, meaning &quot;Young Lion [commenting] upon the Torah&quot;.

Loew&#x27;s tomb in Prague is decorated with a heraldic shield with a lion with two intertwined tails (&quot;queue fourchee&quot;), alluding both to his first name and to Bohemia, the arms of which has a two-tailed lion.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Loew was probably born in Poznań, Poland,—though Perels lists the birth town mistakenly as Worms in the Holy Roman Empire—to Rabbi Bezalel (Loew), whose family originated from the Rhenish town of Worms. Perels claimed that his grandfather Chajim of Worms was the grandson of Judah Leib the Elder and thus a claimant to the Davidic line, through Sherira Gaon. However, modern scholars such as Otto Muneles have challenged this. Loew&#x27;s birth year is uncertain, with different sources listing 1512, 1520 and 1526. His uncle Jakob ben Chajim was &quot;Reichsrabbiner&quot; (&quot;Rabbi of the Empire&quot;) of the Holy Roman Empire, and his older brother Chaim of Friedberg was a famous rabbinical scholar and Rabbi of Worms and Friedberg.

Sources in the Lubavitch tradition say that at the age of 12, Loew went to yeshivahs in Poland and studied under Rabbi Yaakov Pollak. After Pollak left Poland, Loew spent 2 years wandering from place to place and then went onto the yeshivah of Rabbi Yitzchak Clover/Wormz, himself a student of Pollak. He learnt together in yeshivah with the Maharshal who was 17, 2 years his elder. He learnt together with the Maharshal and Rema for a further 3 years. Rav Yitzchok Clover was in fact the grandfather of the Maharshal. The Maharshal left Poland and the Maharal remained and studied with the Rema for 2 more years. Maharal was 18 years his senior. He spent 20 years studying before he married.

It is not known however who he learnt nistar from as he mentions his rabbis, who are unknown to posterity, only once in his sefarim. It was common in yeshivas in Poland however to learn nigleh and nistar together

===Career===
Loew accepted a rabbinical position in 1553 as &quot;Landesrabbiner&quot; of Moravia at Mikulov (Nikolsburg), directing community affairs but also determining which tractate of the Talmud was to be studied in the communities in that province. He also revised the community statutes on the election and taxation process. Although he retired from Moravia in 1573 the communities still considered him an authority long after that.

One of his activities in Moravia was the rallying against slanderous slurs on legitimacy (&quot;Nadler&quot;) that were spread in the community against certain families and could ruin the finding of a marriage partner for the children of those families. This phenomenon even affected his own family. He used one of the two yearly grand sermons (between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur 1583) to denounce the phenomenon.

Loew moved to Prague in 1573, where he again accepted a rabbinical position, replacing the retired Isaac Hayoth. He immediately reiterated his views on &quot;Nadler&quot;. On 23 February 1592, he had an audience with Emperor Rudolf II, which he attended together with his brother Sinai and his son-in-law Isaac Cohen; Prince Bertier was present with the emperor. The conversation seems to have been related to Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism, Hebrew: קַבָּלָה) a subject which held much fascination for the emperor.

In 1592, Loew moved to Poznań, where he had been elected as Chief Rabbi of Poland. In Poznań he composed &quot;Netivoth Olam&quot; and part of &quot;Derech Chaim&quot; (see below).

===Personal life===
Loew&#x27;s family consisted of his wife, Pearl, six daughters, and a son, Bezalel, who became a rabbi in Kolín, but died early in 1600.
His wife was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, which allowed him to devote himself to scholarship.

His elder brother was Hayim ben Bezalel, who authored a legal work Vikuach Mayim Chaim which challenged the rulings of Krakow legalist, Moshe Isserles.

===Death===
Towards the end of his life Loew moved back to Prague, where he died in 1609. Loew is buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague in Josefov, where his grave and tombstone are intact.

==Thought==
Loew&#x27;s numerous philosophical works have become cornerstones of Jewish thought; and he was the author of &quot;one of the most creative and original systems of thought developed by East European Jewry.&quot;

He employed rationalist terminology and classical philosophical ideas in his writings, and supported scientific research on condition that it did not contradict divine revelation. Nevertheless, Loew&#x27;s work was in many ways a reaction to the tradition of medieval rationalist Jewish thought, which prioritized a systematic analysis of philosophical concepts, and implicitly downgraded the more colorful and ad-hoc imagery of earlier rabbinic commentary. One of Loew&#x27;s constant objectives was to demonstrate how such earlier commentary was in fact full of insightful commentary on humanity, nature, holiness, an other topics. According to Loew, the multitude of disconnected opinions and perspectives in classical rabbinic literature do not form a haphazard jumble, but rather exemplify the diversity of meanings that can be extracted from a single idea or concept.

Loew&#x27;s writings use as sources the Biblical verses and the recorded traditions of the rabbis, but through literary and conceptual analysis he develops these into a comprehensive philosophical system in which the following terminology recurs:
* &quot;seder&quot; and &quot;nivdal&quot; (&quot;order&quot; and &quot;transcendence&quot;) - any realm has a natural &quot;order&quot; and nature, but may also contain exceptions which are entirely unlike the realm in nature.
* &quot;guf, nefesh, sechel&quot; (&quot;body&quot;, &quot;life-force&quot;, &quot;intellect&quot;) - different levels of a single overall reality. &quot;guf&quot; (the material) is bounded in dimension and is acted upon. &quot;Nefesh&quot; is unbounded, and both acts and is acted upon. &quot;Sechel&quot; is unbounded, and tends only to be acted upon.
* &quot;pail, nifal&quot; (active, acted upon) - describing the relationship between different levels of reality
* &quot;yesodot, taarovot, tarkovot&quot; (bases, mixtures, combinations) - when different elements of reality are combined, they may remain as separate &quot;bases&quot;, or else form a relationship (a &quot;mixture&quot;), or else generate an entirely new entity (&quot;combinations&quot;).
* &quot;ribui, ahadut&quot; (multiplicity, unity)

An example of this terminology is Loew&#x27;s philosophical interpretation of the following midrash: &quot;The world was created for three things: challah, maaser, and bikkurim.&quot; According to Loew, bikkurim represents &quot;yesodot&quot; (as individual fruit are given), maaser represents &quot;taarovot&quot; (as the fruit are gathered together and a fraction of them separated as a tithe), and &quot;challah&quot; represents &quot;tarkovot&quot; (as a new substance, dough, is created from the ingredients).

Loew&#x27;s worldview assumes that reality consists of a single cause, as well as diverse caused phenomena whose existence is constantly sustained by their cause. There is no room for randomness in reality, as that would indicated an absence of omnipotence or omniscience in the Cause. For Loew, the uniform caused nature of reality also indicates the existence of moral order in the world. Science can describe the phenomena in the world, but it cannot create a preference for one over the other; such moral preferences must come from the higher order of the Torah, which Loew calls the &quot;higher intellect&quot; (שכל עליון).

Loew emphasized the value of honesty and straightforwardness. Among other things, this led him to criticize the pilpul methodology common in yeshivas of his time. He even suggested to avoid learning the commentaries of Tosafot until one has reached an advanced level of understanding.

Like Yehudah Halevi, he focused on the distinction between the physical and the spiritual, seeing the Jewish people as possessing an essentially spiritual nature which distinguishes it from all other phenomena in the world.

Lowe did not espouse kabbalah or other Jewish mystical traditions, though he was familiar with them.

==Influence==
===Disciples===
It is unknown how many Talmudic rabbinical scholars Loew taught in Moravia, but the main disciples from the Prague period include Rabbis Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller and David Gans. The former promoted his teacher&#x27;s program of regular Mishnah study by the masses, and composed his &quot;Tosefoth Yom Tov&quot; (a Mishnah commentary incorporated into almost all published editions of the Mishnah over the past few hundred years) with this goal in mind. David Ganz wrote &quot;Tzemach David&quot;, a work of Jewish and general history, as well as writing on astronomy; both Loew and Ganz were in contact with Tycho Brahe, the famous astronomer.

===Commemoration===

Kerem Maharal, a moshav in northern Israel, was established by Czech Jewish immigrants and named in Loew&#x27;s honour.

In April 1997, Czech Republic and Israel jointly issued a set of stamps, one of which featured the tombstone of Loew. In May 2009, the Czech Post issued a stamp commemorating the 400th anniversary of Loew&#x27;s death. In June 2009 the Czech Mint issued a commemorative coin marking the same milestone. The Statue of Judah Loew ben Bezalel stands in Prague.

==Legend of the golem==
Loew is the subject of the legend about the creation of a golem, a creature made out of clay to defend the Jews of the Prague Ghetto from antisemitic attacks, particularly the blood libel. He is said to have used mystical powers based on the esoteric knowledge of how God created Adam. The general view of historians and critics is that the legend is a German literary invention of the early 19th century. The earliest known source for the story thus far is the 1834 book &quot;Der Jüdische Gil Blas&quot; by Friedrich Korn. It has been repeated and adapted many times since.

==Works==

He began publishing his books at a very late age. In 1578, at the age of 66, he published his first book, &quot;Gur Aryeh&quot; (&quot;Young Lion&quot;, Prague 1578) - an supercommentary in five volumes for Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Torah, which goes well beyond that, and four years later he published his book &quot;Gevuroth HaShem&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s Might[y Acts]&quot;, Cracow 1582) anonymously.

*&quot;Gur Aryeh&quot; (&quot;Young Lion&quot;, Prague 1578), a supercommentary on Rashi&#x27;s Pentateuch commentary
*&quot;Gevuroth Hashem&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s Mighty Acts&quot;, Cracow 1582), for the holiday of Passover - On the Exodus and the Miracles.
*&quot;Derech Chaim&quot; (&quot;Way of Life&quot;, Cracow 1589), a commentary on the Mishnah tractate Avoth

*&quot;Netzach Yisrael&quot; (&quot;The Eternity of Israel&quot;, Prague 1599; &quot;Netzach&quot; &quot;eternity&quot;, has the same root as the word for victory), on Tisha B&#x27;Av (an annual day of mourning about the destruction of the Temples and the Jewish exile) and the final deliverance
*&quot;Tif&#x27;ereth Yisrael&quot; (&quot;The Glory of Israel&quot;, Venice 1599), philosophical exposition on the Torah, intended for the holiday of Shavuot
*&quot;Or Chadash&quot; (&quot;A New Light&quot;, Prague 1600), on Purim
*&quot;Ner Mitzvah&quot; (&quot;The Candle of the Commandment&quot;, Prague 1600), on Hanukkah
*&quot;Chiddushei Aggadot&quot; (&quot;Novellae on the Aggada&quot;, the narrative portions of the Talmud), discovered in the 20th century
*&quot;Divrei Negidim&quot; (&quot;Words of Rectors&quot;), a commentary on the Seder of Pesach, published by a descendant
*&quot;Chiddushim al Ha-Shas&quot;, a commentary on Talmud, recently published for the first time from a manuscript by Machon Yerushalayim on Bava Metzia; Shabbos, and Eruvin; others may be forthcoming.
*Various other works, such as his responsa and works on the Jewish Sabbath and the holidays of Sukkot, Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, have not been preserved.

His works on the holidays bear titles that were inspired by the Biblical verse in I Chronicles 29:11: &quot;Yours, O Lord, are the greatness, and the might, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and on the earth [is Yours]; Yours is the kingdom and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything as the Leader.&quot; The book of &quot;greatness&quot; (&quot;gedula&quot;) on the Sabbath was not preserved, but the book of &quot;power&quot; (&quot;gevurah&quot;) is &quot;Gevurath Hashem&quot;, the book of glory (&quot;tif&#x27;arah&quot;) is &quot;Tif&#x27;ereth Yisrael&quot;, and the book of &quot;eternity&quot; or &quot;victory&quot; (&quot;netzach&quot;) is &quot;Netzach Yisrael&quot;.

<text>Philipp Veit (13 February 179318 December 1877) was a German Romantic painter and one of the main exponents of the Nazarene movement. It is to Veit that the credit of having been the first to revive the nearly forgotten technique of fresco painting is due.

==Biography==
Veit was born in Berlin, Prussia. He was the son of a banker, Simon Veit and his wife Brendel, daughter of Moses Mendelssohn. After Veit&#x27;s parents divorced in 1799, Veit initially stayed with his mother and lived with her and her new husband Friedrich Schlegel in Jena, Paris, and Cologne. In 1806, he returned to his father in Berlin and finished his schooling in the &quot;Graues Kloster&quot;. From 1808 on, Veit received his first art education at the Royal Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, where he was taught by Friedrich Matthäi and Caspar David Friedrich, later in Vienna. Although a prodigious talent when it came to drawing, Veit was not comfortable with oil painting, for which reason in Vienna he took to the medium of watercolour. In Vienna, he made the acquaintance of Schlegel, and through him came to know several Viennese Romantics, one of whom was the poet and novelist Joseph von Eichendorff. He was strongly influenced by, and joined, the Nazarene movement in Rome, where he worked for some years before moving to Frankfurt.

In 1810, Veit converted to Catholicism together with his mother and his senior brother Johannes Veit. While participating in the struggle against Napoleon in 1813–14 (the German campaign of 1813 or War of the Sixth Coalition), first as a &quot;Lützower Jäger&quot; and part of the Lützow Free Corps, subsequently as a member of the &quot;Kleistsche Armeekorps&quot;, a corps led by Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf, and returning to Berlin for a short period, Veit became closer friends with the mentioned above poet Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff and his own lieutenant Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué. Beginning in 1811, Veit was more teaching himself and finished a couple of portraits (Zichy-Vásonykeő, Julie Gräfin, lost; Franz Xaver von Baader and other members of Vienna&#x27;s society and exponents of Romanticism). In 1815, he finished his first religious painting. &quot;Virgin with Christ and St John&quot;, a votive painting for the church of St James in Heiligenstadt, Vienna. The painting shows already close ties to the Nazarene movement and thus was inspired by the style of Pietro Perugino and Raphael.

==Rome==
Rome was at that time of fundamental importance not only to artists of all stripes but—as the religious centre of Christianity—especially to artists prepared to re-create a spiritually inspired art, seeking for inspiration in the art of the Middle Ages and of the early Renaissance and living a nearly monastic existence similar to the medieval artist&#x27;s workshop (with almost entirely Christian patrons), a reason why the artists&#x27; group was named according to the medieval guilds of painters or &quot;Lukasbund &quot;(Brotherhood of St Luke). In 1816, Veit joined the brotherhood which inhabited—or had occupied—the abandoned monastery of Sant&#x27;Isidoro. Since 1815, Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Peter von Cornelius, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, and later Veit frescoed a room in the &quot;Casa Bartholdy&quot; called Palazzo Zuccari on the Pincian Hill, which at that time was owned by Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, the Prussian Consul-General. The commission was given to Schadow and his young compatriots with the selected subject of Joseph and his brethren. While &quot;The Bloody Coat&quot; and &quot;Joseph in Prison&quot; were conferred to Schadow, Veit executed &quot;Potiphar&#x27;s wife&quot; and the &quot;Seven Years of Great Abundance&quot; (in 1867, the frescoes were sold by the Zuccari family to the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin). In 1817, Veit received the commission for a fresco in the Museo Chiaramonti (part of the Vatican, set out in the long loggia which joins the Palace of Belvedere with the Vatican) with the allegorical subject of &quot;The Triumph of the Religion&quot;. A simultaneous replica (executed in oil on canvas) was exhibited in 1819 in the Palazzo Caffarelli on the Capitol Hill and is today part of the collection of the National Gallery in Berlin. Among the frescoes in the Casino Massimo, the second renowned example of composite work of Nazarene art in Rome, Veit executed scenes, e.g., of the &quot;Paradiso&quot;, at the ceiling of the Dante room, after Dante Alighieri&#x27;s Divine Comedy. At the same time, around 1824, Veit was commissioned by the canon Christian Leberecht von Ampach to execute a painting with the subject of &quot;Christ at the Mount of Olives&quot; (&quot;Christus am Ölberg&quot;, finished 1825) for the Chapel of the Three Magi (Dreikönigskapelle) at Naumburg Cathedral in Germany. In 1821, Veit had married a young girl, Carolina Pulini (1807–1890), the daughter of his landlord, the sculptor Gioacchino Pulini (1777–1857). Carolina gave birth to five children: 1822 Dorothea, 1824 Theresa, 1826 Franziska, 1828 Maria Benedetta, and 1830 Friedrich.

Still in Rome in 1824, Veit was depicted as a member of German artists&#x27; circles in Franz Ludwig Catel&#x27;s famous group portrait &quot;Crown Prince Ludwig in the Spanish Wine Tavern in Rome&quot;; Veit is said to be the person sitting between the two standing figures of von Wagner and Dr. Ringseis on the right side of the table. In 1829–30, Veit executed a &quot;Maria Immaculata&quot; for the Capella Orsini (a northern chapel) of Santa Trinità dei Monti, moreover the last work of his Roman period, with clear stylistic impact of Raphael and Perugino.

==Frankfurt==
In October 1830, Veit arrived in Frankfurt on Main together with his wife Carolina and their five children. In Frankfurt on Main, where his most important works are preserved at the Städel, he was active from 1830 to 1843 as director of the art collections and as professor of painting. Among his most renowned pupils are Alfred Rethel and Edward von Steinle. Around 1832, Veit decided for the first time to depict subjects of ancient mythology (e.g. &quot;Shield of Achilles&quot;) on the ceiling of one of the Städel&#x27;s &quot;Antikensäle&quot;. Other decorations for the old Städel building were the frescoes &quot;Die Einführung der Künste durch das Christentum in Deutschland&quot; (The Arts Being Introduced to Germany by Christianity) with the allegories of Germania and &quot;Italia&quot;. Originally, the three-parted fresco adorned the old premises of the Institute in Neue Mainzer Straße. Actually, it displays a conversion scene (through the sermon of Saint Boniface) in the centre-panel while the allegories of &quot;Germania&quot; and &quot;Italia&quot; on the side panels represent secular and spiritual power. It was removed in 1877 and transferred into the new building. On the occasion of the national assembly of 1848, for which Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral of Frankfurt on Main was used as an assembly hall, Veit executed a second version of the &quot;Germania&quot;-painting (oil on canvas) which hung in full view on the wall above the chair people as an appeal to all German states to create a unitary constitution during the first all-German Parliament. Between 1840 and 1852, four so-called portraits of German rulers (which were, actually, pictures of Holy Roman emperors) were painted by Veit: &quot;Friedrich II.&quot; (Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor), &quot;Heinrich VII.&quot; (Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor), &quot;Otto der Große&quot; (Otto the Great) and &quot;Karl der Große&quot; (Charlemagne) as donation for the &quot;Kaisersaal&quot; (Emperor&#x27;s Hall) in the City Hall of Frankfurt.

From 1853 till his death in 1877 he held the post of director of the municipal gallery in Mainz. 
Like his fellow Nazarenes he was more draughtsman than painter, and though his sense of colour was stronger than that of Overbeck or Cornelius, his works are generally more of the nature of coloured cartoons than of paintings in the modern sense.

Among Veit&#x27;s other principal works is his &quot;Assumption&quot; in the Frankfurt Cathedral, while the Alte Nationalgalerie of Berlin has his painting of &quot;The Two Marys at the Sepulchre&quot;.
Veit died in Mainz.

<doc id="176034" wikidata="Q1351447" url="?curid=176034" title="Ron Ely">
<text>Ronald Pierce Ely (June 21, 1938 – September 29, 2024) was an American actor and novelist, best known for portraying Tarzan in the 1966–1968 NBC series &quot;Tarzan&quot; and playing the lead role in the film &quot;Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze&quot; (1975). He hosted the &quot;Miss America&quot; pageant telecast in 1980 and 1981.

==Career==

Ely won the role of Tarzan in 1966 after playing supporting roles in films such as &quot;South Pacific&quot; (1958), as an airplane navigator, &quot;The Fiend Who Walked the West&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker&quot; (1959).

During the filming of &quot;Tarzan&quot;, Ely did almost all of his own stunts, and received over two dozen injuries, including two broken shoulders and several lion bites.

Ely&#x27;s height (6&#x27;4&quot;) and athletic build also won him the title role in the film &quot;Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze&quot; (1975), as well as various guest shots. He was in five episodes of the series &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;; in one, in 1978, he portrayed Mark Antony in a Roman military short tunic and breastplate and starred in the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; two-part episode, &quot;The Deadly Sting&quot;.

Ely starred on the series &quot;The Aquanauts&quot; in 1960–1961, in the western adventure film &quot;The Night of the Grizzly&quot; (1966) opposite Clint Walker, and later appeared in Jürgen Goslar&#x27;s slavery movie &quot;Slavers&quot; (1978). In the 1980s, he hosted the musical game show &quot;Face the Music&quot;, as well as the 1980 and 1981 Miss America Pageants, replacing longtime host Bert Parks. He starred in a 1987–1988 revival of the 1960s adventure series &quot;Sea Hunt&quot; as Mike Nelson, the role played by Lloyd Bridges in the original series.

In the 1990s, Ely&#x27;s roles included a retired alternate universe variant of Superman in the &quot;Superboy&quot; episode &quot;The Road to Hell&quot;, and hunter Gordon Shaw in the &quot;Tarzán&quot; episode &quot;Tarzan the Hunted&quot;. Until about 2001, he appeared on such shows as &quot;Sheena&quot; and &quot;Renegade&quot;. He wrote two mystery novels featuring private investigator Jake Sands: &quot;Night Shadows&quot; (1994) and &quot;East Beach&quot; (1995).

Ely retired from acting in 2001, returning with an appearance in the television film &quot;Expecting Amish&quot; (2014).

==Personal life and death==
Ely was born in Hereford, Texas on June 21, 1938 and raised in Amarillo. He married his high school sweetheart, Helen Janet Triplet, in 1959. Both natives of Hereford, Texas, they divorced in July 1961.

In 1984, Ely married Valerie Lundeen, who won the Miss Florida USA title in 1981, and they had three children. 

===Murder of wife and death of son===
On October 15, 2019, Ely&#x27;s son Cameron, then 30 years old, stabbed Valerie Ely to death at the family&#x27;s home in Hope Ranch, California, a coastal residential community in Santa Barbara. Police officers were called to the scene for a &quot;family disturbance&quot; and killed Cameron Ely, claiming he posed a threat to officers. 

The Santa Barbara district attorney ruled the police shooting a justifiable homicide. No charges were filed, and an attorney representing Ely disputed the police account of Cameron&#x27;s death. An autopsy found Cameron was in the early stages of chronic traumatic encephalopathy before he died.

===Death===

Ely died at the home of one of his daughters in Los Alamos, California, on September 29, 2024, at age 86. His death was not announced until October 23, 2024.

<doc id="176037" wikidata="Q192062" url="?curid=176037" title="Bartolomé Esteban Murillo">
<text>Bartolomé Esteban Murillo ( , ; late December 1617, baptized January 1, 1618April 3, 1682) was a Spanish Baroque painter. Although he is best known for his religious works, Murillo also produced a considerable number of paintings of contemporary women and children. These lively realistic portraits of flower girls, street urchins, and beggars constitute an extensive record of the everyday life of his times. He also painted two self-portraits, one in the Frick Collection portraying him in his 30s, and one in London&#x27;s National Gallery portraying him about 20 years later. In 2017–18, the two museums held an exhibition of them.

==Childhood==
Murillo was probably born in December 1617 to Gaspar Esteban, an accomplished barber surgeon, and María Pérez Murillo. He may have been born in Seville or in Pilas, a smaller Andalusian town. It is clear that he was baptized in Santa Maria Magdalena, a parish in Seville in 1618. After his parents died in 1627 and 1628, he became a ward of his older sister Ana and her husband, Juan Agustín Lagares, who coincidentally also happened to be a barber. Murillo seemed to have remained close to the couple considering he did not leave their house until his marriage in 1645. Eleven years later, he was named the executor of Lagares&#x27; will despite his sister having already died. Murillo seldom used his father&#x27;s surname, and instead took his surname from his maternal grandmother, Elvira Murillo.

==Early life and formative years==

There are few documents on the early years of Murillo&#x27;s life or on his origins as a painter. In 1633, at 15, Murillo received a license for passage to America with his family. He probably began his artistic career, either during those years or slightly beforehand. Murillo began his art studies in Seville in the workshop of Juan del Castillo, Murillo&#x27;s uncle and godfather, as well a skilled painter in his own right. Castillo was characterized by the dryness of his sketches and the loving expressions in the subjects he painted, and Murillo took much of this as inspiration in his early work. His first works were also influenced by Francisco de Zurbarán, Jusepe de Ribera and Alonso Cano, and he shared their strongly realist approach. The great commercial importance of Seville at the time ensured that he was subject to artistic influences from other regions. He became familiar with Flemish painting and the &quot;Treatise on Sacred Images&quot; of Molanus (Ian van der Meulen or Molano). As his painting developed, his more important works evolved towards the polished style that suited the bourgeois and aristocratic tastes of the time, demonstrated especially in his Roman Catholic religious works.

According to fellow painter and art historian Antonio Palomino, Murillo left Castillo&#x27;s workshop after feeling he had grown sufficiently skilled in his painting. In 1642, at the age of 26, he allegedly traveled to Madrid, where he most likely became familiar with the work of Velázquez, and saw the work of Francisco de Palacios; the rich colors and softly modeled forms of his subsequent work suggest these influences. While it is likely that, like many Sevillian painters, Murillo took inspiration from religious images in an attempt to attract the lucrative American market, there is actually little evidence of Murillo traveling to Madrid. Similar claims, attributed by Joachim von Sandrart, a German historian of the time, argue that Murillo also travelled to Italy during the same period. Palomino denies these assertions, arguing that they stem from a refusal of foreigners to acknowledge that Murillo&#x27;s success had come from Spain, and Spain alone. 

Palomino, instead, argued that Murillo&#x27;s skill came from hours spent in his room, studying the natural world. He would use these skills when painting for the public, for the Franciscan convents throughout Spain, and for his fellow painters, who until then had little knowledge of his existence or art. In either case, his style could easily have been learned without leaving Seville from its previous generation of artists, such as Francisco de Zarbara or Francisco de Herrera the Elder.

== Career ==
In 1645, he returned to Seville and married Beatriz Cabrera y Villalobos, with whom he eventually had ten children. Of these children, only five outlived their mother, and only one, Gabriel (1655–1700) later carried on the work of Bartolome as a painter. The year of his marriage, Murillo received the first major commission of his career. This was to paint eleven canvases for the convent of San Francisco in Seville. He worked on this project from 1645 until 1648. These works depicted various stories of Franciscan saints which were not often told at the time. When selecting subjects, Murillo placed an emphasis on praising lives of contemplation and prayer as represented in paintings like &quot;Saint Francis Comforted by an Angel&quot;. His works vary between the Zurbaránesque tenebrism of the &quot;Ecstasy of St Francis&quot; and a softly luminous style (as in &quot;Death of St Clare&quot;) that became typical of Murillo&#x27;s mature work. According to the art historian Manuela B. Mena Marqués, &quot;in ... the &quot;Levitation of St Giles&quot; (usually known as &quot;The Angels&#x27; Kitchen&quot;) and the &quot;Death of St Clare&quot; (Dresden, Gemäldegal. Alte Meister), the characteristic elements of Murillo’s work are already evident: the elegance and beauty of the female figures and the angels, the realism of the still-life details and the fusion of reality with the spiritual world, which is extraordinarily well developed in some of the compositions.&quot; Similarly in &quot;Saint Diego Giving Alms&quot;, Murillo carefully places the subjects on parallel planes over black background, and its center, surrounding a boiling pot, are a group of children seemingly bathed in a heavenly glow. In doing so, Murillo managed to combine both tenebrism and luminosity to showcase the glory of aiding the needy and the innocent. 

Also completed was the first of Murillo&#x27;s many paintings of children, &quot;The Young Beggar&quot; (Musée du Louvre), in which the influence of Velázquez is apparent. Following the completion of a pair of pictures for the Seville Cathedral, he began to specialize in the themes that brought him his greatest successes: the Virgin and Child and the Immaculate Conception.

After another period in Madrid, from 1658 to 1660, he returned to Seville. Here he was one of the founders of the Academia de Bellas Artes (Academy of Art), sharing its direction, in 1660, with the architect Francisco Herrera the Younger. This was his period of greatest activity, and he received numerous important commissions, among them the altarpieces for the Augustinian monastery, the paintings for Santa María la Blanca (completed in 1665), and others. He died in Seville in 1682, a few months after he fell from a scaffold while working on a fresco at the church of the Capuchines in Cádiz.

==Legacy==
Murillo had many pupils and followers. The prolific imitation of his paintings ensured his reputation in Spain and fame throughout Europe, and before the 19th century his work was more widely known than that of any other Spanish artist. Artists influenced by his style included Gainsborough and Greuze. Google marked the 400 years since Murillo&#x27;s birth with a doodle on November 29, 2018.

==Public collections==

The Museo del Prado in Madrid; Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia (such as &quot;Boy with a Dog&quot;); and the Wallace Collection in London are among the museums holding works by Murillo. His painting &quot;The Coronation in Heaven of the Mother of God&quot; is on display at the Basilica of St. Joseph Proto-Cathedralin Bardstown Kentucky.
His painting &quot;Christ on the Cross&quot; is at the Timken Museum of Art in San Diego. &quot;Christ After the Flagellation&quot; is at the Krannert Art Museum, Champaign, Illinois. His work is also found at the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and at the Meadows Museum at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.

<text>German philosophy, meaning philosophy in the German language or philosophy by German people, in its diversity, is fundamental for both the analytic and continental traditions. It covers figures such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle, and the Frankfurt School, who now count among the most famous and studied philosophers of all time. They are central to major philosophical movements such as rationalism, German idealism, Romanticism, dialectical materialism, existentialism, phenomenology, hermeneutics, logical positivism, and critical theory. The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard is often also included in surveys of German philosophy due to his extensive engagement with German thinkers.

==Middle ages==

In his writings, Albertus Magnus covers a wide range of topics in science and philosophy.

==17th century==
Jakob Böhme (1575–1624), the Lutheran philosopher who founded Christian theosophy, influenced later key figures including F.W.J. Schelling and G.W.F. Hegel, who called him &quot;the first German philosopher&quot;.

===Leibniz===

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) was both a philosopher and a mathematician who wrote primarily in Latin and French. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great 17th century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz also anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence.

Leibniz is noted for his optimism – his &quot;Théodicée&quot; tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all possible worlds. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.

Leibniz is also known for his theory of monads, as exposited in &quot;Monadologie&quot;. They can also be compared to the corpuscles of the mechanical philosophy of René Descartes and others. Monads are the ultimate elements of the universe. The monads are &quot;substantial forms of being&quot; with the following properties: they are eternal, indecomposable, individual, subject to their own laws, un-interacting, and each reflecting the entire universe in a pre-established harmony (a historically important example of panpsychism). Monads are centers of force; substance is force, while space, matter, and motion are merely phenomenal.

==18th century==
===Wolff===
Christian Wolff (1679–1754) was the most eminent German philosopher between Leibniz and Kant. His main achievement was a complete &quot;oeuvre&quot; on almost every scholarly subject of his time, displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive, mathematical method, which perhaps represents the peak of Enlightenment rationality in Germany.

Wolff was one of the first to use German as a language of scholarly instruction and research, although he also wrote in Latin, so that an international audience could, and did, read him. A founding father of, among other fields, economics and public administration as academic disciplines, he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in government, and stressing the professional nature of university education.

===Kant===

In 1781, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) published his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, in which he attempted to determine what we can and cannot know through the use of reason independent of all experience. Briefly, he came to the conclusion that we could come to know an external world through experience, but that what we could know about it was limited by the limited terms in which the mind can think: if we can only comprehend things in terms of cause and effect, then we can only know causes and effects. It follows from this that we can know the form of all possible experience independent of all experience, but nothing else, but we can never know the world from the &quot;standpoint of nowhere&quot; and therefore we can never know the world in its entirety, neither via reason nor experience.

Since the publication of his &quot;Critique&quot;, Immanuel Kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy. In the late 18th and early 19th century, one direct line of influence from Kant is German Idealism.

==19th century==
===German idealism===

German idealism was a philosophical movement that emerged in Germany in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It developed out of the work of Immanuel Kant in the 1780s and 1790s, and was closely linked both with Romanticism and the revolutionary politics of the Enlightenment. The most prominent German idealists in the movement, besides Kant, were Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814), Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, (1775–1854) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), who was the predominant figure in nineteenth century German philosophy. Also important were the Jena Romantics Friedrich Hölderlin (1770–1843), Novalis (1772–1801), and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772–1829). August Ludwig Hülsen, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, Gottlob Ernst Schulze, Karl Leonhard Reinhold, Salomon Maimon, Friedrich Schleiermacher, and Arthur Schopenhauer also made major contributions.

====Fichte====
As a representative of subjective idealism, Fichte rejected the Kantian &quot;thing-in-itself.&quot; Fichte declares as the starting point of his philosophy the absolute &quot;I,&quot; which itself creates the world with all its laws. Fichte understands the activity of this &quot;I&quot; as the activity of thought, as a process of self-awareness. Fichte recognizes absolute free will, God and the immortality of the soul. He sees in law one of the manifestations of the “I&quot;.

Speaking with progressive slogans of defending the national sovereignty of the Germans from Napoleon, Fichte at the same time put forward chauvinist slogans, especially in his &quot;Addresses to the German Nation&quot; (1808), for which Fichte is regarded as one of the founders of modern German nationalism.

====Schelling====
Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, who initially adhered to the ideas of Fichte, subsequently created his own philosophical system. Nature and consciousness, object and subject, Schelling argued, coincide in the Absolute; Schelling called his philosophy &quot;the philosophy of identity.&quot;

In natural philosophy, Schelling set himself the task of knowing the absolute, infinite spirit that lies at the basis of empirical visible nature. According to Schelling, the science of nature, based exclusively on reason, is designed to reveal the unconditioned cause that produces all natural phenomena. Schelling considered the absolute as a beginning capable of self-development through contradictions; in this sense, Schelling’s philosophy is characterized by some features of idealist dialectics. In his early philosophy, around 1800, Schelling assigned a special role to art, in which, according to him, the reality of &quot;higher being&quot; is fully comprehended. Schelling interpreted art as &quot;revelation.&quot; The artist, according to Schelling at this time, is a kind of mystical creature who creates in unconsciousness.

For Schelling, the main instrument of creativity is intuition, &quot;inner contemplation.&quot; In later life, Schelling evolves towards a mystical philosophy (&quot;Mysterienlehre&quot;). He was invited by the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm IV to the post of professor at the University of Berlin with the aim of combating the then-popular ideas of the left-liberal Young Hegelians. It was during this period of his life that Schelling created the mystical &quot;philosophy of revelation&quot;.

====Hegel====
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel is widely considered to be the greatest German idealist philosopher. According to Hegel’s system of objective or absolute idealism, reality is self-movement, and its activity can be expressed only in thinking, in self-knowledge. It is internally contradictory, it moves and changes, passing into its opposite.

Hegel presents the dialectical process of self-development in three main stages, which are ordered conceptually, not temporally. The first stage is logical, was describes the &quot;pre-natural&quot; structure being in the &quot;element of pure thinking.&quot; At this stage, the &quot;absolute idea&quot; appears as a system of logical concepts and categories, as a system of logic. This part of Hegel&#x27;s philosophical system is set forth in his &quot;Science of Logic&quot;. At the second stage, the &quot;idea&quot; is considered &quot;in its externality&quot; as nature. Hegel expounded his doctrine of nature in The &quot;Philosophy of Nature&quot;. The highest, third step in the self-development of the idea is spirit, which Hegel, for the most part, presents as it increasingly comes to know itself in history. Hegel reveals this stage of development of the &quot;absolute idea&quot; in his work &quot;Philosophy of Spirit&quot; from the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences&quot; and in his lectures at the University of Berlin, many of which cover material not found in his published writings. The highest stage of spirit is presented as in the forms of art, religion, and philosophy.

The main works of Hegel are &quot;The Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; (1807), &quot;Science of Logic&quot; (1812–1816), &quot;Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences&quot; (&quot;Logic,&quot; &quot;Philosophy of Nature,&quot; &quot;Philosophy of Spirit&quot;) (1817), &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot; (1821).

===German Romanticism===
Immanuel Kant&#x27;s criticism of rationalism was a source of influence for early Romantic thought. Hamann&#x27;s and Herder&#x27;s philosophical thoughts were also influential on both the proto-Romantic &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement and on Romanticism itself.

The philosophy of Fichte was of pivotal importance for the Romantics. The founder of German Romanticism, Friedrich Schlegel, identified the &quot;three sources of Romanticism&quot;: the French Revolution, Fichte&#x27;s philosophy, and Goethe&#x27;s novel &quot;Wilhelm Meister&quot;.
Schelling, who was associated with the Schlegel brothers in Jena, took many of his philosophical and aesthetical ideas from the Romantics, and also influenced them on their own views: &quot;In his philosophy of art, Schelling emerged from the subjective boundaries in which Kant concluded aesthetics, referring it only to features of judgment. Schelling&#x27;s aesthetics, understanding the world as an artistic creation, has adopted a universal character and served as the basis for the teachings of the Romantic school.&quot; It is argued that Friedrich Schlegel&#x27;s subjectivism and his glorification of the superior intellect as property of a select elite influenced Schelling&#x27;s doctrine of intellectual intuition, which György Lukács called &quot;the first manifestation of irrationalism&quot;. As much as Early Romanticism influenced the young Schelling&#x27;s &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; (his interpretation of nature as an expression of spiritual powers), so did Late Romanticism influence the older Schelling&#x27;s mythological and mysticist worldview (&quot;Mysterienlehre&quot;).
According to Lukács, Kierkegaard&#x27;s views on philosophy and aesthetics were also an offshoot of Romanticism.
Schopenhauer also owed certain features of his philosophy to Romantic pessimism: &quot;Since salvation from suffering associated with the will is available through art only to a select few, Schopenhauer proposed another, more accessible way of overcoming the &quot;I&quot; – Buddhist Nirvana. In essence, Schopenhauer, although he was confident in the innovation of his revelations, did not give anything original here in comparison with the idealization of the Eastern world outlook by reactionary Romantics – it was indeed Friedrich Schlegel who introduced this idealization in Germany with his &quot;Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier&quot; (&quot;About the language and wisdom of the Indians&quot;).&quot;
In the opinion of György Lukács, Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s importance as an irrationalist philosopher lay in that, while his early influences are to be found in Romanticism, he founded a modern irrationalism antithetical to that of the Romantics Even in his post-Schopenhauerian period, however, Nietzsche paid some tributes to Romanticism, for example borrowing the title of his book &quot;The Gay Science&quot; (&quot;Die fröhliche Wissenschaft&quot;, 1882–87) from Friedrich Schlegel&#x27;s 1799 novel &quot;Lucinde&quot;.

Lukács also emphasized that the emergence of organicism in philosophy received its impetus from Romanticism:
This view, that only &#x27;organic growth&#x27;, that is to say change through small and gradual reforms with the consent of the ruling class, was regarded as &#x27;a natural principle&#x27;, whereas every revolutionary upheaval received the dismissive tag of &#x27;contrary to nature&#x27; gained a particularly extensive form in the course of the development of reactionary German romanticism (Savigny, the historical law school, etc.). The antithesis of &#x27;organic growth&#x27; and &#x27;mechanical fabrication&#x27; was now elaborated: it constituted a defence of &#x27;naturally grown&#x27; feudal privileges against the praxis of the French Revolution and the bourgeois ideologies underlying it, which were repudiated as mechanical, highbrow and abstract.
Wilhelm Dilthey, founder (along with Nietzsche, Simmel, and Klages) of the intuitionist and irrationalist school of &quot;Lebensphilosophie&quot; in Germany, is credited with leading the Romantic revival in hermeneutics of the early 20th century. With his Schleiermacher biography and works on Novalis, Hölderlin, and others, he was one of the initiators of the Romantic renaissance in the imperial period. His discovery and annotation of the young Hegel&#x27;s manuscripts became crucial to the vitalistic interpretation of Hegelian philosophy in the post-war period; his Goethe study likewise ushered in the vitalistic interpretation of Goethe subsequently leading from Simmel and Gundolf to Klages.

Passivity was a key element of the Romantic mood in Germany, and it was brought by the Romantics into their own religious and philosophical views. The theologian Schleiermacher argued that the true essence of religion lies not in the active love of one’s neighbor, but in the passive contemplation of the infinite. In Schelling’s philosophical system, the creative absolute (God) is immersed in the same passive, motionless state.

The only activity that the Romantics allowed is that in which there is almost no volitional element, that is, artistic creativity. They considered the representatives of art to be the happiest people, and in their works, along with knights chained in armor, poets, painters and musicians usually appear. Schelling considered an artist to be incomparably higher than a philosopher, because the secret of the world can be guessed from his minutia not by systematic logical thinking, but only by direct artistic intuition (&quot;intellectual intuition&quot;). Romantics loved to dream of such legendary countries, where all life with its everyday cares gave way to the eternal holiday of poetry.

The quietist and aestheticist mood of Romanticism, the reflection and idealization of the mood of the aristocracy, again emerges in Schopenhauer’s philosophical system &quot;The World as Will and Representation,&quot; ending with a pessimistic chord. Schopenhauer argued that at the heart of the world and man lies the “will to life,” which leads them to suffering and boredom, and happiness can be experienced only by those who free themselves from its oppressive domination. Even the artist is freed from the power of the will only temporarily. As soon as he turns into an ordinary mortal, his greedy will again raises its voice and throws him into the embrace of disappointment and boredom. Above the artist stands, therefore, the Hindu sage or the holy ascetic.

===Karl Marx and the Young Hegelians===

Hegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth century; by its end, according to Bertrand Russell, &quot;the leading academic philosophers, both in America and Britain, were largely Hegelian&quot;. His influence has continued in contemporary philosophy, especially in Continental philosophy.

====Right Hegelians====
Among those influenced by Hegel immediately after his death in 1831, two distinct groups can be roughly divided into the politically and religiously radical &#x27;left&#x27;, or &#x27;young&#x27;, Hegelians and the more conservative &#x27;right&#x27;, or &#x27;old&#x27;, Hegelians. The Right Hegelians followed the master in believing that the dialectic of history had come to an end—Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot; reveals itself to be the culmination of history as the reader reaches its end. Here he meant that reason and freedom had reached their maximums as they were embodied by the existing Prussian state. And here the master’s claim was viewed as paradox, at best; the Prussian regime indeed provided extensive civil and social services, good universities, high employment and some industrialization, but it was ranked as rather backward politically compared with the more liberal constitutional monarchies of France and Britain.

Speculative theism was an 1830s movement closely related to, but distinguished from, Right Hegelianism. Its proponents (Immanuel Hermann Fichte (1796–1879), Christian Hermann Weisse (1801–1866), and Hermann Ulrici (1806–1884) were united in their demand to recover the &quot;personal God&quot; after panrationalist Hegelianism. The movement featured elements of anti-psychologism in the historiography of philosophy.

====Young Hegelians====
The Young Hegelians drew on Hegel&#x27;s idea that the purpose and promise of history was the total negation of everything conducive to restricting freedom and reason; and they proceeded to mount radical critiques, first of religion and then of the Prussian political system. They felt Hegel&#x27;s apparent belief in the end of history conflicted with other aspects of his thought and that, contrary to his later thought, the dialectic was certainly &quot;not&quot; complete; this they felt was obvious given the irrationality of religious beliefs and the empirical lack of freedoms—especially political and religious freedoms—in existing Prussian society. They rejected anti-utopian aspects of his thought that &quot;Old Hegelians&quot; have interpreted to mean that the world has already essentially reached perfection. They included Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–72), David Strauss (1808–74), Bruno Bauer (1809–82) and Max Stirner (1806–56) among their ranks.

Karl Marx (1818–83) often attended their meetings. He developed an interest in Hegelianism, French socialism, and British economic theory. He transformed the three into an essential work of economics called &quot;Das Kapital&quot;, which consisted of a critical economic examination of capitalism. Marxism became one of the major forces on twentieth century world history.

It is important to note that the groups were not as unified or as self-conscious as the labels &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;left&#x27; make them appear. The term &#x27;Right Hegelian&#x27;, for example, was never actually used by those to whom it was later ascribed, namely, Hegel&#x27;s direct successors at the Fredrick William University (now the Humboldt University of Berlin). (The term was first used by David Strauss to describe Bruno Bauer—who actually was a typically &#x27;Left&#x27;, or Young, Hegelian.)

===Friedrich Engels===

Friedrich Engels, also a Young Hegelian originally, was a friend and associate of Marx, together with whom he developed the theory of scientific socialism (communism) and the doctrines of dialectical and historical materialism. His major works include &quot;The Holy Family&quot; (together with Marx, 1844) criticizing the Young Hegelians, &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England&quot; (1845), a study of the deprived conditions of the working class in Manchester and Salford based on Engels&#x27;s personal observations, &quot;The Peasant War in Germany&quot; (1850), an account of the early 16th-century uprising known as the German Peasants&#x27; War with a comparison with the recent revolutionary uprisings of 1848–1849 across Europe, &quot;Anti-Dühring&quot; (1878) criticizing the philosophy of Eugen Dühring, &quot;&quot; (1880) studying the utopian socialists Charles Fourier and Robert Owen and their differences with Engels&#x27; version of socialism, &quot;Dialectics of Nature&quot; (1883) applying Marxist ideas, particularly those of dialectical materialism, to science, and &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot; (1884) arguing that the family is an ever-changing institution that has been shaped by capitalism. It contains an historical view of the family in relation to issues of class, female subjugation and private property.

===Dietzgen===
Joseph Dietzgen was a German leatherworker and social democrat, who independently developed a number of questions of philosophy and came to conclusions very close to the dialectical materialism of Marx and Engels. After the revolution of 1848 he emigrated to America and in 1864 in search of work, he went to Russia. Working in a tannery in St. Petersburg, Dietzgen devoted all his leisure time to works in the field of philosophy, political economy and socialism. In Russia he wrote a large philosophical treatise, &quot;The Essence of the Mental Labor of Man&quot;, a review of the first volume of &quot;Capital&quot; by Karl Marx. In 1869 Dietzgen returned to Germany, and then moved again to America, where he wrote his philosophical works &quot;Excursions of a Socialist in the Field of the Theory of Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Acquisition of Philosophy&quot;.

Marx highly appreciated Dietzgen as a thinker. Noting a number of mistakes and confusion in his views, Marx wrote that Dietzgen expressed “many excellent thoughts, and as a product of the independent thinking of a worker, worthy of amazement.” Engels gave Dietzgen the same high assessment. “And it is remarkable,” wrote Engels, “that we were not alone in discovering this materialistic dialectic, which for many years now has been our best tool of labor and our sharpest weapon; the German worker Joseph Dietzgen rediscovered it independently of us and even independently of Hegel.”

===The &quot;academic socialists&quot;===
The &quot;Kathedersozialismus&quot; movement (academic socialism) was a theoretical and political trend that arose in the second half of the 19th century in German universities. The “academic socialists” – mostly economists and sociologists belonging to the “Historical School” – tried to prove that a people’s state could be built in Prussian Germany through reform, without the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and of the state, thus rejecting the Marxist notion of class struggle. In 1872 the &quot;Kathedersozialisten&quot; formed in Germany the &quot;Union of Social Policy&quot;. Their ideas were similar to those of the Fabian socialists in Britain.

“Academic socialism” supported a variation of Otto von Bismarck’s welfare state. The most notable “academic socialists” in Germany were Bruno Hildebrand, who was openly against Marx and Engels, Gustav von Schmoller, Adolph Wagner, Lujo Brentano, Johann Plenge, Hans Delbrück, Ferdinand Toennies and Werner Sombart. In the labor movement in Germany, their line was supported by Ferdinand Lassalle.

===Dühring===
Eugen Dühring was a German professor of mechanics, philosopher and economist. In philosophy he was an eclectic who combined positivism, mechanistic materialism and idealism. He criticized the views of Friedrich Engels. Dühring’s views on philosophy, political economy and socialism found support among some Social Democrats, in particular by Eduard Bernstein. Engels dedicated his entire book &quot;Anti-Dühring&quot; to criticizing Dühring&#x27;s views.

===Schopenhauer===
An idiosyncratic opponent of German idealism, particularly Hegel&#x27;s thought, was Arthur Schopenhauer (1788 –1860). He was influenced by Eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism, and was known for his pessimism. Schopenhauer&#x27;s most influential work, &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; (1818), claimed that the world is fundamentally what we recognize in ourselves as our will. His analysis of will led him to the conclusion that emotional, physical, and sexual desires can never be fulfilled. Consequently, he eloquently described a lifestyle of negating desires, similar to the ascetic teachings of Vedanta and the Desert Fathers of early Christianity.

Towards the end of Schopenhauer&#x27;s life and in the years after his death, post-Schopenhauerian pessimism became a rather popular &quot;trend&quot; in 19th century Germany. Nevertheless, it was viewed with disdain by the other popular philosophies at the time, such as Hegelianism, materialism, neo-Kantianism, and the emerging positivism. In an age of upcoming revolutions and exciting new discoveries in science, the resigned and a-progressive nature of the typical pessimist was seen as detriment to social development. To respond to this growing criticism, a group of philosophers greatly influenced by Schopenhauer such as Julius Bahnsen (1830–81), Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann (1842–1906), Philipp Mainländer (1841–76), and even some of his personal acquaintances developed their own brand of pessimism, each in their own unique way.

===Mainländer===
Working in the metaphysical framework of Schopenhauer, Philipp Mainländer sees the &quot;will&quot; as the innermost core of being, the ontological arche. However, he deviates from Schopenhauer in important respects. With Schopenhauer the will is singular, unified and beyond time and space. Schopenhauer&#x27;s transcendental idealism leads him to conclude that we only have access to a certain aspect of the thing-in-itself by introspective observation of our own bodies. What we observe as will is all there is to observe, nothing more. There are no hidden aspects. Furthermore, via introspection we can only observe our &quot;individual&quot; will. This also leads Mainländer to the philosophical position of pluralism.

Additionally, Mainländer accentuates on the idea of salvation for all of creation. This is yet another respect in which he differentiates his philosophy from that of Schopenhauer. With Schopenhauer, the silencing of the will is a rare event. The artistic genius can achieve this state temporarily, while only a few saints have achieved total cessation throughout history. For Mainländer, the entirety of the cosmos is slowly but surely moving towards the silencing of the will-to-live and to (as he calls it) &quot;redemption&quot;.

===Neo-Kantianism===

Neo-Kantianism refers broadly to a revived type of philosophy along the lines of that laid down by Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, or more specifically by Schopenhauer&#x27;s criticism of the Kantian philosophy in his work &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, as well as by other post-Kantian philosophers such as Jakob Friedrich Fries (1773–1843) and Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776–1841).

The neo-Kantian schools tended to emphasize scientific readings of Kant, often downplaying the role of intuition in favour of concepts. However, the ethical aspects of neo-Kantian thought often drew them within the orbit of socialism, and they had an important influence on Austromarxism and the revisionism of Eduard Bernstein. The neo-Kantian school was of importance in devising a division of philosophy that has had durable influence well beyond Germany. It made early use of terms such as epistemology and upheld its prominence over ontology. By 1933 (after the rise of Nazism), the various neo-Kantian circles in Germany had dispersed.

===Nietzsche===

Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was initially a proponent of Schopenhauer. However, he soon came to disavow Schopenhauer&#x27;s pessimistic outlook on life and sought to provide a positive philosophy. He believed this task to be urgent, as he believed a form of nihilism caused by modernity was spreading across Europe, which he summed up in the phrase &quot;God is dead&quot;. His problem, then, was how to live a positive life considering that if you believe in God, you give in to dishonesty and cruel beliefs (e.g., divine predestination of some individuals to Hell), and if you don&#x27;t believe in God, you give in to nihilism. He believed he found his solution in the concepts of the Übermensch and Eternal Recurrence. His work continues to have a major influence on both philosophers and artists.

===Mach and Avenarius===

Ernst Mach was an Austrian physicist and philosopher. Mach’s philosophy is set forth in his works &quot;Analysis of Sensations&quot; (1885), &quot;Cognition and Delusion&quot; (1905), and others. Mach viewed things as “complexes of sensations,” denying the existence of an external world independent of human consciousness. The philosophy of Machism found support among Western European Marxists such as Friedrich Adler and Otto Bauer, and in Russia among a part of the Bolshevik intelligentsia (Alexander Bogdanov, Vladimir Bazarov, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Pavel Yushkevich, Nikolai Valentinov etc.). Machian views were also widespread among early 20th century Western physicists, including most notably Albert Einstein.
Richard Avenarius was a German philosopher and one of the founders of empirio-criticism. According to Avenarius, consciousness and being, subject and object (&quot;I&quot; and &quot;environment&quot;) are in constant, obligatory connection (&quot;fundamental coordination&quot;); there is no being without consciousness, there is no consciousness without being. But Avenarius considered consciousness to be the basis of this connection. According to Avenarius, a thing cannot exist independently of consciousness, without a thinking subject.

Vladimir Lenin dedicated his entire book &quot;Materialism and Empirio-Criticism&quot; (1909) to the criticism of the philosophical views of Mach and Avenarius, writing that &quot;this philosophy serves the clergy, serves the same purposes as the philosophy of Berkeley and Hume.&quot;

==20th century==
===Neo-Hegelianism===

Neo-Hegelianism, also known as Post-Hegelianism, was a trend developing in the early 20th century, mostly but not exclusively in Germany. Important German neo-Hegelians include Richard Kroner, Siegfried Marck, Arthur Liebert, and Hermann Glockner, while the Frankfurt School can also be said to have been influenced by neo-Hegelianism.

===Spengler===

Oswald Spengler was a German historian and philosopher of history whose interests included mathematics, science, and art and their relation to his organic theory of history. The main work of Spengler, setting out his philosophy of history, &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;, was published shortly after the defeat of Imperial Germany in World War I. In this work, Spengler predicts the inevitable collapse of the capitalist civilization, which he identifies with European culture. Spengler’s philosophy is imbued with elitism and a dislike for democracy. He declared the workers (the “fourth estate”) to be “outside of culture,” “outside of history”; the mass, Spengler wrote, is the end of everything, “radical nothing.” Spengler praised the “Old Prussian spirit,” the monarchy, the nobility and militarism. For him, war is “an eternal form of higher human existence.”

Spengler’s philosophy of history” is based on the denial of scientific knowledge. The historical researcher, in his opinion, is the more significant, the less he belongs to science. Spengler opposes intuition to logical, rational knowledge, denying the principle of causality and regularity in social life. Spengler rejects the possibility of knowing objective truth, defending absolute relativism. Along with historical regularity, Spengler rejects the concept of historical progress, tries to prove the meaninglessness of history and the absence of development in it. Spengler contrasts the scientific understanding of natural historical development with historical fatalism – predestination, “destiny.” Spengler also denies the unity of world history. His history breaks down into a number of completely independent, unique “cultures,” special organisms above and beyond, having an individual destiny and experiencing periods of emergence, flourishing and dying.

Spengler reduces the task of the philosophy of history to comprehending the “morphological structure” of each “culture,” which supposedly is based on the “soul of culture.” According to Spengler, Western European culture entered a stage of decline already starting from the 19th century, that is, with the victory of capitalism; the period of its heyday was the era of feudalism. In his work &quot;Preussentum und Sozialismus&quot; Spengler advances the idea of “German socialism” against “Marxist socialism”. It has been argued that Spengler&#x27;s ideas had an influence on Hitler and Nazism. A philosophy of history close to Spenglerian views was promoted after the Second World War by the English historian Arnold Toynbee.

===Analytic philosophy===

====Frege, Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle====
In the late 19th century, the predicate logic of Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) made the first substantial advance over Aristotelian logic since its inception in Ancient Greece. This was the beginning of analytic philosophy. In the early part of the 20th century, a group of German and Austrian philosophers and scientists formed the Vienna Circle to promote scientific thought over Hegelian system-building, which they saw as a bad influence on intellectual thought. The group considered themselves logical positivists because they believed all knowledge is either derived through experience or arrived at through analytic statements, and they adopted the predicate logic of Frege, as well as the early work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) as foundations to their work.

===Continental philosophy===

While some of the seminal philosophers of twentieth-century analytical philosophy were German-speakers, most German-language philosophy of the twentieth century tends to be defined not as analytical but &#x27;continental&#x27; philosophy – as befits Germany&#x27;s position as part of the European &#x27;continent&#x27; as opposed to the British Isles or other culturally European nations outside of Europe.

====Phenomenology====
Phenomenology began at the start of the 20th century with the descriptive psychology of Franz Brentano (1838–1917), and then the transcendental phenomenology of Edmund Husserl (1859–1938). Max Scheler (1874–1928) further developed the philosophical method of phenomenology. It was then transformed by Martin Heidegger (1889–1976), whose famous book &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927) applied phenomenology to ontology, and who, along with Ludwig Wittgenstein, is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Phenomenology has had a large influence on Continental Philosophy, particularly existentialism and poststructuralism. Heidegger himself is often identified as an existentialist, though he rejected this.

====Hermeneutics====

Hermeneutics is the philosophical theory and practice of interpretation and understanding.

Originally hermeneutics referred to the interpretation of texts, especially religious texts. In the 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) and others expanded the discipline of hermeneutics beyond mere exegesis and turned it into a general humanistic discipline. Schleiermacher wondered whether there could be a hermeneutics that was not a collection of pieces of ad hoc advice for the solution of specific problems with text interpretation but rather a &quot;general hermeneutics,&quot; which dealt with the &quot;art of understanding&quot; as such, which pertained to the structure and function of understanding wherever it occurs. Later in the 19th century, Dilthey began to see possibilities for continuing Schleiermacher&#x27;s general hermeneutics project as a &quot;general methodology of the humanities and social sciences&quot;.

In the 20th century, hermeneutics took an &#x27;ontological turn&#x27;. Martin Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Being and Time&quot; fundamentally transformed the discipline. No longer was it conceived of as being about understanding linguistic communication, or providing a methodological basis for the human sciences – as far as Heidegger was concerned, hermeneutics is ontology, dealing with the most fundamental conditions of man&#x27;s being in the world. The Heideggerian conception of hermeneutics was further developed by Heidegger&#x27;s pupil Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–2002), in his book &quot;Truth and Method&quot;.

====Frankfurt School====
In 1923, Carl Grünberg founded the Institute for Social Research, drawing from Marxism, Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis, and Weberian philosophy, which came to be known as the &quot;Frankfurt School&quot;. Expelled by the Nazis, the school reformed again in Frankfurt after World War II. Although they drew from Marxism, they were outspoken opponents of Stalinism. Books from the group, like Adorno’s and Horkheimer’s &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; and Adorno’s &quot;Negative Dialectics&quot;, critiqued what they saw as the failure of the Enlightenment project and the problems of modernity.

Since the 1960s, the Frankfurt School has been guided by Jürgen Habermas&#x27; (born 1929) work on communicative reason and linguistic intersubjectivity.

<text>Molecular evolution describes how inherited DNA and/or RNA change over evolutionary time, and the consequences of this for proteins and other components of cells and organisms. Molecular evolution is the basis of phylogenetic approaches to describing the tree of life. Molecular evolution overlaps with population genetics, especially on shorter timescales. Topics in molecular evolution include the origins of new genes, the genetic nature of complex traits, the genetic basis of adaptation and speciation, the evolution of development, and patterns and processes underlying genomic changes during evolution.

==History==
The history of molecular evolution starts in the early 20th century with comparative biochemistry, and the use of &quot;fingerprinting&quot; methods such as immune assays, gel electrophoresis, and paper chromatography in the 1950s to explore homologous proteins. The advent of protein sequencing allowed molecular biologists to create phylogenies based on sequence comparison, and to use the differences between homologous sequences as a molecular clock to estimate the time since the most recent common ancestor. The surprisingly large amount of molecular divergence within and between species inspired the neutral theory of molecular evolution in the late 1960s. Neutral theory also provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock, although this is not needed for the clock&#x27;s validity. After the 1970s, nucleic acid sequencing allowed molecular evolution to reach beyond proteins to highly conserved ribosomal RNA sequences, the foundation of a reconceptualization of the early history of life. The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution was founded in 1982.

==Molecular phylogenetics==


Molecular phylogenetics uses DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to resolve questions in systematics, i.e. about their correct scientific classification from the point of view of evolutionary history. The result of a molecular phylogenetic analysis is expressed in a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic inference is conducted using data from DNA sequencing. This is aligned to identify which sites are homologous. A substitution model describes what patterns are expected to be common or rare. Sophisticated computational inference is then used to generate one or more plausible trees.

Some phylogenetic methods account for variation among sites and among tree branches. Different genes, e.g. hemoglobin vs. cytochrome c, generally evolve at different rates. These rates are relatively constant over time (e.g., hemoglobin does not evolve at the same rate as cytochrome c, but hemoglobins from humans, mice, etc. do have comparable rates of evolution), although rapid evolution along one branch can indicate increased directional selection on that branch. Purifying selection causes functionally important regions to evolve more slowly, and amino acid substitutions involving similar amino acids occurs more often than dissimilar substitutions.

==Gene family evolution==


Gene duplication can produce multiple homologous proteins (paralogs) within the same species. Phylogenetic analysis of proteins has revealed how proteins evolve and change their structure and function over time.

For example, ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) has evolved a multitude of structural and functional variants. Class I RNRs use a ferritin subunit and differ by the metal they use as cofactors. In class II RNRs, the thiyl radical is generated using an adenosylcobalamin cofactor and these enzymes do not require additional subunits (as opposed to class I which do). In class III RNRs, the thiyl radical is generated using S-adenosylmethionine bound to a 4Fe-4S] cluster. That is, within a single family of proteins numerous structural and functional mechanisms can evolve.

In a proof-of-concept study, Bhattacharya and colleagues converted myoglobin, a non-enzymatic oxygen storage protein, into a highly efficient Kemp eliminase using only three mutations. This demonstrates that only few mutations are needed to radically change the function of a protein. Directed evolution is the attempt to engineer proteins using methods inspired by molecular evolution.

==Molecular evolution at one site==

Change at one locus begins with a new mutation, which might become fixed due to some combination of natural selection, genetic drift, and gene conversion.

===Mutation===

Mutations are permanent, transmissible changes to the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of a cell or virus. Mutations result from errors in DNA replication during cell division and by exposure to radiation, chemicals, other environmental stressors, viruses, or transposable elements. When point mutations to just one base-pair of the DNA fall within a region coding for a protein, they are characterized by whether they are synonymous (do not change the amino acid sequence) or non-synonymous. Other types of mutations modify larger segments of DNA and can cause duplications, insertions, deletions, inversions, and translocations.

The distribution of rates for diverse kinds of mutations is called the &quot;mutation spectrum&quot; (see App. B of ). Mutations of different types occur at widely varying rates. Point mutation rates for most organisms are very low, roughly 10−9 to 10−8 per site per generation, though some viruses have higher mutation rates on the order of 10−6 per site per generation. Transitions (A ↔ G or C ↔ T) are more common than transversions (purine (adenine or guanine)) ↔ pyrimidine (cytosine or thymine, or in RNA, uracil)). Perhaps the most common type of mutation in humans is a change in the length of a short tandem repeat (e.g., the CAG repeats underlying various disease-associated mutations). Such STR mutations may occur at rates on the order of 10−3 per generation.

Different frequencies of different types of mutations can play an important role in evolution via bias in the introduction of variation (arrival bias), contributing to parallelism, trends, and differences in the navigability of adaptive landscapes. Mutation bias makes systematic or predictable contributions to parallel evolution. Since the 1960s, genomic GC content has been thought to reflect mutational tendencies. Mutational biases also contribute to codon usage bias. Although such hypotheses are often associated with neutrality, recent theoretical and empirical results have established that mutational tendencies can influence both neutral and adaptive evolution via bias in the introduction of variation (arrival bias).

===Selection===

Selection can occur when an allele confers greater fitness, i.e. greater ability to survive or reproduce, on the average individual than carries it. A selectionist approach emphasizes e.g. that biases in codon usage are due at least in part to the ability of even weak selection to shape molecular evolution.

Selection can also operate at the gene level at the expense of organismal fitness, resulting in intragenomic conflict. This is because there can be a selective advantage for selfish genetic elements in spite of a host cost. Examples of such selfish elements include transposable elements, meiotic drivers, and selfish mitochondria.

Selection can be detected using the Ka/Ks ratio, the McDonald–Kreitman test. Rapid adaptive evolution is often found for genes involved in intragenomic conflict, sexual antagonistic coevolution, and the immune system.

===Genetic drift===

Genetic drift is the change of allele frequencies from one generation to the next due to stochastic effects of random sampling in finite populations. These effects can accumulate until a mutation becomes fixed in a population. For neutral mutations, the rate of fixation per generation is equal to the mutation rate per replication. A relatively constant mutation rate thus produces a constant rate of change per generation (molecular clock).

Slightly deleterious mutations with a selection coefficient less than a threshold value of 1 / the effective population size can also fix. Many genomic features have been ascribed to accumulation of nearly neutral detrimental mutations as a result of small effective population sizes. With a smaller effective population size, a larger variety of mutations will behave as if they are neutral due to inefficiency of selection.

===Gene conversion===

Gene conversion occurs during recombination, when nucleotide damage is repaired using an homologous genomic region as a template. It can be a biased process, i.e. one allele may have a higher probability of being the donor than the other in a gene conversion event. In particular, GC-biased gene conversion tends to increase the GC-content of genomes, particularly in regions with higher recombination rates. There is also evidence for GC bias in the mismatch repair process. It is thought that this may be an adaptation to the high rate of methyl-cytosine deamination which can lead to C→T transitions.

The dynamics of biased gene conversion resemble those of natural selection, in that a favored allele will tend to increase exponentially in frequency when rare.

==Genome architecture==
===Genome size===

Genome size is influenced by the amount of repetitive DNA as well as number of genes in an organism. Some organisms, such as most bacteria, &quot;Drosophila&quot;, and &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; have particularly compact genomes with little repetitive content or non-coding DNA. Other organisms, like mammals or maize, have large amounts of repetitive DNA, long introns, and substantial spacing between genes. The C-value paradox refers to the lack of correlation between organism &#x27;complexity&#x27; and genome size. Explanations for the so-called paradox are two-fold. First, repetitive genetic elements can comprise large portions of the genome for many organisms, thereby inflating DNA content of the haploid genome. Repetitive genetic elements are often descended from transposable elements.

Secondly, the number of genes is not necessarily indicative of the number of developmental stages or tissue types in an organism. An organism with few developmental stages or tissue types may have large numbers of genes that influence non-developmental phenotypes, inflating gene content relative to developmental gene families.

Neutral explanations for genome size suggest that when population sizes are small, many mutations become nearly neutral. Hence, in small populations repetitive content and other &#x27;junk&#x27; DNA can accumulate without placing the organism at a competitive disadvantage. There is little evidence to suggest that genome size is under strong widespread selection in multicellular eukaryotes. Genome size, independent of gene content, correlates poorly with most physiological traits and many eukaryotes, including mammals, harbor very large amounts of repetitive DNA.

However, birds likely have experienced strong selection for reduced genome size, in response to changing energetic needs for flight. Birds, unlike humans, produce nucleated red blood cells, and larger nuclei lead to lower levels of oxygen transport. Bird metabolism is far higher than that of mammals, due largely to flight, and oxygen needs are high. Hence, most birds have small, compact genomes with few repetitive elements. Indirect evidence suggests that non-avian theropod dinosaur ancestors of modern birds also had reduced genome sizes, consistent with endothermy and high energetic needs for running speed. Many bacteria have also experienced selection for small genome size, as time of replication and energy consumption are so tightly correlated with fitness.

===Chromosome number and organization===
The ant &quot;Myrmecia pilosula&quot; has only a single pair of chromosomes whereas the Adders-tongue fern &quot;Ophioglossum reticulatum&quot; has up to 1260 chromosomes. The number of chromosomes in an organism&#x27;s genome does not necessarily correlate with the amount of DNA in its genome. The genome-wide amount of recombination is directly controlled by the number of chromosomes, with one crossover per chromosome or per chromosome arm, depending on the species.

Changes in chromosome number can play a key role in speciation, as differing chromosome numbers can serve as a barrier to reproduction in hybrids. Human chromosome 2 was created from a fusion of two chimpanzee chromosomes and still contains central telomeres as well as a vestigial second centromere. Polyploidy, especially allopolyploidy, which occurs often in plants, can also result in reproductive incompatibilities with parental species. &quot;Agrodiatus&quot; blue butterflies have diverse chromosome numbers ranging from n=10 to n=134 and additionally have one of the highest rates of speciation identified to date.

Cilliate genomes house each gene in individual chromosomes.

===Organelles===
In addition to the nuclear genome, endosymbiont organelles contain their own genetic material. Mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA varies across taxa, but membrane-bound proteins, especially electron transport chain constituents are most often encoded in the organelle. Chloroplasts and mitochondria are maternally inherited in most species, as the organelles must pass through the egg. In a rare departure, some species of mussels are known to inherit mitochondria from father to son.

==Origins of new genes==

New genes arise from several different genetic mechanisms including gene duplication, de novo gene birth, retrotransposition, chimeric gene formation, recruitment of non-coding sequence into an existing gene, and gene truncation.

Gene duplication initially leads to redundancy. However, duplicated gene sequences can mutate to develop new functions or specialize so that the new gene performs a subset of the original ancestral functions. Retrotransposition duplicates genes by copying mRNA to DNA and inserting it into the genome. Retrogenes generally insert into new genomic locations, lack introns. and sometimes develop new expression patterns and functions.

Chimeric genes form when duplication, deletion, or incomplete retrotransposition combine portions of two different coding sequences to produce a novel gene sequence. Chimeras often cause regulatory changes and can shuffle protein domains to produce novel adaptive functions.

&quot;De novo&quot; gene birth can give rise to protein-coding genes and non-coding genes from previously non-functional DNA. For instance, Levine and colleagues reported the origin of five new genes in the &quot;D. melanogaster&quot; genome. Similar de novo origin of genes has been also shown in other organisms such as yeast, rice and humans. De novo genes may evolve from spurious transcripts that are already expressed at low levels.

==Constructive neutral evolution==
Constructive neutral evolution (CNE) explains that complex systems can emerge and spread into a population through neutral transitions with the principles of excess capacity, presuppression, and ratcheting, and it has been applied in areas ranging from the origins of the spliceosome to the complex interdependence of microbial communities.

==Journals and societies==
The Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution publishes the journals &quot;Molecular Biology and Evolution&quot; and &quot;Genome Biology and Evolution&quot; and holds an annual international meeting. Other journals dedicated to molecular evolution include &quot;Journal of Molecular Evolution&quot; and &quot;Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution&quot;. Research in molecular evolution is also published in journals of genetics, molecular biology, genomics, systematics, and evolutionary biology.

<text>In photography, angle of view (AOV) describes the angular extent of a given scene that is imaged by a camera. It is used interchangeably with the more general term &quot;field of view&quot;.

It is important to distinguish the angle of view from the angle of coverage, which describes the angle range that a lens can image on a given image sensor or film location (the image plane). In other words, the angle of coverage is determined by the lens and the image plane while the angle of view (AOV) is decided by not only them but also the film or image sensor size. The image circle (giving the angle of coverage) produced by a lens on a given image plane is typically large enough to completely cover a film or sensor at the plane, possibly including some vignetting toward the edge. If the angle of coverage of the lens does not fill the sensor, the image circle will be visible, typically with strong vignetting toward the edge, and the effective angle of view will be limited to the angle of coverage.


As abovementioned, a camera&#x27;s angle of view depends not only on the lens, but also on the image sensor or film. Digital sensors are usually smaller than 35 mm film, and this causes the lens to have a narrower angle of view than with 35 mm film, by a constant factor for each sensor (called the crop factor). In everyday digital cameras, the crop factor can range from around 1, called full frame (professional digital SLRs where the sensor size is similar to the 35 mm film), to 1.6 (consumer SLR), to 2 (Micro Four Thirds ILC), and to 6 (most compact cameras). So, a standard 50 mm lens for 35 mm film photography acts like a 50 mm standard &quot;film&quot; lens on a professional digital SLR (with crop factor = 1) and would act closer to an 80 mm lens (= 1.6 × 50 mm) on many mid-market DSLRs (with crop factor = 1.6). Similarly, the 40-degree angle of view of a standard 50 mm lens on a 35 mm film camera is equivalent to an 80 mm lens on many digital SLRs (again, crop factor = 1.6).

== Calculating a camera&#x27;s angle of view ==

For lenses projecting rectilinear (non-spatially distorted) images of distant objects, the effective focal length and the image format dimensions completely define the angle of view. Calculations for lenses producing non-rectilinear images are much more complex and, in the end, not very useful in most practical applications. (In the case of a lens with distortion, e.g., a fisheye lens, a longer lens with distortion can have a wider angle of view than a shorter lens with low distortion) Angle of view may be measured horizontally (from the left to right edge of the frame), vertically (from the top to bottom of the frame), or diagonally (from one corner of the frame to its opposite corner).

For a lens projecting a rectilinear image (focused at infinity, see derivation), the angle of view (&quot;α&quot;) can be calculated from the chosen dimension (&quot;d&quot;), and effective focal length (&quot;f&quot;) (&quot;f&quot; is defined as the distance of the lens with respect to the image plane. For a thick lens, it is the distance of the rear principal plane of the lens w.r.t the image plane) as follows:

formula_1

formula_2 represents the size of the film (or sensor) in the direction measured &quot;(see below: sensor effects)&quot;. For example, for 35 mm film which is 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, formula_3 would be used to obtain the horizontal angle of view and formula_4 for the vertical angle.

Because this is a trigonometric function, the angle of view does not vary quite linearly with the reciprocal of the focal length. However, except for wide-angle lenses, it is reasonable to approximate formula_5 radians or formula_6 degrees.

The effective focal length is nearly equal to the stated focal length of the lens (&quot;F&quot;), except in macro photography where the lens-to-object distance is comparable to the focal length. In this case, the absolute transverse magnification factor (&quot;m&quot;) (formula_7) must be taken into account:

formula_8

(In photography, the magnification is usually defined to be positive, despite the inverted image.) For example, with a magnification ratio of 1:2, we find formula_9 and thus the angle of view is reduced by 33% compared to focusing on a distant object with the same lens.

Angle of view can also be determined using FOV tables or paper or software lens calculators.

=== Example ===

Consider a 35 mm camera with a lens having a focal length of . The dimensions of the 35 mm image format are 24 mm (vertically) × 36 mm (horizontal), giving a diagonal of about 43.3 mm.

At infinity focus, , the angles of view are:
* horizontally, formula_10
* vertically, formula_11
* diagonally, formula_12

=== Derivation of the angle-of-view formula ===

Consider a rectilinear lens in a camera used to photograph an object at a distance formula_13, and forming an image that just barely fits in the dimension, formula_2, of the frame (the film or image sensor). Treat the lens as if it were a pinhole at distance formula_15 from the image plane (technically, the center of perspective of a rectilinear lens is at the center of its entrance pupil where chief rays meet):

Now formula_16 is the angle between the optical axis of the lens and the ray joining its optical center to the edge of the film. Here formula_17 is defined to be the angle-of-view, since it is the angle enclosing the largest object whose image can fit on the film. We want to find the relationship between:
* the angle formula_17
* the &quot;opposite&quot; side of the right triangle, formula_19 (half the film-format dimension)
* the &quot;adjacent&quot; side, formula_15 (distance from the lens to the image plane)
Using basic trigonometry, we find:formula_21which we can solve for &quot;α&quot;, giving:

formula_22

To project a sharp image of distant objects, formula_15 needs to be equal to the focal length, formula_24, which is attained by setting the lens for infinity focus. Then the angle of view is given by:

formula_25

Note that the angle of view varies slightly when the focus is not at infinity (See breathing (lens)), given by formula_26 as a rearrangement of the lens equation.

==== Macro photography ====

For macro photography, we cannot neglect the difference between formula_15 and formula_24. From the lens formula,

formula_29

The absolute transverse magnification (the absolute ratio of the image height to the object height) can be expressed formula_7, we can substitute formula_13 and with some algebra find:

formula_32

Defining formula_33 as the &quot;effective focal length&quot;, we get the formula presented above:

formula_1 where formula_35.

A second effect which comes into play in macro photography is lens asymmetry (an asymmetric lens is a lens where the aperture appears to have different dimensions when viewed from the front and from the back). The lens asymmetry causes an offset between the nodal plane and pupil positions. The effect can be quantified using the ratio (&quot;P&quot;) between apparent exit pupil diameter and entrance pupil diameter. The full formula for angle of view now becomes:

formula_36

== Measuring a camera&#x27;s field of view ==
In the optical instrumentation industry the term &quot;field of view&quot; (FOV) is most often used, though the measurements are still expressed as angles. Optical tests are commonly used for measuring the FOV of UV, visible, and infrared (wavelengths about 0.1–20 μm in the electromagnetic spectrum) sensors and cameras.

The purpose of this test is to measure the horizontal and vertical FOV of a lens and sensor used in an imaging system, when the lens focal length or sensor size is not known (that is, when the calculation above is not immediately applicable). Although this is one typical method that the optics industry uses to measure the FOV, there exist many other possible methods.

UV/visible light from an integrating sphere (and/or other source such as a black body) is focused onto a square test target at the focal plane of a collimator (the mirrors in the diagram), such that a virtual image of the test target will be seen infinitely far away by the camera under test. The camera under test senses a real image of the virtual image of the target, and the sensed image is displayed on a monitor.

The sensed image, which includes the target, is displayed on a monitor, where it can be measured. Dimensions of the full image display and of the portion of the image that is the target are determined by inspection (measurements are typically in pixels, but can just as well be inches or cm).

*formula_37 = dimension of full image
*formula_2 = dimension of image of target

The collimator&#x27;s distant virtual image of the target subtends a certain angle, referred to as the angular extent of the target, that depends on the collimator focal length and the target size. Assuming the sensed image includes the whole target, the angle seen by the camera, its FOV, is this angular extent of the target times the ratio of full image size to target image size.

The target&#x27;s angular extent is:

formula_39

where formula_40 is the dimension of the target and formula_41 is the focal length of collimator.

The total field of view is then approximately:

formula_42

or more precisely, if the imaging system is rectilinear:

formula_43

This calculation could be a horizontal or a vertical FOV, depending on how the target and image are measured.

== Lens types and effects ==

=== Focal length ===
Lenses are often referred to by terms that express their angle of view:
*Fisheye lenses, typical focal lengths are between 8 mm and 10 mm for circular images, and 15–16 mm for full-frame images. Up to 180° and beyond.
**A circular fisheye lens (as opposed to a full-frame fisheye) is an example of a lens where the angle of coverage is less than the angle of view. The image projected onto the film is circular because the diameter of the image projected is &quot;narrower&quot; than that needed to cover the widest portion of the film.
*Ultra wide angle lens is a rectilinear which is less than 24 mm of focal length in 35 mm film format, here 14 mm gives 114° and 24 mm gives 84° .
* Wide-angle lenses (24–35 mm in 35 mm film format) cover between 84° and 64°
* Normal, or Standard lenses (36–60 mm in 35 mm film format) cover between 62° and 40°
* Long focus lenses (any lens with a focal length greater than the diagonal of the film or sensor used) generally have an angle of view of 35° or less. Since photographers usually only encounter the telephoto lens sub-type, they are referred to in common photographic parlance as:
* &quot;Medium telephoto&quot;, a focal length of 85 mm to 250 mm in 35 mm film format covering between 30° and 10°
* &quot;Super telephoto&quot; (over 300 mm in 35 mm film format) generally cover between 8° through less than 1°

Zoom lenses are a special case wherein the focal length, and hence angle of view, of the lens can be altered mechanically without removing the lens from the camera.

=== Characteristics ===
For a given camera–subject distance, longer lenses magnify the subject more. For a given subject magnification (and thus different camera–subject distances), longer lenses appear to compress distance; wider lenses appear to expand the distance between objects.

Another result of using a wide angle lens is a greater apparent perspective distortion when the camera is not aligned perpendicularly to the subject: parallel lines converge at the same rate as with a normal lens, but converge more due to the wider total field. For example, buildings appear to be falling backwards much more severely when the camera is pointed upward from ground level than they would if photographed with a normal lens at the same distance from the subject, because more of the subject building is visible in the wide-angle shot.

Because different lenses generally require a different camera–subject distance to preserve the size of a subject, changing the angle of view can indirectly distort perspective, changing the apparent relative size of the subject and foreground.

If the subject image size remains the same, then at any given aperture all lenses, wide angle and long lenses, will give the same depth of field.

=== Examples ===

An example of how lens choice affects angle of view.

== Common lens angles of view ==

This table shows the diagonal, horizontal, and vertical angles of view, in degrees, for lenses producing rectilinear images, when used with 36 mm × 24 mm format (that is, 135 film or full-frame 35 mm digital using width 36 mm, height 24 mm, and diagonal 43.3 mm for &quot;d&quot; in the formula above). Digital compact cameras sometimes state the focal lengths of their lenses in 35 mm equivalents, which can be used in this table.

For comparison, the human visual system perceives an angle of view of about 140° by 80°.


== Sensor size effects (&quot;crop factor&quot;) ==
As noted above, a camera&#x27;s angle level of view depends not only on the lens, but also on the sensor used. Digital sensors are usually smaller than 35 mm film, causing the lens to usually behave as a longer focal length lens would behave, and have a narrower angle of view than with 35 mm film, by a constant factor for each sensor (called the crop factor). In everyday digital cameras, the crop factor can range from around 1 (professional digital SLRs), to 1.6 (mid-market SLRs), to around 3 to 6 for compact cameras. So a standard 50 mm lens for 35 mm photography acts like a 50 mm standard &quot;film&quot; lens even on a professional digital SLR, but would act closer to a 75 mm (1.5×50 mm Nikon) or 80 mm lens (1.6×50mm Canon) on many mid-market DSLRs, and the 40-degree angle of view of a standard 50 mm lens on a film camera is equivalent to a 28–35 mm lens on many digital SLRs.

The table below shows the horizontal, vertical and diagonal angles of view, in degrees, when used with 22.2 mm × 14.8 mm format (that is Canon&#x27;s DSLR APS-C frame size) and a diagonal of 26.7 mm.
== Cinematography and video gaming ==
Modifying the angle of view over time (known as zooming), is a frequently used cinematic technique, often combined with camera movement to produce a &quot;dolly zoom&quot; effect, made famous by the film &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Using a wide angle of view can exaggerate the camera&#x27;s perceived speed, and is a common technique in tracking shots, phantom rides, and racing video games.

<doc id="176059" wikidata="Q688121" url="?curid=176059" title="Minox">
<text>Minox (pronounced ) is a manufacturer of cameras, known especially for its subminiature camera.

The first product to carry the Minox name was a subminiature camera, conceived in 1922, and finally produced in 1936, by Baltic German Walter Zapp. The Latvian factory VEF (&quot;Valsts elektrotehniskā fabrika&quot;) manufactured the camera from 1937 to 1943. After World War II, the camera was redesigned and production resumed in Germany in 1948. Zapp originally envisioned the Minox to be a camera for everyone requiring only little photographic knowledge. Yet in part due to its high manufacturing costs, the Minox became more well known as a must-have luxury item. From the start the Minox also gained wide notoriety as a spy camera.

Minox branched out into 35 mm film format and 110 film format cameras in 1974 and 1976, respectively. Minox continues to operate today, producing or branding optical and photographic equipment.

==History==
From 1936 to 1975, the history of the Minox brand is essentially that of the Minox subminiature camera. From 1975 the Minox name also became associated with other products, most notably the Minox 35 mm compact cameras produced from 1975 until 2004.

Minox was acquired by Leica in 1996, but a management buyout on 25 August 2001 left Minox an independent company again.

==Minox subminiature camera==
===Subminiature camera history===
The original Minox subminiature camera was invented by Walter Zapp in 1936. Zapp, a Baltic German, was born in 1905 in Riga, then part of the Russian Empire. The family moved to Reval (now called Tallinn, Estonia) where he first took a job as an engraver before finding a position with a photographer. He became friends with Nikolai &#x27;Nixi&#x27; Nylander and Richard Jürgens, and it was through discussions with these friends that the idea of a camera that could always be carried came to him. Nixi Nylander also coined the name &quot;Minox&quot; and drew up the Minox mouse logo. Jürgens funded the original project but was not able to get support in Estonia for production. Jürgens contacted an English representative of the VEF (Valsts Elektrotehniskā Fabrika) electrotechnical manufacturing business in Riga (by then independent Latvia) who then arranged a meeting where Zapp demonstrated the Minox prototype (&quot;Ur&quot;Minox), with a set of enlargements made from Ur-Minox negatives. Production began in Riga at VEF, running from 1937 until 1943. In the same time, VEF had received patent protection on Zapp&#x27;s inventions in at least 18 countries worldwide.

Shortly after its introduction, the Minox was widely advertised in The European and American markets. It did not surmount the popularity of 35 mm cameras (which were then referred to as &quot;Miniature Cameras&quot;), but did achieve a niche market. It also attracted the attention of intelligence agencies in America, Britain and Germany, due to its small size and macro focusing ability.

Ironically during World War II production of the Minox was put in jeopardy several times as Latvia fell victim to invasion by the Soviet Union, then Germany, and then by the Soviets again. Cameras were produced under both Russian and German occupation nevertheless, and the camera became both a luxury gift item for Nazi leaders as well as a tool for their spies. In the meantime, Zapp and his associates protected their interest in the product by searching for alternative production facilities in Germany.


After World War II, production of the Minox II began in 1948 at a new company, Minox GmbH, in Giessen/Heuchelheim near Wetzlar, West Germany. The new camera very much resembled the original, but was made with a plastic chassis covered by an aluminum shell. This greatly reduced its weight and, to an extent, cost. The camera continued to appeal to a luxury &quot;gadget&quot; market which broadened during the 1950s and early 1960s. It also continued to see use as an espionage camera by both sides during the Cold War. During this time, the Minox company continued to develop the camera, working with Gossen to develop a companion miniature exposure meter, as well as improved models such as the Minox B, which incorporated an even smaller Gossen-designed meter into the camera itself. The Minox B became the most popular and widely produced model of the line. Further developments included autoexposure, and the company developed an extensive line of accessories. These included flash guns, viewfinder attachments, tripod mounts, and copying stands, all increasing the camera utility in a variety of applications. One accessory even allowed the camera to use a pair of binoculars as a telephoto lens (see illustration). Limited editions of the camera were also produced in a variety of luxury finishes, such as gold plating. Standard cameras were also available in an optional black anodized finish.

The Riga Minox camera, along with the luxury finish postwar cameras, are now collector&#x27;s items. All-mechanical models A and B remain in use by hobbyists. In 1969 the model C became the first camera of its kind to incorporate electronic exposure control. With the introduction of the LX came significant redesign of the camera&#x27;s basic controls. It was followed by the last production model, the TLX. There was also a fully electronic entry-level model, the EC, which had a very different internal design and a fixed-focus lens. The production rate for these cameras was considerably slower than in former years, however, as high production costs and increasing competition from Japan sharply reduced sales and revenues. 

Beginning in 1981, MINOX experienced increasing difficulties. A quarter of the original 750 employees had to be made redundant. A settlement request was filed with the District Court in Giessen on November 21, 1988. Under the direction of the receivership administration, the workforce was reduced to just under 300, and the business was extensively reorganized.

The MINOX TLX Camera was available until September 2014. Minox is now part of the Blazer Group GmBH, with its facilities in Isny im Allgäu in the south of Germany, with a service facility remaining in Wetzlar. Production of 8x11 film ended in 2015.

The company now produces high-quality sports optics and night-vision devices, its only camera models being trail cameras. 

====Spy camera====
The Minox subminiature camera attracted the attention of intelligence agencies in America, Britain and Germany, and most of the Eastern Bloc (East Germany, Romania) due to its small size and macro focusing ability. There is at least one document in the public record of 25 Minox cameras purchased by the US Office of Strategic Services intelligence organisation in 1942.

The close-focusing lens and small size of the camera made it perfect for covert uses such as surveillance or document copying. The Minox was used by both Axis and Allied intelligence agents during World War II. Later versions were used well into the 1980s. The Soviet spy John A. Walker Jr., whose actions against the US Navy cryptography programs represent some of the most compromising intelligence actions against the United States during the Cold War era, used a Minox C to photograph documents and ciphers.

An measuring chain was provided with most Minox subminiature cameras, which enabled easy copying of letter-sized documents. The espionage use of the Minox has been portrayed in Hollywood movies and TV shows, and some 1980s Minox advertising has played up the &quot;spy camera&quot; story.

====Other special uses====
A Minox B, operated by remote trigger and protected in a special housing, was used to inspect the interior of the United States Army&#x27;s SL-1 experimental nuclear reactor after it experienced an internal steam explosion in 1961. This camera and housing were shown in the film report released following the accident investigation.

===Technical details of Minox 8×11 cameras===


The original Riga-made Minox had a brass chassis covered in a stainless steel shell, which telescopes to reveal or cover the lens and viewfinder windows, as well as to advance the film. It was equipped with a parallax correcting viewfinder, which was coupled to a Cooke triplet type Minostigmat 15 mm f/3.5 lens. The lens was capable of focusing as close as 20 cm, and, due to its small image size, provided such depth of field at full aperture that a diaphragm was deemed unnecessary. The maximum focus zone was about one meter to infinity. In front of the lens was a metal foil curtain shutter, which was itself protected by a window. These were advanced features at the time for any camera, regardless of size.

The dimensions of the Minox subminiature camera are: 80 mm × 27 mm x 16 mm; weight: 130 g.

The Minox cameras project an image of 8×11 mm onto the negative. The film is in strips 9.2 mm wide, or less than one-quarter the size of 35 mm film, and unlike 35 mm film, it has no sprocket holes. This film strip is rolled up in the supply side chamber of a small twin chamber cartridge, with the film leader taped to a take-up spool in the take up chamber. The film strips can be up to 50 frames in length for Riga Minox and Minox II, III, IIIs and B cameras. From Minox BL and C cameras onward the Minox film cartridge holds 15, 30, or 36 exposures.

The VEF Riga has a three-element flat film plane lens. Performance could be improved, so the short-lived Minox II (1948–1951) had a new 5 element lens (called complan) whose final element would rest against the film itself when the pressure plate pushed the film onto the lens. Customers complained of film scratches with this new design, so most of these lenses were replaced by MINOX with the later curved-field compensating lens. Consequently, original &#x27;film lens&#x27; Minox II are exceptional.
Early Minox cameras from Minox A/III to Minox B were equipped with a four-element, three-group Complan (lens) designed by ex-Leica lens designer Arthur Seibert. The Complan lens has a curved film plane, hence in these cameras the negative must be held in an arc to improve the edge-to-edge sharpness of the image. The Minox enlarger also holds the negative in this same curve. Later models, beginning with late model Minox B, to the current model TLX, using the 15 mm f/3.5 four-element, three-group flat-field Minox lens, holds the negative flat. The advance was attributed by Rolf Kasemeier (Small MINOX Big Pictures 1971 edition) to new rare-earth element, high-index, low-dispersion, optical glasses becoming available (probably from Schott Glass, of Jena). Note that lens performance between old and new complan/minox lenses was rated by MINOX themselves as identical.

At this time to differentiate between negatives taken with the older complan lens and negatives taken with the later minox lens, MINOX introduced an edge code in the negative. Since the MINOX C (the first camera released with the new minox lens) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera. The reason was that commercial processors used MINOX enlargers. As the minox lens replaced the complan, so the enlargers had to change lenses: MINOX II enlargers were curved negative track and complan lenses, MINOX III enlargers were straight negative track and minox lenses. Ironically, owners of Rigas and model II cameras would get better results from a MINOX III enlarger than a MINOX II enlarger.

The early Minox cameras from Riga to Minox B, BL and AX, were equipped with a mechanical shutter, while later model Minox ( C, LX, EC, TLX ) cameras have an electromagnetic shutter. When closed, the viewfinder and lens windows are protected. Complan lens and Minox lens are unit focusing lens, focusing from 8 inches (20 cm) to infinity through precision gear linked to a focusing dial on top of the camera. All Minox cameras, except the EC and MX, have a parallax correction viewfinder: when the focusing dial moves, the viewfinder moves in tandem to correct for parallax.

From the Riga to Minox B, the film counter counts up to 50, while from Minox BL, C, to TLX, the film counter counts down from 36/30/15. For mechanical Minox 8x11 cameras, a separate shutter speed dial sets the shutter speed from 1/2 to 1/1000 second, plus B and T (the BL model has no documented T). For electromagnetic shutter cameras, the shutter dial starts with 1/15 sec, and ends with 1/1000 (Minox C), or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 (Minox LX/TLX/CLX); the electromagnetic Minox camera also has an &#x27;A&#x27; setting for automatic exposure, controlled by the built-in CdS (Minox C) or Spd (Minox LX/TLX) exposure meter.

Above the viewfinder is a filter bar used to slide a yellow, green or an orange filter in front of the lens; starting with the BL, there is only a Neutral Density filter.

For Riga Minox to Minox B, the film advances each time the camera is closed, regardless of whether a picture is taken or not. Opening the camera causes the pressure plate to press the film into a concave or flat (depending on the model) surface to stiffen thin emulsions for better clarity. When the camera is closed, the pressure plate moves back from the film plane, thus allowing the film strip to move freely to advance to the next frame. From Minox BL onward, the camera is equipped with a &quot;freewheeling&quot; mechanism, such that the film advances one frame only when a picture is taken, otherwise, closing the camera does not advance a frame.

Minox BL uses a PX625 button cell to power the CdS exposure meter; Minox C, LX, EC, used a 5.6v PX27 mercury battery to power the exposure meter and electromagnetic shutter. TLX, CLX, ECX use four 1.5v 386 silver oxide button cell in an adapter; this adapter combo can also be used to replace the discontinued 5.6v PX27 battery for Minox C, LX and EC.

8×11mm TLX Special Order models were available new until September 2014.

==Minox 35 mm cameras==

===Minox 35 mm compact cameras===
In 1974, Minox introduced a very compact (100 mm × 61 mm × 31 mm), glass fibre reinforced Makrolon bodied 35 mm film camera designed by Professor Fischer of Vienna University: the Minox EL, the first one in Minox 35 mm series. These compact cameras featured a drawbridge style lens cover which when lowered brought forward a 35 mm focal length f/2.8 four-element, three-group Tessar-type Minotar/Minoxar lens with between the lens leaf shutter and diaphragm, a center positioned viewfinder, two stroke film winder lever and a film rewind knob. The Minox 35 camera back must be removed for loading or unloading film.

The camera offered aperture priority exposure with the option of manual settings. The Minox 35ML and Minox M.D.C offer program mode (P mode) exposure in addition to aperture priority. The 35 mm/2.8 Minotar/Minoxar lens was very sharp, with low distortion, while the camera&#x27;s metering-system&#x27;s capability to produce excellent results especially under low-light conditions was outstanding – using exposure times of up to two minutes.

Some models have a 2x backlit exposure switch and a 10 sec timer switch. When the timer is engaged, a flashing LED indicates the timer counter is counting down, for the last two sec, the flash interval shortened.

Until 1995, the Minox 35 cameras were considered the smallest cameras for the standard 35 mm film format. The design was inspired by the Rollei 35, which had been the smallest 35 mm camera for eight years. The Rollei 35 is only slightly bigger, but much heavier than the Minox 35 cameras. However, the Minolta TC-1, introduced in 1996, is smaller.

====Minox 35 mm compact camera versions====
* Minox EL, 1974
* MINOX GL, 1979–1981
* MINOX GT, 1981–1991
* MINOX GT-Golf, 1984

MDC differs from all other models by its anodized aluminium shell over Macrolon body; with two styles: a gold plated model and a titanium coated model. MDC has a multicoated Minoxar 35 mm/2.8 lens, all other functions are identical to Minox 35ML. Due to the extra metal shell, the dimension of Minox M.D.C is slightly larger than other Minox 35 cameras.
* MINOX MDC gold Collection, 1993–1994
* MINOX AF mini, 1994–, autofocus
* MINOX GT-X, 1998–1999

<doc id="176060" wikidata="Q2477112" url="?curid=176060" title="German Romanticism">
<text>German Romanticism () was the dominant intellectual movement of German-speaking countries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, influencing philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and criticism. Compared to English Romanticism, the German variety developed relatively early, and, in the opening years, coincided with Weimar Classicism (1772–1805).

The early period, roughly 1797 to 1802, is referred to as &quot;Frühromantik&quot; or Jena Romanticism. The philosophers and writers central to the movement were Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder (1773–1798), Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854), Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772–1829), August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767–1845), Ludwig Tieck (1773–1853), and Friedrich von Hardenberg (Novalis) (1772–1801). 

The early German Romantics strove to create a new synthesis of art, philosophy, and science, by viewing the Middle Ages as a simpler period of integrated culture; however, the German Romantics became aware of the tenuousness of the cultural unity they sought. Late-stage German Romanticism emphasized the tension between the daily world and the irrational and supernatural projections of creative genius. In particular, the critic Heinrich Heine criticized the tendency of the early German Romantics to look to the medieval Holy Roman Empire for a model of unity in the arts, religion, and society.

A major product of the invasion and military occupation, beginning under the First French Republic and continuing under Napoleon, of the traditionally politically and religiously balkanized Germanosphere was the development of Pan-Germanism and romantic nationalism, which eventually created the German Confederation of 1815 and the German Empire of 1871. German Romanticism was accordingly rooted in both the quest, epitomized by Baron Joseph von Laßberg, Johann Martin Lappenberg, and the Brothers Grimm, for decolonisation, a distinctly German culture, and national identity, and hostility to certain ideas of The Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the Reign of Terror, and the First French Empire. Several major Romantic thinkers, especially Ernst Moritz Arndt, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, and Friedrich Schleiermacher, embraced many elements of Counter-Enlightenment political philosophy and were hostile to Classical liberalism, rationalism, neoclassicism, and cosmopolitanism, Other Romantics, like Heine, were fully in support of the German Revolutions of 1848.

==Composers==

* Ludwig van Beethoven. In his earlier works, Beethoven was a Classicist in the traditions of Mozart and Haydn (his tutor), but his Middle Period, beginning with his third symphony (the &#x27;Eroica&#x27;), bridges the worlds of Classical and Romantic music. Because Beethoven wrote some of his greatest music after he became totally deaf, he embodies the Romantic ideal of the tragic artist who defies all odds to conquer his own fate. His later works portray the triumph of the human spirit, most notably his &#x27;Choral&#x27; Symphony No. 9; the stirring &#x27;Ode to Joy&#x27; from this symphony has been adopted as the anthem of the European Union.
* Johannes Brahms. His works are cast in the formal moulds of Classicism; he had a profound reverence for Beethoven. Brahms was also attracted to the exoticism of Hungarian folk music, and used it in such pieces as his famous &quot;Hungarian Dances&quot;, the final movement of his Violin Concerto, and the &#x27;Rondo alla zingarese&#x27; from his Piano Quartet No. 1, op. 25, in G minor.
* Franz Liszt. Liszt was by nationality a Hungarian, but nevertheless he spent many years in Germany, and his first language was German. Credited as the inventor of the tone poem. In his old age, Liszt adopted a more dissonant, ominous flavour, characteristic works being &#x27;la Lugubre Gondola&#x27; and &#x27;Die Zelle in Nonnenwerth&#x27;—predating Impressionism and 20th-century atonality.
* Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy. A composer of the Early Romantic period, together with such figures as Schumann, Chopin and Liszt. One of the persons responsible for reviving interest in the somewhat neglected music of Johann Sebastian Bach.
* Franz Schubert. His body of work consists mainly of song cycles and German Lieder set to poems by his contemporaries, many of which are among the most common repertoire in those categories performed today.
* Robert Schumann. His works recall the nostalgia of lost childhood innocence, first love, and the magnificence of the German countryside. As an influential critic, he played a major role in discovering new talents, among them Chopin and Brahms.
* Richard Wagner. The most famous composer of German opera; was an exponent of Leitmotif. One of the main figures in the so-called War of the Romantics.
* Carl Maria von Weber. Perhaps the very first of Romantic musicians, if we exclude Beethoven, in the sense that Weber was the first major composer to emerge wholly as a product of the Romantic school, as contrasted with Beethoven, who had started off as a Classicist. The emotional intensity and supernatural, folklore-based themes in his operas presented a radical break from the Neoclassical traditions of that time.

<text>Edward Braddock (January 1695 – 13 July 1755) was a British officer and commander-in-chief for the Thirteen Colonies during the start of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), the North American front of what is known in Europe and Canada as the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). He is remembered for his command of a disastrous expedition against the French-occupied Ohio River Valley in 1755 which led to his death.

==Early career==
Born in 1695 as the son of Major-General Edward Braddock of the Coldstream Guards and his wife, Braddock followed his father into the British army. At the age of 15, he was appointed ensign in his father&#x27;s regiment on 11 October 1710. He was promoted to lieutenant of the grenadier company in 1716. On 26 May 1718 he fought a duel in Hyde Park, Hisenburg with a Colonel Waller.

Braddock was promoted to captain in 1736, at the age of 41. He made major in 1743, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the regiment on 21 November 1745.

He participated in the Siege of Bergen op Zoom in 1747. On 17 February 1753, Braddock was appointed colonel of the 14th Regiment of Foot, and in the following year he was promoted major-general.

==North America==

Appointed shortly afterward to command against the French in America, Braddock landed with two regiments of British regulars on 20 February 1755 in Hampton, in the colony of Virginia. He met with several of the colonial governors at the Congress of Alexandria on 14 April and was persuaded to undertake vigorous actions against the French. The attack would proceed on four fronts: a general from Massachusetts would attack at Fort Niagara, General William Johnson would attack Fort Saint-Frédéric at Crown Point, Colonel Robert Monckton at Fort Beausejour on the Bay of Fundy, while Braddock himself would lead an expedition against Fort Duquesne (now Pittsburgh) at the Forks of the Ohio River.

After some months of preparation, in which he was hampered by administrative confusion and want of resources previously promised by the colonials, the Braddock expedition took the field with a picked column, in which George Washington served as a volunteer officer. Braddock took some of his men and marched forward, leaving most of his men behind. The column crossed the Monongahela River on 9 July 1755, and shortly afterward collided head-on with an Indian and French force which was rushing from Fort Duquesne to oppose the river crossing. Although the initial exchange of musketry favored the British, felling the French commander and causing some Canadian militia to flee, the remaining Indian/French force reacted quickly. They ran down the flanks of the column and put it under a murderous crossfire.

Braddock&#x27;s troops reacted poorly and became disordered. The British attempted retreat, but ran into the rest of the British soldiers earlier left behind. Braddock rallied his men repeatedly, but fell at last, mortally wounded by a shot through the chest. Although the exact causes of the defeat are debated to this day, a contributing factor was likely Braddock&#x27;s underestimation of how effectively the French and Indians could react in a battle situation, and how rapidly the discipline and fighting effectiveness of his own men could evaporate.

Braddock was borne off the field by Washington and Col. Nicholas Meriwether; he died on 13 July from wounds suffered in the battle. Before he died, Braddock left Washington his ceremonial sash that he wore with his battle uniform, as well as his two pistols. Some of his last words were, &quot;Who would have thought?&quot; and &quot;we shall know better another time&quot;. Reportedly, Washington always took this sash with him for the rest of his life, both as the commander of the Continental Army and for his presidential duties. It is still on display today at Washington&#x27;s home on the Potomac River, Mount Vernon.

Braddock was buried just west of Great Meadows, where the remnants of the column halted on its retreat to reorganize. He was buried in the middle of the road that his men had just cut through and wagons were rolled over top of the grave site to prevent his body from being discovered and desecrated by the Indians. George Washington presided at the burial service, as the chaplain had been severely wounded.

==Legacy==

Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot; (1791) includes an account of helping General Braddock garner supplies and carriages for the general&#x27;s troops. He also describes a conversation with Braddock in which he explicitly warned the General that his plan to march troops to the fort through a narrow valley would be dangerous because of the possibility of an ambush. This is sometimes cited as advice against the disastrous eventual outcome, but the fact remains that Braddock was not ambushed in that final action, and the battle site was not, in any case, a narrow valley. Braddock had in fact taken great precautions against ambuscade, and had crossed the Monongahela an additional time to avoid the narrow Turtle Creek defile.

In 1804, human remains believed to be Braddock&#x27;s were found buried in the roadway about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) west of Great Meadows by a crew of road workers. The remains were exhumed and moved to a nearby site for reburial. A marble monument was erected over the new grave site in 1913 by the Coldstream Guards.

General Braddock is the namesake of Braddock Borough, Mt. Braddock, Braddock Hills, and North Braddock in Pennsylvania; the community of Braddock Heights or Braddock Mountain west of Frederick, Maryland; Braddock Middle School and Braddock Road in Cumberland, Maryland; and, in Virginia, Braddock Road, which runs from Alexandria to Aldie, a separate Braddock Road within the city of Alexandria – namesake of the Metrorail station at its eastern terminus – and Braddock Street in Winchester. Sections of the road cut by the British Army are known as the Braddock Road and form most of eastern U.S. Route 40 in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

==In fiction==
Braddock appears as an antagonist in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;, where George Washington is introduced as a young officer serving under Braddock in the French and Indian War. The game portrays Braddock as a ruthless general, who indiscriminately kills his enemies, civilians, and even his own allies to achieve his goals. Additionally, he is a former member of the fictitious Templar Order, and a rival of Haytham Kenway, the playable character during the game&#x27;s early missions. During his 1755 expedition, he is assassinated by Haytham with the help of several Native American tribes, who sought to see Braddock eliminated because his men ravaged their villages. 

Robert Matzen directed, wrote and produced the documentary &quot;When the Forest Ran Red: Washington, Braddock &amp; a Doomed Army&quot;, which dramatizes the ambush of Braddock by 250 French soldiers and 600 Native Americans.

<text>Julie Pottinger (née Cotler; born January 12, 1970), better known by her pen name, Julia Quinn, is an American author of historical romance fiction. Her novels have been translated into 41 languages and have appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestseller List 19 times. She has been inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. Her &quot;Bridgerton&quot; series of novels has been adapted for Netflix by Shondaland under the title &quot;Bridgerton&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Quinn was born as Julie Cotler in 1970 to Jane and Stephen Lewis Cotler. She has three sisters: Emily, Abigail, and Ariana. She is Jewish. She was raised primarily in New England, although she spent much of her time in California, following the divorce of her parents.

Quinn developed an appreciation for literature at an early age, and since childhood, she thoroughly enjoyed reading. At age 12, her father disagreed with her choices of reading material, which included the &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and the &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; book series, and he told her she co only continue reading them if she could prove that they contributed to the development of her reading skills. She promptly told him that she was studying the literary series, in order, because she was interested in writing a novel in the future. Challenged to prove that she was, indeed, interested in pursuing a writing career, Quinn sat down at their computer and wrote her first two chapters. After finishing her novel, three years later, she submitted it to &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, but it was rejected.

Quinn graduated from Hotchkiss School and Harvard University with a degree in Art History. During her senior year of college, she realized that she did not know what she wanted to do with her degree and decided to attend medical school. That decision required her to attend two additional years of college to complete the science prerequisites necessary to apply for medical school. She postponed medical school for two years while she wrote two more novels.

== Career ==
To occupy herself during the long days of studying science, Quinn began to write light-hearted Regency novels. A few weeks after she was accepted to medical school, she discovered that her first two novels, &quot;Splendid&quot; and &quot;Dancing At Midnight&quot;, had been sold at auction, an unusual occurrence for a novice romance author. By the time Quinn finally entered Yale School of Medicine, intending to become a doctor, three of her books had been published. After a few months of studying medicine, Quinn realized that she preferred writing to medical study. She left medical school and devoted herself, full-time, to her writing.

Quinn considers herself a feminist and gives her heroines feminist qualities that are not necessarily true to the most prevalent attitudes of the times her novels are set in. Her books are noted for their humor and sharp, witty dialogue. The novels are primarily character-driven, lacking the great external conflicts that many romance novels employ. One of her novels, &quot;When He Was Wicked&quot;, was unusual for a romance novel, as the first four chapters describe the heroine in a happy marriage with someone who is not the hero, and then shows the death of the original husband and deals with the grief of both the heroine and hero, before allowing the second love story to flourish.

Most of her books are dedicated to her husband, Paul Pottinger, often with references to amusing alternate titles for the work. Quinn won the Romance Writers of America RITA Award, in 2007, for &quot;On the Way to the Wedding&quot; and again, in 2008, for &quot;The Secret Diaries of Miss Miranda Cheever&quot;. When she won, in 2010, for &quot;What Happens in London&quot;, she became (at the time) the youngest member and is now one of only 16 authors to be inducted into the RWA Hall of Fame.

In 2003, she enjoyed the rare honor of being profiled in &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, an accomplishment few romance novelists have achieved. In 2005, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; gave &quot;To Sir Phillip, With Love&quot; a rare starred review, and later, the novel was named as one of the six best mass market original novels of the year.

Each of her last 17 novels have appeared on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List, with &quot;Mr. Cavendish, I Presume&quot; hitting number one in October 2008. Most recently, &quot;The Girl With the Make-Believe Husband&quot; was on the &quot;NYT&quot; list in June 2017. In addition to those, both her Lady Whistledown anthologies appeared on the &quot;NY Times&quot; list, as did both of her novel-in-three-part collaborations with Connie Brockway and Eloisa James (&quot;The Lady Most Likely&quot; and &quot;The Lady Most Willing&quot;), and the &quot;Bridgertons: Happily Ever After&quot; collection of Bridgerton’s second epilogues.

Her &quot;Bridgerton&quot; series of books has been adapted for Netflix by Shonda Rhimes, under the title &quot;Bridgerton&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 2001, Quinn won $79,000 on &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. She is an avid reader and posts recommendations of her favorite books on her Facebook page. 

Quinn resides in Seattle, Washington, with her husband and two children. 

On June 29, 2021, Quinn&#x27;s sister and father, Ariana Elise Cotler and Stephen Lewis Cotler, respectively, were killed by a drunk driver in Kaysville, Utah.

<doc id="176078" wikidata="Q313092" url="?curid=176078" title="Trevor Horn">
<text>Trevor Charles Horn (born 15 July 1949) is an English record producer and musician. His influence on pop and electronic music in the 1980s was such that he has been called &quot;the man who invented the eighties&quot;.

Horn took up the bass guitar at an early age and taught himself to sight-read music. In the 1970s, he worked as a session musician, built his own studio, and wrote and produced singles for various artists. Horn gained fame in 1979 as a member of the Buggles, who achieved a hit single with &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;. He was invited to join the progressive rock band Yes, becoming their lead singer. 

In 1981, Horn became a full-time producer, working on successful songs and albums for acts including Yes, Dollar, ABC, Malcolm McLaren, Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. In 1983, Horn and his wife, the music executive Jill Sinclair, purchased Sarm West Studios, London, and formed a record label, ZTT Records, with the journalist Paul Morley. Horn also co-formed the electronic group Art of Noise. Horn achieved hits in the following decades with Seal, t.A.T.u. and LeAnn Rimes, and produced the 2003 Belle and Sebastian record &quot;Dear Catastrophe Waitress.&quot; He has performed with the supergroup Producers, later known as the Trevor Horn Band, since 2006.

Horn&#x27;s awards include Brit Awards for Best British Producer in 1983, 1985, and 1992, a 1995 Grammy Award for Seal&#x27;s song &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot;, and a 2010 Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

==Early life==
Trevor Charles Horn was born on 15 July 1949 to John and Elizabeth Horn in Hetton-le-Hole, County Durham, England, and grew up in Durham City. The second of four children, he has two sisters, including the novelist Marjorie DeLuca, and a brother, the television producer Ken Horn. His father was a maintenance engineer at the neighbouring dairy and a professional musician who played the double bass in the Joe Clarke Big Band during the week. Horn attended Johnston Grammar School in Durham.

At around eight years of age, Horn took up the double bass and was taught the basics by his father, including the concept of playing triads. He taught himself the bass guitar and became confident in sight-reading music, using guide books and practising on his father&#x27;s four-string guitar in the spare room of the house. In his early teens, Horn filled in for his father on the double bass in the Joe Clarke band when he was late for a gig. At school Horn was given a recorder which he picked up with little effort as he already had music knowledge, and performed in the local youth orchestra. His interests turned to contemporary rock acts such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan. At 14, Horn played electric guitar in his first group, the Outer Limits, named after the 1963 television series, playing mainly covers by the Kinks.

Horn went on to pursue a &quot;succession of day jobs&quot;, including one at a rubber company. He also put on a Bob Dylan imitation act for two nights a week &quot;with a harmonica around my neck&quot;, and played the bass at odd gigs. Then, at seventeen, Horn decided to pursue a career in music and &quot;woke my parents up at 4am to tell them&quot;. They were reluctant at first as they wanted him to become a chartered accountant as he performed well in maths, but Horn had failed the required exams. Horn&#x27;s parents pleaded with him to try one more job, but three months into his role as a progress chaser in a plastic bag factory, he was fired. &quot;I said, &#x27;That&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m never going into that world again!&#x27;&quot;, and the next day, received an offer to play the bass in a local semi-professional band at a Top Rank Ballroom, playing top 40 and dance music for £24 a week for five nights&#x27; work. Horn also received airplay on BBC Radio Leicester, performing self-written songs on a guitar.

==Career==
===1971–1979: Early work===
At 21, Horn relocated to London and took up work by playing in a band which involved re-recording top 20 songs for BBC radio due to the needle time restrictions then in place. This was followed by a one-year tenure with Ray McVay&#x27;s big band, included performances at the world ballroom dancing championship and the television show &quot;Come Dancing&quot;. Horn also joined the Canterbury Tales, a group based in Margate, and spent time in Denmark where he ended up broke. His mother sent him money for his return journey. He also worked as a session musician for rock groups and jingles. At 24, Horn began work in Leicester, where he had a nightly gig playing bass at a nightclub and helped construct a recording studio. He produced songs for local artists, including a song for Leicester City F.C.

By 1976, Horn had returned to London. He played bass in Nick North and Northern Lights, a cabaret and covers band, which also featured the keyboardist Geoff Downes and the singer Tina Charles. Horn formed Tracks, a jazz fusion band inspired by Weather Report and Herbie Hancock, with the future Shakatak drummer Roger Odell, before he left to play in Charles&#x27;s backing band. Also in the band were the keyboardist Geoffrey Downes and the guitarist Bruce Woolley, both of whom Horn later worked with in the band the Buggles. Horn and Charles entered a short relationship, and Horn learned from her inspiring producer Biddu. 

In the mid-1970s, Horn worked for a music publisher on Denmark Street, London, producing demos. From 1977 to 1979, Horn worked on various singles as a songwriter, producer, or orchestra director, but without profit. Among his first was &quot;Natural Dance&quot; by Tony Cole and &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Back&quot; by Fallen Angel and the T.C. Band, featuring Woolley as songwriter, which Horn produced under the name &quot;T.C. Horn&quot;. He wrote &quot;Boot Boot Woman&quot;, the B-side to the Boogatti single &quot;Come Back Marianne&quot;. In 1978, Horn wrote, sang, and produced &quot;Caribbean Air Control&quot; under the pseudonym Big A, which features Horn pictured as a pilot on the front sleeve. In 1979, a full studio album, &quot;Star to Star,&quot; by Chromium, a &quot;sci-fi disco project&quot;, was released. It featured Horn and Downes as songwriters and producers, and Horn&#x27;s future Art of Noise bandmate Anne Dudley on keyboards. Other artists that Horn worked with included Woolley, John Howard, Dusty Springfield (&quot;Baby Blue&quot;), and the Jags (&quot;Back of My Hand&quot;). Horn achieved his first production hit when &quot;Monkey Chop&quot; by Dan-I reached No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart in 1979.

===1978–1980: The Buggles and &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;===

In 1978, Horn and Downes formed the new wave band the Buggles with early contributions from Woolley. They secured a recording deal with Island Records and spent much of 1979 recording their debut album, &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; (1980). The credits list Horn with co-production, lead vocals, guitar and bass.

The Buggles&#x27; debut single, &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, was released in September 1979 and reached No. 1 in the UK, propelling Horn, aged 30, to fame. In August 1981, &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; became the first music video to air on MTV.

===1980: Yes===
The Buggles secured management from Brian Lane, who was also managing the progressive rock band Yes. The Yes singer, Jon Anderson, and the keyboardist, Rick Wakeman, had both departed. Horn and Downes were invited to replace them, and Yes recorded an album, &quot;Drama&quot; (1980), with Horn on vocals and bass. On tour, Horn was poorly received by fans, who reacted poorly to &quot;this fat, dumpy guy at the front singing ... it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish&quot;. Yes sacked Horn after the tour.

===1980–1982: Dollar, ABC and Malcolm McLaren===
In 1980, Horn married the music executive Jill Sinclair, who became his manager. Sinclair told him that as an artist he would always be &quot;second division&quot;, but if he pursued production he would become the best in the world.Horn assembled studio equipment, including a Roland TR-808 drum machine, a sequencer, a Minimoog synthesiser and Simmons electronic drums. He spent £18,000 on a Fairlight CMI, an early digital synthesiser, one of four in the UK at the time. The Fairlight was one of the first digital samplers, allowing musicians to play back samples such as sound effects at different pitches. He said later: &quot;I knew what it was capable of, because I understood what it did. Most other people didn&#x27;t understand at the time – sampling was like a mystical world.&quot; Horn is credited as the &quot;key architect&quot; in incorporating sampling into &quot;the language of pop&quot;. His understanding of electronic equipment made him influential on the development of pop music in the following decade. 
In 1981, Horn completed a second Buggles album, &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording,&quot; largely on his own following Downes&#x27;s decision to form Asia. Horn produced &quot;The Dollar Album&quot; (1982) by the pop duo Dollar, writing the songs &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, &quot;Hand Held in Black and White&quot;, &quot;Give Me Back My Heart&quot; and &quot;Videotheque&quot;. All four became top 20 hits in the UK. Though Dollar were a middle-of-the-road band with little credibility, Horn saw an opportunity to combine the electronic music of Kraftwerk and the crooner Vince Hill. The music journalist Alexis Petridis said that &quot;The Dollar Album&quot; &quot;mapped out ... the sonic future of 80s pop&quot;, with &quot;booming drums, high-drama synthesisers and sampled voices&quot;.

Horn&#x27;s success with Dollar generated interest from other acts. He next produced &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; by ABC, which became one of the best-selling albums of 1982. During the recording, he persuaded ABC to replace their bassist, feeling he was subpar. Horn regretted the decision, and he later learnt that U2 had declined to work with him as they were concerned he would split the band.

In 1982, Horn and Sinclair formed a music publishing company, Perfect Songs. In 1983, Horn produced &quot;Duck Rock&quot; by the former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren. It featured the single &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot;, credited as the first British hip hop single.

===1983–1989: ZTT, Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Grace Jones===

In 1983, Horn and Sinclair purchased Basing Street Studios in west London from Chris Blackwell and renamed it Sarm West Studios. With the journalist Paul Morley, they co-founded a record label, ZTT Records. The first act they signed was Frankie Goes to Hollywood, for whom Horn produced their successful debut album, &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;. He dramatically restructured the lead single, &quot;Relax&quot;, described by &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; as a &quot;hi-NRG brand of dance-synth-pop&quot; that &quot;broke new sonic ground, while epitomising &#x27;80s excess in all its garish, overblown glory&quot;. &quot;Relax&quot; reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. At this point, Horn was working with Foreigner in the US on their album &quot;Agent Provocateur&quot; (1984). He left the project to work on the followup Frankie Goes to Hollywood singles &quot;Two Tribes&quot; and &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, which also reached No. 1.

Horn worked with Yes again to produce their 1983 album &quot;90125&quot;. He persuaded them to record &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;, which they resisted, deeming it &quot;too poppy&quot;. It became their only No. 1 single in the USA. In 1983, Horn co-formed the band the Art of Noise, co-writing several hits including &quot;Close (To the Edit)&quot;, &quot;Beat Box&quot;, &quot;Moments in Love&quot;, and &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;. &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; was intended as Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s second single, but was instead given to Grace Jones. Horn and his studio team reworked it into six separate songs to form Jones&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot;. It features the Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour.

In 1984, Horn was asked by Bob Geldof to produce the song &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, a charity song to raise money for the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia. Horn was receptive but said he would need at least six weeks, which would make it impossible to release by Christmas. However, he allowed the team to use his studios, Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, free for 24 hours on 25 November. Horn later remixed and co-produced the 12&quot; version and remixed it for the 1985 rerelease.

In the late 1980s, Horn relocated to Bel Air, Los Angeles, where he established Sarm West Coast LA, a residential recording studio. Horn produced another Yes album, &quot;Big Generator&quot; (1987) and co-produced the Simple Minds album Street Fighting Years with Steve Lipson (1989).

===1990s: Seal===
In 1990, Horn produced the debut album by the English singer Seal. This began a multi-album collaboration which Horn reasoned down to his liking of Seal&#x27;s voice and a &quot;musical empathy&quot; with how he works and the songs he writes. &quot;Seal&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK and lead single &quot;Crazy&quot; went to No. 2. The album marked a turning point in Horn&#x27;s production method, switching typical studio hardware for computers, and he recorded tracks on &quot;Seal&quot; using MIDI and Studio Vision software. Horn was pleased with the results and sold his PC equipment for an Apple Macintosh. At this stage of his career, Horn had lost his enthusiasm for producing 12-inch mixes of songs, and he brought in other remixers to make them while concentrating on albums.

He also produced half of the songs on Marc Almond&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Tenement Symphony&quot;, including the three singles on the album: &quot;Jacky&quot;, &quot;My Hand Over My Heart&quot; and &quot;The Days of Pearly Spencer&quot;, which reached #4 in the UK charts.

In the 1990s, Horn wrote and produced &quot;Riding into Blue (Cowboy Song)&quot;, recorded by Inga Humpe, and &quot;Docklands&quot;, recorded by Betsy Cook. He also co-wrote two songs with Terry Reid for his 1991 album &quot;The Driver,&quot; and wrote &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; for the 1995 Cher album &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot;.

Horn co-produced Mike Oldfield&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot; alongside Oldfield and Tom Newman. Oldfield was a fan of &quot;Video Killed The Radio Star&quot; and described Horn as like being a judge in a courtroom when presenting some of his ideas for the album, to which Horn would either nod or shake his head. This, according to Oldfield, gave him a kind of a filter for which ideas worked.

Horn collaborated with the composer Hans Zimmer to produce the score for the 1992 film &quot;Toys&quot;, which included interpretations by Tori Amos, Thomas Dolby, Pat Metheny and Wendy &amp; Lisa. Horn co-wrote &quot;Everybody Up&quot;, the theme song to the comedy series &quot;The Glam Metal Detectives&quot; broadcast on BBC2 in 1995. This was another collaboration with Lol Creme.

In the mid-1990s, Horn and Sinclair bought Hook End Manor in Oxfordshire and renamed its recording facility Sarm Hook End. In 1995, Horn produced &quot;The Carpet Crawlers 1999&quot;, a rerecording of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; by Genesis, which featured vocals from their former singers, Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. It was released on the compilation &quot;Turn It On Again: The Hits&quot; (1999). In 1996, Horn produced the multi-platinum album &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; by Tina Turner. According to the duo Wendy &amp; Lisa, Horn produced an album for them in the late 1990s that went unreleased. Lisa Coleman said Horn and Sinclair objected to their homosexuality as sinful.

===2000s: t.A.T.u., LeAnn Rimes and Belle and Sebastian===
In the 2000s, Horn was hired by Interscope Records to create English-language versions of songs by the Russian pop duo t.A.T.u. He wrote new lyrics for &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; and &quot;Not Gonna Get Us&quot; and coached t.A.T.u. to sing them in English. He also rerecorded the instruments, as he did not have access to the original multitracks. &quot;All the Things She Said&quot; reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; named it Horn&#x27;s greatest work since the mid-80s.

For the 2000 film &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, Horn produced &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight the Moonlight&quot; by the American singer LeAnn Rimes. It sold more than two million copies worldwide and reached No. 1 in the UK and Australia. Horn co-wrote &quot;Pass the Flame&quot; (the official torch relay song for the 2004 Olympics in Athens) in collaboration with Lol Creme and co-wrote the title track from Lisa Stansfield&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;The Moment&quot;.

Horn co-wrote &quot;Sound the Bugle&quot;, performed by Bryan Adams and featured on the &quot;&quot; soundtrack and produced 3 tracks (La Sombra del Gigante, Un Angel No Es and Mujer Amiga Mia) of Stilelibero (Freestyle) Estilolibre by Eros Ramazzotti, released on 29 May 2001. 

Horn produced the 2003 Belle and Sebastian album &quot;Dear Catastrophe Waitress&quot;. Horn, known for using electronic equipment to transform music, was seen as a surprising choice for Belle and Sebastian, who were described by the &quot;Guardian&quot; as &quot;the last living purveyors of arts-and-crafts indie values&quot;. 

On 11 November 2004, a Prince&#x27;s Trust charity concert celebrating Horn&#x27;s 25 years as a record producer took place at Wembley Arena, featuring performances from Horn and many acts he produced. It was released on DVD as &quot;Produced By Trevor Horn: A Concert For The Prince&#x27;s Trust - Live At Wembley Arena London 2004&quot; (2005) and &quot;Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to the Rhythm&quot; (2008), and accompanied by a compilation album, &quot;Produced by Trevor Horn&quot; (2004).
In 2006, Horn co-formed the supergroup the Producers, with the singer Lol Creme, the producer Steve Lipson, the drummer Ash Soan and the singer-songwriter Chris Braide. They performed their first gig at the Camden Barfly in November 2006. They continue to perform under the name the Trevor Horn Band.

Horn produced the ninth album by the synth-pop duo the Pet Shop Boys, &quot;Fundamental&quot;, released in May 2006. It reached No. 5 in the UK chart. In the same month, he featured in a Pet Shop Boys concert specially recorded for BBC Radio 2. Horn produced an album version of the event, &quot;Concrete&quot;, released on 23 October 2006. Horn also produced Captain&#x27;s debut album, &quot;This is Hazelville&quot;, released in late 2006. In the same year, he also worked with British band Delays on their song &quot;Valentine&quot;, which was released as the lead single from their album &quot;You See Colours&quot;. He has also worked with John Legend and David Jordan.

On 25 June 2006, Sinclair was accidentally hit by a pellet from an air gun, causing irreversible brain damage and paralysing her. The following year, Horn sold their Sarm Hook End residential studio for £12 million and relocated to Primrose Hill, London.

For the 2008 movie &quot;Wanted&quot; (starring James McAvoy and Angelina Jolie), Horn produced Danny Elfman&#x27;s vocals on the closing credits song &quot;The Little Things&quot;.

In 2009, Horn produced &quot;Reality Killed the Video Star&quot;, the eighth album by Robbie Williams. The album title references the Buggles song and Horn and Williams&#x27; mutual disdain for reality television and music contest programmes. It reached No. 2 on the UK Album Chart and was Williams&#x27; first studio album not to reach No. 1.

===2010s–present===
Horn was the executive producer of Jeff Beck&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Emotion &amp; Commotion&quot;. He returned to work with Yes again, producing their new album from October 2010. That album, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Fly From Here,&quot; is a reunion of sorts for Horn&#x27;s former bandmate Geoff Downes; not only is Downes a member of the band&#x27;s current incarnation, but the album also takes its title from a song written by Horn and Downes and performed by Yes during their original stint with the band in 1980.

In 2017, Horn wrote the music for the Stan Lee co-produced anime &quot;The Reflection&quot;, the soundtrack being released as the first album under Horn&#x27;s name. Horn remixed 2011&#x27;s &quot;Fly From Here&quot; with Yes, adding new vocals and editing parts. The album is called &quot;Fly from Here – Return Trip&quot; and was released in March 2018. He has also been working on musicals, including one called &quot;The Robot Sings&quot;.

In November 2018, Horn performed a one-off concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. Horn&#x27;s new album, &quot;Trevor Horn Reimagines the Eighties&quot;, was released on 25 January 2019. A single, &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;, with vocals by Robbie Williams, was released on 24 October 2018. Further guests include Rumer, All Saints, Simple Minds and Gabrielle Aplin. In late 2017, Horn&#x27;s Sarm West Coast residential studio in Bel Air, Los Angeles, was destroyed in the Skirball Fire. Horn was not present at the time of the fire.

Horn toured as the bass player in Dire Straits Legacy in 2018–20. In late 2022, he published a memoir, &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording: From ABC to ZTT.&quot; He joined Seal&#x27;s 2023 tour, playing bass in Seal&#x27;s band and reviving the Buggles as an opening act.

In December 2023, Horn released &quot;&quot;, another album of covers with guest singers.

==Influence==

Musicians and producers including Gary Barlow, DJ Shadow and Nigel Godrich cite Horn as an influence.

==Personal life==
Horn met Jill Sinclair, a former mathematics teacher, in 1977. They married in 1980 and became business partners. They had four children: two sons, Aaron and Will, and two daughters, Gabriella and Alexandra, the latter of whom has worked as a trainee solicitor. Aaron (known in the industry as &quot;Aaron Audio&quot;), like his father, is a musician and producer. He was in the band Sam and the Womp and frequently DJs around London (he lives in north London). Both Aaron and Ally Horn are co-directors of Sarm Studios. , Horn has three grandsons. He is not Jewish, but he has attended synagogue with his children, who were raised in his wife&#x27;s faith. In a 2019 interview, he said that he &quot;believes in [Judaism] more than anything else&quot;.

On 25 June 2006, Sinclair was accidentally hit by a pellet from an air gun, causing irreversible brain damage and paralysing her. She died of cancer on 22 March 2014, aged 61.

<doc id="176083" wikidata="Q380949" url="?curid=176083" title="William IV, Prince of Orange">
<text>William IV (Willem Karel Hendrik Friso; 1 September 1711 – 22 October 1751) was Prince of Orange from birth and the first hereditary stadtholder of all the United Provinces of the Netherlands from 1747 until his death in 1751. During his whole life, he was furthermore ruler of the Principality of Orange-Nassau within the Holy Roman Empire.

==Early life==
William was born in Leeuwarden, Netherlands, the son of John William Friso, Prince of Orange, head of the Frisian branch of the House of Orange-Nassau, and of his wife Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). He was born six weeks after the death of his father.

William succeeded his father as Stadtholder of Friesland and also, under the regency of his mother until 1731, as Stadtholder of Groningen. In 1722 he was elected Stadtholder of Guelders. The four other provinces of the Dutch Republic—Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht and Overijssel—had in 1702 decided not to appoint a stadtholder after the death of stadtholder William III, ushering the Republic into a period that is known as the Second Stadtholderless Period. In 1747 those four provinces also accepted William as their stadtholder.

==Marriage and children==
In 1733 William was made a Knight of the Order of the Garter. On 25 March 1734 he married at St James&#x27;s Palace Anne, Princess Royal, eldest daughter of King George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach. William and Anne had three children:
* Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau (28 February 1743 – 6 May 1787), married Karl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg
* Princess Anna of Orange-Nassau (15 November 1746 – 29 December 1746) died in infancy.
* William V, Prince of Orange (8 March 1748 – 9 April 1806)

==Later life==
In 1739 William inherited the estates formerly owned by the Nassau-Dillenburg branch of his family, and in 1743 he inherited those formerly owned by the Nassau-Siegen branch of his family.
In 1740, the War of the Austrian Succession broke out. The conflict pitted Austria against France over the issue of whether Maria Theresa had the right to inherit her father Emperor Charles VI&#x27;s crown. The Dutch Republic sided with Austria in 1747 in order to maintain a buffer zone between itself and France, whereupon French troops invaded the Austrian Netherlands. In a few weeks, Louis XV&#x27;s troops conquered most of the towns in the Austrian Netherlands where the Dutch had stationed troops under the Barrier Treaty, as well as the most important towns in Zeelandic Flanders. The Dutch Republic was at the time weakened by internal division. The Dutch decided that their country needed a single strong executive, and turned to the House of Orange. William and his family moved from Leeuwarden to The Hague. On 4 May 1747, the States General of the Netherlands named William General Stadtholder of all seven of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, and made the position hereditary for the first time. William first met Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1747, and two years later appointed him field marshal of the Dutch States Army, which later led to Louis Ernest serving as one of the regents for William&#x27;s heir.

William IV was considered an attractive, educated, and accomplished prince in his prime. Although he had little experience in state affairs, William was at first popular with the people. He stopped the practice of indirect taxation by which independent contractors managed to make large sums for themselves. Nevertheless, he was also a Director-General of the Dutch East India Company, and his alliance with the business class deepened while the disparity between rich and poor grew.

William served as General Stadtholder of all the Netherlands until he died of a stroke in 1751 at The Hague.

The county of Orange, Virginia, and the city of Orangeburg, South Carolina, are named after him.

<text>Efke is the brand name of photographic films, papers, and chemicals that were manufactured by &quot;Fotokemika Zagreb d.d.&quot;, a company located in Samobor, Croatia.

==Products description==
The Efke films are black-and-white films with high silver content and as a result give a large exposure latitude and high quality grayscale reproduction when compared with modern films. The Efke 25, 50 and 100 products were made using the ADOX formulas that were first introduced in the 1950s.

Efke also made an infrared film sold as Efke IR820, a color film branded as &quot;efkecolor&quot; in ISO speeds of 100/400 (1986-1992), spektar 100/200/400 (~1992-2009) and HG100 (~1996-?) as well as a 100 ISO color reversal film called &quot;efkechrome&quot; (1982-1999).

Color Efke films are very rare and information is almost impossible to find due to the color film being discontinued rather quickly compared to Efke&#x27;s other product lines.

The black and white Efke films are more forgiving of exposure variations than modern tabular crystal films. The nature of the product also allows large, grain free, enlargements to be made from negatives.

Efke black and white films were coated in one layer, unlike most other films which are coated in multiple layers. This makes the film thinner and the emulsion more easily damaged, especially when still wet after development. A hardening fixer can be used to help protect the emulsion. The film base is also thinner and more transparent, making inspection of the negative easier. However it can also make the film curl more easily.

Efke was the only manufacturer making 127 format film between 1995, when Kodak discontinued the format, and 2006, when a Canadian company also began making 127.

Efke&#x27;s Infrared Film, sold under the brand name Efke IR820 was the only infrared film manufactured that has good IR sensitivity beyond 750 nm extending out to 820 nm. In the past other films such as Kodak&#x27;s HIE offered this but have recently been discontinued and are no longer made.

==Closing==

Fotokemika ceased all production on 30 August 2012.

As a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and the subsequent privatization process of the company, its equipment and Real Estate were sold to western companies and many of its workers laid off during the 90s and 2000s, which ultimately led the company to its bankruptcy.

For a short while after its closing the company existed as a distributor of medical films and materials made by other manufacturers.

== Legacy ==
There have been efforts to save the Fotokemika heritage.

In late 2020 Croatian photographer &quot;Silvester Kolbas&quot; organized an exhibition about efke, the company &quot;Fotokemika Zagreb d.d&quot; and its heritage at the Museum of Technology &quot;Nikola Tesla&quot;, Zagreb, called &quot;Fotokemika&quot; showcasing old equipment and products, that were left behind in the abandoned factory facilities of &quot;Fotokemika Zagreb d.d&quot;, as well as photos taken with expired efke black and white film.

<doc id="176089" wikidata="Q2564306" url="?curid=176089" title="Berne three-step test">
<text>In international law, the Berne three-step test is a clause that is included in several international treaties on intellectual property. Signatories of those treaties agree to standardize possible limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights under their respective national copyright laws.

== Berne Convention ==
The three-step test was first established in relation to the exclusive right of reproduction under Article 9(2) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works in 1967. Article 9 of the Berne Convention states that:

&quot;Right of Reproduction: 1. Generally; 2. Possible exceptions; 3. Sound and visual recordings&quot; - (1) Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form. (2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author. (3) Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction for the purposes of this Convention. 
The test is vague; But, spelled out in the formulation of Hugenholtz and Okediji, the three steps are:
# Limitations and exceptions cannot be &quot;overly broad&quot; [= &quot;certain special cases&quot;]
# Limitations and exceptions cannot &quot;rob right holders of a real or potential source of income that is substantive&quot; [= &quot;conflicting with normal exploitation of the work&quot;]
# Limitations and exceptions cannot &quot;do disproportional harm to the rights holders&quot; [= &quot;prejudice legitimate interests&quot;]
The three-step test in Article 9(2) of the Berne does not apply to copyright exceptions that are implemented under other parts of the Berne convention that have a separate standard, such as those in articles 2(4), 2(7), 2(8), 2 bis, 10, 10 bis and 13(1), or the Berne Appendix. 

=== Other copyright treaties ===
The three-step test has been modified and transplanted into the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the WIPO Copyright Treaty (Article 10), the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (Article 16(2)), the EU Computer Programs Directive (Article 6(3)), the EU Database Directive (Article 6(3)), and the EU Copyright Directive (Article 5(5)).

The test as included in Article 13 of TRIPs reads:

&quot;Members shall confine limitations and exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the rights holder.&quot;
The WTO three-step test does not apply to cases where the Berne or Rome Conventions provide separate standards for exceptions, or for rights not covered in the TRIPS Agreement.

== Interpretation ==
The technical legal reasoning which has been applied to suggest how this wording should be interpreted is arcane (see the references below). To date, only one legal case (before a WTO dispute settlement panel, involving U.S. copyright exemptions allowing restaurants, bars and shops to play radio and TV broadcasts without paying licensing fees, passed in 1998 as a rider to the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act) has actually required an interpretation of the test. 

The three-step test may prove to be extremely important if any nations attempt to reduce the scope of copyright law, because unless the WTO decides that their modifications comply with the test, such states are likely to face trade sanctions. Exceptions to copyright protection are required to be clearly defined and narrow in scope and reach. For instance, the three-step test was invoked as a justification for refusing certain exceptions to copyright wished for by members of the French parliament during the examination of the controversial DADVSI copyright bill.

== Patents ==
TRIPs Article 30, covering limitations and exemptions to patent law, is also derived from a somewhat different three-step test, that includes &quot;taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.&quot; Exceptions to exclusive patent rights are not subject to this test if they are implemented through Article 31 of the TRIPS, or Articles 6, 40 or 44.2.

<text>Ricardo Antonio Mayorga Perez (born October 3, 1973) is a Nicaraguan professional boxer and former mixed martial artist. In boxing he is a former two-weight world champion, having held the unified WBA (Unified), WBC, &quot;Ring&quot; magazine, and lineal welterweight titles in 2003, and the WBC super welterweight title from 2005 to 2006. Mayorga first became well known to boxing fans upon being featured on the cover of &quot;The Ring&quot;″s December 2003 issue, entitled &quot;The craziest man in the sport: Mayorga lights up boxing.&quot; He has since maintained this infamous reputation with his relentless trash-talk in the build-up to most of his fights, as well as his smoking and drinking habits outside the ring.

==Professional boxing career==
===Mayorga vs. Lewis===

After defending the title against Larry Marks, Andrew Lewis took on Mayorga. The bout ended in the 2nd round and was ruled a No Contest due to a nasty cut on Lewis caused by accidental headbutt. Lewis&#x27;s lost the title in a rematch to Mayorga in 2002 via 5th-round TKO.

===Mayorga vs. Forrest I, II===

In January 2003, Vernon Forrest (35–0–0) fought Mayorga. Mayorga was a mostly unknown fringe contender from Nicaragua and few gave him a chance to win against the significantly bigger and stronger Forrest. Mayorga shocked the world when he easily dominated Forrest, dropping him once in the 1st round and again in the 3rd round. The referee would call off the fight after the second knockdown, as Forrest was visibly dazed and unable to get his footing.

Forrest would rematch Mayorga six months later, losing again, this time by a majority decision. The bout was close and competitive, with Mayorga mostly chasing Forrest around the ring while Forrest was content to fight from the outside.

===Mayorga vs. Spinks===

Cory Spinks (31–2–0) rose to boxing stardom by unifying the WBC, WBA, IBF, and &quot;The Ring&quot; lineal welterweight titles on December 13, 2003, when he defeated Mayorga by majority decision. Spinks was a 5 to 1 underdog going into the fight with Mayorga. The judges scored the fight 114–112, 117–109, 114-114, favoring Spinks.

===Mayorga vs. Trinidad===

Félix Trinidad (41–1–0) announced a comeback on March 2, 2004. On October 2, 2004, he fought against Mayorga, in Madison Square Garden. Early in the 1st round Mayorga was on the offensive connecting several combinations, later in the round Trinidad connected some punches to his opponent&#x27;s face. Mayorga reacted defiantly while lowering his defense, which Trinidad used to continue the offensive during the closing seconds. In the 2nd round, Trinidad continued connecting with combinations to Mayorga&#x27;s face which caused him to bleed from his nose; the round concluded with both fighters exchanging punches. In the 3rd round, Mayorga attempted to counter with punches to the body but did not do significant damage to his opponent, however later in the round one of these punches made Trinidad lose his balance and touch the floor with one glove which the referee counted as a knockdown. In the 4th round, both boxers traded hard combinations. In the 5th round, Trinidad displayed control of the offense&#x27;s tempo injuring Mayorga and opening a cut under one of his eyes. This pattern continued in the 6th and 7th round, and the cut on Mayorga&#x27;s face began to swell. In the 8th round, Trinidad scored several knockdowns, Mayorga continued after two knockdowns, but lost by technical knockout following a third knockdown.

===Mayorga vs. De La Hoya===

Oscar De La Hoya (37–4-0) took a layoff of 20 months before signing to fight Mayorga. In the buildup to the fight, Mayorga insulted everything from De La Hoya&#x27;s sexuality to his wife and child, but when they fought on May 6, 2006, De La Hoya knocked Mayorga down in the first minute of the fight with a left hook. De La Hoya knocked him out in the 6th round to take his tenth world title.

===Mayorga vs. Vargas===
It was confirmed on May 13, 2007, that Fernando Vargas (26–4–0) would face Mayorga on September 8, 2007, on Showtime PPV for the vacant WBC Continental Americas super middleweight title. However the fight was postponed after it was discovered during a routine blood test that Vargas was suffering from a severe iron deficiency. Doctors ordered Vargas not to participate in the upcoming bout until he received the necessary weeks of treatment to correct the problem. When the bout eventually took place it would be fought at 162 pounds, a weight that neither boxer has ever fought at. Many sources claim that Vargas had complained about fighting at the Jr. Middleweight limit of 154 pounds, stating that it&#x27;s &quot;too much for his body to take&quot;. Vargas has stated that fighting at that weight was the reason he did poorly against Mosley in the second fight.

Vargas claimed that this would be the last fight of his career regardless of the result. He warned Mayorga that he would not tolerate any insults from him like the ones he hurled at De La Hoya in their press conferences. Vargas stayed true to his promise when at the first official press conference for the fight, Mayorga said some offensive things towards Vargas and attempted to slap him. Vargas immediately jumped up from his seat and retaliated with punches and a brawl broke out between the two fighters&#x27; camps, though order was quickly restored. Vargas also recalled the time when Mayorga said Vargas was scared of him when he had defeated Javier Castillejo, then was stripped of his WBC light middleweight title rather than face Mayorga, who then defeated Michele Piccirillo for the vacant title. Ultimately the contestants faced off, and Mayorga defeated Vargas by majority decision on November 23, 2007. The scores were 113-113, 114–112, and 115–111. Crucially, Vargas was knocked down in the 1st round and again in the 11th round. Post-fight Mayorga apologized to Vargas and the two forgave each other. Vargas officially declared his retirement soon after.

===Mayorga vs. Mosley===
In August 2008, it was announced that Shane Mosley (44–5-0) would fight at light middleweight against Mayorga. The fight was to take place at Home Depot Center in California on September 27, 2008. The first time since 2000 that Mosley would fight in his home state. The fight was for the vacant WBA Inter-Continental light middleweight title. Mosley was guaranteed $1 million. During the first three rounds of the bout, the harder puncher appeared to be Mayorga, who landed right hands from long range. Mayorga&#x27;s roughhousing mixed with his usual showboating antics seemed to bother Mosley, who appeared more uncomfortable and agitated. In recklessly lunging in with wild power shots of his own, Mosley wound up falling into more clinches and getting caught with punches he should have avoided. Mosley settled down and found the distance in the 4th round and took the next three rounds by timing Mayorga with overhand rights that landed and occasionally following up with short hooks and single body shots. Mosley continued with right hands in the seventh and eighth rounds. Mosley was able to land single power shots in the late rounds, but threw very few combinations. At times Mayorga beat Mosley to the punch with lead right hands. Near the end of the eleventh round, Mosley landed a right hand that splattered blood from Mayorga&#x27;s mouth. With less than a minute left in the bout, put Mayorga down on his hands and knees. Mayorga got up on unsteady legs; Mosley stepped in with a short, lead left hook that put Mayorga flat on his back at the bell, resulting in the referee waving the bout off. At the time of stoppage, two judges had Mosley ahead with scored of 107-102 and 105–104, whilst the third judge had Mayorga ahead 105–104. Had the fight gone to scorecards, Mosley would have won via unanimous decision due to the last round being a 10–7.

===Mayorga vs. Cotto===

On January 19, 2011, in a press conference at Times Square, New York, Bob Arum and Don King, working together for the first time in five years, officially announced that Miguel Cotto (35–2–0) would defend his WBA light middleweight title against Mayorga at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada on March 12, 2011, live on Showtime PPV. In front of 7,247 at the MGM, Cotto defeated Mayorga via TKO in the 12th round, retaining his WBA light middleweight title. Throughout the fight, Mayorga looked to engage, however the discipline on Cotto played a big part in the win, saving his big shots for the final round. A left hook ended, which dropped Mayorga ended the bout. At the time of stoppage, Cotto was ahead by five points on all three judges&#x27; scorecards. With the win, Cotto&#x27;s record for world title fights improved to (17–2). Cotto earned $1 million from the fight and compubox stats showed that Cotto out punched Mayorga 249 to 176 in total punches. In the post-fight, Cotto explained how he won the fight, &quot;The game plan was not to get caught up in any of his antics. He was very heavy handed, I felt his punches the whole fight.&quot; He also mentioned how before the last round, his trainer Emanuel Steward told him he would be able to stop Mayorga in the last round, which was the conclusion of the fight.

===Mayorga vs. Mosley II===
Mayorga decided to make a comeback as a boxer and won two fights in 2014, after over three-and-a-half years since losing to Cotto. He was then scheduled to rematch Mosley (47–9–1) in a fight on pay-per-view at The Forum located in Inglewood, California on August 29, 2015. Mosley would again defeat Mayorga, this time by KO in the sixth round.

==Mixed martial arts career==
On May 15, 2010, Mayorga was scheduled to make his professional MMA debut against UFC veteran Din Thomas on the Shine Fights: Worlds Collide: Mayorga vs. Thomas card. Don King filed for an injunction the week of the fight to prevent him from participating, claiming Mayorga had an exclusive contract with Don King Promotions (DKP).

Shine Fights stated that Mayorga&#x27;s contract with DKP was for boxing, and as such did not apply to mixed martial arts. Judge Marc Gold granted the injunction just several hours before the fight. Later on the same day, Shine Fights officials conceded defeat in the matter and Mayorga was pulled off the card.

Following his retirement from boxing, Mayorga decided to properly embark on a professional MMA career and faced Wesley Tiffer on May 3, 2013. He was kept on the ground but able to survive round 1. Tiffer continued to grapple with him on the ground until Mayorga landed a controversial and illegal knee to Tiffer&#x27;s spine, which left Tiffer screaming in pain. Mayorga won via TKO after Tiffer didn&#x27;t answer the bell for round 3. The Nicaraguan Mixed Martial Arts Commission declared the fight a No Contest for the illegal knee a week later on May 10, 2013, and also suspended Mayorga for 3 months for being 20 pounds over the contracted weight limit of 165-lbs.

==Life outside boxing==
In the aftermath of his loss to the aforementioned Cotto, Mayorga went on record to state that he doesn&#x27;t entirely dismiss the possibility of a comeback. Sources close to him predicted that he would return to the sport to face Antonio Margarito in a bout that would&#x27;ve supposedly been dubbed: &quot;When villains collide&quot;, with the winner earning themselves one final shot at being able to resurrect their career and the loser permanently retiring from boxing – a fight that would&#x27;ve entertained fans not only at a press conference, but also inside the ring as well.

As of 2023, this match has not taken place.

<doc id="176107" wikidata="Q175322" url="?curid=176107" title="Flémalle">
<text>Flémalle (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia within the Liège Province in Belgium.

As of 2024, it has a population of 27,002, and together with the municipalities of Liège, Seraing, Herstal, Saint-Nicolas, and Ans, forms the Liège metropolitan area, with a total population of 381,340. Flémalle&#x27;s geographical location, between valleys, Hesbaye, and Condroz, as well as between countryside and urban areas, offers a mix of nature, as seen in the locality of Gleixhe, and urban environments like its center or the suburb of Les Trixhes.

Despite its steep terrain, the municipality must address the increasing population in the metropolitan area; it is located near Seraing, highways, the Meuse, and the Liège Airport. To address this, the municipality has launched several large-scale projects, such as the construction of a brand-new neighborhood, Flémalle-Neuve, which is expected to be completed in a few years.

Historically, the municipality has witnessed the birth and advancement of paleontology and prehistoric studies thanks to Dr. Philippe-Charles Schmerling. A Roman diploma was also discovered in the area. During the Middle Ages, the municipality experienced economic prosperity due to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, particularly in the village of Chokier, where a tsar, Peter the Great, and several generals from various empires stayed. During both World Wars, it played a crucial role in the defense of Liège with its fort.

André Cools is a historical figure in Flémalle&#x27;s politics, but his influence extended beyond the municipality. He served as Minister of the Budget, Vice Prime Minister, President of the PSB, the PS, and the Walloon Parliament, before being assassinated in 1991.

Sports are also a significant source of recognition for the municipality, with several prominent athletes from the region and the country having connections to Flémalle. Notably, two kickboxing world championships have been held in the municipality. In team sports, ROC Flémalle is one of the top handball clubs in the country, with three Belgian Cups and eleven national titles.

== Toponymy ==
Like Bomal, Emael, Fumal, Hermalle-sous-Argenteau, Hermalle-sous-Huy, Lamalle, Momalle, Omal, and Xhendremael, Flémalle bears the suffix &quot;-malle&quot; (mal, mael), which is the Walloon version of the Dutch suffix &quot;-maal,&quot; commonly found in Hesbaye.

The name of the municipality was first mentioned in 1086 in a charter as &quot;Fleimala&quot;. In 634, the locality was called &quot;Flédismamalacha&quot;.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
The prehistoric and paleontological advancements we know today about the Flémalle region as well as the world, are due to Dr. Philippe-Charles Schmerling, a professor from University of Liège, who explored several caves in the Liège region including those at Chokier and Schmerling Caves.

They were named &quot;Engis Caves&quot; by Schmerling before being named in his honor. Schmerling believed the caves were located within the territory of the commune of Engis. They are known worldwide for being the site where the first Neanderthal-type fossil bone, Engis 2, was discovered. He also discovered the second fossil deposit of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; in these caves. Other bones of this type were only found in Wales at that time.

There was a second cave, but it has collapsed. The site is listed on the Exceptional Heritage List of the Walloon Region. The discovery of the Schmerling Caves dates back to 1929.

The other cave in the commune, located in the entity of Ivoz-Ramet, is the Ramioul Cave. It was discovered in 1911 by Les Chercheurs de la Wallonie. Various excavations have uncovered several layers corresponding to successive occupations between 70,000 BC (Neanderthals) and 2300 BC with Aurignacian and Mousterian remains. The cave belongs to the Préhistomuseum, one of the largest European museums on Prehistory.

=== Antiquity ===
When, between 57 and 50 BCE, Julius Caesar conquered Gaul, the population of Flémalle and its surroundings became Roman. This conquest of Gaul allowed Belgium to adopt the knowledge, customs, and traditions of the Romans.

A document, a pagan altar stone, informs us about the worship of the deity Mosea.

==== Roman Diploma ====
The Flémalle Roman diploma is an archaeological document of great importance. It dates from the reign of Trajan, from the year 98. It was recovered from the Meuse River in 1880. This diploma, belonging to a soldier from Tongeren (though this is disputed), tells us that the holder of such a document, a Roman soldier, could obtain leave to return to his village. However, this document poses a problem because many soldiers had a villa built where they conducted their military campaign.

=== Middle Ages ===

When the Western Roman Empire came to an end, the Franks took advantage to invade the former Roman territories. The historical period we are interested in here is that of the Principality of Liège, which emerged through misunderstandings and succession wars after the death of Charlemagne.

The Awirs stream brought prosperity to the locality with mills, zinc and lead mines that were exploited until the 15th century. Also in Awirs, the presence of a Cistercian monastery can be noted.

In the village of Chokier, it is believed that lime kilns were present due to a 1086 charter that specifies a land exchange between the village and the Saint-Jacques Abbey. This parcel was located under &quot;Calchariae,&quot; meaning lime kiln.

Industry was already very present as, besides the lime kilns of Chokier, there was also coal and quarry exploitation dating back to the 14th and 15th century. This exploitation lasted over time as the last Flémalle coal mine closed in 1955.

==== Seigneuries ====
The Principality is divided into several districts, including La Hesbaye, where the current territory was located. This district was composed of counties, including Hozémont, to which the Awirs, Gleixhe, Chokier, and the two Flémalle (the Grand and the Small) were attached. The Council of Hozémont played an important role in the region.

Flémalle, within its current territory, was divided into several , it is learned that the seigneury was given to the Templars. Another lord owned lands in Flémalle, which were confirmed by pope Honorius III.

In the 13th century, Flémalle was shared between four seigneuries: the Chapter of Saint Peter, the Brethren of Saint John, the Abbey of Saint-Laurent, and the Regular Brethren of Saint Augustine of Val-Benoît.

* Seigneurie des Awirs

In the 12th century, the seigneuries of Awirs and Aigremont were united and belonged to a vassal of the Bishop of Liège. In the 13th century, the seigneuries were held by the Limbourg family, and in the 14th century, by the La Marck family. The seigneury had its own court of justice and the village of Chokier.

* Seigneurie de Gleixhe

Gleixhe, formerly Awirs-Notre-Dame, named after the church of the seigneury which venerated the Virgin, was located near the seigneury of Haute-penne, whose castle still exists. It also had its own court of justice.

* Seigneurie de Chokier

The seigneury was held by the family of Hozémont before passing to the Surlet and then to the Berio. Like the other two seigneuries mentioned above, it also had a court of justice.

* Seigneurie d&#x27;Ivoz

It is part of the municipality of Ivoz-Ramet, which includes two other seigneuries. It belonged to the chapter of Saint-Lambert Cathedral and was transferred to the Abbey of Val-Saint-Lambert in 1261. It had a court of justice.

* Seigneurie de Ramet

Like Ivoz, it is part of the municipality of Ivoz-Ramet. It is known to have been a seigneury because several people between the 12th and 13th centuries bore the name Ramet. It had its court of justice.

* Seigneurie de Ramioul

Ramioul, along with Sart-Diable, belonged to the Duke of Lower Lorraine. The seigneury was transferred to the collegiate church of Saint-Servais in Maastricht, donated by Godfrey of Bouillon. It was then transferred to the Abbey of Val-Saint-Lambert in 1236, and later to André de Bincken and finally to the Hemricourt.

* Seigneurie de Mons

Mons, like Souxhon, Ruy, and the two Crotteux (Saint-Martin and Saint-Pierre), belonged to the municipality of Mons-lez-Liège. The seigneury had its court of justice.

==== War of the Awans and the Waroux ====
This war began in 1297 and lasted 38 years. It profoundly marked the history of La Hesbaye, which never recovered from this war. This conflict between seigneuries gained significant magnitude because the Prince-Bishop of Liège was unable to end it.

The war pitted the seigneuries of Awans, Bovenistier, Diepenbeck, Fermes, Fontin, Haneffe, and Hozémont against the seigneuries of Waroux, Berloz, Hermalle, Horion, Jemeppe, and Oborne. This war was fratricidal, meaning that the Awans and the Waroux descended from the same lineage and fought each other. The war began when Adoule, a young maid who was to marry a cousin of the Awans, was abducted by a squire of the Waroux. The war devastated the region completely and led to the rise of the bourgeoisie, the decline of the power of the Prince-Bishop of Liège, and the destruction of several castles, including those of Awans and Waroux. It is Jacques de Hemricourt, through his chronicle, who informs us about this war.

During the period of municipal management, the Chapter of Saint Peter exercised legislative and regulatory power, judicial power (the municipality had its own court of justice), and fiscal power.

=== Modern Times ===
In the 16th century, the small chapel in the village of Chokier was dedicated to Saint Marcellin. It became a parish church in 1592. On the grounds of the Chokier Castle, a farm exploiting several hectares of vineyards appeared in the 17th century. The village also saw the exploitation of alum.
In 1717, Tsar Peter I stopped at Chokier while traveling to Liège. He was welcomed by the mayor with festivities.

In the basin of the Awirs stream, there are traces of alum workings from the 17th and 18th centuries. This alum activity is also found in Flémalle-Haute and Flémalle-Grande, with alum mines exploited from the 16th to the 18th century. This interest in the industry began in the 15th century with the Saint-Pierre chapter that operated numerous quarries. The parish of Saint-Mathias, in 1762, replaced the former.

The church located in Gleixhe, which gave the name Awirs-Notre-Dame to the locality, was destroyed during the Middle Ages. In 1779, it was reconstructed and placed under the authority of the Saint-Lambert Cathedral.

=== Contemporary Era ===

The last alum mine in Awirs, specifically that of Aigremont, closed in 1816, with the last one in the municipality also closing in the 19th century. Still in this locality, coal mining operations began, leading to a prosperous industrial period. The last coal mine in Awirs closed in 1928. This coal industry covered almost the entire territory. The last coal mine in Flémalle closed in 1955.

In 1938, the Ivoz-Ramet barrage bridge was inaugurated. It was dynamited two years later in 1940 to slow the advance of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. It was rebuilt during World War II.

During World War II, like Liège, Flémalle was bombed. A tunnel in Flémalle is reported to have served as a refuge for the population.

==== World War I ====

In August 1914, Belgium was invaded by the German Army; the first city affected was Liège and its region. Despite the numerous fortifications surrounding the city, including Fort of Flémalle, the fortified belt was put out of service. The Netherlands, barely ten kilometers from Liège, became a destination for the region&#x27;s inhabitants to flee the war, as the Dutch were not involved in the conflict.

It was due to this proximity to the Dutch border and specifically the city of Maastricht that the &quot;Atlas V&quot;, an armored tugboat, left the city on the night of 3 to 4 January 1917 with 107 people on board. The expedition to the Netherlands was tumultuous as the Germans began to chase the boat near Argenteau.
Among the four crew members, two were from Flémalle, named Jean Job and Raoul Longueville, and another Flémalle resident among the passengers, Joseph Fagard. The captain was Jules Hentjens.

==== The Water Crossing Accident ====
On 23 January 1918, around 5:30 pm, workers from the Cedauville factory, located on the right bank of the Meuse, residing on the left bank, in Jemeppe and Flémalle-Haute, used a ferry that could hold a maximum of 60 people. There were 80 people rushing onto the ferry. The ferry operator had to make two trips, and it was during this second crossing that the accident occurred.

The hook guiding the ferryboat on the cable broke. Panicked, the workers moved to the front of the boat, causing it to capsize and overturn. Of the 37 passengers, only 4 survived.

==== December 1930 Atmospheric Accident ====

This atmospheric accident is one of the most severe of the time in Europe and still serves as an example of the need for pollution protection. This disaster caused the death of more than 60 people, while around 300 others were injured or fell ill in the following days. The accident occurred in Engis, a neighboring municipality to Flémalle, to the west. It is now considered the most polluted municipality in Belgium, but since 1930, measures have been taken to prevent another such accident.

It was only in 1968 that these measures were implemented with the installation of over 200 atmospheric monitoring stations, controlling levels of sulfur dioxide and black particles.

From 1 to 5 December 1930, a fog stagnated over the Meuse valley, stretching from Jemeppe to Huy. This accident partly occurred due to the morphology of the valley. Indeed, over one to two kilometers wide, the valley&#x27;s height is 60 to 80 meters, while the top of the valley, that is, the plateaus on the right and left banks, reaches more than 200 meters in some places. During this first week of December, atmospheric pressure was extremely high, around 1030 mbar, and it was cold (0 °C during the day and as low as −10 °C at night) with a weak east wind, ranging from one to three km/h. This is referred to as a Temperature inversion.

The inversion caused the coldest air mass to be unable to pass above the warmer one, trapping the fog in the valley and preventing the cold air mass from escaping. The chimneys of the 27 large factories in the valley, not exceeding 70 meters, meant that the pollution could not escape the valley, creating a vicious cycle. This event is comparable to the Great Smog of London in 1952.

The fog dissipated on 5 and 6 December, lasting less than a week, but the damage was done. The sick were affected by severe respiratory failure, as well as cough, heart failure, nausea, vomiting, and tearing. In addition to the human toll, there was an even heavier impact on livestock, with a pig farmer slaughtering his pigs one by one.

The human losses were distributed across the municipalities of Hermalle-sous-Huy, Engis, La Maillieu, Flémalle-Grande, Flémalle-Haute, Vierset, Ivoz-Ramet, Seraing, Jemeppe, and Ougrée. Of the 60 deaths, 20 were in the former municipalities of Flémalle.

==== Railway Accident of 1 December 1946 ====
The railway line from Liège to Namur runs along the back of the village of Chokier, below the promontory where the castle is located. At the time, the castle had a terrace overlooking the Meuse Valley. On 1 December 1946, a rock face collapsed, taking with it the western part of the castle terrace, which fell 80 meters onto the railway tracks below. Fortunately, this accident did not result in any casualties. Just two minutes earlier, a train carrying 400 workers had passed by, while another train was delayed. The accident primarily caused economic damage as the rocks blocked the railway from 1 December 1946, to 15 January 1947. To accommodate travelers, buses were continuously stationed at the Flémalle-Haute station to provide connections.

==== Aviation Accident of December 1989 ====
In December 1989, Pieter Demuynck, a lieutenant pilot, was on a mission aboard a Mirage. A malfunction on the aircraft forced the lieutenant to keep his Mirage in flight to avoid residential areas, and he was flying over the Awirs at the time. He ejected a few moments later but did not survive. However, he managed to avoid a major accident. The plane crashed outside the village, causing only minor damage. A commemorative plaque is located at the site where the lieutenant died.

== Geography ==
=== Sections ===
Flémalle is composed of eight sections: Awirs, Chokier, Flémalle-Grande, Flémalle-Haute, Gleixhe, Ivoz-Ramet, Les Cahottes, and Mons-lez-Liège. The most populated section is Flémalle-Haute, with 6391 inhabitants, while the least populated is Gleixhe, with 260 inhabitants.

==== Localities and hamlets ====
There are around 90 localities and hamlets of various sizes and populations.
==== Les Trixhes ====
The Trixhes plateau was created under the aesthetic vision of urban architects from the L&#x27;Équerre Group. The layout of this neighborhood can be described as a garden city or park city. The project was commissioned by Théodule Gonda, then themayor of Flémalle in 1937, but the first construction sites did not begin until the early 1950s.

The decision to build a neighborhood in such a location was made to open up the municipality, positioning it as a satellite community between Liège and the countryside. Four housing units were constructed, totaling 1,326 units (453 houses and 873 apartments). Two additional units were planned, but a moratorium on social housing in 1982 altered the plans for the Trixhes plateau. This neighborhood is characterized by post-war modernist architecture, with low-rise buildings, single-family homes, a spacious layout with ample greenery, and pedestrian walkways.

During 1979 and 1982, a renovation project for Unit IV was launched. The units in this section suffered from severe humidity problems. The issues were so severe that the unit was eventually demolished. Today, remnants of this unit can still be seen in the southwestern part of the neighborhood. Only the roads and pathways, sidewalks, streetlights, and an abandoned underground parking lot remain.

The units are divided into different neighborhoods to promote social interaction. The area includes sports and cultural centers, as well as squares, a modernist-style church, and an exceptional pedestrian network for the time, with pedestrian tunnels under the national road. The road was initially intended to avoid isolating the neighborhood from the town center, but in recent years, it has become the main link between the valley and the motorway, effectively cutting the neighborhood in two.

==== Chokier ====

The Chokier district has perhaps the richest history in Flémalle. Its castle, perched on a rocky promontory, has existed since the 9th century. In the 13th century, the castle, then a fortress known as Mont Iohy, was sold by the Count of Hozémont to his nephew. In the 18th century, the fortress was transformed into the castle that is visible today.

The village gained recognition in the region as early as the 11th century. It was home to viticulture, a brewery, a cooper, a blacksmith, and inns. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the village experienced industrial growth with the establishment of an alum works, lime kilns, a pipe-making factory, a red lead factory, a starch factory, and a tannery.

==== Les Cahottes ====
In contrast to Chokier, the village of Les Cahottes faced a different fate. This less populated and more prosperous village underwent a wave of expropriation due to development. As a result, today, the village has lost nearly half of its population.

== Location ==

The municipality is located in the east of Belgium, west of Liège, along the Meuse communication axis between France and Germany and between southern and northern Europe. Indeed, at the far north is the European route E42 and the Loncin interchange, located in the municipality of Ans as well as Liège Airport, one of the most important freight airports in Western Europe. Situated along the Meuse, it acts as a buffer municipality between the Meuse valley and the Hesbaye to the north and the Condroz to the south.

In orthodromic distances, it is 10.2 km from Liège (the capital of the Province of Liège), 43 km from Namur (the capital of Wallonia), 81.5 km from Brussels (the capital of Belgium), 24.1 km from the Netherlands (Eijsden), 44.1 km from the tripoint of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands (&quot;Les Trois Bornes&quot;), 60.3 km from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (Troisvierges), 65.1 km from France (Givet), and 172.5 km from the Belgian coast (Knokke-Heist).

=== Bordering municipalities ===


=== Geology and relief ===
The municipality is marked by the Midi Fault (in Belgium, it is called the Sambre and Meuse fault), which is a geological rupture line that appeared in the Paleozoic era. The Eifelian fault, also known as the Midi fault, passes through Flémalle, as designated by Malherbe from Clermont-sous-Huy to Angleur. This fault, still active today, caused the Liège earthquake on 8 November 1983. Thus, the highway to the north of the territory, as well as most of the area and the surrounding agglomerations, such as Liège, Seraing, and Engis, are located on this fault.

The fault shapes the municipality&#x27;s relief, with strong urbanized areas above the cliffs created by the fault, such as Les Trixhes, and also below, with the center of Flémalle. This fault was long exploited by various quarries. Those located behind the village of Chokier gave birth to the &quot;Aux Roches&quot; nature reserve. The municipality&#x27;s altitude ranges from a minimum of 62 m (along the Meuse) to a maximum of 238 m (in the extreme south of the municipality). Although the south is higher than the north, it is in the north that the fault is most noticeable, notably with the Chokier Castle, which is perched on a promontory. Along the Meuse, the terrain is flat, while to the north, the terrain is hilly, particularly in Awirs with the stream; the south experiences a constant elevation rise.

=== Hydrography ===

Flémalle is part of the Lower Meuse sub-basin. The municipality has only one navigable waterway, the Meuse, which traverses the municipality from west to east over a length of 7,646 meters. It has seven main watercourses (excluding the Meuse, these are the Awirs, Ville-en-Cours, Neuville, Pré Renard, Broussou, Bailesse, and Croisette) with a total length of 27,051 meters. The municipality has 4% of its territory designated as flood zones, of which only 2.7% are at high flood risk.

The organization managing the municipality&#x27;s sanitation services is the Association intercommunale pour le démergement et l&#x27;épuration (AIDE). In 2008, 77% of the population&#x27;s domestic wastewater was not treated by a public treatment plant. In the same year, the municipality had a sewer network 158.24 km long.

In 2017, AIDE requested a budget from SPGE (the Public Water Management Company) for a study on the climate resilience of structures located on the left bank of the Meuse, including pumping stations No. 1 and No. 3 in Flémalle, which are old.

Since the winter of 1977–1978, there has been a gradual rise in the water table related to the post-coal mining era in the province of Liège. Flémalle and other municipalities along the Meuse with a mining history are affected by this phenomenon.

==== Islands ====
Before the construction of the quays along the Meuse in 1937, numerous islands of varying sizes were scattered throughout the river. These islands once formed the &quot;Chokier bottleneck&quot;, a challenging section for both upstream and downstream navigation. Before the development works, archaeological remains were found, including gladii, funerary urns, and coins. Some of the islands included Rensonnet, Champs de Bures, Trou des Veaux, Avocat, and one near Ivoz. There were no bridges connecting the shores, so crossing the river was done by boat.

=== Climate ===
According to the Köppen-Geiger classification, Flémalle&#x27;s climate is of type Cfb. On average, the temperature is 10.2 °C. However, attention should be paid to the municipality&#x27;s morphology. The Meuse valley is at a lower altitude than the northern and southern parts of the municipality, which means that during moderate snow periods, snow falls across most of the territory except in the center, that is, along the Meuse where it is warmer.

On average, April is the driest month, with 65 mm of precipitation, while December is the wettest with an average of 99 mm. The temperature curve inversely follows the precipitation curve, with a slight delay. Thus, July is generally the warmest month with an average temperature of 18.1 °C, and the coldest is January with an average temperature of 2.6 °C. On average, it rains 10 days per month in the municipality, slightly more than in Liège.

== Urban planning ==

=== Urban morphology ===

==== Urban fabric ====
The center of Flémalle is part of the continuous urban fabric of Liège, extending from Herstal to the village of Chokier. Almost the entire territory is part of this urban fabric, except for Awirs, Gleixhe, En Cowa, Ramioul, and Gros-Chêne, which are separate. Most of Flémalle&#x27;s institutions are located in the center, mainly along the Grand&#x27;Route. These include the post office (formerly the finance building), the town hall, as well as the main commercial arteries and industrial hubs, while the police station of the zone of Flémalle is located near National Road 677, north of Trixhes. This neighborhood forms a separate urban fabric, with high levels of urbanization.

Before the 1977 merger of Belgian municipalities, the current municipal sections were separate communes, which is why after the merger, institutions like libraries were numerous and spread across the territory. Today, everything has been centralized (two libraries, including a main one). There are still old buildings that once served as town halls. The Chokier district is easily recognizable by its history and architecture. It is often cited as one of the most beautiful villages in Wallonia. The Awirs district is also distinctive, with its castle. The Cultural Center and the main sports and charitable institutions are located south of the Trixhes district.

==== Land Use ====
The table above shows that the municipality is highly urbanized, with an artificial land area and residential land nearly three times higher than those of Wallonia. Services, offices, and commerce also occupy a significant portion of the municipality. In the center of Flémalle, there are several large retailers (Delhaize, Lidl, Aldi), as well as two shopping centers, one to the east of the center, near Jemeppe, and a smaller one to the west of the center at Chaffours. Despite the significantly higher share of residential land compared to the Walloon and provincial averages, recreational areas and green spaces take up less space.

The industrial share is four times higher, which can be explained by the two ArcelorMittal centers located on the left and right banks of the Meuse and of considerable size, as well as the presence of three major industrial hubs: the Les Cahottes Economic Activity Park, the Arbre Saint-Michel Economic Activity Park, and the Ramet Industrial Park.

Despite the high urbanization of the municipality, agriculture occupies a significant portion of the land. Although it is less than the provincial and regional average, when comparing the municipality&#x27;s share to that of Liège or the municipalities in the Liège agglomeration, Flémalle stands out.

Finally, the share of forests is significantly lower, almost half the Walloon average, which can be explained by increasing urbanization, the expansion of economic hubs, and agriculture, leaving little room for forests. Most of them are located in the south and west of the municipality.

=== Housing ===

The share of buildings constructed before the end of World War II (1945) varies greatly between western and eastern Belgium. This is explained by the fact that the Province of Liège often found itself as the first city to face the German armed forces.

Flémalle is one of the municipalities with the highest proportion of buildings constructed between 1946 and 1961 (20.9%), whereas the regional average is no higher than 10.8%. This post-war construction phenomenon is found throughout the Liège region.

This construction trend continued between 1962 and 1970 with 11.5% of buildings erected compared to 7.7% for Wallonia. Since then, construction has decreased in Flémalle and the Liège region. The municipalities in the countryside have experienced a period of construction from the early 1970s to the present day, particularly in the Province of Luxembourg. This phenomenon is not limited to the Liège region but also occurs in Charleroi, Namur, Mons, and other major Walloon cities.

The proportion of buildings and apartment buildings among the housing stock stands at 15.5%. This proportion is expected to increase in the coming years due to the Flémalle-Neuve development project. This share is almost equal to the Walloon average (16.3%).

The Liège region, including Flémalle, has one of the highest proportions of terraced houses among the housing stock in Wallonia. These houses were often former workers&#x27; homes from the coal mining industry during the industrial revolution and the operation of various mines and quarries.

In 2001, the municipality had 10,757 housing units for 25,777 inhabitants.

==== Architecture ====

Liège architecture is distinguished by the Rhenish Romanesque and Mosane style. The Château d&#x27;Aigremont is a beautiful example, in Louis XIV style but mixing the Mosane style with the red bricks found at the Grand Curtius, another specimen of the Mosane style.

The Chokier district has a well-preserved architectural heritage similar to what is found in most important Walloon villages.

The Trixhes represent a new architectural style of the 20th century, the modernist style.

=== Development Projects ===
The municipality is looking to the future with Flémalle 2030. Among the revitalization projects:

* Renovation of the Grand&#x27;Route and its two projects.

The first project, Flémalle-Centre, aims to revitalize the municipal park, the green lung of the town center, as well as create a new public space at the Athénée Provincial Guy Lang and the Tubemeuse polyclinic (Bois de l&#x27;Abbaye Hospital), located across from each other. This project includes the creation and reorganization of parking areas, with the initial offer being very limited. This will enhance the town center where schools, shops, the library, the socio-economic center, municipal administrations, the Flémalle-Centre police station, the municipal park, and the fire station are located.

The second project, concerning Flémalle-Grande, will revitalize the S. Donnay square, the &quot;Flémalle Shopping&quot; shopping center, and parking areas.

* Flémalle-Neuve

This project aims to redevelop an area behind the Tubemeuse and includes the creation of 238 housing units (184 apartments and 54 houses), a new municipal school, and new offices as well as SMEs. The area will also have a new railway station on the Line 125A towards Seraing and Liège, as well as a footbridge over the Meuse, next to the railway bridge.

This project is currently in the study phase with a study on land pollution. It is estimated at around 72 million euros.

* Modernization of the Trixhes

This modernization project is intended to redevelop the entire district, including various roads and pedestrian areas, improving commercial, cultural, and social offerings, and addressing the high demand for housing in Flémalle. The neighborhoods of Unit IV have been vacant for several years but are still developable. The XV Bonniers will see about thirty new housing units.

* Eco-neighborhood of Mons-lez-Liège

Since the demolition of the old municipal school located at Place Mottard, the neighborhood has experienced disorganization despite its densification. The project aims to redevelop this square, with the creation of shops and housing, as well as a more sustainable mobility around the square. In fact, a whole eco-neighborhood will be created.

* Sustainable Urban Development with sustainable methods

Flémalle aims to implement sustainable development methods by managing various aspects of urban planning and the environment, including the development of eco-districts and promotion of green spaces.

During the removal of the ashes, Engie found asbestos and therefore decontaminated the site. This discovery worried local residents who feared the possible consequences for their health but analyses showed that asbestos was present in low quantities and posed no risk. The asbestos is being treated, and clean soil is separated from asbestos-contaminated soil.

The mayor of Engis, Serge Manzato, participates in the meetings of the Steering Committee. Indeed, the Hénâ site is located right next to the municipality of Engis.

In March 2016, 50% of the first phase of the work was completed. In April 2016, the conveyor belt began to be constructed (a helicopter was present for some maneuvers of the large-scale project) and air quality checks started and will be carried out throughout the project. In May 2017, 2% of the ashes were removed, which represents 20 barges. In October 2017, 4% of the ashes were removed and 63 barges departed for cement manufacturers. In January 2018, more than 5% of the ashes were removed, filling 100 barges. In June 2018, 170,000 tonnes were evacuated. In March 2019, 285,000 tonnes were evacuated. In November 2019, 420,000 tonnes were evacuated, representing 18% of the ashes, with 285 barges sent to the Liège cement manufacturers.

=== Industrial Risks and Pollution ===
In 2009, there were no SEVESO sites in the municipality. The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) listed four sites: ArcelorMittal Steel Belgium S.A. Eurogal (metal surface treatment); ArcelorMittal Steel Belgium S.A. Flémalle Ramet (galvanization); Electrabel Centrale des Awirs (combustion); Segal S.A. (hot-dip galvanizing of steel sheets). In 2004, there were two nuclear zones distributed across the municipal territory.

In 2007 and 2009, there was a site to be redeveloped (SAR) whose cleanup was recognized as a priority (Cokerie Flémalle), five landfills of which three were unrehabilitated, and five service stations with potentially contaminated soil out of 12 service stations.

=== Transportation and Communication Routes ===
Flémalle is a municipality located a few kilometers from Liège and Seraing, situated in an important urban and economic hub. To the north of the municipality is the European route E42, which separates the municipality from the Liège Airport, in the center, the developed quays of the Meuse, and to the south, a national road connecting the Condroz municipalities.

==== Road Network ====
The road network in Flémalle is quite unique. The main connections run from west to east, with some major roads extending from the left bank of the Meuse to the north and only one running from the Meuse to the south of the municipality. The rest of the network, both tertiary and secondary, revolves around the various urban and economic hubs of the region. In the eastern part of the territory, a more complete secondary and tertiary network is found due to its proximity to Seraing.

The Walloon Motorway acts as a border with Grâce-Hollogne. The National Route 677 connects the entire municipality to the motorway, via exit 4 (Flémalle), which also allows passage under the motorway to reach the airport and Horion-Hozémont. This same national road serves Mons-lez-Liège and Les Cahottes via a roundabout, Les Trixhes and the center of Flémalle, and continues to Ivoz-Ramet passing over the weir. It climbs up the south of Flémalle, known as Route de France, passing through Gros-Chêne. It ends at the intersection with Route du Condroz (N63) just past the center of Neuville-en-Condroz. A 2x2 lane tunnel allows passage under the Thier des Trixhes.

National Route 90, which connects Huy to Liège, runs along the right bank of the municipality. It connects Engis to the ArcelorMittal site in Ramet, Ivoz, the center of Seraing, and Liège. National Route 617 connects Engis to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse, passing by the Tubemeuse site of the ArcelorMittal group, known as Quai du Halage. With this national road and National Route 90, Chaussée de Ramioul, continuing from those of Ramet and Ivoz, also follows a west-to-east direction and connects Engis to Ramioul, Ramet, and Ivoz to Val Saint-Lambert, Seraing.

Other significant routes include Rue des Awirs (connecting Engis to Awirs up to Hozémont passing through Gleixhe under the motorway), Rue d&#x27;Otet (connecting Les Trixhes to the Awirs), Rue de l&#x27;Alouette, Jean-Louis Adam, E&#x27;Tiyou, Harckay (connecting exit 4 to Jemeppe passing through Mons-lez-Liège), Rue du Thier Saint-Léonard (connecting Mons-lez-Liège to Hollogne-aux-Pierres), Rue de Flémalle-Grande and Rue de la Fontaine (forming a large roundabout in one-way traffic connecting the bottom of Flémalle-Grande to Profondval), and Grand&#x27;Route (serving the entire center of Flémalle).
The town of Flémalle commissioned the sculptor Robin Vokaer to create a masterful piece, Le Cœur in steel, installed at exit 4 of the E42 highway. (GPS Coordinates: 50°37’28.5″N 5°25’46.2″E). 

==== Bridges ====

Despite the reasonable width of the Meuse River, only two bridges span the river within Flémalle&#x27;s territory: the Ivoz-Ramet dam bridge and a railway bridge. Another bridge, the Val Saint-Lambert bridge, once spanned the Meuse but was destroyed. A footbridge is expected to be put into service after the construction of the new Flémalle-Neuve neighborhood. Besides these bridges, the Engis bridge, located a little over 500 meters west of the municipality, can be mentioned.

The Ivoz-Ramet dam bridge is a structure built between the 1960s and 1980s; the initial structures were destroyed during World War II. The dam bridge was not yet a bridge but was equipped only with locks. On the left bank of the Meuse, there is a hydroelectric power station fed by the dam. It is the most frequented hydraulic structure in the Walloon navigable network. Between 2010 and 2014, it was renovated to allow for increasing river traffic.

The railway bridge supports both freight train and passenger train traffic. The bridge crosses the Meuse and the Quai du Halage, heading towards the Tubemeuse site of ArcelorMittal, the Flémalle-Haute and Leman stations, towards Flémalle, and the Seraing station, towards Seraing.

The Val Saint-Lambert bridge was a stone bridge built by the Compagnie du Nord Belge in 1846. The bridge was a railway bridge with a unique feature, a toll for pedestrians crossing to work at the Cristalleries.

The only drivable bridge in the municipality is separated by orthodromic distances of 4.1 km from the Engis bridge and 4.5 km from the Seraing bridge.

==== Rail Network ====

Flémalle is at the junction of the railway lines from Namur to Liège and Liège to Flémalle. The Flémalle-Haute station is the only station on the Flémalle-Liège line, while the Namur-Liège line has three Flémalle stations. Between 2003 and 2005, an average of 1,292 passengers used the Flémalle stations, and in 2006, there were 1,523.

Flémalle-Haute station is operated by the National Railway Company of Belgium (SNCB) and is served by InterCity (IC), Suburbans (S), Omnibus (L), and Peak Hour (P) trains. The passenger building is the only one of its kind in Belgium, although similar buildings exist in some regions of France (such as Estrées-Saint-Denis station). It was inaugurated on 18 November 1850. Since the building has been empty for several years, an urban development project has been proposed, and housing is expected.

The Leman station is served by Omnibus (L) and Peak Hour (P) trains. It is located at kilometer point (PK) 10.0 on the Liège to Namur line, just after Flémalle-Haute station. It is named Leman in honor of General Leman, a Liège hero of World War I.

The Flémalle-Grande station is served by the same trains as Leman station and is located at kilometer point (PK) 9.3 on the same line preceding Leman station. The following station is Jemeppe-sur-Meuse. The station is located near a shopping center with a Carrefour, a Krëfel, a Lunch Garden, and other stores.

In the Flémalle-Neuve development project, a new station will be built on the Liège-Seraing-Flémalle line, making it the fourth station in the municipality over 5.7 km of railways, or one station approximately every 1.5 km.

These two lines provide access to the Guillemins station in Liège in about ten minutes. Given that this station is a major railway hub in the country, it can be concluded that Flémalle stations are well served.

The municipality has two level crossings, one of minor importance and the other cutting Chokier in two. The latter is problematic. It is the third most accident-prone level crossing in Belgium; over the past ten years, there have been four accidents, two of which were fatal. Infrabel, which manages the railway network infrastructure, would like to remove the level crossing by creating a tunnel a few hundred meters further, but the municipality is opposed to this project because the part of the village on the north side of the railway would be isolated from the rest of the municipality. The mayor, Isabelle Simonis, said that &quot;removing the level crossing [...] seems to be a radical solution&quot;. The controversy surrounding the level crossing dates back to Sunday, 10 January 2016, when a woman was struck by a train. This fatal accident sparked a debate since it was not the first fatal accident. The level crossing provides access to Houlbouse Street, which is frequently used as a shortcut to descend from the Trixhes plateau.

==== Air Network ====

Liège Airport is located to the north of the municipality, less than 100 meters away, in the territory of Grâce-Hollogne. Primarily focused on cargo transport, the airport also offers a few tourist destinations, which have been declining year by year. Indeed, cargo handling has become increasingly significant at the airport, making it the seventh-largest airport for cargo in Europe. Due to its geographical location between Paris, Brussels, Antwerp, Rotterdam, the Ruhr region, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, the airport has become a hub and was chosen as a reference hub for Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, and was awarded the title of &quot;Best Cargo Airport in the World for 2020&quot; that same year.

Flémalle benefits economically from this with several economic and industrial zones, including the Arbre Saint-Michel zone, a few hundred meters from the airport, where transportation companies, online businesses, and large companies like Mithra are located.

In addition to the economic development of the municipality, some local areas, such as Les Cahottes or En Cowâ, experience noise pollution from both the highway and the airport. The consequences are visible when walking through the streets of Cahottes, with many abandoned houses bought by the airport and some demolished. One of the most striking consequences is the abandonment and destruction of the village of Rouvroy in Grâce-Hollogne, located on the other side of the highway.

This noise pollution tends to drive residents away from these areas; some have moved to Donceel, but airport development has brought noise there as well.

==== Waterway Network ====

Flémalle is traversed from east to northeast by the Meuse. The river provided strong economic appeal to the municipality in the past, with activities related to coal mining, coal mines, and the metallurgy and steel industry. In addition to this rich history, the municipality today experiences another form of activity along the Meuse. Indeed, as the decline of ArcelorMittal&#x27;s sectors accelerates in Belgium, the municipality has turned towards the autonomous port of Liège, the third-largest river port in Europe. Therefore, redevelopment work was carried out between 2010 and 2014 on the Ivoz-Ramet weir, to streamline river traffic and allow the passage of larger vessels.

The Flémalle port areas associated with the autonomous port of Liège are the Awirs port (left bank), the Flémalle port (right bank), and the Ivoz-Ramet port (right bank) shared with Seraing.

The Meuse is bordered on both sides by National road 617 and 90. Upstream and downstream along the Meuse, you can find the quarry Carmeuse Engis (the port is located in Engis, and quarrying is on both communes), the biomass power plant of the Awirs (left bank, currently being converted into a gas power plant), the Yacht Ski Club Flémalle (left bank), the Intermunicipal Waste Treatment Association of the Liège Region (right bank, along the dock), Segal, ArcelorMittal, and Arceo (right bank, near the dock), Inter Beton (left bank), the Ivoz-Ramet weir with its two locks and the hydroelectric plant (left bank), the Arcelor group and an economic center with several industries (left bank), and the Ivoz-Ramet port (right bank).

The Meuse is the only navigable river in the municipality.

==== Cycling Network ====
The cycling network in the municipality is poorly arranged due to the topography of the area. Only the lower part, the Trixhes plateau, and the Awirs center would be easily navigable by bike.

The RAVeL network is present in the municipality, with the RV8b connection, a road link running behind the railway south of Awirs, going up to National road 617 to Chokier, and then following the railway line up to Jemeppe via small roads in the municipality. There is also the EV19 connection, from Engis to the weir, passing through Ramioul, Ramet, and Ivoz. The most important cycle path is the RAVeL along the Meuse, partially following the quays up to Engis, connecting Namur to Liège. This RAVeL shares its cycle path with the EuroVelo 3, linking Trondheim (Norway) to Santiago de Compostela (Spain).

There are several paved and unpaved paths throughout the municipality, allowing for relative accessibility for short trips.

There are several cycling clubs of all types in Flémalle.

==== Pedestrian Network ====
There are pedestrian networks in some areas of the municipality. For example, in Trixhes, there is a particularly developed network in the city, passing under National road 677 to connect with other nearby places. There are other paths outside Trixhes connecting cul-de-sacs to the rest of the road network. In the project to redevelop the town center, significant emphasis is given to pedestrians. Sidewalks are generally well-maintained.

==== Public Transport Network ====
Flémalle is served by numerous bus lines operated by TEC. There are five terminal zones: Arbre Saint-Michel, the cultural center, Chaffours, Gros-Chêne, and the Cité. The lines connect to Liège, Seraing, Boncelles, the bus station in Jemeppe, the center of Flémalle, Amay, Saint-Georges, Huy, the Fagnes (Engis), Verlaine, and other medium-sized hubs. The territory east of National road 677, Les Trixhes, Chokier, and Ivoz are in zone 20, allowing easy transit to Liège and its most populous suburbs, while the rest of the municipality, i.e., west of the national road, Ramioul, Ramet, and Gros-Chêne, is located in zones 30 and 37 of the network. All lines are part of the TEC Liège-Verviers subsidiary. In 2009, there were 86 bus stops distributed across the territory.

=== Former Public Transport Networks ===
==== Liège Vicinal Tramway ====
The vicinal tramway was a former tramway network connecting Liège and its suburbs. The only line passing through Flémalle was the one from Jemeppe to Hannut, which passed through Mons-lez-Liège, then known as Mons-Crotteux. It was in service between 1905 and 1906 and was discontinued on 13 September 1959.

The line also passed through Fexhe-le-Haut-Clocher, Engis, Ampsin, and Verlaine.

A street in Mons-lez-Liège is named &quot;rue du Vicinal&quot; and provided access to the former coal mines of Arbre-Saint-Michel. A vicinal stop was located in Les Cahottes.

==== Liège-Seraing Economic Railways and Extensions (RELSE) ====
The Liège-Seraing Economic Railways and Extensions company was established in 1881 and disappeared in 1961. The line between Liège, Seraing, and Flémalle was newly opened in 1941 and closed 20 years later.

The line connected Place de la République française to Flémalle-Haute station.

==== Seraing Trolleybus ====
Flémalle was served by two trolleybus lines operated by the Liège-Seraing Economic Railways and Extensions (RELSE). One line connected the center of Seraing to Place François Gérard in Ivoz-Ramet, opposite the weir, and the other line connected the place to the Prayon Rupel factory in Engis and Saint-Georges-sur-Meuse.

The line connecting to the Prayon Rupel factory crossed the weir, passed in front of Flémalle-Haute station, and went through the village of Chokier.

== Politics ==
Flémalle, as the municipality exists since the 1977 municipal merger, has had four mayors, three men and one woman. These four mayors were or are members of the Socialist Party. Indeed, Liège and its region, including Flémalle, are a red stronghold, meaning that most politics is centered around the PS which is the majority in almost all municipalities (10 out of 24 in the Liège administrative arrondissement are not predominantly PS: Aywaille, Chaudfontaine, Dalhem, Esneux, and Neupré have an MR majority, Bassenge has a Democratic Humanist Centre and MR majority, Comblain-au-Pont is predominantly cdH although governed under the Communal Interests like Fléron, Juprelle, and Soumagne. Thus, the suburbs of Liège are sometimes referred to as the Red Belt.

In recent years, the Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium (PTB) has seen a surge in votes in the municipality and in Wallonia. The Reformist Movement (MR), while popular in some municipalities of the arrondissement due to Didier Reynders, a national-level politician born in Liège and a member of MR, has only managed to secure one seat out of the 29 in the municipality.

The municipality is thus situated on the left side of the political spectrum with the PS in the leading position, securing more than half of the seats (17 out of 29), followed by the PTB (5 seats), Ecolo (3 seats), the IC (3 seats), and the MR (1 seat).
=== List of Mayors ===
* André Cools, from 1977 to 1991: André Cools was a politician born in Flémalle who held a prominent place in Belgian politics, serving as Minister of Budget, Deputy Prime Minister, President of the Belgian Socialist Party, and President of the Walloon Parliament. He was mayor of the municipality from the merger until his assassination on 18 July 1991 in Liège.
* Jean Beulers, from 1991 to 2000: Jean is the son of Hubert Beulers, a Walloon socialist politician.

The twinning with Piombino was initiated by a Piombinese who moved to Flémalle. The project was accepted by the mayor at the time, André Cools. This twinning was based on tourist and cultural exchanges between the Tuscan municipality and the Mosane municipality. The 40th anniversary of the twinning was celebrated in 2011.

The twinning with Basiliano, a municipality in Friuli Venezia Giulia, is more recent. It originated from the initiative of several residents who had been organizing sports exchanges for over 30 years. The twinning charter was signed on 7 December 2017.

The municipality has also created a partnership with the municipality of N&#x27;Djili in the Democratic Republic of Congo as part of an International Municipal Cooperation (IMC) program.

== Demographics and Society ==
=== Demographics ===

As of 2024, the municipality was the 101st most populous in Belgium. In 2024, it was the 26th most populous in Wallonia and the 5th in the province of Liège.

Taking into account the former municipalities involved in the 1977 municipal merger, the population trend is as follows:

&quot;The figures for the years 1846, 1900, and 1947 include the figures for former merged municipalities.&quot;

It is noted that from 1995 to 2008, the population of Flémalle decreased, losing nearly 2000 inhabitants during this period. However, from 2008 to 2020, the population grew consistently, with significant growth particularly from 2008 to 2014. This demographic growth is a general trend observed across Belgium. From 2008 to 2014, Belgium&#x27;s population increased by nearly 500.000 inhabitants, a rise of about 5%. However, from 2014 onward, this growth has slowed, and the population of Flémalle has tended to stabilize with some slight increases.

=== Society ===

Information about local organizations and other social elements such as the number of inhabitants are available in related sections of the articles concerning the municipality and its local institutions.

=== Socio-economics ===

==== Average Income ====
In 2018, the average income per inhabitant in neighboring municipalities was, in ascending order and in euros, 14,275 for Seraing, 15,645 for Grâce-Hollogne, 15,907 for Engis, 18,182 for Saint-Georges-sur-Meuse, and 24,855 for Neupré. The people of Flémalle earn 16,553 euros, placing them between Engis and Grâce-Hollogne, while the national average is 18,768 euros, with Neupré being the only municipality exceeding this average by a significant margin.

This socio-economics is comparable to other urban regions in the country where generally, people with lower incomes live in suburban areas, such as Seraing or Grâce-Hollogne, while wealthier populations prefer to live outside the city on higher grounds, as seen in Neupré and Saint-Georges-sur-Meuse. This socio-economic phenomenon is also noticeable in Seraing, where the poorest population is located in the lower part of the municipality, i.e., the center, Ougrée, and Jemeppe-sur-Meuse, while the wealthier population resides in Boncelles.

The difference between Neupré and Flémalle is 8,302 euros, while the difference with Seraing is 2,275 euros. The average income per inhabitant in Flémalle increased by 3% compared to 2018 and has been rising annually since 2005.

==== Real Estate Prices ====
In 2018, there were 12,197 buildings in Flémalle, accounting for 22.5% of the territory being built. Among these buildings, there are apartments, townhouses, and Villas with a median price of 158,000 euros (235,000 for open-type villas, 158,000 for apartments, and 150,000 for closed or semi-closed type houses).

The national average for closed or semi-closed type houses is 216,500 euros and 315,000 euros for open-type villas. The real estate prices are thus below the national average. This can be explained by very low real estate prices in Wallonia compared to Flanders and the Brussels-Capital Region.

The Flemish banks are located along the &quot;Grand&#x27;Route&quot;, the main economic artery of the municipality with all its small shops and large chains situated nearby. In the center, there are a Belfius bank, a BNP Paribas Fortis, a Falemo, a Fintro, an ING, a NagelMackers, and a Scazzi. However, Flemish banks are gradually disappearing with the advent of electronic payment and technological advances. The COVID-19 crisis has shown this with appointments only via telephone or video conferencing. Electronics are thus undoubtedly the future of banking.

=== Commerce ===
The municipality has about ten supermarkets specializing in food, such as a Delhaize, a Carrefour hypermarket, a Lidl, and a Spar.

The Carrefour Market, which is currently located on the Trixhes plateau in the new development along the national road, was previously in the center, a few steps from the hypermarket. The municipality wants to establish the Cultural center of Flémalle in the former Carrefour premises, which is poorly known to residents due to its poor location and design. The building is currently in a state of abandonment.

=== Socio-economics ===
==== Land Prices ====

=== Tourism ===

Tourism in Flémalle is very diverse, ranging from the Prehistomuséum to open churches or the fort. Several organizations, committees, and enthusiasts help with tourism and the history of Flémalle. For example, the &quot;Les Amis Marcheurs d&#x27;Ivoz&quot; club introduces visitors to the village of Ivoz and the greenery of the municipality, which citizens find difficult to grasp, focusing only on the town center and its commercial parks.

As of 31 December 2018, Flémalle had about ten beds compared to an average of 281 beds in Walloon municipalities. Flémalle is one of the municipalities with the fewest beds in Wallonia.

==== Chokier ====
The village of Chokier is a major tourist attraction in Flémalle. The village is unique, as is its church and castle. The latter partially burned in a fire, which triggered a wave of sadness among the Flémalle residents who see it daily, overlooking the Meuse from its rocky promontory.

In this village, one can find lime kilns and quarries. On top of the village, in the fields behind the castle, it is thought that a Roman villa is buried under the land.

It has become a museum open to the public on the first Saturday and third Sunday of each month. Recently, the museum has modernized and now offers a virtual reality tour of the fort.

==== Nature Reserves ====
Two nature reserves are located in the municipality: Aux Roches and Rognac.

The first, created in 1996 by Natagora, covers an area of 27.13 ha and features a Mediterranean climate. The site&#x27;s geology was formed through the extraction of limestone in the village of Chokier from Roman times until the 20th century, with three quarries, the most impressive of which was still operational in the 1950s; this is the one visible from the Meuse basin. Among the fauna and flora observed here are the Peregrine falcon, the Eurasian eagle-owl, the Apennine rock-rose, and the hairy fruit salad.

The second reserve, created in 1978, covers 12.1 ha. This reserve is a so-called strict reserve, meaning it is left as it is with no human intervention allowed. In terms of fauna and flora, one can observe the Eurasian goshawk, the Eurasian kingfisher, the Fire salamander, and the Epipactis helleborine.

==== Tailings Dumps ====
From its industrial and mining past, the municipality is rich in tailings dumps that over time have become genuine biotopes.

The largest Flemish tailings dump is that of Xhorré, classified as a Site of Major Biological Interest (SGIB) by Wallonia. The dump is wooded but also features thermophilic meadows. Its area is 15.78 ha. In terms of fauna and flora, one can observe the Common slowworm, the Spotted fritillary, the European stag beetle, the Striped katydid, and the Medlar.

The church bells were removed (except one) by the Germans during World War II. In 1951, it was decided to add new ones. In 1955, the bell that was not removed by the Germans was melted down to make six new bells that compose the new carillon. Thus, it is the only church in the municipality to have a carillon.

The current stained glass windows were installed by Monsignor Zuylen in 1955.

The church belongs to the pastoral unit of Aigremont-Saint-Matthias and the Diocese of Liège.

* Église Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Flémalle
The church belongs to the pastoral unit of Saint Roch and the Diocese of Liège.

The church was built between 1878 and 1882 and was consecrated on 23 May 1882. It was initially dedicated to Saint Mary before being dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. This church has been in a dilapidated state for several years following the decommissioning of the site.

Between 6 and 21 July 2015, several thefts were committed within the church. Two residents of Flémalle stole the pipes of the organ dating from 1596, which was said to be &quot;priceless&quot;, and sold them online for a small amount of money.

* Church of Saint Lambert of Mons-lez-Liège

The church belongs to the Saint Roch pastoral unit and the Diocese of Liège.

The first mention of a place of worship at this site is a single-nave chapel that was expanded with a second nave. In the 11th century, a tower was added, and in the 12th century, a circular choir was added, though no reliable sources confirm this.

In 1568, it was destroyed and then rebuilt in 1587, but it was destroyed again in 1637 before being rebuilt in 1672. It was again destroyed in 1704 and rebuilt in 1750.

The church tower, in Romanesque style, dates from the 13th century or 14th century, but no reliable sources confirm this. The rest of the church, in Neo-Romanesque style, dates from 1952, rebuilt after the destruction of the church due to the subsidence of the mining ground beneath it.

* Church of the Virgin of the Poor of Profondval

It belongs to the Saint Roch pastoral unit and the Diocese of Liège.

This church is modern compared to other Flémalle churches. It was built around 1959 by L. Bertrand and dedicated to the Virgin of the Poor. It was constructed of stone and cement.

* Church of Saint Joseph of Ivoz

It belongs to the Engis pastoral unit and the Diocese of Liège.

The free fundamental school of Saint Joseph is associated with it.

* Church of Saint Peter and Paul of Ramet

The church belongs to the Engis pastoral unit and the Diocese of Liège.

It was built in the 18th century with brick and rough-cast limestone. An enclosed and disused cemetery adjoins the church.

=== Chapels ===

The municipality has numerous chapels, crucifixes, grottoes, and wayside crosses on its territory, approximately fifty in total.
=== Cemeteries ===

The municipality has 14 cemeteries: the &quot;La Fontaine&quot; cemetery, the Tapeines cemetery, the old Ivoz-Ramet cemetery, the Ivoz-Ramet cemetery, the Awirs Church cemetery, the Awirs cemetery, the Mons-lez-Liège 1 cemetery, the Mons-lez-Liège 2 cemetery, the Mons-lez-Liège 3 cemetery, the Flémalle-Haute Church cemetery, the Flémalle-Grande cemetery, the Chokier cemetery, the Cahottes cemetery, and the Gleixhe cemetery.

* Tapeines Cemetery

The cemetery includes a scattering area for ashes. It contains a war memorial. Marcel Cools and his wife are buried there; Marcel being the father of André Cools, former mayor of Flémalle. He died in 1942 at Mauthausen on 15 August 1942.

* Ivoz-Ramet Cemetery

The cemetery includes a scattering area for ashes and a columbarium. It features a monument to the heroes in memory of the centenary festivities in 1930 for victims of 1830 during the revolution. A commemorative plaque from World War II honors civilian victims and lists 29 names. Another war memorial honors victims of both World Wars. Another commemorative plaque honors the dead of World War II (10 names listed) and a plaque honoring soldiers who died during World War I (18 names listed, including two civilians). Another plaque lists the names of seven civilians who died during World War II.

* Awirs Church Cemetery

Often called the &quot;old Awirs cemetery&quot; compared to the more recent cemetery nearby, this cemetery dates back to the Middle Ages and is located around the Saint-Etienne Church of Awirs. For several centuries, burials were &quot;coemeterium&quot;, meaning entire generations of families were buried in the same grave.

The cemetery was owned by the church until the 19th century, and it decided who could be buried within the walls. Excommunicated, suicides, duel victims, and those without baptism were buried in &quot;li fâ ête&quot;, or the false cemetery, located in the priest&#x27;s wood.

The oldest known graves are those of the &quot;de Durmarche&quot; (1595) and the &quot;Nihoule&quot; (1597). A tombstone with a piece of heraldry was found in this cemetery and is believed to belong to Marguerite de La Marck-Arenberg or Catherine de Oest d&#x27;Aigremont. However, the wealthier individuals could afford to be buried inside the church, such as Charles Boesmans, who died in 1633, priest Noël Pagnoul in 1690, and the lord of Waarge.

Following the Napoleonic decree of 12 June 1804, it is now forbidden to bury anyone within the walls of a church, but it is now possible to purchase a concession and erect a monument in the cemetery if one can afford it. However, this decree transfers the cemetery&#x27;s oversight from the church to the municipality, which assumes all responsibilities.

In the 19th century, during a period of demographic boom, the cemetery increasingly ran out of space, not to mention the numerous graves with perpetual concessions. The church urgently needed to purchase new plots to expand the now too-small cemetery. Thus, in 1941, another extension of the cemetery was considered by architect Jean Meuris, but this project never materialized. However, in 1952, a new, larger cemetery was inaugurated a bit further away in the village.

Following the collapse of part of the old cemetery&#x27;s walls on the night of 30 November 1998 to 1 December 1998, several village residents, with the support of the non-profit association Qualité-Village-Wallonie, mobilized to preserve what remained of the cemetery. In 2016, an &quot;insect hotel&quot; was created in the cemetery. At the beginning of 2020, the cemetery was on its way to being certified.

Thanks to the cemetery&#x27;s redevelopment project, the village was awarded the Qualité-Village-Wallonie Trophy in 2007. The cemetery is open and tours are organized during heritage days.

* Mons-lez-Liège Cemetery 3
Mons-lez-Liège Cemetery 3 is located in Mons-lez-Liège. It should not be confused with the old Mons-lez-Liège Cemetery (Mons-lez-Liège Cemetery 1) located further along &quot;rue Jean Barthélemy&quot; and the Mons-lez-Liège Cemetery 2 (known as the &quot;Souxhon Cemetery&quot;) located in Souxhon.

Jean-Louis Adam is buried in this cemetery, a notable figure in the village of Mons-lez-Liège. One of the village&#x27;s main streets is named after him. Several war memorials are located in the cemetery.

Here lie, among others, Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo, victims of Marc Dutroux. A memorial to them has been erected at the entrance of the cemetery. They were abducted on 24 June 1995 in Grâce-Hollogne. Numerous protests took place throughout Belgium and Europe, including the &quot;White Marches&quot;, as well as a parliamentary commission, the reform of the police and gendarmerie, new institutions, and the Child Focus association.

* Flémalle-Haute Church Cemetery

A World War I war memorial and several individual graves are located here. Several plaques and names were added to the memorial to honor the dead of World War II.

== Heritage ==
=== Architectural Heritage ===
Flémalle has 15 listed heritage monuments and sites, including Aigremont Castle and the Schmerling Caves. Of course, there are other important monuments in Flémalle that are not listed as heritage sites.

Aigremont Castle is a construction dating back to around 900 and appears in various epic poems such as the Song of the Four Sons of Aymon or the Song of Maugis d&#x27;Aigremont. The castle is named after one of the protagonists of these legends: Beuves d&#x27;Aigremont. Briefly, the castle belonged to the Church of Liège before being acquired in 1715 by canon Mathias Clercx. He turned the castle into a pleasure residence, which is why, today, there are few fortifications around the fortress. It was during this time that the castle acquired its current appearance, a style typical of Liège architecture, though there is some mix with Louis XIV style. The interior of the castle contrasts with the exterior, featuring fine woodwork and frescoes. To the east, there are French gardens.

Further east from Aigremont, on a rocky promontory, is Chokier Castle. The choice to build a structure at this location dates back to Ancient Rome where remains of a Roman villa have been discovered a few hundred meters from the top of the rock. The course of the Meuse River near the village of Chokier is relatively recent as it was only after the limestone quarries in the Aux Roches Nature Reserve were exploited by Saint Peter that the village began to form by pushing the Meuse shoreline towards Ivoz-Ramet. Therefore, before the shoreline advanced, an advanced post, the fortress of Mont Iohy, was located where the castle stands today. Indeed, it is thanks to the construction of the village of Chokier and thus a crossing of the Meuse on the left bank that the advanced post lost its effectiveness and became a pleasure castle in the 18th century. 

After the War of Awans and Waroux, the castle gained fame in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège: Guillaume de Hozémont, in 1298, after the war, saw his castle razed; he settled in Rouveroy and sold Hozémont, which included Chokier, to his cousin Jean de Rulant, who was then the marshal of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, the supreme commander of the armies of the Prince in wartime and supreme judge in peacetime. The Rulant family&#x27;s passage to Surlet was through Jean&#x27;s daughter, who married a certain Jean Surlet. In 1345, the castle was burned by the Hutois, Liégeois, and Dinant people. After the Surlets, the Chabot family held the castle. Filled with a rich history, including a stay by Peter the Great, the castle caught fire on 27 March 2017 due to the electric blanket of the chatelaine. The castle in its current form is neoclassical. The tower located to the west of the castle dates from the late Middle Ages. The interior, especially in the entrance hall, is in Empire style and for a good reason: a general of the Napoleonic Army lived in the castle for several years.

The castle is also thought to appear in several famous paintings; for instance, it might be depicted at the center of Jan van Eyck&#x27;s painting &quot;The Virgin of Chancellor Rolin&quot;, in the third bend of the Meuse River, formerly the fortress of Mont Iohy. Also by Jan van Eyck, the fortress might appear in the illumination of &quot;The Birth of Saint John the Baptist&quot; in &quot;The Très Belles Heures of Notre-Dame&quot;, also at the center of the image. In 1567, Lucas van Valckenborch also depicted the fortress in a view of Liège. Less likely, but inspired by &quot;The Virgin of Chancellor Rolin&quot;, the castle might be associated with the following paintings: &quot;The Holy Anne Brotherhood&quot; by Quentin Metsys and &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saint John the Baptist&quot; by Bernaert van Orley.

In an English cottage style, the Château de la Croix Saint-Hubert was built in the 19th century on a green space by Emmanuel Hallet, a native of Binche. It was Charles Joseph Chaudoir who gave it its current appearance. This castle is privately owned but can be easily seen from walks around it.

Resembling a cadastral farmhouse, the Château de Hautepenne, or Haultepenne, is a castle located in Gleixhe, not far from Warfusée and Rouvroy, in a partially private wooded area. The oldest part of the castle is a keep dating back to 1330, probably built by Lambert de Harduemont. The rest of the building, constructed in an &quot;L&quot; shape, dates from the 17th century and 18th century. Its style is Liège Renaissance, although the most visible part is the wing built in the 18th century in a Louis XV style at the request of the Duke of Arenberg (the family owning the estate at that time). This castle notably served as a refuge for Guillaume de La Marck when he had to flee from Aigremont, which was being attacked by the troops of Prince Louis de Bourbon.

The Château de la Petite Flémal&#x27; is well-known in the municipality as it houses the municipal services. In 1614, Michel Valkener purchased a property to build his pleasure residence. The castle was expanded with a wing between 1710 and 1738, and then with a second wing after the castle was acquired by the municipality. In 2020, the interior of the castle was fully renovated. A garden, the municipal park, is located behind the castle.

The construction of the Château de Ramet is said to date back to the 13th century. This castle, accompanied by a &quot;U&quot;-shaped courtyard is built with a mix of sandstone, limestone, bricks, and cut stone. The castle is completely surrounded by moats still filled with water, with access to the courtyard via a small stone bridge. Remacle Le Loup created an engraving of the castle and its surroundings in 1738.

Finally, the Château de Ramioul, a large three-story castle with an average height of 12 meters, was built around 1840. It features an 18th-century gatehouse, with the rest mainly dating from the 19th century. The castle is in excellent condition due to the geriatrics activity it houses. The Fort de Flémalle is a large trapezoidal fort. Located on the former commune of Flémalle-Grande, overlooking the Meuse River and the routes to Namur, this fort was built according to the plans of General Henri Alexis Brialmont from 1888 to 1891 and faces the fort of Boncelles. In 1914, it was the site of fierce fighting between the Flémalle resistance and the German invaders who occupied and modified it. Re-armed in the 1930s, the fort still bears many scars from heavy bombardments. During World War II, it was at the Fort de Flémalle that Colonel Modart established the control post of the Liège Fortified Position.

In 1929, after a few years of abandonment, an underground fort was constructed beneath the Brialmont fort, which is why some ventilation towers were placed nearby to supply fresh air to the basements. This ventilation tower has been an artwork since 2014: carved on all sides, each cut represents, according to Lebanese artist Marie Zolamian, a day of waiting per prisoner in the fort.

The modernization of the fort in 1929 was accompanied by the addition of a dome with a 150 mm cannon, a dome with two 105 mm cannons, four clip-on domes with a 75 mm cannon, and a dome with a machine gun.

Regarding the fall of the fort, German General von Richthofen, known as the &quot;Red Baron,&quot; writes in his war book &quot;Stukas! Strohmeyer, Curt. – Berlin: Verl. &quot;Die Heimbücherei&quot;&quot;, he recounts:

It is also the only place in Belgium where a museum room is exclusively dedicated to American female pilots. The museum also displays the daily lives of civilians and, of course, soldiers. The fort is open to the public on the first Saturday of each month. The village of Chokier is a prime example of Liège architectural heritage. The buildings in the center, around the square and the church, in particular, have hardly changed since their construction. Of course, the most famous monument is its castle, followed by its church, but strolling along the Chaussée de Chokier and its buildings is like taking a step back in time.

On the eastern side of the village, you can notice a statue with a unique appearance. This monument is a tribute to Hippolyte Guillery, Chief Engineer of Bridges and Roads, who is said to have doubled the province&#x27;s fortune. He made navigation on the Meuse between Liège and Namur possible year-round by constructing about ten locks. He also redefined the course of the Meuse and removed the islands between the banks at Flémalle. The Châtaigneraie is a manor house built between 1830 and 1840, set in a classified park protected by the Walloon Region, and now houses the Walloon Center for Contemporary Art. The property belongs to the Municipality of Flémalle, which maintains it. The Châtaigneraie has housed this center since 1979, and it was only in 1984 that the Fédération Wallonie-Bruxelles recognized the site for the promotion of contemporary art.

=== Château and Park of the Petite Flémal&#x27; ===

This castle () located on the Grand&#x27; Route has housed municipal services since 1938. It was built in several stages: the right wing was constructed during the 17th century. Then the left wing, dating from the 18th century. Finally, a last wing extending towards the park was built in 1984. The castle is accompanied by a park featuring various garden styles: Italian, French, and an English garden.

=== The Chockier Quarry: Nature Reserve ===
Under the guidance of &quot;Études &amp; Environnement&quot; asbl, efforts to preserve the old Sacré quarries began in 1994. Well-exposed to the sun, these quarries – on the left bank of the Meuse – had developed a very interesting flora and fauna, which were the subject of a nature guide thesis. In 1996, protection of 27 ha was achieved, and a 30-year agreement was signed between the &quot;Natagora&quot; association and the municipality of Flémalle.

=== Caves and Prehistoric Museum ===

The Prehistomuseum of Ramioul is an educational tourism center focused on Prehistory in Belgium.

In its vicinity are several caves that have yielded significant archaeological materials, some of which are displayed at the museum of the prehistoric site.

<text>Dalhem (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium. 

On 1 January 2012 Dalhem had a total population of 6,996. The total area is 36.06 km² which gives a population density of 180 inhabitants per km². The name Dalhem is of Germanic origin and means &quot;place of residence in the valley&quot; (lit. &quot;dale home/dale &quot;).

== Locations in the Municipality ==
The municipality of Dalhem consists of the following districts: Berneau, Bombaye, Dalhem, Feneur, Mortroux, Neufchâteau, Saint-André, and Warsage. The current municipality was formed during the fusion of the Belgian municipalities in 1977. The Château de Wodémont is within the municipality.

== History ==
Already in 1080 a fortress was built in Dalhem on a high rock, where the Berwijn and Bolland rivers merged. Dalhem experienced its first major development since the 12th century, when a few &quot;lords of Voeren&quot; began moving to Dalhem in 1180 and began calling themselves &quot;lords of Dalhem.&quot; Then their goods were transferred to the Count of Hochstaden, making Dalhem a county. The town of Dalhem grew into the administrative center and core of the county of Dalhem, next to &#x27;s-Gravenvoeren (the original Voeren), where the legal power resided. In 1244 it definitively lost its independence and from then on fell indirectly under the Duchy of Brabant.

In 1239, after the duke had defeated the last count of Dalhem, Dirk van Hochstaden, a treaty was concluded in 1244, whereby Dirk van Hochstaden left Dalhem to Brabant for good. From now on a final bailiff or cross-country would take over the reign in the name of the duke. Together with the and Rolduc, Dalhem was henceforth referred to in the official documents as the &#x27;Lands of Overmaas&#x27;. This was sometimes also considered to include Limburg, as a result of which the four lands together received the title &#x27;Province of Limburg&#x27;. Until the dissolution of the county of Dalhem in 1797, the town of Dalhem was furthermore the capital of the county and the capital of one of the Dalhem possession.

In 1648 the Netherlands were divided into a Spanish section and the sovereign Dutch Republic. On 26 December 1661 the castle and town of Dalhem became part of the sovereign part of the County of Dalhem (State Partage) as a result of the (division treaty) between the Dutch Republic and Spain. Economically, the coal mines around Dalhem were of particular importance to the Dutch, while the place itself provided a good military base against the enemy through its castle. In 1665, Robert van Ittersum built the town hall in Dalhem, which today still houses a Nassau coat of arms with the lion above the gate. The town hall itself underwent several renovations over time (1840, 1927).

On 8 November 1785 Austria and the States General signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau, whereby a large part of the county of Dalhem, including the town of Dalhem, was ceded to Austria by the States General in exchange for parts of Austrian Valkenburg. Dalhem thus became part of the Southern Austrian Netherlands. For many residents this was a liberation. After all, Protestantism imposed too high demands on the Catholic population.

Warsage was one of the first villages to be captured in the German invasion of Belgium at the start of World War I in August 1914. Six Belgian civilians were executed by the German Army in reprisals on the first day of the occupation.

Like the rest of the county, insofar as it was located in the Austrian Netherlands, Dalhem was included in the annexation of the Southern Netherlands by the French Republic in 1797 in the newly formed department of Ourthe; which was later transformed into the province of Liège in the time of the United Netherlands.

== Legend ==
According to Nicolas Rémy, in his work &quot;Daemonolatreiae libri tres&quot; the succubus Abrahel appeared in Dalhem in the year 1581.

== Sport ==
Rugby union team Coq Mosan play in the village of Berneau in the municipality.

<doc id="176110" wikidata="Q683034" url="?curid=176110" title="Grâce-Hollogne">
<text>Grâce-Hollogne (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium. The municipality is effectively a part of the greater Liège conurbation, separated from Liège city centre by the municipality of Saint-Nicolas. Included within its boundaries is Liège Airport.

On 1 January 2006 Grâce-Hollogne had a total population of 21,753. The total area is 34.24 km2, which gives a population density of approximately 635 inhabitants per km2.

==Geography==
The municipality consists of the following districts: Bierset, Grâce-Berleur, Hollogne-aux-Pierres, Horion-Hozémont, and Velroux.

== History ==
Grâce-Hollogne was formed by the grouping of former municipalities Bierset, Grâce-Berleur, Hollogne-aux-Pierres, Horion-Hozémont, and Velroux, along with part of Mons-lez-Liège.

The killing of four demonstrators on 30 July 1950 in Grâce-Berleur was one of the most significant moments in the so-called Royal Question of 1950, which grew out of resentment towards King Leopold III and his actions in World War II.

In June 1995 it was from Grâce-Hollogne that Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo were infamously abducted to become victims of the notorious serial killer and child molester Marc Dutroux. One of the municipality&#x27;s schools is now named &quot;École Julie et Melissa&quot; in honour of the murdered girls, and flowers are still left regularly on the Julie &amp; Melissa Monument.

==Economy==
Avient Aviation has its Continental Europe offices on the property of Liège Airport.

<doc id="176111" wikidata="Q211033" url="?curid=176111" title="Herstal">
<text>Herstal (; ), formerly known as Heristal, or Héristal, is a municipality and city of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium. It lies along the Meuse river. Herstal is included in the &quot;Greater Liège&quot; agglomeration, which counts about 600,000 inhabitants.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Herstal, Liers, Milmort, and Vottem.

A large armaments factory, the &quot;Fabrique Nationale&quot; or FN, and the biggest industrial zone of Wallonia (Haut-Sart) provide employment locally.

==History==

===Merovingian and Carolingian golden age===

The name Herstal is of Franconian origin, consisting of the elements &quot;hari&quot; (&quot;army&quot;) and &quot;stal&quot; (&quot;resting place&quot;, &quot;camp&quot;; compare Modern German &quot;Stall&quot;, &quot;stable&quot;). The first mention of Herstal is in Latin documents from ±718 (&quot;Cheristalius&quot; corrected to &quot;Charistalius&quot;) and 723 (&quot;Harastallius&quot;). The first possibly non-Latinized occurrences are &quot;Eristail&quot; (in 919) and &quot;Harstail&quot; (1197).
Pippin of Herstal (ca 635–714), Mayor of the Palace and de facto ruler of Austrasia and Neustria and founder of the family that established the Carolingian dynasty, probably chose this location as his main residence because of its proximity to the major cities of Tongeren, Maastricht, and Liège. Pippin was the father of Charles Martel, victor of the decisive Battle of Tours that stopped the Arab-Muslim advance into northwestern Europe, and great grandfather of Charlemagne, also supposedly born in Herstal. Charlemagne lived for at least fifteen years in Herstal but later established his capital in Aachen, ending Herstal&#x27;s period of medieval glory as capital of the empire.

===Late Middle Ages and modern era===
The town was incorporated into the Duchy of Lower Lotharingia, which became part of the Duchy of Brabant at the end of the 12th century. Despite its proximity to Liège, the territory of Herstal did not become part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège until 1740, when the prince-bishop Georges-Louis de Berghes bought it from Frederick II of Prussia. By that time, the town was mainly known for its able craftsmen: ceramists, blacksmiths, and clockmakers.

In the 19th century, Herstal became a city of coal and steel. It would, however, become world-famous thanks to the foundation of the Fabrique Nationale, a major armament factory, in 1889. Several motorcycle manufacturers also established themselves in town. On August 7, 1914, at the very beginning of World War I, the invading German army executed 27 civilians and destroyed 10 homes in Herstal.
After World War II, heavy industry saw a prolonged period of decline, drastically reducing the number of jobs in these areas. Today, Herstal&#x27;s economy is picking up again, with more than 200 companies established on its territory, including Techspace Aero, which manufactures precision parts for the European Space Agency’s Ariane rocket.

==Politics==

Herstal is a left-wing/socialist stronghold. It was also the strongest area in support of the far-left Workers&#x27; Party of Belgium in the 2019 elections, gaining 27.55% of the votes in Herstal.

== Sites ==
==Notable people==
*Pippin of Herstal, Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy (635 or 640–714)
*Charles Martel, Mayor of the Palace and Duke of the Franks (686–741)
*Charlemagne, king of the Franks and founder of the Holy Roman Empire (742 or 747–814, birth in Herstal is uncertain)
*John Browning, American firearms designer (1855–1926)

<doc id="176117" wikidata="Q194037" url="?curid=176117" title="Seraing">
<text>Seraing (; ) is a municipality and city of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium. 

The municipality consists of the following districts: Boncelles, Jemeppe-sur-Meuse, Ougrée, and Seraing. With Liège, Herstal, Saint-Nicolas, Ans, and Flémalle, it forms the greater Liège agglomeration (600,000 inhabitants). To the south of Seraing are the Condroz and the Ardennes regions.

In addition to its steel factories, Seraing is home to the crystal manufacture Val Saint Lambert, which has been operating on the site of an old Cistercian abbey since 1826. The site of the Arcelor steel company, previously known as Cockerill-Sambre, is the former summer residence for the Prince-Bishopric of Liège.

==History==

===Antiquity and Middle Ages===
Several skeletons, potshards, weapons, and jewels were discovered here, dating from the 5th and 6th century, attesting to Seraing being inhabited in Frankish times. The first mention of &quot;Saran&quot; dates from 956, when a Carolingian farming domain extending on both sides of the river Meuse and owned by someone named Saran was donated to the abbey of Sint-Truiden. The whole territory soon passed to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. In the 11th century, Prince-Bishop Henri I of Verdun used a house in &quot;Seranus&quot; to entertain guests. Throughout the Middle Ages, the inhabitants of Seraing owed allegiance to Liège, pledging to defend the fluvial approach to the city in case of invasion, in exchange for tax exonerations. The first wooden bridge across the river, which replaced the ferry, was built in 1381.

===Industrial development===
The name of the town changed several times throughout its history, with the current spelling only being set in the 18th century. At around that time, various factors combined to attract industrial investors to Seraing: the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the proximity of the river Meuse, and the discovery of coal at Ougrée. The first ironworks were founded there in 1809. John Cockerill and his brother James revolutionized the steel industry by using blast furnaces and coke instead of traditional charcoal. These inventions would be the basis for his new company, John Cockerill &amp; Cie established in Seraing in 1817. Over the next decades, many more metallurgical plants and foundries were built in this area, which became an integral part of Wallonia&#x27;s industrial backbone, the sillon industriel. Glassworkers found the proximity of a cheap source of coal attractive. The Val Saint Lambert started its operations in 1826.

Seraing was the first location in Belgium where the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built in Belgium. Work began on the building in 1927 and completed before the end of 1930.

===Recent developments===
In the 2012 Tour de France, Seraing acted as the finish of Stage 1.

*Besides the Cockerill castle, the historic centre of the city also includes the city hall and the main church, which harbours 12th-century baptismal fonts.
*The forested region south of Seraing offers a multitude of strolls and hikes.

==Folklore==

*Like many other towns in Wallonia, Seraing has its own giant puppet: Li Rayeû d’class.
*Seraing also counts a number of colourful associations, including a coopers’ brotherhood, whose goal is to revive the wineries of the Val Saint Lambert abbey, and the “Gay Boulet” brotherhood, whose mission is to popularize Boulets à la Liégeoise, a local recipe.

<text>Soumagne (, ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium. 

On September 1, 2008, Soumagne had a total population of 15,894. The total area is 27.14 km2 which gives a population density of 585 inhabitants per km2.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Ayeneux, Cerexhe-Heuseux, Évegnée-Tignée, Mélen, Micheroux, and Soumagne.

==History==

From the end of the 19th century until the 1960s, Soumagne was a flourishing municipality with numerous coal mines and a large Cooperative factory.
After the end of coal mining, the mines were cleaned and residences as well as shopping areas were built. Some buildings are kept and transformed into tourism activities (such as &quot;le domaine du Bas-Bois&quot;).

During the German invasion of Belgium at the beginning of World War I, the Imperial German Army killed 118 civilians and burned 100 houses in the village as collective punishment for the Belgian Army’s resistance of the invasion from the nearby Fort de Fléron.

Since 1980, the higher number of people leaving big cities (Liège and Verviers) for more rural municipalities, with the E40 motorway passing on its territory, Soumagne recovered from the loss of coal mining and the end of the Cooperative. In that period, houses are built due to a new, and young, population settling down in Soumagne. A lot of new shops and commercial centers opened and small companies are emerging.

==Attractions==

There are a few touristic points in Soumange (among others):
* the Evegnée fountain (natural fountain in a rural landscape)
* Saint-Lambert church (built during the 13th century, burnt in 1694 and rebuilt)
* &quot;Domaine du Bas-Bois&quot; (a former coal mine site)
* Wégimont Castle (14th century construction changed through the centuries with a park transformed into a family amusement area)

<doc id="176119" wikidata="Q696110" url="?curid=176119" title="Sprimont">
<text>Sprimont (; ) is a municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Dolembreux, Gomzé-Andoumont, Louveigné, Rouvreux, and Sprimont. 

Other villages: Banneux, Damré, Florzé, Lincé, Ogné, Presseux, and Rivage.

On January 1, 2006, Sprimont had a total population of 12,782. The total area is which gives a population density of .

==Etymology==

Sprimont is an ancient name, the earliest written records of which date from 855 and 856 AD. These are located in the Abbey of Stavelot.

The etymology of Sprimont is uncertain. &quot;A priori&quot;, it seems to be the name of a place; however some historians propose that it may derive from a person&#x27;s name.

Spellings of Sprimont may be different, depending on (1) the written language, and (2) the time period. Since Sprimont is more than 1,100 years old, a variety of different spellings are to be expected. For example, Ernst cites &quot;Sprismonte&quot; in 888 AD, and Martine &amp; Duraud cite &quot;Sprismont&quot; in 1049. However, since about 1000 AD &quot;Sprimont&quot; seems to be exclusively used. In (vol. VII), there are further references to the Teutonic and the Frisian , as well as the Latin . These translate as &#x27;speer&#x27;, &#x27;hasta,&#x27; and &#x27;lance.&#x27;

There is a consensus that the root is of a Latin origin. If this is correct, the suffix &quot;-mont&quot; is probably from , meaning either hill or mountain. However, some historians point out that many geographical names with this suffix belong to places not on a hill, some of which are even in valleys. This may cast doubt on the true meaning being &quot;hill&quot;, but another source indicates that was used in Roman times to indicate a way-station for travellers.

As for the prefix of &quot;spri-&quot;, more debate is required, as its origin seems to be lost to antiquity. Ancient written documents indicate several possible Latin origins: . Regardless of the meaning of the root word, one must also consider the usage in the context of the name itself. For example, if it does indeed refer to a species of tree or wood, in those ancient times, what was the connotation? It has been argued persuasively that &#x27;spri&#x27; means &#x27;lance&#x27;.

Concluding the etymology of Sprimont, the active might mean &#x27;Mounted Warrior&#x27;, whereas the passive might mean &#x27;Lance of Defence&#x27;. This is from .

<doc id="176121" wikidata="Q49743" url="?curid=176121" title="Visé">
<text>Visé (; , ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia, located on the river Meuse in the province of Liège, Belgium.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Argenteau, Cheratte, Lanaye, Lixhe, Richelle, and Visé.

In the north-east (on the eastern bank of the Meuse) the area of the municipality extends up to the village of Moelingen in the Limburgian municipality of Voeren, while in the north-west (on the western bank of the Meuse) it extends up to the border between Belgium and the Netherlands (on the other side of which the Dutch municipality of Maastricht is situated).

The city of Visé is located in a distance of some 20 km (12,4 miles) north eastern of Belgian Liège city and of some 15 km (9,3 miles) southern of the most southern Dutch city of Maastricht.

In addition to the Meuse, the Albert Canal also passes through this town.

==History==
The Germans entered Belgium on 4 August 1914, and entered Visé that day as part of the opening movements of the Battle of Liège. A small group of Belgian gendarmes opposed the advancing Germans and two of their number, Auguste Bouko and Jean-Pierre Thill, were killed in the action becoming the first Belgian casualties of World War I. On 7 August, in the Lixhe section of the town, the German 90th Infantry Regiment killed eleven civilians and destroyed eleven houses. By 17 August 1914, forty-two civilians were killed, and 586 out of the village&#x27;s 840 houses had been destroyed.

The Lixhe part of the town was also the site of one of Belgium&#x27;s ninety eastern-frontier advanced-warning posts (&quot;postes d&#x27;alerte de la frontière est&quot;), aimed at preventing a German invasion in 1939 – its number was &quot;PA 0&quot;. The coal mine of Hasard de Cheratte was dug in Cheratte and exploited between 1850 and 1977.

<doc id="176124" wikidata="Q191985" url="?curid=176124" title="Orient Express">
<text>The Orient Express was a long-distance passenger luxury train service created in 1883 by the Belgian company &quot;Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits&quot; (CIWL) that operated until 2009. The train traveled the length of continental Europe, with terminal stations in Paris in the northwest and Istanbul in the southeast, and branches extending service to Athens, Brussels, and London.

The &quot;Orient Express&quot; embarked on its initial journey on June 5, 1883, from Paris to Vienna, eventually extending to Istanbul, thus connecting the western and eastern extremities of Europe. The route saw alterations and expansions, including the introduction of the &quot;Simplon Orient Express&quot; following the opening of the Simplon Tunnel in 1919, enhancing the service&#x27;s allure and importance. Several routes concurrently used the &quot;Orient Express&quot; name, or variations. Although the original &quot;Orient Express&quot; was simply a normal international railway service, the name became synonymous with intrigue and luxury rail travel. The city names most prominently served and associated with the &quot;Orient Express&quot; are Paris and Istanbul, the original termini of the timetabled service. The rolling stock of the &quot;Orient Express&quot; changed many times.

However, post-World War II, the Orient Express struggled to maintain its preeminence amid changing geopolitical landscapes and the rise of air travel. The route stopped serving Istanbul in 1977, cut back to a through overnight service from Paris to Bucharest, which was cut back further in 1991 to Budapest, then in 2001 to Vienna, before departing for the last time from Paris on 8 June 2007. After this, the route, still called the &quot;Orient Express&quot;, was shortened to start from Strasbourg, leaving daily after the arrival of a TGV from Paris. On 14 December 2009, the &quot;Orient Express&quot; ceased to operate entirely and the route disappeared from European railway timetables, a &quot;victim of high-speed trains and cut-rate airlines&quot;.

In contemporary times, the legacy of the &quot;Orient Express&quot; has been revived through private ventures like the &quot;Venice Simplon-Orient-Express&quot;, initiated by James Sherwood in 1982, which offers nostalgic journeys through Europe in restored 1920s and 1930s CIWL carriages, including the original route from Paris to Istanbul. Since December 2021, an ÖBB Nightjet runs three times per week on the Paris-Vienna route, although not branded as &quot;Orient Express.&quot; In late 2026, Accor will launch its own &quot;Orient Express&quot; with journeys from Paris to Istanbul.

== Train Eclair de luxe (the &quot;test&quot; train) ==
In 1882, Georges Nagelmackers, a Belgian banker&#x27;s son, invited guests to a railway trip of on his &quot;Train Eclair de luxe&quot; (&quot;lightning luxury train&quot;). The train left Paris Gare de l&#x27;Est on Tuesday, 10 October 1882, just after 18:30 and arrived in Vienna the next day at 23:20. The return trip left Vienna on Friday, 13 October at 16:40 and, as planned, re-entered the Gare de Strasbourg at 20:00 on Saturday 14 October.

Georges Nagelmackers was the founder of &quot;Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits&quot; (CIWL), which expanded its luxury trains, travel agencies and hotels all over Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its most famous train remains the &quot;Orient Express&quot;.

The train was composed of:
* Baggage car
* Sleeping coach with 16 beds (with bogies)
* Sleeping coach with 14 beds (3 axles)
* Restaurant coach (nr. 107)
* Sleeping coach with 13 beds (3 axles)
* Sleeping coach with 13 beds (3 axles)
* Baggage car (complete 101 ton)
The first menu on board (10 October 1882): oysters, soup with Italian pasta, turbot with green sauce, chicken ‘à la chasseur’, fillet of beef with ‘château’ potatoes, ‘chaud-froid’ of game animals, lettuce, chocolate pudding, buffet of desserts.

== Routes ==

==History==

On 5 June 1883, the first &quot;Express d&#x27;Orient&quot; left Paris for Vienna via Munich. Vienna remained the terminus until 4 October 1883, when the route was extended to Giurgiu, Romania. At Giurgiu, passengers were ferried across the Danube to Ruse, Bulgaria, to pick up another train to Varna. They then completed their journey to Constantinople, as the city was still commonly called in the west at the time, by ferry. In 1885, another route began operations, this time reaching Constantinople via rail from Vienna to Belgrade and Niš, carriage to Plovdiv, and rail again to Istanbul.

On 1 June 1889, the first direct train to Constantinople left Paris from Gare de l&#x27;Est. Istanbul, as it became known in English by the 1930s, remained its easternmost stop until 19 May 1977. The eastern terminus was the Sirkeci Terminal by the Golden Horn. Ferry service from piers next to the terminal would take passengers across the Bosphorus to Haydarpaşa Terminal, the terminus of the Asian lines of the Ottoman Railways.
The train was officially renamed the &quot;Orient Express&quot; in 1891.

The onset of the First World War in 1914 saw &quot;Orient Express&quot; services suspended. They resumed at the end of hostilities in 1918, and in 1919 the opening of the Simplon Tunnel allowed the introduction of a more southerly route via Milan, Venice, and Trieste. The service on this route was known as the &quot;Simplon Orient Express&quot;, and it ran in addition to continuing services on the old route. The Treaty of Saint-Germain contained a clause requiring Austria to accept this train: formerly, Austria allowed international services to pass through Austrian territory (which included Trieste at the time) only if they ran via Vienna. The &quot;Simplon Orient Express&quot; soon became the most important rail route between Paris and Istanbul.
The 1930s saw the &quot;Orient Express&quot; services at its most popular, with three parallel services running: the &quot;Orient Express&quot;, the &quot;Simplon Orient Express&quot;, and also the &quot;Arlberg Orient Express&quot;, which ran via the Arlberg railway between Zürich and Innsbruck to Budapest, with sleeper cars running onwards from there to Bucharest and Athens. During this time, the &quot;Orient Express&quot; acquired its reputation for comfort and luxury, carrying sleeping cars with permanent service and restaurant cars known for the quality of their cuisine. Royalty, nobles, diplomats, business people, and the bourgeoisie in general patronized it. Each of the &quot;Orient Express&quot; services also incorporated sleeping cars which had run from Calais to Paris, thus extending the service from one end of continental Europe to the other.

The start of the Second World War in 1939 again interrupted the service, which did not resume until 1945. During the war, the German Mitropa company had run some services on the route through the Balkans, but Yugoslav Partisans frequently sabotaged the track, forcing a stop to this service.

Following the end of the war, normal services resumed except on the Athens leg, where the closure of the border between Yugoslavia and Greece prevented services from running. That border re-opened in 1951, but the closure of the Bulgarian–Turkish border from 1951 to 1952 prevented services running to Istanbul during that time. As the Iron Curtain fell across Europe, the service continued to run, but the Communist nations increasingly replaced the &quot;Wagon-Lits&quot; cars with carriages run by their own railway services.

By 1962, the original &quot;Orient Express&quot; and &quot;Arlberg Orient Express&quot; had stopped running, leaving only the &quot;Simplon Orient Express&quot;. This was replaced in 1962 by a slower service called the &quot;Direct Orient Express&quot;, which ran daily cars from Paris to Belgrade, and twice weekly services from Paris to Istanbul and Athens.
In 1971, the &quot;Wagon-Lits&quot; company stopped running carriages itself and making revenues from a ticket supplement. Instead, it sold or leased all its carriages to the various national railway companies, but continued to provide staff for the carriages. 1976 saw the withdrawal of the Paris–Athens direct service, and in 1977, the &quot;Direct Orient Express&quot; was withdrawn completely, with the last Paris–Istanbul service running on 19 May of that year.
The withdrawal of the &quot;Direct Orient Express&quot; was thought by many to signal the end of the &quot;Orient Express&quot; as a whole, but in fact a service under this name continued to run from Paris to Bucharest as before (via Strasbourg, Munich, Vienna, and Budapest). However, a through sleeping car from Paris to Bucharest was only operated until 1982, and also a through seating car was only operated seasonally. This meant that, as Paris–Budapest and Vienna–Bucharest coaches were running overlapped, a journey was only possible with changing carriages – despite the unchanged name and numbering of the train. In 1991 the Budapest-Bucharest leg of the train was discontinued, the new final station now becoming Budapest. In the summer season of 1999 and 2000 a sleeping car from Bucharest to Paris reappeared running twice a week, now operated by CFR. This continued until 2001, when the service was cut back to just Paris–Vienna, as a EuroNight train, though the coaches were actually attached to a regular Paris–Strasbourg express for that leg of the journey. This service continued daily, listed in the timetables under the name &quot;Orient Express&quot;, until 8 June 2007.

With the opening of the LGV Est Paris–Strasbourg high speed rail line on 10 June 2007, the &quot;Orient Express&quot; service was further cut back to Strasbourg–Vienna, departing nightly at 22:20 from Strasbourg, and still bearing the name, but lost the train numbers 262/263 which it had borne for decades.

The remains of the original train had a convenient connection to the Strasbourg-Paris TGV, but due to the less flexible prices the route became less attractive. In the final years through coaches between Vienna and Karlsruhe (continuing first to Dortmund, then to Amsterdam, and finally to Frankfurt) were attached. The last train with the name &quot;Orient-Express&quot; (now with a hyphen) departed from Vienna on 10 December 2009, and one day later from Strasbourg.

On 13 December 2021, an ÖBB Nightjet train began running three times per week on the Paris-Vienna route, although it is not branded as &quot;Orient Express.&quot;

One of the last known CIWL teak sleeping cars from the period before the First World War can be seen at the former Amfikleia station site in Greece.

== Privately run trains using the name ==
In 1976, the Swiss travel company &quot;Intraflug AG&quot; first rented, then later bought several CIWL-carriages. They were operated as the &quot;Nostalgic Istanbul Orient Express&quot; by Seattle-based Society Expeditions. The route went first from Zürich to Istanbul, following the route of the &quot;Arlberg Orient Express&quot;. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the &quot;Orient Express&quot; was celebrated by extending the route to run from Paris to Istanbul. The train ceased operations in 2007.

===Belmond===

In 1982, the &quot;Venice Simplon-Orient-Express&quot; was established by businessman James Sherwood as a private venture and is currently owned and operated by Belmond. It operates restored 1920s and 1930s carriages on routes around Europe. It also offered a connecting service from London to Folkestone on the &quot;British Pullman&quot;, using similarly restored vintage British Pullman cars, but it was announced in April 2023 that due to complications ensuing from Brexit this would cease, and travelers from London would have to take Eurostar to Paris in order to join the Orient Express. The Venice Simplon-Orient-Express operates from March to December and is aimed at leisure travellers. Tickets start at US$3,262 per person and it operates on multiple different routes most notably Paris-Istanbul via Vienna and Budapest. Despite its name, the train runs via the Brenner Pass instead of the Simplon tunnel. Belmond also offers a similarly themed luxury train in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, called the &quot;Eastern and Oriental Express&quot;. Sherwood also operated a chain of Orient Express-branded luxury hotels, licensed from SNCF, owner of the Orient Express branding. The chain was renamed Belmond in 2014 when the branding license ended.

===Accor===

In 2017, Accor purchased a 50% stake in the Orient Express brand from SNCF for the right to use the name. In 2018, Accor began renovation work on 17 CIWL carriages from the defunct &quot;Nostalgie Istanbul Orient Express&quot;, which date back to the 1920s and 1930s. It will carry passengers between Paris and Istanbul beginning in late 2026.

== In popular culture ==
The glamour and rich history of the &quot;Orient Express&quot; has frequently lent itself to the plot of books and films and as the subject of television documentaries.

<doc id="176131" wikidata="Q1896959" url="?curid=176131" title="Nord Express">
<text>The Nord Express (Northern Express) was a long-distance international express train which for more than a century connected Paris with first Russia and later Poland, the Baltic states and Scandinavia. In its heyday before the First World War, it was considered the ultimate luxury train in Europe.

Introduced in 1896 by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which operated sleeping-cars, dining cars and trains deluxe all over Europe, including the Orient Express, it connected Paris and Saint Petersburg. After World War I and the Russian Revolution, the train&#x27;s route was shortened to Warsaw and Riga instead of Saint Petersburg. And after World War II the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; diverted the train&#x27;s route further to Stockholm and Oslo, until air travel caused the end to this famous train.

Although the Nord Express has received significantly less attention than the Orient Express, it is one of the CIWL&#x27;s best-known luxury trains and has been featured in a number of artistic works.

== History ==
=== Background ===

In 1874, the Belgian civil engineer and railway entrepreneur Georges Nagelmackers founded the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (lit. &quot;International Sleeping-Car Company&quot;, also &quot;CIWL&quot;). The purpose was to establish a network of luxurious long-distance passenger trains across the European continent inspired by the Pullman night trains of the United States. As one of these train connections, the CIWL wanted to establish a direct cross-continental link between Saint Petersburg and Lisbon to connect with ocean liners to America. However, this concept proved too complex and could not be realized. In turn, two separate connections arose: the &quot;Sud Express&quot; from Paris to Lisbon and the &quot;Nord Express&quot; from Paris to Saint Petersburg.

=== Before World War I ===

On 9 May 1896, the Nord Express departed for the first time from the French to the Russian capital. This train service enabled people to travel across Europe in what was, by the standards of the time, a very fast and comfortable manner. For the operation of the Nord Express, the CIWL had to close contracts and timetable agreements with fourteen railway administrations, including nine Prussian administrations, as well as the ferry service across the English Channel between Dover and Ostend.

The train left Paris and Ostend (with connection from London) and travelled via Brussels, Cologne, Hanover, Berlin, Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) and Dvinsk (now Daugavpils) to Saint Petersburg. Passengers to and from Russia had to change once in East Prussia at the German/Russian border because Russian railway tracks are of a wider gauge than those in Western Europe. In Paris there was a connecting service to the &quot;Sud Express&quot; (Southern Express) to Lisbon.

=== Interwar period ===

After World War I and the Russian Revolution the train&#x27;s route was shortened to Warsaw and Riga instead of Saint Petersburg. Riga joined the connection in 1923, with a separate Riga–Moscow line introduced as well.

=== Post-War Period ===

After World War II the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; divided Europe, and the initially luxury and since 1951 ordinary night train&#x27;s route was diverted further from Paris via Hamburg and Copenhagen to Stockholm and Oslo. 

The emergence of air travel and high-speed rail caused the end to this famous train. In 2007 it was shortened further and such that it ran between Paris and Hamburg, taking 10.5 hours.

==In the arts==
The Nord Express has received significantly less attention than the Orient Express. Nevertheless, it is one of the CIWL&#x27;s best-known luxury trains and has been featured in a number of novels and films:
*Georges Simenon&#x27;s detective novel &quot;The Strange Case of Peter the Lett&quot; (1931) starts with the arrival of the &quot;Nord Express&quot; at the Gare du Nord in Paris. It is the first novel to feature Inspector Jules Maigret who would later appear in more than a hundred stories by Simenon and who has become a legendary figure in the annals of detective fiction.
*Vladimir Nabokov describes in the seventh chapter of &quot;Speak, Memory&quot; how he traveled on the &quot;Nord Express&quot; from Saint Petersburg to France for a holiday in 1906.
*Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s movie &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), was translated to French as &quot;L&#x27;inconnu du Nord-Express&quot; (The unknown man in the Nord-Express).
*The animated 20th Century Fox movie, &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997) mentioned that the train was traveling from Saint Petersburg to Paris, which was most likely referring to the Nord Express.
*The final conflict of &quot;The Silver Skates&quot; revolves around gaining passage to Paris on the Nord Express.

<doc id="176135" wikidata="Q151831" url="?curid=176135" title="Eupen">
<text>Eupen (, , ; ; ; former ) is the capital of German-speaking Community of Belgium and is a city and municipality in the Belgian province of Liège, from the German border (Aachen), from the Dutch border (Maastricht) and from the &quot;High Fens&quot; nature reserve (Ardennes). The town is also the capital of the Euroregion Meuse-Rhine.

First mentioned in 1213 as belonging to the Duchy of Limburg, possession of Eupen passed to Brabant, Burgundy, the Holy Roman Empire and France before being given in 1815 to Prussia, which became part of the new German Empire in 1871. In 1919, after the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles transferred Eupen and the nearby municipality of Malmedy from Germany to Belgium.

German remains the official language in Eupen (also spoken in the form of the Eupen dialect), and the city serves as the capital for Belgium&#x27;s German-speaking Community. The city has a small university, the &quot;&quot;, offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Education and Nursing. In 2010, Eupen&#x27;s association football team, K.A.S. Eupen, became the first club from the German-speaking Community to play in the Belgian Pro League.

On 1 January 2006, Eupen had a total population of 18,248 (8,892 males and 9,356 females). The total area is which gives a population density of 175.90 inhabitants per km2.

==History==
===Early history===
Eupen and the St. Nikolaus Chapel were first mentioned in 1213 as part of the Duchy of Limburg. In 1288, after the Battle of Worringen, the Duchy of Limburg was annexed by John I of Brabant. Brabant and Limburg were inherited by Burgundy in 1387, and Eupen was burnt to the ground during the war against the Guelders. Burgundy was dissolved in 1477 by the Austrian Habsburgs who then inherited Eupen after gaining both Limburg and Brabant.

===Habsburgs and Germans===
Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Charles V granted Eupen the privilege to conduct two markets per year in 1544. In 1555, both Brabant and Limburg were passed to the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs. Ten years later, Protestantism was mentioned for the first time in the town. In 1582, during the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish Habsburgs, rebels burnt Eupen but did not take control of it. Bubonic plague reached Eupen in 1635, with devastating consequences. Eupen obtained its own court of law in 1648, and in 1674 received city rights, giving it greater recognition and autonomy. Six years later, textile manufacture was introduced to the city.

In 1713, with the Treaty of Utrecht, Brabant and Limburg were returned to the Austrian Habsburgs. Revolutionary France took the city in 1794, incorporating it into the &quot;Département&quot; Ourthe, Liège and Malmedy. Following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Eupen became part of the Prussian Rhine Province. All Prussian possessions became part of the German Empire in 1871, while Eupen itself enjoyed its popularity as a spa town.

Records show that a weaver named &#x27;Schunck&#x27; was established as early as 1776. His eldest son, Nikolaus Severin Schunck (1799–1865), had six sons, of whom the third oldest, Arnold, would later found the firm in Heerlen. The youngest son, Joseph, remained at the weaving mill and there is still a weaving mill in Kettenis run by descendants of Nikolaus. The company became the famous Schunck.

===20th century===
After the First World War, the 1919 Treaty of Versailles transferred Eupen and the nearby municipality of Malmedy from Germany to Belgium. The effect led to the formation of National Socialist groups in Eupen. From 1938 the Vesdre Dam was constructed (completed in 1950), creating Lake Eupen. In 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium; in an attempt to reverse Versailles, Eupen and Malmedy were annexed to Germany. In September 1944, American forces reached Eupen which became a centre of fierce fighting in the Battle of the Bulge.

In 1949, the left tower of the St Nikolaus Church burnt down. The city centre was affected by flooding in 1953. Eupen merged with the municipality of Kettenis in 1976, amidst protest from that town.

In 1980, following a state reform ten years earlier, the German-Speaking Community of Belgium was established and Eupen was named as its capital.

==Climate==
Eupen has a cool oceanic climate with some continental influences due to it being elevated in comparison to most of Belgium. Eupen is also wetter and cloudier than Liège in the valley to the west, as a result of orographic lift due to the elevation change. As a result of this along with frequent winter frosts, Eupen gets a significant snowfall amount by Belgian standards. It also gets 16 ice days on average each year, as in the day staying below , along with 71 frost days.

== Culture ==

* Municipal Museum, Gospertstrasse
* IKOB: Museum of Contemporary Art
* Permanent exhibition of paintings at the Christian Silvain Foundation
* BRF: Belgischer Rundfunk, is the public-service broadcasting organisation serving the German-speaking Community of Belgium.

== Sport ==

K.A.S. Eupen, founded in 1945, is the city&#x27;s main association football club and play at the 8,000-capacity Kehrwegstadion. In 2010, after winning a play-off, the side became the first club from the German-speaking Community to reach the country&#x27;s top flight, then known as the Belgian Pro League. They were relegated after one season, returning to the top level, now known as Belgian First Division A, in 2016.

<text>Kelmis (; , ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Liège, named for the historical deposits of calamine (zinc ore) nearby. , the population was 10,881; the area is , and the population density is .

The municipality comprises the following sub-municipalities: Kelmis proper, Hergenrath, and Neu-Moresnet.

The territory around the Vieille Montagne zinc mine in Kelmis was Neutral Moresnet, a neutral condominium of the Netherlands and Prussia (later Belgium and Germany) from 1816 to 1919, with the Mayor of Kelmis nominated by two commissioners from the neighbouring countries. Although there were attempts by locals to make it evolve into a fully independent microstate, all of them were thwarted, and it remained under double sovereignty and neutrality until its eventual annexation by Belgium after the First World War.

There is a war memorial to German soldiers from Kelmis who were killed during the Franco-Prussian War, located in the Aachener Strasse, and one to inhabitants of Kelmis who were killed in the First and Second World Wars, located in the Kirchplatz (French: &quot;Place de l&#x27;Église&quot;).

A small museum in Kelmis, the &quot;Museum Vieille Montagne&quot;, includes exhibits on Neutral Moresnet. Of the 60 border markers for the territory, more than 50 are still standing.

In the nineteenth century, a Low Dietsch dialect was spoken in Kelmis. Today, Kelmis is German-speaking. It has facilities for French speakers, and is one of the nine municipalities of the German‑speaking Community of Belgium.

<text>Limbourg (; German and Dutch: &quot;Limburg&quot;; ) or Limbourg-sur-Vesdre is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium.

On 1 January 2008, Limbourg had a total population of 5,680. The total area is 24.63 km2 which gives a population density of 231 inhabitants per km2. 

The municipality consists of the following districts: Bilstain, Goé, and Limbourg.

The lower part of the town, along the Vesdre, is called Dolhain.

== Etymology and history ==

The second part of the name Limbourg is from &quot;burg&quot; meaning a fortified town, which is common in many parts of Europe where Germanic languages are spoken or have been spoken historically (see Germanic placename etymology). Concerning the first part of the name, there are various theories. One is &quot;lint&quot; meaning &quot;dragon&quot;. Another is that it refers back to the Roman-era limes, situated at boundaries of the Empire. It may also have been related to the material &quot;lim&quot; or lime. Jean-Louis Kupper has proposed that the fort was named by its founder Frederick after Limburg Abbey in Germany, which in his lifetime had important connection to his imperial patrons and the Abbey of Stavelot, for which he was advowee.

Limbourg is located on top of a hill which in its turn is surrounded by the river Vesdre. This was a strong military advantage in the Middle Ages and allowed the city to defend itself against foreign invaders. In the Middle Ages, the ruling family came to have the rank of duke and so the town was the seat of the Duchy of Limburg, which was a part of the Lower Lorraine region of the Holy Roman Empire.

The town featured in the War of the Spanish Succession, falling in 1703 to British and Dutch Republican forces led by the Duke of Marlborough. 

The song &#x27;The Fat Lady of Limbourg&#x27; on Brian Eno&#x27;s 1974 album &#x27;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&#x27; describes an asylum in the town which has more patients than there are residents of the town.

Malmedy and Waimes are the two municipalities in the French-speaking part of Wallonia with facilities for German speakers. The population of Malmedy is approximately 95% French speakers and 5% German speakers. The variety of German spoken is Moselle Franconian.

== Geology ==
=== Seismic risks ===
In the provinces of Liège, Limburg and Hainaut, seismic activity is higher than in the rest of the country. Malmedy is one of the communes in zone 2, that is to say, the zone most susceptible to earthquakes, in Belgium.

The earthquake of 1692, which touched the area of Verviers, as well as being responsible for landslides, took place in the valley of Warche east of Bévercé (in the south of the junction with the brook of &quot;Trô Maret&quot;). The remains and evidence, of these landslides, which affected the Conglomerate of Malmedy were discovered in March 2015. Ground surveys, subsequently, led to revisions of the local geological map. 

== History ==

The name of &quot;Malmedy&quot; comes from the Latin sentence &quot;A malo mundarum&quot;, meaning &quot;purifying from evil&quot;. The name originated due to regular flooding in the past from the Warche river, which passes through the town.

The city was founded in 648 by Saint Remacle, Abbot of Solignac Abbey in France. He had established his Benedictine Monastery in Malmedy. Between this date and 1794, the history of Malmedy is linked to the Princely Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy, a clerical microstate ruled by a prince-abbot.

For 1,146 years, Malmedy and Stavelot together formed the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy. Seventy-seven successive prince abbots of the Germanic Holy Roman Empire and the County of Logne led the state. However, a rivalry grew up rapidly between the two towns, because Saint Remacle decided to choose Stavelot as the main city of the Principality.

In the 16th century, a significant number of industries appeared in the area of Malmedy: cloth, leather and gunpowder production. In the 17th century, Stavelot-Malmedy became the most important tannery centre in Europe. But the main industry in Malmedy was the papermaking industry. It brought considerable wealth to the town.

In 1795, during the French Revolution and the Liège Revolution, the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy was annexed by France. Malmedy became a lower prefecture in the &quot;département de l&#x27;Ourthe&quot;.

After the defeat of Napoléon in 1815, during the Congress of Vienna, the decision was made to link Malmedy, a Romance and Walloon town, to Prussia, a Germanic state. This special situation of Malmedy caused a lot of problems in the first 50 years. However, the inhabitants were free to speak French as they pleased, including in the day-to-day running of the town council.

This situation changed following the Franco-German War of 1870 and the foundation of the German Empire. For the Prussian-German administration, Malmedy suffered a double disadvantage as it was both francophone and Catholic. From this moment, the government under Chancellor Bismarck implemented a policy of Germanisation: In schools, lessons in French were banned and the German language was mandatory. The priests were not allowed to preach any longer in French.

During the First World War, the population of Malmedy fought in German uniforms. But when the defeat of the German Empire was proclaimed, Malmedy and the other eastern cantons were annexed to Belgium by virtue of the Treaty of Versailles. Malmedy and neighbouring Eupen were subject to a plebiscite to determine whether the region would be separated from Germany and annexed to Belgium. The plebiscite ballots required registration of the names and addresses of the pro-German voters (the others were assumed to be pro-Belgian), and the German-speaking population of Eupen and Malmedy were intimidated. Both were formally annexed on 6 March 1925.

The main church of Malmedy that was built in 1777 served as a cathedral from 1920 to 1925. 

Some older sources spell the city&#x27;s name &quot;Malmédy&quot; - the accent was added when being part of Prussia and Germany - but its official website lists it as &quot;Malmedy&quot;, with no accent. Along with the neighbouring city of Eupen, it formed a German-speaking area of Belgium. During this period, a few undaunted individuals went as far as founding a &quot;Walloon Club&quot; in 1897, and this still exists today.

Between 1940 and 1945, Malmedy was re-incorporated into Germany. In 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge, the area was the site of the Malmedy massacre, where 84 American prisoners of war were killed by Nazi SS troops under the command of Joachim Peiper. This was one of a number of such massacres of prisoners and Belgian civilians which took place in the Malmedy area.

On 21 December 1944 the town, which was then held by US troops, was attacked by German forces (under the command of Otto Skorzeny), who were repelled. On 23, 24 and 25 December 1944 the city was bombed repeatedly by the United States Army Air Forces in a series of friendly fire incidents. Approximately 200 civilians were killed in the attacks, while the number of American casualties has never been revealed by the United States Department of Defense.

Today, the people of Malmedy are a mix of Romance and German cultures. Despite all the changes, the Malmedians seem to have preserved the qualities recognised by an 18th-century English chemist when he stated, &quot;The inhabitants of Malmedy are honest, skillful, opulent, gracious, sociable and courteous towards foreigners.&quot;

Nowadays, the population consists of approximately 12,000 inhabitants. There are seven male choirs, two song groups, four brass bands, an accordion club, a mandolin club and a very active music academy.

== Languages ==
Malmedy is a predominantly French-speaking city, with almost all of its population having French as their mother tongue.

However, due to its geographical position and history, Malmedy attaches great importance to the German language; although few, some people have German as their mother tongue.

Walloon is the historical language of the city, however few people speak it today and it is in constant decline against French. Most of the time, they are elderly people who have mastered this language. But Walloon remains present in the folk songs of the &quot;Cwarmê&quot; (Carnival).

== Climate ==
Malmedy has an oceanic climate with continental influences due to its inland position and higher elevation. Winter can see ice days, strong air frosts and snowfall. Malmedy&#x27;s high precipitation is commonly affecting the nearby Spa-Francorchamps race track, known for its treacherous weather conditions.

== Folklore ==

Inhabitants are proud of their Walloon language and their typical folklore. The people of Malmedy never miss the chance to celebrate a festival. The main celebrations in Malmedy are the &quot; (Carnival), the &quot; (Midsummer&#x27;s Day), the &quot; (the annual funfair at Saint Peter&#x27;s Day), the &quot; (in Walloon &quot;) and the Saint Martin&#x27;s day (&quot;).

=== Cwarmê ===

The &quot;, a Walloon word defining the Carnival of Malmedy, is the town&#x27;s main festivity. Even though a part of the Malmedian culture is linked to the German culture, the &quot; of Malmedy is actually a Walloon and Latin carnival.

The celebration takes place from Shrove Friday to Shrove Tuesday, 40 days before Easter. The &quot; Sunday is the most important day. For the tourist, it&#x27;s the opportunity to see the old traditional costumes in the streets (2,500 people in costume). The &quot; is depicted as a &quot;street carnival&quot; and is not only a parade: people who are disguised pass through the crowd and perform amongst them.

Some traditional costumes at the &quot; of Malmedy[52]:
** The &quot; is the most beautiful and most famous traditional costume of the &quot;. She has a great hat with multi-coloured feathers and uses a form of long wooden tongs to catch the foot of a spectator.
** The &quot; (Long-bras in French, Long-arms in English) is a type of clown with long arms. He uses his arms to catch a spectator&#x27;s hat which he then puts on the head of another person.
** The &quot;&quot; consists of a group of eight people, each wearing a long-nose mask, a traditional blue smock and a long red &amp; white cap. The group chooses a spectator in the crowd whom they follow and imitate until he offers them some beverages.

<text>St. Vith ( ; ; ; ) is a city and municipality of East Belgium located in the Walloon province of Liège. It was named after Saint Vitus. The majority language is German, as in the rest of the German-speaking Community of Belgium. 

On January 1, 2006, St. Vith had a total population of 9,169. The total area is 146.93 km2, giving a population density of 62 inhabitants per km2. The official language of the municipality is German.

The municipality consists of the following sub-municipalities: Sankt Vith, Crombach, Lommersweiler, Recht, and Schönberg.

==History==
St. Vith was an important marketplace of the region by the 12th century and received town rights in 1350. The town was damaged by fires in 1543, 1602, and 1689. It was part of the Duchy of Luxemburg then of France until the defeat of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. As a result of the Congress of Vienna it was given to the Kingdom of Prussia.

St. Vith was transferred to Belgium on March 6, 1925, by the Treaty of Versailles after the defeat of the German Empire in World War I.
An important road and railway junction, St. Vith was fought over in the 1944 Battle of the Bulge during World War II. The United States Army defended the town against German assault for a few days, delaying the German attack plan, before eventually being forced to retreat. Once it was captured by German forces, the town was bombed by the US Army Air Forces on 25 and 26 December 1944 and by RAF Bomber Command with 300 aircraft on the 26. St. Vith was mostly destroyed during the ground battle and subsequent air attack. American forces retook the town on January 23, 1945. The only pre-war architecture remaining is the .

St. Vith is the setting for Michael Oren&#x27;s novel, &quot;Reunion&quot;, concerning a fictional reunion of an American battalion which participated in the Battle of the Bulge.

<text>Spa (; ) is a municipality and city of Wallonia in the province of Liège, Belgium, whose name became an eponym for mineral baths with supposed curative properties. It is in a valley in the Ardennes mountains south-east of Liège and south-west of Aachen. In 2006, Spa had a population of 10,543 and an area of , giving a population density of .

Spa is one of Belgium&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations, being renowned for its natural mineral springs, and production of &quot;Spa&quot; mineral water, which is exported worldwide. The motor-racing Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, just south of the nearby village of Francorchamps, also hosts the annual Formula One Belgian Grand Prix and various endurance races such as the 24 Hours of Spa. The world&#x27;s first beauty pageant, the Concours de Beauté, was held in Spa on 19 September 1888. The town also hosted the Tour de France on 5 July 2010, when stage 2 of the race ended there.

In 2021, Spa became part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site the Great Spa Towns of Europe, for its famous mineral springs and architectural testimony to the rise of European bathing culture in the 18th and 19th centuries.

==Toponymy==
Among the various hypotheses put forward as to the etymological origin of the name &quot;Spa&quot; is that of &quot;gushing spring&quot;, from the Latin &quot;sparsa&quot; meaning &quot;scattered&quot; and &quot;gushing&quot;, past participle of &quot;spargere&quot; (&quot;scatter&quot;, &quot;sprinkle&quot; or &quot;moisten&quot;). Another connects the word to the meaning of &quot;free space&quot;, from the Walloon &quot;spâ&quot; and from the Latin &quot;spatia&quot;, plural of &quot;spatium&quot;.

The place has been known since Roman times, when the location was called &quot;Aquae Spadanae&quot;. For this reason, the city&#x27;s name is sometimes presented as the acronym of various Latin phrases, such as &quot;salus per aquam&quot; or &quot;sanitas per aquam&quot;, meaning &quot;health through water&quot;; it is in reality a backronym, an a posteriori fabrication of a fictitious acronym.

The term &quot;Spa&quot; has since become eponymous with any place having a natural water source that is believed to possess special health-giving properties, known as a &quot;spa&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-20th century===
As the site of cold springs with alleged healing properties, Spa has been frequented as a &quot;water-taking&quot; place since classical antiquity. Pliny the Elder (died 79 CE) noted, &quot;There is a famous spring in Tungri, a state of Gaul, whose water, sparkling with bubbles, has a ferruginous taste that is only noticeable when the drink is finished. This water purges the body, cures third-grade fevers and dispels calculous affections. The same water, put on the fire, becomes cloudy and eventually turns red.&quot; (C lib. XXXI VIII)

The spa town grew in the Middle Ages, in the oldest iron and steel centre of Liège Province. The &quot;ban Spa&quot; was created around 1335 and included two urban concentrations: &quot;vilhe of Creppe&quot; and &quot;vilhe&quot; Spas, away. Prior to the exploitation of mineral water, the steel industry developed communication lines, which made it possible to develop the spa town.

As early as 1547, Agustino, physician to the King of England, Henry VIII, stayed in Spa and helped give knowledge to the world of the value of the Spa water. In 1559, Gilbert Lymborh wrote of &quot;acid fountains of the Ardennes forest and primarily those located in Spa&quot;. It was translated into Latin, Italian and Spanish. In July 1565, the gentry of the provinces met in Spa under the pretext of taking the waters. At the hotel &quot;Aux Armes d’Angleterre&quot;, those present agreed to oppose the edicts of Philip II as austere and intolerant; this led to the historic 1566 &quot;Compromise of Nobles&quot;. In 1654, the stay of the exiled pretender to the English throne, Prince Charles, brought even greater fame to Spa. From 1699, a postal system was set up between Spa and the outside world.

Since the 18th century, casinos have been located in Spa. The town continued to grow as a fashionable resort in the 19th century, and was extended during the reign of King Leopold II. Buildings such as the Thermal Baths (1868), the Pouhon Peter the Great (1880), and the Leopold II Gallery (1880) date from this period.

===20th century===
During World War I, Spa operated as an important German convalescent hospital town between 1914 and 1917. In 1918, the German Army established its principal headquarters in Spa, and from there the delegates set out for the French lines to meet Marshal Foch and to sue for peace in the consultations leading up to the Armistice that ended the First World War. The general headquarters of Kaiser Wilhelm II were, in 1918, the last place where he resided before his abdication due to the German surrender. In July 1920, the town hosted the Spa Conference, a meeting of the Supreme Council, which dealt with the war reparations owed by the defeated Reich to the Allies.

The Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps was established in 1921, in the vicinity of Spa. Despite its name, the racetrack has never been located within Spa: it is instead in the nearby town of Stavelot.

World War II saw Spa reoccupied by the Germans, but the town escaped the Battle of the Bulge in 1945 that stopped, luckily for Spa, right at its gates. The Marshall Plan helped Belgium to recover quickly. In the 1950s and 1960s, mass tourism gradually developed, diminishing Spa&#x27;s reliance on the elite as customers. These were decades of social tourism as well, with an increasingly large number of Flemish and Dutch customers, while the Walloons went &quot;en masse&quot; to the Belgian coast in Flanders. Relaxation tourism replaced the thermal aspect of Spa.

The 1980s and 1990s heralded the start of a renewal of the infrastructure and influence of Spa. On 17 May 1983, to mark the 400th anniversary of the export of Spa waters, HM King Baudouin visited the new facilities of the Spa Monopole SA, the Henrijean Hydrology Institute and the Thermal Establishment. In 1994, a new French song festival started: &quot;Les Francofolies de Spa&quot;. In 1997, the area of Spa-Bérinzenne opened the Regional Center for Initiation to the Environment, one of whose specialties is water.

===21st century===
The old Thermal Baths were closed in 2004. In 2005, a new thermal center, Thermoludism, opened on the Annette and Lubin hill with panoramic views of the city. It is directly linked by funicular to the heart of the city and a new luxury hotel.

In 2007, the Spa-Francorchamps circuit completely renewed its infrastructure to comply with the best international standards, allowing it to continue to host the annual Belgian Formula One Grand Prix 1, in addition to many other annual sporting events.

==Geography and geology==
Spa is located on the borders of the Ardennes massif, at the gateway to the High Fens in the Wayai valley. The city center is surrounded by three wooded hills including Annette and Lubin to the north. The town borders the rural municipalities of Theux, Jalhay, Stavelot and Stoumont in the district of Verviers in the province of Liège. The municipal area is ; including of built and related land, of agricultural land and of forests and wooded land.

Many of the famous mineral springs in Spa are located on a hillside south of the town. In total, there are more than 300 cold mineral springs in Spa and its surroundings, classified into two types: light mineral waters and natural sparkling waters (called &#x27;pouhons&#x27; locally). The light mineral waters come from recent rainfall on the Malchamps Moor, roughly south-west of the town and are filtered through layers of peat, quartz, and phyllite. In contrast, the pouhon waters come from rainfall that may be decades old, having percolated through calcareous rocks hundreds of meters underground.

==Climate==
Spa has an oceanic climate that is made more continental by its higher elevation and inland position compared to other Belgian climates at lower level or closer to the sea. Spa has a relatively high precipitation year-round, with tricky weather something that the Spa-Francorchamps race track is known for. The elevation also results in cooler summers and frequent winter frost along with snowfall. Spa is quite gloomy, although averaging both a drier and sunnier climate than nearby locations Stavelot and Malmedy that are also surrounding the race track.

==Transport==
Spa has two railway stations: &quot;Spa&quot; and &quot;Spa-Géronstère&quot;, where local trains of SNCB/NMBS link the city with Theux, Verviers and Aachen. The railway line used to extend further south towards Trois-Ponts, Vielsalm and Luxembourg. Local and regional bus services in Spa are provided by the Walloon transport company TEC. Spa is located on the crosspoint of national roads N62, N629 and N686. The nearest motorway is the A27 (E42), where a junction for Spa is located in the commune of Jalhay.

==Heraldry==
The coat of arms for Spa is a stylized pouhon housed in a neoclassical monument to the covering surrounded by a protective wall opened its facade. The monument is topped by a blue banner bearing the &quot;Spa-Pouhon&quot; inscriptions. &quot;Argent masonry money pouhon of sand topped with gold-SPA Pouhon inscriptions on a blue background.&quot; The city colours are yellow and blue. The stylized pouhon is inspired by the monument that housed the Pouhon Peter the Great until 1820.

Under the Ancien Régime, the shield was commonly used in spa towns. It was customary for the spa guests to leave their arms at the hotel where he had stayed in recognition of the benefits of the waters. At Spa, many hotels have inscriptions like &quot;In the Arms of England&quot;, &quot;the Duke of Orleans,&quot; &quot;To the King of Poland&quot;, etc.

<text>Stavelot (; ; ) is a town and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium. 

The municipality consists of the following districts: Francorchamps and Stavelot.

It is best known as the home of Spa-Francorchamps Circuit and the Laetare de Stavelot carnival.

==Population==
In 2006, Stavelot had a population of 6,671 and an area of , giving a population density of .

==History==
The town grew up around the Abbey of Stavelot, founded &quot;ca&quot; 650, out of what had been a villa, by Saint Remaclus (Saint Remacle). The villa&#x27;s lands occupied the borderland between the bishoprics of Cologne and Tongeren. The Abbey of Stavelot was secularized and demolished at the time of the French Revolution: of the church just the west end doorway remains, as a free-standing tower. Two cloisters — one secular, one for the monks — survive as the courtyards of the brick-and-stone 17th-century domestic ranges, now housing the Museum of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy, and museums devoted to the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who was a long-term resident, and to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. The foundations of the abbey church are presented as a footprint, with walls and column bases that enable the visitor to visualize the scale of the Romanesque abbey.

Abbot Wibald (ruled 1130–58) was one of the greatest patrons of the arts in the 12th century; the Stavelot Triptych of gilded copper and enamels, which contained two fragments of the True Cross, was produced for the Abbey during his rule (about 1156). The binding of the Stavelot Bible, and the remaining fragments from the retable (altar screen) at Stavelot are also high points of medieval art.

In the 16th century, the monk Jean Delvaux claimed to have seen witches and demonic rituals, as he accused several other church officials of engaging in these rituals.

Stavelot was the seat of the Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy, a small independent region of the Holy Roman Empire, ruled by the abbots of Stavelot. The principality was dissolved in 1795 during the French Revolution. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Stavelot was added to the Kingdom of the Netherlands while Malmedy was added to the Prussian Rhineland. In 1830 it became part of Belgium. (Malmedy would also become a part of Belgium, but not until 1919.)

The town&#x27;s coat of arms, granted in 1819, is parted fesswise between Stavelot&#x27;s founding bishop, and the wolf which in Stavelot&#x27;s founding legend carried bricks for the building of the Abbey.

During the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, the city was the scene of severe fighting. From December 18–20, 1944, soldiers belonging to Sixth Panzer Army&#x27;s &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; armored battle group murdered more than 100 civilians, including women and children, as well as American prisoners of war, in Stavelot and the surrounding area. Peiper and some of his officers were after the war tried and convicted for this war crime along with others perpetrated during the same period.

==Attractions==
Stavelot is home to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, the famous venue of the Formula One Belgian Grand Prix and the Spa 24 Hours endurance race.

Stavelot also has a traditional carnival, the &quot;Laetare des Blancs-Moussis&quot;. On Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday of Lent, some 200 local men clad in white and masked with long red noses — the &quot;Blancs-Moussis&quot; — parade through town throwing confetti and beating bystanders with dried pig bladders.

==Climate==
Stavelot has an oceanic climate influenced by its high elevation and inland position towards a more continental type by Belgian standards. Being located at a lower elevation than neighbouring village Malmedy at the other end of the original layout of the Spa-Francorchamps race track, Stavelot is slightly milder, drier and sunnier than Malmedy year round.

<text>Verviers (; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, Belgium.

The municipality consists of the following districts: Ensival, Heusy, Lambermont, Petit-Rechain, Stembert, and Verviers. It is also the center of an agglomeration that includes Dison and Pepinster, making it the second biggest in the province and an important regional center, located roughly halfway between Liège and the German border.

Water has played an important role in the town&#x27;s economy, notably in the development first of its textile and later its tourist industries. As a result, many fountains have been built in Verviers, leading it to be named Wallonia&#x27;s &quot;Water Capital&quot;. The seats of the two Walloon public institutions for water distribution and water treatment are located in the town.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Various flint and bone fragments, as well as Roman coins, were found in this area, attesting to the early settlements in the region. In the 4th century, the Romans had to deal with a constant push of Germanic tribes coming from the east. Successful at first at containing them, they finally had to concede defeat, allowing Clovis&#x27;s Salian Franks to occupy the region at the end of the 5th century. The Verviers area was covered with forests and became a hunting ground for the Merovingian kings, who maintained a vicus in neighbouring Theux. It was also slowly Christianized by the monks of the nearby Abbey of Stavelot.

Late in the 10th century, Charles the Simple ceded the Marquisate of Franchimont to Notker of Liège, one of Notker&#x27;s final steps in consolidating the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. Liège took direct control of the marquisate in 1014, an act which was confirmed by emperor Frederick Barbarossa and by Pope Adrian IV in 1155.

=== 15th century to the present ===
The first mention of a textile industry in this area dates from the 15th century. One century later, the cloth industry took the place of the older metallurgical works, thanks in part to the Eighty Years War raging in the neighbouring Netherlands. The size of the town, however, remained relatively modest. It was only in 1651 that the expansion of the fulleries led to Verviers being recognized as one of the prince-bishopric&#x27;s &quot;bonnes villes&quot; (main cities).

The end of the 18th century was troubled by the French Revolution. The annexation of Liège to France in 1795 caused a steep economic decline and unprecedented poverty. The city&#x27;s fortunes rose again after the Battle of Waterloo (1815). Verviers was at the eastern end of the sillon industriel, the industrial backbone of Wallonia. Although the Napoleonic wars brought economic uncertainty, the textile industry continued to grow throughout this period. Industrialist William Cockerill brought his knowledge of the machines already in British industry and introduced mechanization to the factories of Iwan Simonis starting a new era in the Verviers textile industry. Thereafter, roads were paved, gas lighting was installed, and the city doubled in size thanks to the Industrial Revolution. After World War I, Verviers could share with Bradford the title of &quot;Wool Capital of the World&quot;.

== 2021 floods ==
On the night of 14-15 July, the Vesdre burst its banks and caused massive water damage. There was an exceptionally heavy rainfall that night and the dam of the reservoir at Eupen was opened. The human and material damage was incalculable. People spoke of greater damage than during World War II.

== Economy ==
Verviers was home to a thriving wool and textile industry that was renowned for its quality and contributed greatly to the growth of the town. However, as of the 1950s, the local factories could not face international competition and started closing one after the other which prompted the economic decline of the town. The economy has been slowly recovering since the mid-1990s but remains fragile. Several commercial complexes have opened in recent years in an attempt to revitalize the most affected areas.

== Sights ==
*Verviers counts several museums, including the Wool and Fashion Tourist Centre, housed in a former factory with a Neoclassical-style façade.
*The &quot;Grand Theatre&quot;, also known as &quot;La Bonbonnière&quot;, was built in the same style at the end of the 19th century, while the &quot;Grand Poste&quot; was built in the Neogothic style.
*The city has a number of interesting fountains and thematic strolling paths.

== Demographics ==
Verviers has a significant Muslim population, with the proportion estimated to be approximately 25% as of 2020. Much of Verviers&#x27; Muslim community is impoverished, and suffers from resentment, causing those disillusioned to become attracted to Islamic extremism as seen notably during the 2015 Verviers police raid on Islamists.

The migrant communities also suffer from significant unemployment, and are of mainly Turkish and Moroccan origin. Verviers also has Kurdish, Congolese, Chechen, Somali and Sub-Saharan African communities. Like its sister city of Roubaix in France, and Bradford in Britain, with similarly high Muslim populations, migrants from Africa and Asia moved in the 1960s to Verviers to work in industrial mills, and has suffered from subsequent poverty after its manufacturing was outsourced overseas. Many migrants live in the Hodimont section of the town, where there are several Turkish restaurants, African shops, halal butcheries, and mosques.

<doc id="176157" wikidata="Q310950" url="?curid=176157" title="Thomas Friedman">
<text>Thomas Loren Friedman ( ; born July 20, 1953) is an American political commentator and author. He is a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner who is a weekly columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He has written extensively on foreign affairs, global trade, the Middle East, globalization, and environmental issues.

Friedman began his career as a reporter and won two Pulitzer Prizes in the 1980s for his coverage on conflict in Lebanon and politics in Israel, followed by a further prize in 2002 for commentary on the war on terror.

==Early life and education==

Friedman was born on July 20, 1953, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Margaret Blanche (née Phillips) and Harold Abe Friedman. Harold, who was vice president of a ball bearing company, United Bearing, died of a heart attack in 1973 when Tom was nineteen years old. Margaret, who served in the United States Navy during World War II and studied Home Economics at the University of Wisconsin, was a homemaker and a part-time bookkeeper. Margaret was also a Senior Life Master duplicate bridge player, and died in 2008. Friedman has two older sisters, Shelly and Jane. From an early age, Friedman, whose father often took him to the golf course for a round after work, wanted to be a professional golfer. He played a lot of sports, and became serious about tennis and golf. He caddied at a local country club and in 1970 caddied for professional golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez when the US Open came to town.

Friedman is Jewish. He attended Hebrew school five days a week until his Bar Mitzvah, then St. Louis Park High School, where he wrote articles for his school&#x27;s newspaper. He became enamored with Israel after a visit there in December 1968, and he spent all three of his high school summers living on Kibbutz HaHotrim, near Haifa. He has characterized his high school years as &quot;one big celebration of Israel&#x27;s victory in the Six-Day War.&quot;

Friedman studied at the University of Minnesota for two years, but later transferred to Brandeis University and graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1975 with a degree in Mediterranean studies. Friedman also pursued Arabic studies at The American University in Cairo, where he graduated in 1974 from its Arabic language unit (ALU). Friedman later taught a class in economics at Brandeis in 2006, and was a commencement speaker there in 2007. After graduating from Brandeis, he attended St Antony&#x27;s College at the University of Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, earning an M.Phil. in Middle Eastern studies.

==Journalism career==

Friedman joined the London bureau of United Press International after completing his master&#x27;s degree. He was dispatched a year later to Beirut, where he lived from June 1979 to May 1981 while covering the Lebanon Civil War. He was hired by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a reporter in 1981 and re-dispatched to Beirut at the start of the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. His coverage of the war, particularly the Sabra and Shatila massacre, won him the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting (shared with Loren Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;). Alongside David K. Shipler, he also won the George Polk Award for foreign reporting.

In June 1984, Friedman was transferred to Jerusalem, where he served as the &quot;New York Times&quot; Jerusalem Bureau Chief until February 1988. That year he received a second Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting, which cited his coverage of the First Palestinian Intifada. He wrote a book, &quot;From Beirut to Jerusalem&quot;, describing his experiences in the Middle East, which won the 1989 U.S. National Book Award for Nonfiction.

Friedman covered Secretary of State James Baker during the administration of President George H. W. Bush. Following the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, Friedman became the White House correspondent for the &quot;New York Times&quot;. In 1994, he began to write more about foreign policy and economics, and moved to the op-ed page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; the following year as a foreign affairs columnist. In 2002, Friedman won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his &quot;clarity of vision, based on extensive reporting, in commenting on the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat.&quot;

In February 2002, Friedman met Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and encouraged him to make a comprehensive attempt to end the Arab–Israeli conflict by normalizing Arab relations with Israel in exchange for the return of refugees alongside an end to the Israel territorial occupations. Abdullah proposed the Arab Peace Initiative at the Beirut Summit that March, which Friedman has since strongly supported.

Friedman received the 2004 Overseas Press Club Award for lifetime achievement and the same year was named to the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. In May 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that President Barack Obama &quot;has sounded out&quot; Friedman concerning Middle East issues.

==Views==
Friedman has been criticized for his staunch advocacy of the Iraq War, as well as unregulated trade, and his early support of Saudi Royal Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

=== Aadhaar ===
Friedman has publicly expressed his support for the biometrics based Unique Identification program of India. When asked about the privacy concerns raised by the UID program in India he said:

===Globalization===
Friedman first discussed his views on globalization in the book &quot;The Lexus and the Olive Tree&quot; (1999). In 2004, visits to Bangalore, India, and Dalian, China, led Friedman to write a follow-up analysis, &quot;The World Is Flat&quot; (2005). Friedman believes that individual countries must sacrifice some degree of economic sovereignty to global institutions (such as capital markets and multinational corporations), a situation he has termed the &quot;golden straitjacket&quot;.

In 2000, Friedman championed Free Trade with The People&#x27;s Republic of China, claiming that Free Trade would make China more democratic. He has also expressed concern about the United States&#x27; lack of energy independence. He has stated, &quot;First rule of oil—addicts never tell the truth to their pushers. We are the addicts, the oil producers are the pushers—we&#x27;ve never had an honest conversation with the Saudis.&quot;

In 2007, Friedman viewed American immigration laws as too restrictive and damaging to U.S. economic output: &quot;It is pure idiocy that Congress will not open our borders—as wide as possible—to attract and keep the world&#x27;s first-round intellectual draft choices in an age when everyone increasingly has the same innovation tools and the key differentiator is human talent.&quot;

After visiting the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego, California in early April 2019, Friedman wrote, &quot;The whole day left me more certain than ever that we have a real immigration crisis and that the solution is a high wall with a big gate—but a smart gate.&quot;

===Terrorism===
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Friedman&#x27;s writing focused more on the threat of terrorism and the Middle East. He was awarded the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Commentary &quot;for his clarity of vision, based on extensive reporting, in commenting on the worldwide impact of the terrorist threat&quot;. These columns were collected and published in the book &quot;Longitudes and Attitudes&quot;. For a while, his reporting on post-9/11 topics led him to diverge from his prior interests in technological advances and globalization, until he began to research &quot;The World Is Flat&quot;.

After the 7/7 London bombings, Friedman called for the U.S. State Department to &quot;shine a spotlight on hate speech wherever it appears&quot;, and to create a quarterly &quot;War of Ideas Report, which would focus on those religious leaders and writers who are inciting violence against others&quot;. Friedman said the governmental speech-monitoring should go beyond those who actually advocate violence, and include also those whom former State Department spokesperson Jamie Rubin calls &quot;excuse makers&quot;. In his July 22 column, Friedman wrote against the &quot;excuses&quot; made by terrorists or apologists who blame their actions on third-party influences or pressures. &quot;After every major terrorist incident, the excuse makers come out to tell us ... why the terrorists acted. These excuse makers are just one notch less despicable than the terrorists and also deserve to be exposed. When you live in an open society like London, where anyone with a grievance can publish an article, run for office or start a political movement, the notion that blowing up a busload of innocent civilians in response to Iraq is somehow &quot;understandable&quot; is outrageous. &quot;It erases the distinction between legitimate dissent and terrorism&quot; Mr. Rubin said, &quot;and an open society needs to maintain a clear wall between them.&quot; As part of their response to this column, the editors at FAIR encouraged their readers to contact Friedman and inform him that &quot;opponents of the Iraq War do not deserve to be on a government blacklist-even if they oppose the war because they believe it encourages terrorism&quot;.

===Kosovo War===
During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Friedman wrote the following in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on April 23, 1999: &quot;Like it or not, we are at war with the Serbian nation (the Serbs certainly think so), and the stakes have to be very clear: Every week you ravage Kosovo is another decade we will set your country back by pulverizing you. You want 1950? We can do 1950. You want 1389? We can do 1389 too.&quot; Friedman urged the US to destroy &quot;in Belgrade: every power grid, water pipe, bridge [and] road&quot;, annex Albania and Macedonia as &quot;U.S. protectorates&quot;, &quot;occupy the Balkans for years&quot;, and &quot;[g]ive war a chance.&quot;

Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) labeled Friedman&#x27;s remarks &quot;war-mongering&quot; and &quot;crude race-hatred and war-crime agitation&quot;. Steve Chapman, critical of the response taken by NATO, referred to Friedman as &quot;the most fervent supporter of the air war&quot; and ironically asked in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;Why stop at 1389? Why not revive the idea, proposed but never adopted in Vietnam, of bombing the enemy all the way back to the Stone Age?&quot; Norman Solomon asserted in 2007 that &quot;a tone of sadism could be discerned&quot; in Friedman&#x27;s article.

===Iraq===
Friedman supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that the establishment of a democratic state in the Middle East would force other countries in the region to liberalize and modernize. In his February 9, 2003, column for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction:
Nevertheless, he found the incoherence of the American position to be an asset, arguing that &quot;the axis-of-evil idea isn&#x27;t thought through -- but that&#x27;s what I like about it. (...) There is a lot about the Bush team&#x27;s foreign policy I don&#x27;t like, but their willingness to restore our deterrence, and to be as crazy as some of our enemies, is one thing they have right. It is the only way we&#x27;re going to get our turkey back.

After the invasion, Friedman expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair for &quot;hyping&quot; the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy &quot;would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq&#x27;s fractious history&quot;. In January 2004, he participated in a forum on &quot;Slate&quot; called &quot;Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War&quot;, in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq&#x27;s lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions:
In his September 29, 2005, column in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Friedman entertained the idea of supporting the Kurds and Shias in a civil war against the Sunnis: &quot;If they [the Sunnis] won&#x27;t come around, we should arm the Shiites and Kurds and leave the Sunnis of Iraq to reap the wind.&quot;

Critics of Friedman&#x27;s position on the Iraq War have noted his recurrent assertion that &quot;the next six months&quot; will prove critical in determining the outcome of the conflict. A May 2006 study by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting cited 14 examples of Friedman&#x27;s declaring the next &quot;few months&quot; or &quot;six months&quot; as a decisive or critical period, dating from in November 2003, describing it as &quot;a long series of similar do-or-die dates that never seem to get any closer&quot;. The blogger Atrios coined the neologism &quot;Friedman Unit&quot; to refer to this unit of time in relation to Iraq, noting its use as a supposedly critical window of opportunity.

In a live television interview aired June 11, 2006, on CNN, Howard Kurtz asked Friedman about the concept: &quot;Now, I want to understand how a columnist&#x27;s mind works when you take positions, because you were chided recently for writing several times in different occasions &#x27;the next six months are crucial in Iraq.&#x27;&quot; Friedman responded: &quot;The fact is that the outcome there is unclear, and I reflected that in my column. And I will continue to reflect.&quot; Responding to prodding from Stephen Colbert, Friedman said in 2007: &quot;We&#x27;ve run out of six months. It&#x27;s really time to set a deadline.&quot;

===Environment===
&quot;Iran&#x27;s Great Weakness May Be Its Oil&quot;, by Thomas Friedman, challenges and debates conflicts about oil. Friedman states,&quot;The best tool we have for curbing Iran&#x27;s influence is not containment or engagement, but getting the price of oil down in the long term with conservation and an alternative-energy strategy. Let&#x27;s exploit Iran&#x27;s oil addiction by ending ours&quot;. In &quot;Hot, Flat, and Crowded&quot;, he says that &quot;any car company that gets taxpayer money must demonstrate a plan for transforming every vehicle in its fleet to a hybrid-electric engine with flex-fuel capability, so its entire fleet can also run on next generation cellulosic ethanol&quot;.

In a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman described his motivations for writing the book: &quot;My concern is about America... Demand for clean energy, clean fuel and energy efficiency is clearly going to explode; it&#x27;s going to be the next great global industry. I know that as sure as I know that I&#x27;m sitting here at De Anza College talking to you. By being big in the next big thing, we&#x27;ll be seen by the rest of the world as working on the most important problem in the world.&quot; Some of Friedman&#x27;s environmental critics question his support of still-undeveloped coal pollution mitigation technology (&quot;clean coal&quot;) and coal mining as emblematic of Friedman&#x27;s less than &quot;green&quot; commitment to renewable energy.

===Israel===
Friedman has been criticized by organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting for defending Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon as a form of &quot;educating&quot; Israel&#x27;s opponents; according to FAIR, Friedman was explicitly endorsing terrorism by Israel against Lebanese and Palestinians. Journalist Glenn Greenwald and professor Noam Chomsky also accused Friedman of endorsing and encouraging terrorism by Israeli forces.

Political reporter Belen Fernandez heavily critiques Friedman&#x27;s commentary regarding Israel. Among other criticisms, Fernandez singles out Friedman&#x27;s suggestion that Israeli forces were unaware that their allied Lebanese militias carried out the Sabra and Shatila massacre while under their guard, contradicting the assessments of other journalists and observers; his encouragement of strong-armed force by the Israeli army against Palestinians; and his opposition to settlements only on the grounds that they are counter-productive, rather than because they violate international law or cause suffering for Palestinians. Fernandez suggests that Friedman is most worried about successfully maintaining Israel&#x27;s Jewish ethnocracy and actively opposing a &quot;one-man, one-vote&quot; system of democracy.

Friedman has also come under criticism from supporters of Israel. In an op-ed, Yitzhak Benhorin criticized Friedman&#x27;s alleged suggestion that Israel relinquish territory it had occupied in the 1967 Middle Eastern War. Friedman sparked criticism for writing that congressional ovations for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were &quot;bought and paid for by the Israel lobby.&quot; A letter from the American Jewish Committee objected that &quot;Public opinion polls consistently show a high level of American ... support for and identification with Israel. This indicates that the people&#x27;s elected representatives are fully reflecting the will of the voters.&quot; Friedman responded to criticism by writing: &quot;In retrospect I probably should have used a more precise term like &#x27;engineered&#x27; by the Israel lobby – a term that does not suggest grand conspiracy theories that I don&#x27;t subscribe to.&quot;

Friedman hailed the Trump-brokered peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates as &quot;exactly what Trump said it was in his tweet: a &#x27;HUGE breakthrough. In July 2023, as the Netanyahu’s government proposed new laws leading to judicial reform intended to limit the powers of Israel’s Supreme Court, Friedman wrote an opinion piece supporting the Biden government’s changing diplomatic approach toward Israel. Following the outbreak of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Friedman urged Israel against military over-reach and further settlement expansions, saying to do so otherwise would risk destabilizing the region and the US-Israel alliance.

===China===
In September 2009, Friedman wrote an article praising China&#x27;s one-party autocracy, saying that China&#x27;s leaders are &quot;boosting gasoline prices&quot; and &quot;overtaking us in electric cars, solar power, energy efficiency, batteries, nuclear power and wind power.&quot; The article was in turn subject to critical analysis: Matt Lewis who wrote, &quot;Friedman&#x27;s apparent wish for a &#x27;benign&#x27; dictator is utopian, inasmuch as it ignores Lord Acton&#x27;s warning that &#x27;absolute power corrupts absolutely.&#x27;&quot; and William Easterly who quotes Friedman&#x27;s one-party autocracy assertions as part of his academic paper in which he concluded that, &quot;Formal theory and evidence provides little or no basis on which to believe the benevolent autocrat story&quot; and that, &quot;economists should retain their traditional skepticism for stories that have little good theory or empirics to support them.&quot; However, in a July 2012 article in the NYT, he also wrote that the current Chinese leadership has not used its surging economic growth to also introduce gradual political reform and that, &quot;Corruption is as bad as ever, institutionalized transparency and rule of law remain weak and consensual politics nonexistent.&quot; When asked if he had &quot;China envy&quot; during a Fresh Dialogues interview, Friedman replied, &quot;You detect the envy of someone who wants his own government to act democratically with the same effectiveness that China can do autocratically.&quot; Likewise, in a 2011 interview with the BBC Friedman says that he wants his children to live in a world where &quot;there&#x27;s a strong America counterbalancing a strong and thriving China, and not one where you have a strong and rising China and an America that is uncertain, weak and unable to project power economically and militarily it historically did.&quot;

Friedman&#x27;s work is popular in China. His book &quot;The World is Flat&quot; was a bestseller in the country, although criticism of China in the book was removed when it was published in the country. A translated version of his article from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;China Needs Its Own Dream&quot;, has been credited with popularizing the phrase &quot;Chinese Dream&quot; in China, a term that was later adopted as a slogan by Xi Jinping. Friedman, in the magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, has attributed the phrase to Peggy Liu and her environmental NGO JUCCCE.

In September 2020, Friedman told CNBC that &quot;Trump is not the American president America deserves, in my opinion. But he definitely is the American president China deserved. We needed to have a president who was going to call the game with China. And Trump has done it, with I would say more grit and toughness than any of his predecessors. I give him credit for that.&quot; In November the same year, Friedman observed that Xi Jinping had brought about &quot;an end to four decades of steady integration of China’s economy with the West&quot;.

===Iran===
As the Iran nuclear deal agreement reached between Iran and a group of world powers (the P5+1). In Friedman&#x27;s interview, he mentioned that &quot;Our view of the Middle East is deeply colored by Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and they all have their own interest. 15 of the 19 hijackers on 911 were from Saudi Arabia, none from Iran! Iranians had a spontaneous demonstration to support Americans on 911.&quot; He added, &quot;What strikes you most about Iran (vs. Saudi Arabia) is that Iran has real politics... A country of 85 million people, a great civilization, many educated men and women, if they want to get a bomb they will get it. They have demonstrated they could do it under the most severe sanctions... Show me where Iranians have acted reckless [like Saddam Hussein]. These are survivors.&quot;

On February 2, 2024, Friedman penned a allegorical op-ed entitled, &quot;Understanding the Middle East Through the Animal Kingdom&quot;, in which he posited Iran as a metaphorical &quot;parasitoid wasp&quot; with proxies in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria, as caterpillars. Friedman claimed &quot;We [America] have no counterstrategy that safely and efficiently kills the wasp without setting fire to the whole jungle&quot;, suggesting that America militarily destroy the entire Middle East to annihilate Iran and its allies. He concluded that he could &quot;contemplate&quot; the Middle East by watching Animal Planet. The New Arab reported that it has been criticized for racism and orientalism.

===Radical centrism===
In the 2010s, Friedman wrote several columns supporting the politics of radical centrism. In one he stated that, if the &quot;radical center wants to be empowered, it can&#x27;t just whine. It needs its own grass-roots movement&quot;. In another column Friedman promoted Americans Elect, an organization trying to field a radical-centrist candidate for the 2012 U.S. presidential election. That column decried &quot;the two-party duopoly that has dominated American political life&quot;. Friedman&#x27;s radical-centrist columns received a considerable amount of criticism, particularly from liberals.

==Personal life==
Friedman&#x27;s wife, Ann (née Bucksbaum) is a teacher and a native of Marshalltown, Iowa. A graduate of Stanford University and the London School of Economics, she is the daughter of real estate developer Matthew Bucksbaum, whom Friedman describes as his &quot;best friend&quot;. They were married in London on Thanksgiving Day 1978 and live in an 11,400-square-foot mansion in Bethesda, Maryland. They have two daughters, Orly (born 1985) and Natalie (born 1988).

Friedman supported Hillary Clinton for President of the United States in the 2016 election, and supported Michael Bloomberg in the 2020 primaries. He supported Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election. Friedman is on the board of directors for Planet Word, a private museum dedicated to language based in Washington, D.C.

<text>Polymer physics is the field of physics that studies polymers, their fluctuations, mechanical properties, as well as the kinetics of reactions involving degradation of polymers and polymerisation of monomers.

While it focuses on the perspective of condensed matter physics, polymer physics was originally a branch of statistical physics. Polymer physics and polymer chemistry are also related to the field of polymer science, which is considered to be the applicative part of polymers.

Polymers are large molecules and thus are very complicated for solving using a deterministic method. Yet, statistical approaches can yield results and are often pertinent, since large polymers (i.e., polymers with many monomers) are describable efficiently in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely many monomers (although the actual size is clearly finite).

Thermal fluctuations continuously affect the shape of polymers in liquid solutions, and modeling their effect requires the use of principles from statistical mechanics and dynamics. As a corollary, temperature strongly affects the physical behavior of polymers in solution, causing phase transitions, melts, and so on.

The statistical approach to polymer physics is based on an analogy between polymer behavior and either Brownian motion or another type of a random walk, the self-avoiding walk. The simplest possible polymer model is presented by the ideal chain, corresponding to a simple random walk. Experimental approaches for characterizing polymers are also common, using polymer characterization methods, such as size exclusion chromatography, viscometry, dynamic light scattering, and Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) for determining the chemical, physical, and material properties of polymers. These experimental methods help the mathematical modeling of polymers and give a better understanding of the properties of polymers.

* Flory is considered the first scientist establishing the field of polymer physics.
* French scientists contributed since the 70s (e.g. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, J. des Cloizeaux).
* Doi and Edwards wrote a famous book in polymer physics.
* Soviet/Russian school of physics (I. M. Lifshitz, A. Yu. Grosberg, A.R. Khokhlov, V.N. Pokrovskii) have been very active in the development of polymer physics.

==Models==

Models of polymer chains are split into two types: &quot;ideal&quot; models, and &quot;real&quot; models. Ideal chain models assume that there are no interactions between chain monomers. This assumption is valid for certain polymeric systems, where the positive and negative interactions between the monomer effectively cancel out. Ideal chain models provide a good starting point for the investigation of more complex systems and are better suited for equations with more parameters.

===Ideal chains=== 
* The freely-jointed chain is the simplest model of a polymer. In this model, fixed length polymer segments are linearly connected, and all bond and torsion angles are equiprobable. The polymer can therefore be described by a simple random walk and ideal chain. The model can be extended to include extensible segments in order to represent bond stretching.
* The freely-rotating chain improves the freely-jointed chain model by taking into account that polymer segments make a fixed bond angle to neighbouring units because of specific chemical bonding. Under this fixed angle, the segments are still free to rotate and all torsion angles are equally likely.
* The hindered rotation model assumes that the torsion angle is hindered by a potential energy. This makes the probability of each torsion angle proportional to a Boltzmann factor:

:formula_1, where formula_2 is the potential determining the probability of each value of formula_3.

* In the rotational isomeric state model, the allowed torsion angles are determined by the positions of the minima in the rotational potential energy. Bond lengths and bond angles are constant.
* The Worm-like chain is a more complex model. It takes the persistence length into account. Polymers are not completely flexible; bending them requires energy. At the length scale below persistence length, the polymer behaves more or less like a rigid rod.
* The finite extensible nonlinear elastic model takes into account non-linearity for finite chains. It is used for computational simulations.

===Real chains===

Interactions between chain monomers can be modelled as excluded volume. This causes a reduction in the conformational possibilities of the chain, and leads to a self-avoiding random walk. Self-avoiding random walks have different statistics to simple random walks.

==Solvent and temperature effect==

The statistics of a single polymer chain depends upon the solubility of the polymer in the solvent. For a solvent in which the polymer is very soluble (a &quot;good&quot; solvent), the chain is more expanded, while for a solvent in which the polymer is insoluble or barely soluble (a &quot;bad&quot; solvent), the chain segments stay close to each other. In the limit of a very bad solvent the polymer chain merely collapses to form a hard sphere, while in a good solvent the chain swells in order to maximize the number of polymer-fluid contacts. For this case the radius of gyration is approximated using Flory&#x27;s mean field approach which yields a scaling for the radius of gyration of:
::formula_4,
where formula_5 is the radius of gyration of the polymer, formula_6 is the number of bond segments (equal to the degree of polymerization) of the chain and formula_7 is the Flory exponent.

For good solvent, formula_8; for poor solvent, formula_9. Therefore, polymer in good solvent has larger size and behaves like a fractal object. In bad solvent it behaves like a solid sphere.

In the so-called formula_3 solvent, formula_11, which is the result of simple random walk. The chain behaves as if it were an ideal chain.

The quality of solvent depends also on temperature. For a flexible polymer, low temperature may correspond to poor quality and high temperature makes the same solvent good. At a particular temperature called theta (θ) temperature, the solvent behaves as an ideal chain.

==Excluded volume interaction==
The ideal chain model assumes that polymer segments can overlap with each other as if the chain were a phantom chain. In reality, two segments cannot occupy the same space at the same time. This interaction between segments is called the excluded volume interaction.

The simplest formulation of excluded volume is the self-avoiding random walk, a random walk that cannot repeat its previous path. A path of this walk of &quot;N&quot; steps in three dimensions represents a conformation of a polymer with excluded volume interaction. Because of the self-avoiding nature of this model, the number of possible conformations is significantly reduced. The radius of gyration is generally larger than that of the ideal chain.

==Flexibility and reptation==
Whether a polymer is flexible or not depends on the scale of interest. For example, the persistence length of double-stranded DNA is about 50 nm. Looking at length scale smaller than 50 nm, it behaves more or less like a rigid rod. At length scale much larger than 50 nm, it behaves like a flexible chain.

Reptation is the thermal motion of very long linear, &quot;entangled&quot; basically
macromolecules in polymer melts or concentrated polymer solutions. Derived from the word reptile, reptation suggests the movement of entangled polymer chains as being analogous to snakes slithering through one another. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes introduced (and named) the concept of reptation into polymer physics in 1971 to explain the dependence of the mobility of a macromolecule on its length. Reptation is used as a mechanism to explain viscous flow in an amorphous polymer. Sir Sam Edwards and Masao Doi later refined reptation theory. The consistent theory of thermal motion of polymers was given by Vladimir Pokrovskii 
. Similar phenomena also occur in proteins.

==Example model (simple random-walk, freely jointed)==

The study of long chain polymers has been a source of problems within the realms of statistical mechanics since about the 1950s. One of the reasons however that scientists were interested in their study is that the equations governing the behavior of a polymer chain were independent of the chain chemistry. What is more, the governing equation turns out to be a random walk, or diffusive walk, in space. Indeed, the Schrödinger equation is itself a diffusion equation in imaginary time, &quot;t&#x27; = it&quot;.

===Random walks in time===
The first example of a random walk is one in space, whereby a particle undergoes a random motion due to external forces in its surrounding medium. A typical example would be a pollen grain in a beaker of water. If one could somehow &quot;dye&quot; the path the pollen grain has taken, the path observed is defined as a random walk.

Consider a toy problem, of a train moving along a 1D track in the x-direction. Suppose that the train moves either a distance of +&quot;b&quot; or −&quot;b&quot; (&quot;b&quot; is the same for each step), depending on whether a coin lands heads or tails when flipped. Lets start by considering the statistics of the steps the toy train takes (where &quot;Si&quot; is the ith step taken):

:formula_12 ; due to &quot;a priori&quot; equal probabilities
:formula_13

The second quantity is known as the correlation function. The delta is the kronecker delta which tells us that if the indices &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are different, then the result is 0, but if &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot; then the kronecker delta is 1, so the correlation function returns a value of &quot;b&quot;2. This makes sense, because if &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot; then we are considering the same step. Rather trivially then it can be shown that the average displacement of the train on the x-axis is 0;

:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16

As stated formula_17, so the sum is still 0. 
It can also be shown, using the same method demonstrated above, to calculate the root mean square value of problem. The result of this calculation is given below

:formula_18

From the diffusion equation it can be shown that the distance a diffusing particle moves in a medium is proportional to the root of the time the system has been diffusing for, where the proportionality constant is the root of the diffusion constant. The above relation, although cosmetically different reveals similar physics, where &quot;N&quot; is simply the number of steps moved (is loosely connected with time) and &quot;b&quot; is the characteristic step length. As a consequence we can consider diffusion as a random walk process.

===Random walks in space===

Random walks in space can be thought of as snapshots of the path taken by a random walker in time. One such example is the spatial configuration of long chain polymers.

There are two types of random walk in space: &quot;self-avoiding random walks&quot;, where the links of the polymer chain interact and do not overlap in space, and &quot;pure random&quot; walks, where the links of the polymer chain are non-interacting and links are free to lie on top of one another. The former type is most applicable to physical systems, but their solutions are harder to get at from first principles.

By considering a freely jointed, non-interacting polymer chain, the end-to-end vector is 
:formula_19
where r&quot;i&quot; is the vector position of the &quot;i&quot;-th link in the chain. 
As a result of the central limit theorem, if &quot;N&quot; ≫ 1 then we expect a Gaussian distribution for the end-to-end vector. We can also make statements of the statistics of the links themselves;

* formula_20 ; by the isotropy of space
* formula_21 ; all the links in the chain are uncorrelated with one another

Using the statistics of the individual links, it is easily shown that 
:formula_22
:formula_23.
Notice this last result is the same as that found for random walks in time.

Assuming, as stated, that that distribution of end-to-end vectors for a very large number of identical polymer chains is gaussian, the probability distribution has the following form

:formula_24

What use is this to us? Recall that according to the principle of equally likely &quot;a priori&quot; probabilities, the number of microstates, Ω, at some physical value is directly proportional to the probability distribution at that physical value, &quot;viz&quot;;

:formula_25

where &quot;c&quot; is an arbitrary proportionality constant. Given our distribution function, there is a maxima corresponding to R = 0. Physically this amounts to there being more microstates which have an end-to-end vector of 0 than any other microstate. Now by considering

:formula_26
:formula_27
:formula_28

where &quot;F&quot; is the Helmholtz free energy, and it can be shown that

:formula_29

which has the same form as the potential energy of a spring, obeying Hooke&#x27;s law.

This result is known as the &quot;entropic spring result&quot; and amounts to saying that upon stretching a polymer chain you are doing work on the system to drag it away from its (preferred) equilibrium state. An example of this is a common elastic band, composed of long chain (rubber) polymers. By stretching the elastic band you are doing work on the system and the band behaves like a conventional spring, except that unlike the case with a metal spring, all of the work done appears immediately as thermal energy, much as in the thermodynamically similar case of compressing an ideal gas in a piston.

It might at first be astonishing that the work done in stretching the polymer chain can be related entirely to the change in entropy of the system as a result of the stretching. However, this is typical of systems that do not store any energy as potential energy, such as ideal gases. That such systems are entirely driven by entropy changes at a given temperature, can be seen whenever it is the case that are allowed to do work on the surroundings (such as when an elastic band does work on the environment by contracting, or an ideal gas does work on the environment by expanding). Because the free energy change in such cases derives entirely from entropy change rather than internal (potential) energy conversion, in both cases the work done can be drawn entirely from thermal energy in the polymer, with 100% efficiency of conversion of thermal energy to work. In both the ideal gas and the polymer, this is made possible by a material entropy increase from contraction that makes up for the loss of entropy from absorption of the thermal energy, and cooling of the material.

<text>Bram Moolenaar (; 1961 – 3 August 2023) was a Dutch software engineer and activist who was the creator, maintainer, and benevolent dictator for life of Vim, a vi-derivative text editor. He advocated for ICCF Holland, a non-governmental organization supporting AIDS victims in Uganda, and used the popularity of Vim to encourage donations.

From July 2006 until September 2021, Moolenaar was employed by Google, working in the Zürich office on Google Calendar. He spent part of his time maintaining Vim.

==Early life and education==
Moolenaar was born in Lisse, Netherlands, in 1961. In 1985, he graduated from the Delft University of Technology with a degree in electrical engineering.

==Vim==
In 1988, Moolenaar purchased an Amiga computer. Familiar with vi, which had not been ported to the Amiga at the time, he tested several clones of vi, including Stevie. Moolenaar took the source code of Stevie and improved upon it. Seeking to match vi, Moolenaar eventually added in additional features, such as undoing multiple levels. The first version of &quot;Vi IMitation&quot; was released in 1988 on a public domain disk set made by Fred Fish. Several users ported Vim onto other platforms, such as MS-DOS and Unix. In version 1.22 in 1992, Vi IMitation was renamed to &quot;Vi IMproved&quot;.

Vim is open-source and charityware; users are encouraged to donate to ICCF Holland. A number of other applications have been licensed this way since Vim&#x27;s inception. Vim has won several awards and has been referred to as one of the most popular text editors.

==Other ventures==
Other software tools that Moolenaar developed include a software build tool written in Python, called A-A-P, which is similar to make, and a programming language called Zimbu which puts an emphasis on readability of programs.

Moolenaar was a member of the Dutch Unix user group, NLUUG, which presented him with an award during its 25th anniversary, for his creation of Vim and his contributions to open-source software in general.

===Charity===
Moolenaar was an advocate of ICCF Holland, a non-governmental organization based in Kibaale, Uganda which he founded to support children whose parents have died of AIDS. In 1994, he volunteered as a water and sanitation engineer for the Kibaale Children&#x27;s Centre; he made several return trips over the following twenty-five years. In 1995, he made Vim charityware. An estimated was raised for ICCF Holland in 1997, followed by a year later. In 1999, donation income totaled approximately . He last visited the Kibaale Community Centre in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Illness and death==
Moolenaar reported health problems in October 2022.

On 5 August 2023, Moolenaar&#x27;s family announced in the Vim Google Group that Moolenaar had died two days prior, at the age of 62, because of a rapidly developing medical condition. His funeral was held in Lisse, The Netherlands, on 16 August 2023. Vim will be continued by co-contributor Christian Brabandt.

== Posthumous fame ==
Bram Moolenaar was posthumously awarded the 2024 European SFS Award at SFSCON 24, a free software meeting organized since 2004 by the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) and the Linux User Group Bolzano-Bozen (LUGBZ).

<text>Waremme (; ; ) is a city and municipality of Wallonia located in the province of Liège, in Belgium. 

The city is located on the River Geer (), in the loessic Haspengouw region. The economy is based on the cultivation of cereals and sugar beet, and on the food industry.

The municipality includes the following districts: Bettincourt, Bleret, Bovenistier, Grand-Axhe, Lantremange, Oleye, and Waremme.

==History==
Several findings were unearthed near Waremme containing remnants of Neolithic and Bronze Age settlements. The main Roman road linking Bavai to Cologne passed right through the territory. Tumuli and Roman villas were found nearby. Romans have also left a horse burial.

The medieval hamlet of &quot;Woromia&quot; was cited for the first time in 965. On February 5, 1078, &quot;Woromia&quot; was ceded to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, together with its castle, five mills, and six breweries. By 1215, with its 815 inhabitants, it had grown to town size. Its frontier position near the Duchy of Brabant, however, attracted several raids from the duke, causing it to be burnt to the ground and rebuilt at least a couple of times. In the 14th century, the town built a market place and a hospital, slowly becoming an important regional center, where coins were issued and important meetings held.

During his conquest of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, Charles the Bold burnt the city once more in 1468. In the 16th century, the town became one of the 21 &quot;bonnes villes&quot; (main cities) of the prince-bishopric. In 1748, a quarter of the city was again destroyed by fire, this time accidentally. In 1792, the French Revolutionary troops entered the city and closed the convents. Three years later, the Prince-Bishopric of Liège was dissolved and the city became French.

The 19th century was prosperous, thanks to the advent of the railways linking Mechelen to Ans, and the construction of two sugar refineries and several schools. In 1904, Guillaume Moës established his engine and locomotive company Ateliers Moës-Freres in Waremme; they continued manufacturing in the town until October 2013. World War I did not bring any destruction to the city, except for that of the old surrounding walls. World War II, however, was a lot worse as half of the city was destroyed by air raids, only days before Liberation Day. The city then counted about 5,000 inhabitants.

==Attractions==

*The City Hall dates from 1900.
*The town&#x27;s main church dates from 1881 and houses 14th-century baptismal fonts.
*A natural reserve can also be found on the territory of Waremme.

==Person born in Waremme==

<text>&quot;&quot; (&#x27;The Maltese Hymn&#x27;) is the national anthem of Malta. It was written in the form of a prayer to God. Officially adopted in 1964 upon independence from the United Kingdom, the music was composed by Robert Samut, and the lyrics were written by Dun Karm Psaila.

== History ==
Between the mid-19th century and the early 1930s, Malta was passing through a national awakening. With the increased national awareness, it was felt by many thinkers that Malta should have its own national anthem. In 1850, Ġan Anton Vassallo composed &quot;Innu Lil Malta&quot;, which used to be played during many Maltese political manifestations and meetings. In 1922, Robert Samut composed a short melody. A year later, A.V. Laferla, director of primary schools in Malta, obtained possession of this composition, as he wanted to have an anthem that could be sung by students in Malta&#x27;s schools. Laferla asked Dun Karm to write lyrics that would fit with Samut&#x27;s short melody. The poems of Dun Karm Psaila are well known for their religious and patriotic currents, and so are the verses written for Samut&#x27;s anthem. The hymn was already being sung in December 1922, mostly in governmental schools. The first time it was heard in public was on 27 December 1922 and again on 6 January 1923, during two concerts at the Manoel Theatre. However, during its two first appearances, someone had changed some verses from the first stanza. This angered Dun Karm, who protested by writing an article in a local newspaper. Since then, the lyrics have remained unchanged. On 3 February 1923, another concert was held at the Manoel Theatre, performed by children from Sliema, with Dun Karm&#x27;s original verses. The hymn was played by the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Band, of Vittoriosa.

The Maltese government declared the anthem as the official Maltese anthem on 22 February 1941. In 1942, it was printed for &quot;Piano e canto&quot; with an English translation by May Butcher. This publication helped spread its popularity. The 1964 Independence Constitution confirmed it as the National Anthem of Malta, which is today one of the symbols of Maltese identity.

On 25 March 1945, in the Gżira Stadium, a football match was held between a Malta XI and Hajduk Split, a team from Yugoslavia. At that time, Malta was still under British rule, and the British governor was present. Before the game, the band played the anthem of Yugoslavia, and then it played that of Great Britain, due to Malta&#x27;s status as a colony. As the governor was about to sit, the attendees in the stadium stood up and sang the Maltese anthem. The governor, albeit embarrassed, stood up as well until the end of the anthem.

The anthem is played during all the official duties of the President of Malta, the Prime Minister of Malta and other important governmental personalities. It is played during all important national activities.
