<text>The Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) is the first of a number of general Terrorism Acts passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It superseded and repealed the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996. It also replaced parts of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998. The powers it provides the police have been controversial, leading to noted cases of alleged abuse, and to legal challenges in British and European courts. The stop-and-search powers under section 44 of the Act have been ruled illegal by the European Court of Human Rights.

==Definition of terrorism==
Terrorism is defined, in the first section of the Act, as follows:

Sections (2)(b) and (e) have been criticised as falling well outside the scope of what is generally understood to be the definition of terrorism, i.e. acts that require life-threatening violence.

Prior to this, terrorism was defined in an Act as a footnote, such as Reinsurance (Acts of Terrorism) Act 1993 (c. 18) section 2(2):

&quot;acts of terrorism&quot; means acts of persons acting on behalf of, or in connection with, any organisation which carries out activities directed towards the overthrowing or influencing, by force or violence, of Her Majesty&#x27;s government in the United Kingdom or any other government de jure or de facto.

and Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 (c. 4) section 20(1):

In this Act &quot;terrorism&quot; means the use of violence for political ends, and includes any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear.

In the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, the criminal offences referred to as terrorism are provided as an exhaustive list of over 70 items.

This move to establish a sound definition of terrorism in the law made it possible to build an entirely new set of police and investigatory powers into incidents of this kind, beyond what they could do for ordinary violent offences.

The inclusion in its definition of the phrase &quot;or threat&quot; mirrors the common law, as it was codified with respect to written words, in 27 Geo. 2. c. 15 (1754) and again in 4 Geo. 4. c. 54 (1823).

==Proscribed groups==
As in previous Terrorism Acts, such as the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, the Home Secretary had the power to maintain a list of &quot;proscribed groups&quot; that they believe are &quot;concerned in terrorism&quot;. The act of being a member of, or supporting such a group, or wearing an item of clothing such as &quot;to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation&quot; is sufficient to be prosecuted for a terrorist offence.

Under the act aliases of organizations can be added. For example, Al Muhajiroun, Islam4UK, Call to Submission, Islamic Path, London School of Sharia and Muslims Against Crusades were added in January 2010 and November 2011 as alternative names for Al Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect (also deemed to be the same organization) and in June 2014 Need4Khilafah, the Shariah Project and the Islamic Dawah Association were added to this list. An alias does not have to be added to the list for prosecution to be possible, provided it can be demonstrated that for all intents and purposes the organization is a proscribed one, and that the person involved has committed a proscribed act.

===List of proscribed international terrorist groups===
 the following 80 organisations appeared in Schedule 2 of the Act, to which they have been added periodically since March 2001 by statutory instruments, and are listed under the above heading in the Home Office document &#x27;Proscribed Terrorist Organisations:
===List of proscribed groups linked to Northern Ireland-related terrorism===
The following 14 organisations have appeared in Schedule 2 of the Act since it came into force and are listed under the above heading in the Home Office document &#x27;Proscribed Terrorist Organisations&#x27; under the collective description &quot;organisations in Northern Ireland that were proscribed under previous legislation&quot;. They are armed paramilitary groups proscribed because of involvement in the Troubles;

* Continuity Army Council (CAC)
* , a name claimed by multiple groups
* Irish National Liberation Army (INLA)
* Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation (IPLO)
* Irish Republican Army (IRA), a name claimed by multiple groups
* Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)
* Orange Volunteers
* Red Hand Commando
* Red Hand Defenders
* Ulster Defence Association (UDA)
* &quot;Ulster Freedom Fighters&quot; (UFF), a cover name for UDA
* Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF)

===List of formerly proscribed groups===

* Mujaheddin e Khalq (MeK) was removed from the list in June 2008, as a result of judgements of the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission and the Court of Appeal.
* International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) was deproscribed in March 2016.
* Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin (HIG) was deproscribed in December 2017.
* Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) was deproscribed in November 2019.

==Provisions==

===Section 41 (arrest without warrant)===
Section 41 of the Act provided the police with the power to arrest and detain a person without charge for up to 48 hours if they were suspected of being a terrorist. This period of detention could be extended to up to seven days if the police can persuade a judge that it is necessary for further questioning.

This was a break from ordinary criminal law where suspects had to be charged within 24 hours of detention or be released. This period was later extended to 14 days by the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and to 28 days by the Terrorism Act 2006.

===Stop and search without suspicion===

====Section 44====
The most commonly encountered use of the Act was outlined in Section 44 which enables the police and the Home Secretary to define any area in the country as well as a time period wherein they could stop and search any vehicle or person, and seize &quot;articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism&quot;. Unlike other stop and search powers that the police can use, Section 44 does not require the police to have &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that an offence has been committed, to search an individual.

In 2009, over 100,000 searches were conducted under the powers, but none of these resulted in people being arrested for terrorism offences. 504 were arrested for other offences.

In January 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that stop-and-search powers granted under Section 44 were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. It held that the rights under Article 8 of two people stopped in 2003 outside the ExCeL convention centre in London, which at the time was hosting a military equipment exhibition, had been breached. The Court found the powers were &quot;not sufficiently circumscribed&quot; and lacked &quot;adequate legal safeguards against abuse&quot;, contrary to a 2003 High Court judgment upheld at the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords.

Pending new powers in the Protection of Freedoms Bill (see Section 47A), Theresa May made a remedial order under the Human Rights Act 1998 (the Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order 2011), which had the effect of repealing sections 44, 45, 46 and most of section 47.

====Section 47A====
As discussed above, since 18 March 2011 section 44 has been treated as repealed. It has been replaced with a new section 47A by the Terrorism Act 2000 (Remedial) Order 2011. Under the new provisions, searches can only be carried out as follows:

A senior police officer must make an authorisation in relation to a specified area or place. He can make such an authorisation only if he:
*reasonably suspects that an act of terrorism will take place, and
*considers that:
**the authorisation is necessary to prevent such an act,
**the specified area or place is no greater than is necessary to prevent such an act, and
**the duration of the authorisation is no longer than is necessary to prevent such an act.

When such an authorisation is in force, any constable in uniform can, in the specified area or place, stop:
*a vehicle, and search:
**the vehicle,
**the driver of the vehicle,
**a passenger in the vehicle, and
**anything in or on the vehicle or carried by the driver or a passenger,
*a pedestrian, and search:
**the pedestrian, and
**anything carried by the pedestrian.

But the power to search can only be used for the purpose of discovering whether there is anything which may constitute evidence that:
*the vehicle concerned is being used for the purposes of terrorism, or that
*the person concerned is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

The power conferred by such an authorisation may be exercised whether or not the constable reasonably suspects that there is such evidence. A person or vehicle searched under this power may be detained for as long as is reasonably required. A person who is searched may be required to remove their headgear, footwear, outer coat, jacket or gloves, but nothing else whilst in public. If requested, a form must be given stating that the person/vehicle was stopped.

An authorisation can be given by an Assistant Chief Constable (or if the area is in the Metropolitan Police District or the City of London, then a Commander of the Metropolitan Police/City of London Police). Authorisations can also be given by the Assistant Chief Constables of:
*the British Transport Police, in relation to railway property,
*the Ministry of Defence Police, in relation to military land, ordnance factories or dockyards, or other places where the Ministry of Defence Police have an agreement to police (some gas terminals)
*the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, in relation to nuclear power stations and associated land, and land up to 5 kilometres from such places.

If given verbally, authorisations must be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable, and in either case must be notified to the Home Office as soon as reasonably practicable. Authorisations must be confirmed by the Home Office within 48 hours of their being made, or they expire automatically. If confirmed, an authorisation can only last for up to 14 days. An authorisation can be cancelled at any time, or restricted in respect of the time it ends or the area which it covers, but it cannot be expanded. New authorisations can be made regardless of whether previous authorisations exist, or have been cancelled or have expired.

===Section 58 – Collection of information===
This section creates the offence, liable to a prison term of up to fifteen years, to collect, possess, or access, &quot;information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism&quot;.

Sections 57–58: Possession offences: Section 57 is dealing with possessing articles for the purpose of terrorist acts. Section 58 is dealing with collecting or holding information that is of a kind likely to be useful to those involved in acts of terrorism. In 2019, the Section was amended to include accessing such information online in the definition of the offence. Section 57 includes a specific intention, section 58 does not.

Bilal Zaheer Ahmad, 23, from Wolverhampton, is believed to be the first person convicted of collecting information likely to be of use to a terrorist, including the al-Qaeda publication &quot;Inspire&quot;.

===Part 7===
Part 7, comprising sections 65 to 113, contained particular provisions applying to Northern Ireland, that were to require parliamentary approval on an annual basis by means of a statutory instrument to continue in force. The part replaced previous provisions under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996.

Part 7 was succeeded by the Terrorism (Northern Ireland) Act 2006, which in turn was succeeded by the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.

====Section 75 (Trial without jury)====
Section 75 provided for bench trials instead of jury trials in Northern Ireland for scheduled offences, continuing the system of Diplock courts first established in 1973.

==Stop and search, arrest and conviction rates==
Between July and December 2007, the BBC reported that more than 14,000 people and vehicles had been stopped and searched by British Transport Police in Scotland. In 2008 the Metropolitan Police conducted 175,000 searches using Section 44, these included over 2313 children (aged 15 or under), of whom 58 were aged under 10.

Up to early 2004, around 500 people are believed to have been arrested under the Act; seven people had been charged. By October 2005 these figures had risen to 750 arrested with 22 convictions; the then current Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, said &quot;the statistics illustrate the difficulty of getting evidence to bring prosecution&quot;.

Figures released by the Home Office on 5 March 2007 show that 1,126 people were arrested under the Act between 11 September 2001 and 31 December 2006. Of the total 1,166 people arrested under the Act or during related police investigations, 221 were charged with terrorism offences, and 40 convicted.

Noted arrests under Section 58 include Abu Bakr Mansha in December 2005, and the eight suspects involved in the 2004 financial buildings plot.

==Reactions and analysis==
In his comprehensive commentary on this Act and other anti-terrorism legislation, Professor Clive Walker of the University of Leeds comments:

The Terrorism Act 2000 represents a worthwhile attempt to fulfil the role of a modern code against terrorism, though it fails to meet the desired standards in all respects. There are aspects where rights are probably breached, and its mechanisms to ensure democratic accountability and constitutionalism are even more deficient, as discussed in the section on &#x27;Scrutiny&#x27; earlier in this chapter. It is also a sobering thought, proffered by the Home Affairs Committee, that the result is that &#x27;This country has more anti-terrorist legislation on its statute books than almost any other developed democracy.&#x27; (Report on the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill 2001 (2001–02 HC 351) para.1). But at least that result initially flowed from a solemnly studied and carefully constructed legislative exercise.

The Terrorism Act 2000 is subject to annual review by the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. The Independent Reviewer&#x27;s reports are submitted to the Home Secretary, laid before Parliament and published in full.

==Alleged abuses==

The laws have been criticised for allowing excessive police powers leaving scope for abuse. There have been various cases in which the laws have been used in scenarios criticised for being unrelated to fighting terrorism. Critics allege there is systematic abuse of the act against protesters.

Many instances have been reported in the media of innocent people who have been stopped and searched under section 44 of the Act. According to Home Office guidelines, police are required to have &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that a person is acting as a terrorist. Critics of the Act claim that, in practice, police are using Section 44 emergency powers as &quot;an additional tool in their day-to-day policing kit&quot; to stop and search innocent citizens without reasonable grounds, going beyond the original intention of Parliament.

One of the issues arising from the Section 44 authorisations has been the use of the Act to detain lawful protestors or other people who are in the vicinity of demonstrations. Critics claim the Act gives police extended powers to deter or prevent peaceful protest.

Problematic use of Section 44 powers has not been restricted to political protestors; according to reports, journalists, amateur and professional photographers, trainspotters, politicians and children have been subject to stop and search under suspicion of being involved in terrorist activities while engaged in lawful acts such as photography. The taking of photographs in public spaces is permitted under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (freedom of panorama), and while the Terrorism Act does not prohibit such activity, critics have alleged misuse of the powers of the Act to prevent lawful photography. (Further restrictions on photography have, however, been introduced with the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008)

Disquiet among the police and government about Section 44 increased; in an interview on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s programme iPM, Peter Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, remarked that the Act was not clear about police and that a lack of training for police officers had led to some officers being &quot;overzealous&quot; in implementing the Act. Vernon Coaker, the Minister of State stated on 20 April 2009 that, &quot;counter-terrorism measures should only be used for counter-terrorism purposes&quot;.

In December 2009, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) issued a warning to police chiefs to stop using Section 44 powers to target photographers, whether tourists, amateurs or professionals, stating that the practice was &quot;unacceptable&quot;. As of 2011, the Section 44 powers effectively no longer exist (see above), and police must &quot;reasonably&quot; suspect an individual of involvement in terrorism before intervening.

===Incidents===

====General====

* In October 2005, Sally Cameron was held for four hours after being arrested under the act for walking on a cycle path in a controlled port area in Dundee owned by Forth Ports. While cyclists were free to pass through the port zone, she was arrested and detained because she was a pedestrian and under suspicion of being a terrorist.

*In July 2008, anti-terror police held a 12-year-old autistic boy with cerebral palsy and his parents whilst travelling on the Eurotunnel Shuttle rail service under Section 7 of the Terrorism Act. The child&#x27;s mother was taken to an interrogation room and questioned on suspicion of child trafficking and released without charge. Kent Police later apologised for the incident.
* In August 2013, while travelling home from a visit to Germany, carrying work in progress relating to classified US government documents to Glenn Greenwald in Brazil, David Miranda, 28, was detained by the Metropolitan Police Service at London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

====Section 12====

Journalist Richard Medhurst was arrested under section 12 in August 2024. His electronic devices were seized and he was ordered to surrender his passwords to allow police to gain access to the data on his devices. Medhurst refused to provide the passwords. His arrest was condemned by the National Union of Journalists and the International Federation of Journalists. Rebecca Vincent from Reporters Sans Frontières said the seizure of a journalist&#x27;s equipment during an arrest &quot;at best intimidates journalists working on sensitive topics, and at worst it compromises the protection of journalistic sources&quot;.

====Section 44====

* In September 2003, two people, Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton, intending to protest against the Defence Systems Equipment International (DSEI) show in London&#x27;s Docklands, were stopped and searched under the Act. Quinton, who is a journalist, was ordered by police to stop filming the protest. The pressure group Liberty took the case to High Court where the Judge ruled in favour of the police. Appeals to the Court of Appeal, and, in March 2006, to the House of Lords, failed. The case was then taken to the European Court of Human Rights, on the grounds of an alleged violation of Articles 5, 8, 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court ruled that the stop-and-search powers of the police constituted a violation of the right to privacy.
* Walter Wolfgang, an 82-year-old from London, was removed from the 2005 Labour Party conference for heckling Jack Straw. Wolfgang had shouted that Straw&#x27;s policy on Iraq was &quot;nonsense.&quot; When Wolfgang tried to re-enter the conference, he was stopped by police under the Terrorism Act, but was not arrested. &quot;The Terrorism Act was introduced by Tony Blair with the promise that it would be used only in the gravest of cases,&quot; James Ball complained in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2012, referencing Wolfgang&#x27;s incident.
* Over 1,000 anti-war protesters, were stopped and required to empty their pockets, on their way to RAF Fairford (used by American B-52 bombers during the Iraq conflict).
* During the 2005 G8 protests in Auchterarder, Scotland, a cricketer on his way to a match was stopped at King&#x27;s Cross station in London under Section 44 powers and questioned over his possession of a cricket bat.
* In October 2008, police stopped a 15-year-old schoolboy in south London who was taking photographs of Wimbledon railway station for his school geography project. He was questioned under suspicion of being a terrorist. His parents raised concerns that his personal data could be held on a police database for up to six years.
* In January 2009, Member of Parliament Andrew Pelling was questioned after photographing roadworks near a railway station
* In April 2009, a man in Enfield was questioned under Section 44 for photographing a police car that he considered was being driven inappropriately along a public footpath. The police claimed (incorrectly) that the act made it illegal to take photographs of police officers and vehicles.
* Trainspotters have frequently been subjected to stop and search. Between 2000 and 2009, police used powers under the Act to stop 62,584 people at railway stations.
* In November 2009, BBC photographer Jeff Overs was searched and questioned by police outside the Tate Modern art gallery for photographing the sunset over St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, under suspicion of preparing for a terrorist act. Overs lodged a formal complaint with the Metropolitan Police.
* In December 2009, renowned architectural photographer Grant Smith was searched by a group of City of London Police officers under Section 44 because he was taking photographs of Christ Church Greyfriars; although he was working on public ground, the church&#x27;s proximity to the Bank of America City of London branch caused a bank security guard to call the police.
* In June 2010, Metropolitan Police officers attempted to prevent a 15-year-old boy from photographing an Armed Forces Day parade in Romford, East London, citing &quot;antisocial behaviour&quot; and the Terrorism Act. A police misconduct hearing held in December 2011 found that the police had no legal power to prevent the teenager from taking pictures and that the police inspector involved in the incident had used abusive language in calling the boy &quot;silly&quot;, &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;. The boy was awarded compensation and given an apology.
* In October 2011, a man was challenged by security staff in the Braehead Shopping Centre in Glasgow after taking photographs of his own four-year-old daughter eating an ice cream in the centre. He was held by Strathclyde Police under the Terrorism Act and eventually released without charge.

===Schedule 7===

* Paul Golding was arrested after visiting Russia in October 2019. Paul Golding refused to provide PIN codes to his phone and laptop at Heathrow Airport and so he was arrested at the airport and convicted in February 2020 with a Conditional Discharge for 9 months and ordered to pay £21 in Victim surcharge and £750 in costs.
* British journalist Kit Klarenberg, who works for &quot;The Grayzone&quot;, was detained at Luton airport on 17 May 2023. He was interrogated for over five hours about his reports on the British government and intelligence services, his work for &quot;The Grayzone&quot; and his opinions about the British government and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. His electronic devices, bank cards and memory cards were taken by police, who fingerprinted him, took DNA swabs, and photographed him. The National Union of Journalists expressed grave concern over his arrest.

<text>A statutory instrument (SI) is the principal form in which delegated legislation is made in Great Britain.

Statutory instruments are governed by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946. They replaced statutory rules and orders, made under the Rules Publication Act 1893, in 1948.

Most delegated legislation in Great Britain is made in the form of a statutory instrument. (In Northern Ireland, delegated legislation is organised into statutory rules, rather than statutory instruments.) The advent of devolution in 1999 resulted in many powers to make statutory instruments being transferred to the Scottish and Welsh governments, and oversight to the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Parliament. Instruments made by the Scottish Government are now classed separately as Scottish statutory instruments.

== When a statutory instrument is required ==

A statutory instrument is used when an Act of Parliament passed after 1947 confers a power to make, confirm or approve delegated legislation on:
# the King and states that it is to be exercisable by Order in Council; or
# a Minister of the Crown and states that it is to be exercisable by statutory instrument.

&quot;Minister of the Crown&quot; includes the Welsh Ministers and various Acts provide that delegated legislation, although made by another person (for example, the General Dental Council), is also to be made by statutory instrument. Often the Minister authorised to issue a statutory instrument is &quot;the Secretary of State&quot;, which the Interpretation Act 1978 defines as &quot;one of Her Majesty&#x27;s Principal Secretaries of State&quot;; this form effectively allows the Prime Minister to create new departments and define or redefine their responsibilities at will.

A statutory instrument is also used when the King in Council or a Minister exercises a power under an Act passed before 1947 which is legislative, rather than executive, in character.

Use of a statutory instrument is not required where the parent Act does not specify it. This may be the case where delegated legislation is of only limited application and therefore not of general importance. Instead, other provisions may be made for publishing the legislation. So, for example, an Order providing for the transfer of contracts from one National Health Service body to another may only be notified to the affected bodies, and by-laws made by a local council may be publicised through an announcement in local newspapers.

== Features ==

The main effect of delegated legislation being made by statutory instrument is that it is effective as soon as it is made, numbered, catalogued, printed, made available for sale and published on the Internet. This ensures that the public has easy access to the new laws.

Numbers are assigned by His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office and are sequential within the year of making. The number provides a means of citing the statutory instrument in addition to the title given by the instrument itself. So, for example, The Income Tax (Exemption of Minor Benefits) (Amendment) Regulations 2003 are numbered and may be cited as SI 2003 No. 1434 or SI 2003/1434.

In addition to the main numbering system, there are a number of subsidiary numbering systems which may indicate an instrument&#x27;s position within a particular series of instruments (in the following list &quot;n&quot; indicates the number):
* (C &quot;n&quot;): Commencement and/or Appointed Day orders which bring into force an Act or part of an Act.
* (L &quot;n&quot;): legal series: relating to fees or procedures in courts in England and Wales.
* (S &quot;n&quot;): Scottish series: instruments made by the United Kingdom Government which apply to Scotland only (these are different from Scottish statutory instruments made by the Scottish Government under its devolved powers).
* (NI &quot;n&quot;): Northern Ireland series: Orders in Council made by the United Kingdom Government under its &quot;direct rule&quot; powers (delegated legislation made by Northern Ireland Departments is made by statutory rules).
* (W &quot;n&quot;): Wales series: statutory instruments made by the Welsh Government and applying to Wales only. Welsh language versions are numbered (Cy &quot;n&quot;).

Statutory instruments will be classified by subject heading in the annual edition printed by His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office.

Printed copies of a statutory instrument will generally be on sale within a week of the date it is made.

== Parliamentary control ==

Most statutory instruments (SIs) are subject to one of two forms of control by Parliament, depending on what is specified in the parent Act. Parliament&#x27;s control is limited to approving, or rejecting, the instrument as laid before it: it cannot (except in very rare cases) amend or change it. Whether or not a statutory instrument is subject to affirmative or negative resolution procedure is dictated by the parent act.

=== Negative resolution procedure ===

The more common form of control is the negative resolution procedure. This requires that the instrument is either:
* laid before Parliament in draft, and can be made once 40 days (excluding any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued, or during which both Houses are adjourned for more than four days) have passed unless either House passes a resolution disapproving it, or
* laid before Parliament after it is made (but before it comes into force), but will be revoked if either House passes a resolution annulling it within 40 days.

A motion to annul a statutory instrument is known as a &quot;prayer&quot; and uses the following wording:

Any member of either House can put down a motion that an instrument should be annulled, although in the Commons, unless the motion is signed by a large number of Members, or is moved by the official Opposition, it is unlikely to be debated, and in the Lords such a motion is seldom actually voted upon.

If a resolution to annul an instrument is passed, it will be revoked by the King through an Order-in-Council. Between the date of the resolution to annul and the date when the Order-in-Council is made, the instrument remains law but ineffective. Anything done under the instrument whilst it was in force remains valid, and the Government is free to make a new statutory instrument.

The last occasion on which a statutory instrument was annulled was on 22 February 2000, when the House of Lords passed a motion to annul the Greater London Authority Elections Rules. The last time the House of Commons annulled a statutory instrument was in 1979 when it rejected the Paraffin (Maximum Retail Prices) (Revocation) Order 1979 (SI 1979/797).

=== Affirmative resolution procedure ===

Statutory instruments which are subject to affirmative resolution are less common, making up about 10% of the total. This is the more stringent form of parliamentary control as it requires positive approval, rather than the absence of a decision to annul. Accordingly, it is used where the delegated legislation may be more controversial.

The parent Act may require that the proposed statutory instrument be approved by both Houses of Parliament (or, in the case of an instrument which relates to financial matters, by the House of Commons only) either:
* before it is made (i.e. in draft form),
* after it is made, but before it can come into force, or
* after it is made and has come into force, but it cannot remain in force for longer than a specified period (usually 28 days, excluding periods when Parliament is dissolved, prorogued or adjourned for more than four days) unless approved within that period.

Once the instrument is laid before Parliament, the Government will move a motion in each House that the instrument be approved.

The last time a draft statutory instrument subject to affirmative procedure was not approved by the House of Commons was on 12 November 1969 when the House rejected four draft Orders relating to parliamentary constituencies.

=== Regulatory reform orders and legislative reform orders ===

The Regulatory Reform Act 2001 enables the Government to make an Order to change Acts of Parliament so as to remove burdens on business or others, so long as it can be done without removing &quot;necessary protections&quot;. Because of the extensive powers given to the Government to amend primary legislation as part of the Act, a special form of affirmative procedure has been introduced.

Firstly, the Government must produce a draft proposal and consult interested organisations. It must then lay the proposal and the results of the consultation, along with a detailed explanation, before Parliament for 60 days. Select committees of both Houses then debate the proposal and examine it against criteria including maintenance of &quot;necessary protection&quot; for those who may be affected, the adequacy of public consultation, the extent of the burden to be lifted, financial implications and compliance with European law. The Committees then report their findings to the House. The Government has to take those findings into account when deciding whether to proceed with the proposal. If it does, it then lays a draft Order before Parliament along with an explanation of any changes made, which is again considered by the Committees before finally being put to a vote of each House for approval.

One example of the use of Regulatory Reform Orders have included the Regulatory Reform (Sunday Trading) Order 2004 which repealed section 26 of the Revenue Act 1889, and so re-legalised the selling of methylated spirits on a Saturday night or a Sunday. Another example is the Regulatory Reform (Trading Stamps) Order 2005 which repealed the entirety of the Trading Stamps Act 1964.

The 2001 Act was repealed and replaced by the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, which created significantly wider powers and has been the subject of considerable concern. The powers have been described by David Howarth MP as the &quot;Abolition of Parliament Bill&quot; and by Daniel Finkelstein as the &quot;Bill to End All Bills&quot;.

=== Remedial orders under the Human Rights Act 1998 ===

The Human Rights Act 1998 created a procedure under which, if the courts find that an Act of Parliament contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, the Government can make a remedial order to correct the Act in question.

Before making a remedial order, the Government must lay a proposal before Parliament for 60 days, during which time it will be considered and reported upon by the Joint Committee of both Houses on Human Rights. After the 60 days have passed, the Government may then lay a draft Order before Parliament, following which there is another 60-day period in which the Joint Committee will make a recommendation to both Houses whether the Order should be approved.

An emergency procedure allows for remedial orders to be made immediately and debated afterwards; they must be approved within 120 days or will cease to have effect.

=== Henry VIII clauses ===
Some statutory instruments are made under provisions of Acts which allow the instrument to change the parent Act itself, or to change other primary legislation. These provisions, allowing primary legislation to be amended by secondary legislation, are known as Henry VIII clauses, or Henry VIII powers, because an early example of such a power was conferred on King Henry VIII by the Statute of Proclamations 1539. After the enactment of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (which permitted the Secretary of State to make changes using Henry VIII powers), the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Select Committee of the House of Lords issued a report concerning the use and drafting of such clauses, which its chairman remarked go &quot;right to the heart of the key constitutional question of the limits of executive power&quot;. Such clauses have often proved controversial, because they allow changes to the law without a vote in Parliament at any stage.

Lord Judge spoke strongly against such clauses when he was Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales: &quot;You can be sure that when these Henry VIII clauses are introduced they will always be said to be necessary. William Pitt warned us how to treat such a plea with disdain. &#x27;Necessity is the justification for every infringement of human liberty: it is the argument of tyrants, the creed of slaves.

The government (specifically the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy) controversially used Henry VIII powers to abolish EU rules on state aid (which had been incorporated into UK domestic law after Brexit). In 2021, the Good Law Project has challenged this move, arguing that the use of Henry VIII powers for such a purpose is constitutionally questionable.

=== Supervision by parliamentary committees ===

There are three Committees which have a general supervisory role in relation to statutory instruments.

The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments (a Committee of both Houses of Parliament) checks that an instrument is being made in accordance with the powers granted to the Minister making it. It does not consider the policy of instruments, but is concerned only with technical matters. The Joint Committee may draw the attention of both Houses to an instrument if it:
* imposes a cost on the public finances,
* requires payments of fees to a public authority,
* is made under powers which prevent it from being challenged in the courts,
* attempts to have retrospective effect (i.e. to change the law from a date before the date on which it is made) when the parent Act does not explicitly empower it to do so,
* makes an unexpected or unusual use of the powers conferred by the parent Act, or it may be &quot;ultra vires&quot; (outside the powers granted by the parent Act, and so unlawful),
* requires further explanation,
* has been published or laid before Parliament late, or
* appears to contain mistakes.

Where an instrument is required to be laid before the House of Commons only, then the Commons&#x27; Select Committee on Statutory Instruments undertakes a similar examination.

The House of Lords Committee on the Merits of Statutory Instruments considers the policy of statutory instruments and would draw the attention of the House of Lords to a statutory instrument if it:
* is politically or legally important,
* is no longer appropriate due to changes in circumstances since the parent Act was passed,
* implements European law inappropriately, or
* fails to achieve its intended purpose.

In addition, the House of Commons may refer a statutory instrument to a Standing Committee for detailed debate on the merits of the legislation if a motion to annul (in the case of an instrument subject to negative resolution) or approve (in the case of an instrument subject to affirmative resolution) is made. The Committee will report its conclusions to the House which will then vote on the motion to annul or approve (as the case may be).

=== Instruments not subject to parliamentary control ===

Most Acts of Parliament stipulate that their provisions shall not come into force until a date to be fixed by one or more Commencement Orders made by the Government, thereby giving the authorities time to make necessary preparations. Commencement Orders are laid before Parliament but are not subject to either the affirmative or negative procedure.

Many statutory instruments (indeed, the largest group after those subject to the negative resolution procedure) are not required to be laid before Parliament at all, and are therefore not subject to any parliamentary control.

== Judicial controls ==

As with all delegated legislation, because statutory instruments are made by a person exercising a power conferred by an Act of Parliament for a specified purpose, rather than by Parliament exercising its sovereign law-making powers, they can be struck down by the courts if it is concluded that they are &quot;ultra vires&quot; (literally, &quot;beyond the powers&quot; conferred by the parent Act). This would be the case if the Government attempts to use delegated legislation for a purpose not envisioned by the parent Act, or if the legislation is an unreasonable use of the power conferred by the Act, or if pre-conditions imposed by the Act (for example, consultation with certain organisations) have not been satisfied.

In 1987, the case &quot;re Woolwich Equitable Building Society&quot; led the courts to strike down SI 1986 No 482 regulation 11 which related to payments of dividends by building societies. More recently the Court of Appeal struck down SI 2014 No 2604, known as the Fast Track Rules, which relates to asylum appeals. This was held to be &quot;ultra vires&quot; Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 section 22.

* The &quot;Henry VIII clause&quot; refers to a type of clause that enables the UK government to use secondary legislation to amend primary legislation without going through the lengthy Parliamentary approval process. However, it is seen as an erosion of Parliamentary sovereignty as it allows ministers to make changes without proper scrutiny, though parliamentary scrutiny can be called upon if needed.

<text>The Charity Commission for England and Wales is a non-ministerial department of His Majesty&#x27;s Government that regulates registered charities in England and Wales and maintains the Central Register of Charities. Its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland are the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator and the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland.

Orlando Fraser succeeded interim chair, Ian Karet, who succeeded Baroness Stowell of Beeston.

The commission has four sites in London, Taunton, Liverpool and Newport. Its website lists the latest annual reports submitted by charities in England and Wales.

During the financial year 20222023, the Commission regulated £88billion of charity income and £85billion of charity spend.

== Charity status ==

=== Definition ===
To establish a charity, an organisation must first find at least three trustees who will be responsible for the general control and management of the administration of the charity. The organisation needs to have a charitable purpose that helps the public. Afterwards, the administration must select an official name and decide on a structure for the charity that will impact aspects such as who runs the charity and how it is run. Subsequently, the creation of a governing document that explains how the charity is run is required. Finally, an electronic application must be completed if the charity’s income is at £5,000 per year, or it is a charitable incorporated organisation (CIO). There are different rules for creating a charity in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

=== Exempt, excepted, and other non-registered charities ===
Some charities are not subject to regulation by or registration with the Charity Commission, because they are already regulated by another body, and are known as exempt charities. Most exempt charities are listed in Schedule 3 to the Charities Act 2011, but some charities are made exempt by other acts. However exempt charities must still comply with charity law and may approach the Charity Commission for advice.

Some charities are &#x27;excepted&#x27; from charity registration. This means they do not have to register or submit annual returns, but are in all other respects subject to regulation by the Charity Commission. A charity is excepted if its income is £100,000 or less and it is in one of the following groups: churches and chapels belonging to certain Christian denominations (until 2031); charities that provide premises for some types of schools; Scout and Guide groups; charitable service funds of the armed forces; and students&#x27; unions.

=== Charities operating across other national borders within the United Kingdom ===
Registration of a charity in England and Wales does not endow that status elsewhere, thus further registration has to be made before operating in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

Charities in Scotland are regulated by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.

In Northern Ireland the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland was established in 2009 to replace earlier regulation by the Voluntary and Community Unit of the Department for Social Development, part of the Northern Ireland Executive.

===Governance===

The principles of good governance, to be followed by charities in order for them to be able to achieve and maintain charitable status, are laid down in the Charity Governance Code, published by the Charity Governance Code Steering Group. 

There are two separate codes for small and large charities. The Charity Commission is not part of the Charity Governance Code Steering Group, only an observer, to ensure impartiality. The principles covered in the code are: 

If a member of the public, or any of a charity&#x27;s trustees have serious concerns, for example, whether funds are being used for the stated purpose of the charity, or if there is a serious threat to its reputation, or they do not like how they have been approached for donations,they can submit a complaint to the Charity Commission. Depending on how serious the complaint is, the Charity Commission will either recommend specific procedural improvements, require the expulsion of unsuitable trustees, or remove the organisation&#x27;s charitable status altogether.

==Legislation==

=== Establishing law ===
The Charities Act 2006 requires the Commission to be operationally independent of ministerial influence or control. Members of the commission, including the chair, are appointed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.

=== Charity tax law ===
The Finance Act 2010 extended charitable tax benefits (for example Gift Aid) to charities within EU member states, Norway and Iceland, rather than those just inside the UK.

===Fundraising Regulator===
In 2016, following the Olive Cooke scandal, the British fundraising regulatory landscape underwent a review, leading to the establishment of the Fundraising Regulator. The Fundraising Regulator is an independent oversight body without statutory authority. It serves as the regulatory authority for charitable fundraising, responsible for defining and promoting fundraising standards. Additionally, it investigates cases, addresses public complaints related to fundraising practices, and operates a fundraising preference service. This service allows the public to control how charities contact them.

=== Regulatory action ===
The commission carries out general monitoring of charities as part of its regular casework. In serious cases of abuse and regulatory concern, the commission has powers outlined in the Charities Acts to conduct statutory investigations. Before taking the decision to open a statutory inquiry, it will take the approach set out in its Regulatory and Risk framework. The commission, therefore, began around 2007 to carry out an intermediate form of action described as regulatory compliance investigations. In 2010 it opened over 140 of these cases, compared to just three full statutory investigations. However, the legality of these actions was debatable as they lacked a statutory basis. A high-profile example was the commission&#x27;s report into The Atlantic Bridge, after which that body was dissolved in September 2011. The commission announced in October 2011, in the context of cost-cutting and a re-focussing of its activities, that it would no longer carry out regulatory compliance investigations.

In 2012, the commission refused to grant charitable status to Plymouth Brethren Christian Church, stating that it was unclear whether the body&#x27;s aims were compatible with the requirement for charities to have a public benefit. The commission stated that this was called into doubt as a result of the &quot;exclusivity&quot; of the body. The decision was discussed at a session of the Public Accounts Committee, during which MP Charlie Elphicke accused the commission of being &quot;committed to the suppression of religion&quot;. The decision was later reversed by the Commission.

Between 2022 and 2023, the commission removed 4,146 charities from the register and concluded 5,726 regulatory action cases (includes 68 statutory inquiries).

==History==

Prior to the 1840s, a body of commissioners had been established by the Statute of Charitable Uses 1601 (43 Eliz. 1. c. 4), but these proved ineffective. The Charity Commission was first established by the Charitable Trusts Act 1853. There had been several attempts at reforming charities before that which had been opposed by various interest groups including the church, the courts, the companies, and the universities. The power of the commission was strengthened by amendments to the act in 1855, 1860, and 1862.

The Charity Commission was substantially reconstituted by the Charities Act 1960 (8 &amp; 9 Eliz. 2. c. 58), which replaced the Charitable Trusts Acts (1853-1891). This introduced new duties to determine charitable status, and to maintain a public register of charities.

The commission was criticised after the Aberfan disaster in 1966 for its intransigence and decisions on what it allowed money from the disaster fund to be spent on. It sanctioned the use of £150,000 to remove remaining spoil tips from the area after the National Coal Board refused to pay for the work. It also proposed asking parents &#x27;exactly how close were you to your child?&#x27;; those found not to have been close to their children would not be compensated.

The Charities Act 2006 established its current structure and name. the commission had 288 employees and 19 agency staff in post.

The Olive Cooke case, involving a 92-year-old poppy seller who allegedly committed suicide due to overwhelming requests for donations from charities, sparked widespread public fear and media attention across England and Wales. This scandal prompted a review of the self-regulation of fundraising practices in England and Wales, as well as Scotland, subsequently leading to the introduction of self-regulatory reforms in both jurisdictions.

In 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden &quot;had instructed officials to ensure candidates for the Charity Commission chair role were &quot;tested&quot; on how they would use the watchdog&#x27;s powers to rebalance charities by &quot;refocusing&quot; them on their founding missions&quot;, in response to what he described as &quot;a worrying trend in some charities that appear to have been hijacked by a vocal minority seeking to burnish their woke credentials.&quot;

Orlando Fraser was appointed as chair of the Charity Commission by the Secretary of State on a three-year term commencing from 25 April 2022. This appointment was not without controversy, including the refusal of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee to endorse the appointment.

<doc id="179917" wikidata="Q2928793" url="?curid=179917" title="Buster Mathis">
<text>Buster Mathis (June 11, 1943 – September 6, 1995) was an American boxer who competed from 1965 to 1972. He was a top contender throughout his career, beating other top contenders including George Chuvalo and Chuck Wepner. He fought Heavyweight greats such as Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Jerry Quarry and Ron Lyle; he also notably beat Joe Frazier as an amateur to qualify for the Olympics but was later replaced due to a hand injury.

==Career==

Mathis had a successful career as an amateur heavyweight boxer. He qualified for a spot in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics but had to withdraw due to an injury. He was replaced in the tournament by Joe Frazier, who went on to win the gold medal.

Mathis turned professional in June 1965 with a second round knockout victory over Bob Maynard. He went on to win his next 22 contests as well and qualified for a shot at the New York State Athletic Commission World Heavyweight Title, which had become vacant after Muhammad Ali was stripped of the title for refusing to be drafted into the United States Army.

The title fight was held on March 4, 1968, in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden against &quot;Smoking&quot; Joe Frazier, his old rival. Frazier won by an 11th-round knockout.

Mathis continued to fight in the following years, outpointing George Chuvalo, but losing on points to Jerry Quarry - a fight Mathis was favored to win. Mathis retired after losing to Quarry in 1969, but he returned in 1971 to box Muhammad Ali for the NABF belt, losing on points over 12 rounds. Ali was later criticized for not finishing Mathis in the final rounds of the fight.

After Mathis was knocked out in just two rounds in September 1972 by Ron Lyle, he retired for good.

==Retirement==
A 1980 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article featured interviews with Mathis and many of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s other opponents. It reported Mathis worked in the trucking business after he retired from the ring. 

Mathis had various health problems in later years, including two strokes, a heart attack, and kidney failure. He died of heart failure at age 52. His son Buster Mathis Jr. became a professional boxer and fought Mike Tyson in 1995.

<text>The Strowger switch is the first commercially successful electromechanical stepping switch telephone exchange system. It was developed by the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company founded in 1891 by Almon Brown Strowger. Because of its operational characteristics, it is also known as a step-by-step (SXS) switch.

== History ==
Strowger, an undertaker, was motivated to invent an automatic telephone exchange after becoming convinced that the manual telephone exchange operators were deliberately interfering with his calls, leading to loss of business. According to the local Bell Telephone Company manager Herman Ritterhoff, Strowger swore to &quot;get even&quot; with the telephone operators and &quot;put every last one of them out of a job.&quot; Ritterhoff claimed in 1913 that the real cause of Strowger&#x27;s difficulties was a metal sign hung on his wall over his telephone, causing an intermittent short circuit when blown by the wind. 

Strowger conceived his invention in 1888, and was awarded a patent for an automatic telephone exchange in 1891. The initial model was made from a round collar box and some straight pins.

While Almon Strowger devised the initial concept, he was not alone in his endeavors and sought the assistance of his brother Arnold, nephew William, and others with a knowledge of electricity and financing to realize the concept. The Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company was founded in 1891. In the original design patent, four keys were added near the telephone, one each for thousands, hundreds, tens and units, with each key having an additional wire connection to the central exchange. Each key had to be tapped the correct number of times to step the switch and make the desired connection. To connect to number 1256, the user would press the first key once, the second key twice, the third key five times and the final key six times.

The company installed and opened the first commercial exchange in his then-home town of La Porte, Indiana on November 3, 1892. The exchange had around 75 subscribers. The installation followed the original patented design, with four keys and four additional line wires connected to the exchange, but not all of the keys were used.

Early advertising called the new invention the &quot;girl-less, cuss-less, out-of-order-less, wait-less telephone&quot;.

In 1896 the company patented the finger-wheel dial as an improvement to the existing four-key design. 

The Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company became the Automatic Electric Company, which Strowger was involved in founding, although Strowger himself seems not to have been involved in further developments. The Strowger patents were exclusively licensed to the Automatic Electric Company. Strowger sold his patents in 1896 for US and sold his share in Automatic Electric in 1898 for . His patents subsequently sold for in 1916. Company engineers continued development of the Strowger designs and submitted several patents in the names of its employees.

The Strowger system was widely used until the development of the more reliable crossbar switch, an electromechanical switch with a matrix of vertical and horizontal bars and simpler motions.

== Patent details ==

Strowger&#x27;s patent specifies dialing equipment at the customer location and the switching equipment at the central office.

The telegraph keys or telephone dial creates trains of on-off current pulses corresponding to the digits 1–9, and 0 (which sends 10 pulses). This equipment originally consisted of two telegraph keys engaged by knife switches, and evolved into the rotary dial telephone.

The central office switching equipment has a two-motion stepping switch. A contact arm is moved up to select one of ten rows of contacts, and then rotated clockwise to select one of ten contacts in that row, a total of 100 choices. The stepping motion is controlled by the current pulses coming from the originating customer&#x27;s telegraph keys, and later from the rotary dial.

=== Two-motion mechanism ===
The Strowger switch has three banks of contacts. Toward the upper end of each shaft are two ratchets. The upper one has ten grooves, and raises the shaft. The lower one has long vertical teeth (on the other side, hidden).

The Strowger switch uses two telegraph-type keys on a telephone set for dialing. Each key requires a separate wire to the exchange. The keys are tapped to step the switch in two stages. The first set of incoming pulses raises the armature of an electromagnet to move a shaft which selects the desired level of contacts, by engaging a pawl with the upper ratchet. Another pawl, pivoting on the frame, holds the shaft at that height as it rotates. The second set of pulses, from the second key, operates another electromagnet. Its pawl engages the (hidden) vertical teeth in the lower ratchet to rotate the shaft to the required position. It is kept there against spring tension by a pawl pivoted on the frame. When the switch returns to its home position, typically when a call is complete, a release magnet disengages the pawls that hold the shaft in position. An interlock ensures that the spring on the shaft rotates it to angular home position before it drops to its home position by gravity.

== Development ==
The commercial version of the Strowger switch, as developed by the Strowger Automatic Telephone Exchange Company, used a rotary dial for signalling to the exchange. The original final selector (connector) switch which connected to 100 customers was supplemented by preceding group selector stages, as the &quot;cascading&quot; enabled connection to many more customers, and to customers at other exchanges. Another requirement for commercial systems was a circuit to detect a busy connection (line) and return a busy signal to the calling subscriber.

Instead of dedicating an expensive first-stage selector switch to each customer as in the first exchange, the customer was given access to the first-stage switch of a telephone network, often by a line-finder which searches &quot;backward&quot; for the calling line; so requiring only a few relays (in most cases two, a Line, and a Cut-off relay), for the equipment required for each customer line.

Later Strowger (SXS) exchanges often use a subscriber uniselector as part of the line equipment individual to each line, which searches &quot;forward&quot; for a first selector. This is more economical for higher calling-rate domestic or business customers, and has the advantage that access to additional switches can readily be added if the traffic increases (the number of linefinders serving a group is limited by the wiring multiple installed). Hence exchanges with subscriber uniselectors were usually used at British exchanges with a high proportion of business customers, e.g. director exchanges, or in New Zealand where the provision of local free calling meant that residential customers had a relatively high calling rate.

The fundamental modularity of the system combined with its step-by-step (hence the alternative name) selection process and an almost unlimited potential for expansion gives the Strowger system its technical advantage. Previous systems had all been designed for a fixed number of subscribers to be switched directly to each other in a mesh arrangement. This became quadratically more complex as each new customer was added, as each new customer needed a switch to connect to every other customer. In modern terminology, the previous systems were not &quot;scalable&quot;.
== British deployment ==
From 1912, the British General Post Office, which also operated the British telephone system, installed several automatic telephone exchanges from several vendors in trials at Darlington on 10 October 1914 and Dudley on 9 September 1916 (rotary system), Fleetwood (relay exchange from Sweden), Grimsby (Siemens), Hereford (Lorimer) and Leeds (Strowger). The GPO selected the Strowger switches for small and medium-sized cities and towns. The selection of switching systems for London and other large cities was not decided until the 1920s, when the Director telephone system was adopted. The Director systems used SXS switches for destination routing and number translation facilities similar to the register used in common-control exchanges. Using similar equipment as in the rest of the network was deemed beneficial and the equipment could be manufactured in Britain.

<text>A solenoid () is a type of electromagnet formed by a helical coil of wire whose length is substantially greater than its diameter, which generates a controlled magnetic field. The coil can produce a uniform magnetic field in a volume of space when an electric current is passed through it.

André-Marie Ampère coined the term &quot;solenoid&quot; in 1823, having conceived of the device in 1820. The French term originally created by Ampère is &quot;solénoïde&quot;, which is a French transliteration of the Greek word &quot;&quot; which means &quot;tubular&quot;.

The helical coil of a solenoid does not necessarily need to revolve around a straight-line axis; for example, William Sturgeon&#x27;s electromagnet of 1824 consisted of a solenoid bent into a horseshoe shape (similarly to an arc spring).

Solenoids provide magnetic focusing of electrons in vacuums, notably in television camera tubes such as vidicons and image orthicons. Electrons take helical paths within the magnetic field. These solenoids, focus coils, surround nearly the whole length of the tube.

== Physics ==

=== Infinite continuous solenoid ===
An infinite solenoid has infinite length but finite diameter. &quot;Continuous&quot; means that the solenoid is not formed by discrete finite-width coils but by many infinitely thin coils with no space between them; in this abstraction, the solenoid is often viewed as a cylindrical sheet of conductive material.

The magnetic field inside an infinitely long solenoid is homogeneous and its strength neither depends on the distance from the axis nor on the solenoid&#x27;s cross-sectional area.

This is a derivation of the magnetic flux density around a solenoid that is long enough so that fringe effects can be ignored. In Figure 1, we immediately know that the flux density vector points in the positive &quot;z&quot; direction inside the solenoid, and in the negative &quot;z&quot; direction outside the solenoid. We confirm this by applying the right hand grip rule for the field around a wire. If we wrap our right hand around a wire with the thumb pointing in the direction of the current, the curl of the fingers shows how the field behaves. Since we are dealing with a long solenoid, all of the components of the magnetic field not pointing upwards cancel out by symmetry. Outside, a similar cancellation occurs, and the field is only pointing downwards.

Now consider the imaginary loop &quot;c&quot; that is located inside the solenoid. By Ampère&#x27;s law, we know that the line integral of B (the magnetic flux density vector) around this loop is zero, since it encloses no electrical currents (it can be also assumed that the circuital electric field passing through the loop is constant under such conditions: a constant or constantly changing current through the solenoid). We have shown above that the field is pointing upwards inside the solenoid, so the horizontal portions of loop &quot;c&quot; do not contribute anything to the integral. Thus the integral of the up side 1 is equal to the integral of the down side 2. Since we can arbitrarily change the dimensions of the loop and get the same result, the only physical explanation is that the integrands are actually equal, that is, the magnetic field inside the solenoid is radially uniform. Note, though, that nothing prohibits it from varying longitudinally, which in fact, it does.

A similar argument can be applied to the loop &quot;a&quot; to conclude that the field outside the solenoid is radially uniform or constant. This last result, which holds strictly true only near the center of the solenoid where the field lines are parallel to its length, is important as it shows that the flux density outside is practically zero since the radii of the field outside the solenoid will tend to infinity. An intuitive argument can also be used to show that the flux density outside the solenoid is actually zero. Magnetic field lines only exist as loops, they cannot diverge from or converge to a point like electric field lines can (see Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism). The magnetic field lines follow the longitudinal path of the solenoid inside, so they must go in the opposite direction outside of the solenoid so that the lines can form loops. However, the volume outside the solenoid is much greater than the volume inside, so the density of magnetic field lines outside is greatly reduced. Now recall that the field outside is constant. In order for the total number of field lines to be conserved, the field outside must go to zero as the solenoid gets longer. Of course, if the solenoid is constructed as a wire spiral (as often done in practice), then it emanates an outside field the same way as a single wire, due to the current flowing overall down the length of the solenoid.

Applying Ampère&#x27;s circuital law to the solenoid (see figure on the right) gives us

:formula_1
where formula_2 is the magnetic flux density, formula_3 is the length of the solenoid, formula_4 is the magnetic constant, formula_5 the number of turns, and formula_6 the current. From this we get
:formula_7

This equation is valid for a solenoid in free space, which means the permeability of the magnetic path is the same as permeability of free space, μ0.

If the solenoid is immersed in a material with relative permeability μr, then the field is increased by that amount:
:formula_8

In most solenoids, the solenoid is not immersed in a higher permeability material, but rather some portion of the space around the solenoid has the higher permeability material and some is just air (which behaves much like free space). In that scenario, the full effect of the high permeability material is not seen, but there will be an effective (or apparent) permeability &quot;μ&quot;eff such that 1 ≤ &quot;μ&quot;eff ≤ &quot;μ&quot;r.

The inclusion of a ferromagnetic core, such as iron, increases the magnitude of the magnetic flux density in the solenoid and raises the effective permeability of the magnetic path. This is expressed by the formula
:formula_9
where &quot;μ&quot;eff is the effective or apparent permeability of the core. The effective permeability is a function of the geometric properties of the core and its relative permeability. The terms relative permeability (a property of just the material) and effective permeability (a property of the whole structure) are often confused; they can differ by many orders of magnitude.

For an open magnetic structure, the relationship between the effective permeability and relative permeability is given as follows:
:formula_10
where &quot;k&quot; is the demagnetization factor of the core.

=== Finite continuous solenoid ===
A finite solenoid is a solenoid with finite length. Continuous means that the solenoid is not formed by discrete coils but by a sheet of conductive material. We assume the current is uniformly distributed on the surface of the solenoid, with a surface current density &quot;K&quot;; in cylindrical coordinates:
formula_11

The magnetic field can be found using the vector potential, which for a finite solenoid with radius &quot;R&quot; and length &quot;l&quot; in cylindrical coordinates formula_12 is
formula_13

Where:

* formula_14,
* formula_15,
* formula_16,
* formula_17,
* formula_18 ,
* formula_19 .

Here, formula_20, formula_21, and formula_22 are complete elliptic integrals of the first, second, and third kind.

Using:

formula_23

The magnetic flux density is obtained as
formula_24
formula_25

On the symmetry axis, the radial component vanishes, and the axial field component is
formula_26
Inside the solenoid, far away from the ends (formula_27), this tends towards the constant value formula_28.

=== Short solenoid estimate ===
For the case in which the radius is much larger than the length of the solenoid (formula_29), the magnetic flux density through the centre of the solenoid (in the &quot;z&quot; direction, parallel to the solenoid&#x27;s length, where the coil is centered at &quot;z&quot;=0) can be estimated as the flux density of a single circular conductor loop:
:formula_30

=== Irregular solenoids ===
Within the category of finite solenoids, there are those that are sparsely wound with a single pitch, those that are sparsely wound with varying pitches (varied-pitch solenoid), and those with varying radii for different loops (non-cylindrical solenoids). They are called &quot;irregular solenoids&quot;. They have found applications in different areas, such as sparsely wound solenoids for wireless power transfer, varied-pitch solenoids for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and non-cylindrical solenoids for other medical devices.

The calculation of the intrinsic inductance and capacitance cannot be done using those for the conventional solenoids, i.e. the tightly wound ones. New calculation methods were proposed for the calculation of intrinsic inductance(codes available at ) and capacitance. (codes available at )

=== Inductance ===
As shown above, the magnetic flux density formula_2 within the coil is practically constant and given by
:formula_32
where &quot;μ&quot;0 is the magnetic constant, formula_5 the number of turns, formula_6 the current and formula_3 the length of the coil. Ignoring end effects, the total magnetic flux through the coil is obtained by multiplying the flux density formula_2 by the cross-section area formula_37:
:formula_38

Combining this with the definition of inductance
:formula_39
the inductance of a solenoid follows as
:formula_40

A table of inductance for short solenoids of various diameter to length ratios has been calculated by Dellinger, Whittmore, and Ould.

This, and the inductance of more complicated shapes, can be derived from Maxwell&#x27;s equations. For rigid air-core coils, inductance is a function of coil geometry and number of turns, and is independent of current.

Similar analysis applies to a solenoid with a magnetic core, but only if the length of the coil is much greater than the product of the relative permeability of the magnetic core and the diameter. That limits the simple analysis to low-permeability cores, or extremely long thin solenoids. The presence of a core can be taken into account in the above equations by replacing the magnetic constant &quot;μ0&quot; with &quot;μ&quot; or &quot;μ0μr&quot;, where &quot;μ&quot; represents permeability and &quot;μr&quot; relative permeability. Note that since the permeability of ferromagnetic materials changes with applied magnetic flux, the inductance of a coil with a ferromagnetic core will generally vary with current.

==History==

===Name and origins===
The original name of the city was Gladbach, by which it is still often known today. To distinguish it from another town of the same name (the present Bergisch Gladbach), it took the name München-Gladbach (“Monks’ Gladbach”, in reference to the abbey) in 1888. Between 1933 and 1950, it was written München Gladbach (short: M. Gladbach), without a hyphen. This spelling was seen as potentially misleading, as it could imply that Gladbach was a borough of Munich (&quot;München&quot; in German), so consequently the name was changed to Mönchen-Gladbach in 1950 (and subsequently Mönchengladbach in 1960) to avoid confusion.

The town was founded around Gladbach Abbey in 974. It was named after the Gladbach, a narrow brook which mostly runs underground today. The abbey and adjoining villages became a town in the 14th century. The town of Rheydt is located nearby and is incorporated into Mönchengladbach today.

===Early history===
The first settlements in the area of Mönchengladbach are approximately 300,000–400,000 years old and show remains of Homo erectus and Neanderthal. There are numerous cairns from the Neolithic and Bronze Ages.

The history of Mönchengladbach began with the construction of the Gladbach Minster and the founding of an abbey in the year 974 by Gero, Archbishop of Cologne, and his companion, the monk Sandrad of Trier.

To improve the settlement, the monks created a market north of the church in the 12th century. Craftsmen settled near the market. Gladbach received its town charter in 1364–1366. The &quot;town&quot; erected a town wall made of stone, which had to be maintained by the citizens. Remains of the wall can be found at the Geroweiher, as can remains of the &quot;Thick Tower&quot;, an old fortified tower at the Waldhausener hill. Until the end of the 18th century, the city belonged to the department of Grevenbroich within the duchy of Jülich.

On 4 October 1794, the armed forces of the French Revolution marched into the town, one day before the fortress Jülich had been handed over. When the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II ceded the left bank of the river Rhine to France with the Treaty of Lunéville in 1801, Gladbach fell under French laws suppressing religion. This was the end for the abbey, and the monastery was closed. On 31 October 1802, the last 31 monks left the monastery. The contents of the tremendous abbey library, well known outside Germany, were scattered or destroyed.

From 1798 until 1814, the &quot;Mairie&quot; Gladbach was part of &quot;Canton&quot; Odenkirchen, of the &quot;Arrondissement&quot; Krefeld, of the Roer &quot;Département&quot;.

===Recent history===
In 1815, Gladbach became part of the Kingdom of Prussia and seat of the Landkreis Gladbach, which was dissolved in 1929. In 1815 Gladbach became seat of the Bürgermeisterei (Office of mayor), which was split in 1859 into two parts: the City of Gladbach and Office of Mayor Obergeburth. The latter was renamed to München-Gladbach-Land in 1907.

From 1933 through 1975, the neighborhood of Rheydt was an independent city; the split from München-Gladbach was arranged by Joseph Goebbels, who was born locally. After reuniting with Mönchengladbach, the central station (Rheydt Hauptbahnhof) kept its original name, making Mönchengladbach the only city in Germany to have two rail stations each called Hauptbahnhof.

In response to the 10 May 1940 German invasion of Belgium, Mönchengladbach was bombed by RAF Bomber Command on the evening of 11 May. The bomber crews were attempting to interdict German troop movements on roads, intersections and rail lines in the area, especially the city&#x27;s railyards. About half of the approximately 36 twin-engine Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers reportedly hit their targets, and three were shot down. Four people were killed on the ground, including a British woman living in Germany.

Eventually, the Prussian Rhine Province was dissolved after World War II, and the city became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia which was formed in 1946.

==Climate==

==Economy==

Mönchengladbach&#x27;s industrial ascent was mainly influenced by the development of the textile industry from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. In addition, a textile-oriented machine industry also developed.

After the Second World War, a major structural change began, reducing the importance of the textile industry and attracting new economic sectors. At present, only 7 percent of employees work in the once dominant textile and clothing industry (for example: &quot;Van Laack&quot; and &quot;gardeur&quot;).

As part of the successful diversification of the business location, local government and representatives founded the Mönchengladbach Business Development Corporation (WFMG) in 1997. WFMG and the University of Applied Sciences Niederrhein have developed a five-pillar model for the future orientation of the business location. Thereafter textile and fashion, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering, logistics, the creative industry and the health sector are the leading sectors for the economic future of the city of Mönchengladbach. As part of an active cluster policy, the WFMG has partly initiated its own networks for these industries.

The most important employer in Mönchengladbach is the Santander Consumer Bank, which has its headquarters at Aachener Straße in Mönchengladbach&#x27;s city center.

The economic structure includes: tool and spinning machines (Dörries Scharmann, Monforts, Trützschler, Schlafhorst), automatic conveyor systems, signal and system technology (Scheidt &amp; Bachmann), transformers (SMS Meer), cables (Nexans Germany formerly Kabelwerk Rheydt), printed matter and foodstuffs.

Chocolatier Heinemann is known beyond the city limits for his cakes, pralines and baked goods, which he offers in cafés on site as well as in Düsseldorf and Munich. Furthermore, beer breweries are represented in Mönchengladbach. The Oettinger brewery produces at the site of the former Hannen brewery. The Hensen brewery has been producing a lower Rhine-type Altbier since 2015 at the former spring of the river Gladbach in the Waldhausen district.

Especially in the 1970s and 1980s nightlife was attractive to young party people from Düsseldorf. In the meantime, tourism in particular is playing a certain role. Mönchengladbach has about 40 hotels (for example: Hotel Burgund) and inns as well as a youth hostel in the district Hardter Wald. In total there are about 2000 beds. The number of overnight stays is over 200,000 annually.

Mönchengladbach Airport is dominated by general aviation. There are currently no scheduled services to and from Mönchengladbach. Additionally, there are few business-charter passenger flights. In June 2015 &quot;Hugo Junkers Hangar&quot; was opened as an aviation and event facility. Airplane enthusiasts can book sightseeing flights with Junkers Ju 52 from the 1940s. The next major international airport Düsseldorf Airport is only 20 kilometres (12 mi) away to the east.

==Politics==
===Mayor===
The current mayor of Mönchengladbach is Felix Heinrichs of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, with a runoff held on 27 September, and the results were as follows:

Line 8 of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn connects the city to Düsseldorf and Hagen; an extension further westwards is being discussed. A number of regional trains serve Mönchengladbach, including regional line RE13 to the city of Venlo which is located in the Netherlands. By the end of 2009 it was the largest city in Germany without regular long-distance services. With the new schedule for 2010, Mönchengladbach got an InterCity/Intercity-Express connection twice a week.

The city also has a commercial airport called Düsseldorf Mönchengladbach.

Local bus and rail transport is carried out by the NEW-AG under the VRR transport association regulations.

==Sports==
===Football===
Mönchengladbach has a long football tradition. Its home club, Borussia Mönchengladbach, is one of the country&#x27;s most well-known, best-supported, and successful teams. The club plays on the Borussia-Park stadium with a capacity of 54,057. The club has the sixth largest fan club in Germany, &quot;The Foals&quot; (&quot;Die Fohlen&quot;), with more than 50,000 active members.

===Field hockey===
The city hosted three International Field Hockey world championships: the 2006 Men&#x27;s World Hockey Cup, the 2008 Women&#x27;s Hockey Champions Trophy, and the 2010 Men&#x27;s Hockey Champions Trophy.

===Harness racing===
Since 1892, Mönchengladbach has owned a harness racing track called &quot;Trabrennbahn Mönchengladbach&quot; (Trotting track Mönchengladbach).

<doc id="179924" wikidata="Q201717" url="?curid=179924" title="Helix">
<text>A helix (; ) is a shape like a cylindrical coil spring or the thread of a machine screw. It is a type of smooth space curve with tangent lines at a constant angle to a fixed axis. Helices are important in biology, as the DNA molecule is formed as two intertwined helices, and many proteins have helical substructures, known as alpha helices. The word &quot;helix&quot; comes from the Greek word , &quot;twisted, curved&quot;. 
A &quot;filled-in&quot; helix – for example, a &quot;spiral&quot; (helical) ramp – is a surface called a &quot;helicoid&quot;.

==Properties and types==

The pitch of a helix is the height of one complete helix turn, measured parallel to the axis of the helix.

A double helix consists of two (typically congruent) helices with the same axis, differing by a translation along the axis.

A circular helix (i.e. one with constant radius) has constant band curvature and constant torsion. The slope of a circular helix is commonly defined as the ratio of the circumference of the circular cylinder that it spirals around, and its pitch (the height of one complete helix turn).

A &quot;conic helix&quot;, also known as a &quot;conic spiral&quot;, may be defined as a spiral on a conic surface, with the distance to the apex an exponential function of the angle indicating direction from the axis.

A curve is called a general helix or cylindrical helix if its tangent makes a constant angle with a fixed line in space. A curve is a general helix if and only if the ratio of curvature to torsion is constant.

A curve is called a slant helix if its principal normal makes a constant angle with a fixed line in space. It can be constructed by applying a transformation to the moving frame of a general helix.

For more general helix-like space curves can be found, see space spiral; e.g., spherical spiral.

===Handedness===
Helices can be either right-handed or left-handed. With the line of sight along the helix&#x27;s axis, if a clockwise screwing motion moves the helix away from the observer, then it is called a right-handed helix; if towards the observer, then it is a left-handed helix. Handedness (or chirality) is a property of the helix, not of the perspective: a right-handed helix cannot be turned to look like a left-handed one unless it is viewed in a mirror, and vice versa.

==Mathematical description==

In mathematics, a helix is a curve in 3-dimensional space. The following parametrisation in Cartesian coordinates defines a particular helix; perhaps the simplest equations for one is

: formula_1

As the parameter increases, the point formula_2 traces a right-handed helix of pitch (or slope 1) and radius 1 about the -axis, in a right-handed coordinate system.

In cylindrical coordinates , the same helix is parametrised by:
: formula_3

A circular helix of radius and slope (or pitch ) is described by the following parametrisation:

: formula_4

Another way of mathematically constructing a helix is to plot the complex-valued function as a function of the real number (see Euler&#x27;s formula).
The value of and the real and imaginary parts of the function value give this plot three real dimensions.

Except for rotations, translations, and changes of scale, all right-handed helices are equivalent to the helix defined above. The equivalent left-handed helix can be constructed in a number of ways, the simplest being to negate any one of the , or components.

===Arc length, curvature and torsion===

A circular helix of radius formula_5 and slope (or pitch ) expressed in Cartesian coordinates as the parametric equation
:formula_6
has an arc length of
:formula_7
a curvature of
:formula_8
and a torsion of
:formula_9

A helix has constant non-zero curvature and torsion.

A helix is the vector-valued function

formula_10

So a helix can be reparameterized as a function of , which must be unit-speed:

formula_11

The unit tangent vector is

formula_12

The normal vector is

formula_13

Its curvature is

formula_14.

The unit normal vector is

formula_15

The binormal vector is

formula_16

Its torsion is
formula_17

==Examples==
An example of a double helix in molecular biology is the nucleic acid double helix.

An example of a conic helix is the Corkscrew roller coaster at Cedar Point amusement park.

Some curves found in nature consist of multiple helices of different handedness joined together by transitions known as tendril perversions.

Most hardware screw threads are right-handed helices. The alpha helix in biology as well as the A and B forms of DNA are also right-handed helices. The Z form of DNA is left-handed.

In music, pitch space is often modeled with helices or double helices, most often extending out of a circle such as the circle of fifths, so as to represent octave equivalency.

In aviation, &quot;geometric pitch&quot; is the distance an element of an airplane propeller would advance in one revolution if it were moving along a helix having an angle equal to that between the chord of the element and a plane perpendicular to the propeller axis; see also: pitch angle (aviation).

<doc id="179926" wikidata="Q1639938" url="?curid=179926" title="Jimmy Young (boxer)">
<text>Jimmy Young (November 14, 1948 – February 20, 2005) was an American heavyweight professional boxer. Young was known for his awkward, defensive style and counterpunching. He was one of the top contenders of the 1970s, losing a controversial unanimous decision against Muhammad Ali in 1976 and earning a victory over George Foreman in 1977. Young fought many other significant fighters of his era, including twice outpointing Ron Lyle and losing only by a split decision to then-number one contender Ken Norton in a title eliminator in late 1977. Fellow boxer Bobby Watts was his cousin.

==Early life==
==Career==

===Early fights===
An inexperienced Young was matched against contender Earnie Shavers in what was only his 11th professional fight. Shavers, who at that time had a 42–2 record dealt Young his first knockout loss, being his 4th loss. Young had tried trading blows and was caught early on by one of the division&#x27;s hardest punchers, who was well known for his overwhelming early attacks.

After this defeat Young went undefeated for the next three years, including a win over contender Ron Lyle and a controversial draw in a re-match with Earnie Shavers with many observers scoring the bout for Young. The improved outcome for Young was largely due to improvements made to his defense since his last fight with the devastating hitter. Despite Young&#x27;s inability to earn a victory over Shavers, it was enough to earn him a title fight with the heavyweight champion, Muhammad Ali.

===The Ali–Young fight===
Young achieved widespread public recognition when he fought Muhammad Ali at the Capital Center in Landover, Maryland, on April 30, 1976, for the world heavyweight title, although boxing circles had already noted his ability. Ali weighed in at 230 pounds, the highest for any of his fights up to that point (he would weigh 236.25 pounds in his fight against Trevor Berbick), and was consequently slow and immobile throughout the bout. Seven years younger and 21 pounds lighter, Young adopted a strategy of fighting aggressively from a distance, landing numerous light blows while dodging and parrying Ali&#x27;s counterpunches, and using his body blows, which had little power behind them but were effective at scoring points. At close quarters, Young would turn passive. In addition to retreating whenever possible, Young often kept his head ducked very low in order to deter Ali from landing blows at his head and risk censure from the referee for &quot;rabbit punching&quot;. On several occasions when Ali was inside and Young had his back to the ropes, Young intentionally put his head or upper body out of the ring beyond the ropes to compel the referee to step in and separate the fighters. As a novel boxing tactic this divided opinion between its being a way of neutralizing Ali&#x27;s game, to its being seen as an unsportsmanlike way of causing tactical stoppages every time Ali possessed an advantage. At one point during the bout the referee did initiate a count due to Young&#x27;s being outside the ropes. The fight went the full 15 rounds resulting in a controversial one-sided unanimous decision in favor of Ali. Referee Tom Kelly scored it 72–65; judges Larry Barrett and Terry Moore had it 70–68 and 71–64, respectively.

Ken Norton, (a rival of Ali) who was commentating at ringside, had the fight even on his own scorecard. Former &quot;Ring&quot; editor Lester Bromberg called the decision a &quot;travesty&quot;. New York &quot;Daily News&quot; reporter Dick Young said: &quot;[Ali won] by the grace of three hero-worshipping fight officials. I believe many people, the voting officials among them, refuse to believe what they see when one of their super-heroes doesn&#x27;t function as expected.&quot; After the match&#x27;s televised broadcast, many viewers called to the network to complain about the decision, and Ali&#x27;s career trainer Angelo Dundee went on record as saying this was Ali&#x27;s &quot;worst fight&quot;. After the match there were calls on Ali to retire from the sport from quarters of the sport&#x27;s media.

===Rematch with Lyle and then George Foreman===
Young defeated Lyle in a November 1976 rematch by using clever defense and a fast offensive style. He was able to dominate the older fighter, with one judge&#x27;s scorecard having Young winning 11 of 12 rounds.

In March 1977, Young then fought George Foreman in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Foreman was on a five bout win streak since losing the title to Muhammad Ali in &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot;, earning victories over top contenders Ron Lyle and Joe Frazier.

The Young–Foreman fight was somewhat steady until the sixth round. The early rounds were punctuated by complaints from Young and his corner about the use of elbows by Foreman, who was punished by the referee with a point deduction. For the first half of the fight, Young used his somewhat unorthodox boxing skills and good defense to keep out of harm&#x27;s way, while using his punching speed to counter. In the sixth round he became somewhat more aggressive himself and landed a number of clean punches on Foreman. Eleven seconds into the seventh round, Foreman caught Young with a left-handed body punch, and immediately followed with a powerful swinging left hand to the head. Young reeled and turned away and seemed about to go down, while Foreman tried to pursue his advantage, but somehow Young survived to the end of the round. In his after-match comments on TV, he described it as &quot;desperation&quot;. After the near knockdown Young rallied, and landed a number of good punches of his own. As the fight progressed Foreman&#x27;s eyes became puffy and his punches lost their menace. For the rest of the contest, Foreman continued to move forward, trying to cut off the ring and looking for the big knock out, while taking punches from the elusive Young. In the final round Young managed a knockdown over Foreman, and earned a unanimous win by 12-round decision. &quot;The Ring&quot; named the Young–Foreman bout its 1977 &quot;Fight of the Year&quot;. Young joined Ali as one of only two men to beat Foreman before his first retirement in 1977.

===The Young–Norton eliminator fight===
Now the number two contender, Young&#x27;s next fight was a mandatory world title eliminator against Ken Norton, the number 1 contender. Young had won five straight since his loss to Ali.

Young lost the Norton match that occurred in November 1977 at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a controversial split decision. Many observers watching in attendance felt Young should have been declared the winner. While Young boxed cleverly, drawing Norton onto sneak right hand punches, Norton himself pressed forward dangerously, always his best style. The two had sparred when Norton trained for his second Ali match. Norton had found shots thrown first to the head rarely landed so he used a heavy two-handed attack pounding away to the ribs, then lobbing powerful head shots. The fight was set at 15 rounds. Although this was unusual for a non-title match, the format was adopted due to the bout&#x27;s importance as an eliminator. Due to the importance of the fight, which was later retro-designated as a WBC title match, a large crowd gathered to watch the bout including then world champion Muhammad Ali. Although the winner of the fight was supposed to go on to fight for the heavyweight championship, Leon Spinks, who had won the championship from Muhammad Ali in an upset win on February 15, 1978, chose a rematch against Ali instead of fighting Norton for the WBC title. As a result, Norton was awarded the WBC championship belt

===Later career===
Demoralised at having lost another close decision, Young went into a gradual downward spiral. In June 1978 poor conditioning, an increasing problem, led to Young being outpointed by prospect Ossie Ocasio. While better in a direct rematch, in January 1979, Ocasio again earned the win and went on to fight the world champion Larry Holmes.

Young won a short three-round brutal battle with unranked Wendell Bailey, showing flashes of old form. But in other matches of note Young fared poorly. He was stopped due to cuts by new heavyweight contender Gerry Cooney after four rounds in a fight where he was dominated. He also lost on points to another rising prospect and future heavyweight champion Michael Dokes. In the 1979 match with Dokes, Young was out of shape due to lack of training and weighed 229 lbs., nearly the heaviest he had weighed throughout his career and around 15 lbs. heavier than his ideal fighting weight.
However Young was able to slim down for his fight against British champion John L. Gardner, occurring in December 1979. Young outpointed Gardner, knocking him down in the 10th round. The triumph over Gardner as well as wins against Marvin Stinson and Jeff Sims were probably his last notable wins.

Starting in 1981 Young appeared to be making a comeback, winning five in a row, including a TKO over previously unbeaten Gordon Racette. In 1982 however, Young&#x27;s comeback was cut short when he was defeated on points by future champion Greg Page. He became a &quot;trial horse&quot; for emerging contenders, dropping decisions to more future champions in Tony Tucker and Tony Tubbs. He continued fighting with mixed results until 1988, when he retired at the age of 39.

==Later life==
After his boxing career, Young had financial, drug, and legal problems. During a court hearing on a drug possession charge, his Philadelphia public defender argued that Young had symptoms of chronic traumatic brain injury due to his time in the ring. At a boxing celebrity event, &quot;The Ring&quot; noted that Young apparently needed to be helped about by his family. He was reported as being afflicted with dementia pugilistica in his last years.

==Death==
Young died at Hahnemann University Hospital, Philadelphia, at the age of 56 from a heart attack on February 20, 2005. He was interred at Mount Peace Cemetery in Philadelphia.

<text>Sir Leslie Ronald Young , known professionally as Jimmy Young (21 September 1921 – 7 November 2016), was an English singer, disc jockey and radio personality. Early in his career in the 1950s he had two number ones, &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; and &quot;The Man from Laramie&quot;, both in 1955, and several other top ten hits in the UK chart, but he became better known for his long-running show on BBC Radio 2, The JY Prog, which ran from 1973 until 2002.

==Early life==
Young was born in Cinderford, Gloucestershire. The son of a baker and a dressmaker, he attended East Dean Grammar School. Young nearly died from bronchitis, double pneumonia and pleurisy as a child. He excelled at boxing and rugby, playing for Cinderford RFC and later turning down a place with Wigan&#x27;s rugby league team.

After his parents divorced in 1939, he left for South Wales to work as an electrician. Young later joined the RAF, becoming a PT instructor, staying until 1949.

==Singing career==
Young signed to the new Polygon Records in 1950, joining Petula Clark, Louis Prima and Dorothy Squires. All his recordings on the label were conducted by Ron Goodwin. Goodwin later said he always liked working with Young &quot;because he was always so enthusiastic. He thought everything we did was going to be a hit.&quot; The most popular was &quot;Too Young&quot; which he recorded in 1951, but this was before the days of UK record charts which didn&#x27;t start until November 1952, so the record books do not list it. The song was a big sheet music seller at the time and was a cover version of the Nat King Cole original. There were also two duets with Petula Clark that year, &quot;Mariandl&quot; (b/w &quot;Broken Heart&quot;).

In 1952, he signed a recording contract with Decca. Young enjoyed Top 10 successes with &quot;Eternally&quot;, &quot;Chain Gang&quot; and &quot;More&quot; (with which he surpassed Perry Como&#x27;s American original in the British Singles Chart listings). His most successful year as a recording artist was 1955, when &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; (from the film &quot;Unchained&quot;) and &quot;The Man from Laramie&quot; (from the film of the same name) were both number one hits. He returned to the UK Top 20 after a lengthy absence in 1963 with &quot;Miss You&quot; and continued to release singles until the late 1960s. However, after the success of Elvis Presley, he became anxious, depressed and increasingly dependent on sleeping pills. In February 1960, he started to have thoughts of suicide, and one friend told him to see an astrologer, Katina Theodossiou. Young said later, that &quot;She said I was going to be a great success...there is absolutely no way with your chart you can commit suicide. In actual fact you&#x27;re going to be around so long they&#x27;re going to have to take you off the field and shoot you&quot;. Young later credited her with saving his career. Young said &quot;She forecast that my future lay in interviewing people, not singing&quot;.

==Disc jockey and radio broadcaster==
After a period with Radio Luxembourg, Young joined the BBC. He became a host of &quot;Housewives&#x27; Choice&quot;, on the BBC Light Programme, and later he became one of the first disc jockeys on BBC Radio 1, presenting the weekday mid-morning show from 1967 to 1973. He then joined BBC Radio 2 in 1973, where he presented a daily lunchtime news and current affairs programme. The show (which he referred to as &quot;The JY Prog&quot;), ran from 2 July 1973 to 20 December 2002.

He developed a popular approach to current affairs and regularly interviewed Margaret Thatcher while she was Prime Minister. He broadcast from around the world, including several live shows from Moscow, the first in 1977, and interviewed every British Prime Minister from 1964 to 2010. His theme music was &quot;Town Talk&quot; by Ken Woodman &amp; His Piccadilly Brass. BFN (&#x27;Bye for now&#x27;) was one of his catchphrases.

Although he was offered the opportunity to present a weekend current affairs programme, he turned it down. His radio slot was taken over by the former &quot;Newsnight&quot; presenter, Jeremy Vine. Shortly after leaving and retiring from the BBC, Young wrote a newspaper column criticising his former employer for instances of &quot;brutality&quot;, and making clear that it had not been his idea to leave. He declined lunch with his successor and the pair never met.
He continued to write a weekly column for the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; newspaper until he retired from this role in November 2014. He did present a Christmas Day show in 2003 on BBC Radio Gloucestershire. On the same day he also appeared on &#x27;Loose Ends&#x27; on BBC Radio 4.

Young returned to BBC Radio 2 in 2011 with a special one-hour programme in celebration of his 90th birthday. &quot;Sir Jimmy Young at 90&quot;, broadcast on 20 September 2011, heard him in conversation with his friend and former sparring partner Ken Bruce, looking back over his career. In March 2012 Young returned to presenting on Radio 2 after over nine years when he joined Desmond Carrington on a weekly show entitled &quot;Icons of the &#x27;50s&quot;. His final radio appearance was in February 2016 when he gave a brief tribute to his former colleague Sir Terry Wogan on Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Jeremy Vine Show&quot;, the programme that replaced Young&#x27;s in 2003.

==Awards==
Young was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1979, and promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993. In the 2002 New Year Honours, he was knighted for services to radio broadcasting.

==Autobiography==
His first autobiography, &quot;J.Y.: The Autobiography of Jimmy Young&quot;, was published by W.H. Allen in 1974. His second autobiography, &quot;Forever Young: The Autobiography&quot;, was published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 2003. In addition he wrote a book in 1982 simply entitled &#x27;Jimmy Young&#x27; that concentrated on his broadcasting career.

==Death==
According to a family spokesman, Young died &quot;peacefully at home&quot; in the afternoon of 7 November 2016, aged 95, with his wife Alicia by his side.

<text>Robert Lawrence Welch Jr. (August 31, 1945 – June 7, 2012) was an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter who was a member of Fleetwood Mac from 1971 to 1974. He had a successful solo career in the late 1970s. His singles included &quot;Hot Love, Cold World&quot;, &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot;, &quot;Precious Love&quot;, &quot;Hypnotized&quot;, and his signature song, &quot;Sentimental Lady&quot;.

==Early life==
Welch was born in Hollywood, California, into a show business family. His father, Robert L. Welch Sr., was a producer and screenwriter at Paramount Pictures, producing films starring Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Welch Sr. produced the 25th Annual Academy Awards TV special in 1953 and &quot;The Thin Man&quot; TV series from 1958 to 1959. Bob&#x27;s mother, Templeton Fox, was a singer and actress who worked with Orson Welles&#x27; Mercury Theatre in Chicago and appeared in TV and movies from 1962 to 1979.

Welch learned clarinet in his childhood, switching to guitar in his early teens. His interests were jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock music. He was accepted into Georgetown University, but instead moved to Paris, planning to attend the Sorbonne. Welch told &quot;People&quot; in a 1979 interview that, in Paris, &quot;I mostly smoked hash with bearded guys five years older&quot; and spent most of his time &quot;sitting in the Deux Magots café&quot;. He returned to Southern California, where he briefly studied French at the University of California, Los Angeles but did not complete a degree.

In 1964, Welch joined the Los Angeles-based vocal group The Seven Souls. The Seven Souls lost a battle of the bands competition, the prize being a contract with Epic Records, to Sly and the Family Stone. The Seven Souls&#x27; 1967 single &quot;I&#x27;m No Stranger&quot; made no impact at the time of its release, despite subsequent issue in France and Italy. Its B-side, &quot;I Still Love You&quot;, has since become a Northern Soul anthem, with original copies selling up to £400. The Seven Souls broke up in 1969.

Welch subsequently returned to Paris and started a trio, Head West, which was not a success. He later told &quot;People&quot; that his time in Paris (1969-1971) was &quot;living on rice and beans and sleeping on the floor.&quot;

==Fleetwood Mac==
In 1971, Welch auditioned for Fleetwood Mac at Benifold, their retreat and communal home in England. The band had recently lost one of its front-line members, guitarist Jeremy Spencer, and were looking for a replacement. Judy Wong, a friend and part-time secretary for the band, recommended her high school friend Welch. The band had a few meetings with Welch and decided to hire him, despite not having previously played with him, after listening to some of his songs on tape. Welch was assigned rhythm guitar, backing up lead guitarist Danny Kirwan. Welch also moved in to Benifold, in Hampshire.

The band&#x27;s first album to feature Christine McVie and Welch, &quot;Future Games&quot;, was recorded at Advision Studios in London and released in September 1971, with the title track written by Welch. Six months later, in 1972, the band released &quot;Bare Trees&quot;, which was mostly recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in Wembley, London, and featured Welch&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Lady&quot;. This song was a big hit for Welch five years later when he re-recorded it for his solo album &quot;French Kiss.&quot; Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham also sang on and produced the remake.

===Line-up changes===
The band recorded their next two albums &quot;Penguin&quot; and &quot;Mystery to Me&quot; at Benifold using mobile equipment hired from The Rolling Stones. Throughout this period, Fleetwood Mac often changed band members around the core of Mick Fleetwood, the McVies and Welch. Kirwan was replaced as a vocalist by ex-Savoy Brown lead singer Dave Walker, and as a lead guitarist by Bob Weston. Both Walker and Weston played on &quot;Penguin&quot;. Released in January 1973, the album reached No. 49 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart in the United States. This album contained Welch&#x27;s songs &quot;Bright Fire&quot;, &quot;Night Watch&quot;, and &quot;Revelation&quot;.

&quot;Mystery to Me&quot; contained Welch&#x27;s song &quot;Hypnotized&quot;, which earned significant FM radio airplay in the United States. However, as a result of an aborted tour, &quot;Mystery to Me&quot; only reached No. 67 in the States.

===&#x27;Fake Mac&#x27; and Relocation to LA===
By late 1973, internal stresses caused by a shifting line-up, touring, the deterioration of the McVies&#x27; marriage and an affair between Weston and Fleetwood&#x27;s wife, Jenny Boyd, were debilitating to the band. Weston was sacked and the band quit a tour of the US.

The band&#x27;s manager, Clifford Davis, refused to cancel the remaining 26 dates of the tour, fearing that this would destroy his reputation with bookers and promoters. In a letter to the remaining Fleetwood Mac members, he said he &quot;had not slaved for years to be brought down by the whims of irresponsible musicians&quot;. He claimed that he owned the Fleetwood Mac name, and informed them of his plan to make the band into a new &quot;star-quality, headlining act&quot;—in effect firing them, but offering them jobs in the new band. Welch and the other band members did not take this seriously and ignored Davis&#x27;s offer. Davis then set up a US tour with a new group of musicians—without Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s consent—who were to be billed as &quot;The New Fleetwood Mac&quot;. None of the new musicians had ever played with any previous incarnation of the band. Davis announced that Welch and John McVie had quit Fleetwood Mac, and that Fleetwood and Christine McVie would be joining the &#x27;new&#x27; band at a later date. The original members of Fleetwood Mac obtained an injunction preventing the &quot;fake Mac&quot; from touring under their name, while Davis obtained an injunction preventing the original band from touring. The lawsuits resulting from the ultimately aborted tour put Fleetwood Mac out of commission for almost a year.

During this limbo, Welch stayed in Los Angeles and connected with entertainment attorneys. Welch believed the band was being neglected by Warner Bros.—the parent of their label, Reprise Records—and convinced the band to move to Los Angeles. 

Instead of getting another manager, Fleetwood Mac decided to manage themselves. After the courts ruled that the &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; name belonged to Fleetwood and John McVie, the two band members set up their own band management company, Seedy Management.

===&quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot; and departure from Fleetwood Mac===
In 1974, Welch was the only guitar player in the band. Warner Bros. made a new deal with Fleetwood Mac, releasing the album &quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot; on Reprise in September 1974. The album became the band&#x27;s first to reach the Top 40 in the United States, peaking at No. 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The subsequent tour would be Welch&#x27;s last with Fleetwood Mac.

Welch was suffering with personal and professional issues: his marriage was failing, and he felt he had exhausted his creativity with the band. Later, he explained that he felt estranged from John and Christine McVie, yet close to Fleetwood, with whom, he asserted, he was running the band in 1974. Welch resigned from Fleetwood Mac in December 1974 and was replaced by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.

Of the Fleetwood Mac albums on which Welch appeared, American album sales totaled 500,000 units shipped between 1971 and 2000 for &quot;Future Games&quot;; 1 million units of &quot;Bare Trees&quot; between 1972 and 1988; and 500,000 units of &quot;Mystery to Me&quot; between 1973 and 1976, when it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Welch&#x27;s relationship with his former band remained amicable in the years following his departure. During the height of their respective popularity in the late 1970s, Welch would frequently open for Fleetwood Mac and he would sit in as lead vocalist on &quot;Hypnotized&quot;. Mick Fleetwood managed Welch&#x27;s career into the 1980s.

===Lawsuit===

By the 1990s, Welch&#x27;s once diplomatic relationship with Fleetwood Mac had become acrimonious. In 1994, Welch sued Fleetwood, the McVies, band attorney Michael Shapiro and Warner Bros. Records for breach of contract related to underpayment of royalties. Previously, in 1978, Welch and the band had signed a contract with Warner Bros. agreeing to an equal share of all royalties from their Fleetwood Mac albums. Welch alleged that the members later made new deals with Warner Bros. for higher royalty rates, and neither Fleetwood nor the McVies had informed Welch, thus cheating him out of equal royalties. The lawsuit was settled in 1996.

===Hall of Fame controversy and reconciliation===
When Fleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, original band members Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie were named to the Hall, as were later additions Danny Kirwan, Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks. Welch, who anchored the band for several years and five albums, was not. Welch felt the recent legal battle with the band soured the committee to include him. &quot;My era was the bridge era,&quot; Welch told the Cleveland newspaper the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; in 1998. &quot;It was a transition. But it was an important period in the history of the band. Mick Fleetwood dedicated a whole chapter of his biography to my era of the band and credited me with &#x27;saving Fleetwood Mac&#x27;. Now they want to write me out of the history of the group. It hurts... Mick and I co-managed the group for years. I&#x27;m the one who brought the band to Los Angeles from England, which put them in the position of hooking up with Lindsey and Stevie. I saw the band through a whole period where they barely survived, literally.&quot;

In a 2003 online question-and-answer session on the Fleetwood Mac fan site The Penguin, Welch revised his opinion about the exclusion. He had recently visited Fleetwood Mac backstage after a show, and he reconnected with Mick Fleetwood. Welch no longer blamed the band for his exclusion. He instead blamed the Hall&#x27;s committee and its industry insiders (such as Ahmet Ertegun and Jann Wenner), stating they did not like his style of music. He still maintained that the lawsuit was a factor, as it prevented him from contacting Mick Fleetwood, and they were still estranged at the time of the induction.

==Rock trio and solo career==
In 1975, Welch formed the short-lived hard rock power trio Paris with ex-Jethro Tull bassist Glenn Cornick and former Nazz drummer Thom Mooney. With a guitar-driven aesthetic compared by retrospective critics to Led Zeppelin, Paris released two commercially unsuccessful albums: &quot;Paris&quot; and &quot;Big Towne, 2061&quot;. Hunt Sales later replaced Mooney until the group disbanded.

In a 1979 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Welch said that the two Paris albums were &quot;ill-conceived.&quot; The band&#x27;s overhead and ensuing lack of commercial success drained Welch&#x27;s finances, leaving him with only $8,000 in savings (equivalent to ~$35,000 in 2024) after its dissolution.

In September 1977, Welch released his first solo album, &quot;French Kiss,&quot; a mainstream pop collection featuring contributions from Fleetwood, Buckingham, and Christine McVie. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA, peaking at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart in 1978. It yielded three hit singles: a revamped version of &quot;Sentimental Lady&quot; produced by Buckingham and McVie (#8), &quot;Ebony Eyes&quot; (#14; featuring Juice Newton on backing vocals) and &quot;Hot Love, Cold World&quot; (#31).

Welch followed up &quot;French Kiss&quot; with two albums in 1979. In February, &quot;Three Hearts&quot;, an album that replicated the rock/disco fusion of &quot;French Kiss&quot;, peaked at No. 20 (earning a RIAA gold certification) and spawned the hit &quot;Precious Love&quot; (#19), while the follow-up single &quot;Church&quot; (#73) also charted as his final U.S. Top 100 hit. His second effort that year, November&#x27;s &quot;The Other One&quot;, contained his first solo recordings without any Fleetwood Mac members. Although the album reached No. 105 on the charts, none of its singles charted. Notable songs include &quot;Rebel Rouser&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Fall&quot;. From 1980 to 1981, he hosted &quot;Hollywood Heartbeat&quot;, an early music video program. His subsequent solo albums into the early 1980s (&quot;Man Overboard,&quot; &quot;Bob Welch,&quot; and &quot;Eye Contact&quot;) were not successful; released approximately two years after &quot;Church&quot;, &quot;Bob Welch&quot; only charted at No. 201.

In 1999, Welch released an experimental jazz/loop-based album, &quot;Bob Welch Looks at Bop&quot;. He followed this up in 2003 with &quot;His Fleetwood Mac Years and Beyond&quot;, which contained re-recordings of songs he originally performed with Fleetwood Mac, as well as some solo hits. In 2006, he released &quot;His Fleetwood Mac Years and Beyond 2&quot;, which mixed a half-dozen new compositions, along with a similar number of his Mac/solo remakes. He released more CDs with Fuel Records in 2008, 2010, and 2011.

Welch appeared as an avatar named BobWelch Magic in 2008, performing solo acoustic favorites and hits live for 30 minutes, in a show with Von Johin (musician/publisher Mike Lawson) and Cypress Rosewood (musician Tony Gerber) in the virtual world of Second Life, streaming live into the Gibson Island virtual stage from Lawson&#x27;s studio.

== Recovery and second marriage ==
Following the release of &quot;Eye Contact&quot; (which failed to chart), Welch took to partying with Guns N&#x27; Roses, who were rehearsing in his garage. He became addicted to cocaine and heroin, and was hospitalized for detox in spring of 1985. Welch reflected on that era as &quot;being a very bad boy, very decadent, very cynical, VERY stoned. It was not a good time.&quot;

The day he was released from detox, he was introduced to Wendy Armistead by Taryn Power (Tyrone Power&#x27;s daughter) and Tony Sales at The Central (now The Viper Room). Welch and Armistead were married in December 1985 and moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to maintain Welch&#x27;s sobriety. Welch abstained from all illegal drugs for the rest of his life.

While in Phoenix, they formed a short-lived group called Avenue M. The group went on tour and recorded one song for a greatest hits compilation. Welch and Armistead later moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and remained married until his death.

==Death and legacy==
Three months before his death, Welch underwent spinal surgery. The procedure was unsuccessful and doctors told him his condition would not improve.

On June 7, 2012, around 6:00 a.m., Welch died by suicide, shooting himself in his Nashville home where his wife Wendy — for whom he left a nine-page suicide note and love letter — discovered his body. He was 66 years old.

Wendy died on November 28, 2016, from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart disease, also aged 66. Bob and Wendy Welch are buried beside each other in Memphis, Tennessee.

An exhibit chronicling Bob Welch&#x27;s career opened at The Musicians Hall of Fame at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee on August 27, 2018. Despite the lawsuit over a decade earlier, Fleetwood wrote a tribute for the exhibit. Bob and Wendy Welch&#x27;s estate has endowed a scholarship to support Belmont School of Music students.

== Pop culture ==
Bob Welch is mentioned throughout episode one of season eighteen of &quot;Family Guy&quot; called &quot;Yacht Rocky.&quot; The main character, Peter Griffin, finds out that Bob Welch has passed away and takes a moment to lie down and stare at the ceiling while listening to &quot;Sentimental Lady.&quot; This repeats several times in the episode as different characters lament Bob&#x27;s passing.

<doc id="179937" wikidata="Q2568271" url="?curid=179937" title="Harvey Fletcher">
<text>Harvey Fletcher (September 11, 1884 – July 23, 1981) was an American physicist. Known as the &quot;father of stereophonic sound&quot;, he is credited with the invention of the 2-A audiometer and an early electronic hearing aid. He was an investigator into the nature of speech and hearing, and made contributions in acoustics, electrical engineering, speech, medicine, music, atomic physics, sound pictures, and education. Following his death, he was credited with collaborating with his doctoral advisor, Robert Millikan, on the Nobel-prize winning oil drop experiment which first determined the charge of the electron.

==Early years==
Fletcher was born in Provo, Utah. He graduated from Brigham Young High School in 1904. He enrolled at Brigham Young University (BYU), graduating in 1907 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He married Lorena Chipman. They were the parents of seven children. Harvey Fletcher was the father of James C. Fletcher, former president of the University of Utah and NASA Administrator and of Harvey J. Fletcher, a BYU math professor.

==Graduate work==
In 1911, Fletcher was the first physics student to earn a PhD &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from the University of Chicago. His dissertation research was on methods to determine the charge of an electron. This included the oil drop experiment commonly attributed to his advisor and collaborator, Robert Andrews Millikan. Millikan took sole credit, in return for Fletcher claiming full authorship on a related result for his dissertation. Fletcher&#x27;s contributions were detail-oriented but still contributed to the successful experiment, in which he incorporated, among other things, experience with projection lanterns. Millikan went on to win the 1923 Nobel Prize for Physics, in part for this work, and Fletcher kept the agreement a secret until his death.

After completing his doctorate, he returned to BYU, where he became the head of the physics department. He served in this capacity from 1911 until 1916. Fletcher left BYU to work at Western Electric, establishing himself as a researcher. He co-founded the Acoustical Society of America (ASA) in 1931. He joined the Bell Telephone Laboratories&#x27; Engineering Staff Research Department where he found great interest in the physics of sound (acoustical science). He worked there from 1933 to 1949, when he became a professor of electrical engineering at Columbia University from 1949 to 1952. He returned to BYU in 1952 to be the director of research. He served in that role as well as being the first dean of the new college of physics and engineering sciences until 1958.

==Notable contributions==
Fletcher&#x27;s contributions to speech perception are among his best-known work. He showed that speech features are usually spread over a wide frequency range, and developed the &quot;articulation index&quot; to approximately quantify the quality of a speech channel. He also developed the concepts of equal-loudness contours (commonly known as Fletcher–Munson curves), loudness scaling and summation, and the critical band.

At Bell Labs, he oversaw research in electrical sound recording, including the first successful stereophonic recordings, the first live stereo sound transmission, and the production of the first vinyl recording. All of this was done with the help of the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Leopold Stokowski, between 1931 and 1932. Some of his other accomplishments include the production of the first functional hearing aid, the 2-A audiometer, and the artificial larynx. At Bell Labs, he worked with and was reportedly a tremendous influence on Harold Burris-Meyer, who developed advances in psychoacoustics.

Much of his research is considered to be authoritative, and his books, &quot;Speech and Hearing&quot; and &quot;Speech and Hearing in Communication&quot;, are notable treatises on the subject.

==Honors==
Fletcher was elected an honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America in 1949, the second person to receive this honor after Thomas Edison, 20 years earlier. He was president of the American Society for Hard of Hearing, an honorary member of the American Otological Society and an honorary member of the Audio Engineering Society. In 1924 he was awarded the Louis E. Levy Medal by the Franklin Institute for physical measurements of audition. He was president of the American Physical Society. He was the first president of Acoustical Society of America (1929–31). In 1937 he was elected vice-president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was also a member of the National Hearing Division Committee of Medical Sciences. He was given the Progress Medal Award by the American Academy of Motion Pictures, in Hollywood. For eight years he acted as National Councilor for the Ohio State University Research Foundation.

In 2010, Fletcher was honored by BYU as the founding dean of its College of Engineering (now the Ira A. Fulton College of Engineering).

On April 23, 2016, Fletcher was awarded a posthumous technical Grammy Award for his research and inventions related to stereophonic sound.

==Personal life==
Fletcher was a devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

He died on July 23, 1981, after a stroke.

<text>Oberhausen (, ) is a city on the river Emscher in the Ruhr Area, Germany, located between Duisburg and Essen ( ). The city hosts the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen and its Gasometer Oberhausen is an anchor point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.

==History==
Oberhausen was named for its 1847 railway station which had taken its name from the Oberhausen Castle. The new borough was formed in 1862 following inflow of people for the local coal mines and steel mills. Awarded town rights in 1874, Oberhausen absorbed several neighbouring boroughs including Alstaden, parts of Styrum and Dümpten in 1910. Oberhausen became a city in 1901, and they incorporated the towns of Sterkrade and Osterfeld in 1929. The Ruhrchemie AG synthetic oil plant (&quot;Oberhausen-Holten&quot; or &quot;Sterkrade/Holten&quot;) was a bombing target of the oil campaign of World War II, and the US forces reached the plant by 4 April 1945.

In 1973, Thyssen AG employed 14,000 people in Oberhausen in the steel industry, but ten years later the number had fallen to 6,000.

In 1954 the city began hosting the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, and the 1982 Deutscher Filmpreis was awarded to a group that wrote the Oberhausen Manifesto.

==Demographics==
Population development since 1862:

The age breakdown of the population (2013) is:
There were 12.5% non-Germans living in Oberhausen, as of 2014.

The unemployment rate is 10.4% (Jul 2020).

Migrant communities in Oberhausen as of 31 December 2017:

<text>Roger Kynard &quot;Roky&quot; Erickson (July 15, 1947 – May 31, 2019) was an American musician and singer-songwriter. He was a founding member and the leader of the 13th Floor Elevators and a pioneer of the psychedelic rock genre in the 1960s, as well as horror rock in the 1970s and 80s.

==Biography==
Erickson was born in Dallas, Texas to Roger and Evelyn Erickson, and had four younger brothers. The nickname &quot;Roky&quot;, a contraction of his first and middle names, was given to him by his parents. His father, an architect and civil engineer, was stern and disapproving of Erickson&#x27;s countercultural attitudes, once forcibly cutting his son&#x27;s hair rather than allow him to grow it out Beatles-style. His mother was an amateur artist and opera singer, and encouraged Erickson&#x27;s musical talent by taking guitar lessons herself so she could teach him.

Erickson was interested in music from his youth, playing piano from age five and taking up guitar at 10. He attended school in Austin and dropped out of Travis High School in 1965, one month before graduating, rather than cut his hair to conform to the school dress code. 
Erickson wrote his first songs, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; and &quot;We Sell Soul&quot;, at age 15, and started a band with neighborhood friends which evolved into his first notable group, the Spades. The Spades scored a regional hit with &quot;We Sell Soul&quot;; the song is included as an unlisted bonus track on Erickson&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;All That May Do My Rhyme&quot; and was adapted as &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall Down&quot; by the 13th Floor Elevators for their debut album. In 1967, Erickson was a guest on a few songs on labelmate Red Krayola&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Parable of Arable Land&quot;, playing electric organ on &quot;Hurricane Fighter Plane&quot; and harmonica on &quot;Transparent Radiation&quot;.

===The 13th Floor Elevators===

In late 1965, at age 18, Erickson co-founded the 13th Floor Elevators. He and bandmate Tommy Hall were the main songwriters. Early in her career, singer Janis Joplin considered joining the Elevators, but Family Dog&#x27;s Chet Helms persuaded her to go to San Francisco instead, where she found major fame.

The band released their debut album &quot;The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators&quot; in 1966. It contained the band&#x27;s only charting single, Erickson&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot;. A stinging breakup song, the single was a major hit on local charts in the U.S. southwest and appeared at lower positions on national singles charts as well. Critic Mark Deming writes that &quot;If Roky Erickson had vanished from the face of the earth after The 13th Floor Elevators released their epochal debut single, &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot;, in early 1966, in all likelihood he&#x27;d still be regarded as a legend among garage rock fanatics for his primal vocal wailing and feral harmonica work.&quot;

In 1967, the band followed up with &quot;Easter Everywhere&quot;, perhaps the band&#x27;s most focused effort, featuring &quot;Slip Inside This House&quot;, and a noted cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;. The album &quot;Live&quot; was released in 1968 by the band&#x27;s record label International Artists, with little to no input from the band. It featured audience applause dubbed over studio recordings of cover versions, alternate takes, and older material.

&quot;Bull of the Woods&quot; (1969) was the 13th Floor Elevators&#x27; final album on which they worked as a group and was largely the work of Stacy Sutherland. Erickson—due to health and legal problems—and Tommy Hall were only involved with a few tracks, including &quot;Livin&#x27; On&quot; and &quot;May the Circle Remain Unbroken&quot;.

===Mental illness and legal problems===
In 1968, while performing at HemisFair, Erickson began speaking gibberish. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and sent to a Houston psychiatric hospital, where he involuntarily received electroconvulsive therapy.

The Elevators were vocal proponents of marijuana and psychedelic drug use, and were subject to extra attention from law enforcement agencies. In 1969, Erickson was arrested for possession of a single marijuana joint in Austin. Facing a potential ten-year incarceration, Erickson pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid prison. He was first sent to the Austin State Hospital. After several escapes, he was sent to the Rusk State Hospital in Rusk, Texas, where he was subjected to more electroconvulsive therapy and Thorazine treatments, ultimately remaining in custody until 1972. During his time at Rusk, he continued writing songs and poetry. Family and friends managed to smuggle some of these poems, and in 1972, self-published the book &quot;Openers&quot;, intending to use the proceeds to hire a lawyer. (Various sources claim approximately 1,000 copies of &quot;Openers&quot; were printed; how many copies were actually sold remains unknown.) Six tracks from the 1999 Erickson collection &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; were also recorded during his time at Rusk.

===Alien years===
In 1974, after having been released from the state hospital, Erickson formed a new band which he called &quot;Bleib Alien&quot;, &quot;Bleib&quot; being an anagram of Bible and/or German for &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Alien&quot; being a pun on the German word &quot;allein&quot; (&quot;alone&quot;) – the phrase in German, therefore, being &quot;remain alone&quot;. His new band exchanged the psychedelic sounds of The 13th Floor Elevators for a more hard rock sound that featured lyrics on old horror film and science fiction themes. &quot;Two Headed Dog (Red Temple Prayer)&quot; (produced by The Sir Douglas Quintet&#x27;s Doug Sahm and inspired by Vladimir Demikhov&#x27;s 1950s head transplant experiments) was released as a single.

The new band was renamed Roky Erickson and the Aliens. In 1979, after playing with the Reversible Cords on May Day at Raul&#x27;s, Erickson recorded 15 new songs with producer Stu Cook, former bass player of Creedence Clearwater Revival. These efforts were released in two &quot;overlapping&quot; LPs – &quot;Roky Erickson and the Aliens&quot; (CBS UK, 1980) and &quot;The Evil One&quot; (415 Records, 1981). Cook played bass on two tracks, &quot;Sputnik&quot; and &quot;Bloody Hammer&quot;. 

=== Creative decline and renewed interest ===
Roky performed with The Nervebreakers as his backup band at The Palladium in Dallas in July 1979. A recording was issued on the French label New Rose and was recently re-issued elsewhere. The Austin-based band the Explosives served as Roky&#x27;s most frequent back-up band during the early Raul&#x27;s era, between 1978 and the early 1980s. Billed as Roky Erickson and the Explosives, they were regulars at Raul&#x27;s, the Continental Club, and other Austin venues. It was this incarnation that contributed two live tracks to the first &quot;Live at Raul&#x27;s&quot; LP, released in 1980, with other Raul&#x27;s top bands: The Skunks, Terminal Mind, The Next, Standing Waves, and The Explosives (without Roky Erickson). The Roky Erickson tracks (&quot;Red Temple Prayer&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Shake Me Lucifer&quot;) were not included on the initial release for contractual reasons, but were included on a later release.

In 1984 an observational documentary was produced in Austin for Swedish television, titled &quot;Demon Angel: A Day and Night with Roky Erickson&quot;. It featured Erickson in plugged and unplugged performances, solo and with local musician/producer Mike Alvarez on additional guitar, in an underground creek beneath the Congress Street Bridge on Halloween. Alvarez later released the film on VHS, updating it with interviews of some of Erickson&#x27;s friends and relatives; it was toured to several cities including Pittsburgh, where the screening was followed by a set of Erickson covers by Alvarez and others, as well as a performance by the Mount McKinleys with guest vocalist Sumner Erickson (Roky&#x27;s brother). A soundtrack of the film also was issued on CD, receiving positive reviews.

Several live albums of his older material have been released since the mid-1980s, and in 1990 Sire Records/Warner Bros. Records released the tribute album &quot;Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye&quot;, produced by Bill Bentley. It featured versions of Erickson&#x27;s songs performed by The Jesus and Mary Chain, R.E.M., ZZ Top, Poi Dog Pondering, Julian Cope, Butthole Surfers, Bongwater, John Wesley Harding, Doug Sahm, and Primal Scream. According to the liner notes, the title of the album came from a remark Erickson made to a friend who asked him to define psychedelic music, to which Erickson reportedly replied &quot;It&#x27;s where the pyramid meets the eye, man&quot;, an apparent reference to the Eye of Providence, which appears on the album cover.

===Return to music and later life===


In 1995, Erickson released &quot;All That May Do My Rhyme&quot; on Butthole Surfers drummer King Coffey&#x27;s label Trance Syndicate Records. Produced by Texas Tornados bassist Speedy Sparks, Austin recording legend Stuart Sullivan, and Texas Music Office director Casey Monahan, the release coincided with the publication of &quot;Openers II&quot;, a complete collection of Erickson&#x27;s lyrics. Published by Henry Rollins&#x27;s 2.13.61 Publications, it was compiled and edited by Monahan with assistance from Rollins and Erickson&#x27;s youngest brother Sumner Erickson, a classical tuba player.

Sumner was granted legal custody of Roky in 2001, and established a legal trust to aid his brother. As a result, Roky received some of the most effective medical and legal aid of his life, the latter useful in helping sort out the complicated tangle of contracts that had reduced royalty payments to all but nothing for his recorded works. He also started taking medication to better manage his schizophrenia.

A documentary film on the life of Roky Erickson titled &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot; was made by director Keven McAlester and screened at the 2005 SXSW film festival. In September of the same year, Erickson performed his first full-length concert in 20 years at the annual Austin City Limits Music Festival with The Explosives with special guest and longtime associate Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top.

In the December 30, 2005, issue of the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;, an alternative weekly newspaper in Austin, Texas, Margaret Moser chronicled Erickson&#x27;s recovery, stating that Erickson had weaned himself off his medication, played at 11 gigs in Austin that year, obtained a driver&#x27;s license, bought a car, and voted.

In 2007, Erickson played his first ever gigs in New York City at Southpaw in Brooklyn, NY, as well as California&#x27;s Coachella Festival and made a debut performance in England to a capacity audience at the Royal Festival Hall, London. Roky continued to play in Europe, performing for the first time in Finland at Ruisrock festival. The performance was widely considered the highlight of the festival day.

On September 8, 2008, Scottish post-rock band Mogwai released the &quot;Batcat&quot; EP. Erickson is featured on &quot;Devil Rides&quot;. Erickson performed alongside Austin-based indie rock band Okkervil River at the Austin Music Awards in 2008 and then again at the 2009 South by Southwest music festival.

Erickson returned to the stage in 2008 to perform songs from the 13th Floor Elevators catalog that had not been performed in decades with fellow Austinites The Black Angels as his backing band. After months of practices and time recording in an Austin studio, they performed a show in Dallas followed by a West Coast tour. The Black Angels played a regular set and then backed Erickson as his rhythm section, playing 13th Floor Elevators songs as well as songs from Erickson&#x27;s solo albums.

On April 20, 2010, Erickson released &quot;True Love Cast Out All Evil&quot;, his first album of new material in 14 years. Okkervil River serves as Erickson&#x27;s backing band on the album.

In March 2012 Erickson toured New Zealand and Australia for the first time headlining Golden Plains Festival in Meredith, Victoria and playing sold-out side shows in Sydney and Melbourne.

On May 10, 2015, he performed with the reunited 13th Floor Elevators at Levitation (formerly Austin Psych Fest, the event was renamed &quot;Levitation&quot; after the song of the same title). The band consisted of original band members Erickson, Tommy Hall, John Ike Walton, and Ronnie Leatherman, joined by Roky&#x27;s son Jegar Erickson on harmonica, Roky&#x27;s lead guitarist Eli Southard, and rhythm guitarist Fred Mitchim. On Oct. 7, 2018, Erickson performed outdoors to an audience of thousands at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival in San Francisco.

==Death==
Erickson died in Austin on May 31, 2019. His death was made public through a Facebook post by his brother Mikel, who wrote &quot;My brother Roky passed away peaceably today. Please allow us time.&quot; No cause of death was announced.

==Legacy and influence==
Author Jonathan Lethem titled his 2007 novel &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Yet&quot; in honor of two (otherwise unconnected) songs of the same title by Erickson and The Vulgar Boatmen. Lethem called Erickson&#x27;s song &quot;irresistible&quot; and &quot;one of those incredibly versatile songs.&quot;

&quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s &quot;From Outer Space&quot;&quot; features a character named Roky Crikenson in homage to Erickson. Crikenson, like the original Roky, believes himself to be an alien abductee.

A plotline in an episode of 1990s sitcom &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot; revolved around a sighting of reclusive novelist Thomas Pynchon. Pynchon did not appear, but agreed to allow his name to be used on the condition that it was specifically mentioned that Pynchon was seen wearing a T-shirt showing a picture of Erickson. This spurred an increase in sales of Erickson&#x27;s albums.

The album &quot;It&#x27;s Spooky&quot; by Daniel Johnston and Jad Fair features the song &quot;I Met Roky Erickson&quot;, named after an encounter Johnston had with the artist.

&quot;If You Have Ghost&quot; is the first EP by Swedish rock band Ghost. It was produced by Dave Grohl and released on 20 November 2013 by Republic Records. The first track is a cover of &quot;If You Have Ghosts&quot; as tribute to Roky Erickson. Ghost also included a live version on their musical film &quot;Rite Here Rite Now&quot; in 2024.

&quot;True Love Cast Out All Evil: The Songwriting Legacy of Roky Erickson&quot; by author Brian T. Atkinson was released by Texas A&amp;M University Press in 2021. The book includes forewords by ZZ Top&#x27;s Billy Gibbons and legendary punk rock icon Henry Rollins.

<text>Jean Baptiste Joseph, chevalier Delambre (19 September 1749 – 19 August 1822) was a French mathematician, astronomer, historian of astronomy, and geodesist. He was also director of the Paris Observatory, and author of well-known books on the history of astronomy from ancient times to the 18th century.

== Biography ==

After a childhood fever, he suffered from very sensitive eyes, and believed that he would soon go blind. For fear of losing his ability to read, he devoured any book available and trained his memory. He thus immersed himself in Greek and Latin literature, acquired the ability to recall entire pages verbatim weeks after reading them, became fluent in Italian, English and German and even wrote an unpublished &quot;Règle ou méthode facile pour apprendre la langue anglaise&quot; (Easy rule or method for learning English).

Delambre&#x27;s quickly achieved success in his career in astronomy, such that in 1788, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1790, to establish a universally accepted foundation for the definition of measures, the National Constituent Assembly asked the French Academy of Sciences to introduce a new unit of length. The academics decided on the metre, defined as 1 / 10,000,000 of the distance from the North Pole to the equator, and prepared to organise an expedition to measure the length of the meridian arc between Dunkirk and Barcelona. This portion of the meridian, which also passes through Paris, was to serve as the basis for the length of the quarter meridian, connecting the North Pole with the Equator. In April 1791, the academy&#x27;s Metric Commission confided this mission to Jean-Dominique de Cassini, Adrien-Marie Legendre and Pierre Méchain. Cassini was chosen to head the northern expedition but, as a royalist, he refused to serve under the revolutionary government after the arrest of King Louis XVI on his Flight to Varennes. On 15 February 1792, Delambre was elected unanimously a member of the French Academy of Sciences and in May 1792, after Cassini&#x27;s final refusal, was placed in charge of the northern expedition, measuring the meridian from Dunkirk to Rodez in the south of France. Pierre Méchain headed the southern expedition, measuring from Barcelona to Rodez. The measurements were finished in 1798. The gathered data were presented to an international conference of savants in Paris the following year.

In 1801, First Consul Bonaparte took the presidency of the French Academy of Sciences and appointed Delambre its Permanent Secretary for the Mathematical Sciences, a post he held until his death. In 1803, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.

After Méchain&#x27;s death in 1804, he was appointed director of the Paris Observatory. He was also professor of astronomy at the Collège de France. The same year he married Elisabeth-Aglaée Leblanc de Pommard, a widow with whom he had lived already for a long time. Her son, Achille-César-Charles de Pommard (1781–1807) assisted Delambre on several occasions in his astronomical and geodetical surveys, notably the measuring of the baselines for the meridian survey, and the latitude definition for Paris in December 1799 which was presented to the Conference of Savants.

Delambre was one of the first astronomers to derive astronomical equations from analytical formulas, was the author of Delambre&#x27;s analogies and, after the age of 70, also the author of works on the history of astronomy like the &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;astronomie&quot;. He was a knight (&quot;chevalier&quot;) of the Order of Saint Michael and of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. His name is also one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel tower. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822.

Delambre died in 1822 and was interred in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. The crater Delambre on the Moon is named after him.

Delambre was an atheist.

<doc id="179947" wikidata="Q3424284" url="?curid=179947" title="Doubly special relativity">
<text>Doubly special relativity (DSR) – also called deformed special relativity or, by some, extra-special relativity – is a modified theory of special relativity in which there is not only an observer-independent maximum velocity (the speed of light), but also an observer-independent maximum energy scale (the Planck energy) and/or a minimum length scale (the Planck length). This contrasts with other Lorentz-violating theories, such as the Standard-Model Extension, where Lorentz invariance is instead broken by the presence of a preferred frame. The main motivation for this theory is that the Planck energy should be the scale where as yet unknown quantum gravity effects become important and, due to invariance of physical laws, this scale should remain fixed in all inertial frames.

==History==
First attempts to modify special relativity by introducing an observer-independent length were made by Pavlopoulos (1967), who estimated this length at about . In the context of quantum gravity, Giovanni Amelino-Camelia (2000) introduced what is now called doubly special relativity, by proposing a specific realization of preserving invariance of the Planck length . This was reformulated by Kowalski-Glikman (2001) in terms of an observer-independent Planck mass. A different model, inspired by that of Amelino-Camelia, was proposed in 2001 by João Magueijo and Lee Smolin, who also focused on the invariance of Planck energy.

It was realized that there are, indeed, three kinds of deformation of special relativity that allow one to achieve an invariance of the Planck energy; either as a maximum energy, as a maximal momentum, or both. DSR models are possibly related to loop quantum gravity in 2+1 dimensions (two space, one time), and it has been conjectured that a relation also exists in 3+1 dimensions.

The motivation for these proposals is mainly theoretical, based on the following observation: The Planck energy is expected to play a fundamental role in a theory of quantum gravity; setting the scale at which quantum gravity effects cannot be neglected and new phenomena might become important. If special relativity is to hold up exactly to this scale, different observers would observe quantum gravity effects at different scales, due to the Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction, in contradiction to the principle that all inertial observers should be able to describe phenomena by the same physical laws. This motivation has been criticized, on the grounds that the result of a Lorentz transformation does not itself constitute an observable phenomenon. DSR also suffers from several inconsistencies in formulation that have yet to be resolved. Most notably, it is difficult to recover the standard transformation behavior for macroscopic bodies, known as the soccer ball problem. The other conceptual difficulty is that DSR is &quot;a priori&quot; formulated in momentum space. There is, as of yet, no consistent formulation of the model in position space.

==Predictions==
Experiments to date have not observed contradictions to Special Relativity.

It was initially speculated that ordinary special relativity and doubly special relativity would make distinct physical predictions in high-energy processes and, in particular, the derivation of the GZK limit on energies of cosmic rays from distant sources would not be valid. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any suppression of the GZK cutoff, contrary to the models where an absolute local rest frame exists, such as effective field theories like the Standard-Model Extension.

Since DSR generically (though not necessarily) implies an energy-dependence of the speed of light, it has further been predicted that, if there are modifications to first order in energy over the Planck mass, this energy-dependence would be observable in high energetic photons reaching Earth from distant gamma ray bursts. Depending on whether the now energy-dependent speed of light increases or decreases with energy (a model-dependent feature), highly energetic photons would be faster or slower than the lower energetic ones. However, the Fermi-LAT experiment in 2009 measured a 31 GeV photon, which nearly simultaneously arrived with other photons from the same burst, which excluded such dispersion effects even above the Planck energy. Moreover, it has been argued that DSR, with an energy-dependent speed of light, is inconsistent and first order effects are ruled out already because they would lead to non-local particle interactions that would long have been observed in particle physics experiments.

==De Sitter relativity==
Since the de Sitter group naturally incorporates an invariant length parameter, de Sitter relativity can be interpreted as an example of doubly special relativity because de Sitter spacetime incorporates invariant velocity, as well as length parameter. There is a fundamental difference, though: whereas in all doubly special relativity models the Lorentz symmetry is violated, in de Sitter relativity it remains as a physical symmetry. A drawback of the usual doubly special relativity models is that they are valid only at the energy scales where ordinary special relativity is supposed to break down, giving rise to a patchwork relativity. On the other hand, de Sitter relativity is found to be invariant under a simultaneous re-scaling of mass, energy and momentum, and is consequently valid at all energy scales.

<doc id="179948" wikidata="Q718809" url="?curid=179948" title="Positive psychology">
<text>Positive psychology is the scientific study of conditions and processes that contribute to positive psychological states (e.g., contentment, joy), well-being, positive relationships, and positive institutions.

Positive psychology began as a new domain of psychology in 1998 when Martin Seligman chose it as the theme for his term as president of the American Psychological Association. It is a reaction against past practices that tended to focus on mental illness and emphasized maladaptive behavior and negative thinking. It builds on the humanistic movement of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, which encourages an emphasis on happiness, well-being, and purpose. 

Positive psychology largely relies on concepts from the Western philosophical tradition, such as the Aristotelian concept of , which is typically rendered in English with the terms &quot;flourishing&quot;, &quot;the good life,&quot; or &quot;happiness&quot;. Positive psychologists study empirically the conditions and processes that contribute to flourishing, subjective well-being, and happiness, often using these terms interchangeably.

Positive psychologists suggest a number of factors that may contribute to happiness and subjective well-being, for example, social ties with a spouse, family, friends, colleagues, and wider networks; membership in clubs or social organizations; physical exercise; and the practice of meditation. Spiritual practice and religious commitment is another possible source for increased well-being. Happiness may rise with increasing income, though it may plateau or even fall when no further gains are made or after a certain cut-off amount.

Positive psychology has practical applications in various fields related to education, workplace, community development, and mental healthcare. This domain of psychology aims to enrich individuals&#x27; lives by promoting well-being and fostering positive experiences and characteristics, thus contributing to a more fulfilling and meaningful life.
== History ==

=== Influences from ancient history ===

Before the first use of the term &quot;positive psychology,&quot; researchers focused on topics that would now be included under the umbrella of positive psychology. Some view positive psychology as a meeting of Eastern thought, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, and Western psychodynamic approaches.

The historical Western roots of positive psychology are found in the teachings of Aristotle, whose &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; is a description of the theory and practice of human flourishing—which he referred to as &quot;eudaimonia&quot; (a Greek word literally translating to the state or condition of &quot;good spirit&quot;, and which is commonly translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or &quot;welfare)&quot;—of the tutelage necessary to achieve it, and of the psychological obstacles to its practice. It teaches the cultivation of virtues as the means of attaining happiness and well-being.

=== Influences from psychological domains and theoretical foundations ===
Scientific research on well-being dates back to the 1950s. Several humanistic psychologists, most notably Maslow, Carl Rogers, and Erich Fromm, developed theories and practices pertaining to human happiness and flourishing. More recently, positive psychologists have found empirical support for the humanistic theories of flourishing.

In 1984, psychologist Ed Diener published his tripartite model of subjective well-being, which posited 
&quot;three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive affect, infrequent negative affect, and cognitive evaluations such as life satisfaction.&quot; In this model, cognitive, affective, and contextual factors contribute to subjective well-being. According to Diener and Suh, subjective well-being is &quot;based on the idea that how each person thinks and feels about his or her life is important.&quot;

Carol Ryff&#x27;s six-factor model of psychological well-being was first published in 1989. It postulates that self-acceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, autonomy, and positive relations with others are crucial to well-being.

According to Corey Keyes, who collaborated with Carol Ryff and used the term flourishing as a central concept, mental well-being has three components: hedonic (i.e. subjective or emotional), psychological, and social well-being. Hedonic well-being concerns emotional aspects of well-being, whereas psychological and social well-being, e.g. eudaimonic well-being, concerns skills, abilities, and optimal functioning. This tripartite model of mental well-being has received cross-cultural empirical support.
The positive psychology movement was first founded in 1998 by Martin Seligman. He was concerned about the fact that mainstream psychology was too focused on disease, disorders, and disabilities rather than well-being, resilience, and recovery. He aimed to apply mainstream psychology&#x27;s methodological, scientific, scholarly, and organizational strengths to facilitate well-being rather than illness and disease.

The field has been influenced by humanistic and psychodynamic approaches to treatment. Predating the use of the term &quot;positive psychology&quot;, researchers within the field of psychology had focused on topics that would now be included under this new denomination.

The term &quot;positive psychology&quot; dates at least to 1954, when Abraham Maslow&#x27;s &quot;Motivation and Personality&quot; was published with a final chapter titled &quot;Toward a Positive Psychology.&quot; In the second edition published in 1970, he removed that chapter, saying in the preface that &quot;a positive psychology is at least available today though not very widely.&quot; There have been indications that psychologists since the 1950s have increasingly focused on promoting mental health rather than merely treating mental illness. From the beginning of psychology, the field addressed the human experience using the &quot;Disease model,&quot; studying and identifying the dysfunction of a person.

In the opening sentence of his book &quot;Authentic Happiness&quot;, Seligman claimed: &quot;For the last half century psychology has been consumed with a single topic only—mental illness,&quot; expanding on Maslow&#x27;s comments. He urged psychologists to continue the earlier missions of psychology of nurturing talent and improving everyday life.

===Development===
The first positive psychology summit took place in 1999. The First International Conference on Positive Psychology took place in 2002. In September 2005, the first master&#x27;s program in applied positive psychology (MAPP) was launched at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2006, a course on positive psychology at Harvard University was one of the most popular courses on offer. In June 2009, the First World Congress on Positive Psychology took place in Philadelphia.

The field of positive psychology today is most advanced in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia.

== Core concepts ==

===Core principles ===

Positive psychology, as defined by Martin Seligman and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is &quot;the scientific study of positive human functioning and flourishing on multiple levels that include the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life.&quot;

Positive psychology aims to complement and extend traditional problem-focused psychology. It concerns positive states (e.g. happiness), positive traits (e.g. talents, interests, strengths of character), positive relationships, and positive institutions and how these apply to physical health.

Seligman proposes that a person can best promote their well-being by nurturing their character strengths. Seligman identifies other possible goals of positive psychology: families and schools that allow children to grow, workplaces that aim for satisfaction and high productivity, and teaching others about positive psychology.

A basic premise of positive psychology is that human actions arise from our anticipations about the future; these anticipations are informed by our past experiences.

Those who practice positive psychology attempt psychological interventions that foster positive attitudes toward one&#x27;s subjective experiences, individual traits, and life events. The goal is to minimize pathological thoughts that may arise in a hopeless mindset and to develop a sense of optimism toward life. Positive psychologists seek to encourage acceptance of one&#x27;s past, excitement and optimism about one&#x27;s future, and a sense of contentment and well-being in the present.

====Happiness====

Two definitions: Happiness can be understood both as an enjoyable state of mind and the living of an enjoyable, fulfilling life.

====Quality of life====

Quality of life refers to overall well-being, encompassing not just physical and mental health but also socioeconomic factors. This concept is subjective and may vary across different cultures and regions.

===Research topics===
Positive psychology according to Seligman and Christopher Peterson, addresses three issues: 

# Positive emotions: These include contentment with the past, happiness with the present, and hope for the future. 
# Positive individual traits: These are strengths and virtues that define individuals.
# Positive institutions: Institutions that promote well-being and foster a sense of community. 

According to Peterson, positive psychologists are concerned with four topics: positive experiences, enduring psychological traits, positive relationships, and positive institutions. He also states that topics of interest to researchers in the field are states of pleasure or flow, values, strengths, virtues, talents, as well as the ways that these can be promoted by social systems and institutions.

==Theoretical frameworks==

There is no accepted &quot;gold standard&quot; theory in positive psychology. The work of Seligman is regularly quoted, as is the work of Csikszentmihalyi, and older models of well-being, such as Ryff&#x27;s six-factor model of psychological well-being and Diener&#x27;s tripartite model of subjective well-being.

Later, Paul Wong introduced the concept of second-wave positive psychology.

===Initial theory: three paths to happiness===
In &quot;Authentic Happiness&quot; (2002) Seligman proposed three kinds of a happy life that can be investigated:
# &quot;Pleasant life&quot;: research into the pleasant life, or the &quot;life of enjoyment&quot;, examines how people optimally experience, forecast, and savor the positive feelings and emotions that are part of normal and healthy living (e.g. relationships, hobbies, interests, entertainment, etc.). Seligman says this most transient element of happiness may be the least important.
# &quot;Good Life&quot;: investigation of the beneficial effects of immersion, absorption, and flow felt by people when optimally engaged with their primary activities, is the study of the Good Life, or the &quot;life of engagement&quot;. Flow is experienced when there is a match between a person&#x27;s strengths and their current task, i.e. when one feels confident of accomplishing a chosen or assigned task. Related concepts include self-efficacy and play.
# &quot;Meaningful Life&quot;: inquiry into the meaningful life, or &quot;life of affiliation&quot;, questions how people derive a positive sense of well-being, belonging, meaning, and purpose from being part of and contributing back to something larger and more enduring than themselves (e.g. nature, social groups, organizations, movements, traditions, belief systems).

===PERMA===

In &quot;Flourish&quot; (2011), Seligman argued that the last category of his proposed three kinds of a happy life, &quot;meaningful life&quot;, can be considered as three different categories. The resulting summary for this theory is the mnemonic acronym PERMA: Positive Emotions, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning and purpose, and Accomplishments.
; Positive emotions: include a wide range of feelings, not just happiness and joy, but excitement, satisfaction, pride, and awe, amongst others. These are connected to positive outcomes, such as longer life and healthier social relationships.
; Engagement: refers to involvement in activities that draw and build upon one&#x27;s interests. Csikszentmihalyi explains true engagement as &quot;flow&quot;, a state of deep effortless involvement, a feeling of intensity that leads to a sense of ecstasy and clarity. The task being done must call upon a particular skill and it should be possible while being a little bit challenging. Engagement involves passion for and concentration on the task at hand—complete absorption and loss of self-consciousness.
; Relationships: are essential in fueling positive emotions, whether they are work-related, familial, romantic, or platonic. As Peterson puts it, &quot;other people matter.&quot; Humans receive, share, and spread positivity to others through relationships. Relationships are important in bad times and good times. Relationships can be strengthened by reacting to one another positively. Typically positive things take place in the presence of other people.
; Meaning: is also known as &quot;purpose&quot;, and answers the question of &quot;why?&quot; Discovering a clear &quot;why&quot; puts everything into context from work to relationships to other parts of life. Finding meaning is learning that there is something greater than oneself. Working with meaning drives people to continue striving for a desirable goal.
; Accomplishments: are the pursuit of success and mastery. Unlike the other parts of PERMA, they are sometimes pursued even when accomplishments do not result in positive emotions, meaning, or relationships. Accomplishments can activate other elements of PERMA, such as pride, under positive emotion. Accomplishments can be individual or community-based, fun-based, or work-based.

Each of the five PERMA elements was selected according to three criteria:
# It contributes to well-being.
# It is pursued for its own sake.
# It is defined and measured independently of the other elements.

===&quot;Character Strengths and Virtues&quot;===

The &quot;Character Strengths and Virtues&quot; (CSV) handbook (2004) was the first attempt by Seligman and Peterson to identify and classify positive psychological traits of human beings. Much like the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) of general psychology, the CSV provided a theoretical framework to assist in understanding strengths and virtues and for developing practical applications for positive psychology. It identified six classes of virtues (i.e., &quot;core virtues&quot;), underlying 24 measurable character strengths.

The CSV suggested these six virtues have a historical basis in the vast majority of cultures and that they can lead to increased happiness when built upon. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality leads to three theories:
# The study of positive human qualities broadens the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness.
# The leaders of the positive psychology movement challenge moral relativism by suggesting people are &quot;evolutionarily predisposed&quot; toward certain virtues.
# Virtue has a biological basis.

The organization of the six virtues and 24 strengths is as follows:
# Wisdom and knowledge: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, innovation, prudence
# Courage: bravery, persistence, vitality, zest
# Humanity: love, kindness, social intelligence
# Justice: citizenship, fairness, leadership, integrity, excellence
# Temperance: forgiveness and mercy, humility, self-control
# Transcendence: appreciation of beauty, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality

Subsequent research challenged the need for six virtues. Instead, researchers suggested the 24 strengths are more accurately grouped into just three or four categories: Intellectual Strengths, Interpersonal Strengths, and Temperance Strengths, or alternatively, Interpersonal Strengths, Fortitude, Vitality, and Cautiousness. These strengths, and their classifications, have emerged independently elsewhere in literature on values. Paul Thagard described some examples.

===Flow===

In the 1970s, Csikszentmihalyi began studying &quot;flow&quot;, a state of absorption in which one&#x27;s abilities are well-matched to the demands at-hand. He often refers to it as &quot;optimal experience&quot;. Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense that &quot;time is flying.&quot; Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player). Anyone can experience flow and it can be felt in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work.

Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one&#x27;s personal abilities. A mismatch of challenge for someone of low skills results in a state of anxiety and feeling overwhelmed; insufficient challenge for someone highly skilled results in boredom. A good example of this would be an adult reading a children&#x27;s book. They would not feel challenged enough to be engaged or motivated in the reading. Csikszentmihalyi explained this using various combinations of challenge and skills to predict psychological states. These four states included the following:

; Apathy: low challenge and low skill(s)
; Relaxation: low challenge and high skill(s)
; Anxiety: high challenge and low skill(s)
; Flow: high challenge and high skill(s)

Accordingly, an adult reading a children&#x27;s book would most likely be in the relaxation state. The adult has no need to worry that the task will be more than they can handle. Challenge is a well-founded explanation for how one enters the flow state and employs intense concentration. However, other factors contribute. For example, one must be intrinsically motivated to participate in the activity or challenge. If the person is not interested in the task, then there is no possibility of their being absorbed into the flow state.

==== Benefits ====
Flow can help in parenting children. When flow is enhanced parents and children, the parents can better thrive in their roles as a parents. A parenting style that is positively oriented results in children who experience lower levels of stress and improved well-being.

Flow also has benefits in a school setting. When students are in a state of flow they are fully engaged, leading to better retention of information. Students who experience flow have a more enjoyable and rewarding experience. This state can also reduce stress, which helps with students&#x27; mental health and well-being. This increases resilience and helps students to overcome challenges or setbacks by teaching them a growth mindset.

Most teachers and parents want students become more engaged and interested in the classroom. The design of the education system was not able to account for such needs. One school implemented a program called PASS. They acknowledged that students needed more challenge and individual advancement; they referred to this as sport culture. This PASS program integrated an elective class into which students could immerse themselves. Such activities included self-paced learning, mastery-based learning, performance learning, and so on.

Flow benefits general well-being. It is a positive and intrinsically motivating experience. It is known to &quot;produce intense feelings of enjoyment&quot;. It can improve our lives by making them happier and more meaningful. Csikszentmihalyi discovered that our personal growth and development generates happiness. Flow is positive experience because it promotes that opportunity for personal development.

====Negatives====

While flow can be beneficial to students, students who experience flow can become overly focused on a particular task. This can lead to students neglecting other important aspects of their learning.

In positive psychology there can be misunderstandings on what clinicians and people define as positive. In certain instances, positive qualities, such as optimism, can be detrimental to health, and therefore appear as a negative quality. Alternatively, negative processes, such as anxiety, can be conducive to health and stability and thus would appear as positive qualities. A second wave of positive psychology has further identified and characterized &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; complexes through the use of critical and dialectical thinking. Researchers in 2016 chose to identify these characteristics via two complexes: post-traumatic growth and love as well as optimism vs. pessimism.

=== Second-wave positive psychology ===

Paul Wong introduced the idea of a second wave of positive psychology, focused on the pursuit of meaning in life, which he contrasted with the pursuit of happiness in life. Ivtzan, Lomas, Hefferon, and Worth have recast positive psychology as being about positive outcome or positive mental health, and have explored the positive outcomes of embracing negative emotions and pessimism. Second-wave positive psychology proposes that it is better to accept and transform the meaning of suffering than it is to avoid suffering.

In 2016, Lomas and Itzvan proposed that human flourishing (their goal for positive psychology) is about embracing dialectic interplay of positive and negative. Phenomena cannot be determined to be positive or negative independent of context. Some of their examples included:

; the dialectic of optimism and pessimism: Optimism is associated with longevity, but strategic pessimism can lead to more effective planning and decision making.
; the dialectic of self-esteem and humility: Self-esteem is related to well-being, but pursuit of self-esteem can increase depression. Humility can be either low self-opinion or it can lead to prosocial action. 
; the dialectic of forgiveness and anger: Forgiveness has been associated with well-being, but people who are more forgiving of abuse may suffer prolonged abuse. While anger has been presented as a destructive emotion, it can also be a moral emotion and drawn upon to confront injustices.

In 2019, Wong proposed four principles of second-wave positive psychology:

# accepting and confronting with courage the reality that life is full of evil and suffering
# sustainable wellbeing can only be achieved through overcoming suffering and the dark side of life
# recognizing that everything in life comes in polarities and the importance of achieving an adaptive balance through dialectics
# learning from indigenous psychology, such as the ancient wisdom of finding deep joy in bad situations
Second-wave positive psychology is sometimes abbreviated as PP 2.0.

=== Third-wave positive psychology ===
The third wave of positive psychology emphasizes going beyond the individual to take a deeper look at the groups and systems in which we live. It also promotes becoming more interdisciplinary and multicultural and incorporates more methodologies.

In broadening the scope and exploring the systemic and socio-cultural dimensions of people&#x27;s lived realities, there are four specific things to focus on:

# The focus of enquiry: becoming more interested in emergent paradigms like &quot;systems-informed positive psychology&quot; which incorporates principles and concepts from the systems sciences to optimize human social systems and the individuals within them.
# Disciplines: becoming more multi- and interdisciplinary, as reflected in hybrid formulations like positive education, which combines traditional education and research based ways of increasing happiness and overall well-being.
# Cultural contexts: becoming more multicultural and global.
# Methodologies: embracing other paradigms and ways of knowing, such as qualitative and mixed methods approaches rather than relying solely on quantitative research.

== Research and evidence ==
Subject-matter and methodology development expanded the field of positive psychology beyond its core theories and methods. Positive psychology is now a global area of study, with various national indices tracking citizens&#x27; happiness ratings.

=== Research findings ===
Research in positive psychology, well-being, and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes, and Seligman cover a broad range of topics including &quot;the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life.&quot;

A meta-analysis of 49 studies showed that Positive Psychology Interventions (PPI) produced improvements in well-being and lower depression levels; the PPIs studied included writing gratitude letters, learning optimistic thinking, replaying positive life experiences, and socializing with others. In a later meta-analysis of 39 studies with 6,139 participants, the outcomes were positive. Three to six months after a PPI the effects on subjective well-being and psychological well-being were still significant. However the positive effect was weaker than in the earlier meta-analysis; the authors concluded that this was because they only used higher-quality studies. The PPIs they considered included counting blessings, kindness practices, making personal goals, showing gratitude, and focusing on personal strengths. Another review of PPIs found that over 78% of intervention studies were conducted in Western countries.

In the textbook &quot;Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness&quot;, authors Compton and Hoffman give the &quot;Top Down Predictors&quot; of well-being as high self esteem, optimism, self efficacy, a sense of meaning in life, and positive relationships with others. The personality traits most associated with well-being are extraversion, agreeability, and low levels of neuroticism.

In a study published in 2020, students were enrolled in a positive psychology course that focused on improving happiness and well-being through teaching about positive psychology. The participants answered questions pertaining to the five PERMA categories. At the end of the semester those same students reported significantly higher scores in all categories (p&lt;.001) except for engagement which was significant at p&lt;.05. The authors stated, “Not only do students learn and get credit, there is also a good chance that many will reap the benefits in what is most important to them—their health, happiness, and well-being.”

A systematic review was conducted to explore the impact of positive psychology interventions on breast cancer patients&#x27; mental and physical well-being. The review analyzed multiple studies that examined interventions such as mindfulness, gratitude practices, and strengths-based approaches in improving quality of life for those diagnosed with breast cancer. Results consistently demonstrated that these interventions significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, while fostering resilience, optimism, and emotional well-being. Furthermore, positive psychology approaches were found to enhance patients&#x27; adherence to treatment and improve their ability to cope with the challenges of illness and recovery. This review highlights the growing evidence for incorporating positive psychology into breast cancer care, underscoring its potential to support both mental health and holistic recovery in patients.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using various positive psychology techniques to enhance the well-being of individuals with psychiatric and somatic disorders, including breast cancer patients. Key methods included mindfulness-based interventions, gratitude exercises, and strength identification, which aimed to build emotional resilience. Additionally, practices like savoring, cognitive reappraisal, and self-compassion were employed to foster positive emotions and coping strategies. These interventions significantly contributed to reducing distress and promoting overall psychological health by encouraging patients to focus on positive aspects of life despite their challenges.

== Academic methods ==

=== Quantitative ===

Quantitative methods in positive psychology include p-technique factor analysis, dynamic factor analysis, interindividual differences and structural equation modeling, spectral analysis and item response models, dynamic systems analysis, latent growth analysis, latent-class models, hierarchical linear modeling, measurement invariance, experimental methods, behavior genetics, and integration of quantitative and qualitative approaches.

=== Qualitative ===
Grant J. Rich explored the use of qualitative methodology to study positive psychology. Rich addresses the popularity of quantitative methods in studying the empirical questions that positive psychology presents. He argues that there is an &quot;overemphasis&quot; on quantitative methods and suggests implementing qualitative methods, such as semi-structured interviews, observations, fieldwork, creative artwork, and focus groups. Rich states that qualitative approaches will further promote the &quot;flourishing of positive psychology&quot; and encourages such practice.

=== Behavioral interventions ===
Changing happiness levels through interventions is a further methodological advancement in the study of positive psychology, and has been the focus of various academic and scientific psychological publications. Happiness-enhancing interventions include expressing kindness, gratitude, optimism, humility, awe, and mindfulness.

One behavioral experiment used two six-week interventions: one involving the performance of acts of kindness, and one focused on gratitude which emphasized the counting of one&#x27;s blessings. The study participants who went through the behavioral interventions reported higher levels of happiness and well-being than those who did not participate in either intervention.

Another study found that the interventions of expressing optimism and expressing gratitude enhanced subjective well-being in participants who took part in the intervention for eight months. The researchers concluded that interventions are &quot;most successful when participants know about, endorse, and commit to the intervention.&quot; The article provides support that when people enthusiastically take part in behavioral interventions, such as expression of optimism and gratitude, they may increase happiness and subjective well-being.

Another study examined the interaction effects between gratitude and humility through behavior interventions. The interventions were writing a gratitude letter and writing a 14-day diary. In both interventions, the researchers found that gratitude and humility are connected and are &quot;mutually reinforcing.&quot; The study also discusses how gratitude, and its associated humility, may lead to more positive emotional states and subjective well-being.

A series of experiments showed a positive effect of awe on subjective well-being. People who felt awe also reported feeling they had more time, more preference for experiential expenditures than material expenditures, and greater life satisfaction. Experiences that heighten awe may lead to higher levels of life satisfaction and, in turn, higher levels of happiness and subjective well-being.

Mindfulness interventions may also increase subjective well-being in people who mindfully meditate. Being mindful in meditation includes awareness and observation of one&#x27;s meditation practice, with non-reactive and non-judgmental sentiments during meditation.

=== National indices of happiness ===
The creation of various national indices of happiness have expanded the field of positive psychology to a global scale.

In a January 2000 article in &quot;American Psychologist&quot;, psychologist Ed Diener argued for the creation of a national happiness index in the United States. Such an index could provide measurements of happiness, or subjective well-being, within the United States and across many other countries in the world. Diener argued that national indices would be helpful markers or indicators of population happiness, providing a sense of current ratings and a tracker of happiness across time. Diener proposed that the national index include various sub-measurements of subjective well-being, including &quot;pleasant affect, unpleasant affect, life satisfaction, fulfillment, and more specific states such as stress, affection, trust, and joy.&quot;

In 2012, the first World Happiness Report was published. The World Happiness Report was initiated by the UN General Assembly in June 2011, when it passed the Bhutanese Resolution. The Bhutanese Resolution called for nations across the world to &quot;give more importance to happiness and well-being in determining how to achieve and measure social and economic development.&quot; The data for the World Happiness Reports is collected in partnership with the Gallup World Poll&#x27;s life evaluations and annual happiness rankings. The World Happiness Report bases its national rankings on how happy constituents believe themselves to be.

The first World Happiness Report, published in 2012, detailed the state of world happiness, the causes of happiness and misery, policy implications from happiness reports, and three case studies of subjective well-being for 1) Bhutan and its Gross National Happiness index, 2) the U.K. Office for National Statistics Experience, and 3) happiness in the member countries within the OECD.

The 2020 World Happiness Report, the eighth in the series of reports, was the first to include happiness rankings of cities across the world, in addition to rankings of 156 countries. The city of Helsinki, Finland was reported as the city with the highest subjective well-being ranking, and the country of Finland was reported as the country with the highest subjective well-being ranking. The 2020 report provided insights on happiness based on environmental conditions, social conditions, urban-rural happiness differentials, and sustainable development. It also provided possible explanations for why Nordic countries have consistently ranked in the top ten happiest countries in the World Happiness Report, such as Nordic countries&#x27; high-quality government benefits and protections to its citizens, including welfare benefits and well-operated democratic institutions, as well as social connections, bonding, and trust.

Additional national well-being indices and reported statistics include the Gallup Global Emotions Report, Sharecare Community Well-Being Index, Global Happiness Council&#x27;s Global Happiness and Well-being Policy Report, Happy Planet Index, OECD Better Life Index, and UN Human Development Reports.

== Applications ==
Positive psychology influenced other academic fields of study and scholarship, notably organizational behavior, education, and psychiatry.

=== Positive organizational scholarship ===
Positive organizational scholarship (POS), also referred to as positive organizational behavior (POB), began as an application of positive psychology to the field of organizational behavior. An early use of the term was in &quot;Positive Organizational Scholarship: Foundations of a New Discipline&quot; (2003), edited by Ross School of Business professors Kim S. Cameron, Jane E. Dutton, and Robert E. Quinn. The editors promote &quot;the best of the human condition&quot;, such as goodness, compassion, resilience, and positive human potential, as an organizational goal as important as financial success. The goal of POS is to study the factors that create positive work experiences and successful, people-oriented outcomes.

The 2011 volume &quot;The Oxford Handbook of Positive Organizational Scholarship&quot;, covers such topics as positive human resource practices, positive organizational practices, and positive leadership and change. It applies positive psychology to the workplace context, covering areas such as positive individual attributes, positive emotions, strengths and virtues, and positive relationships. The editors of that volume define POS this way:

=== Psychiatry ===
Positive psychology influenced psychiatry and led to more widespread promotion of practices including well-being therapy, positive psychotherapy, and an integration of positive psychology in therapeutic practice.

Benefits of positive influences can be seen in practices like positive psychological interventions (PPIs). It is an intervention designed to promote positive outcomes by implying positive activities such as imposing adaptive personality traits to be praised and encouraged. Research has found that PPIs has the potential to improve medical and psychiatric disorders of individuals with depression and suicidal levels. Department of Developmental Services (DDS) did a research on a 52-year-old single gay man with bipolar II disorder and attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) with low self-esteem. In addition, there were other focuses of this research: promoting kindness behavior, identifying, and encouraging internal strengths to reach a fulfilling life. PPIs increases the individuality&#x27;s purpose with constant strengthen on personality traits and behavior positivity.

Psychoanalysis can be used to treat mental illnesses such as depression as it focuses on identifying the conscious and unconscious motivations and behaviors affecting one&#x27;s life. Treatment using psychoanalysis runs in a longer duration by practicing free association to promote personal growth. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a common type of psychotherapy, focuses on both psychoanalysis and behavioral analysis: psychoanalysts focusing on conscious and unconscious motivations, behaviorists focusing on objectively measured behaviors. Therapy such as exposure therapy helps people with specific aspects of depression, or more specific cases like social phobia.

Positive psychology may assist those recovering from traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI rehabilitation practices rely on bettering the patient&#x27;s life by getting them to engage (or re-engage) in normal everyday practices, an idea which is related to tenets of positive psychology. While the empirical evidence for positive psychology is limited, positive psychology&#x27;s focus on small successes, optimism, and prosocial behavior promises to improve the social and emotional well-being of TBI patients.

=== Media and industry ===
Positive psychology is a subject of popular books and films, and influences the wellness industry.

==== Books ====
Several popular psychology books have been written for a general audience.

Ilona Boniwell&#x27;s &quot;Positive Psychology in a Nutshell&quot; provided a summary of the research. According to Boniwell, well-being is related to optimism, extraversion, social connections (i.e., close friendships), being married, having engaging work, religion or spirituality, leisure, good sleep and exercise, social class (through lifestyle differences and better coping methods), and subjective health (what you think about your health). Boniwell writes that well-being is not related to age, physical attractiveness, money (once basic needs are met), gender (women are more often depressed but also more often joyful), educational level, having children, moving to a sunnier climate, crime prevention, housing, and objective health (what doctors say).

Sonja Lyubomirsky&#x27;s &quot;The How of Happiness&quot; provides advice on how to improve happiness. According to this book, people should create new habits, seek out new emotions, use variety and timing to prevent hedonic adaptation, and enlist others to support the creation of those new habits. Lyubomirsky recommends twelve happiness activities, including savoring life, learning to forgive, and living in the present.

&quot;Stumbling on Happiness&quot; by Daniel Gilbert shares positive psychology research suggesting that people are often poor at predicting what will make them happy and that people are prone to misevaluating the causes of their happiness. He notes that the subjectivity of well-being and happiness often is the most difficult challenge to overcome in predicting future happiness, as our future selves may have different perspectives on life than our current selves.

==== Films ====
The film industry noticed positive psychology, and films have spurred new research within positive psychology.

&quot;Happy&quot; is a full-length documentary film covering positive psychology and neuroscience. It highlights case studies on happiness across diverse cultures and geographies. The film features interviews with notable positive psychologists and scholars, including Gilbert, Diener, Lyubomirsky, and Csikszentmihalyi.

For several years, the &quot;Positive Psychology News&quot; website included a section on Positive Psychology Movie Awards that highlighted feature films that featured messages of positive psychology.

The VIA Institute has researched positive psychology as represented in feature films. Contemporary and popular films that promote or represent character strengths are the basis for various academic articles.

In Positive Psychology at the Movies, Ryan Niemiec and Danny Wedding explore how mainstream films—ranging from Groundhog Day to The Pursuit of Happyness—illustrate character strengths, hope, and personal growth.

==== Wellness industry ====
The growing popularity and attention given to positive psychology research has influenced industry growth, development, and consumption of products and services meant to cater to wellness and well-being.

According to the Global Wellness Institute, as of 2023, the global wellness economy is valued at trillion; the key sectors of the industry included Nutrition, Personal Care and Beauty, and Physical activity, while the Mental wellness and Public health sectors accounted for approximately billion.

Companies highlight happiness and well-being in their marketing strategies. Food and beverage companies such as Coca-Cola and Pocky—whose motto is &quot;Share happiness!&quot;—emphasize happiness in their commercials, branding, and descriptions. CEOs at retail companies such as Zappos have profited by publishing books detailing how they deliver happiness, while Amazon&#x27;s logo features a dimpled smile.

==Criticism and limitations==
Many aspects of positive psychology have been criticized.

It has been suggested that positive psychology lacks proper theorizing and conceptual thinking, problematic as far as measurements and methodologies were concerned, seen as a pseudoscience that lacks evidence and had poor replication, lacks novelty and self-isolated itself for mainstream psychology, was a decontextualized neoliberalist ideology that caused harm and was a capitalistic venture. 

=== Reality distortion ===

==== Positive illusions ====
In 1988, psychologists Shelley E. Taylor and Jonathan D. Brown co-authored a &quot;Psychological Bulletin&quot; article that coined the phrase positive illusions. Positive illusions are the cognitive processes people engage in when they self-aggrandize or self-enhance. They are unrealistically positive or self-affirming attitudes that individuals hold about themselves, their position, or their environment. They are attitudes of extreme optimism that endure in the face of facts and real conditions.

Taylor and Brown suggest that positive illusions protect people from negative feedback that they might receive, and this, in turn, preserves their psychological adaptation and subjective well-being. However, later research found that positive illusions and related attitudes lead to psychological maladaptive conditions such as poorer social relationships, expressions of narcissism, and negative workplace outcomes, thus reducing the positive effects that positive illusions have on subjective well-being, overall happiness, and life satisfaction.

Kirk Schneider, editor of the &quot;Journal of Humanistic Psychology&quot;, pointed to research showing high positivity correlates with positive illusion, which distorts reality. High positivity or flourishing could make one incapable of psychological growth, unable to self-reflect, and prone to holding racial biases. By contrast, negativity, sometimes evidenced in mild to moderate depression, is correlated with less distortion of reality. Therefore, Schneider argues, negativity might play an important role: engaging in conflict and acknowledging appropriate negativity, including certain negative emotions like guilt, might better promote flourishing. Schneider wrote: &quot;perhaps genuine happiness is not something you aim at, but is... a by-product of a life well lived—and a life well lived does not settle on the programmed or neatly calibrated.&quot;

==== Role of negativity ====
Barbara S. Held, a professor at Bowdoin College, argues that positive psychology has faults: negative side effects, negativity within the positive psychology movement, and the division in the field of psychology caused by differing opinions of psychologists on positive psychology. She notes the movement&#x27;s lack of consistency regarding the role of negativity. She also raises issues with the simplistic approach taken by some psychologists in the application of positive psychology. A &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach is arguably not beneficial; she suggests a need for individual differences to be incorporated into its application. By teaching young people that being confident and optimistic leads to success, when they are unsuccessful they may believe this is because they are insecure or pessimistic. This could lead them to believe that any negative internal thought or feeling they may experience is damaging to their happiness and should be steered clear of completely.

Held prefers the Second Wave Positive Psychology message of embracing the dialectic nature of positive and negative, and questions the need to call it &quot;positive&quot; psychology.

==== Toxic positivity ====
One critical response to positive psychology concerns &quot;toxic positivity&quot;. Toxic positivity is when people do not fully acknowledge, process, or manage the entire spectrum of human emotion, including anger and sadness. This genre of criticism argues that positive psychology places too much importance on &quot;upbeat thinking, while shunting challenging and difficult experiences to the side.&quot; People who engage in a constant chase for positive experiences or states of high subjective well-being may inadvertently stigmatize negative emotional conditions such as depression, or may suppress natural emotional responses, such as sadness, regret, or stress. Furthermore, by not allowing negative emotional states to be experienced, or by suppressing and hiding negative emotional responses, people may experience harmful physical, cardiovascular, and respiratory consequences. Opponents of toxic positivity advocate accepting and fully experiencing negative emotional states.

=== Methodological and philosophical critiques ===

Richard Lazarus critiqued positive psychology&#x27;s methodological and philosophical components. He holds that giving more detail and insight into the positive is not bad, but not at the expense of the negative, because the two (positive and negative) are inseparable. Among his critiques:

# Positive psychology&#x27;s use of correlational and cross-sectional research designs to indicate causality between the movement&#x27;s ideas and healthy lives may hide other factors and time differences that account for observed differences.
# Emotions cannot be categorized dichotomously into positive and negative; emotions are subjective and rich in social/relational meaning. Emotions are fluid, meaning that the context they appear in changes over time. Lazarus states that &quot;all emotions have the potential of being either one or the other, or both, on different occasions, and even on the same occasion when an emotion is experienced by different persons&quot; 
# Individual differences are neglected in most social science research. Many research designs focus on the statistical significance of the groups while overlooking differences among people.
# Social science researchers&#x27; tend to not adequately define and measure emotions. Most assessments are quick checklists and do not provide adequate debriefing. Many researchers do not differentiate between fluid emotional states and relatively stable personality traits.

Lazarus holds that positive psychology claims to be new and innovative but the majority of research on stress and coping theory makes many of the same claims as positive psychology. The movement attempts to uplift and reinforce the positive aspects of one&#x27;s life, but everyone in life experiences stress and hardship. Coping through these events should not be regarded as adapting to failures but as successfully navigating stress, but the movement doesn&#x27;t hold that perspective.

Another critique of positive psychology is that it has been developed from a Eurocentric worldview. Intersectionality has become a methodological concern regarding studies within Positive Psychology.

A literature review conducted in 2022 noted several criticisms of the area, including lack of conceptual thinking, problematic measurements, poor replication of results, self-isolation from mainstream psychology, decontextualization, and being used for capitalism.

=== Narrow focus ===
In 2003, Ian Sample noted that &quot;Positive psychologists also stand accused of burying their heads in the sand and ignoring that depressed, even merely unhappy people, have real problems that need dealing with.&quot; He quoted Steven Wolin, a clinical psychiatrist at George Washington University, as saying that the study of positive psychology is just a reiteration of older ways of thinking, and that there is not much scientific research to support the efficacy of this method.

Psychological researcher Shelly Gable retorts that positive psychology is just bringing a balance to a side of psychology that is glaringly understudied. She points to imbalances favoring research into negative psychological well-being in cognitive psychology, health psychology, and social psychology.

Psychologist Jack Martin maintains that positive psychology is not unique in its optimistic approach to emotional well-being, stating that other forms of psychology, such as counseling and educational psychology, are also interested in positive human fulfillment. He says while positive psychology pushes for schools to be more student-centered and able to foster positive self-images in children, a lack of focus on self-control may prevent children from making full contributions to society. If positive psychology is not implemented correctly, it can cause more harm than good. This is the case, for example, when interventions in school are coercive (in the sense of being imposed on everyone without regard for the child&#x27;s reason for negativity) and fail to take each student&#x27;s context into account.

=== Applications and misapplications ===

==== The US Army&#x27;s Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program ====

The Comprehensive Soldier Fitness (CSF) program was established in 2008 by then-Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George W. Casey, Jr., in an effort to address increasing rates of drug abuse, family violence, PTSD, and suicide among soldiers. The Army contracted with Seligman&#x27;s Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania to supply a program based on the center&#x27;s Penn Resiliency Program, which was designed for 10- to 14-year-old children. Although Seligman proposed starting with a small-scale pilot-test, General Casey insisted on immediately rolling out the CSF to the entire Army. Interviewed for the journal &quot;Monitor on Psychology&quot; of the American Psychological Association, Seligman said that &quot;This is the largest study—1.1 million soldiers—psychology has ever been involved in.&quot; According to journalist Jesse Singal, &quot;It would become one of the largest mental-health interventions geared at a single population in the history of humanity, and possibly the most expensive.&quot;

Some psychologists criticized the CSF for various reasons. Nicholas J.L. Brown wrote: &quot;The idea that techniques that have demonstrated, at best, marginal effects in reducing depressive symptoms in school-age children could also prevent the onset of a condition that is associated with some of the most extreme situations with which humans can be confronted is a remarkable one that does not seem to be backed up by empirical evidence.&quot;
Stephen Soldz of the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis cited Seligman&#x27;s acknowledgment that the CSF is a gigantic study rather than a program based on proven techniques, and questioned the ethics of requiring soldiers to participate in research without informed consent. Soldz also criticized the CSF training for trying to build up-beat attitudes toward combat: &quot;Might soldiers who have been trained to resiliently view combat as a growth opportunity be more likely to ignore or under-estimate real dangers, thereby placing themselves, their comrades, or civilians at heightened risk of harm?&quot;

In 2021 the Chronicle of Higher Education carried a debate between Singal and Seligman about whether, with the CSF well into its second decade, there was any solid evidence of its effectiveness. Singal cited studies that, he said, failed to find any measurable benefits from such positive psychology techniques, and he criticized the Army&#x27;s own reports as methodologically unsound and lacking peer review. Seligman said that Singal had misinterpreted the studies and ignored the Army&#x27;s positive feedback from soldiers, one of whom told Seligman that &quot;if I had had this training years ago, it would have saved my marriage.&quot;

=== Equality gaps and underrepresentation ===

==== Demographic diversity ====
Positive psychology has historically been critiqued for its lack of demographic diversity, both in terms of its research populations and its theoretical frameworks. Much of the early research in positive psychology was conducted predominantly with Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) populations, leading to concerns about the generalizability of its findings across different demographic groups. Recent studies have highlighted the need for more inclusive research that encompasses a broader range of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds to ensure that positive psychology interventions are applicable and effective for diverse populations.

==== Cultural sensitivity ====
The concept of cultural sensitivity is crucial for positive psychology, yet it has faced criticism for insufficient consideration of cultural contexts. Positive psychology&#x27;s principles, such as subjective well-being and character strengths, may not universally apply or be valued equally across all cultures. For instance, in collectivist cultures, individuals prioritize collective well-being over individual happiness, and thus, frameworks like the PERMA model may need adaptation to reflect these values. Additionally, there is a call for more cross-cultural research to validate the applicability of positive psychology interventions globally and to integrate culturally relevant practices and perspectives.

==== Accessibility ====
Accessibility issues are a significant concern within positive psychology. Interventions and practices derived from positive psychology may not be equally accessible to all populations, particularly those from marginalized or lower socioeconomic backgrounds. There is evidence that socioeconomic factors can impact the effectiveness and availability of positive psychology interventions, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities. To address these gaps, there is a growing emphasis on developing and implementing positive psychology practices that are affordable and accessible to diverse communities, including those with limited resources.

== Future directions ==
Positive psychology continues to evolve with ongoing research and practical applications expanding its scope and impact. Future directions in positive psychology focus on integrating emerging insights, addressing criticism, and exploring new areas of application to enhance well-being and human flourishing. Cross-cultural research is essential to explore how positive psychology practices perform across different cultural settings and to refine interventions for global application. Some researchers have written that
addressing criticisms related to methodological rigor, theoretical clarity, and practical applicability should be a priority, with a focus on enhancing the robustness of positive psychology research methodologies, improving the replicability of findings, and addressing the critiques related to the movement&#x27;s focus and applicability.

<doc id="179950" wikidata="Q945627" url="?curid=179950" title="Odyssey (Yngwie Malmsteen album)">
<text>Odyssey is the fourth studio album by guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, released on 8 April 1988 through Polydor Records. The album reached No. 40 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and remained on that chart for eighteen weeks, as well as reaching the top 50 in five other countries. As of 2021 it remains Malmsteen&#x27;s highest-charting release on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Critical reception==

Steve Huey at AllMusic gave &quot;Odyssey&quot; two stars out of five, calling it &quot;a more subdued, polished collection seemingly designed for mainstream radio airplay&quot;, but that it &quot;shows little difference in approach from [Malmsteen&#x27;s] previous output&quot;. He praised Joe Lynn Turner&#x27;s vocals and Malmsteen&#x27;s guitar work, but remarked that the latter sounds &quot;constrained and passionless&quot; due in part to his recovery from a near-fatal car accident in 1987.

<doc id="179955" wikidata="Q157309" url="?curid=179955" title="Simone Weil">
<text>Simone Adolphine Weil ( ; ; 3 February 1909 – 24 August 1943) was a French philosopher, mystic and political activist. Since 1995, more than 5,000 scholarly works have been published about her, including close analyses and readings of her work.

After her graduation from formal education, Weil became a teacher. She taught intermittently throughout the 1930s, taking several breaks because of poor health and in order to devote herself to political activism. She assisted in the trade union movement, taking the side of the anarchists known as the Durruti Column in the Spanish Civil War. She worked for more than a year as a labourer, mostly in car factories, so that she could better understand the working class.

Weil became increasingly religious and inclined towards mysticism as her life progressed. She wrote throughout her life, although most of her writings did not attract much attention until after her death. In the 1950s and &#x27;60s, her work became famous in continental Europe and throughout the English-speaking world. Her thought has continued to be the subject of extensive scholarship across a wide range of fields.

The mathematician André Weil was her brother.

==Early life==


Weil was born in her parents&#x27; apartment in Paris on 3 February 1909, the daughter of Bernard Weil (1872–1955), a medical doctor from an agnostic Alsatian Jewish background, who moved to Paris after the German annexation of Alsace–Lorraine and Salomea &quot;Selma&quot; Reinherz (1879–1965), who was born into a Jewish family in Rostov-on-Don and raised in Belgium. According to Osmo Pekonen, &quot;the family name Weil came to be when many Levis in the Napoleonic era changed their names this way, by anagram.&quot; Weil was a healthy baby for her first six months, but then suffered a severe attack of appendicitis; thereafter, she struggled with poor health throughout her life. Weil&#x27;s parents were fairly affluent and raised their children in an attentive and supportive atmosphere. She was the younger of her parents&#x27; two children. Her brother was mathematician André Weil (1906–1998), with whom she would always enjoy a close relationship.

Weil was distressed by her father having to leave home for several years after being drafted to serve in the First World War. Eva Fogelman, Robert Coles and several other scholars believe that this experience may have contributed to the exceptionally strong altruism which Weil displayed throughout her life. For example, a young Weil sent her share of sugar and chocolate to soldiers fighting at the front. When Weil was 10 she joined striking workers chanting L&#x27;Internationale marching on the street below her apartment. When visiting a resort with her family and learning of the wages of the workers she encouraged the workers to unionize.

From her childhood home, Weil acquired an obsession with cleanliness; in her later life she would sometimes speak of her &quot;disgustingness&quot; and think that others would see her this way, even though in her youth she had been considered highly attractive. Weil was generally highly affectionate, but she almost always avoided any form of physical contact, even with female friends.

Weil&#x27;s mother stated that her daughter much preferred boys to girls and that she always did her best to teach her daughter what she believed were masculine virtues. According to her friend and biographer, Simone Pétrement, Weil decided early in life that she would need to adopt masculine qualities and sacrifice opportunities for love affairs in order to fully pursue her vocation to improve social conditions for the disadvantaged. From her late teenage years, Weil would generally disguise her &quot;fragile beauty&quot; by adopting a masculine appearance, hardly ever using makeup and often wearing men&#x27;s clothes. Both Weil&#x27;s parents referred to her as “our son number two,” at the request of Weil and in letters to her parents while a student, she used the masculine form of French participles and signed her name the masculine &quot;Simon&quot;.

==Academic studies==
Weil was a precocious student and was proficient in Ancient Greek by age 12. She later learned Sanskrit so that she could read the Bhagavad Gita in the original.

As a teenager, Weil studied at the Lycée Henri IV under the tutelage of her admired teacher Émile Chartier, more commonly known as &quot;Alain&quot;.

Weil attracted much attention at the Lycée Henri IV with her radical opinions and actions such as organising against the military draft. For these reasons she was called the &quot;Red Virgin&quot;, and even &quot;The Martian&quot; by her mentor. Weil gained a reputation for her strict devotion to ethics, with classmates referring to her as the &quot;categorical imperative in skirts&quot;. Officials at the school were outraged by her indifference to clothing, her refusal to participate in their traditions, and her ignoring a rule banning women from smoking with male students, for which she was suspended.

At ENS, Weil briefly met Simone de Beauvoir, and their meeting led to disagreement. Weil stated that, &quot;one thing alone mattered in the world today: the revolution that would feed all people on earth,&quot; with a young Beauvoir replying that the point of life was to find meaning, not happiness. Weil cut her off, stating that, &quot;it&#x27;s easy to see you&#x27;ve never gone hungry&quot;. 

Weil finished first in the exam for the certificate of &quot;General Philosophy and Logic&quot; with Simone de Beauvoir finishing second. In 1931 Weil earned her DES (&quot;&quot;, roughly equivalent to an M.A.), with a thesis titled, &quot;Science et perception dans Descartes&quot; (&quot;Science and Perception in Descartes&quot;). She received her &quot;agrégation&quot; that same year.

==Work and political activism==
She often became involved in political action out of sympathy with the working class. In 1915, when she was only six years old, she refused sugar in solidarity with the troops entrenched along the Western Front. In 1919, at 10 years of age, she declared herself a Bolshevik. In her late teens, she became involved in the workers&#x27; movement. She wrote political tracts, marched in demonstrations and advocated workers&#x27; rights. At this time, she was a Marxist, pacifist and trade unionist.

=== Teaching in Le Puy ===
While teaching in Le Puy, she became involved in local political activity, supporting local striking workers underpaid by the City Council. Weil joined protest marches with them and even shared wine with them, facing criticism from local elites and an antisemitic attack in a local paper. When the school director called Weil in for questioning, students and coworkers rallied behind her and ultimately the city council raised the pay of the workers. Weil often held classes outdoors, often refused to share grades with school leadership, and is said to have created a &quot;family atmosphere&quot;. She also traveled weekly to Saint-Étienne to teach workers French literature, believing literature could be a tool for revolution and give workers ownership over their heritage and revolution.

=== Factory work and travels ===
Weil began to feel her work was too narrow and elite, telling her students it was an error to &quot;reason in place of finding out&quot; and that philosophy was a matter of action based in truth and that truth must be based in something (something lived or experienced). This led Weil to leave Le Puy to work in factories and perform the repetitive, machine-like work that underlay her definition of &quot;le malheur&quot; (affliction), saying that workers were reduced to a machine-like existence, where they could not consider rebellion.

Weil never formally joined the French Communist Party, and in her twenties she became increasingly critical of Marxism. According to Pétrement, she was one of the first to identify a new form of oppression not anticipated by Marx, where élite bureaucrats could make life just as miserable for ordinary people as did the most exploitative capitalists. Weil critiqued Marxist theorists, stating &quot;they themselves have never been cogs in the machinery of factory&quot;. Weil also doubted aspects of revolution, stating revolution is a word for &quot;which you kill, for which you die, for which you send the laboring masses to their death, but which does not possess any content&quot;. Weil felt oppression was not limited to any particular division of labor, but flows from &quot;la puissance&quot; or power, which affects all people.

In 1932, Weil visited Germany to help Marxist activists, who were at the time considered to be the strongest and best organised communists in Western Europe, but Weil considered them no match for the up-and-coming fascists. When she returned to France, her political friends there dismissed her fears, thinking Germany would continue to be controlled by the centrists or by those to the left. After Hitler rose to power in the beginning of 1933, Weil spent much of her time trying to help German communists fleeing his regime. Weil would sometimes publish articles about social and economic issues, including &quot;Oppression and Liberty,&quot; as well as numerous short articles for trade union journals. This work criticised popular Marxist thought and gave a pessimistic account of the limits of both capitalism and socialism. The work however uses a Marxist method of analysis: paying attention to oppression, critiquing Weil&#x27;s own position as an intellectual, and advances both manual labor and theory and practice. Leon Trotsky personally responded to several of her articles, attacking both her ideas and her as a person. However, according to Pétrement, he was influenced by some of Weil&#x27;s thought.

In 1933, Weil was dismissed from a teaching job in Auxerre and transferred to Roanne. Weil participated in the French general strike of 1933, called to protest against unemployment and wage cuts. The following year, she took a 12-month leave of absence from her teaching position to work incognito as a labourer in two factories, one owned by Alstom and one by Renault, believing that this experience would allow her to connect with the working class. 

In 1935, she began teaching in Bourges and started &quot;Entre Nous&quot;, a journal that was produced and written by factory workers. Weil donated most of her income to political causes and charitable endeavours.

=== Participation in Spanish Civil War ===
Weil participated in the 1936 Paris factory occupations and planned on returning to factory work In 1936, but became focused on the Spanish Civil War. Despite her professed pacifism, she travelled to Spain to join the Republican faction. She identified as an anarchist and sought out the anti-fascist commander Julián Gorkin, asking to be sent on a mission as a covert agent to rescue the prisoner Joaquín Maurín. Gorkin refused, saying Weil would be sacrificing herself for nothing, since it was highly unlikely that she could pass as a Spaniard. Weil replied that she had &quot;every right&quot; to sacrifice herself if she chose, but after arguing for more than an hour, she was unable to convince Gorkin to give her the assignment. Instead she joined the anarchist Durruti Column of the French-speaking Sébastien Faure Century, which specialised in high-risk &quot;commando&quot;-style engagements. 

As she was extremely nearsighted, Weil was a very poor shot. Her comrades tried to avoid taking her on missions, though she did sometimes insist. Her only direct participation in combat was to shoot with her rifle at a bomber during an air raid; in a second raid, she tried to operate the group&#x27;s heavy machine gun, but her comrades prevented her, as they thought it would be best for someone less clumsy and near-sighted to use the weapon. After being with the group for a few weeks, she burnt herself over a cooking fire. 

She was forced to leave the unit and was met by her parents, who had followed her to Spain. They helped her leave the country, to recuperate in Assisi. About a month after Weil departed, her former unit was nearly wiped out at an engagement in Perdiguera in October 1936, with every woman in the group being killed. During her stay in the Aragon front, Weil sent some chronicles to the French publication &quot;Le Libertaire&quot;. On returning to Paris, she continued to write essays on labour, on management, war and peace. 

Weil was distressed by the Republican killings in eastern Spain, particularly when a fifteen-year-old Falangist was executed after he had been taken prisoner. Durruti had spent an hour trying to persuade him to change his political position before giving him until the next day to decide. Weil was deeply concerned by the intoxication of war, where humans learn they can kill without punishment, stating &quot;I was horrified, but not surprised by the war crimes. I felt the possibility of doing the same - and it&#x27;s precisely because I felt I had that potential that I was horrified.&quot;

=== Marseille ===
After the rise of Nazi Germany, Weil renounced pacifism. She said that, &quot;non-violence is good only if it&#x27;s effective,&quot; and she became committed to fighting the Nazi regime, even if it required force. After German attacks on France, Weil left Paris with her family and fled to Marseille. Weil began the risky work of delivering the &quot;Cahiers du témoignage,&quot; a resistance paper. The resistance group of which Weil was part was infiltrated by informants, and Weil was questioned by the police. When the police threatened to jail her “with the whores” if she did not give them information, Weil stated she would welcome the invitation to be jailed. Weil was ultimately never arrested. Marseille is also where Weil would soon develop significant religious relationships, receiving spiritual direction from Fr. Joseph-Marie Perrin, a Dominican Friar. Weil met the French Catholic author Gustave Thibon, who owned a farm in the Ardéche region where Weil would later work the grape harvest. Thibon later edited some of her work, helping to draw attention to her spiritually related thought in the English-speaking world. Weil encouraged her parents to buy a farm in the Ardèche where they could sustain themselves and work, but Weil&#x27;s family thought it safer to plan to move to the United States.

==Encounters with mysticism==
Weil was born into a secular household and raised in &quot;complete agnosticism&quot;. As a teenager, she considered the existence of God for herself and decided nothing could be known either way. In her &quot;Spiritual Autobiography&quot;, however, Weil records that she always had a Christian outlook, taking to heart from her earliest childhood the idea of loving one&#x27;s neighbour. 

Weil was attracted to the Christian faith beginning in 1935, when she had the first of three pivotal religious experiences: being moved by the beauty of villagers singing hymns in a procession she stumbled across while on holiday to Portugal (in Póvoa de Varzim). Weil the later wrote &quot;the conviction was suddenly borne in upon her that Christianity is pre-eminently the religion of slaves, that slaves cannot help belonging to it, and she among others.&quot; 

While in Assisi during the spring of 1937, Weil experienced a religious ecstasy in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli—the same church in which Saint Francis of Assisi had prayed. She was led to pray for the first time in her life as Lawrence S. Cunningham relates:
Below the town is the beautiful church and convent of San Damiano where Saint Clare once lived. Near that spot is the place purported to be where Saint Francis composed the larger part of his &quot;Canticle of Brother Sun&quot;. Below the town in the valley is the ugliest church in the entire environs: the massive baroque basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels, finished in the seventeenth century and rebuilt in the nineteenth century, which houses a rare treasure: a tiny Romanesque chapel that stood in the days of Saint Francis—the &quot;Little Portion&quot; where he would gather his brethren. It was in that tiny chapel that the great mystic Simone Weil first felt compelled to kneel down and pray.

Weil had a third, more powerful, revelation a year later while reciting George Herbert&#x27;s poem &quot;Love III&quot;, after which &quot;Christ himself came down and took possession of me&quot;, and, from 1938 on, her writings became more mystical and spiritual, while retaining their focus on social and political issues. In 1938 Weil visited the Benedictine Solesmes Abbey and while suffering from headaches she found pure joy in Gregorian chant that she felt the &quot;possibility of living divine love in the midst of affliction&quot;.

She was attracted to Catholicism, but declined to be baptized at that time, preferring to remain outside due to &quot;the love of those things that are outside Christianity&quot;. While deeply religious, Weil was skeptical of the Church and dogma as an institution stating &quot;I have not the slightest love for the Church in the strict sense of the word&quot; and was appalled by the concept of &quot;Anathema Sit&quot; as she refused to separate herself from unbelievers. Weil felt that humility is incompatible with belonging to a social group &quot;chosen by God&quot; no matter if that group is a nation or a Church.

Weil did not limit her curiosity to Christianity. She was interested in other religious traditions—especially the Greek and Egyptian mysteries; Hinduism (especially the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita); and Mahayana Buddhism. She believed that all these and other traditions contained elements of genuine revelation, writing:
Greece, Egypt, ancient India, the beauty of the world, the pure and authentic reflection of this beauty in art and science...these things have done as much as the visibly Christian ones to deliver me into Christ&#x27;s hands as his captive. I think I might even say more.

Nevertheless, Weil was opposed to religious syncretism, claiming that it effaced the particularity of the individual traditions:
Each religion is alone true, that is to say, that at the moment we are thinking of it we must bring as much attention to bear on it as if there were nothing else ... A &quot;synthesis&quot; of religion implies a lower quality of attention.

==Later years==

In 1942, Weil travelled to the United States with her family. She had been reluctant to leave France, but agreed to do so as she wanted to see her parents to safety and knew they would not leave without her. She was also encouraged by the fact that it would be relatively easy for her to reach Britain from the United States, where she could join the French Resistance. She had hopes of being sent back to France as a covert agent.

Older biographies suggest Weil made no further progress in achieving her desire to return to France as an agent—she was limited to desk work in London analyzing reports from resistance movements, although this did give her time to write one of her largest and best known works: &quot;The Need for Roots&quot;. During this time Weil would also write &quot;Draft for a Statement of Human Obligations&quot; and &quot;Note on the General Suppression of Political Parties.&quot;

Yet there is now evidence that Weil was recruited by the Special Operations Executive, with a view to sending her back to France as a clandestine wireless operator. In May 1943, preparations were underway to send her to Thame Park in Oxfordshire for training, but the plan was cancelled soon after, as her failing health became known.
Weil wrote furiously during this period sending a plethora of proposals though she was frustrated by feeling she was too safe and not doing enough to address the suffering. De Gaulle rejected her plans and forces were not willing to send her back to France to join the resistance more directly.

The rigorous work routine she assumed soon took a heavy toll. Weil was found slumped on the floor of her apartment, emaciated and exhausted. In 1943, Weil was diagnosed with tuberculosis and instructed to rest and eat well. However, she refused special treatment because of her long-standing political idealism and her detachment from material things. Instead, she limited her intake to what she believed residents of German-occupied France ate. She most likely ate even less, as she refused on most occasions. It is possible that she was baptized during this period. Her condition quickly deteriorated and she was moved to a sanatorium at Grosvenor Hall in Ashford, Kent.

==Death==
After a lifetime of battling illness and frailty, Weil died in August 1943 from cardiac failure at the age of 34. The coroner&#x27;s report said that &quot;the deceased did kill and slay herself by refusing to eat whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed&quot;.

The exact cause of her death remains a subject of debate. Some claim that her refusal to eat came from her desire to express some form of solidarity toward the victims of the war. Others think that Weil&#x27;s self-starvation occurred after her study of Arthur Schopenhauer. In his chapters on Christian saintly asceticism and salvation, Schopenhauer had described self-starvation as a preferred method of self-denial. However, Simone Pétrement, one of Weil&#x27;s first and most significant biographers, regards the coroner&#x27;s report as simply mistaken. Basing her opinion on letters written by the personnel of the sanatorium at which Simone Weil was treated, Pétrement affirms that Weil asked for food on different occasions while she was hospitalized and even ate a little bit a few days before her death; according to her, it was, in fact, Weil&#x27;s poor health condition that eventually made her unable to eat.

Weil&#x27;s first English biographer, Richard Rees, offers several possible explanations for her death, citing her compassion for the suffering of her countrymen in occupied France and her love for and close imitation of Christ. Rees sums up by saying: &quot;As for her death, whatever explanation one may give of it will amount in the end to saying that she died of love.&quot;

==Philosophy==
=== Absence ===
Absence is the key image for her metaphysics, cosmology, cosmogony, and theodicy. She believed that God created by an act of self-delimitation—in other words, she argued that because God is conceived as utter fullness, a perfect being, no creature can exist except where God is not. Thus, creation occurred only when God withdrew in part. This idea mirrors tzimtzum, a central notion in the Jewish Kabbalah creation narrative.

This is, for Weil, an original &quot;kenosis&quot; (&quot;emptiness&quot;) preceding the corrective &quot;kenosis&quot; of Christ&#x27;s incarnation. Thus, according to her, humans are born in a damned position, not because of original sin, but because to be created at all they must be what God is not; in other words, they must be inherently &quot;unholy&quot; in some sense. This idea fits more broadly into apophatic theology. 

This notion of creation is a cornerstone of her theodicy, for if creation is conceived this wayas necessarily entailing evilthen there is no problem of the entrance of evil into a perfect world. Nor does the presence of evil constitute a limitation of God&#x27;s omnipotence under Weil&#x27;s notion; according to her, evil is present not because God could not create a perfect world, but because the act of &quot;creation&quot; in its very essence implies the impossibility of perfection.

However, this explanation of the essentiality of evil does not imply that humans are simply, originally, and continually doomed; on the contrary, Weil claims that &quot;evil is the form which God&#x27;s mercy takes in this world&quot;. Weil believed that evil, and its consequent affliction, serve the role of driving humans towards God, writing, &quot;The extreme affliction which overtakes human beings does not create human misery, it merely reveals it.&quot;

=== Affliction ===

Weil developed the concept of &quot;affliction&quot; () while working in factories with workers reduced to a machine-like existence where they could not consider real thought or rebellion with Weil stating &quot;thought flies from affliction as promptly and irresistibly as an animal flees from death&quot;. Weil found this force too inhumane stating &quot;affliction constrains a man to ask continually &#x27;why&#x27; - the question to which there is essentially no reply&quot; and nothing in the world can rob us of the power to say &#x27;I&#x27; except for extreme affliction&quot;.

According to her, only some souls are capable of experiencing the full depth of afflictionthe same souls that are also most able to experience spiritual joy. Weil&#x27;s notion of affliction is a sort of &quot;suffering plus&quot; which transcends both body and mind, a physical and mental anguish that scourges the very soul.

=== &quot;Decreation&quot; ===
In &quot;Waiting for God&quot; Weil outlines the concept of decreation. Weil believed that if humans are to imitate God they must renounce their power and their autonomy. Weil refers to this as decreation (&quot;décréation)&quot; which she referred to as &quot;passive activity&quot; or based on her childhood readings of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, “non-active action”. 

Weil&#x27;s concept of necessity related to decreation. Weil felt that necessity includes physical forces as well as social forces. Weil felt that when an individual is self-centred they deny necessity. Consent to necessity means the only choice is whether or not they desire the good. For Weil, this type of consent is obtained metaphysically through decreation rather than through effort.

=== &quot;Metaxu&quot;: &quot;Every separation is a link&quot; ===
&quot;Metaxu&quot;, a concept Weil borrowed from Plato, is that which both separates and connects (e.g., as the word &#x27;cleave&#x27; means both to cut and join). This idea of connecting distance was of the first importance for Weil&#x27;s understanding of the created realm. The world as a whole, along with any of its components, including the physical body, is to be regarded as serving the same function for people in relation to God that a blind man&#x27;s stick serves for him in relation to the world about him. They do not afford direct insight, but can be used experimentally to bring the mind into practical contact with reality. This metaphor allows any absence to be interpreted as a presence, and is a further component in Weil&#x27;s theodicy. 

In &quot;Gravity and Grace&quot; Weil provides a metaphor to explain this concept &quot;Two prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by knocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but it is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and God. Every separation is a link.&quot;

=== Beauty ===

For Weil, &quot;The beautiful is the experiential proof that the incarnation is possible&quot;. The beauty that is inherent in the form of the world (this inherency is proven, for her, in geometry, and expressed in all good art) is the proof that the world points to something beyond itself; it establishes the essentially telic character of all that exists. In Weil&#x27;s concept, beauty extends throughout the universe: &quot;[W]e must have faith that the universe is beautiful on all levels...and that it has a fullness of beauty in relation to the bodily and psychic structure of each of the thinking beings that actually do exist and of all those that are possible. It is this very agreement of an infinity of perfect beauties that gives a transcendent character to the beauty of the world...He (Christ) is really present in the universal beauty. The love of this beauty proceeds from God dwelling in our souls and goes out to God present in the universe&quot;. She also wrote that &quot;The beauty of this world is Christ&#x27;s tender smile coming to us through matter&quot;.

Beauty also served a soteriological function for Weil: &quot;Beauty captivates the flesh in order to obtain permission to pass right to the soul.&quot; It constitutes, then, another way in which the divine reality behind the world invades people&#x27;s lives: where affliction conquers with brute force, beauty sneaks in and topples the empire of the self from within.

=== Philosophy in &quot;Waiting for God&quot; ===

==== Attention ====
As Weil explains in her book &quot;Waiting for God&quot;, attention consists of suspending or emptying one&#x27;s thought, such that one is ready to receive—to be penetrated by—the object to which one turns one&#x27;s gaze, be that object one&#x27;s neighbour, or ultimately, God. Weil states that &quot;the capacity to give one&#x27;s attention to a sufferer is a very rare and difficult thing: it is almost a miracle; it &quot;is&quot; a miracle&quot;. Attention may be linked to compassion so that, with attention, one can identify with an afflicted individual letting go of ourselves and allowing the other person to have our attention. Weil contrasts this attention with pity describing pity as &quot;it consists in helping someone in misfortune so as not to be obligated to think about him anymore, or for the pleasure of feeling distance between himself and oneself&quot;.

As Weil explains, one can love God by praying to God, and attention is the very &quot;substance of prayer&quot;: when one prays, one empties oneself, fixes one&#x27;s whole gaze towards God, and becomes ready to receive God. Similarly, for Weil, people can love their neighbours by emptying themselves, becoming ready to receive one&#x27;s neighbour in all their naked truth, asking one&#x27;s neighbour: &quot;What are you going through?&quot; 

Weil further equates aspects of attention to love stating &quot;To empty ourselves (French: &quot;Se vider)&quot; of our false divinity, to deny ourselves, to give up being the center of the world in imagination, to discern that all points in the world are equally centers and that the true center is outside the world, this is to consent to the rule of mechanical necessity in matter and of free choice at the center of each soul. Such consent is love. The face of this love, which is turned toward thinking persons, is the love of our neighbor.&quot; 

==== Three Forms of the Implicit Love of God ====
In &quot;Waiting for God&quot;, Weil explains that the three forms of implicit love of God are (1) love of neighbour (2) love of the beauty of the world and (3) love of religious ceremonies. As Weil writes, by loving these three objects (neighbour, world&#x27;s beauty and religious ceremonies), one indirectly loves God before &quot;God comes in person to take the hand of his future bride,&quot; since prior to God&#x27;s arrival, one&#x27;s soul cannot yet &quot;directly&quot; love God as the object. Love of neighbour occurs (i) when the strong treat the weak &quot;as equals,&quot; (ii) when people give personal attention to those that otherwise seem invisible, anonymous, or non-existent, and (iii) when people look at and listen to the afflicted &quot;as they are&quot;, without explicitly thinking about God—i.e., Weil writes, when &quot;God in us&quot; loves the afflicted, &quot;rather&quot; than people loving them in God. Second, Weil explains, love of the world&#x27;s beauty occurs when humans imitate God&#x27;s love for the cosmos: just as God creatively renounced his command over the world—letting it be ruled by human autonomy and matter&#x27;s &quot;blind necessity&quot;—humans give up their imaginary command over the world, seeing the world &quot;no longer&quot; as if they were the world&#x27;s center. Finally, Weil explains, love of religious ceremonies occurs as an implicit love of God, when religious practices are pure. Weil writes that purity in religion is seen when &quot;faith and love do not fail,&quot; and most absolutely, in the Eucharist.

==Works==
According to Lissa McCullough, Weil would likely have been &quot;intensely displeased&quot; by the attention paid to her life rather than her works. She believed it was her writings that embodied the best of her, not her actions and definitely not her personality. Weil had similar views about others, saying that if one looks at the lives of great figures in separation from their works, it &quot;necessarily ends up revealing their pettiness above all&quot;, as it&#x27;s in their works that they have put the best of themselves.

Weil&#x27;s most famous works were published posthumously.
::In the decades since her death, her writings have been assembled, annotated, criticized, discussed, disputed, and praised. Along with some twenty volumes of her works, publishers have issued more than thirty biographies, including &quot;Simone Weil: A Modern Pilgrimage&quot; by Robert Coles, Harvard&#x27;s Pulitzer-winning professor, who calls Weil &#x27;a giant of reflection.&#x27;

=== &quot;The Iliad, or The Poem of Force&quot; ===
Weil wrote &quot;The Iliad, or The Poem of Force&quot; (), a 24-page essay, in 1939 in Marseilles among thousands of refugees fleeing Nazi-occupied France. First published in 1940 in &quot;Les Cahiers du Sud&quot;, the only significant literary magazine available in the French free zone. It is still commonly used in university courses on the Classics.

The essay focuses on the theme that Weil calls &#x27;Force&#x27; in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, which she defines as &quot;that &quot;x&quot; which turns anyone subjected to it into a &quot;thing&quot;.&quot; In the opening sentences of the essay, she sets out her view of the role of Force in the poem:
The true hero, the true subject, the centre of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, is force. Force employed by man, force that enslaves man, force before which man&#x27;s flesh shrinks away. In this work, at all times, the human spirit is shown as modified by its relations with force, as swept away, blinded, by the very force it imagined it could handle, as deformed by the weight of the force it submits to.
&quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; has described the essay as one of Weil&#x27;s most celebrated works, while it has also been described as among &quot;the twentieth century&#x27;s most beloved, tortured, and profound responses to the world&#x27;s greatest and most disturbing poem.&quot;

Simone Petrement, a friend of Weil&#x27;s, wrote that the essay portrayed the &quot;Iliad&quot; as an accurate and compassionate depiction of how both victors and victims are harmed by the use of force.

The essay contains several extracts from the epic which Weil translated herself from the original Greek; Petrement records how Weil took over half an hour per line.

===&quot;The Need for Roots&quot;===
Weil&#x27;s book &quot;The Need for Roots&quot; () was written in early 1943, immediately before her death later that year. In it Weil presents a morality based on compassion rather than the rule of law. At this time Weil was in London working for the French Resistance and trying to convince its leader, Charles de Gaulle, to form a contingent of nurses, including Weil, who would parachute to the front lines. Weil&#x27;s intention was partially for these nurses to provide care, but also to offer an inspiring moral opposite to Nazism with Weil stating &quot;it may be that our victory depends upon the presence among us of a corresponding inspiration, but authentic and pure&quot;. 

&quot;The Need for Roots&quot; has an ambitious plan. It sets out to address the past and to propose a road map for the future of France after World War II. She painstakingly analyzes the spiritual and ethical milieu that led to France&#x27;s defeat by the German army, and then addresses these issues with the prospect of eventual French victory.

==== Obligations vs Rights ====
Weil felt that &quot;all human beings are bound by identical obligations, although they are performed in different ways according to particular circumstances.&quot; and that &quot;duty to the human being as such - that alone is eternal&quot;. Weil differentiates between rights and obligations viewing the two as subject and object. &quot;The actual relationship between the two is as between object and subject. A man, considered in isolation, only has duties, amongst which are certain duties towards himself. Other men, seen from his point of view, only have rights. He, in his turn, has rights, when seen from the point of view of other men, who recognize that they have obligations towards him. A man left alone in the universe would have no rights whatever, but he would have obligations.&quot; Weil elaborates supporting the idea that obligations alone are independent stating &quot;rights are always found to be related to certain conditions. Obligations alone remain independent of conditions.&quot; with obligations being a universal condition &quot;All human beings are bound by identical obligations, although these are performed in different ways according to particular circumstances.&quot; whereas rights are conditional &quot;...a right is not effectual by itself, but only in relation to the obligation to which it corresponds&quot;. 

==== Defining roots ====
In this work Weil makes the case for roots or the idea that the persistence of people is tied to the persistence of their culture, their way of life, as carried through generations&quot;.&quot; For Weil roots involved obligations to participate in community life, feel connected to place, and maintain links through time. The &quot;roots&quot; Weil refers to are nourishment that enable humans to fully grow and that a rooted community allows the individual to develop with a view toward God or eternal values.

In contrast, a threat to the human soul is uprootedness (&quot;déracinement&quot;) is the condition of people where the only binding forces in society are money and the imagined nation. For industrial working conditions Weil states &quot;although they have remained geographically stationary, they have been morally uprooted, banished and the reinstated as it were on sufferance, in the form of industrial brawn&quot;. Weil states that &quot;money destroys human roots wherever it is able to penetrate&quot; and it &quot;manages to outweigh all other motives because the effort it demands of the mind is so much less...&quot;. 

Weil opposed behavior that uprooted people including colonialism (including the French empire), some forms of mass media, and poor industrial working conditions. Weil did not excuse moral issues within a place, stating countries are a vital medium but one with good and evil and justice and injustice. Weil wrote passionately against the French government&#x27;s colonial policies including the &quot;mission civilisatrice&quot; stating &quot;we can no longer say or think that we have received from on high the mission to teach the universe how to live.&quot; though Weil also opposed the creation of new nations based on the European model stating &quot;there are already too many nations in the world&quot; 

==== Patriotism of Compassion ====
Weil was also not opposed to patriotism but saw it rooted not in pride but instead in compassion and that this compassion, unlike pride, can be extended to other nations stating compassion is &quot;able, without hindrance, to cross frontiers extend itself over all countries in misfortune, overall countries without exception for all peoples are subjected to the wretchedness of the human condition&quot;.

===&quot;Gravity and Grace&quot;===
While &quot;Gravity and Grace&quot; () is one of the books most associated with Simone Weil, the work was not intended to be a book at all. Rather, the work consists of various passages selected from Weil&#x27;s notebooks and arranged topically by her friend Gustave Thibon. Weil had given Thibon some of her notebooks written before May 1942, but not with any intent to publish them. Hence, the resulting selections, organization and editing of &quot;Gravity and Grace&quot; were much influenced by Thibon, a devout Catholic (see Thibon&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Gravity and Grace&quot; (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1952) for more details).

Weil felt gravity and grace were opposites believing that gravity signifies the &quot;force&quot; of the natural world of which all beings are physically, materially, and socially affected and that this &quot;pulls&quot; attention away from God and the afflicted whereas grace is a form of justice and a counter-balance, motivated by the goodness of God. Weil felt that this gravity (force) and grace (justice) are the two most fundamental aspects of the world and came together at the crucifixion.

==Legacy==

During her lifetime, Weil was known only in relatively narrow circles and even in France her essays were mostly read only by those interested in radical politics. During the first decade after her death, Weil rapidly became famous, attracting attention throughout the West. For the third quarter of the 20th century, she was widely regarded as the most influential person in the world on new work concerning religious and spiritual matters. Her philosophical, social and political thought also became popular, although not to the same degree as her religious work.

Aside from influencing various fields of study, Weil deeply affected the personal lives of numerous individuals. Pope Paul VI said that Weil was one of his three greatest influences. Weil is also cited as an influence by Iris Murdoch, Jacques Derrida, Albert Camus, Franz Fanon, Emmanuel Levinas, George Grant, Adrienne Rich, Jacqueline Rose, and Thomas Merton. Weil&#x27;s popularity began to decline in the late 1960s and 1970s. However, more of her work was gradually published, leading to many thousands of new secondary works by Weil scholars, some of whom focused on achieving a deeper understanding of her religious, philosophical and political work. Others broadened the scope of Weil scholarship to investigate her applicability to fields like classical studies, cultural studies, education, and even technical fields like ergonomics.

Many commentators have given highly positive assessments of Weil as a person; some describe her as a saint, even as the greatest saint of the twentieth century, including T. S. Eliot, Dwight Macdonald, Leslie Fiedler, and Robert Coles. After they met at age 18, Simone de Beauvoir wroteː &quot;I envied her for having a heart that could beat right across the world.&quot; Weil biographer Gabriella Fiori writes that Weil was &quot;a moral genius in the orbit of ethics, a genius of immense revolutionary range.&quot; Maurice Schumann said that since her death there was &quot;hardly a day when the thought of her life did not positively influence his own and serve as a moral guide.&quot; In 1951, Albert Camus wrote that she was &quot;the only great spirit of our times.&quot; Foolish though she may have appeared at times—dropping a suitcase full of French resistance papers all over the sidewalk and scrambling to gather them up—her deep engagement with both the theory and practice of caritas, in all its myriad forms, functions as the unifying force of her life and thought. Gustave Thibon, the French philosopher and Weil&#x27;s close friend, recounts their last meeting, not long before her death: &quot;I will only say that I had the impression of being in the presence of an absolutely transparent soul which was ready to be reabsorbed into original light.&quot; The Routledge edition of &quot;Gravity and Grace&quot; includes a New York Times Book Review stating &quot;‘In France she is ranked with Pascal by some, condemned as a dangerous heretic by others, and recognized as a genius by all.&quot; In 2017 President Emmanuel Macron mentioned Weil and her philosophy in a joint address to Parliament stating the need for what Weil calls &quot;l’effectivité&quot; (effectivity). 

Weil has been criticised, however, even by those who otherwise admired her deeply, such as T. S. Eliot, for being excessively prone to divide the world into good and evil, and for her sometimes intemperate judgments. Weil was a harsh critic of the influence of Judaism on Western civilisation. However, her niece Sylvie Weil and biographer Thomas R. Nevin argue that Weil did not reject Judaism and was heavily influenced by its precepts. Weil was an even harsher critic of the Roman Empire, in which she refused to see any value. On the other hand, according to Eliot, she held up the Cathars as exemplars of goodness, despite there being in his view little concrete evidence on which to base such an assessment. According to Pétrement she idolised Lawrence of Arabia, considering him to be a saint. A few critics have taken an overall negative view. Several Jewish writers, including Susan Sontag, have accused her of antisemitism, although this perspective is far from universal. A small minority of commentators have judged her to be psychologically unbalanced or sexually obsessed. General Charles de Gaulle, her ultimate boss while she worked for the &quot;French Resistance&quot;, considered her &quot;insane&quot;, although even he was influenced by her and repeated some of her sayings for years after her death.

A meta study from the University of Calgary maintains a bibliography of more than 5,000 books, essays, journal articles, and theses about Weil and her work. Together French and English comprise slightly over 50% of the total records collected. Other organizations dedicated to her work include Association pour l&#x27;Étude de la Pensée de Simone Weil and the American Weil Society.

== Weil in film, stage, and media ==
&quot;Approaching Simone&quot; is a play created by Megan Terry. Dramatizing the life, philosophy and death of Simone Weil, Terry&#x27;s play won the 1969/1970 Obie Award for Best Off-Broadway Play.

Weil was the subject of a 2010 documentary by Julia Haslett, &quot;An encounter with Simone Weil&quot;. Haslett noted that Weil had become &quot;a little-known figure, practically forgotten in her native France, and rarely taught in universities or secondary schools&quot;.

Weil was also the subject of Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho&#x27;s &quot;La Passion de Simone&quot; (2008), written with librettist Amin Maalouf.

Chris Kraus&#x27; 1996 film &quot;Gravity and Grace&quot; alludes to the posthumous work of Simone Weil. Chris Kraus&#x27; 2000 novel &quot;Aliens &amp; Anorexia&quot; chronicles her experience producing the film while also touching on Kraus&#x27; personal study and interaction with Simone Weil&#x27;s philosophy and life. 

Weil&#x27;s work, &quot;Venice Saved,&quot; was not completed in her lifetime but put together as a play and translated by Silvia Panizza and Philip Wilson. 

T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Czeslaw Milosz, Seamus Heaney, Flannery O’Connor, Susan Sontag, Octavia Bright, Anne Carson, Adrienne Rich, Annie Dillard, Mary Gordon, Maggie Helwig, Stephanie Strickland, Kate Daniels, Sarah Klassen and Lorri Neilsen Glennall cite Weil as an inspiration of their books and literature. 

Clancy, a character from Twenty One Pilots’ albums Trench, Scaled and Icy, and Clancy reflects themes inspired by the French philosopher Simone Weil. Like Weil, who critiqued oppression and explored the quest for spiritual freedom, Clancy&#x27;s journey through the oppressive city of Dema, ruled by tyrannical bishops, mirrors Weil&#x27;s critiques of oppressive systems and her emphasis on the quest for spiritual freedom. The connection is further highlighted by the leader of Dema, Nico, a reference to Nicolas Bourbaki, a pseudonym linked to Weil&#x27;s brother, André Weil. Additionally, the bishops’ religion, Vialism, pronounced similarly to &quot;Weilism,&quot; hints at a direct homage to Simone Weil, underscoring the album&#x27;s exploration of suffering, awareness, and the search for truth, key themes in Weil&#x27;s work.

<text>Anticonvulsants (also known as antiepileptic drugs, antiseizure drugs, or anti-seizure medications (ASM)) are a diverse group of pharmacological agents used in the treatment of epileptic seizures. Anticonvulsants are also increasingly being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, since many seem to act as mood stabilizers, and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Anticonvulsants suppress the excessive rapid firing of neurons during seizures. Anticonvulsants also prevent the spread of the seizure within the brain.

Conventional antiepileptic drugs may block sodium channels or enhance γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function. Several antiepileptic drugs have multiple or uncertain mechanisms of action. Next to the voltage-gated sodium channels and components of the GABA system, their targets include GABAA receptors, the GABA transporter type 1, and GABA transaminase. Additional targets include voltage-gated calcium channels, SV2A, and α2δ. By blocking sodium or calcium channels, antiepileptic drugs reduce the release of excitatory glutamate, whose release is considered to be elevated in epilepsy, but also that of GABA. This is probably a side effect or even the actual mechanism of action for some antiepileptic drugs, since GABA can itself, directly or indirectly, act proconvulsively. Another potential target of antiepileptic drugs is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha.

Some anticonvulsants have shown antiepileptogenic effects in animal models of epilepsy. That is, they either prevent the development of epilepsy or can halt or reverse the progression of epilepsy. However, no drug has been shown in human trials to prevent epileptogenesis (the development of epilepsy in an individual at risk, such as after a head injury).

Many anticonvulsants are known teratogens and increase the risk of birth defects in the unborn child if taken while pregnant. 

== Terminology ==
Anticonvulsants are more accurately called antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) because not every epileptic seizure involves convulsion, and vice versa, not every convulsion is caused by an epileptic seizure. They are also often referred to as antiseizure drugs because they provide symptomatic treatment only and have not been demonstrated to alter the course of epilepsy.

== Approval ==

The usual method of achieving approval for a drug is to show it is effective when compared against placebo, or that it is more effective than an existing drug. In monotherapy (where only one drug is taken) it is considered unethical by most to conduct a trial with placebo on a new drug of uncertain efficacy. This is because untreated epilepsy leaves the patient at significant risk of death. Therefore, almost all new epilepsy drugs are initially approved only as adjunctive (add-on) therapies. Patients whose epilepsy is uncontrolled by their medication (i.e., it is refractory to treatment) are selected to see if supplementing the medication with the new drug leads to an improvement in seizure control. Any reduction in the frequency of seizures is compared against a placebo. The lack of superiority over existing treatment, combined with lacking placebo-controlled trials, means that few modern drugs have earned FDA approval as initial monotherapy. In contrast, Europe only requires equivalence to existing treatments and has approved many more. Despite their lack of FDA approval, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society still recommend a number of these new drugs as initial monotherapy.

== Drugs ==
In the following list, the dates in parentheses are the earliest approved use of the drug.

=== Aldehydes ===

* Paraldehyde (1882). One of the earliest anticonvulsants. It is still used to treat status epilepticus, particularly where there are no resuscitation facilities.

=== Aromatic allylic alcohols ===
* Stiripentol (2007). Indicated for the treatment of Dravet syndrome.

=== Barbiturates ===

Barbiturates are drugs that act as central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and by virtue of this they produce a wide spectrum of effects, from mild sedation to anesthesia. The following are classified as anticonvulsants:
* Phenobarbital (1912). See also the related drug primidone.
* Methylphenobarbital (1935). Known as mephobarbital in the US. No longer marketed in the UK.
* Barbexaclone (1982). Only available in some European countries.

=== Benzodiazepines ===

The benzodiazepines are a class of drugs with hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsive, amnestic and muscle relaxant properties. Benzodiazepines act as a central nervous system depressant. The relative strength of each of these properties in any given benzodiazepine varies greatly and influences the indications for which it is prescribed. Long-term use can be problematic due to the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects and dependency. Of many drugs in this class, only a few are used to treat epilepsy:
* Clobazam (1979). Notably, used on a short-term basis around menstruation in women with catamenial epilepsy.
* Clonazepam (1974).
* Clorazepate (1972).

The following benzodiazepines are used to treat status epilepticus:
* Diazepam (1963). Can be given rectally by trained care-givers.
* Midazolam (N/A). Increasingly being used as an alternative to diazepam. This water-soluble drug is squirted into the side of the mouth but not swallowed. It is rapidly absorbed by the buccal mucosa.
* Lorazepam (1972). Given by injection in hospital.

Nitrazepam, temazepam, and especially nimetazepam are powerful anticonvulsant agents, however their use is rare due to an increased incidence of side effects and strong sedative and motor-impairing properties.

=== Bromides ===

* Potassium bromide (1857). The earliest effective treatment for epilepsy. There would not be a better drug until phenobarbital in 1912. It is still used as an anticonvulsant for dogs and cats but is no longer used in humans.

=== Carbamates ===

* Felbamate (1993). This effective anticonvulsant has had its usage severely restricted due to rare but life-threatening side effects.
* Cenobamate (2019).

=== Carboxamides ===
The following are carboxamides:
* Carbamazepine (1963). A popular anticonvulsant that is available in generic formulations.
* Oxcarbazepine (1990). A derivative of carbamazepine that has similar efficacy and is better tolerated and is also available generically.
* Eslicarbazepine acetate (2009).
* Photoswitchable analogues of carbamazepine (2024) are research compounds developed to control its pharmacological activity locally and on demand using light, with the purpose to reduce adverse systemic effects. One of these compounds (carbadiazocine, based on a bridged azobenzene) has been shown to produce analgesia with noninvasive illumination in a rat model of neuropathic pain.

=== Fatty acids ===

The following are fatty-acids:
* The valproates — valproic acid, sodium valproate, and divalproex sodium (1967).
* Vigabatrin (1989).
* Progabide (1987).
* Tiagabine (1996).

&quot;Vigabatrin and progabide are also analogs of GABA.&quot;

=== Fructose derivatives ===

* Topiramate (1995).

=== Gabapentinoids ===


Gabapentinoids are used in epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, opioid withdrawal and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Gabapentinoids block voltage-gated calcium channels, mainly the N-Type, and P/Q-type calcium channels. The following are gabapentinoids:
* Pregabalin (2004)
* Mirogabalin (2019) (Japan only)
* Gabapentin (1993)
* Gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant) (2011)
* Gabapentin extended release (Gralise) (1996)

Gabapentinoids are analogs of GABA, but they do not act on GABA receptors. They have analgesic, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic effects.

=== Hydantoins ===

The following are hydantoins:
* Ethotoin (1957).
* Phenytoin (1938).
* Mephenytoin.
* Fosphenytoin (1996).

=== Oxazolidinediones ===

The following are oxazolidinediones:
* Paramethadione.
* Trimethadione (1946).
* Ethadione.

=== Propionates ===

* Beclamide.

=== Pyrimidinediones ===

* Primidone (1952).

=== Pyrrolidines ===

* Brivaracetam (2016).
* Etiracetam.
* Levetiracetam (1999).
* Seletracetam.

=== Succinimides ===

The following are succinimides:
* Ethosuximide (1955).
* Phensuximide.
* Mesuximide.

=== Sulfonamides ===

* Acetazolamide (1953).
* Sultiame.
* Methazolamide.
* Zonisamide (2000).

=== Triazines ===

* Lamotrigine (1990).

=== Ureas ===

* Pheneturide.
* Phenacemide.

=== Valproylamides ===

* Valpromide.
* Valnoctamide.

=== Other ===
* Perampanel.
* Stiripentol.
* Pyridoxine (1939).

== Non-pharmaceutical anticonvulsants ==
The ketogenic diet and vagus nerve stimulation are alternative treatments for epilepsy without the involvement of pharmaceuticals. The ketogenic diet consists of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, and has shown good results in patients whose epilepsy has not responded to medications and who cannot receive surgery. The vagus nerve stimulator is a device that can be implanted into patients with epilepsy, especially that which originates from a specific part of the brain. However, both of these treatment options can cause severe adverse effects. Additionally, while seizure frequency typically decreases, they often do not stop entirely.

== Treatment guidelines ==
According to guidelines by the American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society, mainly based on a major article review in 2004, patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy who require treatment can be initiated on standard anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid/valproate semisodium, phenobarbital, or on the newer anticonvulsants gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine or topiramate. The choice of anticonvulsants depends on individual patient characteristics. Both newer and older drugs are generally equally effective in new onset epilepsy. The newer drugs tend to have fewer side effects. For newly diagnosed partial or mixed seizures, there is evidence for using gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine or topiramate as monotherapy. Lamotrigine can be included in the options for children with newly diagnosed absence seizures.

== History ==
The first anticonvulsant was bromide, suggested in 1857 by the British gynecologist Charles Locock who used it to treat women with &quot;hysterical epilepsy&quot; (probably &quot;catamenial epilepsy&quot;). Bromides are effective against epilepsy, and also cause impotence, which is not related to its anti-epileptic effects. Bromide also suffered from the way it affected behaviour, introducing the idea of the &quot;epileptic personality&quot; which was actually a result of medication. Phenobarbital was first used in 1912 for both its sedative and antiepileptic properties. By the 1930s, the development of animal models in epilepsy research led to the development of phenytoin by Tracy Putnam and H. Houston Merritt, which had the distinct advantage of treating epileptic seizures with less sedation. By the 1970s, a National Institutes of Health initiative, the Anticonvulsant Screening Program, headed by J. Kiffin Penry, served as a mechanism for drawing the interest and abilities of pharmaceutical companies in the development of new anticonvulsant medications.

=== Marketing approval history ===

The following table lists anticonvulsant drugs together with the date their marketing was approved in the US, UK and France. Data for the UK and France are incomplete. The European Medicines Agency approves drugs throughout the European Union. Some of the drugs are no longer marketed.

== Pregnancy ==
Many of the commonly used anticonvulsant/anti-seizure medications (ASMs), such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, gabapentin have been reported to cause an increased risk of birth defects including major congenital malformations such as neural tube defects. The risk of birth defects associated with taking these medications while pregnant may be dependent on the dose and on the timing of gestation (how well developed the baby is). While trying to conceive a child and during pregnancy, medical advice should be followed to optimize the management of the person&#x27;s epilepsy in order to keep the person and the unborn baby safe from epileptic seizures and also ensure that the risk of birth defects due to &quot;in utero&quot; exposure of anticonvulsants is as low as possible. Use of anticonvulsant medications should be carefully monitored during use in pregnancy. For example, since the first trimester is the most susceptible period for fetal development, planning a routine antiepileptic drug dose that is safer for the first trimester could be beneficial to prevent pregnancy complications.

Valproic acid, and its derivatives such as sodium valproate and divalproex sodium, causes cognitive deficit in the child, with an increased dose causing decreased intelligence quotient and use is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (cognitive and behavioral)  in children. On the other hand, evidence is conflicting for carbamazepine regarding any increased risk of congenital physical anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders by intrauterine exposure. Similarly, children exposed lamotrigine or phenytoin in the womb do not seem to differ in their skills compared to those who were exposed to carbamazepine. 

There is inadequate evidence to determine if newborns of women with epilepsy taking anticonvulsants have a substantially increased risk of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.

There is little evidence to suggest that anticonvulsant/ASM exposure through breastmilk has clinical effects on newborns. The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study showed that most blood concentrations in breastfed infants of mothers taking carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproate, levetiracetam, and topiramate were quite low, especially in relationship to the mother&#x27;s level and what the fetal level would have been during pregnancy. (Note: valproic acid is NOT a recommended ASM for people with epilepsy who are considering having children.) 

Infant exposure to newer ASMs (cenobamate, perampanel, brivaracetam, eslicarbazepine, rufinamide, levetiracetam, topiramate, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and vigabatrin) via breastmilk was not associated with negative neurodevelopment (such as lower IQ and autism spectrum disorder) at 36 months.

Several studies that followed children exposed to ASMs during pregnancy showed that a number of widely used ones (including lamotrigine and levetiracetam) carried a low risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (cognitive and behavioral) in children when compared to children born to mothers without epilepsy and children born to mothers taking other anti-seizure medications. Data from several pregnancy registries showed that children exposed to levetiracetam or lamotrigine during pregnancy had the lowest risk of developing major congenital malformations compared to those exposed to other ASMs. The risk of major congenital malformations for children exposed to these ASMs were within the range for children who were not exposed to any ASMs during pregnancy.

People with epilepsy can have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies. However, proper planning and care is essential to minimize the risk of congenital malformations or adverse neurocognitive outcomes for the fetus while maintaining seizure control for the pregnant person with epilepsy. If possible, when planning pregnancy, people with epilepsy should switch to ASMs with the lowest teratogenic risk for major congenital malformations as well as the least risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (e.g., lower IQ or autism spectrum disorder). They should also work with their healthcare providers to identify the lowest effective ASM dosage that will maintain their seizure control while regularly checking medication levels throughout pregnancy.

Data from studies conducted on women taking antiepileptic drugs for non-epileptic reasons, including depression and bipolar disorder, show that if high doses of the drugs are taken during the first trimester of pregnancy then there is the potential of an increased risk of congenital malformations. 

== Research ==
The mechanism of how anticonvulsants cause birth defects is not entirely clear. During pregnancy, the metabolism of many anticonvulsants is affected. There may be an increase in the clearance and resultant decrease in the blood concentration of lamotrigine, phenytoin, and to a lesser extent carbamazepine, and possibly decreases the level of levetiracetam and the active oxcarbazepine metabolite, the monohydroxy derivative. In animal models, several anticonvulsant drugs have been demonstrated to induce neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain.

<text>In astrology, an aspect is an angle that planets make to each other in the horoscope; as well as to the Ascendant, Midheaven, Descendant, Lower Midheaven, and other points of astrological interest. As viewed from Earth, aspects are measured by the angular distance in degrees and minutes of ecliptic longitude between two points. According to astrological tradition, they indicate the timing of transitions and developmental changes in the lives of people and affairs relative to the Earth.

For example, if an astrologer creates a Horoscope that shows the apparent positions of the celestial bodies at the time of a person&#x27;s birth (Natal Chart), and the angular distance between Mars and Venus is 92° ecliptic longitude, the chart is said to have the aspect &quot;Venus Square Mars&quot; with an orb of 2° (i.e., it is 2° away from being an exact Square; a Square being a 90° aspect). The more exact an aspect, the stronger or more dominant it is said to be in shaping character or manifesting change.

With Natal charts, other signs may take precedence over a Sun sign. For example, an Aries may have several other planets in Cancer or Pisces. Therefore, the two latter signs may be more influential.

==History and approach==
In medieval astrology, certain aspects and planets were considered to be either favorable (benefic) or unfavorable (malefic). Modern usage places less emphasis on these fatalistic distinctions. The more modern approach to astrological aspects is exemplified by research on astrological harmonics. In 1619, Johannes Kepler advocates this in his book &quot;Harmonice Mundi&quot;. Thereafter, John Addey was a major proponent. However, even in modern times, aspects are considered to be either easy (60° &quot;Sextile&quot; or
120° &quot;Trine&quot;) or hard (90° &quot;Square&quot; or 180° &quot;Opposition&quot;). Depending on the involved planets, a &quot;Conjunction&quot; (0°, which is a discounting orb) may be in either category.

Easy aspects may be positive, because they enhance opportunity for talent to grow. 
Hard aspects may be negative, because they enhance a challenge where an adjustment must be made to reach balance. Typically, manifestation may occur with a Conjunction, Square or Opposition.

Planets may be considered. Mars and Uranus tend to ignite while Saturn and Neptune inhibit. Whether a planet is direct or retrograde is of great significance. An eclipse of the Sun or Moon is even more significant. The South Node of the Moon denotes innate wisdom from past experience while the North Node denotes karma and evolution.

Astrological Signs may be considered. For example, the fire signs of Aries, Leo and Sagittarius are more compatible with the air signs of Gemini, Libra and Aquarius. The Earth signs of Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn are more compatible with the water signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. The mutable signs of Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces may be flexible. The cardinal signs of Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn may change their mind. The fixed signs of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius may be difficult.

Astrological Houses may be considered.

=== Ptolemaic Aspects===
Since they were defined and used by Ptolemy in the 1st Century AD, the traditional major aspects are sometimes called Ptolemaic Aspects. These aspects are the Conjunction (0°), Sextile (60°), Square (90°), Trine (120°), and Opposition (180°). Major aspects are those that are divisible by 10 and evenly divided in relation to 360° (with the exception of the Semisextile and the Novile).

When calculating or using aspects, it is important to note that different astrologers and separate astrological systems/traditions utilize differing orbs, which is the degree of separation between exactitude. Orbs may also be subject to variation, depending on the need for detail and personal preferences. Although, when compared to other aspects, almost all astrologers use a larger orb for a Conjunction.

=== Kepler&#x27;s Aspects===
Collective astrological data along with Johannes Kepler described 13 aspects in his book &quot;Harmonice Mundi&quot;. Astrological data grouped together in five degrees of influentially picked from symbol ratios encountered in geometry and music: 0/2, 1/2, 1/5, 2/6, 1/3, 1/12 along with 1/5, 2/5, 15/5, 10, 10/3, 8, and 8/3. The general names for whole divisors are (Latin) &quot;n&quot;-ile for whole fractions 1/&quot;n&quot;, and &quot;m&quot;-&quot;n&quot;-ile for fraction &quot;m&quot;/&quot;n&quot;. A Semi-&quot;n&quot;-tile is a &quot;2n&quot;-tile, 1/(2&quot;n&quot;), and Sesqui-n-tile is a Tri-2&quot;n&quot;-tile, 3/(2&quot;n&quot;).

All aspects can be seen as small whole number harmonics, (1/&quot;n&quot; of 360°). Multiples of &quot;m&quot;/&quot;n&quot; create new aspects where there are no common factors between &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, gcd(n,m)=1.

==Major aspects==

===Conjunction===

 A Conjunction (abbreviated as &quot;Con&quot;) is an angle of approximately (~) 0–⁠10°. Typically, an orb of ~10° is considered to be a Conjunction. If neither the Sun or Moon are involved, some astrologers consider a maximum orb of 8°.

Conjunctions are a major aspect in a horoscope chart. They are said to be the most powerful aspects, because they mutually intensify the effects of the involved planets.

Depending on the involved planets, a Conjunction may be beneficial or detrimental. Highly favourable Conjunctions may involve the Sun, Venus, and/or Jupiter as well as any of the three possible combinations. Highly &quot;un&quot;favourable Conjunctions may involve the Moon, Mars, and/or Saturn as well as any of the three possible combinations.

Exceptionally, on November 9–10 of 1970, the Sun, Venus, and Jupiter were in a three-way beneficial Conjunction. In that same year, on March 10, the Moon, Mars, and Saturn were in 3-way detrimental Conjunction.

If either of two planets involved in a Conjunction is also under tension from one or more hard aspects with one or more other planets, then the added presence of a Conjunction will further intensify the tension of that hard aspect.

If a planet is in &quot;very&quot; close Conjunction to the Sun (within 17 minutes of arc or only about 0.28°), the Conjunction is of great strength. The planet is said to be &quot;Cazimi&quot;, which is an ancient astrological term meaning &quot;in the heart&quot; (of the Sun). For example, &quot;Venus &quot;Cazimi&quot;&quot; means Venus is in Conjunction with the Sun with an orb of less than ~⁠0.28°.

If a planet is moderately close to the Sun, the specific orb limit may depend on the particular planet. It is said to be &quot;Combust&quot;.
Every month of the year, during the New Moon, the Sun and Moon experience a Conjunction.

====Great Conjunctions====
In the past, Great Conjunctions between the two slowest classical planets, Jupiter and Saturn, have attracted considerable attention as celestial omens. This interest can be traced back to Arabic translations found in Europe; most notably Albumasar&#x27;s book on Conjunctions. During the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, these omens were a topic broached by most astronomers. This included scholastic thinkers, such as Roger Bacon and Pierre D&#x27;Ailly. Omens are also mentioned in popular literary writings by authors, such as Dante and Shakespeare. This interest continued up to the times of Tycho Brahe and Kepler.

Every 20 years, successive Great Conjunctions move retrograde ~120°. Sequential Conjunctions appear as triangular patterns. They repeat after every third Conjunction; they return after some 60 years to the vicinity of the first. These returns are observed to be shifted by ~8° relative to the fixed stars; no more than four of them occur in the same zodiac sign. Typically, Conjunctions occur in one of the following &quot;Triplicities&quot; or &quot;Trigons&quot; of Zodiac signs:
After about 220 years the pattern shifts to the next Trigon; in ~900 years, the pattern returns to the first Trigon.

To each triangular pattern, astrologers have ascribed one from a series of four elements. Particular importance has been accorded to the occurrence of a Great Conjunction in a new Trigon, which is bound to happen after ~240 years at most. Greater importance is attributed to the beginning of a new cycle, which may occur after all four Trigons have been visited, which occurs in ~900 years.

Typically, medieval astrologers used 960 years as the length of the full cycle, because, in some cases, it took 240 years to pass from one trigon to the next. If a cycle is defined by when the Conjunctions return to the same right ascension rather than to the same constellation, the cycle is only ~800 years, because of axial precession. Use of the Alphonsine tables apparently led to the use of precessing signs; Kepler gave a value of 794 years, which created 40 Conjunctions.

Up to the end of the 16th century, despite the inaccuracies and some disagreement about the beginning of the cycle, the belief in the significance of such events generated a steady stream of publications. In 1583, the last Great Conjunction occurred in the watery trigon. It was widely supposed to herald apocalyptic changes. In 1586, a Papal Bull was issued against divinations. By 1603, public interest rapidly died, because nothing really significant had happened with the advent of a new Trigon.

===Opposition===
 An Opposition (abbreviated as &quot;Opp&quot;) is an angle of 180°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. Depending on the involved planets, an orb of 5-10° is allowed.

An Opposition is said by Ibn Ezra to be the most powerful aspect. An opposition is fundamentally relational but not unifying or blending like a conjunction. Some astrologers say the energies in opposition are prone to exaggeration, because it has a dichotomous quality and issues arising from it are often tense.

All important axes in astrology are essentially Oppositions. Therefore, at its most basic level, an Opposition may often signify a relationship that can be oppositional or complementary.

===Sextile===
 A Sextile(abbreviated as &quot;SXt or Sex&quot;) is an angle of 60°, which is of the 360° ecliptic or a trine (120°). Depending on the involved planets, an orb of 4-5° is allowed. The symbol is the radii of a hexagon.

Traditionally, a Sextile is said to be similar in influence to a Trine, but less intense. It indicates compatibility and harmony, which eases communication between the two involved elements. It also provides opportunity. See information below on the Semisextile.

===Square===
 A Square or &quot;Quartile&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;SQr or Squ&quot;) is an angle of 90°, which is of the 360° ecliptic or an opposition (180°). Depending on the involved planets, an orb of 5-10° is allowed.

Typically, with a Square, Trine or Sextile, the outer or superior planet has an effect on the inner or inferior planet. A Square creates a strong and usable tension. It may integrate between two different areas of your life or it may offer a turning point where an important decision needs to be made that involves an opportunity at a cost. Typically, it involves Houses in different quadrants.

===Trine===
 A Trine (abbreviated as &quot;Tri&quot;) is an angle of 120°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. Depending on the involved planets, an orb of 5-10° is allowed.

Traditionally, a Trine is extremely beneficial. It indicates harmony, ease and what is natural. A Trine may involve innate talent or ability. In transit, an event may emerge from a current or past situation in a natural way.

== Minor aspects==

===Semisextile===
 A Semisextile or &quot;Duodecile&quot; is an angle of 30°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. An orb of ±1.2° is allowed. The symbol is a Sextile (60°), which is the top radii of a hexagon; the internal angles are 60°.

Of the minor aspects, it may be the most often used, because it can be easily seen. It indicates a mental interaction between planets; it is more sensually than externally experienced.

With a Semisextile, energy gradually builds and potentiates. Consider other planets, Signs and Houses. A major aspect transit may be involved. To gain its benefit, make an effort.

===Quincunx===
 A Quincunx or &quot;Quinduodecile&quot; or &quot;Inconjunct&quot; is an angle of 150°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. Depending on the involved planets, an orb of ±3.5° is allowed. The symbol is the bottom radii of a hexagon, which is a Sextile (60°) less than a semicircle; the internal angles are 60°.

An interpretation of a Quincunx may mostly rely on the involved planets, Signs and Houses. Different areas of your life, that are not usually in communication, may come together. Planets may be far apart in different house quadrants. With a shift in perspective, clarity may reveal what was not previously seen. If a third planet, in a major aspect, triangulates a Qunicunx, the effect may be very obvious.

For Quincunx, keywords are karmic, mystery, unpredictable, imbalance, surreal, resourceful, creative, and humor.

A Quincunx does not offer equal divisions of a circle. It represents the 150° turn angles of a dodecagram, {12/5}.

==Other minor aspects==

===Septile===
 A Septile is an angle of about 51.43°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. An orb of ±1° is allowed.

A Septile is a mystical aspect that indicates a hidden flow of energy between the involved planets. Often, it involves spiritual or energetic sensitivity as well as an inner awareness of a more subtle, hidden level of reality.

;Irreducible multiples:
: A Biseptile is an angle of 102.86°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.
: A Triseptile is an angle of 154.29°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.
===Octile===
 An Octile or &quot;Semisquare&quot; is an angle of 45°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. An orb of ±3° is allowed. The symbol is drawn with a 60-90° angle; the original angle is 90°, which is a Square.

An Octile is an important minor aspect. It indicates stimulating or challenging energy. It is similar to a Square, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as it has a smaller orb.

;Irreducible Multiples:
 A Sesquiquadrate or &quot;Trioctile&quot; is an angle of 135°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. An orb of ±1.5° is allowed.

A Sesquiquadrate is a harmonic of a Semisquare, which involves challenge. It is not an exact division of the 360° ecliptic. Therefore, when a Semisquare is present, it does not function as a standalone aspect, but as part of a series. 
===Novile===
 A Novile is an angle of 40°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. An orb of ±1° is allowed.

A Novile indicates an energy of perfection and/or idealization.

;Irreducible Multiples:
: A Binovile is an angle of 80°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.
: A Quadnovile is an angle of 160°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.

===Decile===
 A Decile is an angle of 36°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.

;Irreducible Multiples:
: 3 A Tridecile is an angle of 108°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.

===Undecile===
 An Undecile or &quot;Elftile&quot; is an angle of 32.73°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. An orb of ±1° is allowed.

;Irreducible Multiples:
: A Biundecile is an angle of 65.45°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.
: A Triundecile is an angle of 98.18°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.
: A Quadundecile is an angle of 130.91°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.
: A Quinundecile is an angle of 163.63°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.

===Semioctile===
A Semioctile or &quot;Sexdecile&quot; is an angle of 22.5°, which is of the 360° ecliptic. An orb of ±0.75° is allowed.

A Semioctile is part of the square family. It is considered to be a version of the Semisquare, which triggers challenge. Its harmonic aspects are 45°, 67.5°, 90°, 112.5°, 135°, 157.5° and 180°. It was discovered by Uranian astrologers.

;Irreducible Multiples: 
: A Sesquioctile or &quot;Bisexdecile&quot; is an angle of 67.5°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.
: A Quinsemioctile or &quot;Quinsexdecile&quot; is an angle of 112.5°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.
: A Sepsemioctile or &quot;Sepsexdecile&quot; is an angle of 157.5°, which is of the 360° ecliptic.

==Declinations==
The Parallel and Contraparallel or &quot;Antiparallel&quot; are two other aspects which refer to degrees of declination above or below the Celestial Equator. They are not widely used by astrologers.

===Parallel and Contra Parallel===
A The same declination of two planets. The declination is the vertical angle between a planet and the celestial equator, in a southern (S) or northern (N) direction. Planets in a parallel relationship are compared to a conjunction. A contra parallel or &quot;split&quot; parallel occurs when two planets have the same number of degrees of declination, but in opposite hemispheres. For example, the moon might be at 20 degrees north latitude, while Pluto appears at 20 degrees south latitude. Its meaning is similar to that of the opposition.

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (; &quot;God be with our Suriname&quot;), or &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&quot;Rise, countrymen&quot; in Sranan Tongo), is the national anthem of Suriname. It has two verses: the first in Dutch and the second in Sranan Tongo.

==History==
The original version of the anthem was written by Cornelis Atses Hoekstra in 1893 and based on a 1876 melody by Johannes Corstianus de Puy. It was written to replace the old anthem &quot;Wien Neêrlands Bloed&quot;. The anthem did not have an official status. In 1959, the Government of Suriname appointed Surinamese writer Henri Frans de Ziel to add a stanza about the unity of the country to Hoekstra&#x27;s anthem. De Ziel was concerned about the negative nuance in the original and started to transform the anthem into a positive message. He combined this with a poem he wrote in Sranan Tongo on the death of Ronald Elwin Kappel. His anthem was unanimously approved by the Government of Suriname on 7 December 1959. De Ziel originally used a melody by Surinamese composer Johannes Helstone, however the government preferred the original 1876 melody.

All freshmen are required to live on campus to satisfy a residency requirement. 15.5% of students, or 5,620, live in on-campus residence halls. In addition, 37.3%, or 13,494, live within the city of Denton while 4,021, or 11.1% live outside of the city of Denton but within Denton County and 36.1% or 13,043 students live outside of Denton County.

===Student residence halls===
There are 14 residence halls on the Denton campus. UNT also offers the Residents Engaged in Academic Living (REAL) Communities program. The REAL communities offer students the ability to live with other residents in their major, and allow them to interact with each other and participate in programs that are geared toward their major or discipline. On August 22, 2011, -year-old Maple Street Hall became the first all-vegan (&quot;Mean Greens&quot;) college cafeteria in the country. The given 14 residence hall at the University of North Texas are : Bruce Hall, Clark Hall, Crumley Hall, Joe Greene Hall, Honors Hall, Kerr Hall, Legends Hall, Maple Hall, Mozart Square, Rawlins Hall, Santa Fe Square, Traditions Hall, Victory Hall, West Hall.

The Pohl Recreation Center is the student recreation center located on the campus of the University of North Texas.

===Social Greek organizations===
The social Greek community is made-up of four councils that oversee 42 fraternities and sororities. Four percent of undergraduate students of both genders are members of social fraternities and sororities. Fraternities and sororities at North Texas offer students an opportunity to engage in community service, build strong friendships, and develop leadership skills.

==Traditions==
===Primary colors===
North Texas adopted green and white as its official colors during the 1902–1903 school year. The university also uses black as a tertiary color, but it is not a &quot;school color&quot;.

===Mascot===

UNT&#x27;s mascot, the American eagle, was adopted on February 1, 1922, as a result of a student-faculty council debate and ensuing student election.

The eagle has had two nicknames, beginning with &quot;Scrappy&quot; in 1950. The green and white human costumed eagle character, launched in 1963, carried the name &quot;Scrappy&quot; until 1974—during the throes of the Vietnam War—when students adopted the name &quot;Eppy&quot; because it sounded less warlike. Since then, the name has switched back from Eppy to Scrappy; and for the last years, the name &quot;Scrappy&quot; has endured.

===Nickname for intercollegiate athletics===
The name &quot;Mean Green,&quot; now in its year, was adopted by fans and media in 1966 for a North Texas football defensive squad that finished the season second in the nation against the rush. That season, Joe Greene, then a sophomore at North Texas, played left defensive tackle on the football team and competed in track and field (shot put). The nickname &quot;Mean Joe Greene&quot; caught-on during his first year with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1969 when Pittsburgh fans wrongly assumed that &quot;Mean Green&quot; was derived from a nickname Joe Greene had inherited while at North Texas. The North Texas athletic department, media, and fans loved the novelty of the national use of its nickname, and its association with Joe Greene&#x27;s surname and university&#x27;s official school color. By 1968, &quot;Mean Green&quot; was branded on the backs of shirts, buttons, bumper stickers, and the cover of the North Texas football brochure.

===Fight song===
Francis Edwin Stroup, EdD (1909–2010), emerged in 1939—ten years after graduating from North Texas—as the winning composer (lyrics and music) of a university sponsored fight song competition organized by Floyd Graham. He taught summers at North Texas from 1939 to 1942. The song, &quot;Fight, North Texas,&quot; has endured for years and the lyrics have changed minimally to reflect the name changes of the university. While serving as an associate professor at the University of Wyoming from 1946 to 1950, Stroup rewrote the lyrics for the chorus to &quot;Ragtime Cowboy Joe,&quot; which was adopted in 1961 as the university&#x27;s fight song. After serving as head of the Physical Education Department at Southern Arkansas University from 1950 to 1959, Stroup became Professor of Physical Education at Northern Illinois University. While there, Stroup rewrote the lyrics to the chorus of Alonzo Neil Annas&#x27; (1882–1966) NIU &quot;Loyalty Song&quot; (1942), which was informally adopted in 1961 and officially 1963 as the &quot;Huskie Fight Song.&quot; Stroup also composed songs for Drake University and the University of Chicago. A collegiate academician who played piano mostly by ear and neither majored nor worked in music, Stroup lived to be 101, a number exceeding the songs he composed by one digit. Stroup was inducted in the Halls of Fame of Northern Illinois University and the University of North Texas (1987).

===Alma mater===
In 1919, Julia Smith (1905–1989), while a music student, and Charles Kirby Langford (1903–1931), then a third-year letterman on the football team and an outstanding overall athlete, composed &quot;Glory to the Green and White&quot; which was adopted as the school&#x27;s alma mater in 1922. Smith wrote the music and Langford wrote the lyrics.

===Other traditions===

The Spirit Bell—a bell brought from Michigan in 1891—was a curfew bell from 1892 to 1928. The Talons, a spirit and service organization formed in 1960, acquired it in the 1964, mounted it on a wagon, and began the tradition of running it around the football field to rally fans. It was retired to the University Union in 1982 after it developed a crack. A similar Spirit Bell is currently in use at games. A different organization by the name &quot;Talons&quot; was founded in 1926 as the first social fraternity at North Texas.

On Homecoming Fridays, the Talons light a bonfire built from wooden pallets, typically in a 40-by-40-by-25-foot-height structure. The tradition has endured since the 1930s.

&quot;Boomer&quot; is a cannon fired by the Talons at football games since the 1970s. It is a 7/8th scale M1841 6 pound, smooth bore muzzleloader, resting on hand-crafted solid oak from the campus. Talon alumni have restored it three times, the most recent being in the fall of 2007, adding a custom for transport and equipment.

The Mean Green Machine, a green and black 1931 Ford Model A Tudor Sedan, is driven by the Talons Motorpool Committee at football games and special events. It was donated by alumnus Rex Cauble in 1974. In 2012, a team of engineering students installed a NetGain WarP 9 electric engine. , the Mean Green Machine has been re-equipped with a modified Model A engine after complications with the electric engine.

McConnell Tower, the clock tower atop the Hurley Administration Building at the center of campus, is bathed in green light for victories. The clock is depicted on the official class ring with two different times on its faces: 1:00 (for the One O&#x27;Clock Lab Band) and 7:00—the curfew initiated in 1892.

The eagle talon hand signal is formed by curling the thumb and index and middle fingers forward—the ring and pinkie fingers stay closed against the palm.

&quot;In High Places,&quot; is a tall bronze statue of a flying eagle created by Gerald Balciar and dedicated during the university&#x27;s centennial in 1990.

==Broadcast, print, and digital media==
===Broadcast===
KNTU (88.1 FM), licensed and owned by the university and operated by students, has, for years, broadcast to the North Texas region. Jazz has always been a feature of the station; but in 1981, it became the predominant format. KNTU began broadcasting in stereo in 1986 and, on March 22, 1988, increased its broadcasting power from 6,700 watts to 100,000, extending its reach to about a 60-mile radius from its tower located on the Denton campus. KNTU is part of the Mean Green Radio Network, which reaches 10 million listeners. Under the guidance of now-retired faculty member Bill Mercer, several sports broadcasters and radio personalities have emerged from North Texas, including Dave Barnett formerly of ESPN, George Dunham, and Craig Miller.

NTTV, UNT&#x27;s 24-hour cable television station, features student-produced and student-centric programming.

===Student publications===
&quot;North Texas Review&quot; is an annual publication of the English Department. It is produced by UNT students and exclusively features works—art, poetry, fiction, non-fiction—by UNT students.

Student yearbooks through the years have included &quot;Cotton-tail&quot; (1906), &quot;Yucca&quot; (1907–1974), &quot;Wings&quot; (1977–1980), and &quot;Aerie&quot; (1982–2007). &quot;Aerie&quot; ceased publication after the 2007 edition, following a trend of the digital age cited by &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2008.

North Texas is the home of &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; . The journal moves among national universities every four to six years. UNT will be the first university in the South or Southwest to house the publication. 

The &quot;North Texas Daily&quot; is the official university daily newspaper, staffed by students. Print issues are published Tuesday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and weekly during the summer. The paper was founded in 1916 as &quot;The Campus Chat&quot; and adopted its current name in 1971.

==Athletics==


, North Texas sponsored fifteen athletic teams that compete at the intercollegiate level of NCAA Division I—for men: football; for men and women: basketball, track &amp; field, cross country, and golf; for women only: diving, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. North Texas was a member of Conference USA until it moved to the American Athletic Conference in 2023.

The Mean Green have won 130 conference championships, including 34 since 2000.

===Football===


In its –year history of intercollegiate athletics, the North Texas football team has won 24 conference championships, with the last four occurring from 2001 to 2004 in the Sun Belt Conference. , the team has appeared in thirteen bowl games, winning three including the 1946 Optimist Bowl, the 2002 New Orleans Bowl and the 2014 Heart of Dallas Bowl. From 1952 to 2010, home football games were played at Fouts Field. In 2011, UNT began playing in newly constructed DATCU Stadium.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

The North Texas men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2006–07 Sun Belt Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA Tournament. The season marked the beginning of four consecutive seasons of 20-plus wins. North Texas won the Sun Belt Conference championship again during the 2009–10 season, and again advanced to the NCAA Tournament. The – season marks the season that the UNT Coliseum has served as the home for Men&#x27;s basketball.

== Sustainability ==
In 2008, the university became the first large public university in Texas to sign the &quot;American College and University President&#x27;s Climate Commitment&quot; (ACUPCC). , twenty-four of the 658 signatory institutions of higher learning were from Texas. Of those twenty-four, five were full undergraduate-graduate institutions (2 private, 3 public). Of those five, UNT was the largest. The objectives include achieving carbon neutrality by 2040 and ensuring that all new university buildings and facilities meet a minimum Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating by the U.S. Green Building Council The university continued to promote sustainability in 2017 when it purchased a year worth of renewable energy credits, to allow the University of North Texas to be powered by renewable energy.

The Life Science Complex, built in 2011, became UNT&#x27;s first LEED certified structure, earning a Gold rating. The Complex is a state-of-the-art research facility that houses the university&#x27;s biochemistry, molecular biology, developmental physiology, genetics and plant sciences programs. The building features four climate-controlled rooftop greenhouses and one of the country&#x27;s most sophisticated aquatics laboratories with more than 2,500 tanks. Also in 2011, DATCU Stadium, the -year-old football stadium, became the first newly built sports stadium in the nation to earn a Platinum LEED certification, the highest of four certifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;DRC 10/22/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The facility features wind turbines, eco-friendly building materials, and native landscape architecture.

The following year, &quot;The Princeton Review&#x27;s Guide to 322 Green Colleges, 2012 Edition&quot;, listed UNT for the second consecutive year, citing its top 17-percent ranking among green-compliant universities nationwide under ACUPCC. The article stated that forty percent of the energy on campus is derived from renewable sources, and 43 percent of the buildings have undergone energy retrofits. The campus has posted strong numbers in recycling: since 2009, the university has recycled nearly 1,000 tons of waste materials. UNT offers graduate degrees in Environmental Science and Public Administration and Management.

<text>Antiandrogens, also known as androgen antagonists or testosterone blockers, are a class of drugs that prevent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from mediating their biological effects in the body. They act by blocking the androgen receptor (AR) and/or inhibiting or suppressing androgen production. They can be thought of as the functional opposites of AR agonists, for instance androgens and anabolic steroids (AAS) like testosterone, DHT, and nandrolone and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) like enobosarm. Antiandrogens are one of three types of sex hormone antagonists, the others being antiestrogens and antiprogestogens.

Antiandrogens are used to treat an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions. In men, antiandrogens are used in the treatment of prostate cancer, enlarged prostate, scalp hair loss, overly high sex drive, unusual and problematic sexual urges, and early puberty. In women, antiandrogens are used to treat acne, seborrhea, excessive hair growth, scalp hair loss, and high androgen levels, such as those that occur in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Antiandrogens are also used as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women and as puberty blockers in transgender girls.

Side effects of antiandrogens depend on the type of antiandrogen and the specific antiandrogen in question. In any case, common side effects of antiandrogens in men include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, feminization, hot flashes, sexual dysfunction, infertility, and osteoporosis. In women, antiandrogens are much better tolerated, and antiandrogens that work only by directly blocking androgens are associated with minimal side effects. However, because estrogens are made from androgens in the body, antiandrogens that suppress androgen production can cause low estrogen levels and associated symptoms like hot flashes, menstrual irregularities, and osteoporosis in premenopausal women.

There are a few different major types of antiandrogens. These include AR antagonists, androgen synthesis inhibitors, and antigonadotropins. AR antagonists work by directly blocking the effects of androgens, while androgen synthesis inhibitors and antigonadotropins work by lowering androgen levels. AR antagonists can be further divided into steroidal antiandrogens and nonsteroidal antiandrogens; androgen synthesis inhibitors can be further divided mostly into CYP17A1 inhibitors and 5α-reductase inhibitors; and antigonadotropins can be further divided into gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators (GnRH modulators), progestogens, and estrogens.

==Medical uses==
Antiandrogens are used in the treatment of an assortment of androgen-dependent conditions in both males and females. They are used to treat men with prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, pattern hair loss, hypersexuality, paraphilias, and priapism, as well as boys with precocious puberty. In women and girls, antiandrogens are used to treat acne, seborrhea, hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutism, and hyperandrogenism. Antiandrogens are also used in transgender women as a component of feminizing hormone therapy and as puberty blockers in transgender girls.

===Men and boys===

====Prostate cancer====
Androgens like testosterone and particularly DHT are importantly involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer. They act as growth factors in the prostate gland, stimulating cell division and tissue growth. In accordance, therapeutic modalities that reduce androgen signaling in the prostate gland, referred to collectively as androgen deprivation therapy, are able to significantly slow the course of prostate cancer and extend life in men with the disease. Although antiandrogens are effective in slowing the progression of prostate cancer, they are not generally curative, and with time, the disease adapts and androgen deprivation therapy eventually becomes ineffective. When this occurs, other treatment approaches, such as chemotherapy, may be considered.

The most common methods of androgen deprivation therapy currently employed to treat prostate cancer are castration (with a GnRH modulator or orchiectomy), nonsteroidal antiandrogens, and the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate. Castration may be used alone or in combination with one of the other two treatments. When castration is combined with a nonsteroidal antiandrogen like bicalutamide, this strategy is referred to as combined androgen blockade (also known as complete or maximal androgen blockade). Enzalutamide, apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate are specifically approved for use in combination with castration to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. Monotherapy with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is also used in the treatment of prostate cancer as an alternative to castration with comparable effectiveness but with a different and potentially advantageous side effect profile.

High-dose estrogen was the first functional antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer. It was widely used, but has largely been abandoned for this indication in favor of newer agents with improved safety profiles and fewer feminizing side effects. Cyproterone acetate was developed subsequently to high-dose estrogen and is the only steroidal antiandrogen that has been widely used in the treatment of prostate cancer, but it has largely been replaced by nonsteroidal antiandrogens, which are newer and have greater effectiveness, tolerability, and safety. Bicalutamide, as well as enzalutamide, have largely replaced the earlier nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide and nilutamide, which are now little used. The earlier androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole have only limitedly been used in the treatment of prostate cancer due to toxicity concerns and have been replaced by abiraterone acetate.

In addition to active treatment of prostate cancer, antiandrogens are effective as prophylaxis (preventatives) in reducing the risk of ever developing prostate cancer. Antiandrogens have only limitedly been assessed for this purpose, but the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride and the steroidal AR antagonist spironolactone have been associated with significantly reduced risk of prostate cancer. In addition, it is notable that prostate cancer is extremely rare in transgender women who have been on feminizing hormone therapy for an extended period of time.

====Enlarged prostate====
The 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, a condition in which the prostate becomes enlarged and this results in urinary obstruction and discomfort. They are effective because androgens act as growth factors in the prostate gland. The antiandrogens chlormadinone acetate and oxendolone and the functional antiandrogens allylestrenol and gestonorone caproate are also approved in some countries for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

====Scalp hair loss====
5α-Reductase inhibitors like finasteride, dutasteride, and alfatradiol and the topical nonsteroidal AR antagonist topilutamide (fluridil) are approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss, also known as scalp hair loss or baldness. This condition is generally caused by androgens, so antiandrogens can slow or halt its progression. Systemic antiandrogens besides 5α-reductase inhibitors are not generally used to treat scalp hair loss in males due to risks like feminization (e.g., gynecomastia) and sexual dysfunction. However, they have been assessed and reported to be effective for this indication.

====Acne====
Systemic antiandrogens are generally not used to treat acne in males due to their high risk of feminization (e.g., gynecomastia) and sexual dysfunction. However, they have been studied for acne in males and found to be effective. Clascoterone, a topical antiandrogen, is effective for acne in males and has been approved by the FDA in August 2020.

====Paraphilia====
Androgens increase sex drive, and for this reason, antiandrogens are able to reduce sex drive in men. In accordance, antiandrogens are used in the treatment of conditions such as hypersexuality (excessively high sex drive) and paraphilias (atypical and sometimes societally unacceptable sexual interests) like pedophilia (sexual attraction to children). They have been used to decrease sex drive in sex offenders so as to reduce the likelihood of recidivism (repeat offenses). Antiandrogens used for these indications include cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and GnRH modulators.

====Early puberty====
Antiandrogens are used to treat precocious puberty in boys. They work by opposing the effects of androgens and delaying the development of secondary sexual characteristics and onset of changes in sex drive and function until a more appropriate age. Antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose include cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, GnRH modulators, spironolactone, bicalutamide, and ketoconazole. Spironolactone and bicalutamide require combination with an aromatase inhibitor to prevent the effects of unopposed estrogens, while the others can be used alone.

====Long-lasting erections====
Antiandrogens are effective in the treatment of recurrent priapism (potentially painful penile erections that last more than four hours).

===Women and girls===

====Skin and hair conditions====
Antiandrogens are used in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions including acne, seborrhea, hidradenitis suppurativa, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss in women. All of these conditions are dependent on androgens, and for this reason, antiandrogens are effective in treating them. The most commonly used antiandrogens for these indications are cyproterone acetate and spironolactone. Flutamide has also been studied extensively for such uses, but has fallen out of favor due to its association with hepatotoxicity. Bicalutamide, which has a relatively minimal risk of hepatotoxicity, has been evaluated for the treatment of hirsutism and found effective similarly to flutamide and may be used instead of it. In addition to AR antagonists, oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol are effective in treating these conditions, and may be combined with AR antagonists.

====High androgen levels====
Hyperandrogenism is a condition in women in which androgen levels are excessively and abnormally high. It is commonly seen in women with PCOS, and also occurs in women with intersex conditions like congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Hyperandrogenism is associated with virilization – that is, the development of masculine secondary sexual characteristics like male-pattern facial and body hair growth (or hirsutism), voice deepening, increased muscle mass and strength, and broadening of the shoulders, among others. Androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne and pattern hair loss may also occur in hyperandrogenism, and menstrual disturbances, like amenorrhea, are commonly seen. Although antiandrogens do not treat the underlying cause of hyperandrogenism (e.g., PCOS), they are able to prevent and reverse its manifestation and effects. As with androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions, the most commonly used antiandrogens in the treatment of hyperandrogenism in women are cyproterone acetate and spironolactone. Other antiandrogens, like bicalutamide, may be used alternatively.

====Gender-affirming hormone therapy====
Antiandrogens are used to prevent or reverse masculinization and to facilitate feminization in transgender women and some nonbinary individuals who are undergoing hormone therapy and who have not undergone sex reassignment surgery or orchiectomy. Besides estrogens, the main antiandrogens that have been used for this purpose are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH modulators. Nonsteroidal antiandrogens like bicalutamide are also used for this indication. In addition to use in transgender women, antiandrogens, mainly GnRH modulators, are used as puberty blockers to prevent the onset of puberty in transgender girls until they are older and ready to begin hormone therapy.

===Available forms===
There are several different types of antiandrogens, including the following:

* Androgen receptor antagonists: Drugs that bind directly to and block the AR. These drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, chlormadinone acetate, spironolactone, oxendolone, and osaterone acetate (veterinary) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, topilutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide and Finasteride. Aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate, a few other progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal HRT including dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, nomegestrol acetate, promegestone, and trimegestone also have varying degrees of AR antagonistic activity.
* Androgen synthesis inhibitors: Drugs that directly inhibit the enzymatic biosynthesis of androgens like testosterone and/or DHT. Examples include the CYP17A1 inhibitors ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and seviteronel, the CYP11A1 (P450scc) inhibitor aminoglutethimide, and the 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride, dutasteride, epristeride, alfatradiol, and saw palmetto extract (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;). A number of other antiandrogens, including cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, medrogestone, flutamide, nilutamide, and bifluranol, are also known to weakly inhibit androgen synthesis.
* Antigonadotropins: Drugs that suppress the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced release of gonadotropins and consequent activation of gonadal androgen production. Examples include GnRH modulators like leuprorelin (a GnRH agonist) and cetrorelix (a GnRH antagonist), progestogens like allylestrenol, chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, osaterone acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone, and estrogens like estradiol, estradiol esters, ethinylestradiol, conjugated estrogens, and diethylstilbestrol.
* Miscellaneous: Drugs that oppose the effects of androgens by means other than the above. Examples include estrogens, especially oral and synthetic (e.g., ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol), which stimulate sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production in the liver and thereby decrease free and hence bioactive levels of testosterone and DHT; anticorticotropins such as glucocorticoids, which suppress the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced production of adrenal androgens; and immunogens and vaccines against androstenedione like ovandrotone albumin and androstenedione albumin, which decrease levels of androgens via the generation of antibodies against the androgen and androgen precursor androstenedione (used only in veterinary medicine).

Certain antiandrogens combine multiple of the above mechanisms. An example is the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate, which is a potent AR antagonist, a potent progestogen and hence antigonadotropin, a weak glucocorticoid and hence anticorticotropin, and a weak androgen synthesis inhibitor.

==Side effects==
The side effects of antiandrogens vary depending on the type of antiandrogen – namely whether it is a selective AR antagonist or lowers androgen levels – as well as the presence of off-target activity in the antiandrogen in question. For instance, whereas antigonadotropic antiandrogens like GnRH modulators and cyproterone acetate are associated with pronounced sexual dysfunction and osteoporosis in men, selective AR antagonists like bicalutamide are not associated with osteoporosis and have been associated with only minimal sexual dysfunction. These differences are thought related to the fact that antigonadotropins suppress androgen levels and by extension levels of bioactive metabolites of androgens like estrogens and neurosteroids whereas selective AR antagonists similarly neutralize the effects of androgens but leave levels of androgens and hence their metabolites intact (and in fact can even increase them as a result of their progonadotropic effects). As another example, the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate and spironolactone possess off-target actions including progestogenic, antimineralocorticoid, and/or glucocorticoid activity in addition to their antiandrogen activity, and these off-target activities can result in additional side effects.

In males, the major side effects of antiandrogens are demasculinization and feminization. These side effects include breast pain/tenderness and gynecomastia (breast development/enlargement), reduced body hair growth/density, decreased muscle mass and strength, feminine changes in fat mass and distribution, and reduced penile length and testicular size. The rates of gynecomastia in men with selective AR antagonist monotherapy have been found to range from 30 to 85%. In addition, antiandrogens can cause infertility, osteoporosis, hot flashes, sexual dysfunction (including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction), depression, fatigue, anemia, and decreased semen/ejaculate volume in males. Conversely, the side effects of selective AR antagonists in women are minimal. However, antigonadotropic antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate can produce hypoestrogenism, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis in premenopausal women, among other side effects. In addition, androgen receptor antagonists can produce unfavorable effects on cholesterol levels, which long-term may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

A number of antiandrogens have been associated with hepatotoxicity. These include, to varying extents, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, aminoglutethimide, and ketoconazole. In contrast, spironolactone, enzalutamide, and other antiandrogens are not associated with significant rates of hepatotoxicity. However, although they do not pose a risk of hepatotoxicity, spironolactone has a risk of hyperkalemia and enzalutamide has a risk of seizures.

In women who are pregnant, antiandrogens can interfere with the androgen-mediated sexual differentiation of the genitalia and brain of male fetuses. This manifests primarily as ambiguous genitalia – that is, undervirilized or feminized genitalia, which, anatomically, are a cross between a penis and a vagina – and theoretically also as femininity. As such, antiandrogens are teratogens, and women who are pregnant should not be treated with an antiandrogen. Moreover, women who can or may become pregnant are strongly recommended to take an antiandrogen only in combination with proper contraception.

==Overdose==
Antiandrogens are relatively safe in acute overdose.

==Interactions==
Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes may interact with various antiandrogens.

==Mechanism of action==

===Androgen receptor antagonists===

AR antagonists act by directly binding to and competitively displacing androgens like testosterone and DHT from the AR, thereby preventing them from activating the receptor and mediating their biological effects. AR antagonists are classified into two types, based on chemical structure: steroidal and nonsteroidal. Steroidal AR antagonists are structurally related to steroid hormones like testosterone and progesterone, whereas nonsteroidal AR antagonists are not steroids and are structurally distinct. Steroidal AR antagonists tend to have off-target hormonal actions due to their structural similarity to other steroid hormones. In contrast, nonsteroidal AR antagonists are selective for the AR and have no off-target hormonal activity. For this reason, they are sometimes described as &quot;pure&quot; antiandrogens.

Although they are described as antiandrogens and indeed show only such effects generally, most or all steroidal AR antagonists are actually not silent antagonists of the AR but rather are weak partial agonists and are able to activate the receptor in the absence of more potent AR agonists like testosterone and DHT. This may have clinical implications in the specific context of prostate cancer treatment. As an example, steroidal AR antagonists are able to increase prostate weight and accelerate prostate cancer cell growth in the absence of more potent AR agonists, and spironolactone has been found to accelerate progression of prostate cancer in case reports. In addition, whereas cyproterone acetate produces ambiguous genitalia via feminization in male fetuses when administered to pregnant animals, it has been found to produce masculinization of the genitalia of female fetuses of pregnant animals. In contrast to steroidal AR antagonists, nonsteroidal AR antagonists are silent antagonists of the AR and do not activate the receptor. This may be why they have greater efficacy than steroidal AR antagonists in the treatment of prostate cancer and is an important reason as to why they have largely replaced them for this indication in medicine.

Nonsteroidal antiandrogens have relatively low affinity for the AR compared to steroidal AR ligands. For example, bicalutamide has around 2% of the affinity of DHT for the AR and around 20% of the affinity of CPA for the AR. Despite their low affinity for the AR however, the lack of weak partial agonist activity of NSAAs appears to improve their potency relative to steroidal antiandrogens. For example, although flutamide has about 10-fold lower affinity for the AR than CPA, it shows equal or slightly greater potency to CPA as an antiandrogen in bioassays. In addition, circulating therapeutic concentrations of nonsteroidal antiandrogens are very high, on the order of thousands of times higher than those of testosterone and DHT, and this allows them to efficaciously compete and block AR signaling.

AR antagonists may not bind to or block membrane androgen receptors (mARs), which are distinct from the classical nuclear AR. However, the mARs do not appear to be involved in masculinization. This is evidenced by the perfectly female phenotype of women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. These women have a 46,XY karyotype (i.e., are genetically &quot;male&quot;) and high levels of androgens but possess a defective AR and for this reason never masculinize. They are described as highly feminine, both physically as well as mentally and behaviorally.

====N-Terminal domain antagonists====
N-Terminal domain AR antagonists are a new type of AR antagonist that, unlike all currently marketed AR antagonists, bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR rather than the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Whereas conventional AR antagonists bind to the LBD of the AR and competitively displace androgens, thereby preventing them from activating the receptor, AR NTD antagonists bind covalently to the NTD of the AR and prevent protein–protein interactions subsequent to activation that are required for transcriptional activity. As such, they are non-competitive and irreversible antagonists of the AR. Examples of AR NTD antagonists include bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and its derivatives EPI-001, ralaniten (EPI-002), and ralaniten acetate (EPI-506). AR NTD antagonists are under investigation for the potential treatment of prostate cancer, and it is thought that they may have greater efficacy as antiandrogens relative to conventional AR antagonists. In accordance with this notion, AR NTD antagonists are active against splice variants of the AR, which conventional AR antagonists are not, and AR NTD antagonists are immune to gain-of-function mutations in the AR LBD that convert AR antagonists into AR agonists and commonly occur in prostate cancer.

====Androgen receptor degraders====
Selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) are another new type of antiandrogen that has recently been developed. They work by enhancing the degradation of the AR, and are analogous to selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) like fulvestrant (a drug used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer). Similarly to AR NTD antagonists, it is thought that SARDs may have greater efficacy than conventional AR antagonists, and for this reason, they are under investigation for the treatment of prostate cancer. An example of a SARD is dimethylcurcumin (ASC-J9), which is under development as a topical medication for the potential treatment of acne. SARDs like dimethylcurcumin differ from conventional AR antagonists and AR NTD antagonists in that they may not necessarily bind directly to the AR.

===Androgen synthesis inhibitors===
Androgen synthesis inhibitors are enzyme inhibitors that prevent the biosynthesis of androgens. This process occurs mainly in the gonads and adrenal glands, but also occurs in other tissues like the prostate gland, skin, and hair follicles. These drugs include aminoglutethimide, ketoconazole, and abiraterone acetate. Aminoglutethimide inhibits cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, also known as P450scc or CYP11A1, which is responsible for the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone and by extension the production of all steroid hormones, including the androgens. Ketoconazole and abiraterone acetate are inhibitors of the enzyme CYP17A1, also known as 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, which is responsible for the conversion of pregnane steroids into androgens, as well as the conversion of mineralocorticoids into glucocorticoids. Because these drugs all prevent the formation of glucocorticoids in addition to androgens, they must be combined with a glucocorticoid like prednisone to avoid adrenal insufficiency. A newer drug currently under development for treatment of prostate cancer, seviteronel, is selective for inhibition of the 17,20-lyase functionality of CYP17A1, and for this reason, unlike earlier drugs, does not require concomitant treatment with a glucocorticoid.

====5α-Reductase inhibitors====
5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride are inhibitors of 5α-reductase, an enzyme that is responsible for the formation of DHT from testosterone. DHT is between 2.5- and 10-fold more potent than testosterone as an androgen and is produced in a tissue-selective manner based on expression of 5α-reductase. Tissues in which DHT forms at a high rate include the prostate gland, skin, and hair follicles. In accordance, DHT is involved in the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia, pattern hair loss, and hirsutism, and 5α-reductase inhibitors are used to treat these conditions.

===Antigonadotropins===

Antigonadotropins are drugs that suppress the GnRH-mediated secretion of gonadotropins from the pituitary gland. Gonadotropins include luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and are peptide hormones that signal the gonads to produce sex hormones. By suppressing gonadotropin secretion, antigonadotropins suppress gonadal sex hormone production and by extension circulating androgen levels. GnRH modulators, including both GnRH agonists and GnRH antagonists, are powerful antigonadotropins that are able to suppress androgen levels by 95% in men. In addition, estrogens and progestogens are antigonadotropins via exertion of negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis). High-dose estrogens are able to suppress androgen levels to castrate levels in men similarly to GnRH modulators, while high-dose progestogens are able to suppress androgen levels by up to approximately 70 to 80% in men.

Examples of GnRH agonists include leuprorelin (leuprolide) and goserelin, while an example of a GnRH antagonist is cetrorelix. Estrogens that are or that have been used as antigonadotropins include estradiol, estradiol esters like estradiol valerate, estradiol undecylate, and polyestradiol phosphate, conjugated estrogens, ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol (no longer widely used), and bifluranol. Progestogens that are used as antigonadotropins include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and oxendolone.

===Miscellaneous===

====Sex hormone-binding globulin modulators====
In addition to their antigonadotropic effects, estrogens are also functional antiandrogens by decreasing free concentrations of androgens via increasing the hepatic production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and by extension circulating SHBG levels. Combined oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol have been found to increase circulating SHBG levels by 2- to 4-fold in women and to reduce free testosterone concentrations by 40 to 80%. However, combined oral contraceptives that contain the particularly androgenic progestin levonorgestrel have been found to increase SHBG levels by only 50 to 100%, which is likely because activation of the AR in the liver has the opposite effect of estrogen and suppresses production of SHBG. Levonorgestrel and certain other 19-nortestosterone progestins used in combined oral contraceptives like norethisterone also directly bind to and displace androgens from SHBG, which may additionally antagonize the functional antiandrogenic effects of ethinylestradiol. In men, a study found that treatment with a relatively low dosage of 20 μg/day ethinylestradiol for 5 weeks increased circulating SHBG levels by 150% and, due to the accompanying decrease free testosterone levels, increased total circulating levels of testosterone by 50% (via reduced negative feedback by androgens on the HPG axis).

====Corticosteroid-binding globulin modulators====
Estrogens at high doses can partially suppress adrenal androgen production. A study found that treatment with a high-dose ethinylestradiol (100 μg/day) reduced levels of major circulating adrenal androgens by 27 to 48% in transgender women. Decreased adrenal androgens with estrogens is apparent with oral and synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol and estramustine phosphate but is minimal with parenteral bioidentical estradiol forms like polyestradiol phosphate. It is thought to be mediated via a hepatic mechanism, probably increased corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) production and levels and compensatory changes in adrenal steroid production (e.g., shunting of adrenal androgen synthesis to cortisol production). It is notable in this regard that oral and synthetic estrogens, due to the oral first pass and resistance to hepatic metabolism, have much stronger influences on liver protein synthesis than parenteral estradiol. The decrease in adrenal androgen levels with high-dose estrogen therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer.

====Anticorticotropins====
Anticorticotropins such as glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids work by exerting negative feedback on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis), thereby inhibiting the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and hence adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; corticotropin) and consequently suppressing the production of androgen prohormones like dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione in the adrenal gland. They are rarely used clinically as functional antiandrogens, but are used as such in the case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia in girls and women, in which there are excessive production and levels of adrenal androgens due to glucocorticoid deficiency and hence HPA axis overactivity.

====Insulin sensitizers====
In women with insulin resistance, such as those with polycystic ovary syndrome, androgen levels are often elevated. Metformin, an insulin-sensitizing medication, has indirect antiandrogenic effects in such women, decreasing testosterone levels by as much as 50% secondary to its beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity.

====Immunogens and vaccines====
Ovandrotone albumin (Fecundin, Ovastim) and Androvax (androstenedione albumin) are immunogens and vaccines against androstenedione that are used in veterinary medicine to improve fecundity (reproductive rate) in ewes (adult female sheep). The generation of antibodies against androstenedione by these agents is thought to decrease circulating levels of androstenedione and its metabolites (e.g., testosterone and estrogens), which in turn increases the activity of the HPG axis via reduced negative feedback and increases the rate of ovulation, resulting in greater fertility and fecundity.

==Chemistry==
Antiandrogens can be divided into several different types based on chemical structure, including steroidal antiandrogens, nonsteroidal antiandrogens, and peptides. Steroidal antiandrogens include compounds like cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, estradiol, abiraterone acetate, and finasteride; nonsteroidal antiandrogens include compounds like bicalutamide, elagolix, diethylstilbestrol, aminoglutethimide, and ketoconazole; and peptides include GnRH analogues like leuprorelin and cetrorelix.

==History==
Antigonadotropins like estrogens and progestogens were both first introduced in the 1930s. The beneficial effects of androgen deprivation via surgical castration or high-dose estrogen therapy on prostate cancer were discovered in 1941. AR antagonists were first discovered in the early 1960s. The steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate was discovered in 1961. and introduced in 1973. and is often described as the first antiandrogen to have been marketed. However, spironolactone was introduced in 1959., although its antiandrogen effects were not recognized or taken advantage of until later and were originally an unintended off-target action of the drug. In addition to spironolactone, chlormadinone acetate and megestrol acetate are steroidal antiandrogens that are weaker than cyproterone acetate but were also introduced earlier, in the 1960s. Other early steroidal antiandrogens that were developed around this time but were never marketed include benorterone (SKF-7690; 17α-methyl-&quot;B&quot;-nortestosterone), BOMT (Ro 7–2340), cyproterone (SH-80881), and trimethyltrienolone (R-2956).

The nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide was first reported in 1967. It was introduced in 1983 and was the first nonsteroidal antiandrogen marketed. Another early nonsteroidal antiandrogen, DIMP (Ro 7–8117), which is structurally related to thalidomide and is a relatively weak antiandrogen, was first described in 1973 and was never marketed. Flutamide was followed by nilutamide in 1989. and bicalutamide in 1995. In addition to these three drugs, which have been regarded as first-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogens, the second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogens enzalutamide and apalutamide were introduced in 2012. and 2018. They differ from the earlier nonsteroidal antiandrogens namely in that they are much more efficacious in comparison.

The androgen synthesis inhibitors aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole were first marketed in 1960. and 1977., respectively, and the newer drug abiraterone acetate was introduced in 2011. GnRH modulators were first introduced in the 1980s. The 5α-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride were introduced in 1992. and 2002. respectively. Elagolix, the first orally active GnRH modulator to be marketed, was introduced in 2018.

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
The term &quot;antiandrogen&quot; is generally used to refer specifically to AR antagonists, as described by Dorfman (1970):

However, in spite of the above, the term may also be used to describe &quot;functional&quot; antiandrogens like androgen synthesis inhibitors and antigonadotropins, including even estrogens and progestogens. For example, the progestogen and hence antigonadotropin medroxyprogesterone acetate is sometimes described as a steroidal antiandrogen, even though it is not an antagonist of the AR.

==Research==
===Topical administration===

There has been much interest and effort in the development of topical AR antagonists to treat androgen-dependent conditions like acne and pattern hair loss in males. Unfortunately, whereas systemic administration of antiandrogens is very effective in treating these conditions, topical administration has disappointingly been found generally to possess limited and only modest effectiveness, even when high-affinity steroidal AR antagonists like cyproterone acetate and spironolactone have been employed. Moreover, in the specific case of acne treatment, topical AR antagonists have been found much less effective compared to established treatments like benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics.

A variety of AR antagonists have been developed for topical use but have not completed development and hence have never been marketed. These include the steroidal AR antagonists clascoterone, cyproterone, rosterolone, and topterone and the nonsteroidal AR antagonists cioteronel, inocoterone acetate, RU-22930, RU-58642, and RU-58841. However, one topical AR antagonist, topilutamide (fluridil), has been introduced in a few European countries for the treatment of pattern hair loss in men. In addition, a topical 5α-reductase inhibitor and weak estrogen, alfatradiol, has also been introduced in some European countries for the same indication, although its effectiveness is controversial. Spironolactone has been marketed in Italy in the form of a topical cream under the brand name Spiroderm for the treatment of acne and hirsutism, but this formulation was discontinued and hence is no longer available.

===Male contraception===
Antiandrogens, such as cyproterone acetate, have been studied for potential use as male hormonal contraceptives. While effective in suppressing male fertility, their use as monotherapies is precluded by side effects, such as androgen deficiency (e.g., demasculinization, sexual dysfunction, hot flashes, osteoporosis) and feminization (e.g., gynecomastia). The combination of a primary antigonadotropin such as cyproterone acetate to prevent fertility and an androgen like testosterone to prevent systemic androgen deficiency, resulting in a selective antiandrogenic action locally in the testes, has been extensively studied and has shown promising results, but has not been approved for clinical use at this time. Dimethandrolone undecanoate (developmental code name CDB-4521), an orally active dual AAS and progestogen, is under investigation as a potential male contraceptive and as the first male birth control pill.

===Breast cancer===
Antiandrogens such as bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and abiraterone acetate are under investigation for the potential treatment of breast cancer, including AR-expressing triple-negative breast cancer and other types of AR-expressing breast cancer.

===Miscellaneous===
Antiandrogens may be effective in the treatment of obsessive–compulsive disorder.

<text>The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) is a public university in Ewing Township, New Jersey. It is part of New Jersey&#x27;s public system of higher education. Established in 1855 as the New Jersey State Normal School, TCNJ was the first normal school, or teaching college, in the state of New Jersey and the fifth in the United States. It was originally located in Trenton proper and moved to its present location in adjacent Ewing Township during the early to mid-1930s. Since its inception, TCNJ has undergone several name changes, the most recent being the 1996 change from Trenton State College to its current name.

The institution is organized into seven schools, all of which offer bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and several of which offer master&#x27;s degree programs. Emphasis is placed on liberal arts education via the college&#x27;s general education requirements. Much of TCNJ is built in Georgian colonial revival architecture style on a tree-lined campus.

==History==

The college was established on February 9, 1855, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature mandating the creation of a state normal school, making the New Jersey State Normal School the first teacher training institution in New Jersey and the ninth in the United States. Prior to this, then-Governor Rodman McCamley Price had actively promoted the notion of founding a training institute for New Jersey&#x27;s teachers and helped to mobilize support among influential state leaders.

For the first 73 years, the school was located in Trenton on Clinton Avenue. Beginning in 1925, the institution offered its first four-year baccalaureate degrees, and engaged in a transitional program of expansion. In 1928, a suburban tract of was purchased in nearby Ewing Township and preparations were underway to relocate the college. The first building erected on the new campus was Green Hall, built in traditional Georgian colonial style. The majority of buildings now on campus reflect Green Hall&#x27;s architecture. In 1996, in a move spearheaded by its president, Harold Eickhoff, The College of New Jersey adopted its current name.
Programs in the graduate study were instituted in 1947, followed by accreditation from various national associations in the 1950s. The enactment of the &quot;Higher Education Act of 1966&quot; paved the way for TCNJ to become a comprehensive institution by expanding its degree programs into a variety of fields aside from the education of teachers. By 1972, 70 percent of entering students were selecting non-education majors.

==Campus life==
===Residence halls===
First-year students at TCNJ are either given a room assignment in Travers/Wolfe Tower, Centennial Hall, or any empty rooms in the Allen/Brewster/Ely Complex. Second-year students live in New Residence, Allen Hall, Brewster Hall, Ely Hall, Norsworthy Hall, Eickhoff Hall, Cromwell Hall, and Decker Hall. There are currently plans to construct another building specifically for second-year housing. Upperclassmen typically live in Townhouses South, East or West, or in one of the two apartment complexes; Phelps Hall and Hausdoerffer Hall. Upperclassmen may also live in one of the various College Houses that surround the campus. While 95 percent of first-year students live on campus, only 50 percent of upperclassmen live on campus, instead choosing to live in homes and apartments surrounding the college.

===Campus Town===
In 2013, groundbreaking began for The Campus Town complex. Consisting of seven buildings — Campus Town Clock Tower, apartments and recreation space — Campus Town was built by PRC Campus Centers LLC on 12 acres of property located on campus and it has 80,000 square feet of commercial space.

The Campus Town complex has space to house 446 juniors and seniors in one-, two- and four-bedroom apartments. Each apartment has a living room/dining area, separate bedrooms, one or two bathrooms depending upon the unit, a full kitchen with a dishwasher and a full-sized washer and dryer.

The Campus Town complex houses an 11,500-square-foot fitness center that replaced the college&#x27;s 4,000-square-foot gym. The apartments and the fitness center are only open to the students, but the complex&#x27;s retail stores are open to the public. Barnes &amp; Noble is an anchor tenant, with a 14,000-square-foot store. Other facilities include Panera, Jersey Mike&#x27;s, a yogurt shop, sushi restaurant, convenience store and brewpub.

===Entrepreneurship===

In the mid-2000s, TCNJ began to put a more concentrated effort on student entrepreneurship. Administrative resources were put toward counselling and workshops for students. The Mayo Business Plan Competition in April 2012 saw numerous student groups competing for $12,000 to launch their start-up businesses. The school has also held entrepreneurship events for local high school students.

===Student life===

Greek life at TCNJ is governed by the Inter-Greek Council. The Inter-Greek Council recognizes 30 organizations; 16 sororities, 12 fraternities, and 3 coed organizations.

===Brower Student Center===
The Brower Student Center (BSC) is the student center on campus; it was named after former president Clayton R. Brower. The BSC was built in 1976. The building is home to all of the student organizations on campus, as well as some dining facilities.

===Museums and exhibits===
The College of New Jersey is home to the David Sarnoff Museum, formerly located at Princeton Junction. The collection detailing the life of NBC founder David Sarnoff is now located in Roscoe L. West Hall. Various art exhibits can be found in galleries at the Art and IMM building. The exhibits feature the work of student artists, professional artists and local artists. The exhibits are updated regularly.

===Campus media===
==== Publications ====
The Signal has been The College of New Jersey&#x27;s student-run newspaper since 1855. It has won numerous awards, and has placed first many times in the General Excellence category (the highest category) for collegiate news publications at the New Jersey Press Association awards. The Signal is run almost entirely out of their office located on AIMM&#x27;s second floor.

TCNJ Magazine is another publication, covering both current campus life and alumni affairs. The Perspective, an openly left-leaning student news booklet, is the school&#x27;s newest publication having been first published in 2009. The Perspective received funding from the Student Finance Board, but so far has no established publishing schedule (as opposed to other campus publications). On the literary side, &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Eye&quot; and &quot;The Siren&quot; are both student-made magazines filled with poetry, prose and artwork by students. The Seal was TCNJ&#x27;s yearbook since its first publication in 1911. However, following the 2017 edition, the publication and student organization were discontinued due to low demand and incumbent debt.
==== Radio ====
WTSR (91.3 FM) is the college&#x27;s non-commercial radio station which services Mercer County and Bucks County, Pennsylvania while also broadcasting over the internet. The station began in 1958 as WTSC, but was approved for an FM license in the fall of 1965. The station is fully student run and enlists the help of both students and community volunteers. The station offers traditional dayside programming while also offering a variety of specialty programming that consists of shows featuring folk/world, synth-pop, modern rock, metal, reggae, oldies, gospel, and more.

==== Television ====
Lions Television (abbreviated &#x27;LTV&#x27;) has been the student run television station on campus since 2008. Its studio and office are located in Kendall Hall and its content can be viewed online or on campus televisions on channel 2-2. The station board includes six producers (sports, news, music, comedy, pop culture and game show) who film, direct and edit content both in studio and around the school&#x27;s campus.

==Athletics==


The College of New Jersey has 22 varsity teams and 18 club teams, including multiple programs that have achieved national recognition and success. Its varsity teams are members of the New Jersey Athletic Conference (NJAC) and compete in Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The college&#x27;s mascot is &quot;Roscoe the Lion.&quot;

TCNJ&#x27;s varsity teams are the top combined first- and second-place finishers of all 424 Division III schools in the nation over more than 25 years.

The women&#x27;s lacrosse team has played in the championship game 16 out of 20 possible times, winning 11 (though the 1992 title was later vacated) and qualifying for the NCAA tournament 21 consecutive times through 2005, highlighted by a 93–1 record from 1991 to 1996. The women&#x27;s field hockey team has won 10 Division III crowns in 14 championship appearances (both twice as many as any other school).

The TCNJ men&#x27;s soccer team won the 1996 National Championship and was the National Championship Runner-up in 1997.

The TCNJ wrestling team has placed in the top 20 nationally for 30 consecutive years, including 5 national championships (1979, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1987), 5 runner-up finishes, and numerous finishes in the top 5.

The track and field teams have also dominated the New Jersey Athletic Conference. Since the NJAC title was first contested in 1997, TCNJ has won the title — both indoor and outdoor — each year.

The main athletic facility, Lions Stadium, holds 6,000 spectators and is home to the football, field hockey, lacrosse, and intramural teams. The stadium opened in the fall of 1984 and featured the first North American installation of AstroTurf&#x27;s vertical-drainage system. This system prevents the &quot;duck-pond effect&quot; commonly seen with other artificial surfaces. In 2008, reports indicated that the turf contained higher-than-acceptable levels of lead and was subsequently removed. Now, the stadium is furnished with &quot;Tiger Turf&quot;, which is the first installation of the &quot;Trophy Turf&quot; in the United States. The stadium has hosted multiple NCAA tournaments and championship games, as well as the annual Special Olympics New Jersey and the annual USSBA Central Jersey Regional marching band competition.

The school&#x27;s club ice hockey team have found success as a member of multiple American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) conferences since the group&#x27;s creation in 1977. The team currently plays in the Colonial State College Hockey Conference where it began play as a founding member in 2014, has won four conference championships (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020), and earned bids to the ACHA Southeast Regional Tournament. Prior to this as a member of the Great Northeast Collegiate Hockey Conference the team won two conference titles in 2012 and 2014.

The TCNJ cheerleading team has found success in the collegiate cheerleading world since its inception in 2000. In 2014, 2015, 2019, and 2020, the program was recognized as National Champions at Universal Cheerleaders Association&#x27;s College championship.

<text>Mest is an American rock band originally formed by lead vocalist and guitarist Tony Lovato, bassist Matt Lovato, drummer Nick Gigler, and guitarist Jeremiah Rangel. They broke up in 2006 after eleven years, but temporarily reformed in California in 2008 for a &quot;final tour.&quot; Tony released “Not What You Expected” in 2013 and it was announced in 2018 that the classic lineup of Mest, with Tony Lovato, Matt Lovato, Nick Gigler, and Jeremiah Rangel, would be getting back together to track Masquerade.

==History==
Cousins Matt Lovato and Tony Lovato formed the band together in October 1995. The band&#x27;s last guitarist, Jeremiah Rangel, joined the band in 1998. Their previous guitarist was Steve Lovato, Tony Lovato&#x27;s brother. Nick Gigler joined the band in 1997.

In 1998, the band self-released &quot;Mo&#x27; Money, Mo&#x27; 40z&quot;. Their debut album on Maverick Records, &quot;Wasting Time&quot;, was released in July 2000 and &quot;Destination Unknown&quot; in 2001. They toured as an opening band for Goldfinger on July 20, 2002, in Las Vegas and then a few months later, released a DVD called &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot; in January 2003. Later that same year, the band released their self-titled album, which featured the single &quot;Jaded (These Years)&quot;, featuring Benji Madden of Good Charlotte.

In 2005, a tour with Social Distortion was cut short when drummer Nick Gigler required surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome in his wrists which was affecting his drumming. The band&#x27;s last album, &quot;Photographs&quot;, was released October 18, 2005.

In January 2006, the band announced on their MySpace blog that they would break-up following a U.S. tour. The tour ran from late January until early March, with support from Allister and Scary Kids Scaring Kids.

Mest played a reunion show at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California, on April 17, 2008. In response, Nick Gigler posted a bulletin through his personal MySpace and confirmed that he would not be taking part, and that he had called Jeremiah Rangel and Matt Lovato, who had confirmed that they would not be appearing with Tony either.
After the one-off &quot;One Night Stand&quot; show, Tony decided to rebuild Mest and go on a monthlong tour, with help from Chris Wilson (Good Charlotte, The Summer Obsession), and his brother and founding member, Steve Lovato (at the time in Room One Eleven). Although Matt showed interest, he and Jeremiah were both reported to be too busy with other commitments to join. Nick and Tony had not been on speaking terms since the band broke up. The trek took place in October and November 2008, and featured Quietdrive, Rookie of the Year, and Automatic Loveletter.

Mest went on a European tour in spring 2012 with its current members, Mike Longworth and Richie Gonzales, and also toured the US with Escape the Fate and Attack Attack in 2012.

Mest released their album &quot;Not What You Expected&quot; in September 2013, written and recorded with Richie Gonzales and Mike Longworth, making it available for free to download from their website. Mest played 3 dates on the Warped Tour 2013. They self-released another album in 2014, entitled &quot;Broken Down&quot;.

On October 25, 2018, Mest officially announced that they had signed with El Hefe, from NOFX&#x27;s label Cyber Trax Records and a new album with the original lineup would be released in spring 2019. A single entitled &quot;Masquerade&quot; was uploaded to YouTube in July 2019, accompanied by an announcement to the effect that a new album would be released in the fall of that year, produced by Cameron Webb.

Mest&#x27;s album &quot;Masquerade&quot; was released on January 17, 2020.

On April 12, 2024, Mest released a new song called &quot;When We Were Young&quot; featuring Jaret Reddick of Bowling For Soup. At this time the band also announced that their upcoming album will be called &quot;Youth&quot; and is set to be released May 31, 2024.

<text>The Show Must Go Off! is a live concert DVD series produced by Kung Fu Films, an offshoot of the Kung Fu Records label, which began in 2002. The producer was Vandals bassist Joe Escalante. As of 2005, the series featured at least 19 &quot;episodes&quot;. The series features punk rock and pop punk bands from various eras – from older groups that were popular in the 1980s and 1990s, to more recent acts.

The series title &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot; was first used for the recorded performance by Mest at the House of Blues, which was later re-labeled as &quot;Episode 2&quot; in the series, while the Vandals Christmas DVD released in 2002 became known as &quot;Episode 1.&quot; 

In later installments, numerous special features were incorporated into the DVD releases. Episode 9, The Vandals &quot;Live at the House of Blues&quot; was recorded using eight cameras, including a &quot;Josh Freese cam&quot; with a picture-in-picture close-up of the drummer&#x27;s foot-pedal. The DVD also included optional subtitles for the lyrics, and commentary from band members.

<doc id="180018" wikidata="Q1330968" url="?curid=180018" title="Ulster Defence Association">
<text>The Ulster Defence Association (UDA) is an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. It was formed in September 1971 as an umbrella group for various loyalist groups and undertook an armed campaign of almost 24 years as one of the participants of the Troubles. Its declared goal was to defend Ulster Protestant loyalist areas and to combat Irish republicanism, particularly the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). In the 1970s, uniformed UDA members openly patrolled these areas armed with batons and held large marches and rallies. Within the UDA was a group tasked with launching paramilitary attacks that used the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) so that the UDA would not be outlawed. The British government proscribed the UFF as a terrorist group in November 1973, but the UDA itself was not proscribed until August 1992.

The UDA/UFF were responsible for more than 400 deaths. The vast majority of its victims were Irish Catholic civilians, killed at random, in what the group called retaliation for IRA actions or attacks on Protestants. High-profile attacks carried out by the group include the Top of the Hill bar shooting, the Milltown massacre, the Sean Graham&#x27;s and James Murray&#x27;s bookmakers&#x27; shootings, the Castlerock killings, killings of Paddy Wilson and Irene Andrews and the Greysteel massacre. Most of its attacks were in Northern Ireland, but from 1972 onward it also carried out bombings in the Republic of Ireland. The UDA/UFF declared a ceasefire in 1994 and ended its campaign in 2007, but some of its members have continued to engage in violence. The other main Loyalist paramilitary group during the conflict was the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). All three groups are proscribed organisations in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000.

==History==
The Ulster Defence Association emerged from a series of meetings during the middle of 1971 of loyalist &quot;vigilante&quot; groups called &quot;defence associations&quot;. The largest of these were the Shankill and Woodvale Defence Associations, with other groups based in East Belfast, Lower Shankill and Roden Street.

===UDA formation===
The first meeting, in September 1971, was chaired by Billy Hull, with Alan Moon of the lower Shankill as its vice-chair. Moon was quickly replaced by Jim Anderson. Moon, who had become reluctant to be involved in vigilantism since the group&#x27;s formation, willingly stepped aside and ended his association with the UDA soon afterwards. The structure of this new movement soon took shape with a thirteen-man Security Council established in January 1972 as a reaction to a Provisional IRA bomb the previous month at the Balmoral furniture showroom on the Shankill which killed four people including two infants.

By this point, Charles Harding Smith had become the group&#x27;s leader, with former Royal Army Ordnance Corps soldier Davy Fogel as his second-in-command, who trained the new recruits in military tactics, the use of guns, and unarmed combat. Its most prominent early spokesperson was Tommy Herron; however, Andy Tyrie would emerge as leader soon after. Its original motto was &quot;Cedenta Arma Togae&quot; (&quot;Law before violence&quot;) and it was a legal organisation until it was banned by the British government on 10 August 1992. Under Smith&#x27;s command, the UDA was organised along paramilitary lines into battalions, companies, platoons and sections. The organisation drew more members, becoming the largest loyalist paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland. Unlike its principal rival, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), the UDA was legal.

In April 1972, the organisation&#x27;s leader, Charles Harding Smith and leading UDA member John White were arrested in London for gun-trafficking. A temporary &quot;de facto&quot; leadership assumed control and Anderson became the acting chairman of the UDA.

At the end of May 1972, Fogel, by then the leader of B Company and Harding Smith&#x27;s second-in-command, erected the first UDA roadblocks and street barricades, making Woodvale, the area under Fogel&#x27;s command, a no-go area. The operation attracted a great deal of media and press coverage, resulting in much publicity for the UDA. British Army troops under the command of Major-General Robert Ford were sent to the area, where a stand-off with the UDA ensued. Leading UDA figures eventually entered into street negotiations with senior Army officers, where it was eventually agreed that the UDA could erect small temporary barriers in Loyalist neighbourhoods. That summer, the UDA marched through the streets of central Belfast in a massive demonstration of strength.

In December 1972, Harding Smith and White were acquitted and returned to Belfast. Immediately after their return, a fierce power struggle ensued after Harding Smith declared to his associates: &quot;I&#x27;m the boss. I take orders from no one&quot;. Fogel was promptly ousted from the B Company command, while the formidable East Belfast brigadier, Tommy Herron, appeared on the scene to challenge Harding Smith&#x27;s leadership. Anderson became joint chairman of the UDA with Harding Smith. The struggle that ensued between Harding Smith and Herron overshadowed the Inner Council and during the height of the feud Anderson often had to call a register at its meetings, so poor were the turnouts. Herron and Anderson became linked and the East Belfast brigadier took to styling himself as deputy leader to Anderson, whom he treated as sole chairman.

By spring 1973, however, Fogel had already returned to his native England, and Anderson decided to stand down. He publicly announced his resignation as joint chairman in March 1973, in part because he was a fairly law-abiding individual who sat uneasily with violently chaotic figures like Harding Smith and Herron. It had been Anderson who had been one of the main thinkers behind the UDA&#x27;s motto &quot;Law Before Violence&quot; although this was ditched shortly after his resignation in favour of &quot;Quis separabit&quot;. As a compromise candidate between the rival factions of Harding Smith and Herron, Andy Tyrie, commander of West Belfast Brigade&#x27;s A Company, was chosen as the UDA&#x27;s chairman. He would soon become the UDA&#x27;s Supreme Commander, a position he held until an attempted car bombing brought about his retirement in March 1988.

Early in its history the UDA was closely associated with the Vanguard movement led by William Craig and it was regularly described as the &quot;military wing&quot; of Vanguard. At a rally in Lisburn in February 1972, Craig inspected uniformed ranks of UDA members. Craig issued a warning during a rally at Ormeau Park the next month, where thousands of UDA men were present: &quot;If the politicians fail us, it might become our responsibility to eliminate the enemy.&quot; However, by 1979 the UDA had turned on Craig over his increasingly conciliatory approach to Nationalists and condemnation of the 1977 loyalist strike, leading the UDA to instead back Peter Robinson in that year&#x27;s general election.

===Membership===

At its peak of strength it held around forty thousand members, mostly part-time. During this period of legality, the UDA committed a large number of attacks using the name Ulster Freedom Fighters, including the murder of Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) politician Paddy Wilson and his companion Irene Andrews in 1973. The UDA was involved in the successful Ulster Workers Council Strike in 1974, which brought down the Sunningdale Agreement: a power-sharing agreement for Northern Ireland, which some unionists thought conceded too much to nationalist demands. The UDA enforced this general strike through widespread intimidation across Northern Ireland. The strike was led by VUPP Assemblyman and UDA member, Glenn Barr.

The UDA were often referred to by the nickname &quot;Wombles&quot; by their rivals, mainly the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). The nickname is derived from the furry fictional children&#x27;s TV creatures The Wombles, and was given to the UDA because many of its members wore fur-trimmed parkas. Its headquarters is in Gawn Street, off the Newtownards Road in east Belfast, and its current motto is &quot;Quis Separabit&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;Who will separate [us]?&quot;.

=== Women&#x27;s units ===
The UDA had several women&#x27;s units, which were independent of each other. Although they occasionally helped staff roadblocks, the women&#x27;s units were typically involved in local community work and responsible for the assembly and delivery of food parcels to UDA prisoners. This was a source of pride for the UDA. The first women&#x27;s unit was founded on the Shankill Road by Wendy &quot;Bucket&quot; Millar, whose sons Herbie and James &quot;Sham&quot; Millar would later become prominent UDA members. The UDA women&#x27;s department was headed by Jean Moore, who also came from the Shankill Road. She had also served as the president of the women&#x27;s auxiliary of the Loyalist Association of Workers. Her brother Ingram &quot;Jock&quot; Beckett, one of the UDA&#x27;s founding members, had been killed in March 1972 by a rival UDA faction in an internal dispute. Moore was succeeded by Hester Dunn of east Belfast, who also ran the public relations and administration section at the UDA headquarters. Wendy Millar&#x27;s Shankill Road group was a particularly active women&#x27;s unit, and another was based in Sandy Row, south Belfast, a traditional UDA stronghold. The latter was commanded by Elizabeth &quot;Lily&quot; Douglas. Her teenaged daughter, Elizabeth was one of the members.

The Sandy Row women&#x27;s UDA unit was disbanded after it carried out a vicious &quot;romper room&quot; punishment beating on 24 July 1974 which left 32-year-old Ann Ogilby dead. The body of Ogilby, a Protestant single mother who had an affair with the husband of one of the unit&#x27;s members, was found in a ditch five days later. The day of the fatal beating Ogilby was abducted and forced upstairs to the first floor of a disused bakery in Sandy Row that had been converted into a UDA club. Two teenage girls, Henrietta Cowan and Christine Smith, acting under Elizabeth Douglas&#x27; orders to give Ogilby a &quot;good rompering&quot;, punched, kicked, then battered her to death with bricks and sticks; the autopsy later revealed that Ogilby had suffered 24 blows to the head and body. The killing, which was carried out within earshot of Ogilby&#x27;s six-year-old daughter, caused widespread revulsion throughout Northern Ireland and was condemned by the UDA prisoners serving inside the Maze Prison. None of the other UDA women&#x27;s units had consented to or been aware of the fatal punishment beating until it was reported in the news. Douglas, Cowan, and Smith were convicted of the murder and sentenced to imprisonment at Armagh Women&#x27;s Jail. Seven other members of the women&#x27;s unit and a UDA man were also convicted for their part in the murder. The UDA &quot;romper rooms&quot;, named after the children&#x27;s television programme, were places where victims were beaten and tortured prior to being killed. This was known as a &quot;rompering&quot;. The &quot;romper rooms&quot; were normally located in disused buildings, lock-up garages, warehouses, and rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. The use of the &quot;romper rooms&quot; was a more common practice among male members of the UDA than their female counterparts.

=== Paramilitary campaign ===


Starting in 1972 the UDA along with the other main Loyalist paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force, undertook an armed campaign against the Catholic population of Northern Ireland that would last until the end of the troubles. In May 1972, the UDA&#x27;s pressured leader Tommy Herron decided that responsibility for acts of violence committed by the UDA would be claimed by the &quot;UFF&quot;. Its first public statements came one month later.

The UDA&#x27;s official position during the Troubles was that if the Provisional Irish Republican Army (Provisional IRA) called off its campaign of violence, then it would do the same. However, if the British government announced that it was withdrawing from Northern Ireland, then the UDA would act as &quot;the IRA in reverse.&quot;

Active throughout the Troubles, its armed campaign gained prominence in the early 1990s through Johnny Adair&#x27;s ruthless leadership of the Lower Shankill 2nd Battalion, C. Company, which resulted in a greater degree of tactical independence for individual brigades. C. Company&#x27;s hit squad, led by Stephen McKeag, became notorious for a campaign of random murders of Catholic civilians in the first half of the 1990s.

They benefited, along with the Ulster Volunteer Force, and a group called Ulster Resistance (set up by the Democratic Unionist Party), from a shipment of arms imported from Lebanon in 1988. The weapons landed included rocket launchers, 200 rifles, 90 pistols and over 400 grenades. Although almost two–thirds of these weapons were later recovered by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), they enabled the UDA to launch an assassination campaign against their perceived enemies.


North Belfast UDA brigadier Davy Payne was arrested after his &quot;scout&quot; car had been stopped at a RUC checkpoint and large caches of the weaponry were discovered in the boots of his associates&#x27; cars. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison.

In 1992, Brian Nelson, a prominent UDA member who served as the organisation&#x27;s intelligence chief, was arrested by the Stevens Inquiry Team. It was subsequently uncovered that he was also an agent of the Force Research Unit (FRU), an undercover Intelligence Corps unit. Over a period of two months, Nelson dictated a police statement covering 650 pages. He claimed that he had been tasked by his FRU handlers with transforming the UDA into a more effective force, particularly at carrying out killings. Using information supplied by his handlers, Nelson produced dossiers on proposed targets, which were passed on to UDA hitmen. Nelson was subsequently sentenced to 10 years in prison.

One of the most high-profile UDA attacks came in October 1993, when three masked men attacked a restaurant called the Rising Sun in the predominantly Catholic village of Greysteel, County Londonderry, where two hundred people were celebrating Halloween. The two men entered and opened fire. Eight people, including six Catholics and two Protestants were killed and nineteen wounded in what became known as the Greysteel massacre. The &quot;UFF&quot; claimed the attack was in retaliation to the IRA&#x27;s Shankill Road bombing, which killed nine people seven days earlier.

According to the Sutton database of deaths at the University of Ulster&#x27;s CAIN project, the UDA was responsible for 259 killings during the Troubles. 220 of its victims were civilians (predominantly Catholics), 37 were other loyalist paramilitaries (including 30 of its own members), three were members of the security forces and 11 were republican paramilitaries. According to the Stevens Enquiry, a number of these attacks were carried out with the assistance or complicity of elements of the British security forces. The preferred modus operandi of the UDA was individual killings of civilian targets in nationalist areas, rather than large-scale bomb or mortar attacks.

The UDA employed various codewords whenever they claimed their attacks. These included: &quot;The Crucible&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Ulster Troubles&quot; and &quot;Captain Black&quot;.

===Post-ceasefire activities===
Its ceasefire was welcomed by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, and the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Hugh Orde.

Since the ceasefire, the UDA has been accused of taking vigilante action against alleged rival drug dealers, including tarring and feathering a man on the Taughmonagh estate in south Belfast. It has also been involved in several feuds with the UVF, which led to many killings. The UDA has also been riddled by its own internecine warfare, with self-styled &quot;brigadiers&quot; and former figures of power and influence, such as Johnny Adair and Jim Gray (themselves bitter rivals), falling rapidly in and out of favour with the rest of the leadership. Gray and John Gregg are amongst those to have been killed during the internal strife. On 22 February 2003, the UDA announced a &quot;12-month period of military inactivity&quot;. It said it would review its ceasefire every three months. The UPRG&#x27;s Frankie Gallagher has since taken a leading role in ending the association between the UDA and drug dealing.

Following an August 2005 &quot;Sunday World&quot; article that poked fun at the gambling losses of one of its leaders, the UDA banned the sale of the newspaper from shops in areas it controls. Shops that defy the ban have suffered arson attacks, and at least one newsagent was threatened with death. The Police Service of Northern Ireland began accompanying the paper&#x27;s delivery vans. The UDA was also considered to have played an instrumental role in loyalist riots in Belfast in September 2005.

On 13 November 2005 the UDA announced that it would &quot;consider its future&quot;, in the wake of the standing down of the Provisional IRA and Loyalist Volunteer Force.

In February 2006, the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) reported UDA involvement in organised crime, drug trafficking, counterfeiting, extortion, money laundering and robbery.

On 20 June 2006, the UDA expelled Andre Shoukri and his brother Ihab, two of its senior members who were heavily involved in organised crime. Some saw this as a sign that the UDA was slowly coming away from crime. The move did see the southeast Antrim brigade of the UDA, which had been at loggerheads with the leadership for some time, support Shoukri and break away under former UPRG spokesman Tommy Kirkham. Other senior members met with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern for talks on 13 July in the same year.

On 11 November 2007 the UDA announced that the Ulster Freedom Fighters would be stood down from midnight of the same day, with its weapons &quot;being put beyond use&quot; although it stressed that these would not be decommissioned.

Although the group expressed a willingness to move from criminal activity to &quot;community development&quot;, the IMC said it saw little evidence of this move because of the views of its members and the lack of coherence in the group&#x27;s leadership as a result of its decentralised structure. While the report indicated the leadership intends to move towards its stated goals, factionalism hindered this change and was the strongest hindrance to progress. Although most loyalist actions were curtailed since the IMC&#x27;s previous report, most of loyalist paramilitary activity was coming from the UDA.

The IMC report concluded that the leadership&#x27;s willingness to change has resulted in community tension and the group would continue to be monitored, although &quot;the mainstream UDA still has some way to go.&quot; Furthermore, the IMC warned the group to &quot;recognise that the organisation&#x27;s time as a paramilitary group has passed and that decommissioning is inevitable.&quot; Decommissioning was said to be the &quot;biggest outstanding issue for loyalist leaders, although not the only one.&quot;

On 6 January 2010, the UDA announced that it had put its weapons &quot;verifiably beyond use&quot;. The decommissioning was completed five weeks before a government amnesty deadline beyond which any weapons found could have been used as evidence for a prosecution. The decommissioning was confirmed by Canadian General John de Chastelain, chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, as well as Lord Eames, former Archbishop of Armagh and Sir George Quigley, former top civil servant.

Chastelain stated that the decommissioning included arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices and the UDA stated that the arms &quot;constitute the totality of those under their control&quot;. Following the decommissioning the Ulster Political Research Group, the UDA&#x27;s political representatives, stated that the &quot;Ulster Defence Association was formed to defend our communities; we state quite clearly and categorically that this responsibility now rests with the Government and its institutions where legitimacy resides&quot;. UDA representative Frankie Gallagher also stated that the group now regretted being responsible for the killing of more than 400 people.

Shaun Woodward, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, stated that this &quot;is a major act of leadership by the UDA and further comprehensive evidence of the success of politics over violence in Northern Ireland&quot; and the act was also welcomed by Sinn Féin and DUP politicians. The President of the Republic of Ireland, Mary McAleese, described the decommissioning as &quot;a very positive milestone on the journey of peace&quot;. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also welcomed the move as a step towards lasting peace in Northern Ireland.

===South East Antrim group===
This area also continues to use the &quot;UDA&quot; title in its name, although it too expressed willingness to move towards &quot;community development&quot;. Although serious crime is not prevalent among its members, some who were arrested for illegal drug sales and &quot;extortion&quot; were exiled by the Brigade. A clear distinction between the factions was not available in the 20th IMC report, as this was the first report to differentiate between the two.

== Politics ==

In the 1970s the group favoured Northern Ireland independence, but they have retreated from this position.

The New Ulster Political Research Group (NUPRG) was initially the political wing of the UDA, founded in 1978, which then evolved into the Ulster Loyalist Democratic Party in 1981 under the leadership of John McMichael, a prominent UDA member killed by the IRA in 1987, amid suspicion that he was set up to be killed by some of his UDA colleagues.

In 1987, the UDA&#x27;s deputy commander John McMichael (who was then the leader of the UFF) promoted a document entitled &quot;Common Sense&quot;, which promoted a consensual end to the conflict in Northern Ireland, while maintaining the Union. The document advocated a power-sharing assembly involving both nationalists and unionists, an agreed constitution and new Bill of Rights. It is not clear, however, whether this programme was adopted by the UDA as their official policy. However, the killing of McMichael that same year and the subsequent removal of Tyrie from the leadership and his replacement with an Inner Council saw the UDA concentrate on stockpiling weapons rather than political ideas.

In 1989, the ULDP changed its name to the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP). It finally dissolved itself in 2001 following very limited electoral success and internal difficulties. Gary McMichael, son of John McMichael, was the last leader of the UDP, which supported the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. The Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG) was subsequently formed to give political analysis to the UDA and act as community workers in loyalist areas. It is currently represented on the Belfast City Council.

In early January 1994, the UDA released a document calling for ethnic cleansing and repartition, with the goal of making a new Northern Ireland which would have been wholly Protestant. The plan was to be implemented should the British Army withdraw from Northern Ireland. Areas in the south and west with strong Catholic/nationalist majorities would be handed over to the Republic, and those Catholics left stranded in the &quot;Protestant state&quot; would be &quot;expelled, nullified, or interned&quot;. The story was printed in &quot;The Sunday Independent&quot; newspaper on 16 January. The &quot;doomsday plan&quot; was based on the work of Dr Liam Kennedy, a lecturer at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast who in 1986 had published a book called &quot;Two Ulsters: A Case for Repartition&quot;, although it did not call for ethnic cleansing. The UDP&#x27;s Raymond Smallwoods said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t consulted but the scenario set out is a perfectly plausible one&quot;. The DUP&#x27;s Sammy Wilson stated that the plan &quot;shows that some loyalist paramilitaries are looking ahead and contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate Ulster identity&quot;

== Support from other groups ==

The UDA had links with Neo-Nazi groups in Britain—specifically Combat 18 (formed in 1992) and the British National Socialist Movement (formed in 1985). Members of these groups helped to smuggle weapons for the UDA. The UDA has received backing from Combat 18, the National Front and the British National Party. The links may not have been politically motivated, but for mutually beneficial arms deals. On one occasion the UDA sent Louis Scott, one of a few black members of the UDA, to make the transaction. Johnny Adair, who had been in Combat 18 before the UDA, established stronger links once he became a brigadier.

The Red Hand Defenders is a cover name used by breakaway factions of the UDA and the LVF. The term was coined in 1997 when members of the LVF carried out attacks on behalf of Johnny Adair&#x27;s &quot;UFF 2nd Battalion, &#x27;C&#x27; Company (Shankill Road)&quot; and vice versa. The relationship between the UDA (specifically Adair&#x27;s West Belfast Brigade, not the wider leadership of the UDA) was initially formed after the death of Billy Wright, the previous leader of the LVF, and grew from Adair&#x27;s personal friendship with Mark &#x27;Swinger&#x27; Fulton, the organisation&#x27;s new chief.

The necessity for a cover name resulted from the need to avoid tensions between the UDA and the UVF, the organisation from which the LVF had broken away. It was perceived that any open co-operation between the UDA and the LVF would anger the UVF, something which proved to be the case in following years and resulted in a loyalist feud. There has been debate as to whether or not the Red Hand Defenders have become an entity in their own right made up of dissident factions from both the UDA and the LVF (both of which have now declared ceasefires whilst the RHD has not), although much intelligence has been based on the claims of responsibility which, as has been suggested, are frequently misleading.

A 1985 MI5 assessment reported that 85% of the UDA&#x27;s &quot;targeting material&quot; came from security force records.

Scotland was a source of fundraising and other types of aid. Former MI5 agent Willie Carlin said: &quot;There were safe houses in Glasgow and Stirling. The ferry [between Scotland and Northern Ireland] was pivotal in getting arms into the north—and anything like checkpoints, or armed police and Army in Scotland would have b******d that all up.&quot; An Irish government memo written by David Donoghue stated: &quot;The commonest contribution of Scots UDA and UVF is to send gelignite. Explosives for the north were mostly shipped in small boats which set out at night from the Scottish coast and made contact at sea with vessels from Ulster ports.&quot; Donoghue noted the links between Orange Lodges in Scotland and loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland and that membership of the Orange Order in Scotland at the time was 80,000, and was concentrated in Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Inverness. The Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee noted in its report that &quot;in 1992 it was estimated that Scottish support for the UDA and UVF might amount to £100,000 a year.&quot;

Protestants in Canada also supported the loyalist paramilitaries in the conflict. Sociologist Steven Bruce described the support networks in Canada as &quot;the main source of support for loyalism outside the United Kingdom ... Ontario is to Ulster Protestants what Boston is to Irish Catholics.&quot; After the Troubles began, an Orange-Canadian loyalist organization known as the Canadian Ulster Loyalist Association (CULA) provided the &#x27;besieged&#x27; Protestants with the resources to arm themselves. A Canadian branch of the UDA also existed and sent $30,000 to the UDA&#x27;s headquarters in Belfast by 1975. In 1972, five Toronto businessmen shipped weapons in grain container ships out of Halifax, bound for ports in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland which were destined for loyalist militants. 

Between 1979 and 1986, Canadian supporters supplied the UVF/UDA with 100 machine guns and thousands of rifles, grenade launchers, magnum revolvers, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition. These shipments were considered enough for the UVF/UDA to wage its campaign, most of which were used to kill its victims. On 10 February 1976, following the sudden uptick of violence against Catholic civilians by loyalist militants, Irish cardinal William Conway and nine other Catholic bishops met with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his cabinet, asking them as to where the loyalist militants had acquired guns, to which Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees replied &quot;Canada&quot;.

==Structure and leadership==
The UDA is made up of:
* the Inner Council
* the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF)—whose role was to carry out attacks on republican and nationalist targets. However, many regard the UFF as merely a covername used when the UDA wished to claim responsibility for attacks.
* the Ulster Defence Force (UDF)—whose role was to give &quot;specialist military training&quot; to a select group of UDA members. The UDF was initiated by John McMichael (the then UDA/UFF commander) in 1985 as a response to the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The UDF operated training camps in rural parts of Northern Ireland that young loyalists such as Johnny Adair claim to have attended. One reported &#x27;survival&#x27; training technique was to leave trainees stranded in Dublin with only £1. The training, which was described by UDA members as forming &quot;the nucleus of a new loyalist army at the ready&quot;, was made possible thanks to &quot;a sophisticated network of legal businesses&quot; which allowed for the implementation of ambitious training programmes.
* the Ulster Young Militants (UYM)—the &quot;youth wing&quot; of the group. Formed in 1973.
* the Ulster Political Research Group (UPRG)—the UDA&#x27;s &quot;political advisory body&quot;. Formed in 1978.

The UDA operated a devolved structure of leadership, each with a brigadier representing one of its six &quot;brigade areas&quot;. It is not clear whether this brigade structure has been maintained in the UDA&#x27;s post cease-fire state. The UDA&#x27;s six &quot;brigade areas&quot; were:
* North Belfast
* East Belfast
* South Belfast, the UDA&#x27;s largest brigade area, covering all of South Belfast down to Lisburn and operating as far away as South County Down, Lurgan, Portadown and Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh.
* West Belfast
* Southeast [County] Antrim
* North County Antrim &amp; County Londonderry
In addition to these six core brigades two others may have existed. A seventh Mid-Ulster Brigade is mentioned by Steve Bruce as having existed for part of the UDA&#x27;s history although Henry McDonald and Jim Cusack characterise this as a &quot;battalion&quot; rather than a brigade and suggest that its rural location prevented it from fully developing. In the late 1970s a Scottish Brigade was established under the command of Roddy McDonald but this proved short-lived. The security forces infiltrated this brigade almost immediately and in 1979 arrested almost its entire membership, ninety people in all. Six members received particularly lengthy prison sentences for their involvement in UDA activities in Perth and the Scottish Brigade quietly disappeared.

Some of the notable brigadiers include:

Jackie McDonald—South Belfast (~1980s–present)
Resident of the Taughmonagh estate in South Belfast. McDonald was a cautious supporter of the UDA&#x27;s ceasefire and a harsh critic of Johnny &#x27;Mad Dog&#x27; Adair during his final years of membership of the organisation. McDonald remains the only brigadier who did not have a commonly used nickname.

Johnny &#x27;Mad Dog&#x27; Adair—West Belfast (1990–2002)
An active figure in the UDA/UFF, Adair rose to notoriety in the early 1990s when he led the &quot;2nd Battalion, C Company&quot; unit in West Belfast which was responsible for one of the bloodiest killing sprees of the Troubles.

Jim &#x27;Doris Day&#x27; Gray—East Belfast (1992–2005) An unlikely figure in Northern Ireland loyalism, the openly bisexual Gray was a controversial figure in the organisation until his death on 4 October 2005. Always flamboyantly dressed, Gray was a key figure in the UDA&#x27;s negotiations with Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid. It is widely believed that Gray received his nickname from the RUC Special Branch.

Jimbo &#x27;Bacardi Brigadier&#x27; Simpson—North Belfast (Unknown–2002) Simpson is believed to have been an alcoholic, hence his nickname. He was leader of the UDA in the volatile North Belfast area, an interface between Catholics and Protestants in the New Lodge and Tiger&#x27;s Bay neighbourhoods.

Billy &#x27;The Mexican&#x27; McFarland—North Antrim and Londonderry (Unknown–2013) He earned his nickname because of his moustache and swarthy appearance, and had overall command of the UDA&#x27;s North Antrim and Londonderry brigade at the time of the Good Friday Agreement. He supported the leadership against Johnny Adair and has been associated with the magazine &#x27;Warrior&#x27;, which makes the case for Ulster Independence.

Andre &#x27;The Egyptian&#x27; Shoukri—North Belfast (2002–2005) Initially a close ally of Johnny Adair, Shoukri and his brother Ihab became involved with the UDA in his native North Belfast. The son of an Egyptian father and a Northern Irish mother, he was expelled from the UDA in 2005 following allegations of criminality.

John &#x27;Grug&#x27; Gregg—South East Antrim (c.1993–2003) John &#x27;Grug&#x27; Gregg was a man with a fearsome reputation within the loyalist movement, known as a &quot;Hawk&quot; in loyalist circles, and controlled the streets of south east Antrim. On 14 March 1984, he severely wounded Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams in an assassination attempt for which he was jailed. When asked by the BBC in prison if he regretted anything about the shooting, his reply was &quot;only that I didn&#x27;t succeed.&quot; He was killed on Belfast&#x27;s Nelson Street, along with another UDA member (Rab Carson), while travelling in a taxi from the docks in 2003, and the murder was blamed on supporters of Johnny Adair, who had recently been expelled from the UDA in 2002.

==Deaths as a result of activity==

Malcolm Sutton&#x27;s &quot;Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland&quot;, part of the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), states that the UDA/UFF was responsible for at least 260 killings, and lists a further 256 loyalist killings that have not yet been attributed to a particular group. According to the book &quot;Lost Lives&quot; (2006 edition), it was responsible for 431 killings.

Of those killed by the UDA/UFF:
* 209 (~80%) were civilians, 12 of whom were civilian political activists
* 11 (~4%) were members or former members of republican paramilitary groups
* 37 (~14%) were members or former members of loyalist paramilitary groups
* 3 (~1%) were members of the British security forces

The CAIN database says there were 91 UDA members and four former members killed in the conflict.

<text>Sporadic [[feud]]s erupted almost routinely between Northern Ireland&#x27;s various [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitary groups after the ethno-political conflict known as the Troubles began in 1969. The feuds have frequently involved conflicts between and within the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) as well as, later, the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF).

==UDA–UVF feuds==
Although the UDA and UVF have frequently co-operated and generally co-existed, the two groups have clashed. Two particular feuds stood out for their bloody nature.

===1974–1975===
A feud in the winter of 1974-75 broke out between the UDA and the UVF, the two main loyalist paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland. The bad blood originated from an incident in the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike of May 1974 when the two groups were co-operating in support of the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council. That support the UDA and UVF members were giving involved shutting down their own social clubs and pubs due to complaints from loyalist wives of the striking men. The reason for this was with the men not working and funds being tight, the wives saw what little money they did have being spent at the pubs and social clubs controlled by UDA/UVF; therefore, the wives put pressure on the leaders of both groups to shut them down for the duration of the strike, and after consultation they agreed. All shut down except for a lone UVF-affiliated pub on the Shankill Road. On a November night in 1974, a UVF man named Joe Shaw visited the pub for a drink. While there, he was &quot;ribbed by the regulars about having allowed his local to be closed&quot;. A few pints later Shaw and some friends returned to their local, on North Queen St., and opened it up. UDA men patrolling the area had seen the pubs lights on and ordered Shaw and his friends to close the place down and go home. Shaw refused, and the UDA men left, but they returned a short while later with a shotgun, determined to close the pub down. In the brawl that developed Shaw was fatally wounded. A joint statement described it as a tragic accident, although a subsequent UVF inquiry put the blame on Stephen Goatley and John Fulton, both UDA men. With antagonism growing, another man was killed in a drunken brawl on 21 February 1975, this time the UDA&#x27;s Robert Thompson. This was followed by another pub fight in North Belfast in March and this time the UVF members returned armed and shot and killed both Goatley and Fulton, who had been involved in the earlier fight.

The following month, UDA Colonel Hugh McVeigh and his aide David Douglas were the next to die, kidnapped by the UVF on the Shankill Road and taken to Carrickfergus where they were beaten before being killed near Islandmagee. The UDA initially believed the IRA were responsible and intended to kidnap twenty Catholics in retaliation. The UDA&#x27;s leadership were persuaded to call off their plan by a Protestant clergyman, who convinced them that the IRA were not involved. After Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume revealed he had been informed of the aborted attacks, UDA chairman Andy Tyrie conceded that had been the UDA&#x27;s intention but denied the group had planned shoot one hostage a day until the two missing UDA men were released.

The UDA retaliated in East Belfast by attempting to kill UVF leader Ken Gibson, who in turn ordered the UDA&#x27;s headquarters in the east of the city to be blown up, although this attack also failed. The feud rumbled on for several months in 1976 with a number of people, mostly UDA members, being killed before eventually the two groups came to an uneasy truce.

===2000===
Although the two organisations had worked together under the umbrella of the Combined Loyalist Military Command, the body crumbled in 1997 and tensions simmered between West Belfast UDA Brigadier Johnny Adair, who had grown weary of the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, and the UVF leadership. Adair by this time had forged close links with the dissident LVF, a breakaway group to which the UVF was ardently opposed. Amidst an atmosphere of increasing tension in the area, Adair decided to host a &quot;Loyalist Day of Culture&quot; on the Shankill on Saturday 19 August 2000, which saw thousands of UDA members from across Northern Ireland descend on his Lower Shankill stronghold, where a series of newly commissioned murals were officially unveiled on a day which also featured a huge UDA/UFF parade and armed UDA/UFF show of strength. The UVF leadership had sought and been given assurances that no LVF regalia would be displayed on the Shankill on the day of the procession. However, and unknown to the UDA beyond its &quot;C Company&quot;, Adair had an LVF flag delivered to the Lower Shankill on the morning of the celebrations. He planned to have it unfurled as the procession passed the Rex Bar, a UVF haunt, in order to antagonise the UVF and try and drag it into conflict with as much of the UDA as possible. Adair waited until the bulk of the parade of UDA men had made its way up into the heart of the Shankill before initiating the provocative gesture. Violence broke out between UVF men who had been standing outside the Rex watching the procession and the group involved in unfurling the contentious flag, which had been discreetly concealed near the tail end of the parade. Prior to this the atmosphere at the Rex had been jovial, with the UVF spectators even joining in to sing UDA songs along to the tunes of the UDA-aligned flute bands which accompanied the approximately ten thousand UDA men on their parade up the Shankill Road. But vicious fighting ensued, with a roughly three hundred-strong C Company (the name given to the Lower Shankill unit of the UDA&#x27;s West Belfast Brigade, which contained Adair&#x27;s most loyal men) mob attacking the patrons of the Rex, initially with hand weapons such as bats and iron bars, before they shot up the bar as its patrons barricaded themselves inside. Also shot up was the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) headquarters which faced the pub. C Company then went on the rampage in the Lower Shankill, attacking the houses of known UVF members and their families, including the home of veteran UVF leader Gusty Spence, and evicting the inhabitants at gunpoint as they wrecked and stole property and set fire to homes. By the end of the day nearly all those with UVF associations had been driven from the Lower Shankill. Later that night, C Company gunmen shot up the Rex again, this time from a passing car. While most of the UDA guests at Adair&#x27;s carnival had duly left for home when it became apparent that he was using it to engineer violent conflict with the UVF, festivities nonetheless continued late into the night on the Lower Shankill, where Adair hosted an open air rave party and fireworks display.

The UVF struck back on Monday morning, shooting dead two Adair associates, Jackie Coulter and Bobby Mahood, as they sat in a Range Rover on the Crumlin Road. The UVF also shot up the Ulster Democratic Party headquarters on the Middle Shankill. An hour later Adair&#x27;s unit burned down the PUP&#x27;s offices close to Agnes Street, the de facto border between the UVF-dominated Middle and Upper Shankill and the UDA-dominated Lower Shankill. The UVF responded by blowing up the UDP headquarters on the Middle Shankill. Adair was returned to prison by the Secretary of State on 14 September, although the feud continued with four more killed before the end of the year. Violence also spread to North Belfast, where members of the UVF&#x27;s Mount Vernon unit shot and killed a UDA member, David Greer, in the Tiger&#x27;s Bay area, sparking a series of killings in that part of the city. In another incident the County Londonderry town of Coleraine saw tumult in the form of an attempted expulsion of UVF members by UDA members, which was successfully resisted by the UVF. But, aside from these exceptions, Adair&#x27;s attempt to ignite a full-scale war between the two organisations failed, as both the UVF and UDA leaderships moved decisively to contain the trouble within the Shankill area, where hundreds of families had been displaced, and focused on dealing with its source as well as its containment. To Adair&#x27;s indignation even the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; Companies of his West Belfast Brigade of the UDA declined to get involved in C Company&#x27;s war with the UVF. Eventually a ceasefire was reluctantly agreed upon by the majority of those involved in the feuding after new procedures were established with the aim of preventing the escalation of any future problems between the two organisations, and after consideration was paid to the advice of Gary McMichael and David Ervine, the then leaders of the two political wings of loyalism.

==UVF–LVF feuds==
The LVF was founded by Billy Wright when he, along with the Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade, was stood down by the UVF leadership on 2 August 1996 for breaking the ceasefire. This origin underscored frequent battles between the two movements. Matters had come to a head when Wright&#x27;s unit killed a Catholic taxi-driver during the Drumcree standoff. Although Wright had been expelled from the UVF, threatened with execution and an order to leave Northern Ireland, which he defied, the feud was largely contained during his life and the two major eruptions came after his death.

===1999–2001===
Simmering tensions boiled over in a December 1999 incident involving LVF members and UVF Mid-Ulster brigadier Richard Jameson and his men at the Portadown F.C. social club in which the LVF supporters were severely beaten. The LVF members swore revenge and on 10 January 2000 they took it by shooting Jameson dead on the outskirts of Portadown. The UVF retaliated by murdering two Protestant teenagers in Tandragee, who were both suspected of LVF membership and involvement in Jameson&#x27;s death. As it turned out, the victims, Andrew Robb and David McIlwaine, were not part of any loyalist paramilitary organisation. The UDA&#x27;s Johnny Adair supported the LVF and used the feud to stoke up the troubles that eventually flared in his feud with the UVF later that year. Meanwhile, the UVF attempted to kill the hitman responsible for killing Jameson, unsuccessfully, before the LVF struck again on 26 May, killing PUP man Martin Taylor in Ballysillan. The LVF then linked up with Johnny Adair&#x27;s C Company for a time as their feud with the UVF took centre stage.

However, the UVF saw fit to continue the battle in 2001, using its satellite group the Red Hand Commando to kill two of the LVF&#x27;s leading figures, Adrian Porter and Stephen Warnock. Adair, however, convinced the LVF that the latter killing was the work of one of his rivals in the UDA, Jim Gray, who the LVF then unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate.

===2005===
In July 2005 the feud came to a conclusion as the UVF made a final move against its rival organisation. The resulting activity led to the deaths of at least four people, all associated with the LVF. As a result of these attacks on 30 October 2005 the LVF announced that its units had been ordered to cease their activity and that it was disbanding. In February 2006, the Independent Monitoring Commission reported that this feud had come to an end.

==UDA internal feuds==
The UDA, the largest of the loyalist paramilitary groups, has seen a number of internal struggles within its history.

===1972–1974===
From its beginnings the UDA was wracked by internal problems and in 1972, the movement&#x27;s first full year of existence, three members, Ingram Beckett, John Brown and Ernest Elliott were killed by other UDA members. The main problems were between East Belfast chief Tommy Herron and Charles Harding Smith, his rival in the west of the city, over who controlled the movement. Although they had agreed to make compromise candidate Andy Tyrie the leader, each man considered himself the true leader. Herron was killed in September 1973 in an attack that remains unsolved.

However, with Tyrie confirmed in overall control of the UDA, Harding Smith initially remained silent until, in 1974, he declared that the West Belfast brigade of the movement was splitting from the mainstream UDA on the pretext of a visit to Libya organised by Tyrie in a failed attempt to procure arms from Colonel Qadaffi. The trip had been roundly criticised by the Unionist establishment and raised cries that the UDA was adopting socialism, and so Harding Smith used it re-ignite his attempts to take charge. Harding Smith survived two separate shootings but crucially lost the support of other leading Shankill Road UDA figures and eventually left Belfast after being visited by North Belfast Brigadier Davy Payne, who warned him that he would not survive a third attack.

===1987–1989===
South Belfast Brigadier John McMichael was killed by the Provisional IRA in December 1987 but it was later admitted that UDA member James Pratt Craig, a rival of McMichael&#x27;s within the movement, had played a role in planning the murder. A new generation of leaders emerged at this time and decided that the woes facing the UDA, including a lack of arms and perceived poor leadership by ageing brigadiers, were being caused by the continuing leadership of Andy Tyrie.

Tyrie was forced to resign in March 1988 and the new men, most of whom had been trained up by McMichael, turned on some of the veterans whom Tyrie had protected. Craig was killed, Tommy Lyttle was declared persona non grata and various brigadiers were removed from office, with the likes of Jackie McDonald, Joe English and Jim Gray taking their places.

===2002–2003===
A second internal feud arose in 2002 when Johnny Adair and former politician John White were expelled from the UDA. Many members of the 2nd Battalion Shankill Road West Belfast Brigade, commonly known as &#x27;C&#x27; Company, stood by Adair and White, while the rest of the organisation were involved with attacks on these groups and vice versa. There were four murders; the first victim being a nephew of a leading loyalist opposed to Adair, Jonathon Stewart, killed at a party on 26 December 2002. Roy Green was killed in retaliation. The last victims were John &#x27;Grug&#x27; Gregg (noted for a failed attempt on the life of Gerry Adams) and Robert Carson, another Loyalist. Adair&#x27;s time as leader came to an end on 6 February 2003 when south Belfast brigadier Jackie McDonald led a force of around 100 men onto the Shankill to oust Adair, who promptly fled to England. Adair&#x27;s former ally Mo Courtney, who had returned to the mainstream UDA immediately before the attack, was appointed the new West Belfast brigadier, ending the feud.

Shortly after the removal of Jimbo Simpson in 2003 a number of incidents where several houses and a business were attacked in the Ballysillan and Glenbryn areas. It is understood a mob of up to 40 of Simpson&#x27;s supporters attempted to oust the current leadership. Jim &#x27;Jimbo&#x27; Simpson - dubbed the &#x27;Bacardi Brigadier&#x27; when he was the organisation&#x27;s north Belfast leader - was believed to have fled Northern Ireland with several supporters shortly after the failed coup.

===2006: Shoukris Expulsion from UDA===
The other five brigadiers in the UDA leadership decided to expel Andre Shoukri, his brother Ihab, and another associate in June 2006. Bloodshed was averted after a leading member of a breakaway faction left NI and others faced arrest 

===2013–date: North Belfast Brigade feud===
In 2013 it was reported in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; that the UDA West Belfast Brigade had become so associated with criminality and racketeering that the three other Belfast-based brigadiers, Jackie McDonald (South Belfast), Jimmy Birch (East Belfast) and John Bunting (North Belfast), no longer felt able to deal with the western leadership. Tensions had been further stoked by a graffiti campaign against Bunting&#x27;s leadership on the York Road, in which expelled members of the North Belfast Brigade, who had come under the wing of their counterparts in the west, called for Bunting&#x27;s removal as brigadier. The feud was confirmed in December 2013 when a UDA statement was released acknowledging the existence of a dissident tendency within the North Belfast Brigade but confirming support for Bunting&#x27;s leadership. However, whilst the statement was signed by McDonald and Birch, no representative of the West Belfast Brigade had added their signature. The north Belfast rebels subsequently named Robert Molyneaux, a convicted killer and former friend of Bunting&#x27;s closest ally John Howcroft, as their preferred choice for Brigadier. Bunting&#x27;s opponents criticised his alleged heavy-handed approach, particularly towards Tiger&#x27;s Bay residents, whilst his supporters claimed that Bunting&#x27;s attempts to tackle the drugs trade in the area were the real reason behind the attempts to remove him.

As the feud rumbled on Bunting became a target for a number of attacks. In May 2014 Bunting was attacked in Tiger&#x27;s Bay by a group of opponents. During the brawl Bunting was knocked unconscious and had his mobile phone stolen. Bunting had been visiting the home of one of his internal critics at the time of the incident. In August 2014 as Bunting drove along Duncairn Gardens, a street separating Tiger&#x27;s Bay from the republican New Lodge area his car was damaged by a pipe bomb thrown at it. Tiger&#x27;s Bay had emerged as the stronghold of the anti-Bunting faction.

Soon after the latter attack former North Belfast brigadier William Borland, who had become associated with the pro-Molyneaux wing, was attacked with a breeze block and shot in the leg close to his home in Carr&#x27;s Glen. Following the attack both Bunting and Howcroft were arrested on suspicion of involvement. Along with another associate they were charged with attempting to murder Borland and Andre Shoukri and were remanded in custody. As is standard within the UDA whilst in custody Bunting had to relinquish his role as brigadier although his replacement, a close friend of McDonald&#x27;s from Taughmonagh in south Belfast identified only as the &quot;Burger King Brigadier&quot; due to his weight, has been reported as merely a figurehead with no actual power. Subsequent reports indicated this brigadier had lasted only two weeks before McDonald replaced him with an unidentified former member of the Loyalist Volunteer Force.

In September 2014 it was reported in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; that the leaders of the UDA in North, East and South Belfast, as well as the head of the Londonderry and North Antrim Brigade had met to discuss the feud as well as the schism with the West Belfast Brigade. According to the report they agreed that West Belfast Brigade members loyal to the wider UDA should establish a new command structure for the brigade which would then take the lead in ousting Mo Courtney, Jim Spence and Eric McKee from their existing leadership positions. It was also stated that the West Belfast breakaway leaders had recruited Jimbo Simpson, a former North Belfast brigadier driven out of Northern Ireland over a decade earlier, and were seeking to restore him to his former role. This followed the rejection of earlier overtures to West Belfast brigadier Matt Kincaid as he opted to back Spence and Courtney.

The charges against Bunting were dropped in 2015 after a number of witnesses withdrew their statements, although Bunting did not return as brigadier, his place having been taken by &quot;Big&quot; Bill Hill, a dissident who had been prominent in the Belfast City Hall flag protests. However this new leadership also began a feud with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) group in Mount Vernon, a move which was not endorsed by their previous allies in West Belfast. In August 2016 the new leader was reported as having fled to Scotland due to the threat of the Mount Vernon UVF. John Boreland was shot dead soon after this.

In October 2016 it was reported that South Belfast brigadier Jackie McDonald had installed Sam &quot;Bib&quot; Blair, a White City-based veteran who had been kneecapped by supporters of the Shoukris in 2003 after attempting to oust them from the leadership, as the new brigadier. Blair attempted to shore up his position by recruiting former allies of Bunting to his side, having reportedly been only sixth choice for the role with several more prominent figures turning down the job as a &quot;poisoned chalice&quot;. However, by June 2017 it was reported that the UDA in North Belfast had disintegrated into three sections: Blair&#x27;s supporters, a group of dissidents in Tiger&#x27;s Bay and a further group in Boreland&#x27;s former stronghold of Ballysillan.

===2017–date: South East Antrim Brigade feud===
On 13 March 2017 George Gilmore, formerly a commander in the brigade was the target of an assassination for standing up for friends and family who were being bullied by the leadership in Carrickfergus. Gilmore died the following day, with the incident described as part of an ongoing feud in the town. Two men were subsequently charged with the murder. Gilmore had been targeted in an unsuccessful crossbow attack the previous August. The South-east Antrim brigadier, who was not named in reports, stated that any brigade members attending Gilmore&#x27;s funeral would be expelled.

On 29 May 2017 the South East Antrim UDA murdered an ex member and friend of George Gilmore. Colin Horner was fatally shot in front of his three-year-old son at a busy shopping centre. Police have made various arrests. 

==UVF internal feuds==
The feud between the UVF and the LVF began as an internal feud but quickly changed when Billy Wright established the LVF as a separate organisation. Beyond this the UVF has largely avoided violent internal strife, with only two killings that can be described as being part of an internal feud taking place on Belfast&#x27;s Shankill Road in late November 1975, with Archibald Waller and Noel Shaw being the two men killed. Several months prior to these killings, Mid-Ulster Brigadier Billy Hanna was shot dead outside his Lurgan home on 27 July 1975, allegedly by his successor, Robin Jackson. This killing, however, was not part of a feud but instead carried out as a form of internal discipline from within the Mid-Ulster Brigade.

<doc id="180028" wikidata="Q84069440" url="?curid=180028" title="Coat of arms of New York">
<text>The coat of arms of the state of New York was formally adopted in 1778, and appears as a component of the state&#x27;s flag and seal.

The shield displays a masted ship and a sloop on the Hudson River (symbols of inland and foreign commerce), bordered by a grassy shore and a mountain range in the background with the smiling sun rising behind it. The unheraldic nature of the Hudson River landscape reveals the modern origin of the design.

The shield has two supporters:

* Left: Liberty, with the Revolutionary imagery of a Phrygian cap raised on a pole. Her left foot treads upon a crown that represents freedom from the British monarchy that once ruled what is now New York as a colony.
* Right: Justice, wearing a blindfold (representing impartiality) and holding scales (representing fairness) and the sword of justice.

A banner below the shield shows the motto &quot;&quot;, a Latin word meaning &quot;higher&quot;, &quot;superior&quot;, &quot;lordly&quot;, commonly translated as &quot;Ever Upward.&quot; Following the adoption of the 2021 State Budget in April 2020, a secondary motto, &quot;E pluribus unum,&quot; appears.

Flags bearing the pre-2020 coat of arms (i.e. without the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;) are still widely used so long as serviceable.

The shield is surmounted by a crest consisting of an eagle surmounting a world globe.

The flag of New York is the coat of arms on a solid blue background and the state seal of New York is the coat of arms surrounded by the words &quot;The Great Seal of the State of New York.&quot; It is one of nine U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wyoming.

==Blazon==
The official blazon for the coat of arms is:

::&quot;Charge. Azure, in a landscape, the sun in fess, rising in splendor or, behind a range of three mountains, the middle one the highest; in base a ship and sloop under sail, passing and about to meet on a river, bordered below by a grassy shore fringed with shrubs, all proper.&quot;

::&quot;Crest. On a wreath azure and or, an American eagle proper, rising to the Dexter from a two-thirds of a globe terrestrial, showing the north Atlantic ocean with outlines of its shores.&quot;

::&quot;Supporters. On a quasi compartment formed by the extension of the scroll.

::&quot;Dexter. The figure of Liberty proper, her hair disheveled and decorated with pearls, vested azure, sandaled gules, about the waist a cincture or, fringed gules, a mantle of the last depending from the shoulders behind to the feet, in the dexter hand a staff ensigned with a Phrygian cap or, the sinister arm embowed, the hand supporting the shield at the dexter chief point, a royal crown by her sinister foot dejected.&quot;

::&quot;Sinister. The figure of Justice proper, her hair disheveled and decorated with pearls, vested or, about the waist a cincture azure, fringed gules, sandaled and mantled as Liberty, bound about the eyes with a fillet proper, in the dexter hand a straight sword hilted or, erect, resting on the sinister chief point of the shield, the sinister arm embowed, holding before her scales proper.&quot;

::&quot;Motto. On a scroll below the shield argent, in sable, two lines. On line one, Excelsior and on line two, E pluribus unum.&quot;

==Interpretation==
According to Joseph Gavit in New York History, Volume XXXI, the seal symbolizes the following:

* In the center, a shield reveals the sun rising behind Mount Beacon over the Hudson River. &quot;The shield symbolizes in the full sun the name and idea of Old York and the old world; the mountains, river and meadow, with the ships, convey the name and idea of New York in the new world.&quot;
* To the right, Justice is ready to fight tyranny with her sword held high.
* Liberty, on the left, holds her foot on the overthrown English crown. &quot;This New York is supported by Justice and Liberty, and discards monarchy.&quot;
* The world globe is displayed above the shield. &quot;By exhibiting the eastern and western continents on the globe, the old and new are brought together;&quot;
* Above the world globe soars the eagle. &quot;while the eagle on the crest proclaims,&quot; Westward the course of empire takes its way.&quot;
* The bottom ribbon exclaims &quot;Excelsior&quot;, which means &quot;still higher&quot; or &quot;ever upward&quot;.

==History==

The first version of the coat of arms on the state flag was adopted in 1778 and has been slightly redesigned over the years. The present flag itself is a contemporary variant of an American Revolutionary War-era flag. The original is at the Albany Institute of History &amp; Art. 

The flag was not well defined at first, but variations of a flag with the state&#x27;s coat of arms have existed since 1777. In 1858 the Adjutant General&#x27;s office issued that the state flag features the state&#x27;s coat of arms over a white background. On March 16, 1888 Mayor Hewitt of New York City ordered that the state flag should fly over City Hall on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. The flag was formally adopted by the state legislature in 1896 featuring a buff background since George Washington mandated regiments from New York and New Jersey wear buff facings. However, this choice of color for the flag proved unpopular in New York as it was the custom for military flags to be blue with the coat of arms, as they had been for New York troops during and before the Civil War. The legislature changed the field of the flag from buff to blue by a law enacted on April 2, 1901.

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags. After the survey was completed, NAVA members chose the flag of New York to be ranked 53rd out of the 72.

In April 2020, the 2021 state budget was passed, modifying the coat of arms to include &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; as a secondary motto beneath &quot;Excelsior&quot;. The state seal and flag were also updated as well to reflect the change.

<doc id="180029" wikidata="Q60674392" url="?curid=180029" title="List of non-standard dates">
<text>Several non-standard dates are used in calendars for various purposes: some are expressly fictional, some are intended to produce a rhetorical effect (such as sarcasm), and others attempt to address a particular mathematical, scientific or accounting requirement or discrepancy within the calendar system.

==Historical==
===January 0===
January 0 or 0 January is an alternative name for December 31. January 0 is the day before January 1 in an annual ephemeris. It keeps the date in the year for which the ephemeris was published, thus avoiding any reference to the previous year, even though it is the same day as December 31 of the previous year. January 0 also occurs in the epoch for the ephemeris second, &quot;1900 January 0 at 12 hours ephemeris time&quot;. 1900 January 0 (at Greenwich Mean Noon) was also the epoch used by Newcomb&#x27;s &quot;Tables of the Sun&quot;, which became the epoch for the Dublin Julian day.

===February 30===

February 30 or 30 February is a date that does not occur on the Gregorian calendar, where the month of February contains only 28 days, or 29 days in a leap year. However, from a historical perspective February 30 has been used at least once and appears in some reform calendars.

The thirteenth-century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco claimed that in the Julian calendar, February had 30 days in leap years from 45 BC until 8 BC, when Augustus allegedly shortened February by one day to give that day to the month of August named after him so that it had the same length as the month of July named after his adoptive father, Julius Caesar. However, all historical evidence refutes Sacrobosco, including dual dates with the Alexandrian calendar.

February 30 was a day that happened in Sweden, 1712. This occurred because, instead of changing from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar by omitting a block of consecutive days, as had been done in other countries, the Swedish Empire planned to change gradually by omitting all leap days from 1700 to 1740, inclusive. Although the leap day was omitted in February 1700, the Great Northern War began later that year, diverting the attention of the Swedes from their calendar so that they did not omit leap days on the next two occasions; 1704 and 1708 remained leap years.

To avoid confusion and further mistakes, the Julian calendar was restored in 1712 by adding an extra leap day, thus giving that year the only known actual use of February 30 in a calendar. That day corresponded to February 29 in the Julian calendar and to March 11 in the Gregorian calendar. The Swedish conversion to the Gregorian calendar was finally accomplished in 1753, when February 17 was followed by March 1.

Artificial calendars may also have 30 days in February. For example, in a climate model the statistics may be simplified by having 12 months of 30 days. The Hadley Centre General Circulation Model is an example.

===February 31===
February 31 or 31 February is exceptionally used on gravestones when the date is unknown, or, in at least one case, out of supposed superstition (more likely an error).

===May 35===
May 35 or 35 May is used in mainland China to avoid censorship when referring to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, where the official names are strictly censored by the national government, and the event is normally referred to as June 4. It is also used in the title of &quot;The 35th of May, or Conrad&#x27;s Ride to the South Seas&quot;, a German children&#x27;s novel published in 1931.

=== July 36 ===

July 36 refers to 5 August 2024, when the Bangladesh quota reform movement celebrated Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigning and fleeing to India after mass protests, which began with the reinstatement of the quota system in June and escalated despite the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling on 21 July in favor of quota reform.

===December 31.5 GMT===

December 31.5 GMT in 1924 almanacs was an instant defined to resolve the contrast between two different conventions in defining the civil time of referring to midnight as zero hours.

=== December 32, 1980 ===
The LearAvia Lear Fan aircraft test flight had British government &quot;funding that expired at the end of that year.&quot; After the cancellation of a planned test flight on December 31, 1980, due to technical issues, the first prototype made its maiden flight on January 1, 1981, but a sympathetic government official recorded the date as &quot;December 32, 1980&quot;.

==Software==
Microsoft Excel displays the day before January 1, 1900 (the earliest date it can represent) as January 0, 1900. It also treats 1900 incorrectly as a leap year (whereas only centuries divisible by 400 are), so it displays the day before March 1, 1900, as the non-existent February 29 instead of February 28. This means March 1, 1900 is the earliest date that can be used reliably in Excel.

February 31 is used (along with February 32 and February 33) for calculating weather data.

Other non-standard dates are sometimes used in software engineering. For example, Java (specifically the java.util.Calendar class) allows dates such as February 0 (= January 31) and April 31 (= May 1).

==Other uses==
March 0 is used in astronomy. 

==Fictional calendars==
In the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, the Hobbits have developed the Shire Reckoning. According to Appendix D of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, this calendar has arranged the year in 12 months of 30 days each. The month the Hobbits call &quot;Solmath&quot; is rendered in the text as &quot;February&quot;, and therefore the date February 30 exists in the narrative.

February 30, 1951, is the last night of the world in Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story &quot;Last Night of the World&quot;.

&quot;June 31&quot; is a fictional date in the Soviet film &quot;31 June&quot;. It is also the date of a fictional RAF raid on Germany in Len Deighton&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Bomber&quot;.

&quot;December 32&quot; or &quot;32 December&quot; is the date of Hogswatchnight in &quot;Hogfather&quot; by Terry Pratchett. It has also been used as a title for various works.

The children&#x27;s book &quot;Please Try to Remember the First of Octember!&quot; by Dr. Seuss narrates many delightful things which are supposed to happen starting on the first day of the fictional month of Octember.

==In popular culture==

March 0 is used in Doomsday algorithm calculations. March 2 was celebrated as February 30 by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Weird Al Yankovic for the release date of Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;The &quot;Hamilton&quot; Polka&quot;.

In November 2010 it was discovered that a Hanshin Tigers wall calendar incorrectly included the date &quot;November 31&quot;. Fans who had bought the calendar were given a sticker to cover up the date, and reprinted calendars were sent.

In the episode &quot;94 Meetings&quot; of the sitcom Parks and Recreation, Ron Swanson is forced to deal with 94 meetings in a single day because his assistant, April, scheduled them all for March 31st (instead of the common fake date of February 31), mistakenly believing it was not a real date.

Soul band Black Pumas included a song named &quot;OCT 33&quot; on their Grammy-nominated 2019 eponymous album.

The 1998 French-language film August 32nd on Earth was written and directed by Denis Villeneuve, and was his feature film directoral debut.

==Reform calendars==
Because evening out the lengths of the months is part of the rationale for reforming the calendar, some reform calendars, such as the World Calendar and the Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar, contain a 30-day February. The Symmetry454 calendar assigns 35 days to February, May, August, and November, as well as December in a leap year.

<doc id="180030" wikidata="Q862085" url="?curid=180030" title="Melting pot">
<text>A melting pot is a monocultural metaphor for a society becoming more , the different elements &quot;melting together&quot; with a common culture; an alternative being a homogeneous society becoming more heterogeneous through the influx of foreign elements with different cultural backgrounds. It can also create a harmonious hybridized society known as cultural amalgamation. In the United States, the term is often used to describe the cultural integration of immigrants to the country. A related concept has been defined as &quot;cultural additivity.&quot;

The melting-together metaphor was in use by the 1780s. The exact term &quot;melting pot&quot; came into general usage in the United States after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion or mixture of nationalities, cultures and ethnicities in Israel Zangwill&#x27;s 1908 play of the same name.

The desirability of assimilation and the melting pot model has been rejected by proponents of multiculturalism, who have suggested alternative metaphors to describe the current American society, such as a salad bowl, or kaleidoscope, in which different cultures mix, but remain distinct in some aspects. The melting pot continues to be used as an assimilation model in vernacular and political discourse along with more inclusive models of assimilation in the academic debates on identity, adaptation and integration of immigrants into various political, social and economic spheres.

==Use of the term==
The concept of immigrants &quot;melting&quot; into the receiving culture is found in the writings of J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur. In his &quot;Letters from an American Farmer&quot; (1782) Crèvecœur writes, in response to his own question, &quot;What then is the American, this new man?&quot; that the American is one who &quot;leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the government he obeys, and the new rank he holds. He becomes an American by being received in the broad lap of our great Alma Mater. Here individuals of all nations are &quot;melted&quot; into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world.&quot;

In 1845, Ralph Waldo Emerson, alluding to the development of European civilization out of the medieval Dark Ages, wrote in his private journal of America as the Utopian product of a culturally and racially mixed &quot;smelting pot&quot;, but only in 1912 were his remarks first published.

A magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly:

In 1893, historian Frederick Jackson Turner also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one American culture. In his essay &quot;The Significance of the Frontier in American History&quot;, he referred to the &quot;composite nationality&quot; of the American people, arguing that the frontier had functioned as a &quot;crucible&quot; where &quot;the immigrants were Americanized, liberated and fused into a mixed race, English in neither nationality nor characteristics&quot;.

In his 1905 travel narrative &quot;The American Scene&quot;, Henry James discusses cultural intermixing in New York City as a &quot;fusion, as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot&quot;.

==United States==

=== Melting pot &quot;methods&quot; ===

There were a number of ways that the melting pot is considered to have worked throughout American history. For example, baseball, whose unifying powers were first perceived in the aftermath of the 1860s Civil War, was often said to play a significant role in integrating immigrants in particular. In New York City, where the modern version of baseball began, immigrants invented variations of the game in the streets at the turn of the 20th century in their rush to integrate themselves. Baseball also improved race relations: Jackie Robinson was a major black baseball-playing icon who crossed Major League Baseball&#x27;s color line by 1947, which helped to reduce racial segregation.

===Multiracial influences on culture===
White Americans long regarded some elements of African-American culture quintessentially &quot;American&quot;, while at the same time treating African Americans as second-class citizens. White appropriation, stereotyping and mimicking of black culture played an important role in the construction of an urban popular culture in which European immigrants could express themselves as Americans, through such traditions as blackface, minstrel shows and later in jazz and in early Hollywood cinema, notably in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927).

Analyzing the &quot;racial masquerade&quot; that was involved in creation of a white &quot;melting pot&quot; culture through the stereotyping and imitation of black and other non-white cultures in the early 20th century, historian Michael Rogin has commented: &quot;Repudiating 1920s nativism, these films [Rogin discusses &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, &quot;Old San Francisco&quot; (1927), &quot;Whoopee!&quot; (1930), &quot;King of Jazz&quot; (1930) celebrate the melting pot. Unlike other racially stigmatized groups, white immigrants can put on and take off their mask of difference. But the freedom promised immigrants to make themselves over points to the vacancy, the violence, the deception, and the melancholy at the core of American self-fashioning&quot;.

====Ethnicity in films====
This trend towards greater acceptance of ethnic and racial minorities was evident in popular culture in the combat films of World War II, starting with &quot;Bataan&quot; (1943). This film celebrated solidarity and cooperation between Americans of all races and ethnicities through the depiction of a multiracial American unit. At the time blacks and Japanese in the armed forces were still segregated, while Chinese and Indians were in integrated units.

Historian Richard Slotkin sees &quot;Bataan&quot; and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the &quot;melting pot platoon&quot;, a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s &quot;an American community that did not yet exist&quot;, and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation. However, Slotkin points out that ethnic and racial harmony within this platoon is predicated upon racist hatred for the Japanese enemy: &quot;the emotion which enables the platoon to transcend racial prejudice is itself a virulent expression of racial hatred...The final heat which blends the ingredients of the melting pot is rage against an enemy which is fully dehumanized as a race of &#x27;dirty monkeys. He sees this racist rage as an expression of &quot;the unresolved tension between racialism and civic egalitarianism in American life&quot;.

====Olympic Games====
Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City strongly revived the melting pot image, returning to a bedrock form of American nationalism and patriotism. The reemergence of Olympic melting pot discourse was driven especially by the unprecedented success of African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans in events traditionally associated with Europeans and white North Americans such as speed skating and the bobsled. The 2002 Winter Olympics was also a showcase of American religious freedom and cultural tolerance of the history of Utah&#x27;s large majority population of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as representation of Muslim Americans and other religious groups in the U.S. Olympic team.

==Melting pot and cultural pluralism==
In Henry Ford&#x27;s Ford English School (established in 1914), the graduation ceremony for immigrant employees involved symbolically stepping off an immigrant ship and passing through &quot;the melting pot&quot;, entering at one end in costumes designating their nationality and emerging at the other end in identical suits and waving American flags.

In response to the pressure exerted on immigrants to culturally assimilate and also as a reaction against the denigration of the culture of non-Anglo white immigrants by Nativists, intellectuals on the left, such as Horace Kallen in &quot;Democracy Versus the Melting-Pot&quot; (1915), and Randolph Bourne in &quot;Trans-National America&quot; (1916), laid the foundations for the concept of cultural pluralism. This term was coined by Kallen. 

In the United States, where the term melting pot is still commonly used, the ideas of cultural pluralism and multiculturalism have, in some circles, taken precedence over the idea of assimilation. Alternate models where immigrants retain their native cultures such as the &quot;salad bowl&quot; or the &quot;symphony&quot; are more often used by sociologists to describe how cultures and ethnicities mix in the United States. Mayor David Dinkins, when referring to New York City, described it as &quot;not a melting pot, but a gorgeous mosaic...of race and religious faith, of national origin and sexual orientation – of individuals whose families arrived yesterday and generations ago...&quot; 

Since the 1960s, much research in Sociology and History has disregarded the melting pot theory for describing interethnic relations in the United States and other countries. 

Whether to support a melting-pot or multicultural approach has developed into an issue of much debate within some countries. For example, the French and British governments and populace are currently debating whether Islamic cultural practices and dress conflict with their attempts to form culturally unified countries.

==Use in other regions==
=== Religious cultures ===
===Israel===
Today the reaction to this doctrine is ambivalent; some say that it was a necessary measure in the founding years, while others claim that it amounted to cultural oppression. Others argue that the melting pot policy did not achieve its declared target: for example, the persons born in Israel are more similar from an economic point of view to their parents than to the rest of the population.

===Southeast Asia===
The term has been used to describe a number of countries in Southeast Asia. Given the region&#x27;s location and importance to trade routes between China and the Western world, certain countries in the region have become ethnically diverse. In Vietnam, a relevant phenomenon is &quot;&quot; (lit. &quot;Three spears, one point,&quot; idiomatically &quot;three teachers, one lesson&quot;), references the harmonious co-existence and mutually influencing teachings of the nation&#x27;s three major religious schools, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, demonstrating a process described as &quot;cultural addivity&quot;.

In contrast to the melting pot theory, Malaysia and Singapore promote cultural preservation of their various ethnicities. In Malaysia they say &quot;agama, bangsa, negara&quot; which means &quot;various religions, various ethnicities, one nation.&quot; Malaysia is made up of different religions and ethnicities yet all are citizens and everyone should respect one another, join hands, and work together. Each ethnicity should work to preserve their own ethnic identity while at the same time working together to build Malaysia as a national effort, living in peace and harmony.

=== Western Hemisphere ===
==== Caribbean ====

The Caribbean has a substantial amount of mixing between different ethnic groups, due to the history of various labor groups being imported into the region.

==== Latin America ====
Mexico has had a significant amount of cultural and ethnic fusion among its many groups, with its government pursuing a &quot;mestizo&quot; (mixed heritage) ideal. Civil rights reformers in the United States took inspiration from these ideas.

<doc id="180045" wikidata="Q2805539" url="?curid=180045" title="Journey into Space">
<text>Journey Into Space is a BBC Radio science fiction programme written by BBC producer Charles Chilton. It was the last UK radio programme to attract a bigger evening audience than television. Originally, four series were produced (the fourth was a remake of the first), which was translated into 17 languages (including Hindi, Turkish and Dutch) and broadcast in countries worldwide (including Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand and The United States). Chilton later wrote three best-selling novels and several comic strip stories based upon the radio series.

The first series was created in 1953, soon after &quot;Riders of the Range&quot; (a popular Western, also written by Chilton) ended its six series on the BBC Light Programme. Michael Standing, then Head of the BBC Variety Department, asked Chilton if he could write a sci-fi programme, and &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; (later known as &quot;Operation Luna&quot;) was the result. Each half-hour episode would usually end with a dramatic cliffhanger, to increase the audience&#x27;s incentive to tune into the next episode.

The original magnetic recordings of the show were erased shortly after broadcast, and for several decades it was believed that no recordings of the show had survived, although some were broadcast by the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS, formerly AFN) in Europe during the late 1970s. In 1986, a set of misfiled Transcription Service discs (produced for sale to overseas radio stations) was discovered, containing complete copies of the three original series (more accurately, the surviving version of the first series is a cut-down remake of the original, produced for the Transcription Service during the 1950s). This discovery enabled the BBC to begin re-broadcasting the show in the late 1980s, and release copies of the show, first on audio cassette, and more recently on CD and internet download.

Fans of &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; included Colin Pillinger, Kenny Everett, John Major, Stephen Hawking, Miriam Margolyes and former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Philip Hinchcliffe.

== The main characters ==

The four main characters appear in all the original series, as well as the later special episodes:

Guy Kingsley Poynter (who played Doc) had worked with Charles Chilton before &quot;Journey Into Space&quot;, and Chilton once commented that Poynter &quot;was a very good poetry reader&quot;. Chilton also observed that Bruce Beeby was like his character Mitch, and was &quot;always blowing his top&quot;.

David Kossoff asked Chilton if his character (the ship&#x27;s radio operator) could be called Lemuel (a name he loved), and Chilton shortened the name to Lemmy. Chilton based Lemmy&#x27;s character on himself, since he had been a radio operator in the RAF. Originally, Chilton had chosen John Glen to play Jet, but later decided to use Andrew Faulds instead, because Chilton&#x27;s secretary fancied him.

David Jacobs&#x27;s ability to play a wide variety of characters, each with their own distinctive voice, resulted in him playing 22 different characters during the course of &quot;Journey Into Space&quot;. He used to mark up his script using different colour pencils, to help him remember what each character was supposed to sound like. In episode 1 of &quot;The Red Planet&quot;, Jet is interviewed by a group of newspaper reporters, all of whom were played by Jacobs.

Light-hearted pranks were often played on David Jacobs just before a recording session was about to begin. On one occasion, Andrew Faulds poured a jug of water inside his trousers, totally soaking him, and he &quot;did the rest of the programme in a raincoat!&quot; On another occasion, some of the actors smeared mustard on his lip microphone, causing him some difficulties during the recording session.

Don Sharp later became a noted director.

== Original three series ==

=== &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;/&quot;Operation Luna&quot; ===
Initially, the first series was simply known as &quot;Journey Into Space&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;A Tale of the Future&quot; added by the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, but within the BBC it became known as &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;. The series was set in 1965 (the year in which Chilton believed humans would first walk on the Moon), and was first broadcast in 1953–1954 on the BBC Light Programme. The series was originally intended to have 12 episodes (one source claims 8 episodes), and 5.1 million people tuned into the first episode, but the first four episodes (which took place on Earth) did not prove very popular, and the audience soon shrank to fewer than 4 million. But once the rocket set off for the Moon in episode 5, the audience reaction was much more favourable. The series was extended to 18 episodes, and by the time the final episode was broadcast, 8 million people were tuning in.

In 1958, &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; was re-recorded for the BBC Transcription Services (retitled as &quot;Operation Luna&quot;), because the original recordings had been erased. The first four episodes of the original series were omitted, and episodes 12 and 13 were merged into a single episode. Today, the only surviving recording from the original 1953 series &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; is a 5-minute excerpt from the final episode.

Faulds, Kingsley Poynter, and Deryck Guyler were the only actors from &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; to reprise their roles in &quot;Operation Luna&quot;.

In addition to the main characters, other characters in &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; included:
(*) Alan Keith (born Alec Kossoff) was the brother of David Kossoff, who played Lemmy.

Chilton wrote episode 8 of &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; in response to a challenge from a TV producer, who considered the success of the series to be &quot;a fluke&quot;. The producer challenged Chilton to write an episode &quot;that could not be played equally well on television&quot;, and Chilton succeeded – a large proportion of the episode takes place in total darkness. During the episode, Jet reads to the rest of the crew by torchlight from &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot; by H. G. Wells, the only work of fiction carried on board the ship.

Andrew Faulds&#x27;s adopted uncle, Hector MacPherson, was an astronomer, and wrote a book called &quot;Practical Astronomy&quot;. Chilton bought a copy of the book, which first sparked his interest in astronomy, and later led him to write &quot;Journey Into Space&quot;. In episode 7 of &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;, Jet&#x27;s childhood flashback features his great uncle Hector, who was based on Hector MacPherson.

In November 1957, Chilton wrote an episode of the BBC School Radio science series &quot;Our Own and Other Worlds&quot;, titled &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, which featured edited material from episodes 5 and 6 of &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;.

The table below indicates the correspondence between the episodes of &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Operation Luna&quot;.

=== &quot;The Red Planet&quot; ===

The second series, &quot;The Red Planet&quot;, followed the adventures of the crew in their first attempt to reach and explore Mars. Several new characters were introduced, the most notable of which were Frank Rogers and James Edward Whitaker, the two original crewmen of freighter #2. Chilton took the name Whitaker from a copy of &quot;Whitaker&#x27;s Almanack&quot; which was sitting on his desk.

In addition to the main characters, other characters in &quot;The Red Planet&quot; included:

(*) Married to Bruce Beeby, who played Mitch.

The most memorable catchphrase from this series was &quot;Orders must be obeyed without question at all times&quot;, which was often repeated by many of the &#x27;conditioned&#x27; characters, especially Whitaker. Episode 19 of the series rated a 17% audience share, whereas the newsreel broadcast simultaneously on BBC TV had an audience share of 16%. This was the last time that a radio show achieved a higher rating than its TV opponent.

During the first broadcast of this series, the &quot;Radio Times&quot; featured &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; on its cover, showing Andrew Faulds as Captain &quot;Jet&quot; Morgan. His spacesuit (which was used by several of the cast members for publicity photos) was a prototype being developed in Britain at the time.

During the recording of &quot;The Red Planet&quot;, Guy Kingsley Poynter was also starring in &quot;The Teahouse of the August Moon&quot; at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre.

The British Empire Exhibition was referred to throughout the episodes.

In the table of episodes below, the numbers marked with # refer to the numbered freighters of the Mars fleet.

=== &quot;The World in Peril&quot; ===

The third series was a direct continuation of the story begun in &quot;The Red Planet&quot;, and followed Jet Morgan and his crew&#x27;s return to Mars in an attempt to avert the impending Martian invasion.

In addition to the main characters, other characters in &quot;The World in Peril&quot; included:

During the recording of &quot;The World in Peril&quot;, Alfie Bass was also starring in the revue &quot;The Punch Bowl&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre.

== Critical reaction and legacy ==
Public reaction to the show was mixed. Some comments received by the BBC described the show as &quot;a first class affair&quot; and &quot;the best serial for ages&quot;. After episode 5 of &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; was first broadcast, the &quot;Daily Express&quot; commented:

Midway through the original broadcast of &quot;The Red Planet&quot;, a BBC Audience Research Report indicated that the series

However, others commented that the plot often featured scientific inaccuracies, even though Chilton had received technical advice from Flight Lieutenant Roger Burton and Kenneth Gatland of the British Interplanetary Society. One correspondent to the &quot;Radio Times&quot; commented that:

Chilton admitted that he was not a science-fiction writer, astronomer, or scientist, and that his &quot;pursuit of astronomical studies&quot; was &quot;clumsy and very amateurish&quot;. He often &quot;worked very late to deadline&quot;, sometimes not starting to write an episode until two days before recording.

&quot;Journey Into Space&quot; remains popular today, thanks to the discovery of misfiled recordings of the show, which enabled the BBC to begin re-broadcasting the show from the late 1980s onwards.
Philip Hinchcliffe has acknowledged growing up listening to &quot;Journey Into Space&quot;, citing in particular its cliffhangers, as an influence on his period as producer of the science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; between 1974 and 1977.

== Music ==
Van Phillips composed and conducted the music for all three series. The music was initially recorded beforehand, and played from acetate discs during the recording sessions. Later, an eight-piece orchestra was actually present in the studio, and played the music live. Phillips liked the sound of the clavioline, and obtained one for use during &quot;Journey Into Space&quot;. He composed music especially for it, and it was &quot;bolted onto the piano&quot; in the studio. Titles of his compositions include &quot;A Picture of the Universe&quot;, &quot;Rocket Away&quot;, &quot;Music for Outer Space&quot;, &quot;The Red Planet&quot;, &quot;Crossing the Plains&quot;, and &quot;Sunrise&quot;.

In 1955, Decca released a 78rpm record of the &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; theme, performed by Frank Weir and his orchestra (catalogue number F.10435), and sheet music of a piano solo of the theme was also published. In 1978, the recording was included on the 33⅓rpm BBC compilation record &quot;BBC Space Themes&quot; (catalogue number REH 324), and in 2005, Vocalion/Dutton Laboratories included it on their digitally remastered compilation CD &quot;Presenting Frank Weir And His Saxophone&quot; (catalogue number CDLK 4266).

In &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;, Lemmy occasionally provided musical entertainment for the crew on his mouth organ, playing songs such as &quot;Knocked &#x27;em in the Old Kent Road&quot; and &quot;My Old Dutch&quot;. Excerpts of popular music were often used during the episodes, and sometimes played an important role in the plot. In episode 8 of &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;, an excerpt from &quot;Honeymoon on a Rocket Ship&quot; by Hank Snow and The Rainbow Ranch Boys is heard by the crew on the ship&#x27;s radio. &quot;When It&#x27;s Night Time In Italy&quot;, by James Kendis and Lew Brown, was an important part of episodes 7 and 8 of &quot;The Red Planet&quot;. Other popular music used in &quot;The Red Planet&quot; included:
* &quot;Flat Foot Floogie&quot;, by Bulet Galliard, Leroy Stewart, and Bud Green, performed by the Benny Goodman Orchestra
* The theme tune to the &quot;Billy Cotton Band Show&quot;
* &quot;Somebody Stole My Gal&quot;, by Lee Wright
* &quot;Friends and Neighbours&quot;, by Marvin Scott and Malcolm Lockyer
* &quot;Selection of Hebrew Dances Part 2&quot;, by Ambrose and his orchestra
* Banjo music by Billy Bell

&quot;The World in Peril&quot; featured a &#x27;rebel song&#x27;, sung by the &#x27;conditioned&#x27; men aboard the Martian asteroids. This song was actually a musical arrangement of &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot; (a poem taken from Robert Heinlein&#x27;s short story of the same name), performed by the George Mitchell Choir. In the final episode of &quot;The World in Peril&quot;, Chopin Opus 34: No. 2: Valse brillante in A minor is heard playing over the radio.

== Sound effects ==
A variety of sound effects were used in the episodes, and played a major role. In addition to basic sounds, such as feet walking along a corridor or tunnel, more advanced effects were created, such as the mysterious haunting &#x27;music&#x27; which is heard over the rocket&#x27;s radio in many episodes of &quot;Operation Luna&quot;.

The most distinctive effect was the dramatic rocket take-off, which was played at the beginning of each episode, and whenever necessary during the episodes. This was actually a recording of a jet aircraft at Heathrow airport. Often, this would be followed by a slowly ascending tone (representing the rocket accelerating), which &quot;was actually a recording of a thermionic valve played through an echo chamber down at the Physical Research Laboratory at Kingston&quot;. Other sound effects were created at Battersea Power Station, and the sound made by the televiewer on board Luna was actually a naval ASDIC.

The BBC had an echo chamber in the studio, which was greatly utilised during the episodes. Whenever the crew were in contact by radio with Earth control, or another distant location, the echo chamber would be applied to the voice of the remote character. Various sound effects were also created &quot;live&quot; in the studio. For example, in episode 8 of &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot;, the crew hear a mysterious tapping on the outside of the ship; this effect was created &quot;by tapping the needle of the gramophone pickup head, and playing that through an echo chamber&quot;.

The operation of the Martian &quot;Brain&quot; when compiling an answer in response to questions was represented by the sound of a 2000-type Director - a telephone call routing device used in large city Strowger type telephone exchanges.

== Novels ==
Chilton wrote three &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; novels, one for each of the three original series. The first novel, titled &quot;Journey Into Space&quot;, told the story of &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; and was the first book that Chilton had written. It was published in hardback by Herbert Jenkins in 1954, followed by &quot;The Red Planet&quot; in 1956, and &quot;The World in Peril&quot; in 1960. Later they were published in paperback by Pan in 1958, 1960 and 1962 respectively.

On 8 May 2008, BBC Audiobooks released a complete and unabridged audiobook of the first novel, read by William Hope.

== Comic strips ==
In 1956, the &quot;Junior Express&quot; comic began publishing &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; comic strips, with scripts by Charles Chilton and artwork by Italian artist Ferdinando Tacconi. The first adventure, titled &quot;Jet Morgan in Planet of Fear&quot;, was a 35-episode sequel to &quot;The World in Peril&quot;. Tacconi spent some time with Chilton absorbing the atmosphere of the saga, and portrayed (in full colour) the radio actors&#x27; likenesses to match the clever dialogue.

The story was continued in 1957 in the 32-episode adventure, &quot;Shadow over Britain&quot;. In March 1957, Arthur Bruce Cornwell took over from Tacconi as artist, and Chilton lost his enthusiasm for the cartoon strip; thereafter it became a contractual chore for him. Terence Patrick took over from Cornwell in April 1957, and by the time the third adventure began (&quot;The World Next Door&quot;), Chilton was no longer writing the scripts.

The 1956 &quot;Express Weekly&quot; annual contained a short black &amp; white comic strip called &quot;Jet Morgan and the Space Pirates&quot;, illustrated by Tacconi. (&quot;Express Weekly&quot; was the new name of &quot;Junior Express&quot;.) The 1957 annual included a short story called &quot;Jet Morgan and the Space Castaway&quot;, written by Chilton and illustrated by Cornwell.
== Discovery of Transcription discs ==
The programmes were recorded in the studio on 15ips magnetic tape, and were later copied onto 33⅓rpm 16-inch coarse-groove transcription discs for the BBC Transcription Services (except for &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; episodes). The master tapes were erased three months after broadcast, in accordance with BBC policy at the time. The Transcription discs were sold overseas, and their fate was unknown, so for many years it was believed that all the episodes had been lost forever, although a number were broadcast by the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS, formerly AFN) in Europe during the late 1970s.

However, in 1986, a set of misfiled Transcription discs were found by Ted Kendall, a BBC recording engineer, which turned out to be copies of &quot;Operation Luna&quot;, &quot;The Red Planet&quot; and &quot;The World in Peril&quot;. The BBC no longer possessed a suitable turntable on which to play the discs, but Kendall eventually managed to obtain an EMT 927 turntable. To clean the discs, he soaked them in warm water containing Fairy Liquid, brushed them with a goats-hair brush, and dried them using kitchen towels.

Kendall then transferred the recordings to magnetic tape, removing &quot;clicks&quot; from the sound using a device which he designed and built, called the Mousetrap (or Front End). He removed more severe clicks after the transfer, by scraping the oxide off the magnetic tape in appropriate places.

The BBC took the opportunity to re-broadcast all three series on Radio 2, beginning with &quot;Operation Luna&quot; in 1989, followed by &quot;The Red Planet&quot; in 1990 and &quot;The World in Peril&quot; in 1991. Abridged versions of the three series were also released on audio cassette. In 1998, Kendall digitally remastered the recordings for new abridged releases on audio cassette, and in 2004, the unabridged remastered recordings began to be released on CD and internet download. The three series have also been broadcast on BBC Radio 7, now known as BBC Radio 4 Extra.

== Special episodes ==

=== &quot;The Return from Mars&quot; ===
In 1981, Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Theatre&quot; slot ran a special science fiction series, featuring stories such as &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Chrysalids&quot;, &quot;A Fall of Moondust&quot; and &quot;The Technicolor Time Machine&quot;. Charles Chilton was asked to write a new one-off 90-minute episode of &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; for this slot, and &quot;The Return from Mars&quot; was the result. The plot was an approximate continuation from the end of &quot;The World in Peril&quot;. The episode was broadcast on 7 March 1981.

In addition to the main characters, other characters in &quot;The Return from Mars&quot; included:


=== &quot;Frozen in Time&quot; ===
This was a new episode based on the original series, with David Jacobs finally taking the role of Jet Morgan (who has aged while the rest of his crew were in suspended animation owing to a systems malfunction). Charles Chilton wrote the one-hour play which was set in the year 2013. It was broadcast on Radio 4 on Saturday 12 April 2008. This was released by BBC Audio in January 2009.


Music by David Chilton;
producer/director Nicholas Russell-Pavier.

=== &quot;The Host&quot; ===
A further new episode based on the original series by Chilton, written by Julian Simpson starred Toby Stephens as Jet Morgan. Another one-hour play, it was set in the year 2079.
Broadcast as The Saturday Play on Radio 4 on Saturday 27 June 2009.


== BBC releases on audio cassette and CD ==
=== Audiobooks ===
Currently, only the first novel has been released as an audiobook.

==In translation==
A Dutch-language version of the first three series of &quot;Journey into Space&quot; was broadcast in the Netherlands by the (KRO) in 1955–1958 under the title , directed by Léon Povel. Translation was by Eddy Franquinet and the main character roles were played by John de Freese (Jeff Morgan ), Adolf Bouwmeester / Louis de Bree (Doc Matthews), Jan van Ees (Mitch Mitchell), and Jan Borkus (Jimmy Barnett).

Director Léon Povel died just a few days after Charles Chilton, on 8 January 2013, at the age of 101 years. After his death, his youngest son Winfried Povel started recording the fourth series with professional actors and as a special guest the Dutch astronaut André Kuipers. The recording was much longer than the BBC version, at 2 hours 11 minutes, so the play was edited into four episodes (30–36 minutes each) and broadcast as a mini-series. It was broadcast in January 2014 by the KRO-NCRV as well on NPO Radio 5 and repeated the same night on NPO Radio 1.

== Other related series ==
Chilton followed &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; with two other radio series – &quot;Space Force&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Space Force II&quot; in 1985 – which were based on a similar theme. Indeed, &quot;Space Force&quot; had originally been intended as a new &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; serial, following on from &quot;The Return from Mars&quot;, until relatively late in the day, so its four central characters are clear &#x27;doubles&#x27; for the &quot;Journey Into Space&quot; team. In the version that was actually recorded and transmitted, one character (Chipper Barnett) refers to his grandfather Lemmy.

<text>Watercolor (American English) or watercolour (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences), also aquarelle (; from Italian diminutive of Latin &#x27;water&#x27;), is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-based solution. &quot;Watercolor&quot; refers to both the medium and the resulting artwork. Aquarelles painted with water-soluble colored ink instead of modern water colors are called (Latin for &quot;aquarelle made with ink&quot;) by experts. However, this term has now tended to pass out of use.

The conventional and most common support—material to which the paint is applied—for watercolor paintings is watercolor paper. Other supports or substrates include stone, ivory, silk, reed, papyrus, bark papers, plastics, vellum, leather, fabric, wood, and watercolor canvas (coated with a gesso that is specially formulated for use with watercolors). Watercolor paper is often made entirely or partially with cotton. This gives the surface the appropriate texture and minimizes distortion when wet. Watercolor papers are usually cold-pressed papers that provide better texture and appearance. Transparency is the main characteristic of watercolors. &quot;It consists of a mixture of pigments, binders such as gum arabic and humectants such as glycerin, which together with other components, allow the color pigment to join and form the paint paste, which we know as watercolor. With regard to the colors, the quality of the pigments and their degree of concentration, it is what determines how good the watercolor is and also its price. A paint that has a high concentration of pigment, professional type, allows us to use it with a large amount of water without losing the intensity of color.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding Chinese white. This is not a method to be used in &quot;true watercolor&quot; (traditional).

Watercolor paint is an ancient form of painting, if not the most ancient form of art itself. In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush painting or scroll painting. In Chinese, Korean and Japanese painting it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns, often using inkstick or other pigments. India, Ethiopia and other countries have long watercolor painting traditions as well.

Many Western artists, especially in the early 19th century, used watercolor primarily as a sketching tool in preparation for the &quot;finished&quot; work in oil or engraving. Until the end of the eighteenth century, traditional watercolors were known as &#x27;tinted drawings&#x27;.

==History==
Watercolor art dates back to the cave paintings of paleolithic Europe and has been used for manuscript illustration since at least Egyptian times, with particular prominence in the European Middle Ages. However, its &quot;continuous&quot; history as an art medium begins with the Renaissance. The German Northern Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528), who painted several fine botanical, wildlife, and landscape watercolors, is generally considered among the earliest examples of watercolor. An important school of watercolor painting in Germany was led by Hans Bol (1534–1593) as part of the Dürer Renaissance.

Despite this early start, watercolors were generally used by Baroque easel painters only for sketches, copies or cartoons (full-scale design drawings) Notable early practitioners of watercolor painting were Van Dyck (during his stay in England), Claude Lorrain, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, and many Dutch and Flemish artists. However, botanical illustration and wildlife illustration perhaps form the oldest and most important traditions in watercolor painting. Botanical illustrations became popular during the Renaissance, both as hand-tinted woodblock illustrations in books or broadsheets and as tinted ink drawings on vellum or paper. Botanical artists have traditionally been some of the most exacting and accomplished watercolor painters, and even today, watercolors—with their unique ability to summarize, clarify, and idealize in full color—are used to illustrate scientific and museum publications. Wildlife illustration reached its peak in the 19th century with artists such as John James Audubon, and today many naturalist field guides are still illustrated with watercolor paintings.

===English school===
Several factors contributed to the spread of watercolor painting during the 18th century, particularly in England. Among the elite and aristocratic classes, watercolor painting was one of the incidental adornments of a good education; mapmakers, military officers, and engineers valued it for its usefulness in depicting properties, terrain, fortifications, field geology, and for illustrating public works or commissioned projects. Watercolor artists were commonly taken on geological or archaeological expeditions, funded by the Society of Dilettanti (founded in 1733), to document discoveries in the Mediterranean, Asia, and the New World. These expeditions stimulated the demand for topographical painters, who churned out memento paintings of famous sites (and sights) along the Grand Tour to Italy that was undertaken by every fashionable young man of the time.

In the late 18th century, the English cleric William Gilpin wrote a series of hugely popular books describing his picturesque journeys throughout rural England, and illustrated them with self-made sentimentalized monochrome watercolors of river valleys, ancient castles, and abandoned churches. This example popularized watercolors as a form of personal tourist journal. The confluence of these cultural, engineering, scientific, tourist, and amateur interests culminated in the celebration and promotion of watercolor as a distinctly English &quot;national art&quot;. William Blake published several books of hand-tinted engraved poetry, provided illustrations to Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, and he also experimented with large monotype works in watercolor. Among the many other significant watercolorists of this period were Thomas Gainsborough, John Robert Cozens, Francis Towne, Michael Angelo Rooker, William Pars, Thomas Hearne, and John Warwick Smith.
 
From the late 18th century through the 19th century, the market for printed books and domestic art contributed substantially to the growth of the medium. Watercolors were used as the basic document from which collectible landscape or tourist engravings were developed, and hand-painted watercolor originals or copies of famous paintings contributed to many upper class art portfolios. Satirical broadsides by Thomas Rowlandson, many published by Rudolph Ackermann, were also extremely popular.

The three English artists credited with establishing watercolor as an independent, mature painting medium are Paul Sandby (1730–1809), often called the &quot;father of the English watercolor&quot;; Thomas Girtin (1775–1802), who pioneered its use for large format, romantic or picturesque landscape painting; and Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775–1851), who brought watercolor painting to the highest pitch of power and refinement, and created hundreds of superb historical, topographical, architectural, and mythological watercolor paintings. His method of developing the watercolor painting in stages, starting with large, vague color areas established on wet paper, then refining the image through a sequence of washes and glazes, permitted him to produce large numbers of paintings with &quot;workshop efficiency&quot; and made him a multimillionaire, partly by sales from his personal art gallery, the first of its kind. Among the important and highly talented contemporaries of Turner and Girtin were John Varley, John Sell Cotman, Anthony Copley Fielding, Samuel Palmer, William Havell, and Samuel Prout. The Swiss painter Abraham-Louis-Rodolphe Ducros was also widely known for his large format, romantic paintings in watercolor.

The confluence of amateur activity, publishing markets, middle class art collecting, and 19th-century technique led to the formation of English watercolor painting societies: the &quot;Society of Painters in Water Colours&quot; (1804, now known as the Royal Watercolour Society) and the &quot;New Water Colour Society&quot; (1832, now known as the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours). (A &quot;Scottish Society of Painters in Water Colour&quot; was founded in 1878, now known as the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour.) These societies provided annual exhibitions and buyer referrals for many artists. They also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates, particularly between advocates of traditional (&quot;transparent&quot;) watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with body color or gouache (&quot;opaque&quot; watercolor). The late Georgian and Victorian periods produced the zenith of the British watercolor, among the most impressive 19th-century works on paper, due to artists Turner, Varley, Cotman, David Cox, Peter de Wint William Henry Hunt, John Frederick Lewis, Myles Birket Foster, Frederick Walker, Thomas Collier, Arthur Melville and many others. In particular, the graceful, lapidary, and atmospheric watercolors (&quot;genre paintings&quot;) by Richard Parkes Bonington created an international fad for watercolor painting, especially in England and France in the 1820s. In the latter half of the 19th century, portrait painter Frederick Havill became a key player in the establishment of watercolour in England. Art critic Huntly Carter described Havill as a &quot;founder of the water colour school.&quot; 

The popularity of watercolors stimulated many innovations, including heavier and more sized wove papers, and brushes (called &quot;pencils&quot;) manufactured expressly for watercolor. Watercolor tutorials were first published in this period by Varley, Cox, and others, establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today; &quot;The Elements of Drawing&quot;, a watercolor tutorial by English art critic John Ruskin, has been out of print only once since it was first published in 1857. Commercial brands of watercolor were marketed and paints were packaged in metal tubes or as dry cakes that could be &quot;rubbed out&quot; (dissolved) in studio porcelain or used in portable metal paint boxes in the field. Breakthroughs in chemistry made many new pigments available, including synthetic ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, viridian, cobalt violet, cadmium yellow, aureolin (potassium cobaltinitrite), zinc white, and a wide range of carmine and madder lakes. These pigments, in turn, stimulated a greater use of color with all painting media, but in English watercolors, particularly by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

====United States====
Watercolor painting also became popular in the United States during the 19th century; outstanding early practitioners included John James Audubon, as well as early Hudson River School painters such as William H. Bartlett and George Harvey. By mid-century, the influence of John Ruskin led to increasing interest in watercolors, particularly the use of a detailed &quot;Ruskinian&quot; style by such artists as John W. Hill Henry, William Trost Richards, Roderick Newman, and Fidelia Bridges. The &quot;American Society of Painters in Watercolor&quot; (now the American Watercolor Society) was founded in 1866. Late-19th-century American exponents of the medium included Thomas Moran, Thomas Eakins, John LaFarge, John Singer Sargent, Childe Hassam, and, preeminently, Winslow Homer.

===Europe===
Watercolor was less popular in Continental Europe. In the 18th century, gouache was an important medium for the Italian artists Marco Ricci and Francesco Zuccarelli, whose landscape paintings were widely collected. Gouache was used by a number of artists in France as well. In the 19th century, the influence of the English school helped popularize &quot;transparent&quot; watercolor in France, and it became an important medium for Eugène Delacroix, François Marius Granet, Henri-Joseph Harpignies, and the satirist Honoré Daumier. Other European painters who worked frequently in watercolor were Adolph Menzel in Germany and Stanisław Masłowski in Poland.

The adoption of brightly colored, petroleum-derived aniline dyes (and pigments compounded from them), which all fade rapidly on exposure to light, and the efforts to properly conserve the twenty thousand J. M. W. Turner paintings inherited by the British Museum in 1857, led to a negative reevaluation of the permanence of pigments in watercolor. This caused a sharp decline in their status and market value. Nevertheless, isolated practitioners continued to prefer and develop the medium into the 20th century. Paul Signac created landscape and maritime watercolors, and Paul Cézanne developed a watercolor painting style consisting entirely of overlapping small glazes of pure color.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Among the many 20th-century artists who produced important works in watercolor were Wassily Kandinsky, Emil Nolde, Paul Klee, Egon Schiele, and Raoul Dufy. In America, the major exponents included Charles Burchfield, Edward Hopper, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Charles Demuth, and John Marin (80% of his total work is watercolor). In this period, American watercolor painting often emulated European Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, but significant individualism flourished in &quot;regional&quot; styles of watercolor painting from the 1920s to 1940s. In particular, the &quot;Cleveland School&quot; or &quot;Ohio School&quot; of painters centered around the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the California Scene painters were often associated with Hollywood animation studios or the Chouinard Art Institute (now California Institute of the Arts). The California painters exploited their state&#x27;s varied geography, Mediterranean climate, and &quot;automobility&quot; to reinvigorate the outdoor or &quot;plein air&quot; tradition. The most influential among them were Phil Dike, Millard Sheets, Rex Brandt, Dong Kingman, and Milford Zornes. The California Water Color Society, founded in 1921 and later renamed the National Watercolor Society, sponsored important exhibitions of their work. The largest watercolor in the world at the moment (at tall and wide) is &quot;Building 6 Portrait: Interior.&quot; Produced by American artist Barbara Prey on commission for MASS MoCA, the work can be seen at MASS MoCA&#x27;s Robert W. Wilson Building.

Although the rise of abstract expressionism, and the trivializing influence of amateur painters and advertising- or workshop-influenced painting styles, led to a temporary decline in the popularity of watercolor painting after , watercolors continue to be utilized by artists like Martha Burchfield, Joseph Raffael, Andrew Wyeth, Philip Pearlstein, Eric Fischl, Gerhard Richter, Anselm Kiefer, and Francesco Clemente. In Spain, Ceferí Olivé created an innovative style followed by his students, such as Rafael Alonso López-Montero and Francesc Torné Gavaldà. In Mexico, the major exponents are Ignacio Barrios, Edgardo Coghlan, Ángel Mauro, Vicente Mendiola, and Pastor Velázquez. In the Canary Islands, where this pictorial technique has many followers, there are stand-out artists such as Francisco Bonnín Guerín, José Comas Quesada, and Alberto Manrique.

==Watercolor paint==
Watercolor paint consists of four principal ingredients: a pigment; gum arabic as a binder to hold the pigment in suspension; additives like glycerin, ox gall, honey, and preservatives to alter the viscosity, hiding, durability or color of the pigment and vehicle mixture; and, evaporating water, as a solvent used to thin or dilute the paint for application.

The more general term &quot;watermedia&quot; refers to any painting medium that uses water as a solvent and that can be applied with a brush, pen, or sprayer. This includes most inks, watercolors, temperas, caseins, gouaches, and modern acrylic paints.

The term &quot;watercolor&quot; refers to paints that use water-soluble, complex carbohydrates as a binder. Originally (in the 16th to 18th centuries), watercolor binders were sugars and/or hide glues, but since the 19th century, the preferred binder is natural gum arabic, with glycerin and/or honey as additives to improve plasticity and solubility of the binder, and with other chemicals added to improve product shelf life.

The term &quot;bodycolor&quot; refers to paint that is opaque rather than transparent. It usually refers to opaque watercolor, known as gouache. Modern acrylic paints use an acrylic resin dispersion as a binder.

===Commercial watercolors===

Watercolor painters before the turn of the 18th century had to make paints themselves using pigments purchased from an apothecary or specialized &quot;colorman&quot;, and mixing them with gum arabic or some other binder. The earliest commercial paints were small, resinous blocks that had to be wetted and laboriously &quot;rubbed out&quot; in water to obtain a usable color intensity. William Reeves started his business as a colorman around 1766. In 1781, he and his brother, Thomas Reeves, were awarded the Silver Palette of the Society of Arts, for the invention of the moist watercolor &quot;paint-cake&quot;, a time-saving convenience, introduced in the &quot;golden age&quot; of English watercolor painting. The &quot;cake&quot; was immediately soluble when touched by a wet brush.

Modern commercial watercolor paints are available in tubes, pans and liquids. The majority of paints sold today are in collapsible small metal tubes in standard sizes and formulated to a consistency similar to toothpaste by being already mixed with a certain water component. For use, this paste has to be further diluted with water. Pan paints (small dried cakes or bars of paint in an open plastic container) are usually sold in two sizes, full pans and half pans.

Owing to modern industrial organic chemistry, the variety, saturation, and permanence of artists&#x27; colors available today has been vastly improved. Correct and non-toxic primary colors are now present through the introduction of hansa yellow, phthalo blue and quinacridone. From such a set of three colors, in principle all others can be mixed, as in a classical technique no white is used. The modern development of pigments was not driven by artistic demand. The art materials industry is too small to exert any market leverage on global dye or pigment manufacture. With rare exceptions such as aureolin, all modern watercolor paints utilize pigments that have a wider industrial use. Paint manufacturers buy, by industrial standards very small, supplies of these pigments, mill them with the vehicle, solvent, and additives, and package them. The milling process with inorganic pigments, in more expensive brands, reduces the particle size to improve the color flow when the paint is applied with water.

===Transparency===
In the partisan debates of the 19th-century English art world, gouache was emphatically contrasted to traditional watercolors and denigrated for its high hiding power or lack of &quot;transparency&quot;; &quot;transparent&quot; watercolors were exalted. The aversion to opaque paint had its origin in the fact that well into the 19th century lead white was used to increase the covering quality. That pigment tended to soon discolor into black under the influence of sulphurous air pollution, totally ruining the artwork. The traditional claim that &quot;transparent&quot; watercolors gain &quot;luminosity&quot; because they function like a pane of stained glass laid on paper—the color intensified because the light passes through the pigment, reflects from the paper, and passes a second time through the pigment on its way to the viewer—is false. Watercolor paints typically do not form a cohesive paint layer, as do acrylic or oil paints, but simply scatter pigment particles randomly across the paper surface; the transparency is caused by the paper being visible between the particles. Watercolors may appear more vivid than acrylics or oils because the pigments are laid down in a purer form, with few or no fillers (such as kaolin) obscuring the pigment colors. Typically, most or all of the gum binder will be absorbed by the paper, preventing the binder from changing the visibility of the pigment. The gum being absorbed does not decrease but increase the adhesion of the pigment to the paper, as its particles will then penetrate the fibres more easily. In fact, an important function of the gum is to facilitate the &quot;lifting&quot; (removal) of color, should the artist want to create a lighter spot in a painted area. Furthermore, the gum prevents flocculation of the pigment particles.

<text>Black Wednesday, or the 1992 sterling crisis, was a financial crisis that occurred on 16 September 1992 when the UK Government was forced to withdraw sterling from the (first) European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERMI), following a failed attempt to keep its exchange rate above the lower limit required for ERM participation. At that time, the United Kingdom held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

The crisis damaged the credibility of the second Major ministry in handling of economic matters. The ruling Conservative Party suffered a landslide defeat five years later at the 1997 general election and did not return to power until 2010. The rebounding of the UK economy in the years following Black Wednesday has been attributed to the depreciation of sterling and the replacement of its currency tracking policy with an inflation targeting monetary stability policy.

==Prelude==

When the ERM was set up in 1979, the United Kingdom declined to join. This was a controversial decision, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Geoffrey Howe, was staunchly pro-European. His successor, Nigel Lawson, whilst not at all advocating a fixed exchange rate system, nevertheless so admired the low inflationary record of West Germany as to become, by the mid-eighties, a self-styled &quot;exchange-rate monetarist&quot;, one viewing the sterling–Deutschmark exchange rate as at least as reliable a guide to domestic inflation and hence to the setting of interest rates as any of the various M0-M3 measures beloved of those he labelled as &quot;Simon Pure&quot; monetarists. He justified this by pointing to the dependable strength of the Deutsche Mark and the reliably anti-inflationary management of the Mark by the Bundesbank, both of which he explained by citing the lasting impact in Germany of the disastrous hyperinflation of the inter-war Weimar Republic. Thus, although the UK had not joined the ERM, at Lawson&#x27;s direction (and with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s reluctant acquiescence), from early 1987 to March 1988 the Treasury followed a semi-official policy of &quot;shadowing&quot; the Deutsche Mark. Matters came to a head in a clash between Lawson and Thatcher&#x27;s economic adviser Alan Walters, when Walters claimed that the Exchange Rate Mechanism was &quot;half baked&quot;.

This led to Lawson&#x27;s resignation as Chancellor; he was replaced by former Treasury Chief Secretary John Major who, with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, convinced the Cabinet to sign Britain up to the ERM in October 1990, effectively guaranteeing that the UK Government would follow an economic and monetary policy preventing the exchange rate between the pound and other member currencies from fluctuating by more than 6%. On 8 October 1990, Thatcher entered the pound into the ERM at DM2.95 to £1. Hence, if the exchange rate ever neared the bottom of its permitted range, DM2.773 (€1.4178 at the DM/Euro conversion rate), the government would be obliged to intervene. In 1989, the UK had inflation three times the rate of Germany, higher interest rates at 15%, and much lower labour productivity than France and Germany, which indicated the UK&#x27;s different economic state in comparison to other ERM countries.

From the beginning of the 1990s, high German interest rates, set by the Bundesbank to counteract inflationary effects related to excess expenditure on German reunification, caused significant stress across the whole of the ERM. The UK and Italy had additional difficulties with their double deficits, while the UK was also hurt by the rapid depreciation of the United States dollar – a currency in which many British exports were priced – that summer. Issues of national prestige and the commitment to a doctrine that the fixing of exchange rates within the ERM was a pathway to a single European currency inhibited the adjustment of exchange rates. In the wake of the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty by the Danish electorate in a referendum in the spring of 1992, and an announcement that there would be a referendum in France as well, those ERM currencies that were trading close to the bottom of their ERM bands came under pressure from foreign exchange traders.

In the months leading up to Black Wednesday, among many other currency traders, George Soros had been building a huge short position in sterling that would become immensely profitable if the currency fell below the lower band of the ERM. Soros believed the rate at which the United Kingdom was brought into the Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, inflation was too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.

==The currency traders act==
The UK government attempted to prop up the depreciating pound to avoid withdrawal from the monetary system the country had joined only two years earlier. John Major authorised the spending of billions of pounds worth of foreign currency reserves to buy up sterling being sold on the currency markets. These measures failed to prevent the pound falling below its minimum level in the ERM. The Treasury took the decision to defend sterling&#x27;s position, believing that to devalue would promote inflation.

Remarks by Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger triggered the attack on the pound. An interview of Schlesinger by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; was reported by the German financial paper . Schlesinger told the journalist that &quot;a more comprehensive realignment&quot; of currencies would be needed, following a recent devaluation of the Italian lira. On the evening of Tuesday, 15 September 1992, the headline was already circulating. Schlesinger said he thought he was speaking off the record. He later wrote that he stated a fact and this could not have triggered the crisis. This remark hugely increased pressure on the pound leading to large sterling sales.

Currency traders began a massive sell-off of pounds on Wednesday, 16 September 1992. The Exchange Rate Mechanism required the Bank of England to accept any offers to sell pounds. However, the Bank of England only accepted orders during the trading day. When the markets opened in London the next morning, the Bank of England began their attempt to prop up their currency, as decided by Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England. They began accepting orders of £300 million twice before 8:30 am, but to little effect. The Bank of England&#x27;s intervention was ineffective because traders were dumping pounds far faster. The Bank of England continued to buy, and traders continued to sell, until Lamont told Prime Minister John Major that their pound purchasing was failing to produce results.

At 10:30 am on 16 September, the British government announced an increase in the base interest rate, from an already high 10%, to 12% to tempt speculators to buy pounds. Despite this and a promise later the same day to raise base rates again to 15%, dealers kept selling pounds, convinced that the government would not keep its promise. By 7:00 pm that evening, Lamont announced Britain would leave the ERM and rates would remain at the new level of 12%; however, on the next day the interest rate was back to 10%.

It was later revealed that the decision to withdraw had been agreed at an emergency meeting during the day between Lamont, Major, foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, president of the Board of Trade Michael Heseltine, and home secretary Kenneth Clarke (the latter three all being staunch pro-Europeans as well as senior Cabinet ministers), and that the interest rate hike to 15% had only been a temporary measure to prevent a rout in the pound that afternoon.

==Aftermath==
Other ERM countries such as Italy, whose currencies had breached their bands during the day, returned to the system with broadened bands or with adjusted central parities.

Some commentators, following Norman Tebbit, took to referring to ERM as an &quot;Eternal Recession Mechanism&quot; after the UK fell into recession during the early 1990s. While many people in the UK recall Black Wednesday as a national disaster that permanently affected the country&#x27;s international prestige, some Conservatives claim that the forced ejection from the ERM was a &quot;Golden Wednesday&quot; or &quot;White Wednesday&quot;, the day that paved the way for an economic revival, with the Conservatives handing Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour a much stronger economy in 1997 than had existed in 1992 as the new economic policy swiftly devised in the aftermath of Black Wednesday led to re-establishment of economic growth with falling unemployment and inflation. Monetary policy switched to inflation targeting.

The Conservative Party government&#x27;s reputation for economic excellence had been damaged to the extent that the electorate was more inclined to support a claim of the opposition of the time – that the economic recovery ought to be credited to external factors, as opposed to government policies implemented by the Conservatives. The Conservatives had recently won the 1992 general election, and the Gallup poll for September showed a small lead of 2.5% for the Conservative Party. By the October poll, following Black Wednesday, their share of the intended vote in the poll had plunged from 43% to 29%. The Conservative government then suffered a string of by-election defeats which saw its 21-seat majority eroded by December 1996. The party&#x27;s performances in local government elections were similarly dismal during this time, while Labour made huge gains.

Black Wednesday was a major factor in the Conservatives losing the 1997 general election to Labour, who won by a landslide under the leadership of Tony Blair. The Conservatives failed to gain significant ground at the 2001 general election under the leadership of William Hague, with Labour winning another landslide majority. The Conservatives did not take Government again until David Cameron led them to victory in the 2010 general election, 13 years later. Five years later in 2015, the party won its first overall majority 23 years after its last in 1992, five months before the crisis.

George Soros made over £1 billion in profit by short selling sterling.

==The cost of Black Wednesday==
In 1997, the UK Treasury estimated the cost of Black Wednesday at £3.14 billion, which was revised to £3.3 billion in 2005, following documents released under the Freedom of Information Act (earlier estimates placed losses at a much higher range of £13–27 billion). Trading losses in August and September made up a small part of the total (estimated at £800 million); the bulk of the loss to the central bank arose from non-realised profits of a potential devaluation. Treasury papers suggested that, had the government maintained $24 billion foreign currency reserves and the pound had fallen by the same amount, the UK might have made a £2.4 billion profit on sterling&#x27;s devaluation.

<text>Santiago Metropolitan Region () is one of Chile&#x27;s 16 first-order administrative divisions. It is the country&#x27;s only landlocked administrative region and contains the nation&#x27;s capital, Santiago. Most commercial and administrative centers are located in the region, including Chile&#x27;s main international airport, Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport.

With an area of and population over seven million, it is Chile&#x27;s most populated and most densely populated region.

==History==
The region&#x27;s history of European influence started in 1542, a few days after Santiago was founded. When the Santiago cabildo was built, its function was to supervise the entire territory. Later, with the creation of the cities of La Serena and Concepción and the creation of their respective cabildos, its territorial reach was reduced.

On 30 August 1826, 8 provinces were created, with the Santiago Province being one of them, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1980 that the Metropolitan Region was created.

==Geography==
Metropolitana is Chile&#x27;s only landlocked region and lies in the Intermediate Depression valley between the Chilean Coast Range and the Andes mountains. Cerro San Cristóbal dominates the sprawling Santiago cityscape at a height of above sea level with city suburbs steadily climbing the foothills of the Andes to the east. The Tupungato stratovolcano, measures on the Argentine border, is one of South America&#x27;s highest peaks.

The dominant drainage basin feeds into the Maipo River; its main tributaries are the Mapocho, Yeso and Colorado rivers.

==Climate and natural features==

The climate of the Metropolitan Region is temperate Mediterranean cold, of the kind called &quot;continental&quot;. Precipitation is concentrated in the winter months, generally as snow over 900 m above sea level and, in colder years, over the city of Santiago. Winter tends to be cold with frequent frosts during which temperature drops below . The summer months are usually dry and hot. The Cordillera de la Costa acts as a climate screen and reduces marine influence, which makes the climate more continental. This situation becomes apparent when comparing precipitation from a coastal location such as Valparaíso (460 mm) with that of Santiago de Chile (360 mm).

The annual median precipitation reaches 367 mm on average. The annual median temperature comes out to , with a median high of and a median low of in urban areas. Rural areas tend to be colder, as temperature reaches in the coldest months (July, August)

Most of the region is made up of an extremely fertile, level prairie that the locals call &quot;la Depresión intermedia&quot; (Intermediate Depression). The terrain is known for its low elevation in relation to sea level and for being surrounded by hills, as well as emergent so-called &quot;island hills&quot;, such as Santa Lucía (an ancient extinct volcano), Blanco, and Renca, present today in the city of Santiago.

There is some occurrence of the endangered Chilean Wine Palm, &quot;Jubaea chilensis&quot; within the Santiago Province; this iconic tree of central Chile had a much larger range prehistorically, before the decimation of much of its habitat by the expanding human population.

==Economy and culture==
The region&#x27;s principal industries include manufacturing, services, retail, and financial services. The capital of Santiago serves as the country&#x27;s administrative, industrial, commercial, financial and cultural center, producing 41.5% of Chile&#x27;s gross domestic product, according to central bank estimates. The Plaza de Armas, the central square in downtown Santiago, hosts the city&#x27;s cathedral and city hall. Eight city blocks around the presidential palace, La Moneda, are where most ministries, services and commercial banks can be found. Vitacura and El Golf host most of the city&#x27;s high-rise buildings and are also home to the Latin American headquarters of several United Nations organizations. Though Santiago&#x27;s expansion has caused newer vineyards to move to more rural locations, many of the country&#x27;s oldest wineries, built in the 19th century, have preserved cellars in the valley.

==Government and administration==
The region is divided into 6 provinces, which are themselves divided into 52 communes. Since 2021 the region is governed by the governor, who is elected by popular vote. The current governor is Claudio Orrego Larraín (Independent).
