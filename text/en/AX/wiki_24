<text>The WB Television Network (shortened to The WB, stylized as &quot;THE WB&quot;, and nicknamed the &quot;Frog Network&quot; and/or &quot;The Frog&quot; for its former mascot Michigan J. Frog) was an American television network launched on broadcast television on January 11, 1995, as a joint venture amongst the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner, the Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary of the Tribune Company, and Jamie Kellner, with the first acting as controlling partner (and from which The WB received its name). The network aired programs targeting teenagers and young adults between the ages of 13 and 35, while its children&#x27;s division, Kids&#x27; WB, targeted children between the ages of 4 and 12.

On January 24, 2006, Warner Bros. and CBS Corporation announced plans to replace their respective subsidiary networks, The WB and UPN, with The CW later that same year. The WB ceased operations on September 17, 2006, with some programs from both it and competitor UPN (which had shut down on September 15) moving to The CW when it launched the following day, September 18.

Time Warner re-used the WB brand for an online network that launched on April 28, 2008, and then August 27, 2008. Until it was closed in December 2013, the website allowed users to watch shows aired on the former television network, as well as programming from the defunct In2TV service created prior to Time Warner&#x27;s spinoff of AOL. The website could only be accessed within the United States.

==History==
===1993–1995: Origins===
Much like its competitor UPN, The WB was created primarily in reaction to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s then-recent deregulation of media ownership rules that repealed the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, and partly due to the success of the Fox network (which debuted in October 1986) and first-run syndicated programming during the late 1980s and early 1990s (such as &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;), as well as the erosion in ratings suffered by independent television stations due to the growth of cable television and movie rentals. The network can also trace its beginnings to the Prime Time Entertainment Network (PTEN), a programming service operated as a joint venture between Time Warner and the Chris-Craft Industries group of stations, and launched in January 1989. It is known that both The WB &amp; UPN were recognized as the fifth major US TV network after Fox, due to the intent behind both networks&#x27; creation, despite The WB &amp; UPN&#x27;s positions as the fifth &amp; sixth national TV networks, respectively.

On November 2, 1993, the Warner Bros. division of Time Warner announced the formation of The WB Television Network, with the Tribune Company holding a minority interest. As such, Tribune Broadcasting signed agreements to affiliate six of its seven television stations at the time – all of which were independent stations, including the television group&#x27;s two largest stations, WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles – with the network. Only five of these stations, along with a sixth that Tribune acquired the following year, would join The WB at launch; the company&#x27;s Atlanta independent WGNX would instead agree to affiliate with CBS in September 1994, as a result of Fox&#x27;s affiliation deal with New World Communications, then-owner of longtime CBS station WAGA-TV. In contrast, New Orleans sister station WGNO did become a WB charter affiliate before joining ABC in January 1996 due to a similar affiliation deal between Fox and SF Broadcasting, owner of longtime ABC station WVUE-TV.

On December 3, 1993, The WB announced a separate affiliation agreement with Tribune for its Chicago flagship station WGN-TV (which originally planned to remain an independent station due to concerns about handling its sports programming commitments while maintaining a network affiliation); through this deal, WGN&#x27;s superstation feed would provide additional national distribution for The WB as a cable-only affiliate, in order to give the network time to fill gaps in markets where it was unable to find an affiliate at launch. Although Tribune had a minority stake in the network, its stations were not technically considered owned-and-operated stations of The WB since Time Warner held controlling interest in the network&#x27;s ownership.

When the network was announced, The WB planned to run a predominantly network-programmed schedule over time. It was originally slated to launch with two nights of primetime programming in its first year, and two additional nights of primetime programming, a nightly half-hour in late primetime, 4½ hours of weekday daytime programming and a four-hour Saturday morning children&#x27;s lineup in its second year. By the third year, a fifth night of primetime and 1½ hours of weekday programming outside of primetime would have been added, followed by an additional hour of programming in primetime and 1½ hours on weekday afternoons by the network&#x27;s fourth year, and a seventh night of primetime in the fifth year of operation. However, this plan was scaled back dramatically, partly to address potential sports-related programming conflicts on WGN and certain other affiliates (including WPIX and KTLA), as The WB launched with only one night of primetime programming; and by September 1995, the network added only one additional night (Sundays), along with a three-hour Saturday morning (later expanded to four, then five hours), one-hour weekday morning and two-hour weekday afternoon children&#x27;s block.

Warner Bros. appointed many former Fox executives to run the network, including the network&#x27;s original chief executive Jamie Kellner, who served as president of Fox from 1986 to 1993; and president of programming Garth Ancier, who was the programming chief of Fox from 1986 to 1989.

===1995–1997: Beginnings===
The WB Television Network launched on January 11, 1995, with the debut airing of the first episode of &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; (a sitcom starring comedians Shawn and Marlon Wayans) as its first program. The classic Warner Bros. cartoon character Michigan J. Frog appeared on-air as the network&#x27;s official mascot (with animator Chuck Jones, in person, drawing him out after Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck argued about who should launch The WB during the network&#x27;s premiere), and would remain as part of the network&#x27;s branding in one form or another until 2005.

Much of the network&#x27;s branding was based around Warner Bros. locations and characters: the television network&#x27;s original logo (which was originally displayed upright until 1998, and displayed at a titled angle thereafter) was based on the typography of the iconic Warner Bros. Pictures&#x27; &quot;shield&quot; logo; network promotions and imaging campaigns for The WB and the Kids&#x27; WB block from their launches until the 2003–2004 season were also respectively centered on the Warner Bros. Studios backlot and the Warner Bros. Ranch Facilities, often involving large marquee signs promoting the nights of programming and their component shows (at times including signs for Kids&#x27; WB and certain shows from that block); this approach was similar to one used for Fox&#x27;s 1989–90 &quot;This is the Year&quot; fall campaign (likely borrowed for The WB by former Fox executives Kellner and Ancier). Local station IDs initially used by some WB affiliates until 1997—set to a soft orchestral theme incorporating the musical signature of &quot;Hello Ma Baby&quot;—featured moving projections of the &quot;WB&quot; lettering on CGI models of the Warner Bros. studio lot, with the end tag (in which the affiliate&#x27;s logo is displayed) prominently featuring the lot&#x27;s water tower next to a translucent outline of the &quot;WB&quot; logotype (which is briefly lit up as the image zooms out to show the tower and model soundstages).

The WB&#x27;s scheduling structure was similar to Fox&#x27;s when it launched, as it started with one night a week of programming and then gradually added additional nights of programming over the course of several seasons: the network started with a two-hour Wednesday night lineup of sitcoms, airing from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. The limited amount of network programming in The WB&#x27;s early years essentially rendered its affiliates as nominal independent stations; because of this, affiliates held the responsibility of programming primetime slots on nights that the network did not program, airing either first-run and/or off-network syndicated programs or more commonly, movies.

Several of the network&#x27;s first programs were black sitcoms. Four of the five shows that debuted in the network&#x27;s first nine months were renewed beyond the first year – &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot; (a dysfunctional family sitcom from &quot;Married... with Children&quot; co-creator Ron Leavitt), &quot;The Parent &#x27;Hood&quot; (a family sitcom starring and co-created by Robert Townsend), and &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; (a teen/blended family sitcom starring Tia and Tamera Mowry that was picked up by the network after its cancellation by ABC in the spring of 1995). The four shows had a lasting impact on audiences, while a fifth show, &quot;Muscle&quot; (a sitcom that parodied primetime soap operas), was canceled after one season due to low ratings, and ultimately replaced with &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;.

On August 17, 1995, the Tribune Company acquired a 12.5% limited partnership interest in The WB for $12 million; the deal gave Tribune an option to increase its stake in the network up to a 25% interest; Tribune would eventually increase its ownership share in The WB to 22.5% on March 31, 1997.

The WB expanded its programming to Sunday nights for the 1995–96 season, but none of the new shows (including the Kirk Cameron vehicle &quot;Kirk&quot; and night-time soap opera &quot;Savannah&quot;) managed to garner much viewing interest. The network also launched the Kids&#x27; WB programming block in September 1995, which featured a mix of existing Warner Bros. animated series that originated either on Fox Kids or in syndication and originally aired on Monday through Saturday mornings. The WB continued to expand in the 1996–97 season, adding programming on Monday nights. This season gave The WB modest hits in the Aaron Spelling-produced family drama &quot;7th Heaven&quot; (centering on a reverend and his family) and comedies &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; (starring Harvey as a funk musician working as a music teacher at an inner-city Chicago high school), and &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot; (starring Foxx as an aspiring actor/singer working at a Los Angeles hotel owned by his aunt and uncle).

===1997–2000: Courting the teen market===
The WB first had success with &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (a series based on the 1992 film of the same name) which became a hit with critics when it premiered as a mid-season replacement in March 1997. The series debuted with the highest Monday night ratings in the network&#x27;s history, attracting not only new teenage viewers, but new advertisers as well.

Inspired by &quot;Buffy&quot;″s success, The WB intentionally shifted the focus of its programming, trying to capture what it perceived to be a heavily fragmented market by marketing to the under-courted teen demographic. While the Fox network, the previous destination for teen television (with shows such as &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Party of Five&quot; and &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;), began to court older audiences with shows such as &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, The WB began to craft its identity with programs targeted at teenagers. The network&#x27;s breakout hit and, arguably, its signature series was &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, which debuted in January 1998 to what were then the highest ratings in the network&#x27;s history (and made stars out of its four principal actors, James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams, Joshua Jackson, and Katie Holmes). The series was produced by Columbia TriStar Television and it quickly became the highest-rated show on television among teenage girls, and the most popular program on The WB. The popularity of &quot;Dawson&quot; helped boost the network&#x27;s other shows, such as &quot;Buffy&quot;, which served as its lead-in on The WB&#x27;s new night of programming that also launched in January 1998, branded as &quot;New Tuesday&quot;, and &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, which enjoyed a massive 81% increase in viewership that season.

With three hit shows in its roster, The WB continued to build its teen fanbase the following season with college drama &quot;Felicity&quot; (which made a star out of lead Keri Russell) and the wicca-themed &quot;Charmed&quot; (which was also produced by Aaron Spelling, and co-starred Alyssa Milano, Holly Marie Combs and &quot;90210&quot; alumna Shannen Doherty), both of which set new records for the network when they respectively premiered to 7.1 and 7.7 million viewers; &quot;Charmed&quot; had the highest-rated premiere on the network until &quot;Smallville&quot; broke its record, debuting to 8.4 million viewers in October 2001. At the start of the 1998–99 season, the network expanded its programming to Thursday nights. That season, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; overtook &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; as the network&#x27;s highest-rated program, and garnered The WB the highest ratings it would ever see – the show&#x27;s February 8, 1999, episode attracted 12.5 million viewers.

For the 1999–2000 season, the network concluded its primetime expansion with the addition of programming on Friday nights. New shows that season included &quot;Roswell&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, and the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;, the latter of which premiered with 7.5 million viewers – the second-highest rated premiere for the network at the time. During this season, The WB was the only network to have gains in its total audience viewership and in each key demographic.

===2000–2003: Broadening the focus===
As the teen boom of the late 1990s began to wane, The WB attempted to broaden the scope of its primetime lineup. Although teen-oriented fare like &quot;Popular&quot; and &quot;Roswell&quot; had premiered to strong ratings, both series saw serious ratings erosion in their sophomore seasons, leading the network to cancel them both (&quot;Roswell&quot;, like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, would end up being revived by rival network UPN). Meanwhile, even though ratings for &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Charmed&quot; remained consistent, viewership for flagship series such as &quot;Felicity&quot; and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; began sagging. The network realized that it could no longer rely merely on the tastes of young teenage girls, and thus began moving back into more family-friendly fare, attempting to launch a successful sitcom, and generally targeting a more diverse audience.

This new strategy came as The WB had dropped to sixth place in the ratings among all major broadcast networks (behind UPN) during the 1999–2000 season, losing 19% of its household audience. Executives for the network attributed the ratings decline in large part due to the Tribune Company&#x27;s decision to remove WB network programming from WGN-TV&#x27;s superstation feed in October 1999, on the pretense that the network&#x27;s national distribution was large enough that it was no longer necessary for WGN to broadcast The WB&#x27;s programs outside of Chicago; the network reached several affiliation deals during the prior four years with various station owners (such as the Sinclair Broadcast Group and Pappas Telecasting Companies), buoyed by the September 1998 launch of The WB 100+ Station Group, a national cable-only service that served most of the 110 smallest Nielsen media markets in the United States that did not have enough television stations to support an over-the-air affiliate. The removal of The WB&#x27;s programs from the WGN national feed effectively reduced the network&#x27;s potential household audience by 10 million homes (WGN-TV continued to carry WB programming over-the-air and on cable within the Chicago market until the network shut down in 2006).

Despite the slight downturn in the network&#x27;s fortunes, there were a few bright spots during the era. &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, which debuted in 2000, netted meager ratings when it debuted in a tough Thursday timeslot (where it competed against NBC&#x27;s powerhouse Must See TV lineup), but subsequently grew into one of the network&#x27;s most successful shows after moving to Tuesdays in 2001, where it remained for six seasons (before moving to The CW for its seventh and final season). Also in the fall of 2000, the fantasy sitcom &quot;Sabrina, the Teenage Witch&quot; moved from ABC to The WB as part of its Friday night schedule; the show continued on the network for three more seasons before ending in May 2003.

Time Warner transferred operational duties for The WB from Warner Bros. over to its Turner Broadcasting System division in 2001. On November 12, 2002, chairman Jamie Kellner – who became chairman and chief executive officer of the Turner Broadcasting System concurrent with that deal – sold his 11% stake in The WB to majority corporate parent AOL Time Warner, leaving it and minority owner, the Tribune Company, as the only partners in the network. Following Kellner&#x27;s departure from Turner, AOL Time Warner reassigned the network&#x27;s operations back to the Warner Bros. unit in 2003.

In October 2001, the Superman-inspired &quot;Smallville&quot; debuted with 8.4 million viewers, the highest-rated premiere in the history of the network; that show was also important because it was one of the few series that drew a substantial male viewership. 2001 also saw the launch of the Reba McEntire vehicle &quot;Reba&quot;, arguably the network&#x27;s most successful comedy; &quot;Reba&quot; and &quot;Sabrina&quot; served as the linchpins of a new Friday night sitcom block that debuted in October 2001 (delayed from a mid-September launch, as other networks did with their fall schedules following the September 11 terrorist attacks) and continued for much of the remainder of the network&#x27;s run (comedies on that night were relegated to one hour in April 2006, with reality series filling the 8:00 p.m. hour). Other series to gain attention during this period were the family drama &quot;Everwood&quot;, and the short-lived but critically acclaimed soap satire &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot;.

===2003–2006: Decline===
Despite some early success, The WB struggled to shift its focus from the female 12–24 demographic to the broader 12–34 range, in its attempt to attract a broader young adult audience. In 2005, The WB retired Michigan J. Frog, as The WB&#x27;s trademark mascot. The WB&#x27;s president of entertainment at the time, David Janollari, explained in July 2005 at the network&#x27;s summer press tour that &quot;[Michigan] was a symbol that perpetuated the young-teen feel of the network. That&#x27;s not the image we [now] want to put to our audience.&quot;

Still, the move did not seem to help The WB. The period from 2003 to 2005 produced only three viable new series, the teen-oriented drama &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, social experiment reality competition &quot;Beauty and the Geek&quot;, and fantasy drama &quot;Supernatural&quot; (all of which ultimately moved to successor network The CW), and even still their ratings paled in comparison to the ratings peaks of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, which had ended its run in May 2003. Ratings dropped for many of The WB&#x27;s shows, while also cancelling shows with steady ratings such as &quot;Angel&quot;; the network failed to launch new hit shows to take their places.

Although The WB&#x27;s well-known inability to launch successful comedy series was nothing new (&quot;Reba&quot; being a notable exception), this period saw The WB struggling to establish new dramas as well. High-profile failures included &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (a series inspired by the Batman mythos, which premiered in October 2002 with an impressive 8 share), &quot;Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot;, &quot;The Mountain&quot;, the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced legal dramedy &quot;Just Legal&quot;, the Marta Kauffman-created dramedy &quot;Related&quot;, and the Rebecca Romijn vehicle &quot;Pepper Dennis&quot;.

During the 2004–05 season, The WB finished behind rival UPN for the first time in four years and fell even further behind in fall 2005. Both networks fell behind Spanish language network Univision in the overall 18–34 demographic. Between November and December 2005, the network laid off approximately 40 employees amid continued ratings and profit losses (with viewership down 12% by November 2005), with network representatives expecting The WB to lose about $35 million during the 2005–06 fiscal year. The WB was programming six days and 13 hours per week at this time.

=== 2006: Network closure ===

On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. Entertainment announced plans to shut down both UPN and The WB and partner to launch a new broadcast television network that would include series from both soon-to-be predecessor networks, known as The CW. Over the next eight months, it was to be seen which shows from the two networks would cross over to The CW, as well as which stations aligned with either UPN or The WB would become future affiliates of the new network. In the end, seven shows from The WB, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Geek&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Reba&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, and &quot;Supernatural&quot; were chosen to move to The CW for its inaugural 2006–07 fall schedule. &quot;7th Heaven&quot; and &quot;Reba&quot; were originally canceled after the 2005–06 season but were ultimately renewed at the last minute with 13-episode deals (&quot;7th Heaven&quot; was later given a full-season order, while &quot;Reba&quot; served as a midseason replacement and, despite becoming The CW&#x27;s highest-rated comedy of the 2006–07 season, ended rather abruptly). &quot;Supernatural&quot;, which aired its final (15th) season in the fall of 2020, was the last surviving series from The WB that remained on the CW network schedule.

Tribune Broadcasting also committed 16 of its 19 WB-affiliated stations at the time to serve as the network&#x27;s core affiliates (though it relinquished its stake in The WB shortly after the launch announcement for The CW, in order to avoid shouldering shutdown costs for The WB, and would not take on an ownership stake in The CW) – alongside 11 UPN O&amp;Os that were named as CW charter stations by CBS Corporation. Starting on August 14, 2006, with the Daytime WB block, The WB stopped displaying its on-screen logo bug during the network&#x27;s programming and replaced it with a countdown of days until The CW&#x27;s premiere. Some stations that either affiliated with MyNetworkTV (itself created in response to Tribune and CBS receiving affiliation deals with The CW, leaving UPN affiliates owned by Fox Television Stations, a subsidiary of MyNetworkTV&#x27;s original parent company News Corporation, with the prospect of ending up as independents), became independent stations or became CW charter affiliates received a logo-free feed of the network, while others took the main feed and overlaid the station&#x27;s own logo bug over The CW&#x27;s logo.

The WB aired its final night of programming on September 17, 2006, with The Night of Favorites and Farewells, a five-hour block of pilot episodes of the network&#x27;s past signature series. Commercial breaks featured re-airings of past image campaigns and network promotions, along with promotional spots given to cable networks carrying these shows in off-network syndication and ads for each series&#x27; TV-on-DVD box set. The 60-second montage that closed The WB&#x27;s existence featured many well-known stars from shows which aired during the 11-year run of the network, ending with the statement:

&quot;&quot;For 11 years, you brought us into your homes. We made you smile and tugged at your heart. And now, we say goodbye. From all of us at The WB, thank you.&quot;&quot;

The final image seen in the montage was former network mascot Michigan J. Frog (who was shown as a silhouette due to the animated character being retired as The WB&#x27;s mascot the year before), who is shown taking his hat off and bowing, thanking the audience for watching the network for 11 years and marking the end of The WB.

Shortly thereafter, after the studio credits (instead of The WB&#x27;s standard credits scheme) for the &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; pilot aired, several former WB affiliates acknowledged their switch to The CW on their newscasts, with most adopting their new CW branding immediately. One instance of this was New York City affiliate WPIX, who aired a montage of logos the station has used throughout its history, leading up to its new &quot;CW11&quot; logo before the start of its 10:00 p.m. newscast.

The final night of WB programming netted relatively low ratings. The network scored a 1.0 household rating (amounting to 1% of all U.S. television households) and a share of 2, meaning just 2% of viewers were tuned into The WB on its final night of programming. This was mostly due to the fact that some WB affiliates in certain areas had already joined MyNetworkTV, which debuted on September 5, two weeks before The CW&#x27;s launch, leaving The WB&#x27;s final two weeks of programming unavailable in those areas. After its closure, the network&#x27;s URLs were redirected to The CW&#x27;s website, cwtv.com. By March 30, 2008, the URLs redirected to the Warner Bros. Studios homepage, before being redirected to the TheWB.com beta website one month later on April 28.

The CW maintained many operational and scheduling elements from The WB. When it launched on September 18, 2006, The CW initially maintained The WB&#x27;s scheduling model; The WB had carried 30 hours of network programming each week (13 of which were devoted to primetime shows) in comparison to UPN&#x27;s weekly programming total of 12 hours (10 hours of which were allocated to primetime shows). It also inherited The WB 100+ Station Group – which became The CW Plus – though the distribution model of The CW Plus started to differ from The WB 100+ by mixing digital subchannel affiliations, alongside the cable-only affiliates and few conventional affiliate stations that were part of the predecessor group at the end of The WB&#x27;s run. The CW continued the Daytime WB block – which became The CW Daytime (and was reduced from two hours to one in 2010), although three blocks that moved to The CW from The WB would eventually be discontinued: Kids&#x27; WB continued on The CW until May 17, 2008, when it was replaced with The CW4Kids after 4Kids Entertainment began programming The CW&#x27;s Saturday morning block through a time-lease agreement (Kids&#x27; WB was later relaunched as an online portal); The CW discontinued its Sunday primetime schedule in September 2009, effectively ending the EasyView block in the process (The CW returned to Sunday primetime nights on October 14, 2018, but with only two hours to program), and dropped the CW Daytime block in the 2021–22 season in favor of a weekly Saturday-night primetime schedule.

===2008–2013: Internet streaming===

Warner Bros.&#x27; television arm planned on resurrecting the WB brand in the form of a website at TheWB.com, the website domain used for the official site of the broadcast network. The site streamed episodes of series that were broadcast during The WB&#x27;s 1995–2006 run, including &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Everwood&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;Roswell&quot;, and &quot;What I Like About You&quot;. The new incarnation of the TheWB.com began in beta testing on April 28, 2008, and officially launched on August 27, 2008. The site – whose business model resembled that of free-to-stream services such as Hulu – was ad-supported and geared primarily to men, and women ages 15–39. In addition to older full-length series (among which also included &quot;All of Us&quot;, &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Jack &amp; Bobby&quot;, and &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;), the website featured original serialized web content including short series and vignettes from such well-known television producers as Josh Schwartz and McG, including &quot;Sorority Forever&quot;, &quot;Pushed&quot;, &quot;Rockville, CA&quot;, &quot;The Lake&quot;, and &quot;Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot; (the latter&#x27;s popularity was sustained enough to receive a run and eventual move to cable television as a regular series on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim block). Each of these 10-episode programs ran for five minutes.

Many other well-known Warner Bros.-produced series that did not air on The WB, including &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;The O.C.&quot;, were also made available on the site. However, the website did not include episodes of two of The WB&#x27;s most popular shows, &quot;Charmed&quot; and &quot;Felicity&quot;, as the distribution rights to &quot;Charmed&quot; are owned by CBS Television Distribution and &quot;Felicity&quot;″s rights are owned by Disney-ABC Domestic Television. Comcast offers over 1,000 episodes from the Warner Bros. Television library on its video on demand service. While Warner Bros. Entertainment did not promote the site in any multimedia ads, it had drawn about 250,000 unique viewers a month, according to Mindshare&#x27;s Mr. Chapman, who had been tracking the site. Some of its original material had been offered on partner sites such as MySpace and Facebook. Data compiled by &quot;comScore Video Metrix&quot; showed that 62% of visitors to the site were female.

The McG-produced original series &quot;Sorority Forever&quot; premiered on the site on September 8, 2008. By 2012, it had accrued more than 7.3 million views from TheWB.com and partner sites. An original reality series, &quot;Rich Girl, Poor Girl&quot; from &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; and &quot;Newport Harbor&quot; executive producer Gary Auerbach, in which two teenagers from different economic and social backgrounds swap lives (similar in format to &quot;Wife Swap&quot; and &quot;A Walk in Your Shoes&quot;), had ranked among the top 100 programs in the teenage category on iTunes since its October 20, 2008, debut. With the full replacement of the CW&#x27;s original Internet programming efforts with their CW Seed portal, The WB website was shut down in December 2013. The closure of The WB website ended, after more than eighteen years, the usage of the brand name &quot;The WB&quot;. However, the legacy of The WB still lives on as of 2019. Various programs that aired on the network air reruns on various cable networks such as MTV2 and TNT. Also, WMJF, a small student-run television station at Towson University just outside Baltimore, Maryland, still uses the same call letters (WMJF – Michigan J. Frog) from when the station was a WB affiliate. A neon likeness of Michigan J. Frog also adorns the façade of former WB affiliate WBNX-TV&#x27;s studio complex in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Similarly, a large marquee sign of the network&#x27;s logo that was used in the network&#x27;s &quot;backlot&quot;-themed idents, promos, and bumpers is still located near storage facilities at the Warner Bros. Ranch Facilities in California, where the network was originally operated.

The clothing retailer H&amp;M, not a traditional television advertiser in the United States, sponsored &quot;Sorority Forever&quot; and had some of its clothing worn by characters in the series. Unilever&#x27;s Axe brand has sponsored &quot;Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot;. Warner Horizon Television executive vice president Craig Erwich, who oversaw TheWB.com, said in regards to these tie-ins &quot;If an advertiser has an interest in a series we have in production, we can work in their products or even adjust our launch dates if they want to tie it in to a special promotion.&quot;

==Programming==

Much, though not all, of The WB&#x27;s programming during its eleven-year run as a television network was produced by corporate cousin Warner Bros. Television. The network&#x27;s schedule during its first two seasons – the 1995 midseason (when it inaugurated its initial Wednesday lineup) and the first half of the 1995–96 season (when the network expanded its programming to Sundays) – consisted entirely of sitcoms; the first drama series to debut on the network was the primetime soap &quot;Savannah&quot;, which debuted in February 1996 and ran for two seasons until its cancellation in February 1997. The WB&#x27;s first reality series was the U.S. adaptation of &quot;Popstars&quot;, which ran for two seasons from 2001 to 2003.

In addition to live-action programs, the network has experimented with primetime animated series; &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; was the first such series, airing as part of the network&#x27;s Sunday lineup from September 1995 to July 1996, before moving exclusively to the Kids&#x27; WB Saturday lineup due to low ratings in its prime time slot. Most of the animated projects that aired afterward were adult animation series; the last such attempts being &quot;The Oblongs&quot; (running for one season in 2001, and was later revived on corporate sister Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim block) and &quot;The PJs&quot; (which moved to the network in 2000 following its cancellation by Fox, and ran for only one additional season on The WB).

The WB also occasionally aired regularly scheduled repeat episodes of first-run series airing on other nights throughout the television season intermittently throughout its history; &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; was the first WB series to receive this treatment, with repeats of the sitcom&#x27;s first two seasons (which originally aired on ABC) from August 1995 to August 1996, in addition to the first-run episodes it aired on Wednesday nights (this marked the first time that a network aired reruns as part of its regular schedule – outside of the summer months – since December 1993, when NBC removed repeats of &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; from its daytime lineup two years after that program&#x27;s cancellation). From 1998 to 2000, the network also aired episode repeats from the first two seasons of &quot;7th Heaven&quot; during the first hour of its Sunday lineup under the title &quot;7th Heaven Beginnings&quot;; this concept was revived during the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons with &quot;Smallville&quot; and &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot; (which aired repeats from their early seasons under the respective titles &quot;Smallville: Beginnings&quot; and &quot;Gilmore Girls: Beginnings&quot;). Furthermore, from September 2002 until The WB ceased operations, the network ran a two-hour extension of its Sunday lineup (from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time), known as &quot;EasyView&quot;, a block featuring week-behind episode rebroadcasts of select shows from the network&#x27;s primetime schedule.

Out of all the network&#x27;s series, &quot;7th Heaven&quot; – which by the time it ended, had become the longest-running family drama in television history – was the longest-running series ever to have aired on The WB, having run on the network for ten seasons from 1996 to 2006. The program was beaten by &quot;Supernatural&quot; as the longest-running series to originate on The WB in the 2017–18 season, when the latter series began its thirteenth season (&quot;7th Heaven&quot; ran for an additional season on The CW from 2006 to 2007; while &quot;Supernatural&quot; aired on The WB for one season from 2005 to 2006, before moving to The CW in September 2006, ending in 2020).

===Children&#x27;s programming===

The WB debuted the Kids&#x27; WB children&#x27;s program block in September 1995; the lineup initially featured a mix of Warner Bros.&#x27; most popular children&#x27;s shows (such as &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, and later &quot;&quot;, all of which originated either on Fox Kids or in syndication) and newer series (such as &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;, &quot;Histeria!&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Road Rovers&quot;, &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, and &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;). After the Turner Broadcasting System was acquired by Time Warner in 1996, Kids&#x27; WB formed an alliance with Cartoon Network, resulting over time in an increasing number of programs being shared between the block and the cable channel.

In February 1999, Kids&#x27; WB began airing the American English dub of &quot;Pokémon&quot;. The WB acquired the U.S. rights to the Japanese animated series from TV Tokyo earlier that year (from its U.S. premiere in the fall of 1998 up to that point, the show was syndicated); the series ultimately became a widespread pop culture phenomenon with the added exposure on the network. Kids&#x27; WB also acquired the English-language dub of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, which also saw the type of viewer popularity experienced by &quot;Pokémon&quot;. Between 2000 and 2005, Kids&#x27; WB experimented with some live-action programming, though the block continued to mainly run animated series. A television series adaptation of R. L. Stine&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Room&quot; debuted on the block in 2001; it was cancelled after one season. It also aired the live-action made-for-TV movie &quot;Zolar&quot;, as well as the JammX Kids All-Star dance specials.
With Cartoon Network outrating Fox Kids, and The WB sharing more of its children&#x27;s programming with the cable channel, The WB announced on May 31, 2005, that it would discontinue Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s weekday afternoon block as it became financially unattractive due to broadcast stations shifting their afternoon target audiences more exclusively to adults by filling the slot with talk shows and sitcom reruns, on the basis that children&#x27;s viewing options in that time period had gravitated more towards cable television. Kids&#x27; WB&#x27;s weekday programming continued, but with redundant programs and theme weeks until December 30, 2005 (the block began to increasingly promote Cartoon Network&#x27;s afternoon Miguzi block and the Kids&#x27; WB Saturday morning lineup during the transition). The weekday block was replaced on January 2, 2006, by &quot;Daytime WB,&quot; a block that featured repeats of sitcoms and drama series formerly aired by The WB and other networks (such as &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;, and &quot;What I Like About You&quot;); five days later on January 7, the Kids&#x27; WB Saturday morning lineup was expanded by one hour.

The Daytime WB block continued on The CW, unofficially renamed The CW Daytime (though occasional on-air promos for the block did not refer to this name, the block was discontinued in 2021 when The CW dropped the weekday 3 PM hour in favor of a Saturday primetime night); The CW also kept the Kids&#x27; WB name for the network&#x27;s Saturday morning children&#x27;s programming. However, on October 2, 2007, The CW announced that it would discontinue the Kids&#x27; WB block, due to competition with youth-oriented cable channels. Kids&#x27; WB aired for the last time on May 17, 2008, replaced with a new block programmed in conjunction with 4Kids Entertainment called The CW4Kids (which was replaced by Vortexx on August 25, 2012, after Saban Brands and Kidsco Media Ventures took over programming the block as part of its acquisition of much of 4Kids&#x27;s program library; Vortexx continued to run until September 27, 2014, before being replaced a week later by One Magnificent Morning programmed by Litton Entertainment). As a result of its distribution deal with The CW, 4Kids produced Saturday morning blocks for two networks during the 2008–09 season, as it already programmed Fox&#x27;s 4Kids TV block (which was discontinued by that network on December 27, 2008).

Like its parent network, Kids&#x27; WB was revived as an online-only network in April 2008. In addition to carrying select previous Kids&#x27; WB programs, the site also featured other archived programs to which Time Warner owned or held distribution rights, and programs seen on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. The Kids&#x27; WB website was shut down on May 17, 2015, when it was split into three sites: DCKids.com, LooneyTunes.com, and ScoobyDoo.com; the latter two were regrouped into WB Kids Go in July 2016.

==Differences between The WB and the &quot;Big Four&quot; networks==

===Scheduling===
At the time of its shutdown, The WB ran only two hours of primetime network programming on Monday through Fridays and five hours on Sundays, compared to the three Monday through Saturday and four Sunday primetime hours offered by the Big Three networks (unlike The WB, UPN never carried any weekend primetime programming, though it did offer a movie package to its affiliates on weekend afternoons until September 2000, when the latter was replaced with a two-hour repeat block of UPN programs). This primetime scheduling allowed for many of the network&#x27;s affiliates to air local newscasts during the 10:00–11:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific) time period.

The WB never ran network programming on Saturday nights – despite the fact that the network maintained a children&#x27;s program block on Saturday mornings – allowing affiliates to run syndicated programs, sports, movies or network programs that were preempted from earlier in the week due to special programming, in the 8:00–10:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific) time period. The network&#x27;s Sunday schedule was originally three hours when The WB began programming that night in September 1995, but expanded to five hours (from 5:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time) in September 2002, with the creation of the &quot;EasyView&quot; repeat block (that block was retained by The CW, which initially adopted The WB&#x27;s scheduling model until it turned Sunday programming over to its affiliates in September 2009).

In comparison to ABC and CBS, The WB also had the fewest hours devoted to daytime programming on weekdays between September 2001 (when the network dropped the weekday morning block of Kids&#x27; WB programs) and September 2006, running only two hours of programming each weekday afternoon (compared to 4½ hours on CBS and four hours on ABC) – NBC in comparison ran only three hours of daytime programming each weekday (not counting its morning news program &quot;Today&quot;) until September 2000, when it scaled back its daytime programming block to two hours. Because of these reasons, the schedules of The WB&#x27;s affiliates were largely composed of syndicated programming.

===Affiliate distribution===
The WB was the only English language broadcast network that historically did not have any owned-and-operated stations. Although Tribune Broadcasting maintained an ownership stake in The WB, its stations in the three largest television markets of New York City (WPIX), Los Angeles (KTLA) and Chicago (WGN-TV) were affiliates of the network since Tribune did not have a controlling ownership interest in the network to allow its stations to be constituted as O&amp;Os (by 2005, Tribune owned 22.5% of the network, while Time Warner held the controlling 77.5% interest). Time Warner did not have a station group of its own at the time (and still does not in the present day); although its Turner Broadcasting System division did own Atlanta independent station WPCH-TV (then WTBS, the local feed of then-superstation TBS) at the time, but it never carried WB programming due to the network&#x27;s affiliation with WATL, which Tribune Broadcasting had owned from 1999 (when it acquired the station from Qwest Broadcasting, which was part-owned by Tribune) to 2006 (when it sold the station to the Gannett Company, now Tegna, Inc.).

Unlike the other major networks, The WB distributed its programming in markets that did not have enough commercial television stations to support a standalone WB affiliate to cable-only outlets: the superstation feed of WGN-TV (now known as NewsNation and since converted into a general news cable channel) carried the network&#x27;s programming from January 1995 to October 1999 to make The WB available primarily to areas where it did not yet have a full-time affiliate. While viewers in the Chicago area saw primetime and Kids&#x27; WB programming on separate stations until September 2004 (primetime shows on WGN-TV and children&#x27;s programs on WCIU-TV), the WGN superstation feed carried the WB&#x27;s entire schedule during the four-year period that it carried the network.

On September 21, 1998, The WB launched The WB 100+ Station Group, an alternate national feed for small and certain mid-sized U.S. markets (generally those within the bottom 110 Nielsen media markets). The service – which transmitted its content via an IBM-developed data server network that digitally transmitted local and national advertisements, promos, station identifications and customized logo bugs to each individual affiliate, with the programming feeds and accompanying data being relayed via satellite and stored to a wireless PC-based system (known as a &quot;station in a box&quot;) – was primarily affiliated with cable-only television channels (which were mainly operated by area cable providers), though it was also carried on full-power or low-power stations in some markets. The WB 100+ offered its own master schedule with programs available on the syndication market that were acquired by The WB (including some feature films and infomercials) airing outside of network programming hours; the addition of local advertisements and newscasts were at the discretion of the local distributor. Most of the stations that were part of The WB 100+ Station Group joined The CW Plus after The CW&#x27;s September 2006 launch, though most of the cable-only affiliates that became part of The CW Plus have since been replaced by or converted into digital subchannels carried by major network affiliates.

Of the network&#x27;s cable-exclusive affiliates, &quot;WRWB&quot; in Rochester, New York (owned by local cable provider Greater Rochester Cablevision and its operator/successor, WB sister company Time Warner Cable), TVW (Television Wisconsin Network) in Madison, Wisconsin (owned by Morgan Murphy Media, owner of local CBS affiliate WISC-TV) and WT05 in Toledo, Ohio (owned by Block Communications, operator of Toledo-area cable provider Buckeye CableSystem) were not part of The WB 100+ Station Group, having all predated that service&#x27;s launch. Like the national cable feed, their respective owners handled programming for the three channels, running their own schedule of syndicated programs during non-network hours; this model was maintained by TVW and WT05 under their subsequent affiliations: TVW became a UPN affiliate in 2001 (having been added to a subchannel of WISC the year prior) and a MyNetworkTV affiliate in 2006, while WT05 operated as a CW affiliate from 2006 until its shutdown and replacement by WTVG-DT2 in October 2014. (&quot;WRWB&quot; moved to a subchannel of ABC affiliate WHAM-TV in November 2006, shortly after becoming a CW affiliate.) In certain mid-sized and smaller markets, some of The WB&#x27;s stations held dual affiliations with another major network – most commonly, UPN (with The WB often serving as the primary affiliation) – if there were not enough television stations to allow both networks to maintain separate affiliates (though this was also the case in a few markets where enough stations were available for a standalone affiliate).

===News programming===
News programming on The WB&#x27;s affiliates was similar to Fox stations at the time in that the quantity of newscasts varied from station to station. Roughly half of The WB&#x27;s approximately 200 affiliates aired a local newscast in the 10:00–11:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific (9:00–10:00 p.m. Central/Mountain) time slot at some point during or throughout their affiliations with the network. Fundamentally, the newscast schedules on WB affiliates varied considerably between stations compared to those affiliated with ABC, CBS, NBC and especially Fox. Most WB affiliates generally ran a two-hour morning newscast on weekdays and/or a half-hour or hour-long 10:00 p.m. newscast on Monday through Fridays only or all seven nights of the week; although there were a few larger market stations that maintained in-house news departments that also produced midday newscasts and had morning newscasts that began in the then-traditional 5:00–7:00 a.m. timeslot; early evening newscasts were largely absent on most of these stations.

The WB affiliate body had fewer news-producing stations in comparison to stations aligned with the Big Three television networks (NBC, ABC and CBS) and considerably fewer than Fox (which has only around 70 stations with in-house news departments, with most of its stations outsourcing their news programming to a competitor). When the network launched in January 1995, The WB automatically gained five affiliates with functioning news departments through the initial agreement with Tribune Broadcasting, all of whom founded their news operations as either independent stations or during early affiliations with other networks, such as the DuMont Television Network: WGN-TV in Chicago, WPIX in New York City, KTLA in Los Angeles, KWGN-TV in Denver and WLVI-TV in Boston (a fifth news-producing station owned by Tribune at the time, WGNX in Atlanta, was to become a WB charter affiliate but instead affiliated with CBS after WAGA-TV dropped that network to join Fox in December 1994, through a groupwide affiliation deal between Fox and WAGA owner New World Communications). KPLR-TV in St. Louis (which would not be acquired by Tribune until 2003, when it bought the station from ACME Communications) also continued to produce a 9:00 p.m. newscast as a WB affiliate; while Phoenix, Arizona&#x27;s KTVK began running expanded newscasts shortly before joining The WB at the network&#x27;s launch (it had earlier lost the ABC affiliation to KNXV-TV; The WB affiliation moved to KASW, which KTVK began managing under a local marketing agreement upon its sign-on, in September 1995).

In the late 1990s, Tribune asked the company&#x27;s remaining WB-affiliated stations that did not run newscasts to develop their own news departments; the only stations to do this were KDAF in Dallas–Fort Worth, KHWB in Houston, KSWB-TV in San Diego and WPHL-TV in Philadelphia – the first three debuted their newscasts in 1999, while WPHL had debuted a 10:00 p.m. newscast that was produced in conjunction with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; in 1994, before WPHL took over production of the program in 1996. KSWB and WPHL would both shutter their news departments in 2005, outsourcing production of their 10:00 p.m. newscasts to NBC owned-and-operated stations in their respective markets (KSWB restored in-house newscasts after it switched from WB successor The CW to Fox in August 2008). KNTV in San Jose became the largest news-producing WB affiliate by market size to be owned by a company other than Tribune (and the only other affiliate of the network to produce early evening newscasts, after KTVK) after it terminated its ABC affiliation, and began carrying WB programming (in a partial simulcast with then-sister station KBWB-TV) in 2000, before affiliating with – and then ultimately being purchased by – NBC in 2002.

Sinclair Broadcast Group also operated several WB affiliates with local news departments: Raleigh&#x27;s WLFL was the only WB affiliate that the company owned which had an existing news operation at the time it joined the network (WLFL began producing a 10:00 p.m. newscast as a Fox affiliate in 1992, six years before it joined The WB); Sinclair&#x27;s Tampa, Buffalo, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Norfolk WB affiliates began producing their own newscasts through Sinclair&#x27;s local/national hybrid news format News Central in the early 2000s. The news departments of all seven of those stations were shut down in 2006 due to companywide cutbacks in Sinclair&#x27;s news operations and the discontinuance of News Central. Of the former WB affiliates that produced newscasts during their affiliation with the network, only WGN-TV, WPIX, KTLA, KDAF and KIAH (all of whom became affiliates of The CW) continue to maintain self-supporting news departments (KPLR and KWGN respectively merged their news departments with those of Fox affiliates KTVI and KDVR through a 2008 management agreement between Tribune and Local TV, while WLVI&#x27;s news department was shut down after Tribune sold the station to Sunbeam Television in 2006, with production of its 10:00 p.m. newscast taken over by new sister station WHDH).

In most markets, the local WB affiliate either outsourced news programming to an NBC, ABC or CBS station in the market (either due to insufficient funds for production of their own newscasts or in later years after the FCC permitted duopolies in markets with at least eight unique station owners in 2000, the station being operated through a legal duopoly or operational agreement with a major network affiliate) or opted to carry syndicated programming in the hour following The WB&#x27;s primetime programming. As with Fox affiliates, WB-affiliated stations whose newscasts were produced by a same-market competitor tended to have fewer programming hours devoted to news than the station producing the broadcasts.

==Affiliates==

In 2005, The WB had an estimated audience reach of 91.66% of all U.S. households (equivalent to 90,282,480 households with at least one television set); the network was carried by 177 VHF and UHF stations in the United States. The WB was also available in Canada on cable and satellite providers through affiliates that are located within proximity to the Canada–US border (whose broadcasts of WB shows were subject to simultaneous substitution rules imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to protect program rights held by a domestically based network), and through two affiliates owned by Tribune Broadcasting (WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles) that are classified in that country as superstations, as well as the superstation feed of Chicago affiliate WGN-TV.

===Station standardization===
When The WB launched in 1995, the network began branding most of its affiliates with a combination of &quot;WB&quot; or &quot;The WB,&quot; and the station&#x27;s channel number. This meant that, for example, New York City affiliate WPIX and St. Louis affiliate KPLR-TV were both referred to as &quot;The WB11&quot; and &quot;WB11&quot; respectively (though WPIX branded as &quot;The WB, Channel 11&quot; until 1996, and KPLR as its pre-affiliation brand &quot;St. Louis 11&quot; until 1998). Fox originated such naming schemes, and CBS uses similar on-air branding for most of its owned-and-operated stations (NBC and ABC also utilize similar, but less extreme, naming schemes). While Fox and UPN mandated their respective branding schemes on all of their stations, The WB did not. Therefore, other WB affiliates opted to use non-standardized brandings: WGN-TV in Chicago branded as &quot;WGN Channel 9&quot; (or simply &quot;WGN&quot;) with The WB&#x27;s logo placed within the right curve of the station&#x27;s &quot;9 as an upside-down G&quot; logo after the network launched, and next to a boxed &quot;9&quot; from 2002 to 2006.

Most of the Tribune Company&#x27;s WB affiliates only used the network&#x27;s logo within the logos of each station or used the &quot;WB&quot; name after the callsign in its on-air branding (an example was Los Angeles affiliate KTLA, which branded as &quot;KTLA, The WB&quot;, after dropping its longstanding and genericized &quot;Channel 5&quot; brand in 1997). Many WB affiliates used another form of standardized branding: the network&#x27;s Lakeland, Florida, affiliate (serving Tampa) acquired the WWWB call letters and branded on-air as &quot;The WB 32&quot; (it is now known as WMOR-TV). Other stations would take on a &#x27;by city&#x27; branding approach (for example, KHWB in Houston was called &quot;Houston&#x27;s WB&quot; and WLVI-TV in Boston was called &quot;Boston&#x27;s WB&quot; – both used the &quot;WB (channel number)&quot; branding prior to incorporating the station&#x27;s city of primary service during the final years of the network&#x27;s run); some stations which followed this scheme used a regional name instead of a specific city (such as &quot;Capital Region&#x27;s WB&quot; for WEWB in Albany, New York, or &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s WB&quot; for KFVE in Honolulu, Hawaii), while others also incorporated the channel number (such as Philadelphia affiliate WPHL-TV as &quot;Philadelphia&#x27;s WB17&quot;, or Mobile, Alabama, affiliate WBPG as &quot;The Gulf Coast&#x27;s WB55&quot;). Many stations affiliated with The WB 100+ Station Group also followed either one of these variations on &quot;The City/Region&#x27;s WB&quot; scheme (though the group&#x27;s cable-only affiliates also used fictional call signs).

<doc id="178242" wikidata="Q2385373" url="?curid=178242" title="De Mol (TV series)">
<text>De Mol (The Mole) is a Belgian reality game show that originally aired from 6 December 1998 to 19 March 2000 and again from 19 January to 16 March 2003 on TV1 with Michiel Devlieger as host. A revival has aired since 1 February 2016 on VIER with Gilles De Coster as host. The show won the famous Rose d&#x27;Or award in 2000. The format has been licensed in 40 countries from all around the world.

Players in &quot;The Mole&quot; must work together to complete various physical and mental challenges to build up a significant prize for the winner. One of them, however, is &quot;the Mole&quot;, a double agent hired by the producers to sabotage the efforts of the group. The Mole must be careful to avoid drawing too much suspicion to themself. Using journals, players must track vast amounts of data about the person(s) they suspect of being the Mole, such as seating positions, clothing colours, minor discussion topics, and so on. The quiz at the end of each episode tests players&#x27; knowledge of the Mole, and determines by lowest score (or slowest time, in the event of a tie) who is eliminated from the game.

==Format==
Each series of &quot;The Mole&quot; involves a group of contestants. During each episode, the contestants participate in a number of challenges, each assigned a monetary value. However, one of these contestants has been selected by production to be the Mole; it&#x27;s their job to try to prevent the other players from winning challenges without revealing themself to others. The Mole is told what challenges to expect, but not always how to sabotage them; they must decide whether to intervene and how they do so.

To eliminate someone, all contestants take a quiz (which consists of 20 questions) at the end of every episode regarding the identity of the Mole and their involvement in the previous activities. The player who scores the lowest on this quiz, or was slowest to answer in case of a tie, is eliminated from the game. When there are only three players remaining, including the Mole, the winner of the game is the one that answers the most questions correctly on the final quiz. The final quiz is usually 30 questions.

While success in the challenges builds up potential winnings, it is also critical to stay in the game by scoring better than opponents on the quiz, usually by attempting to draw their suspicions of the Mole&#x27;s identity toward oneself. Since the Mole must use subterfuge to misdirect attention from their attempts to derail the team, disingenuous attempts to emulate the Mole must be subtle, while still noticeable and suspicious. 

Each season may also offer various advantages such as safety/exemption from elimination (&quot;vrijstelling&quot;) or tokens which increase a player&#x27;s score on the quiz (&quot;pasvragen&quot;). Earning or claiming these usually come at the cost of money from the group pot.

<text>Muse are an English rock band from Teignmouth, Devon, formed in 1994. The band consists of Matt Bellamy (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Chris Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion).

Muse released their debut album, &quot;Showbiz&quot;, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy&#x27;s falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001), incorporated wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. &quot;Absolution&quot; (2003) saw further classical influence, with strings on tracks such as &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;, and was the first of seven consecutive UK number-one albums.

&quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, displayed in singles such as &quot;Supermassive Black Hole&quot;, and brought Muse wider international success. &quot;The Resistance&quot; (2009) and &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world&#x27;s major stadium acts. Topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their seventh album, &quot;Drones&quot; (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, &quot;Simulation Theory&quot; (2018), prominently featured synthesisers and was influenced by science fiction and the simulation hypothesis. Their ninth album, &quot;Will of the People&quot; (2022), which combined many genres and themes from their previous albums, was released in August 2022.

Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, two Brit Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012, they received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. , they had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.

==History==

=== 1994–1997: Early years ===
The members of Muse played in separate school bands during their time at Teignmouth Community College in the early 1990s. Guitarist Matt Bellamy successfully auditioned for drummer Dominic Howard&#x27;s band, Carnage Mayhem, becoming its singer and songwriter. They renamed the band Gothic Plague. They asked Chris Wolstenholme – at that time the drummer for Fixed Penalty – to join as bassist; he agreed and took up bass lessons. The band was renamed Rocket Baby Dolls and adopted a goth-glam image. Around this time, they received a £150 grant from the Prince&#x27;s Trust for equipment.

In 1994, Rocket Baby Dolls won a local battle of the bands, smashing their equipment in the process. Bellamy said, &quot;It was supposed to be a protest, a statement, so, when we actually won, it was a real shock, a massive shock. After that, we started taking ourselves seriously.&quot; The band quit their jobs, changed their name to Muse, and moved away from Teignmouth. The band liked that the new name was short and thought that it looked good on a poster. According to journalist Mark Beaumont, the band wanted the name to reflect &quot;the sense Matt had that he had somehow &#x27;summoned up&#x27; this band, the way mediums could summon up inspirational spirits at times of emotional need&quot;.

=== 1998–2000: First EPs and &quot;Showbiz&quot; ===
After a few years building a fanbase, Muse played their first gigs in London and Manchester supporting Skunk Anansie on tour. They had a significant meeting with Dennis Smith, the owner of Sawmills Studio, situated in a converted water mill in Cornwall. He had seen the three boys grow up as he knew their parents, and had a production company with their future manager Safta Jaffery, with whom he had recently started the record label Taste Media. The meeting led to their first serious recordings and the release of the &quot;Muse&quot; EP on 11 May 1998 on Sawmills&#x27; in-house Dangerous label, produced by Paul Reeve. Their second EP, the &quot;Muscle Museum EP&quot;, also produced by Reeve, was released on 11 January 1999. It reached number 3 in the indie singles chart and attracted the attention of the radio broadcaster Steve Lamacq and the magazine &quot;NME&quot;.

Later in 1999, Muse performed on the Emerging Artist&#x27;s stage at Woodstock &#x27;99 and signed with Smith and Jaffery. Despite the success of their second EP, British record companies were reluctant to sign Muse. After a trip to New York&#x27;s CMJ Festival, Nanci Walker, then Sr. Director of A&amp;R at Columbia Records, flew Muse to the US to showcase for Columbia Records&#x27; then-Senior Vice-president of A&amp;R, Tim Devine, as well as for American Recording&#x27;s Rick Rubin. During this trip, on 24 December 1998, Muse signed a deal with American record label Maverick Records. Upon their return to England, Taste Media arranged deals for Muse with various record labels in Europe and Australia, allowing them control over their career in individual countries. John Leckie was brought in alongside Reeve to produce the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Showbiz&quot; (1999). The album showcased Muse&#x27;s aggressive yet melancholic musical style, with lyrics about relationships and their difficulties trying to establish themselves in their hometown.

=== 2000–2002: &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; ===
During the production of their second album, &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001), Muse experimented with instrumentation such as a church organ, Mellotron, animal bones, and an expanded drum kit. There was more of Bellamy&#x27;s falsetto, arpeggiated guitar, and piano playing. Bellamy cites guitar influences such as Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine), the latter evident in the more riff-based songs in &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; and in Bellamy&#x27;s use of guitar pitch-shifting effects. The album features a cover of Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse&#x27;s &quot;Feeling Good&quot;, voted in various polls one of the greatest cover versions of all time. It was released as a double A-side single, &quot;Hyper Music/Feeling Good&quot;.

&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; received positive reviews. &quot;NME&quot; gave it 9/10 and wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s amazing for such a young band to load up with a heritage that includes the darker visions of Cobain and Kafka, Mahler and the Tiger Lillies, Cronenberg and Schoenberg, and make a sexy, populist album.&quot; Maverick, Muse&#x27;s American label, did not consider Bellamy&#x27;s vocals &quot;radio-friendly&quot; and asked Muse to rerecord &quot;Plug in Baby&quot; for the US release. Muse refused and left Maverick. &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; was not released in the US until September 2005, after Muse signed to Warner Bros.

&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; has made appearances on lists of the greatest rock albums of the 2000s, both poll-based and on publication lists. In 2006, it placed at number 74 on &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All-Time, while in February 2008, the album placed at number 28 on a list of the Best British Albums of All Time determined by the magazine&#x27;s readers. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; placed the album at number 20 in its 100 Best British Rock Albums Ever! List and at number 13 on its 50 Best Albums of the 21st Century list.

On 10 November 2001 the band appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot; and performed &quot;Hyper Music&quot; and &quot;Feeling Good&quot;.

In 2002, Muse released the first live DVD, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, featuring footage recorded during Muse&#x27;s two gigs at Le Zenith in Paris in 2001, and a documentary film of the band on tour. A double album, &quot;Hullabaloo Soundtrack&quot;, was released at the same time, containing a compilation of B-sides and a disc of recordings of songs from the Le Zenith performances. A double-A side single was also released featuring the new songs &quot;In Your World&quot; and &quot;Dead Star&quot;.

In 2002, Muse threatened Celine Dion with legal action when she planned to name her Las Vegas show &quot;Muse&quot;, as Muse had worldwide performing rights to the name. Muse refused an offer from Dion of $50,000 for the rights, as they feared it could harm their chances of breaking into the US market. Bellamy said: &quot;We don&#x27;t want to turn up there with people thinking we&#x27;re Celine Dion&#x27;s backing band.&quot;

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Absolution&quot; ===

Muse&#x27;s third album, &quot;Absolution&quot;, produced by Rich Costey, Paul Reeve and John Cornfield was released on 15 September 2003. It debuted at number one in the UK and produced Muse&#x27;s first top-ten hit, &quot;Time Is Running Out&quot;, and three top-twenty hits: &quot;Hysteria&quot;, &quot;Sing for Absolution&quot; and &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;. &quot;Absolution&quot; was eventually certified gold in the US. Muse undertook a year-long international tour in support of the album, visiting Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, and France. On the 2004 US leg of the tour, Bellamy injured himself onstage during the opening show in Atlanta; the tour resumed after Bellamy received stitches.

In June 2004, Muse headlined the Glastonbury Festival, which they later described as &quot;the best gig of our lives&quot;. Howard&#x27;s father, William Howard, who attended the festival to watch the band, died from a heart attack shortly after the performance. Bellamy said: &quot;It was the biggest feeling of achievement we&#x27;ve ever had after coming offstage. It was almost surreal that an hour later his dad died. It was almost not believable. We spent about a week sort of just with Dom trying to support him. I think he was happy that at least his dad got to see him at probably what was the finest moment so far of the band&#x27;s life.&quot;

Muse won two MTV Europe awards, including &quot;Best Alternative Act&quot;, and a Q Award for &quot;Best Live Act&quot;, and received an award for &quot;Best British Live Act&quot; at the Brit Awards. On 2 July 2005, they participated in the Live 8 concert in Paris. In 2003, the band successfully sued Nestlé for using their cover &quot;Feeling Good&quot; for a Nescafé advertisement without permission and donated the money won from the lawsuit to Oxfam. An unofficial DVD biography, &quot;Manic Depression&quot;, was released in April 2005.

Muse released another live DVD on 12 December 2005, &quot;Absolution Tour&quot;, containing edited and remastered highlights from their Glastonbury performance unseen footage from their performances at London Earls Court, Wembley Arena, and the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; and &quot;HAARP&quot; ===


In 2006, Muse released their fourth album, &quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot;, co-produced once again with Rich Costey. The album&#x27;s title and themes reflect the band&#x27;s interest in science fiction. The album charted at number one in the UK, much of Europe, and Australia. In the US, it reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Before the release of the new album, Muse made several promotional TV appearances starting on 13 May 2006 at BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend. The Black Holes and Revelations Tour started before the release of their album and initially consisted mostly of festival appearances, including a headline slot at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2006. The band&#x27;s main touring itinerary started with a tour of North America from late July to early August 2006. After the last of the summer festivals, a tour of Europe began, including a large arena tour of the UK. Muse recruited an additional touring member, Morgan Nicholls, on keyboards, percussion and guitar. He performed with them until 2022.

&quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Music Prize, but lost to Arctic Monkeys. It earned a Platinum Europe Award after selling one million copies in Europe. The first single from the album, &quot;Supermassive Black Hole&quot;, was released as a download in May 2006. In August 2006, Muse recorded a live session at Abbey Road Studios for the &quot;Live from Abbey Road&quot; television show. The second single, &quot;Starlight&quot;, was released in September 2006. &quot;Knights of Cydonia&quot; was released in the US as a radio-only single in June 2006 and in the UK in November 2006. The fourth single, &quot;Invincible&quot;, was released in April 2007. Another single, &quot;Map of the Problematique&quot;, was released for download only in June 2007, following the band&#x27;s performance at Wembley Stadium.
Muse spent November and much of December 2006 touring Europe with British band Noisettes as the supporting act. The tour continued in Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia in early 2007 before returning to England for the summer. At the 2007 Brit Awards in February, Muse received their second award for Best British Live Act. They became the first act to sell out the newly rebuilt Wembley Stadium when they performed two dates there in June 2007. Both concerts were recorded for a DVD/CD, &quot;HAARP&quot;, released in early 2008. In 2018, &quot;HAARP&quot; was named the 40th-greatest live album of all time by &quot;NME&quot;.

The tour continued across Europe in July 2007 before returning to the US in August, where Muse played to a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden, New York City. They headlined the second night of the Austin City Limits Music Festival on 15 September, and performed at the October Vegoose in Las Vegas with bands including Rage Against the Machine, Daft Punk and Queens of the Stone Age. Muse continued touring in Eastern Europe, Russia, Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand in 2007 before going to South Africa, Portugal, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Ireland, and the UK in 2008. On 12 April, they played a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Muse performed at Rock in Rio Lisboa on 6 June 2008, alongside bands including Kaiser Chiefs, the Offspring and Linkin Park. They also performed in Marlay Park, Dublin, on 13 August. A few days later, Muse headlined the 2008 V Festival, playing in Chelmsford on Saturday 16 August and Staffordshire on Sunday 17 August. On 25 September, Bellamy, Howard and Wolstenholme received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Plymouth for their contributions to music.

=== 2009–2011: &quot;The Resistance&quot; ===

During the recording of Muse&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The Resistance&quot;, Wolstenholme checked into rehab to deal with his alcoholism, which was threatening the band&#x27;s future. Howard said: &quot;I&#x27;ve always believed in band integrity and sticking together. There&#x27;s something about the fact we all grew up together. We&#x27;ve been together for 18 years now, which is over half our lives.&quot;

&quot;The Resistance&quot; was released in September 2009, the first album produced by Muse, with engineering by Adrian Bushby and mixing by Mark Stent. It topped album charts in 19 countries, became the band&#x27;s third number one album in the UK, and reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Reviews were mostly positive, with praise for its ambition, classical influences and the three-part &quot;&quot;. &quot;The Resistance&quot; beat its predecessor &quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; in album sales in its debut week in the UK with approximately 148,000 copies sold. The first single, &quot;Uprising&quot;, was released seven days earlier. On 13 September, Muse performed &quot;Uprising&quot; at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City.

The Resistance Tour began with A Seaside Rendezvous in Muse&#x27;s hometown of Teignmouth, Devon, in September 2009. It included headline slots the following year at festivals including Coachella, Glastonbury, Oxegen, Hovefestivalen, T in the Park, Austin City Limits and the Australian Big Day Out. Between September and November, Muse toured North America.

Muse provided the lead single for the film &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Neutron Star Collision (Love Is Forever)&quot;, released on 17 May 2010. In June, Muse headlined Glastonbury Festival for the second time. After U2 canceled their headline slot following their singer Bono&#x27;s back injury, their guitarist, the Edge, joined Muse to play the U2 track &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;.

For their live performances, Muse received the O2 Silver Clef Award in London on 2 July 2010, presented by Roger Taylor and Brian May of Queen. Taylor described the trio as &quot;probably the greatest live act in the world today&quot;. On 12 September 2010, Muse won an MTV Video Music Award in the category of Best Special Effects, for the &quot;Uprising&quot; video. On 21 November, Muse won an American Music Award for Favorite Artist in the Alternative Rock Music Category. On 2 December, Muse were nominated for three awards for the 53rd Grammy Awards on 13 February 2011, for which they won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album for &quot;The Resistance&quot;.

Based on having the largest airplay and sales in the US, Muse were named the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs and Rock Songs artist for 2010 with &quot;Uprising&quot;, &quot;Resistance&quot; and &quot;Undisclosed Desires&quot; achieving 1st, 6th and 49th places on the year-end Alternative Song chart. On 30 July 2011, Muse supported Rage Against the Machine at their only 2011 gig at the L.A. Rising festival. On 13 August, Muse headlined the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in San Francisco. They headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2011. To celebrate the tenth anniversary of their album &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001), Muse performed all eleven tracks. Muse also headlined Lollapalooza in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park in August 2011.

=== 2012–2013: &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; and &quot;Live at Rome Olympic Stadium&quot; ===

In an April 2012 interview, Bellamy said Muse&#x27;s next album would include influences from acts such as French house duo Justice and UK electronic rock group Does It Offend You, Yeah?. On 6 June 2012, Muse released a trailer for their next album, &quot;The 2nd Law&quot;, with a countdown on the band&#x27;s website. The trailer, which included dubstep elements, was met with mixed reactions. On 7 June, Muse announced a European Arena tour, the first leg of The 2nd Law Tour. The leg included dates in France, Spain and the UK. The first single from the album, &quot;Survival&quot;, was the official song of the London 2012 Summer Olympics, and Muse performed it at the Olympics closing ceremony.
Muse revealed the &quot;2nd Law&quot; tracklist on 13 July 2012. The second single, &quot;Madness&quot;, was released on 20 August 2012, with a music video on 5 September. Muse played at the Roundhouse on 30 September as part of the iTunes Festival. &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; was released worldwide on 1 October, and on 2 October 2012 in the US; it reached number one in the UK Albums Chart, and number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The song &quot;Madness&quot; earned a nomination in the Best Rock Song category and the album itself was nominated for the Best Rock Album at the 55th Grammy Awards, 2013. The band performed the album&#x27;s opening song, &quot;Supremacy&quot;, with an orchestra at the 2013 Brit Awards on 20 February 2013. The album was a nominee for Best Rock Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. The song &quot;Madness&quot; was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The album listed at number 46 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the top 50 albums of 2012, saying &quot;In an era of diminished expectations, Muse make stadium-crushing songs that mix the legacies of Queen, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin and Radiohead while making almost every other current band seem tiny.&quot;

Muse released their fourth live album, &quot;Live at Rome Olympic Stadium&quot;, on 29 November 2013 on CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray formats. In November 2013, the film had theatrical screenings in 20 cities worldwide. The album contains the band&#x27;s performance at Rome&#x27;s Stadio Olimpico on 6 July 2013, in front of over 60,000 people; it was the first concert filmed in 4K format. The concert was a part of the Unsustainable Tour, Muse&#x27;s mid-2013 tour of Europe.

=== 2014–2016: &quot;Drones&quot; ===
Muse began writing their seventh album soon after the Rome concert. The band felt that the electronic side of their music was becoming too dominant, and wanted to return to a simpler rock sound. After self-producing their previous two albums, the band hired producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange so they could focus on performance and spend less time mixing and reviewing takes. Recording took place in the Vancouver Warehouse Studio from October 2014 to April 2015.

Muse announced their seventh album, &quot;Drones&quot;, on 11 March 2015. The following day, they released a lyric video for &quot;Psycho&quot; on their YouTube channel, and made the song available for instant download with the album pre-order. Another single, &quot;Dead Inside&quot;, was released on 23 March.

From 15 March to 16 May, Muse embarked on a short tour in small venues throughout the UK and the US, the Psycho Tour. Live performances of new songs from these concerts are included on the DVD accompanying the album along with bonus studio footage. On 18 May 2015, Muse released a lyric video for &quot;Mercy&quot; on their YouTube channel, and made the song available for instant download with the album pre-order.

&quot;Drones&quot; was released on 8 June 2015. A concept album about the dehumanisation of modern warfare, it returned to a simpler rock sound with less elaborate production and genre experimentation. It topped the album charts in the UK, the US, Australia and most major markets. Muse headlined Lollapalooza Berlin on 13 September 2015. On 15 February 2016, &quot;Drones&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 58th Grammy Awards. On 24 June, Muse headlined the Glastonbury Festival for a third time, becoming the first act to have headlined each day of the festival (Friday, Saturday and Sunday). On 30 November 2016, Muse were announced to headline Reading and Leeds 2017.

=== 2017–2021: &quot;Simulation Theory&quot; and reissues ===

In 2017, Muse toured North America, supported by Thirty Seconds to Mars and PVRIS. On 18 May, they released &quot;Dig Down&quot;, the first single from their eighth album. In November, they performed at the BlizzCon festival. &quot;Thought Contagion&quot;, the second single, was released on 15 February 2018, accompanied by an 1980s-styled music video. In June, Muse opened the Rock In Rio festival. On 24 February, they played a show at La Cigale in France with a setlist voted for fans online, followed by a show at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, London, in which they played mainly older material and B-sides. A concert video, &quot;&quot;, was released in cinemas worldwide on 12 July 2018.
On 19 July 2018, Muse released the third single from their upcoming album, &quot;Something Human&quot;, followed by &quot;The Dark Side&quot; on 30 August and &quot;Pressure&quot; on 27 September. Muse released their eighth studio album, &quot;Simulation Theory&quot;, with a focus on 80s-inspired synthesisers, on 9 November. The Simulation Theory World Tour began in Houston on 3 February 2019 and concluded on 15 October in Lima. A film based on the album and tour, &quot;Muse – Simulation Theory&quot;, combining concert footage and narrative scenes, was released in August 2020.

In December 2019, Muse released &quot;Origin of Muse&quot;, a box set comprising remastered versions of &quot;Showbiz&quot; and &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; plus previously unreleased material. For the 20th anniversary of &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; in June 2021, Muse released a remixed and remastered version, &quot;Origin of Symmetry: XX Anniversary RemiXX&quot;.

=== 2022–present: &quot;Will of the People&quot; ===
On 13 January 2022, Muse released the single &quot;Won&#x27;t Stand Down&quot;, which marked a return to their heavier early sound. On 9 March, Muse posted a 35-second clip across various social media platforms depicting large busts of the band members being torn down. On 17 March, Muse announced their ninth album, &quot;Will of the People&quot;, with a release date of 26 August 2022. Ahead of the release, Muse released the singles &quot;Compliance&quot;, &quot;Will of the People&quot;, &quot;Kill or Be Killed&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Like It&#x27;s Halloween&quot;.

The Will of the People World Tour began in April 2022. The touring member Morgan Nicholls was replaced by Dan Lancaster on additional keys, percussion and guitar. On 17 November 2023, Muse released a 20th-anniversary reissue of &quot;Absolution&quot;, featuring bonus tracks, live recordings and demos. Muse appeared on the song &quot;1685&quot; from the 2024 album &quot;Telos&quot; by the electronic producer Zedd. In August 2024, Wolstenholme announced a solo project, Chromes, and released the singles &quot;Imaginary World&quot; and &quot;The Good Life&quot;.

==Musical style==

Described as a band that fuse alternative rock, progressive rock, space rock, hard rock, art rock, electronic rock, progressive metal, indie rock and pop, Muse also mix sounds from genres such as electronica and R&amp;B, with forms such as classical music and rock opera. In 2002, Bellamy described Muse as a &quot;trashy three-piece&quot;. He said supporting the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their 1999 &quot;Californication&quot; tour inspired Muse to become less reserved and &quot;up their game&quot; in their performances. Bellamy said Lady Gaga was an influence on Muse&#x27;s showmanship and stage costumes, &quot;crossing that line between what is fantasy and what is reality&quot;.

Early in their career, Muse were often likened to Radiohead. &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that Bellamy&#x27;s voice &quot;often slips into high, mournful tones&quot; similar to the Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke. John Leckie, who produced Muse&#x27;s first two albums and also produced Radiohead&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995), dismissed the comparisons, saying: &quot;In the late 90s, any British band that sang passionately and played guitar was going to get compared to Radiohead.&quot; He said he chose to produce Muse after &quot;The Bends&quot; because he &quot;intentionally looked for something different&quot;. Asked in 2009, Bellamy said he did not hear the similarity, saying Muse were &quot;past [the comparisons] in most places&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described Muse&#x27;s music as &quot;firmly ol&#x27; skool at heart: proggy hard rock that forgoes any pretensions to restraint ... their songs use full-stacked guitars and thunderous drums to evoke God&#x27;s footsteps&quot;. AllMusic described their sound as a &quot;fusion of progressive rock, glam, electronica, and Radiohead-influenced experimentation&quot;. On Muse&#x27;s association with progressive rock, Howard said: &quot;I associate [progressive rock] with 10-minute guitar solos, but I guess we kind of come into the category. A lot of bands are quite ambitious with their music, mixing lots of different styles – and when I see that I think it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve noticed that kind of thing becoming a bit more mainstream.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Muse as &quot;fearlessly flamboyant&quot;. Howard said he loved the &quot;excess&quot; of their music and that he liked &quot;pushing it as far as we can&quot;, citing the choir of &quot;Survival&quot; as an example. Wolstenholme said: &quot;You can go on writing traditional pop-rock songs and get stale or try something new. There are risks either way.&quot; The Queen guitarist, Brian May, praised Muse in 2009, calling them &quot;extraordinary musicians&quot; who &quot;let their madness show through, always a good thing in an artist&quot;. 

For their second album, &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001), Muse aimed to craft a &quot;heavier&quot;, more aggressive sound. Their third album, &quot;Absolution&quot; (2003), features prominent string arrangements and drew influences from artists such as Queen. Their fourth album, &quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; (2006) was influenced by artists including Depeche Mode and Lightning Bolt, as well as Asian and European music such as Naples music. The band listened to radio stations from the Middle East during the album&#x27;s recording sessions.

Muse&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; (2012) has a broader range of influences, ranging from funk and film scores to electronica and dubstep. &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; is influenced by rock acts such as Queen and Led Zeppelin (on &quot;Supremacy&quot;) as well as dubstep producer Skrillex and Nero (on &quot;The 2nd Law: Unsustainable&quot; and &quot;Follow Me&quot;, with the latter being co-produced by Nero), Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder (on &quot;Panic Station&quot; which features musicians who performed on Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Superstition&quot;) and Hans Zimmer. The album features two songs with lyrics written and sung by Wolstenholme, who wrote about his battle with alcoholism. It features extensive electronic instrumentation, including Modular synthesisers and the French Connection, a synthesiser controller similar to the ondes martenot.

===Musicianship===
Many Muse songs are recognisable by Bellamy&#x27;s vocal vibrato, falsetto, and melismatic phrasing, influenced by Jeff Buckley. As a pianist, Bellamy often uses arpeggios. Bellamy&#x27;s compositions often suggest or quote late classical and romantic era composers such as Sergei Rachmaninov (in &quot;Space Dementia&quot; and &quot;Butterflies and Hurricanes&quot;), Camille Saint-Saëns (in &quot;I Belong to You (+Mon Cœur S&#x27;ouvre a ta Voix)&quot;) and Frédéric Chopin (in &quot;United States of Eurasia&quot;). As a guitarist, Bellamy often uses arpeggiator and pitch-shift effects to create a more &quot;electronic&quot; sound, citing Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello as influences. His guitar playing is also influenced by Latin and Spanish guitar music; Bellamy said: &quot;I just think that music is really passionate...It has so much feel and flair to it. I’ve spent important times of my life in Spain and Greece, and various deep things happened there – falling in love, stuff like that. So maybe that rubbed off somewhere.&quot;

Wolstenholme&#x27;s basslines provide a motif for many Muse songs; the band combines bass guitar with effects and synthesisers to create overdriven fuzz bass tones. Bellamy and Wolstenholme use touch-screen controllers, often built into their instruments, to control synthesisers and effects including Kaoss Pads and Digitech Whammy pedals.

===Lyrics===
Most earlier Muse songs lyrically dealt with introspective themes, including relationships, social alienation, and difficulties they had encountered while trying to establish themselves in their hometown. However, with the band&#x27;s progress, their song concepts have become more ambitious, addressing issues such as the fear of the evolution of technology in their &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; (2001) album. They deal mainly with the apocalypse in &quot;Absolution&quot; (2003) and with catastrophic war in &quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; (2006). &quot;The Resistance&quot; (2009) focused on themes of government oppression, uprising, love, and panspermia. The album itself was mainly inspired by &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; by George Orwell. Their sixth studio album, &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; (2012), relates to economics, thermodynamics, and apocalyptic themes. Their 2015 album, &quot;Drones&quot;, is a concept album that uses autonomous killing drones as a metaphor for brainwashing and loss of empathy.

Books that have influenced Muse&#x27;s lyrics include &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, &quot;Confessions of an Economic Hitman&quot; by John Perkins, &quot;Hyperspace&quot; by Michio Kaku, &quot;The 12th Planet&quot; by Zecharia Sitchin, &quot;Rule by Secrecy&quot; by Jim Marrs and &quot;Trance Formation of America&quot; by Cathy O&#x27;Brien.

<doc id="178245" wikidata="Q2963436" url="?curid=178245" title="Chie Nakane">
<text>was a Japanese anthropologist and Professor Emerita of Social Anthropology at the University of Tokyo.

==Education and career==
Nakane was born in Tokyo and spent her teenage years in Beijing. She graduated from Tsuda College in 1947 and then completed her graduate work specializing in China and Tibet at the University of Tokyo in 1952. In 1953–1957, she did fieldwork in India and studied in the London School of Economics. Nakane served as visiting professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago at the invitation of Sol Tax from 1959 to 1960 and as Visiting Lecturer in the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London at the invitation of Christoph von Furer-Haimendorf in 1960–1961.

In 1970, Nakane became the first female professor at the University of Tokyo, where she served as Director of the Institute of Oriental Culture from 1980 to 1982. She was also Professor at Osaka University and the National Museum of Ethnology and visiting professor at Cornell University from 1975 to 1980. Nakane retired from the University of Tokyo in 1987. In 1995, she became the first and only female member of the Japan Academy. She was also an honorary member of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

==Japan as Vertical Society==
Nakane&#x27;s work focuses on cross-cultural comparisons of social structures in Asia, notably Japan, India, and China. She is internationally known for her bestselling book, &quot;Japanese Society&quot;, which has been translated into 13 languages. In this book, Nakane characterizes Japan as &quot;a vertical society&quot; where human relations are based on &quot;place&quot; (shared space) instead of &quot;attribute&quot; (qualification).

<doc id="178246" wikidata="Q202148" url="?curid=178246" title="Burt Reynolds">
<text>Burton Leon Reynolds Jr. (February 11, 1936 – September 6, 2018) was an American actor most famous during the 1970s and 1980s. Reynolds first became well known featured in television series such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (1962–1965), &quot;Hawk&quot; (1966) and &quot;Dan August&quot; (1970–1971). He had leading roles in films such as &quot;Navajo Joe&quot; (1966) and &quot;100 Rifles&quot; (1969), and his breakthrough role was as Lewis Medlock in &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1972).

Reynolds played leading roles in a number of subsequent financial successes such as &quot;White Lightning&quot; (1973), &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (1974), &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977) (which started a six-year box-office reign), &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; (1977), &quot;The End&quot; (1978), &quot;Hooper&quot; (1978), &quot;Starting Over&quot; (1979), &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; (1980), &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; (1981), &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982) and &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), several of which he directed. He was nominated twice for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

Reynolds was voted the world&#x27;s number one movie actor from 1978 to 1982 in the annual Top Ten Money Making Stars Poll, a record that he shares with Bing Crosby. After a number of box-office failures, Reynolds returned to television, featuring in the situation comedy &quot;Evening Shade&quot; (1990–1994), which won a Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. His performance as high-minded pornographer Jack Horner in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997) brought him renewed critical attention, earning Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, with nominations for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Early life==
Burton Leon Reynolds Jr. was born on February 11, 1936, to Burton Milo Reynolds Sr. and Harriet Fernette &quot;Fern&quot; (&quot;née&quot; Miller). His family descended from Dutch, English, Scots-Irish and Scottish ancestry. Reynolds also claimed some Cherokee and Italian ancestry.

During his career, Reynolds often claimed to have been born in Waycross, Georgia, although in 2015, he stated that he was actually born in Lansing, Michigan. In his autobiography, he stated that Lansing is where his family lived when his father was drafted into the United States Army.

Reynolds, his mother, and his sister joined his father at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, where they subsequently lived for two years. When his father was sent to Europe, the family relocated to Lake City, Michigan, where his mother had been raised. In 1946, the family relocated to Riviera Beach, Florida, where, in sixth grade, Reynolds began a lifelong close friendship with Dick Howser. Reynolds&#x27;s father eventually became Chief of Police of Riviera Beach, which is adjacent to the north end of West Palm Beach, Florida.

His nickname in Riviera Beach was &quot;Buddy&quot;. (The childhood nicknames of Marlon Brando, the superstar actor whom Reynolds was said to resemble and with whom he feuded, were &quot;Bud&quot; and &quot;Buddy&quot;.)

During 10th grade at Palm Beach High School, Reynolds was named First Team All State and All Southern as a fullback, and received multiple scholarship offers.

===College===
After graduating from Palm Beach High School, he attended Florida State University on a football scholarship and played halfback, starting in 1954. While at Florida State, he roomed with future college-football coach, broadcaster and analyst Lee Corso, and also became a brother of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.

Reynolds had an outstanding freshman year as a football player. However, he injured his knee in the first game of his sophomore season and, later that year, lost his spleen and injured his other knee in a bad car accident. He did not return to the university for almost two years. To keep up with his studies, he enrolled at Palm Beach Junior College (PBJC) in neighboring Lake Park in early 1956. When Reynolds returned to Florida State in 1957, he rejoined the football team, although his leg injured by the car accident slowed him. He was blamed, fairly or not, for the team&#x27;s loss to North Carolina State University on October 12, 1957. Immediately after the game he told his teammates that he was done with football.

===Early acting===
During his term at PBJC in early 1956, Reynolds was in an English class taught by Watson B. Duncan III. Duncan encouraged him to try out for a play he was producing, &quot;Outward Bound&quot;. He cast him in the lead role based on having heard him read Shakespeare in class, resulting in his winning the 1956 Florida State Drama Award for his performance. &quot;I read two words and they gave me a lead,&quot; he later said.

In his autobiography, he referred to Duncan as his mentor and the most influential person of his life.

==Career==

===Theater===
The Florida State Drama Award included a scholarship to the Hyde Park Playhouse, a summer stock theater in Hyde Park, New York. Reynolds considered the opportunity as an agreeable alternative to more physically demanding summer jobs, but did not yet consider acting as a possible career. While working there, Reynolds met Joanne Woodward, who helped him find an agent.

&quot;I don&#x27;t think I ever actually saw him perform,&quot; said Woodward. &quot;I knew him as this cute, shy, attractive boy. He had the kind of lovely personality that made you want to do something for him.&quot;

He was cast in &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. After his Broadway debut in &quot;Look, We&#x27;ve Come Through&quot;, he received favorable reviews for his performance and went on tour with the cast, driving the bus as well as appearing on stage.

After the tour, Reynolds returned to New York and enrolled in acting classes, along with Frank Gifford, Carol Lawrence, Red Buttons and Jan Murray.

&quot;I was a working actor for two years before I finally took my first real acting class (with Wynn Handman at the Neighborhood Playhouse),&quot; he said. &quot;It was a lot of technique, truth, moment-to-moment, how to listen, improv.&quot;

After a botched improvisation in acting class, Reynolds briefly considered returning to Florida, but soon gained a part in a revival of &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, in which Charlton Heston played the starring role.

After the play closed, the director John Forsythe arranged a movie audition with Joshua Logan for Reynolds. The movie was &quot;Sayonara&quot; (1957). Reynolds was told that he could not be in the movie because he looked too much like Marlon Brando. Logan advised Reynolds to go to Hollywood, although Reynolds did not feel confident enough to do so. (Another source says that Reynolds did a screen test after studio talent agent Lew Wasserman saw the effect Reynolds that had on secretaries in his office, but the test was unsuccessful.)

Reynolds worked in a variety of jobs, such as waiting tables, washing dishes, driving a delivery truck, and as a bouncer at the Roseland Ballroom. He wrote that while working as a dockworker, he was offered $150 to jump through a glass window on a live television show.

===Early television and &quot;Riverboat&quot;===
Reynolds began acting for television during the late 1950s, with guest roles on shows like &quot;Flight&quot;, &quot;M Squad&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Lawless Years&quot; and &quot;Pony Express&quot;. He signed a seven-year contract with Universal Studios. &quot;I don&#x27;t care whether he can act or not,&quot; said Wasserman. &quot;Anyone who has this effect on women deserves a break.&quot;

Reynolds&#x27;s first big opportunity came when he was cast alongside Darren McGavin, who was the main actor of the television series &quot;Riverboat&quot; (1959–61), playing Ben Frazer, the boat&#x27;s pilot. According to a contemporary report, Reynolds was considered &quot;a double for Marlon Brando&quot;. The show played for two seasons, but Reynolds quit after only 20 episodes, claiming that he did not get along with McGavin nor the executive producer, and that he had &quot;a stupid part&quot;.

Reynolds subsequently said that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t get a job. I didn&#x27;t have a very good reputation. You just don&#x27;t walk out on a network television series.&quot;

Reynolds returned to guest featuring in television shows. As he put it, &quot;I played heavies in every series in town,&quot; appearing in episodes of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Lock Up&quot;, &quot;The Blue Angels&quot;, &quot;Michael Shayne&quot;, &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;, &quot;The Aquanauts&quot; and &quot;The Brothers Brannagan&quot;. &quot;They were depressing years,&quot; he later said.

Reynolds starred in the low budget film &quot;Angel Baby&quot; (1961). He followed it with a role in a war film &quot;Armored Command&quot; (1961). &quot;It was the one picture that Howard Keel didn&#x27;t sing on,&quot; reminisced Reynolds. &quot;That was a terrible mistake.&quot;

In 1961, he returned to Broadway to appear in &quot;Look, We&#x27;ve Come Through&quot;, directed by José Quintero, but it lasted only five performances.

Reynolds continued to guest-star on episodes of &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;Ripcord&quot;, &quot;Everglades&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;The Bard&quot;, an hour-long send-up of Reynolds&#x27;s look-alike Marlon Brando). He later said, &quot;I learned more about my craft in these guest shots than I did standing around and looking virile on &quot;Riverboat&quot;.&quot;

===&quot;Gunsmoke&quot;===
In 1962, Dennis Weaver wanted to quit the cast of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, one of the top-rated shows in the country. The producers developed a new character, &quot;half-breed&quot; blacksmith Quint Asper. Reynolds was cast, chosen over 300 other contenders. He announced that he would stay on the show &quot;until it ends. I think it&#x27;s a terrible mistake for an actor to leave a series in the middle of it.&quot; Reynolds left &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in 1965. He later said that being in that show was &quot;the happiest period of my life. I hated to leave that show but I felt I had served my apprenticeship and there wasn&#x27;t room for two leading men.&quot;

He was cast in his first lead role in a movie, the low-budget action movie &quot;Operation C.I.A.&quot; (1965). He also guest-starred on the television series &quot;Flipper&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; and &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;.

===&quot;Hawk&quot; and leading roles in films===
Reynolds was given the title role of a TV series, &quot;Hawk&quot; (1966–67), playing Native American detective John Hawk. It ran for 17 episodes before being cancelled.

He played another Native American in the Italian Western film &quot;Navajo Joe&quot; (1966), which was filmed in Spain. He said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my favorite picture.&quot; He later said, &quot;I had two expressions—mad and madder.&quot;

He guest-starred in &quot;Gentle Ben&quot;, and made a pilot for a TV series, &quot;Lassiter&quot;, in which he would have played a magazine journalist. It did not develop into a series.

Reynolds made a series of movies in quick succession: &quot;Shark!&quot; (1969), filmed in Mexico, was directed by Sam Fuller, who removed his name from it, after which its release was held up for a number of years. Reynolds described &quot;Fade In&quot; as &quot;the best thing I&#x27;ve ever done&quot;, but it was not released for a number of years, and off of which director Jud Taylor took his name. &quot;Impasse&quot; (1969) was a war movie filmed in the Philippines. Reynolds plays the title role in &quot;Sam Whiskey&quot; (1969), a comic Western written by William W. Norton, which Reynolds later said was &quot;way ahead of its time. I was playing light comedy and nobody cared.&quot;

Reynolds starred with Jim Brown and Raquel Welch in another Western, &quot;100 Rifles&quot; (1969). He said, &quot;I spent the entire time refereeing fights between Jim Brown and Raquel Welch.&quot;

In a 1969 interview, Reynolds expressed interest in playing roles like the John Garfield part in &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot;, but no one gave him the opportunity. &quot;Instead, the producer hands me a script and says &#x27;I know it&#x27;s not there now kid, but I know we can make it work.&#x27;&quot;

Reynolds declined the leading role for the film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), which went to Elliott Gould. He starred in the film &quot;Skullduggery&quot; (1970), filmed in Jamaica. He joked that after making &quot;those wonderful, forgettable pictures... I suddenly realized I was as hot as Leo Gorcey.&quot;

Reynolds featured in two television films: &quot;Hunters Are for Killing&quot; (1970) and &quot;Run, Simon, Run&quot; (1970). In &quot;Hunters Are for Killing&quot;, his character was originally a Native American, but Reynolds requested that this element be changed, feeling that he had played the persona too many times already, and that it was not needed for the character anyway.

===&quot;Dan August&quot; and talk shows===

Reynolds played the title character in the police television drama &quot;Dan August&quot; (1970–71), produced by Quinn Martin. Reynolds had previously guest-starred in two episodes of Martin&#x27;s production &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; The series was given a full-season order of 26 episodes, based on the reputation of Martin and Reynolds, but it struggled in the ratings against &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; and was not renewed.

Albert R. Broccoli asked Reynolds to play James Bond after Sean Connery, but Reynolds declined the role, saying, &quot;An American can&#x27;t play James Bond. It just can&#x27;t be done.&quot;

After the cancelation of the series, Reynolds appeared in his first stage play in six years; a production of &quot;The Tender Trap&quot; at Arlington Park Theatre. He was offered other TV pilots, but was reluctant to play a detective again.

Around this time, he had become well known as a charismatic talk-show guest, starting with an appearance on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. He made jokes at his own expense, calling himself America&#x27;s most &quot;well-known unknown&quot; who made the kind of movies &quot;they show in airplanes or prisons or anywhere else the people can&#x27;t get out&quot;. He proved enormously popular and was frequently asked back by Griffin and Johnny Carson; he even guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. He was so popular as a guest that he was offered his own talk show, but he wanted to continue as an actor.

He later said that his talk show appearances were &quot;the best thing that ever happened to me. They changed everything drastically overnight. I spent ten years looking virile, saying, &#x27;Put up your hands.&#x27; After the Carson, Griffin, Frost, Dinah&#x27;s show, suddenly I have a personality.&quot;

&quot;I realized that people liked me, that I was enough,&quot; said Reynolds. &quot;So if I could transfer that character—the irreverent, self-deprecating side of me, my favorite side of me—onto the screen, I could have a big career.&quot;

===&quot;The Godfather&quot; and Marlon Brando feud===
Reynolds was considered for the role of Sonny Corleone in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, but Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s desire to cast James Caan in the part prevailed. There was talk that Reynolds&#x27;s participation was vetoed by Marlon Brando, who had a lack of respect for him. Brando denied that he played a role in thwarting the casting of Reynolds, saying in a January 1979 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview that Coppola would not have cast Reynolds in the part.

Reynolds later claimed that he declined the role of Sonny. (&quot;The Godfather&quot; producer Albert S. Ruddy would produce &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; and &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;, two Reynolds movie successes during the 1980s.)

The Brando-Reynolds feud became Hollywood legend. Reynolds said that he could not understand Brando&#x27;s enmity toward him. In a 2015 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Reynolds said, &quot;He was a strange man. He didn&#x27;t like me at all.&quot; He did not consciously imitate Brando, nor act like him, nor try to look like him; he even grew a mustache so that people would stop saying that he looked like Brando.

When he was finally introduced to Brando, Reynolds said that he told him that he was the finest actor in the world. Brando replied, &quot;I wish I could say the same for you.&quot;

===&quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; centerfold===
Reynolds had a major role in the movie &quot;Deliverance&quot;, directed by John Boorman, who cast him on the basis of a talk show appearance. &quot;It&#x27;s the first time I haven&#x27;t had a script with Paul Newman&#x27;s and Robert Redford&#x27;s fingerprints all over it,&quot; Reynolds joked. &quot;The producers actually came to me first.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;ve waited 15 years to do a really good movie,&quot; he said in 1972. &quot;I made so many bad pictures. I was never able to turn anyone down. The greatest curse in Hollywood is to be a well-known unknown.&quot;

It was around this time when Reynolds also gained notoriety when he began a well-publicized relationship with Dinah Shore, who was 20 years his senior, and after he posed nude in the April 1972 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. Reynolds said that he posed for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; for &quot;a kick. I have a strange sense of humor,&quot; and because he knew that &quot;Deliverance&quot; was about to be released. He later expressed regret for posing for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

&quot;Deliverance&quot; was a commercial and critical success, which, along with talk-show appearances, helped establish Reynolds as a major movie actor. &quot;The night of the Academy Awards, I counted a half-dozen Burt Reynolds jokes,&quot; he later said. &quot;I had become a household name, the most talked-about star at the award show.&quot;

Reynolds was subsequently in &quot;Fuzz&quot; (1972), reuniting with Welch, and also made a cameo in Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot; (1972). He also returned to the stage, appearing in &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; at the Arlington.

Reynolds had the title role of &quot;Shamus&quot; (1973), playing a private detective. The movie drew lackluster reviews, but nonetheless became a box-office success. Reynolds described it as &quot;not a bad film, kind of cute&quot;.

He was in &quot;The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing&quot; (1973), co-featuring Sarah Miles. The film was a minor success, perhaps best remembered for the scandal of Miles&#x27;s lover, an aspiring screenwriter, dying by suicide during the filming.

Reynolds meant to reunite with Boorman in &quot;Zardoz&quot;, but fell ill and was replaced by Sean Connery.

===&quot;White Lightning&quot; and Southern movies===
Another turning point in Reynolds&#x27;s career came when he made the light-hearted car-chase film written by William W. Norton, &quot;White Lightning&quot; (1973). Reynolds later called it &quot;the beginning of a whole series of films made in the South, about the South and for the South... you could make back the cost of the negative just in Memphis alone. Anything outside of that was just gravy.&quot; Car-chase movies would be Reynolds&#x27;s most profitable genre. At the end of 1973, Reynolds was voted into the list of the ten most-popular movie actors in the US at number four. He would stay on that list until 1984.

He made a sports comedy with Robert Aldrich, &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (1974), which was popular. Aldrich later said, &quot;I think that on occasion, he&#x27;s a much better actor than he&#x27;s given credit for. Not always: sometimes he acts like a caricature of himself.&quot;

Reynolds starred in two big-budget fiascos: &quot;At Long Last Love&quot; (1975), a musical for Peter Bogdanovich, and &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; (1975), with Gene Hackman and Liza Minnelli.

More popular was another light-hearted car-chase film, &quot;W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings&quot; (1975), and a police drama with Aldrich, &quot;Hustle&quot; (1975). He also had a cameo appearance in Mel Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976).

Toward the end of his life, Reynolds revealed that he declined the role of Han Solo in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Reynolds told &quot;Business Insider&quot; in 2016, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t want to play that kind of role at the time. ...Now I regret it. I wish I would have done it.&quot;

===Directorial work===
Reynolds made his directorial debut in 1976 with &quot;Gator&quot;, the sequel to &quot;White Lightning&quot;, written by Norton. &quot;I waited 20 years to do it [directing] and I enjoyed it more than anything I&#x27;ve ever done in this business,&quot; he said after filming. &quot;And I happen to think it&#x27;s what I do best.&quot;

He was reunited with Bogdanovich for the comedy &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; (1976), which was a commercial disappointment. Aldrich later commented, &quot;Bogdanovich can get him to do the telephone book! Anybody else has to persuade him to do something. He&#x27;s fascinated by Bogdanovich. I can&#x27;t understand it.&quot; He turned down the part of Clark Gable in &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot;.

===&quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; and career peak===

Reynolds had the biggest success of his career with the car-chase film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977), directed by Hal Needham and co-starring Jackie Gleason, Jerry Reed and Sally Field.

He followed it with a comedy about football players, &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; (1977), featuring Jill Clayburgh and Kris Kristofferson, and produced by David Merrick. He directed his second film &quot;The End&quot; (1978), a dark comedy, playing a role originally written for Woody Allen.

More popular was a comedy that he made with Needham and Field, &quot;Hooper&quot; (1978), in which he played an aging stunt man.

&quot;My ability as an actor gets a little better every time,&quot; he said about this time. &quot;I&#x27;m very prolific in the amount of films I make—two-and-a-half or three a year—and when I look at any picture I do now compared to &quot;Deliverance&quot;, it&#x27;s miles above what I was doing then. But when you&#x27;re doing films that are somewhat similar to each other, as I&#x27;ve been doing, people take it for granted.&quot;

For &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978), Reynolds declined a leading role, which went to Alan Alda.

Reynolds said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather direct than act. I&#x27;d rather do that than anything. It&#x27;s the second-best sensation I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; He added that David Merrick had offered to produce two movies that Reynolds would direct without having to act in them.

Reynolds tried a change of pace with &quot;Starting Over&quot; (1979), a romantic comedy, co-starring Jill Clayburgh and Candice Bergen. The film is co-written and produced by James L. Brooks. Reynolds plays a jewel thief in &quot;Rough Cut&quot; (1980) produced by Merrick, who fired and rehired director Don Siegel during filming.

Reynolds had two huge successes with more car films directed by Needham: &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981). He starred in David Steinberg&#x27;s film &quot;Paternity&quot; (1981) and directed himself in an action film, &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot; (1981).

Reynolds wanted to try a musical again, and agreed to do &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982). It was a box-office success, as was &quot;Best Friends&quot; (1982) with Goldie Hawn. In 1982, Reynolds was voted the most popular actor in the US for the fifth year in a row.

Around that time, he stated:

The only thing I really enjoy is this business, and I think my audience knows that. I&#x27;ve never been able to figure out exactly who that audience is. I know there have been a few pictures even my mother didn&#x27;t go see, but there&#x27;s always been an audience for them. I guess it is because they always know that I give it 100 percent, and good or bad, there&#x27;s going to be quite a lot of me in that picture. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re looking for. I don&#x27;t have any pretensions about wanting to be Hamlet. I would just like to be the best Burt Reynolds around.
===Career decline===
James L. Brooks wrote the role of astronaut Garrett Breedlove in &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983) with Reynolds in mind. However, Reynolds refused the role, and instead starred in another car-chase comedy &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; (1983), directed by Needham. The &quot;Endearment&quot; part went to Jack Nicholson, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Reynolds said in 1987, &quot;I felt I owed Hal more than I owed Jim,&quot; but &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; failed.

Reynolds admitted that refusing the role was a mistake. 

I regret that one most of all because it was a real acting part... I wish I would have done it, and thinking back now, it was really a stupid decision, but I made a lot of stupid decisions in that period. It must have been my stupid period.
In 1983, an unnamed producer said that while Reynolds&#x27;s salaries would not decrease because of &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;″s failure, &quot;if two or three more such pictures don&#x27;t work, people will just stop putting him in that kind of movie and that&#x27;s the kind of film for which he gets paid the most&quot;. Reynolds felt that it was a turning point in his career from which he never recovered. &quot;That&#x27;s where I lost them,&quot; he said of his fans.

For director Blake Edwards, Reynolds starred in &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot; (1983), a remake in English of François Truffaut&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;L&#x27;Homme qui aimait les femmes&quot;, but it also failed. In an interview at about this time, he said:

Getting to the top has turned out to be a hell of a lot more fun than staying there. I&#x27;ve got Tom Selleck crawling up my back. I&#x27;m in my late 40s. I realize I have four or five more years where I can play certain kinds of parts and get away with it. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m leaning more and more toward directing and producing. I don&#x27;t want to be stumbling around town doing Gabby Hayes parts a few years from now. I&#x27;d like to pick and choose and maybe go work for a perfume factory like Mr. Cary Grant, and look wonderful with everybody saying, &#x27;Gee, I wish he hadn&#x27;t retired&#x27;.

&quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), directed by Needham, brought in some money but only half of the original. &quot;City Heat&quot; (1984), which teamed Reynolds and Clint Eastwood, was mildly popular but was considered a major critical and box-office disappointment. Reynolds was injured badly during filming when he was hit in the jaw with a real chair instead of a breakaway prop, causing him excruciating chronic pain as well as a sharp weight loss that resulted in rumors circulating for years that he had AIDS.

Reynolds returned to directing with &quot;Stick&quot; (1985), from an Elmore Leonard novel, but it was both a critical and commercial failure. So too were three other action movies thay he made: &quot;Heat&quot; (1986), based on a novel by William Goldman, &quot;Malone&quot; (1987), and &quot;Rent-a-Cop&quot; (1987) with Liza Minnelli. He later said that he did &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;Malone&quot; &quot;because there were so many rumors about me [having AIDS]. I had to get out and be seen.&quot;

In 1987, Reynolds teamed with Bert Convy to co-produce the game show &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; for their production company Burt and Bert Productions. The show was based on &quot;sketch pad charades&quot;, a game that he often played with his friends in his living room in Jupiter. Vicki Lawrence hosted the daytime version for NBC, while Convy hosted the syndicated version until 1989, when he quit to host &quot;3rd Degree&quot;, also created by Reynolds and Convy.

Reynolds starred in &quot;Switching Channels&quot; (1988), a remake of the comedy &quot;The Front Page&quot;. It was a box-office bomb. Even more poorly received was &quot;Physical Evidence&quot; (1989), directed by Michael Crichton. Reynolds received excellent reviews for the caper comedy &quot;Breaking In&quot; (1989), but the commercial reception was poor. The moderately successful animated film &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; (1989), in which Reynolds voiced Charlie B. Barkin, was one of his few successes at the time.

&quot;When I was doing very well,&quot; he said at the time, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t conscious I was doing very well, but I became very conscious when I wasn&#x27;t doing very well. The atmosphere changed.&quot;

===Return to TV: &quot;BL Stryker&quot; and &quot;Evening Shade&quot;===
Reynolds returned to television with the detective series with &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot; (1989–90). It ran two seasons, during which time Reynolds played a supporting part in &quot;Modern Love&quot; (1990).

Reynolds starred in the situation comedy television series, &quot;Evening Shade&quot; (1990–94) as former Pittsburgh Steelers player Woodward &quot;Wood&quot; Newton. The series was a considerable success, with 98 episodes over four seasons. This role earned him a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Reynolds credited this role for his membership in Steeler Nation.

During his tenure on &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, Reynolds played in other projects, starting with a cameo in &quot;The Player&quot; (1992) (playing himself complaining about people in Hollywood).

Reynolds starred in the crime film &quot;Cop and a Half&quot; (1993). On August 25, the Randy Travis television special &quot;Wind in the Wire&quot; first aired; Reynolds was among the guests. On October 15, CBS first broadcast the television movie &quot;The Man from Left Field&quot;, co-featuring Reba McEntire. Reynolds starred and directed.

===Character actor===
After &quot;Evening Shade&quot; ended in 1994, Reynolds played the lead in a horror movie, &quot;The Maddening&quot; (1995). However, he gradually became more of a character actor – he had major support roles in &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; (1996), an early work from Alexander Payne, and &quot;Striptease&quot; (1996) with Demi Moore. He had to audition for the latter. The movie&#x27;s producer later said, &quot;To be honest, we were not enthusiastic at first. There was the hair and his reputation, but we were curious.&quot; Reynolds got the role and earned some strong reviews.

Reynolds was a supporting actor in &quot;Frankenstein and Me&quot; (1996), &quot;Mad Dog Time&quot; (1996), &quot;The Cherokee Kid&quot; (1996), &quot;Meet Wally Sparks&quot; (1997) with Rodney Dangerfield, and &quot;Bean&quot; (1997) with Rowan Atkinson. He had the lead in &quot;Raven&quot; (1996), a straight-to-video action movie. About this time he claimed he was depleted financially, having spent $13 million.

In 1996, Reynolds&#x27; agent said &quot;Regarding Burt, there&#x27;s a split between the executives in town who are under 40 and those who are over 40. The younger executives are more open to Burt because they grew up loving &quot;Deliverance&quot;. But the older executives remember how crazy he was, and they are less receptive.&quot; He also hosted segments for the Encore Action premium cable network during the late 1990s and 2000s.

===&quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and career revival===

Reynolds played a porn film director in the successful film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), which was considered a comeback role for him. He received 12 acting awards and three nominations for the role, including a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Reynolds&#x27; first and only nomination for the award.

Reynolds disliked the film and dismissed his agent for recommending it. &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; co-star William H. Macy stated in an interview that Reynolds was clueless about the film and had become out of touch with the film industry due to his age.

Reynolds was offered a role in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s third film, &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999), but he declined, saying that he hated working with Anderson and his film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. In his second autobiography, &quot;But Enough About Me&quot; (2015), Reynolds attempted to come to terms with his difficult nature. In a 2015 &quot;GQ&quot; interview, he said that his problem with Anderson was a matter of their differing personalities:

Despite his Oscar nomination for &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and a new appreciation of his acting talent by movie critics, Reynolds failed to return to the A list; while work was plentiful, prestige projects were lacking.

He had the lead in &quot;Big City Blues&quot; (1997) and supporting roles in &quot;Universal Soldier II: Brothers in Arms&quot; (1998) and &quot;Universal Soldier III: Unfinished Business&quot; (1998).

Reynolds returned to directing with &quot;Hard Time&quot; (1998), an action TV movie featuring himself. It resulted in two sequels, which he did not direct, &quot;Hard Time: The Premonition&quot; (1999) and &quot;Hard Time: Hostage Hotel&quot; (1999) (the latter directed by Hal Needham).

He featured in the straight-to-video &quot;The Hunter&#x27;s Moon&quot; (1999), &quot;Stringer&quot; (1999), and &quot;Waterproof&quot; (2000). He played supporting roles in &quot;Pups&quot; (1999) and &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot; (1999), and had the lead in &quot;The Crew&quot; (2000) alongside Richard Dreyfuss.

Reynolds directed &quot;The Last Producer&quot; (2000), featuring himself, and was second-billed in Renny Harlin&#x27;s &quot;Driven&quot; (2001), featuring Sylvester Stallone. He was also in &quot;Tempted&quot; (2001), &quot;Hotel&quot; (2001) (directed by Mike Figgis), and &quot;The Hollywood Sign&quot; (2001).

He voiced Avery Carrington in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, released in 2002.

Reynolds was top-billed in &quot;Snapshots&quot; with Julie Christie, an $11 million Anglo-Dutch-American picture that failed to find a wide release. He also featured in &quot;Time of the Wolf&quot; (2002) and &quot;Hard Ground&quot; (2003), and had supporting roles in &quot;Johnson County War&quot; (2002) with Tom Berenger, and &quot;Miss Lettie and Me&quot; (2003) with Mary Tyler Moore.

He was in a series of supporting roles that referred to earlier performances: &quot;Without a Paddle&quot; (2004), a riff on his role in &quot;Deliverance&quot;, &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; (2005), a remake of his 1974 success with Adam Sandler playing Reynolds&#x27; old role (while Reynolds played the Michael Conrad part from the original); and &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (2005) as Boss Hogg as a reference to his performances in 1970s car-chase movies.

Reynolds continued to play lead roles in movies such as &quot;Cloud 9&quot; (2006), &quot;Forget About It&quot; (2006), &quot;Deal&quot; (2008), and &quot;A Bunch of Amateurs&quot; (2008), and supporting parts in &quot;End Game&quot; (2006), &quot;Grilled&quot; (2006), &quot;Broken Bridges&quot; (2006), &quot;In the Name of the King&quot; (2007), &quot;Not Another Not Another Movie&quot; (2011), and &quot;Reel Love&quot; (2011).

He had a guest role in an episode of &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, &quot;Past &amp; Future Tense&quot; (2010).

Reynolds voiced himself as the Mayor of Steelport in &quot;Saints Row: The Third&quot;, released in 2011. Players can recruit Reynolds as a &quot;homie&quot;, depending on their in-game choices.

Reynolds also voiced himself in the animated series &quot;Archer&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Man from Jupiter&quot; (2012). The character of Sterling Archer was largely inspired by Burt Reynolds.

He was top billed in &quot;Category 5&quot; (2014) and &quot;Elbow Grease&quot; (2016) and could be seen in key roles in &quot;Pocket Listing&quot; (2016), and &quot;Hollow Creek&quot; (2015). He returned to a regular role on TV in &quot;Hitting the Breaks&quot; (2016) but it only ran for ten episodes. He was in &quot;Apple of My Eye&quot; (2016) and took the lead in &quot;The Last Movie Star&quot; (2017).

In May 2018, Reynolds joined the cast of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s movie &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; as George Spahn (an eighty year old blind man who rented out his ranch to Charles Manson), but he died before filming his scenes and was replaced by Bruce Dern.

===Posthumous releases===
Reynolds appeared posthumously in the 2019 movie &quot;An Innocent Kiss&quot; as well as in the 2020 movie &quot;Defining Moments&quot;, which includes his final performance.

===Other ventures===
Reynolds was credited as the author of a 1972 mass market paperback book &quot;Hot Line: The Letters I Get...And Write!&quot; that featured semi-nude &quot;beefcake&quot; photos of the actor, playing up his image as a male sex symbol. He also published two autobiographies, &quot;My Life&quot; in 1994 and &quot;But Enough About Me&quot; in 2015.

Reynolds co-authored the 1997 children&#x27;s book, &quot;Barkley Unleashed: A Pirate&#x27;s Tail&quot;, a &quot;whimsical tale [that] illustrates the importance of perseverance, the wonders of friendship and the power of imagination&quot;.

In 1973, Reynolds released the country/easy listening album &quot;Ask Me What I Am&quot;. He also sang in two movie musicals: &quot;At Long Last Love&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982).

==Personal life==

Reynolds in college &quot;was so good-looking, I used him as bait,&quot; college roommate Lee Corso recalled. &quot;He&#x27;d walk across campus and bring back two girls, one beautiful and one ugly; I got the ugly girl. His ugly girlfriends were better than anyone I could get on my own.&quot;

===Marriages and long-term relationships===
Reynolds was married to English actress Judy Carne from 1963 to 1965. He lived with actress Miko Mayama from 1968 to 1971. He and American singer-actress Dinah Shore (20 years his senior) were in a relationship from early 1971 until 1975. In the mid-1970s, Reynolds briefly dated singer Tammy Wynette.

He had a relationship from 1976 to 1980 (then off-and-on until 1982) with American actress Sally Field, during which time they appeared together in four movies. In 2016, he regarded Field as the love of his life.

Reynolds was married to American actress Loni Anderson from 1988 to 1994. They adopted a son, Quinton. He and Anderson separated after he became infatuated with a cocktail waitress, Pam Seals, with whom he later traded lawsuits, which were settled out of court.

===Business endeavors===

====Professional sports====
A lifelong fan of football, he once told Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; he would rather have played in the NFL than win an Oscar. Reynolds was a minority owner of the Tampa Bay Bandits of the USFL from 1982 to 1986. The team&#x27;s name was inspired by the &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; trilogy and Skoal Bandit, a primary sponsor for the team as a result of also sponsoring Reynolds&#x27; motor racing team.

Reynolds co-owned a NASCAR Winston Cup Series team, Mach 1 Racing, with Hal Needham, which ran the No. 33 Skoal Bandit car with driver Harry Gant.

====Restaurants and dinner theater====
During the late 1970s, Reynolds opened Burt&#x27;s Place, a nightclub restaurant in the Omni International Complex in Atlanta in the Hotel District of Downtown Atlanta. The establishment closed after a year. (&quot;Burt&#x27;s Place&quot; also was the name of a building that was part of the guest house complex at Reynolds&#x27; Tequesta, Florida estate in Palm Beach County, Florida.)

He also owned the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre in Jupiter, Florida, with an emphasis on training young performers trying to enter show business. The theater opened in 1979 and was later renamed the Burt Reynolds Jupiter Theater. Reynolds operated it until 1989 and leased it until 1996. It had a series of ownership changes until becoming the Maltz Jupiter Theatre in 2004.

In 1984, he opened a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, named Burt &amp; Jacks, which he co-owned with Jack Jackson. The restaurant was defunct at the time of his death.

Partnering with Killen Music Group owner Buddy Killen, Reynolds invested in Po&#x27; Folks, a chain of country-cooking, family-style restaurants located in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. The chain, which was named after a Bill Anderson song, along with subsequent Killen-Reynolds investment in another Southern restaurant chain, failed.

===Personal bankruptcy===
During the height of his movie career, Reynolds made as much as $10 million a year. However, he proved to be a poor businessman.

Along with music industry executive Buddy Killen, who produced his 1973 country and western/easy listening album &quot;Ask Me What I Am&quot;, Reynolds invested in Po&#x27; Folks, a Southern regional restaurant chain named after a Bill Anderson song. As Po&#x27; Folks failed, Reynolds and Killen invested in another regional chain, Daisy&#x27;s Diner, which also failed. Reynolds had invested the capital as an individual, not as a corporate investment, and was responsible personally for the liabilities when Po&#x27; Folks and the Daisy&#x27;s Diner failed. In all, his investments in the restaurant industry resulted in losses of $20 million.

Reynolds suffered a steep decrease of his career earnings after the cancellation of &quot;Evening Shade&quot;, as his popularity waned due to bad publicity from his divorce from Loni Anderson, which became tabloid fodder. His decrease of earnings as an actor plus the great expense of his divorce settlement, child support and alimony payments to Anderson caused a cash depletion by the mid-1990s.

CBS, the network that produced &quot;Evening Shade&quot; and managed the program&#x27;s syndication, sued him for failing to repay a $3.7 million loan in 1996. Subsequently, he filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, due in part to an extravagant lifestyle, a divorce from Loni Anderson and failed investments in restaurant chains. Reynolds emerged from bankruptcy two years later.

During his bankruptcy proceedings, Reynolds listed $6.65 million in assets against debts totaling $11.2 million.

On August 16, 2011, Merrill Lynch Credit Corporation filed foreclosure papers, claiming Reynolds owed US$1.2 million on his home in Hobe Sound, Florida.

Until its sale during bankruptcy, he owned the Burt Reynolds Ranch, where scenes for &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; were filmed and which once had a petting zoo. In April 2014, the 153-acre (62 ha) rural property was rezoned for residential use and the Palm Beach County school system was empowered to sell it, which it did to the residential developer K. Hovnanian Homes.

===Health problems===
Reynolds suffered from hypoglycemia, which he discussed publicly on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. During his numerous appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Reynolds also told Johnny Carson that he suffered from anxiety.

The Stuntmen&#x27;s Association of Motion Pictures awarded the Richard &quot;Diamond&quot; Farnsworth Award to Reynolds in 2015. Richard Farnsworth was a stunt man who made the transition into a successful acting career. Having performed stunts early during his career, the debilitating health problems of an aging stunt man was central to the storyline of Reynolds&#x27; 1978 movie &quot;Hooper&quot;, which is subtitled on the poster &quot;The Greatest Stuntman Alive.&quot;

Reynolds, who said he was a card-carrying member of the stunt performers guild, often performed his own stunts in movies, such as the fall over the waterfall in &quot;Deliverance&quot;, where he injured his coccyx. He also had to be operated on for a hernia that resulted from a fight scene in &quot;The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing&quot;.

His worst on-set injury occurred while filming &quot;City Heat&quot; in 1984, Reynolds was struck in the face with a metal chair on the first day of filming, which resulted in temporomandibular joint dysfunction. He was restricted to a liquid diet and lost 30 pounds from not eating. The painkillers he was prescribed resulted in addiction, which lasted several years.

He underwent back surgery in 2009 and a quintuple coronary artery bypass surgery in February 2010.

== Death and tributes==
Reynolds died of a heart attack at the Jupiter Medical Center in Jupiter, Florida, on September 6, 2018, at the age of 82. His ex-wife Loni Anderson and their son Quinton held a private memorial service for Reynolds at a funeral home in North Palm Beach, Florida, on September 20. Those in attendance included Sally Field, FSU coach Bobby Bowden, friend Lee Corso, and quarterback Doug Flutie. Reynolds&#x27; body was cremated and his ashes were given to his niece, Nancy Lee Brown Hess. He was subsequently interred at Hollywood Forever Cemetery on February 11, 2021. In September of that year, a bronze bust of Reynolds was placed at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

On the day of Reynolds&#x27; death, Antenna TV, which broadcasts &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; nightly, broadcast an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; from February 11, 1982, featuring an interview and a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;-style skit with Reynolds. The local media in Atlanta and elsewhere in the state noted on their television news programs that evening that he was the first to make major movies in Georgia, all of which were successful, which helped make the state one of the top filming locations in the country. The Florida State football team honored Reynolds with helmet decals reading &quot;BAN ONE&quot;, in the design and style of the license plate of the Trans Am from &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, plus Reynolds&#x27; signature, worn for the rest of the 2018 season. His niece, Nancy Lee Hess, produced a 2020 biography and documentary about Reynolds titled &quot;I Am Burt Reynolds&quot;.

== Legacy and appraisal ==
During the height of his career, Reynolds was considered a male sex symbol and icon of American masculinity. Stephen Dalton wrote in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that Reynolds &quot;always seemed to embody an uncomplicated, undiluted, effortlessly likable strain of American masculinity that was driven much more by sunny mischief than angsty machismo.&quot; Reynolds&#x27;s roles were often defined by his larger-than-life physicality and masculinity, contrasted with juvenile but self-aware humor. Though he was not considered a serious dramatic actor during his heyday, his later career was defined by performances that often referenced his own reputation, creating what Dalton called &quot;sophisticated, soulful performances&quot;.

Michael Chiklis has credited Reynolds for rescuing his acting career when Reynolds hired him for a role in &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot; after Chiklis was &quot;blackballed&quot; for his involvement in portraying John Belushi in the movie &quot;Wired&quot; (1989). Chiklis said that Reynolds knew what Chiklis was going through because he &quot;grew up during the McCarthy era and didn&#x27;t believe in blackballing.&quot;

<text>UN/CEFACT is the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business. It was established as an intergovernmental body of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in 1996 and evolved from UNECE&#x27;s long tradition of work in trade facilitation which began in 1957.

UN/CEFACT&#x27;s goal is &quot;Simple, Transparent and Effective Processes for Global Commerce.&quot; It aims to help business, trade and administrative organizations from developed, developing and transition economies to exchange products and services effectively. To this end, it focuses on simplifying national and international transactions by harmonizing processes, procedures and information flows related to these transactions, rendering these more efficient and streamlined, with the ultimate goal of contributing to the growth of global commerce.

== Trade facilitation and electronic business==
UN/CEFACT focusses on two main areas of activity to make international trade processes more efficient and streamlined, namely: trade facilitation and electronic business.

Trade facilitation involves the simplification of trade procedures (or the elimination of unnecessary procedures). This includes work to standardize and harmonize the core information used in trade documents, to ease the flow of information between parties by relying on appropriate information and communication technology, and to promote simplified payment systems to foster transparency, accountability and cost-effectiveness.

Electronic business, in the UN/CEFACT context, focuses on harmonizing, standardizing and automating the exchange of information that controls the flow of goods along the international supply chain. UN/CEFACT&#x27;s work on electronic business is driven by the understanding that goods cannot move faster than the processes and information that accompany them.

UN/CEFACT takes a total trade transaction approach to trade facilitation and associated electronic business, covering all the processes from initial placement of orders through to final payments. This is best illustrated through the UN/CEFACT Buy-Ship-Pay model of the international supply chain, which forms the basis of its work.

== Deliverables==
UN/CEFACT has produced over 30 trade facilitation recommendations and a range of electronic business standards (collectively referred to as “instruments”) which are used throughout the world by both governments and the private sector. They reflect best practices in trade procedures and data and documentary requirements. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has adopted many of them as international standards.

UN/CEFACT Recommendations and Standards are implemented throughout the world. Some of the more well known instruments are:

&quot;Recommendation 1: United Nations Layout Key (UNLK) for Trade Documents.&quot; This provides an international basis for the standardized layout of documents used in international trade. The Layout Key facilitates the exchange of information between the various parties involved in a commercial transaction and is used as the basis for many key trade documents such as the European Union&#x27;s Single Administrative Document (SAD); FIATA&#x27;s Freight Forwarding Instruction; UNECE&#x27;s Dangerous Goods Declaration; and the World Customs Organization (WCO) Goods Declaration for Export. Use of the UN Layout Key is specifically recommended in the WCO&#x27;s Revised Kyoto Convention. It is important to note that the Layout Key is so widely used in international trade that many expect normal trade documents to conform to the Recommendation.

&quot;Recommendation 16: UN/LOCODE Code for Trade and Transport Locations&quot; provides an alphabetic code for seaports, airports, inland freight terminals and other customs clearance sites. Recommended by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), it is used by most major shipping companies and also by the universal Postal Union (UPU). UN/LOCODE&#x27;s website is regularly visited, accounting for 6% of all “hits” to the UNECE website. The first issue of UN/LOCODE in 1981 provided codes to represent the names of some 8000 locations in the world. Today, UN/LOCODE, which is updated twice annually, contains almost 100 000 entries with strong demand for further updates and extension. Every recognised national and international airport or maritime port will have a UN/LOCODE coding.

&quot;Recommendation 25 and the UN/EDIFACT Standard&quot; represent a set of internationally agreed standards, directories, and guidelines for the electronic interchange of structured data, between independent computerized information systems. UN/EDIFACT is the international standard for Electronic data interchange and is used throughout the commercial and administrative world. UN/EDIFACT accounts for over 90% of all electronic data interchange (EDI) messages exchanged globally. UN/EDIFACT messages are used by almost all national customs administrations, all major seaports and a large range of companies (including over 100 000 in the retail sector), and throughout international supply chains. For example, more than 7 million EDIFACT messages are exchanged each year in the French agricultural supply chain.

&quot;Recommendation 33 on Single Windows&quot; proposes that governments establish a Single Window facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents with a single entry point to fulfil all import, export and transit-related regulatory requirements. A suite of complementary Single Window Recommendations has also been developed, namely Recommendation 34 on Data Simplification and Standardization and 35 on Establishing a Legal Framework for Single Windows.

A family of &quot;Supply Chain “Cross-Industry” messages&quot; are exchanged globally between trading partners covering the majority of business-to-business (B2B) electronic exchanges from order to payment. One of the key documents within this family is the Cross Industry Invoice (CII) which functions primarily as a request for payment, used as a key document for Value Added Tax (VAT) declaration and reclamation, for statistics declarations and to support export and import declarations in international trade.

The &quot;eDAPLOS message&quot; describes the data crop sheet exchanged between farmers and their partners. This message has allowed users to harmonize the definitions of technical data, develop consensual data dictionaries which can be used as a basis for all the steps of traceability and create a standardized Crop Data Sheet message. DAPLOS, which is based on the UN/CEFACT Core Component Library, has been adopted by 25 000 farmers and regional agriculture chambers in France and Belgium.

CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) has developed a version of their declaration using the Core Component Library of UN/CEFACT and has generated an XML message according to the specifications of UN/CEFACT. CITES is an international agreement between governments. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. The CITES declarations are used in customs clearance procedures in all countries around the globe.

== Benefits ==
Governments, traders and consumers all benefit from having simpler and more cost-effective trade procedures. UN/CEFACT&#x27;s work is particularly relevant for developing countries, where the elimination of trade-related inefficiencies is many times more beneficial than the reduction or removal of tariff barriers to trade. In addition, UN/CEFACT&#x27;s work is of particular benefit to landlocked countries and countries distant from major markets. These countries experience challenges and constraints resulting from complex and inefficient procedures, including the creation of many additional costs in bringing goods to market. The gains from this work are considerable for small and medium-sized enterprises, for which the costs of compliance with various trade-related procedures are proportionally higher. This is particularly true in the case of low-value shipments, where the cost of administrative procedures represents a large proportion of total cost.

==Structure==
In view of the global character of its work on trade facilitation and electronic business standards, UN/CEFACT is open to representatives of all UN member states and all organisations recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The participation of developing countries and countries in transition in standards development processes is strongly encouraged.

The highest authority regarding all aspects of UN/CEFACT&#x27;s work is the intergovernmental Plenary which meets once a year in Geneva. Delegations to the Plenary include UN member states, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) recognized by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC). Only UN member states have the right to vote at Plenary meetings – all other members are observers.

The Plenary elects the UN/CEFACT Bureau which consists of a chair and at least four vice-chairs. The Bureau acts in the name of the Plenary between sessions and meets physically an average of four times per year and more frequently through virtual conference calls.

Each UN member state may nominate a permanent Head of Delegation (HOD) to UN/CEFACT. HODs participate in the Plenary, are consulted by the bureau on key strategic issues, and are responsible for nominating experts to participate in UN/CEFACT activities.

The technical work to develop UN/CEFACT standards and recommendations is done by over 200 volunteer experts from around the world, nominated by HODs. The experts come from both the public and the private sectors, forming a public-private partnership in support of trade facilitation and electronic business. They participate as independent volunteer experts in their own right, without representing any special interests of their countries or institutions. The experts are representatives from:

* Governments 
* Private companies 
* Intergovernmental organizations 
* Industry associations (representing large collective groups of private-sector companies) 
* Academia

UN/CEFACT experts meet physically in UN/CEFACT Forums, which are held twice a year (one in Geneva and one hosted by a UN member state) in order to coordinate their work. The vast majority of the work is done virtually between forums.

UNECE provides secretarial support to UN/CEFACT in order that the Centre may implement its programme of work. Annually, the UN/CEFACT Bureau (acting on behalf of the Plenary) and the UNECE Secretariat plan for the implementation of UN/CEFACT&#x27;s programme of work, taking into account the resources available from both the United Nations and externally. The secretariat takes responsibility for supporting the work of UN/CEFACT including supporting the maintenance of Recommendations and standards; and handles the administrative functions related to UN/CEFACT, including UN oversight, organizing meetings and preparing official documents and papers.

<doc id="178248" wikidata="Q706888" url="?curid=178248" title="Hermann Samuel Reimarus">
<text>Hermann Samuel Reimarus (22 December 1694, Hamburg – 1 March 1768, Hamburg), was a German philosopher and writer of the Enlightenment who is remembered for his Deism, the doctrine that human reason can arrive at a knowledge of God and ethics from a study of nature and our own internal reality, thus eliminating the need for religions based on revelation. He denied the supernatural origin of Christianity, and was the first influential critic to investigate the historical Jesus. According to Reimarus, Jesus was a mortal Jewish prophet, and the apostles founded Christianity as a religion separate from Jesus’ own ministry.

==Biography==

Reimarus was educated by his father and by the scholar J. A. Fabricius, whose son-in-law he subsequently became. He attended school at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. He studied theology, ancient languages, and philosophy at the University of Jena, became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at the University of Wittenberg in 1716, and in 1720–21 visited the Netherlands and England. In 1723 he became rector of the high school at Wismar, and in 1727 professor of Hebrew and Oriental languages at his native city&#x27;s high school. Although he was offered more lucrative positions by other schools, he held this post until his death.

His duties were light; and he employed his leisure in the study of philology, mathematics, philosophy, history, political economy, science and natural history, for which he made large collections. His house was the center of the highest culture of Hamburg; and a monument of his influence in that city still remains in the &quot;Haus der patriotischen Gesellschaft&quot;, where the learned and artistic societies partly founded by him still meet. He had seven children, only three of whom survived him – the distinguished physician Johann Albert Heinrich Reimarus, and two daughters, one of them being Elise Reimarus, Lessing&#x27;s friend and correspondent. Reimarus died on 1 March 1768.

==Publications==

Reimarus&#x27; reputation as a scholar rests on the valuable edition of &quot;Dio Cassius&quot; (1750–52) which he prepared from the materials collected by Johann Andreas Fabricius. He published a work on logic (&quot;Vernunftlehre als Anweisung zum richtigen Gebrauche der Vernunft&quot;, 1756, 5th ed., 1790), and two popular books on the religious questions of the day. The first of these was a collection of essays on the principal truths of natural religion (&quot;Abhandlungen von den vornehmsten Wahrheiten der natürlichen Religion&quot;, 1755, 7th ed., 1798); the second (&quot;Betrachtungen über die Triebe der Thiere&quot;, 1760, 4th ed., 1798) dealt with one particular branch of the same subject.

But Reimarus&#x27; main contribution to theological science was his analysis of the historical Jesus, &quot;Apologie oder Schutzschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer Gottes&quot; (&quot;An apology for, or some words in defense of, reasoning worshippers of God&quot; – read by only a few intimate friends during his lifetime), which he left unpublished. After Reimarus&#x27; death, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing published parts of this work as &quot;Fragments by an Anonymous Writer&quot; in his &quot;Zur Geschichte und Literatur&quot; in 1774–1778, giving rise to what is known as the &quot;Fragmentenstreit&quot;. This had a deep impact as the beginning of critical research of the &quot;historical Jesus&quot;.

Reimarus pointed out the differences between what Jesus said and what the apostles said, identifying Jesus as a Jewish preacher. Jesus, according to this view, was an apocalyptic prophet preaching about a worldly kingdom soon to come. This view still has currency within modern scholarship. Reimarus also considered Christianity to be a fabrication.

Reimarus&#x27; philosophical position is essentially that of Christian Wolff, but he is best known for his &quot;Apologie&quot; as excerpted by Lessing in what became known as the &quot;Wolfenbüttel Fragmente&quot;. The original manuscript is in the Hamburg town library. A copy was made for the university library of Göttingen, 1814, and other copies are known to exist. In addition to the seven fragments published by Lessing, a second portion of the work was issued in 1787 by C. A. E. Schmidt (a pseudonym), under the title &quot;Übrige noch ungedruckte Werke des Wolfenbüttelschen Fragmentisten&quot;, and a further portion by D. W. Klose in Christian Wilhelm Niedner&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift für historische Theologie&quot;, 1850-52. The complete work has been published as edited by Gerhard Alexander (2 vols, Frankfurt am Main: Insel, 1972). D. F. Strauss has given an exhaustive analysis of the whole work in his book on Reimarus.

The standpoint of the &quot;Apologie&quot; is that of pure naturalistic Deism. Miracles and mysteries are denied and natural religion is put forward as the absolute contradiction of revealed religion. The essential truths of the former are the existence of a wise and good Creator and the immortality of the soul. These truths are discoverable by reason, and can constitute the basis of a universal religion. A revealed religion could never obtain universality, as it could never be intelligible and credible to all men. However, the Bible does not present such a revelation. It abounds in error as to matters of fact, contradicts human experience, reason and morals, and is one tissue of folly, deceit, enthusiasm, selfishness and crime. Moreover, it is not a doctrinal compendium, or catechism, which a revelation would have to be.

According to Reimarus, the Old Testament says little of the worship of God, and that little is worthless, while its writers are unacquainted with the second fundamental truth of religion, the immortality of the soul (see sheol). The design of the writers of the New Testament, as well as that of Jesus, was not to teach true rational religion, but to serve their own selfish ambitions, thereby exhibiting an amazing combination of conscious fraud and enthusiasm. However, it is important to remember that Reimarus attacked atheism with equal effect and sincerity.

==Analysis==
Estimates of Reimarus may be found in the works of B. Pünjer, Otto Pfleiderer and Harald Høffding. Pünjer states the position of Reimarus as follows: &quot;God is the Creator of the world, and His wisdom and goodness are conspicuous in it. Immortality is founded upon the essential nature of man and upon the purpose of God in creation. Religion is conducive to our happiness and alone brings satisfaction. Miracles are at variance with the divine purpose; without miracles there could be no revelation.&quot;

Pfleiderer says the errors of Reimarus were that he ignored historical and literary criticism, sources, date, origin, etc., of documents, and the narratives were said to be either purely divine or purely human. He had no conception of an immanent reason.

Høffding also has a brief section on the &quot;Apologie&quot;, stating its main position as follows:

The work of Reimarus was highly praised by Albert Schweitzer. While calling the views expressed in the &quot;Fragments&quot; mistaken in some respects and one-sided, Schweitzer describes the essay on &quot;The Aims of Jesus and His Disciples&quot; as not only &quot;one of the greatest events in the history of criticism&quot; but also &quot;a masterpiece of general literature&quot;. Lessing&#x27;s third excerpt in &quot;Fragments&quot;, &quot;On the Passing of the Israelites Through the Red Sea,&quot; is said to be &quot;one of the ablest, wittiest and most acute which has ever been written.&quot;

Richard N. Soulen points out that Reimarus &quot;is treated as the initiator of ‘Lives of Jesus Research’ by Schweitzer and accorded special honour by him for recognising that Jesus&#x27; thought-world was essentially eschatological, a fact overlooked until the end of the 19th century.&quot;

<text>Raymond Wallace Bolger (; January 10, 1904 – January 15, 1987) was an American actor, dancer, singer, vaudevillian, and stage performer (particularly musical theater) who started his movie career in the silent-film era. 

Bolger was a major Broadway performer in the 1930s and beyond. He is best known for his roles in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) as the Scarecrow and in Walt Disney&#x27;s holiday musical fantasy &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; in 1961 as the villainous Barnaby. 

Bolger was the host of &quot;The Ray Bolger Show&quot; on TV from 1953 to 1955, originally titled &quot;Where&#x27;s Raymond?&quot;

==Early life==
Raymond Wallace Bolger was born at 598 Second St., South Boston, Massachusetts, into a Catholic family of Irish descent. He was the son of James Edward Bolger and Anne C. (née Wallace). His father, James, was a first-generation American of Irish descent, who was born in Fall River, Massachusetts. Bolger&#x27;s mother &quot;Annie&quot; was born into a large Irish-American family in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. 

Bolger grew up and attended school in the Codman Square section of the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston.

==Career==
===Early career===
His entertainment aspirations evolved from the vaudeville shows of his youth. He began his career in a vaudeville tap show, creating the act &quot;Sanford &amp; Bolger&quot; with his dance partner. In 1926, he danced at New York City&#x27;s legendary Palace Theatre, the premier vaudeville theater in the United States. His limber body and improvisational dance movements won him many leading roles on Broadway in the 1930s. Eventually, his career also encompassed film, television, and nightclub work. In 1932 he was elected to the theater club The Lambs and performed on opening night at Radio City Music Hall in December 1932.

After starring in Richard Rodgers&#x27; first stage production of &quot;On Your Toes&quot; in 1936, in which he played the male lead Junior, as well as the hero of the &quot;Slaughter on Tenth Avenue&quot; ballet within the musical, Bolger signed his first cinema contract with MGM in 1936, and although &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was early in his film career, he appeared in other movies of note. His best-known pre-Oz appearance was &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936), in which he portrayed himself. He also appeared in &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1938), the first MGM film in Technicolor, starring Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald. He also appeared in the Eleanor Powell vehicle &quot;Rosalie&quot; (1937), which also starred Eddy and Frank Morgan.

=== &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; ===

Bolger&#x27;s MGM contract stipulated that he would play any part the studio chose. However, he was unhappy when he was originally cast as the Tin Woodman in the studio&#x27;s 1939 feature-film adaptation of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The role of the Scarecrow had already been assigned to another dancing, studio-contract player, Buddy Ebsen. In time, the roles were shuffled around. Bolger&#x27;s face was permanently lined by wearing the Scarecrow&#x27;s makeup.

=== Post-Oz film career ===
Following &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Bolger moved to RKO Pictures. In 1941, he was a featured act at the Paramount Theatre in New York, working with the Harry James Band. He would do tap dance routines, sometimes in a mock-challenge dance with the band&#x27;s pianist, Al Lerner. 

On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and Bolger&#x27;s performance was interrupted by President Roosevelt&#x27;s announcement of the news of the attack. Bolger toured in USO shows in the Pacific Theater during World War II, and appeared in the United Artists wartime film &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; (1943).

In 1946, he returned to MGM for a featured role in &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot;. Also that year, he recorded a children&#x27;s album, &quot;The Churkendoose&quot;, featuring the story of a misfit fowl (&quot;part chicken, turkey, duck, and goose&quot;), which teaches children that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it &quot;all depends on how you look at things&quot;.

===Broadway===

Bolger&#x27;s Broadway credits included &quot;Life Begins at 8:40&quot; (1934), &quot;On Your Toes&quot; (1936), &quot;By Jupiter&quot; (1942), &quot;All American&quot; (1962) and &quot;Where&#x27;s Charley?&quot; (1948), for which he won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical and in which he introduced &quot;Once in Love with Amy&quot;, the song often connected with him. He repeated his stage role in the 1952 film version of the musical.

===Television===
Bolger appeared in his own ABC television sitcom with a variety show theme, &quot;Where&#x27;s Raymond?&quot; (1953–1954), renamed the second year as &quot;The Ray Bolger Show&quot; (1954–55). He continued to star in several films, including Walt Disney&#x27;s remake of &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1961) and smaller cameos throughout the 1960s and 1970.

Bolger made frequent guest appearances on television, including the episode &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; of the short-lived &quot;The Jean Arthur Show&quot; in 1966. In the 1970s, he had a recurring role as Fred Renfrew, the father of Shirley Partridge (Shirley Jones) on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, and appeared in &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; as Toby Noe and also guest-starred on other television series, such as &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. In the late 1970s, Bolger played in a commercial for Safeway Supermarket&#x27;s &quot;Scotch Buy&quot; brand, in which he popularized the jingle, &quot;Scotch Buy – &#x27;taint fancy, but it shore is good.&quot; His last television appearance was on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; in 1984, three years before his death.

In 1976 Bolger performed the opening number for the 48th Academy Awards ceremony.

In his later years, he danced in a Dr Pepper television commercial, and in 1985, he and Liza Minnelli, the daughter of his &quot;Oz&quot; costar Judy Garland, starred in &quot;That&#x27;s Dancing!&quot;, a film written by Jack Haley Jr., the son of Jack Haley, who portrayed the Tin Woodman in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==Honors==
In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

In 2016, the City of Boston commissioned a mural in Ray Bolger&#x27;s honor in the Codman Square section of the Dorchester neighborhood.

==Personal life==
Bolger was married to Gwendolyn Rickard for more than 57 years. They had no children. He was a Roman Catholic and a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.

Bolger was a lifelong Republican who campaigned for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election and Richard Nixon in the 1968 election.

Bolger had 11 nieces and nephews.

==Death and legacy==
Bolger was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1986, and at the end of that year, his health deteriorated and he left his Beverly Hills home to live at a nursing home in Los Angeles, where he died on January 15, 1987, at the age of 83.

At the time of his death, Bolger was the last surviving main-credited cast member of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. He was the only one of Judy Garland&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; costars who attended her funeral, joining Harold Arlen, the composer of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, and his wife, Anya Taranda. They were reported as among the last remaining guests at the conclusion of the service.

Whenever asked whether he had received any residuals from telecasts of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Bolger would reply: &quot;No, just immortality. I&#x27;ll settle for that.&quot; Bolger&#x27;s Scarecrow is ranked among the &quot;most beloved movie characters of all time&quot; by AMC and the American Film Institute.

For his contributions to the film industry, Bolger received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. It is located at 6788 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 2019, the first comprehensive biography of Bolger, &quot;More Than a Scarecrow&quot; by Holly Van Leuven, was published.

<doc id="178253" wikidata="Q45671" url="?curid=178253" title="Anfield">
<text>Anfield is a football stadium in the area of Anfield, Liverpool, England, which has been the home of Liverpool since their formation in 1892. The stadium has a seating capacity of 61,276, making it the fifth largest stadium in England. It was originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president.

The stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End. The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952. The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.

Two gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. Both managers have been honoured with statues outside the stadium: Shankly&#x27;s unveiled in 1997 by the Kop Stand and Paisley&#x27;s in 2020 by the Main Stand. The ground is from Liverpool Lime Street railway station.

It was proposed in 2002 for the club to relocate to a new stadium in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool by Fenway Sports Group in 2010, it was made clear this would not happen, with the decision being taken to expand Anfield instead. Construction for an extension to the main stand began on 8 December 2014. This extension, one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football, opened to the public on 9 September 2016, increasing the stadium capacity to 54,074. The Anfield Road Stand redevelopment completed in 2024 increased the stadium capacity to over 61,000.

==History==
The stadium is named after the surrounding area, Anfield. The word originated in the combination of Old and Middle English words, which mean &quot;a field on a slope&quot;. Anfield, and its deviations, has been associated with the area since at least 1642. It has been suggested that the name is linked to the influx of Irish people into the spreading city in the 1850s, and was associated with Annefield, outside New Ross, County Wexford, Ireland. Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally owned by John Orrell, a minor land owner who was a friend of Everton member John Houlding. Everton, who previously played at Priory Road, were in need of a new venue owing to the noise produced by the crowd on match days. Orrell lent the pitch to the club in exchange for a small rent. The first match at the ground was between Everton and Earlestown on 28 September 1884, which Everton won 5–0. During Everton&#x27;s tenure at the stadium, stands were erected for some of the 8,000-plus spectators regularly attending matches, although the ground was capable of holding around 20,000 spectators and occasionally did. The ground was considered of international standard at the time, playing host to the British Home Championship match between England and Ireland in 1889. Anfield&#x27;s first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and Accrington F.C. Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield&#x27;s first league champions in the 1890–91 season.

In 1892, negotiations to purchase the land at Anfield from Orrell escalated into a dispute between Houlding and the Everton committee over how the club was run. Events culminated in Everton&#x27;s move to Goodison Park. Houlding was left with an empty stadium, and decided to form a new club to occupy it. The new team was called Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd, and the club&#x27;s first match at Anfield was a friendly played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against Rotherham Town. Liverpool won 7–1.

Liverpool&#x27;s first Football League match at Anfield was played on 9 September 1893, against Lincoln City. Liverpool won 4–0 in front of 5,000 spectators. A new stand capable of holding 3,000 spectators was constructed in 1895 on the site of the present Main Stand. Designed by architect Archibald Leitch, the stand had a distinctive red and white gable, and was similar to the main stand at Newcastle United&#x27;s ground St James&#x27; Park. Another stand was constructed at the Anfield Road end in 1903, built from timber and corrugated iron. After Liverpool had won their second League championship in 1906, a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot;, named it the Spion Kop; it was named after a famous hill in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War in 1900. More than 300 men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop. Around the same period a stand was also built along Kemlyn Road.

On 14 February 1921, Scouse comedian Harry Weldon invited Dick, Kerr Ladies to Anfield to compete in a match between themselves and a side made up of the best players from the rest of Britain, for The Harry Weldon Cup in aid of unemployed ex-servicemen. Weldon’s side was made up of the best individual players from teams throughout the UK, with one player even travelling from the island of Unst in the Shetland Isles. 25,000 fans were in attendance that day as Dick, Kerr Ladies went on to emphatically win 9-1. The trophy is now on display at the National Football Museum in Manchester.

The ground remained much the same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well. Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield&#x27;s was the largest Kop in the country at the time—it was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds. In the same year the topmast of the , one of the first iron ships, was rescued from the ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still stands there, serving as a flag pole.

Floodlights were installed at a cost of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built at a cost of £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked them for the first time on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club&#x27;s anthem during Shankly&#x27;s time as manager.

Coloured seats and a police room were added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000 seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action. The stand—renamed the Centenary Stand—was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.

On 4 December 1997, a bronze statue of Bill Shankly was unveiled at the visitors&#x27; centre in front of the Kop. Standing at over tall, the statue depicts Shankly with a fan&#x27;s scarf around his neck, in a familiar pose he adopted when receiving applause from fans. Inscribed on the statue are the words &quot;Bill Shankly – He Made The People Happy&quot;. The Hillsborough memorial was situated alongside the Shankly Gates before it was moved next to 97 Avenue in front of the redeveloped main stand in 2016. The memorial is always decorated with flowers and tributes to the 97 people who died as a result of the disaster. At the centre of the memorial is an eternal flame, signifying that those who died will never be forgotten.

In 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has encountered a number of problems since its redevelopment; at the beginning of the 1999–2000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran&#x27;s testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock.

On 30 January 2020, a bronze statue of Bob Paisley was unveiled outside the Main Stand in Paisley Square. The statue was commissioned and donated by the club&#x27;s main sponsor, Standard Chartered, to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of the relationship with the club. The statue is tall and depicts an iconic image of the club&#x27;s history, Paisley carrying future club captain Emlyn Hughes off the field during a match against Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield in April 1968.

==Structures and facilities==
Anfield has 60,725 seats split between four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand. The Anfield Road end and Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is single-tiered and the Main Stand three-tiered. Entry to the stadium is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional staffed turnstile. This system, used in all 80 turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.

Plans to replace Anfield with a new 60,000-capacity stadium in adjacent Stanley Park were initiated in 2002. The plans were revisited under the ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Following the acquisition of Liverpool by Fenway Sports Group (then known as New England Sports Ventures (NESV)) in 2010, the owners abandoned the proposed new stadium in Stanley Park, preferring instead to redevelop and expand Anfield, thus echoing their decision to renovate Fenway Park.
The Kop is a large single-tiered stand. Originally a large terraced banking providing accommodation for more than 30,000 spectators, the current incarnation was constructed in 1994–95 and is single-tiered with no executive boxes. The Kop houses the club&#x27;s museum, the Reducate centre and the official club shop. The Kop is the most-renowned stand at Anfield among home and away supporters, with the people who occupy the stand referred to as &quot;kopites&quot;. Such is the reputation of the stand that it was claimed that the crowd in the Kop could suck the ball into the goal. Traditionally, Liverpool&#x27;s most vocal supporters congregate in this stand.

The oldest stand at Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was completed in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors&#x27; box. The directors&#x27; VIP box is located at the rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier. The players&#x27; tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating &quot;THIS IS ANFIELD&quot;. Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or both hands on it as they passed underneath.

The sign was temporarily removed during the most recent reconstruction of the Main Stand; it was placed at the exit from the new Main Stand tunnel to the pitch in advance of Liverpool&#x27;s 2016–17 home opener. Then-Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had banned players from touching the restored sign until the team had won at least one major trophy. After winning the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final his players were allowed to do so again. Praising the impact the Anfield atmosphere has on the home team and the effect it has on the away team, opposition manager Pep Guardiola stated: &quot;The motto &#x27;This is Anfield&#x27; is no marketing spin. There&#x27;s something about it that you will find in no other stadium in the world.&quot; Following the 2005 Champions League semi-final second leg at Anfield which Liverpool won 1–0, defeated Chelsea manager José Mourinho recognised the role Liverpool fans played on the match: &quot;I felt the power of Anfield, it was magnificent.&quot;

The Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand is a two-tiered stand. Originally a single-tiered stand called the Kemlyn Road Stand, the second tier was added in 1992 to coincide with the club&#x27;s centenary. It is located opposite the Main Stand and houses directors&#x27; boxes, which are between the two tiers. The stand also houses the ground&#x27;s police station. On 3 May 2017, Liverpool announced the Centenary Stand would be renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand in honour of the club&#x27;s greatest servant, former player and manager Kenny Dalglish.

The Anfield Road stand, on the left side of the Main Stand, houses the away fans during matches. The Anfield Road End was rebuilt in 1965, and multi-coloured seats were added in 1982. Originally a single-tier stand, a further revamp, which was completed in 1998, gave the stand a second-tier providing additional seating.

There are 59 spaces available in the stadium to accommodate wheelchair users who have season tickets; a further 33 spaces are available for general sale and 8 are allocated to away supporters. These spaces are located in the Main Stand, Anfield Road Stand and The Kop. There are 38 spaces available for the visually impaired, which are situated in the old paddock area of the Main Stand, with space for one personal assistant each. A headset with full commentary is provided.

The stadium features tributes to two of the club&#x27;s most successful managers. The Paisley Gateway is a tribute to Bob Paisley, who guided Liverpool to three European Cups and six League Championships in the 1970s, and 1980s. The gates were erected at the Kop; their design includes representations of the three European Cups Paisley won during his tenure, the crest of his birthplace in Hetton-le-Hole, and the crest of Liverpool. The Shankly Gates, in tribute of Bill Shankly, Paisley&#x27;s predecessor between 1959 and 1974, are at the Anfield Road end. Their design includes a Scottish flag, a Scottish thistle, the Liverpool badge, and the words &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;.

==Redevelopment==
===Abandoned new stadium plans===


Plans to replace Anfield were originally started by Liverpool in May 2002. The proposed capacity was 55,000, but it was later changed to 61,000, with 1,000 seats given for segregation between home and away fans. Several attempts were made between 2003 and 2007 by the Liverpool City Council to instigate a groundshare of the proposed stadium with local rivals Everton, but this move was rejected, as neither club favoured it. On 30 July 2004 Liverpool was granted planning permission to build a new stadium away from Anfield at Stanley Park. On 8 September 2006, Liverpool City Council agreed to grant the club a 999-year lease of the land on the proposed site.

Following the takeover of Liverpool on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007, the redesigned layout was approved by the council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If the new stadium had been built, Anfield would have been demolished. The land would have become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would have included a hotel, restaurants and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners&#x27; capital, and interest rates were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60 days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500 million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.

===Anfield redevelopment===
The acquisition of Liverpool by Fenway Sports Group in October 2010 put into question whether Liverpool would leave Anfield. In February 2011, the new club owner, John W. Henry, stated he had a preference for staying at Anfield and expanding the capacity. After attending a number of games at Anfield, Henry stated that &quot;the Kop is unrivalled&quot;, adding &quot;it would be hard to replicate that feeling anywhere else&quot;.
On 15 October 2012, Liverpool City Council announced plans to regenerate the Anfield area after securing a £25m grant, with a housing association also set to invest.

On 23 August 2013, Anfield was listed as an Asset of Community Value by Liverpool City Council. On 11 September, current owner John W. Henry announced that they had the funds to afford the expansion, but they are waiting for the City Council to finalise the purchase of houses in the area before they commit to plans to expand the Main Stand and the Anfield Road end of the ground.
In April 2014, Liverpool signed a legal agreement with Liverpool City Council and Your Housing Group to redevelop the surrounding Anfield area. This was seen as a significant step towards the renovation of the stadium. The redevelopment was worth around £260 million.

====Phase one (2015–16): Main Stand redevelopment====
In April 2014, Liverpool revealed plans for an expansion of the Main Stand, which involved adding a new third tier, new matchday facilities and enhanced corporate facilities. The new stand would add 8,500 seats and take the capacity of the stadium to 54,742. Construction of the new Main Stand was made possible by the complete demolition of all the houses in Lothair Road as well as some of those on neighbouring Alroy Road and Anfield Road. Liverpool had started to purchase housing immediately surrounding Anfield in 2000. The houses were left empty, including at least 22 in the roads backing onto the main stand, and Liverpool were accused of deliberately allowing the area to become blighted, thus depressing the property prices.
Work began on 8 December 2014, with the club aiming for the new stand to be match-ready and operational for the start of the 2016–17 season. The work was undertaken by Carillion. The structure of new stand was uniquely constructed around the existing main stand to enable the existing stand to continue to be used at full operational capacity during the 2015–16 season. Demolition of the existing stand took place in summer 2016, allowing for the construction of the lower tiers of the new stand during the off-season. Consisting of 1.8 million bricks and blocks and over 5000 tonnes of steel, the stand was opened on schedule on 9 September 2016 for the first home game of the 2016–17 season, a 4–1 victory over Leicester City. Further internal construction work including new changing rooms and media facilities continued until April 2017.

====New club superstore and matchday experience enhancements (2016–17)====
In May 2016, outline planning permission was granted by Liverpool council for the construction of a new 1,800 sq m club superstore development, situated on Walton Breck Road on the corner of the Kop and the new Main Stand. Construction began in December 2016, with the store opening early in the 2017–18 season. The space between the new store and the stadium was developed into a &quot;fan zone&quot;, with new catering outlets and pre-match entertainment.

====Phase two (2021–24): Anfield Road End redevelopment====

The second phase of Anfield&#x27;s redevelopment was to redevelop the Anfield Road stand. The club received initial outline planning permission in 2014 for the redevelopment, with seating to be increased by 4,825, giving Anfield a total capacity of 58,000. However, in August 2019, Liverpool allowed the planning permission associated with the original 2014 designs to lapse, confirming their intention to submit &quot;ambitious new plans&quot; for the Anfield Road End redevelopment which are believed to increase the capacity further to take the overall capacity of Anfield to comfortably above 60,000. The redevelopment focused on the upper tier of the stand, with the lower tier remaining unchanged. Construction work was completed behind the existing stand and then connected to the lower tier, which was expected to be in the 2022 off-season. Therefore, Anfield&#x27;s capacity was not expected to be affected throughout the duration of the works.

The club spent the second half of 2019 finalising plans and consulting local residents, planning officials and other stakeholders with a view to submitting the new plans for approval in early 2020. However, in March 2020, Liverpool delayed submitting a planning application for the project, in light of financial uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, Liverpool announced that they would be moving forward with the project by submitting final planning application for the redevelopment, with the delay pushing back the initial completion date for Phase Two redevelopment from summer 2022 to summer 2023 at the earliest. The plans were approved by the Liverpool City Council in June 2021. The expansion was expected to cost £60 million and allowed Anfield Road stand to seat 7,000 more people, giving the stadium a total capacity of 61,000.

Work by contractor Buckingham Group officially commenced on 30 September 2021, with the first sod being turned by manager Jürgen Klopp. The stand was expected to be completed during the 2023–24 season and would also see the relocation of the Family Park to a covered position. However, on 17 August 2023, Buckingham announced it would be filing for administration, jeopardising timely completion of the new £80 million stand. On 7 September 2023, the club took control of the project, appointing Rayner Rowen Construction to complete the stand using as many of the original subcontractors as possible. In October 2023, Liverpool announced that the upper part of the new developed stand would not be open to the public &quot;until the end of 2023&quot;. On 23 November, the club anticipated half of the new upper tier would be available for a Premier League match against Manchester United on 17 December 2023. Much of the stand opened for Liverpool&#x27;s home Premier League game against Burnley on 10 February 2024.

==Other uses==
===International football and Liverpool Women===
Anfield has hosted numerous international matches, and was one of the venues used during UEFA Euro 1996; the ground hosted three group games and a quarter-final. The first international match hosted at Anfield was between England and Ireland, in 1889. England won the match 6–1. Anfield was also the home venue for several of England&#x27;s international football matches in the early 1900s, and for the Welsh national team in the later part of that century. Anfield has also played host to five FA Cup semi-finals, the last of which was in 1929. The most recent international to be hosted at Anfield was England&#x27;s 2–1 victory over Uruguay on 1 March 2006. The close proximity of the stands to the pitch prevents the club from extending the pitch to suit UEFA&#x27;s parameter requirements; since 2006, the stadium has been ineligible to host England games, Champions League and Europa League finals, and UEFA tournaments (UEFA Euro 2028). 

England has played two testimonial matches against Liverpool at Anfield. The first was in 1983, when England faced Liverpool for Phil Thompson&#x27;s testimonial. Then, in 1988, England visited again for Alan Hansen&#x27;s testimonial. Liverpool&#x27;s arch rival Manchester United played their first home game of the 1971–72 season at Anfield as they were banned from playing their first two home league matches at Old Trafford after an incident of hooliganism. United beat Arsenal 3–1.

In November 2019, Anfield hosted a Women&#x27;s Super League fixture for the first time, with the 6th matchday of the 2019–20 season featuring the Merseyside Derby between Liverpool Women and local rivals Everton Women. On 25 September 2022, Anfield played host to second Merseyside Derby between two women&#x27;s first teams in the Women&#x27;s Super League. Played before a record attendance of 27,574 for a Liverpool game for their women’s first team, it was also the first women&#x27;s Merseyside Derby to be televised. This attendance would go on to become the 7th highest attendance of the 2022–23 season. On 22 August 2023, it was announced that Anfield would host a third women&#x27;s Merseyside Derby on 15 October 2023.

===Rugby league===
The stadium has hosted five rugby league matches: the 1989 Charity Shield between Widnes and Wigan; the 1991 World Club Challenge between Wigan, winners of the RFL Championship, and Penrith Panthers, winners of the Australian NSWRL Premiership, with an attendance of 20,152; a 1997 St. Helens Super League home game against Castleford Tigers, with an attendance of 12,329; and the 2016 Rugby League Four Nations Final, in front of 40,042 people.

Anfield was chosen as the venue for the 2019 Magic Weekend after two test matches were played there in 2016 and 2018. After previously choosing games that were local derbies or competitive games, in 2019 the fixtures were determined by the previous seasons league position. Robert Elstone, Super League Chief Executive, said “On behalf of the Super League clubs, we’re delighted to be taking the Dacia Magic Weekend to one of the most famous stadiums in the world.

===Other sports===
Anfield has been the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the finishing line for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George&#x27;s plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield. Boxing matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the Harlem Globetrotters was held at the ground.

===Non sporting events===
Aside from sporting uses, Anfield has been a venue for musicians of different genres as well as evangelical preachers. One week in July 1984, the American evangelist Billy Graham preached at Anfield, attracting crowds of over 30,000 each night. Anfield was featured in Liverpool&#x27;s 2008 European Capital of Culture celebrations: 36,000 people attended a concert on 1 June 2008, featuring The Zutons, Kaiser Chiefs and Paul McCartney. Live concerts made a return to Anfield in the summer of 2019, with Take That, Bon Jovi and Pink performing. Take That lead singer Gary Barlow, a Liverpool fan, brought out a guest vocalist, Gerry Marsden, and they sang the club&#x27;s anthem “You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone”. Artists who played at the stadium in summer 2022 include Elton John, The Rolling Stones and The Eagles. Taylor Swift played three consecutive dates at the stadium, featuring Paramore as special guests, from 13 to 15 June 2024 as part of her Eras Tour.

==Records==
The highest sporting attendance recorded at Anfield is 61,905, for Liverpool&#x27;s match against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup fifth round, on 2 February 1952. Since the Anfield Road end was expanded, Liverpool have seen bigger league attendances, and their most recent was 60,420 against Ipswich Town on 25 January 2025. The highest non-sporting attendance at Anfield was recorded during a Taylor Swift concert in June 2024 with over 62,000 in attendance. The lowest attendance recorded at Anfield was 1,000 for a match against Loughborough on 7 December 1895. The highest average attendance of 53,112 was set for the 2016–17 season. 

Liverpool did not lose a league match at Anfield during the 1893–94, 1970–71, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, 1987–88, 2008–09, 2017–18, 2018–19, 2019–20 and 2021–22 seasons. Liverpool&#x27;s longest unbeaten streak at home extended from January 1978 to January 1981, a period encompassing 85 games, in which Liverpool scored 212 goals and conceded 35. The club&#x27;s longest unbeaten home run in the league is 68 games, which occurred from April 2017 to January 2021. Liverpool&#x27;s worst losing streak at Anfield is six games in 2020–2021 with games played behind closed doors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The most consecutive league wins at Anfield is 24, this is the longest run in English top-flight history. It was accomplished across the 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons.

==Transport==
The stadium is about from Lime Street Station, which lies on a branch of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston. Kirkdale Station, about from the stadium, is the nearest station to Anfield. Fans travelling by train for matches may book direct to Anfield or Goodison Park, changing to the Peoplesbus Soccerbus service at Sandhills Station on the Merseyrail Northern Line. The stadium has no parking facilities for supporters, and the streets around the ground allow parking only for residents with permits, although there are a small number of passes that can be allocated to over-65s. There are proposals under consideration for reinstating passenger traffic on the Bootle Branch, which would cut the distance from the nearest railway station to about .

<text>UP Health System - Marquette (formerly Marquette General Hospital) is an American hospital and regional medical center located in Marquette, serving the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. UPHS Marquette is a Level II trauma center and a teaching hospital, affiliated with the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. 

In 2012, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette approved Marquette General Hospital&#x27;s purchase by for-profit organization Duke LifePoint, a joint venture of Duke University Health System and LifePoint Health.

== History ==

=== St. Mary&#x27;s and St. Luke&#x27;s ===
Prior to 1973, Marquette had two hospitals: St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital and St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital. St. Mary&#x27;s was founded by the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis of Iowa City in 1890, serving local loggers and mariners. St. Mary&#x27;s moved into a new building in 1955, whose ownership passed to the State of Michigan after its merger with St. Luke&#x27;s. The old St. Mary&#x27;s building has housed the D.J. Jacobetti Home for Veterans since 1981.

St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, the predecessor to the Marquette General Hospital campus, opened in 1915, succeeding the already-outgrown Marquette City Hospital of 1896. St. Luke&#x27;s expanded steadily through the early and mid-20th century, adding pediatric services, a nursing school, and an intensive care unit.

=== Marquette General Hospital ===
Marquette General Hospital was formed in 1973 by the merger of St. Mary&#x27;s and St. Luke&#x27;s. Marquette General continued to expand the former St. Luke&#x27;s campus, adding more services for the growing population of the region. MGH remained a non-profit hospital, and was the largest employer in the City of Marquette.

Marquette General Hospital was certified as a level II trauma center in 2005, the only such hospital in the Upper Peninsula. Simultaneously, MGH faced serious financial difficulties, with long-term debts of $60million and pension liabilities of $100million. A 2007 plan for a financial turnaround was insufficient, which led to proposals to sell the hospital as early as 2010. 

Following a review by the Michigan Attorney General&#x27;s office, the sale of Marquette General Hospital to Duke LifePoint was approved in 2012. The Marquette General Foundation, formerly the hospital&#x27;s charitable foundation, was required to be separated from the hospital&#x27;s operations, and now operates as the Superior Health Foundation. The terms of the purchase agreement with Duke LifePoint included an investment of $300million in capital improvements, $50million towards physician recruitment, and a $23million contribution to the Superior Health Foundation.

=== UP Health System Marquette ===
Upon its purchase of Marquette General Hospital, Duke LifePoint renamed the hospital to UP Health System - Marquette. In 2014, Duke LifePoint announced plans for a new hospital building, located on West Baraga Avenue, to replace the Marquette General Hospital campus. The construction of the new hospital was funded by Duke LifePoint, as required by the purchase agreement. 

The new UP Health System Marquette opened in 2019, with most services moving to the new building. , some services remain on the old Marquette General Hospital campus, which is scheduled to be fully vacated by early 2024. The property was sold to the Northern Michigan University Foundation for $1, and is slated for redevelopment.

UPHS Marquette is the center of UP Health System, a three-hospital network in the Upper Peninsula operated by Duke LifePoint. UP Health System - Portage is centered on a 36-bed Level III trauma center in Hancock, providing services throughout the Copper Country. UP Health System - Bell, formerly Bell Memorial Hospital, is the Ishpeming affiliate of UPHS.

<text>Gregory Bruce Jarvis (August 24, 1944 – January 28, 1986) was an American engineer and astronaut who died during the January 28, 1986 destruction of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; on mission STS-51-L, where he was serving as payload specialist for Hughes Aircraft.

==Education==
Jarvis graduated from Mohawk Central High School (later renamed to Gregory B. Jarvis High School, which eventually became the Gregory B. Jarvis Middle School in his honor), in Mohawk, New York, in 1962. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1967, and a Master of Science degree in the same discipline from Northeastern University two years later. Jarvis joined the United States Air Force the same year and served until 1973, when he was honorably discharged as a Captain. Thereafter, Jarvis worked for Hughes Aircraft.

==Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster==
In June 1984, Jarvis was one of two Hughes Aircraft employees selected as candidates for the Space Shuttle program. He planned to conduct experiments regarding the effects of weightlessness on fluids. Jarvis was initially scheduled to make his shuttle flight in April 1985, but Jarvis was replaced on that flight by U.S. senator Jake Garn. Jarvis&#x27; flight was rescheduled for early January 1986, but he was again replaced – this time by U.S. representative Bill Nelson.

Jarvis was payload specialist 2 on STS-51-L which was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 11:38:00 EST on January 28, 1986. The crew on board the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; included Commander Dick Scobee, pilot Michael J. Smith (USN), mission specialists Dr. Ronald McNair, Lt. Col. Ellison Onizuka (USAF), Dr. Judith Resnik, and fellow civilian payload specialist Christa McAuliffe. The entire STS-51-L crew died when &quot;Challenger&quot; broke up during launch.

The remains of all seven astronauts from the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster were discovered in the crew decks on the ocean floor. Jarvis&#x27; body was discovered in the lower mid-deck along with McNair and McAuliffe. During salvage operations to raise the crew deck from the ocean floor, Jarvis&#x27; body escaped from the wreckage, floated to the surface, and disappeared back into the sea. On April 15, 1986, on the last scheduled attempt to recover wreckage, his body was rediscovered and returned to shore. Jarvis was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean.

==Awards and honors==
The East Engineering building on University at Buffalo (SUNY) north campus was renamed Jarvis Hall after Jarvis&#x27; death. In Spring 1986, when the university had not yet named the building in his memory, four students scaled the building and nailed a sign with the name &quot;Jarvis Hall&quot; onto the side of the building as a show of support for the deceased astronaut. The four students were Keith “Vedge” Tannenbaum, Space Mann, Little Jeffrey Brenner and Joseph “Sneetch” Kuperberg. The students purchased plywood and stencils at a local store and then painted the sign before going out late at night to attach it to the building. In 1987, the name was made official with a dedication ceremony. Jarvis Hall is devoted largely to Aerospace Engineering and engineering support services.

In 1988, a crater on Earth&#x27;s moon was named for Jarvis. 

Mohawk Central High School in Mohawk, New York was renamed Gregory B. Jarvis Jr/Sr High School. It is now the Gregory B. Jarvis Middle School of the Central Valley Central School District.
A sculpture by SUNY at Buffalo faculty member emeritus Tony Paterson entitled &quot;Jarvis Memorial&quot; was commissioned by SUNY at Buffalo to honor Jarvis and is currently in the SUNY at Buffalo art collection.

Jarvis was portrayed by Richard Jenkins in the 1990 TV movie &quot;Challenger&quot;.

In 2004, Jarvis was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor.

The hydropower-producing dam on Hinckley Lake, New York, operated by the New York Power Authority, is named the Gregory B. Jarvis Dam.

<doc id="178257" wikidata="Q1345478" url="?curid=178257" title="Richard Simon (priest)">
<text>Richard Simon CO (13 May 1638 – 11 April 1712), was a French priest, a member of the Oratorians, who was an influential biblical critic, orientalist and controversialist.

==Early years==
Simon was born at Dieppe. His early education took place at the Oratorian college there, and a benefice enabled him to study theology at Paris, where he showed an interest in Hebrew and other Oriental languages. He entered the Oratorians as novice in 1662. At the end of his novitiate he was sent to teach philosophy at the College of Juilly. But he was soon recalled to Paris, and employed in preparing a catalogue of the Oriental books in the library of the Oratory.

==Conflicts as Oratorian==
Simon was ordained a priest in 1670. He then taught rhetoric at Juilly until 1673, having among his students the noted philosopher, Count Henri de Boulainvilliers.

Simon was influenced by the ideas of Isaac La Peyrère who came to live with the Oratorians (though taking little of the specifics), and by Baruch Spinoza. Simon&#x27;s approach earned him the later recognition as a &quot;Father of the higher criticism&quot;, though this title is also given to German writers of the following century, as well as to Spinoza himself. Simon had a friend who was Jewish and a follower of Sabbatai Zevi, and tried to have La Peyrere talk to him, but he showed no interest.

Simon aroused ill will when he strayed into a legal battle. François Verjus was a fellow Oratorian and friend who was acting against the Benedictines of Fécamp Abbey on behalf of their commendatory abbot, the Prince de Neubourg. Simon composed a strongly worded memorandum, and the monks complained to the Abbé Abel-Louis de Sainte-Marthe, Provost General of the Oratory from 1672. The charge of Jesuitism was also brought against Simon, on the grounds that his friend&#x27;s brother, Father Antoine Verjus, was a prominent member of the Society of Jesus.

==Suppression of the &quot;Histoire critique&quot;==
At the time of the printing of Simon&#x27;s &quot;Histoire critique du Vieux Testament&quot;, the work passed the censorship of the University of Paris, and the Chancellor of the Oratory gave his &quot;imprimatur&quot;. Simon hoped, through the influence of the Jesuit priest, François de la Chaise, the king&#x27;s confessor, and Charles de Sainte-Maure, duc de Montausier, to be allowed to dedicate the work to King Louis XIV of France; but the king was absent in Flanders.

The freedom with which Simon expressed himself, especially when he declared that Moses could not be the author of much in the writings attributed to him, gained attention. The influence of Jacques-Benigne Bossuet, at that time tutor to the Dauphin of France, was invoked; the chancellor, Michael le Tellier, lent his assistance. A decree of the Royal Council was obtained, and, after a series of intrigues, the whole printing, consisting of 1,300 copies, was seized by the police and destroyed.

==Later life==
The Oratory then expelled Simon (1678). He retired in 1679 to the curacy of Bolleville, Seine-Maritime. He later returned to Dieppe, where much of his library was lost in the naval bombardment of 1694. He died there on 11 April 1712, at the age of seventy-four.

==Works==
Most of what Simon wrote in biblical criticism was not new, given the work of previous critics such as Louis Cappel, Johannes Morinus, and others. The Jesuit tradition of biblical criticism starting with Alfonso Salmeron had paved the way for his approach.

===Old Testament===
The &quot;Histoire critique du Vieux Testament&quot; (1678) consists of three books. The first deals with the text of the Hebrew Bible and the changes which it has undergone, and the authorship of the Mosaic writings and of other books of the Bible. It presents Simon&#x27;s theory of the existence during early Jewish history of recorders or annalists of the events of each period, whose writings were preserved in the public archives. The second book gives an account of the main translations, ancient and modern, of the Old Testament. The third discusses biblical commentators. The book had a complicated early development. It appeared, with Simon&#x27;s name on the title page, in the year 1685, from the press of Reinier Leers in Rotterdam. This Dutch edition, in fact the second, superseded the suppressed French first edition, but differed from it in a number of ways. Simon had hoped to overcome the opposition of Bossuet by making changes; these negotiations with Bossuet lasted a considerable time, but finally broke down.

The original French printer of the book, in order to promote sales, had the titles of the chapters printed separately and circulated. These had come into the hands of the Port Royalists, who had undertaken a translation into French of the &quot;Prolegomena&quot; to Brian Walton&#x27;s &quot;Polyglott&quot;. To counteract this, Simon announced his intention of publishing an annotated edition of the &quot;Prolegomena&quot;, and added to the &quot;Histoire critique&quot; a translation of the last four chapters of that work, not part of his original plan. Simon&#x27;s announcement prevented the appearance of the projected translation.

A faulty edition of the &quot;Histoire critique&quot; had previously been published at Amsterdam by Daniel Elzevir, based on a manuscript transcription of one of the copies of the original work which had been sent to England; and from which a Latin translation (&quot;Historia critica Veteris Testamenti&quot;, 1681, by Noël Aubert de Versé) and an English translation (&quot;Critical History of the Old Testament&quot;, London, 1682) were made. The edition of Leers was a reproduction of the work as first printed, with a new preface, notes, and those other writings which had appeared for and against the work up to that date; it included Simon&#x27;s answers to criticisms of Charles de Veil and Friedrich Spanheim the Younger.

===New Testament===
In 1689 appeared Simon&#x27;s companion &quot;Histoire critique du texte du Nouveau Testament&quot;, consisting of thirty-three chapters. In it he discusses: the origin and character of the various books, with a consideration of the objections brought against them by the Jews and others; the quotations from the Old Testament in the New; the inspiration of the New Testament (with a refutation of the opinions of Baruch Spinoza); the Greek dialect in which they are written (against Claudius Salmasius); and the Greek manuscripts known at the time, especially &quot;Codex Bezae&quot; (Cantabrigiensis).

There followed in 1690 his &quot;Histoire critique des versions du Nouveau Testament&quot;, where he gives an account of the various translations, both ancient and modern, and discusses the way in which difficult passages of the New Testament have been rendered in the various versions. In 1693 was published the &quot;Histoire critique des principaux commentateurs du Nouveau Testament depuis le commencement du Christianisme jusques a notre tems&quot;. &quot;Nouvelles Observations sur le texte et les versions du Nouveau Testament&quot; (Paris, 1695) contains supplementary observations on the subjects of the text and translations of the New Testament.

In 1702 Simon published at Trévoux his own translation into French of the New Testament (the &quot;version de Trévoux&quot;). It was substantially based on the Latin Vulgate, but was annotated in such a way as to cast doubt on traditional readings that were backed by Church authority. Again Bossuet did what he could to suppress the work. Despite changes over two decades in how Bossuet was able to exert influence through his circle of contacts, he again mobilised against Simon beyond the boundaries of his diocese.

===Other works===
As a controversialist, Simon tended to use pseudonyms, and to display bitterness.

Simon was early at odds with the Port-Royalists. Antoine Arnauld had compiled with others a work &quot;Perpétuité de la foi&quot; (On the Perpetuity of the Faith), the first volume of which dealt with the Eucharist. After François Diroys, who knew both of them, had involved Simon in commenting on the work, Simon&#x27;s criticisms from 1669 aroused indignation in Arnauld&#x27;s camp.

Simon&#x27;s first major publication followed, his &quot;Fides Ecclesiae orientalis, seu Gabrielis Metropolitae Philadelphiensis opuscula, cum interpretatione Latina, cum notis&quot; (Paris, 1671), on a work of Gabriel Severus (1541–1616), the object of which was to demonstrate that the belief of the Greek Church regarding the Eucharist was the same as that of the Church of Rome. In 1670 he had written a pamphlet in defence of the Jews of Metz, who had been accused of having murdered a Christian child.

Simon published in 1675 a translation of the travels of Girolamo Dandini in Lebanon, as &quot;Voyage au Mont Liban&quot; (1675). Dandini was a perceptive observer, and Simon in his preface argued for the utility of travel to theologians.

In 1676 contacts with Huguenots at Charenton led Simon to circulate a manuscript project for a new version of the Bible. This was a sample for a proposed improved edition of the Giovanni Diodati translation; but after Simon had translated the Pentateuch the funding ran out.

===Reception===
The &quot;Histoire critique du Vieux Testament&quot; encountered strong opposition from Catholics who disliked Simon&#x27;s diminishing of the authority of the Church Fathers. Protestants widely felt that an infallible Bible was threatened by doubts which Simon raised against the integrity of the Hebrew text; and indeed Simon as basic tenets argued against &quot;sola scriptura&quot; and in favour of the Catholic Church tradition of interpretation. Jean Le Clerc, in his 1685 work &quot;Sentimens de quelques théologiens de Hollande&quot;, controverted the views of Simon acutely, and claimed that an uninformed reader might take Simon to be any of a Calvinist, Jew or crypto-Spinozan; Bossuet made a point of banning this also, as even more harmful than Simon&#x27;s book. It was answered in &quot;Réponse aux Sentimens de quelques théologiens de Hollande&quot; by Simon (1686).

In France, Simon&#x27;s work became well known and widely circulated, despite Bossuet&#x27;s hostility and efforts to keep it marginal. Étienne Fourmont was in effect a disciple of Simon, if not acknowledging the fact. Another orientalist influenced by Simon was Nicolas Barat. An important eighteenth century biblical critic in France that did use Simon&#x27;s work on the Hebrew Bible was Jean Astruc.

The identity of the translator of the 1682 English version &quot;Critical History of the Old Testament&quot; is unclear, being often given as a Henry Dickinson who is an obscure figure, and sometimes as John Hampden; John Dryden wrote his &quot;Religio Laici&quot; in response with a dedication to Dickinson, and Simon&#x27;s work became well known. Isaac Newton took an interest in Simon&#x27;s New Testament criticism in the early 1690s, pointed out to him by John Locke, adding from it to an Arian summary of his views that was intended for publication by Le Clerc, but remained in manuscript. Later Samuel Clarke published his &quot;The Divine Authority of the Holy Scriptures Asserted&quot; (1699) in reply to Simon. Simon&#x27;s works were later an influence on Johann Salomo Semler.

Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s 1897 catalogue of condemned books contains several works by Richard Simon.

<text>A UN number (United Nations number) is a four-digit number that identifies hazardous materials, and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.) in the framework of international trade and transport. Some hazardous substances have their own UN numbers (e.g. acrylamide has UN 2074), while sometimes groups of chemicals or products with similar properties receive a common UN number (e.g. flammable liquids, not otherwise specified, have UN 1993). A chemical in its solid state may receive a different UN number than the liquid phase if its hazardous properties differ significantly; substances with different levels of purity (or concentration in solution) may also receive different UN number

==Hazard identifiers==
Associated with each UN number is a hazard identifier, which encodes the general hazard class and subdivision (and, in the case of explosives, their compatibility group). If a substance poses several dangers, then subsidiary risk identifiers may be specified. It is not possible to deduce the hazard class(es) of a substance from its UN number: they have to be looked up in a table.

==Range==
UN numbers range from UN 0004 to about UN 3550 (UN 0001 – UN 0003 are no longer in use) and are assigned by the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. They are published as part of their &quot;Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods&quot;, also known as the &quot;Orange Book&quot;. These recommendations are adopted by the regulatory organization responsible for the different modes of transport. There is no UN number allocated to non-hazardous substances.

==Non-UN identifiers==
An NA number (North America number) is issued by the United States Department of Transportation and is identical to UN numbers, except that some substances without a UN number may have an NA number. These additional NA numbers use the range NA 9000 - NA 9279. There are some exceptions, for example, NA 2212 is all asbestos with UN 2212 limited to asbestos, amphibole amosite, tremolite, actinolite, anthophyllite, or crocidolite. Another exception, NA 3334, is self-defense spray, non-pressurized while UN 3334 is aviation-regulated liquid, not otherwise specified. For the complete list, see NA/UN exceptions.

An ID number is a third type of identification number used for hazardous substances being offered for air transport. Substances with an ID number are associated with proper shipping names recognized by the ICAO Technical Instructions. ID 8000, Consumer commodity does not have a UN or NA number, and is classed as a Class 9 hazardous material.

<doc id="178260" wikidata="Q705309" url="?curid=178260" title="Louis Cappel">
<text>Louis Cappel (15 October 1585 – 18 June 1658) was a French Protestant churchman and scholar. A Huguenot, he was born at St Elier, near Sedan. He studied theology at the Academy of Sedan and the Academy of Saumur, and Arabic at the University of Oxford, where he spent two years. At the age of twenty-eight, he accepted the chair of Hebrew at Saumur and, twenty years later, was appointed professor of theology. Amongst his fellow lecturers were Moses Amyraut and Josué de la Place.

== Writings on the Hebrew Biblical text ==

As a Hebrew scholar Cappel made a special study of the history of the Hebrew Masoretic text of the Bible, which led him to the conclusion that the vowel points and accents are not an original part of the Hebrew language, but had been inserted by the Masorete Jews, no earlier than the 5th century; he also concluded that the primitive Hebrew characters are those now known as the Samaritan, while the square characters are Aramaic and were substituted for the more ancient at the time of the Babylonian captivity. He published his conclusions anonymously, but with the express support of Thomas van Erpe, in his book &quot;Arcanum punctuationis revelatum&quot; (Leiden, 1624).

Cappel&#x27;s views were not a complete novelty. Nearly a century earlier, Elias Levita (1469–1549) demonstrated in 1538 that neither Jerome nor the Talmud showed any acquaintance with the vowel points, a comparatively recent Jewish invention. In response to the claim that Protestants, in spite of their claim to follow nothing but Scripture alone (&quot;sola scriptura&quot;), were thus dependent in reality on Jewish tradition, many Protestants declared that the vowel points were in fact ancient and an essential part of the divinely inspired Scripture. Foremost among the upholders of this view were Johannes Buxtorf senior and his son Johannes Buxtorf II.

In 1634 Cappel had already completed work on a second important work, &quot;Critica sacra: sive de variis quae in sacris Veteris Testamenti libris occurrunt lectionibus&quot; (Sacred Criticism: Variant Readings in the Books of the Old Testament), but because of the fierce opposition of his co-religionists was able to print it only in 1650, by aid of a son, who had turned Catholic (according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition) or (according to Michael C. Legaspi in 2010) of the Catholic priest-scholar Jean Morin.

In this book, Cappel not only raised questions about the age of the vowel points in the Hebrew Bible: he denied that even the surviving consonantal Hebrew text preserved the autographs of scripture. He distinguished between the divinely inspired content of Scripture and the wholly human process of its transmission in texts that are produced by human hands with variants due above all to scribal errors and that need emendation with the help of the versions and of conjecture. The variant readings in the text and the differences between the ancient versions and the Masoretic text convinced him that the idea of the integrity of the Hebrew text, as commonly held by Protestants, was untenable. This amounted to an attack on the verbal inspiration of Scripture. Bitter, however, as was the opposition to his views, it was not long before his results were accepted by scholars.

Crawford Howell Toy and Karl Heinrich Cornill state in &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;: &quot;It is to the lasting credit of Cappel that he was the first who dared to undertake, with exemplary clearness, penetration, and method, a purely philologic and scientific treatment of the text of the Bible.&quot;

== Other writings ==

Cappel was also the author of &quot;Annotationes et commentarii in Vetus Testamentum&quot; and other biblical works, as well as of several other treatises on Hebrew, among which are the &quot;Diatribe de veris et antiquis Ebraeorum literis&quot; (1645). His &quot;Commentarius de Capellorum gente&quot;, giving an account of the Cappel family to which he belonged, was published by his nephew James Cappel (1639–1722), who, at the age of eighteen, became professor of Hebrew at Saumur, but, on the revocation of the edict of Nantes, fled to England.

Suleri was born in Karachi, Dominion of Pakistan (now Pakistan), one of six children, to a Welsh mother, Mair Jones, an English professor, and a Pakistani father, Z. A. Suleri (1913–1999), a notable political journalist, conservative writer, author, and the Pakistan Movement activist regarded as one of the pioneers of print journalism in Pakistan, and authored various history and political books on Pakistan as well as Islam in the Indian subcontinent.

She had her early education in London and attended secondary school in Lahore. She received her B.A. at Kinnaird College, also in Lahore, in 1974. Two years later, she was awarded an M.A. from Punjab University, and went on to graduate with a PhD from Indiana University in 1983.

==Career and major works==
Suleri taught for two years at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, before she moved to Yale and began teaching there in 1983. Suleri was a founding editor of the &quot;Yale Journal of Criticism&quot;.

Suleri&#x27;s 1989 memoir, &quot;Meatless Days&quot;, is an exploration of the complex interweaving of national history and personal biography which was widely and respectfully reviewed. An edition of the book, with an introduction by Kamila Shamsie, was published in the Penguin Women Writers series in 2018.

Her 1992 &quot;The Rhetoric of English India&quot; was well received in scholarly circles. One critic, for instance, said recent scholarship by Edward Said, Homi Bhabha, Gauri Viswanathan, and Jacques Derrida has &quot;reformulated the paradigmatic assumptions of colonial cultural studies&quot;, and the book was an &quot;important addition to such scholarship&quot;. The &quot;unconventionality of some of her selections brings a breath of fresh air to a field prone to turn, time and again, to the same weary list of standard texts.&quot; However, an historian took Suleri to task for the &quot;casual manner in which she forms important generalizations without benefit of hard data&quot;. He concludes, that &quot;This is not to say that Suleri&#x27;s work is totally without substance or that all of her insights are without value. No doubt, she is a sensitive literary critic who would be bored with the kind of detailed monographs historians and ethnographic anthropologists do as a matter of course.&quot;

&quot;Boys Will Be Boys: A Daughter&#x27;s Elegy&quot; was published in 2003. The book is a tribute to her father, the political journalist Z. A. Suleri, who was known as Pip for his &quot;patriotic and preposterous disposition&quot;. It also incorporates the story of Suleri&#x27;s marriage to her husband.

Henry Louis Gates Jr. has described Suleri as &quot;a postcolonial Proust to Rushdie&#x27;s phantasmagorical Pynchon.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1993, Suleri married Austin Goodyear (c. 1920–2005) of the Goodyear family. Goodyear had three children from his first marriage to Louisa Robins (1920–1992), the granddaughter of Thomas Robins Jr; the eldest, Grace Rumsey Goodyear (b. 1941), is married to Franklin D. Roosevelt III (b. 1938), the grandson of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt.

Suleri and Goodyear remained married until his death on August 14, 2005. Goodyear died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on March 20, 2022, at her home in Bellingham, Washington, at the age of 68.

<text>Horten () is a municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Jarlsberg. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Horten. Other population centers in Horten Municipality include the town of Åsgårdstrand and the villages of Nykirke, Skoppum, and Borre. The municipality is located on a peninsula along the Ytre Oslofjord.

The municipality is the 340th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Horten is the 42nd most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 27,682. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 4.1% over the previous 10-year period.

Borre National Park contains the largest known burial site in Scandinavia. It also has the largest collection of king&#x27;s graves in Scandinavia.

The local newspaper in Horten is named , and covers mostly local news. The Bastøy Prison is located on the island of Bastøy which is located in the Ytre Oslofjord and is part of the municipality of Horten.

==General information==

The small port town of Horten was established as a municipality on 1 January 1858 after it was separated from Borre Municipality (because it had been designated a ladested which meant it had to be a separate urban municipality and no longer part of the larger rural municipality). Initially, it had a population of 4,636. On 1 August 1921, an area of Borre Municipality (population: 287) was transferred into the town of Horten. On 1 July 1951, another area of Borre Municipality (population: 308) was transferred into the town of Horten.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the town of Åsgårdstrand (population: 488) and the Stang area of Sem Municipality (population: 126) were both merged with Borre Municipality (population: 6,037). On 1 January 1986, an area of Borre Municipality (population: 22) was transferred into the town of Horten. On 1 January 1988, the neighboring Borre Municipality (population: 12,994) was merged with Horten Municipality (population: 9,098). Prior to the merger, Horten Municipality was the same as the town of Horten, but afterwards, the municipality was much larger than the town. The name of the new municipality was somewhat controversial and the government chose &quot;Borre&quot; over &quot;Horten&quot; for the new name. On 1 June 2002, the name of the municipality was changed (back) to Horten, following a referendum held in conjunction with the 2001 parliamentary election. The referendum was a close call with 6,557 votes for the name Horten and 6,218 votes for Borre. 

===Name===
The municipality (originally the town) is named after the old &quot;Horten&quot; farm (spelled &quot;Hortan&quot; in 1552) since the town was built on the old farm site. The name has an uncertain meaning. The name may come from a local dialect word which means the &quot;outer, knotty bark on older trees&quot; which likely derives from the Old Norse word which means &quot;something uneven&quot; or &quot;wrinkled&quot;. Another option could be that it is derived from the Old Norse word or which means &quot;rocky ground&quot;, &quot;shelter&quot;, or &quot;place of refuge&quot;. yet another option is that it could be the definite form of &quot;hort&quot; which can mean &quot;bulge&quot; (). Several hills and mountains in Norway have the name &quot;Horten&quot; or &quot;Horta&quot; and here it could be referring to the Brårudåsen hill lying in the middle of the town. 

From 1 January 1988 until 1 June 2002, this municipality was named &quot;Borre&quot;. See Borre Municipality#Name.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 19 November 1907, just after Horten was designated as a kjøpstad, giving it town privileges. The blazon is &quot;Per bend azure a fortress and boat on water and argent a rose&quot;. This means the arms are divided with a diagonal line. The field (background) below the line shows a naval fort with a boat on the water. Above the line, there is a red rose and the field has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The arms use the old &quot;English&quot;-style of shield with a mural crown sits on top signifying that the municipality contains a city. The design shows the importance of the Karljohansvern naval base and the gardens of the city. The arms were designed by Andreas Bloch. The municipal flag is white with the coat of arms in the centre.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has four parishes () within the municipality of Horten. It is part of the Nord-Jarlsberg prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg.

==Geography==
Horten Municipality is located on the western shore of the Ytre Oslofjord in Vestfold County. It borders Tønsberg Municipality to the south and west and Holmestrand Municipality to the north. Other nearby towns include Tønsberg to the south and the much smaller Holmestrand to the north. About half of the municipality&#x27;s total area is made up of forests, while slightly less than a third is agricultural land. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Horten, along the coast. The smaller town of Åsgårdstrand is located in the southern part of the municipality, along the coast. The inland villages of Skoppum, Borre, and Nykirke are all located in the rural areas of the municipality.

===Nature preserves===
Nature preserves include Vealøs, Adalstjern, Frebergsvik, and Falkensten. Additional nature preserves are found by the lake Borrevannet and the islands of Løvøya and Bastøy. There is a preserve in Åsgårdstrand as well. Falkenstendammen is a wildlife preserve, home to various nationally threatened species. Reverompa Plant Reserve was established in 2006 due to presence of the nationally endangered crested cow-wheat. Tordenskjoldeika is a protected 700-year-old oak tree by the harbor. Borre National Park is located along the coast, but this is primarily a historic park.

==Government==
Horten Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

==Economy==

Horten&#x27;s employment sector is made up of industry (21.7% as of 2014), health and social services (18.1%), education (12.1%), and commerce and auto-repair (12.7%). The Royal Norwegian Navy was traditionally an important industry, but the city experienced an economic change when the Navy moved its main base to Bergen during the mid-20th century and Horten Verft went bankrupt in 1987. Currently, one of the most important industries is electrical engineering, represented by companies such as &quot;Kongsberg Maritime&quot;, &quot;Kongsberg Norcontrol&quot;, &quot;Simrad Horten&quot;, &quot;GE Vingmed Ultrasound&quot;, and others.
==Culture==
Åsgårdstrand has been a vacation and bathing destination since 1920. It had already become an artists&#x27; colony by then, attracting painters such as Edvard Munch and Fritz Thaulow. Edvard Munch spent a total of seven summers at his vacation home in Åsgårdstrand, known as &quot;Munchs Lille Hus&quot; (&quot;Munch&#x27;s Little House&quot;). The house is now a museum, located on Munch&#x27;s Street (&quot;Munchsgate 25&quot;).

===Borre mounds===

Borrehaugene (from Borre, the name of a local village and &quot;haugene&quot; from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning mound) was the first national park to be founded in Norway. Borre National Park is situated between the towns of Horten and Åsgårdstrand. The park provides important historical knowledge, and can be seen as evidence that there was a center of power here in the Viking Age. The excavations also uncovered an unusually good selection of craft work, much of which is on display in Oslo at the Viking Ship Museum. This style has become known as &quot;Borre style&quot; and is, today, known for its animal and knot ornaments, which were often used for decorating harnesses. The finds also confirm that there was a Viking ship buried at Borrehaugene.

Borre mound cemetery at Borre National Park contains graves of kings dating back to the Migration Period. The park covers and has the largest collection of kings&#x27; graves in Scandinavia. These burial mounds may represent North Europe&#x27;s most extensive collection of graves of the old Scandinavian Yngling dynasty. From 1989 to 1991, new excavations were undertaken both in and around the national park.

==Transportation==

Being located out on a peninsula, most major transportation arteries go to the west of the town of Horten and secondary roads connect the town to these routes. The Moss–Horten Ferry (also known as the Bastø Ferry) crosses the Oslofjord, connecting to the town of Moss in Østfold county. The ferry departs 1–4 times per hour, and the journey takes about 30 minutes. The ferry transports annually about 1.8 million vehicles and 3.5 million passengers.

The railway line Vestfoldbanen passes through the Horten municipality, but not through the main city center. The main train station in Horten is in the village of Skoppum. Skoppum Station is located southwest of the town centre, although many commuters prefer to use Holmestrand Station due to better road access. Skoppum is 1 hour and 10 minutes by train from Oslo Central Station. By car, Horten is reached by following European route E18 south, and is approximately from Oslo. The nearest airport is Sandefjord Airport Torp which is located about 30 minutes by train south of Skoppum.

==Sports==
Horten has several football clubs. The most successful and well known is FK Ørn-Horten, which currently plays in the Norwegian 2nd Division. Another Horten team, Falk, plays in the Norwegian Third Division, while Borre IF and Holtankammeratene plays further down in the leagues.

== Education ==
The University of South-Eastern Norway has a campus in Horten, commonly referred to as &quot;Bakkenteigen&quot;, which offers a wide range of subjects from sociology, history and language thru mathematics, nature science and maritime studies. Bakkenteigen has over 4,000 students and aims to be a resource for research and development in the region.

<text>is a town in Holmestrand Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The town is the administrative centre of the municipality. It is located along the shore of the Ytre Oslofjord, about northwest of the town of Horten and about south of the village of Sande i Vestfold. The large town of Drammen lies about to the north.

The town has a population (2024) of 8,258 and a population density of .

== History ==

Located around the Oslofjord, Holmestrand developed as a timber/lumber port starting around 1550, when the Dutch came here for timber. In 1663, the place became a customs office under the nearby city of Tønsberg. In 1716, the northern part of Holmestrand was reduced to ashes after a large fire spread through the area. In 1744, King Christian VI designated it a ladested. In 1752, the new King Frederik V granted it kjøpstad (town) status. In the era of sailing ships, the town had a period of prosperity, but when the transition to steamships it was left in a backwater as a shipping town. In the 19th century, the town was known for its medical spas. In 1838, the new formannskapsdistrikt law gave the small town self-governing municipality status. The Vestfoldbanen Railway, which was opened in 1881, led to a lot of new business. In 1884, the entire southern part of the town burned down after another fire. In 1902, after the opening of the Holmestrand–Vittingfoss railway, Holmestrand became the shipping port for wood pulp from Hvittingfoss in what is now Kongsberg Municipality. The track was closed in 1938.

A factory for aluminum processing was built just south of the city in 1917. In 1967, the company became part of Årdal og Sunndal Verk (ÅSV), which was later acquired by Norsk Hydro in 1986. The factory made aluminum products, including under the well-known &quot;Høyang&quot; brand, using aluminum from Høyanger. The Holmestrand Aluminium Museum is now located in the city, celebrating the history of this industry in Holmestrand.

=== Name ===
The municipality (originally the town) is named &quot;Holmestrand&quot; (). The first element is the genitive case of the word which means &quot;rocky islet&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;shore&quot; or &quot;beach&quot;. This is likely referring to three small islets that were located just offshore where the town is now located. The islets are no longer visible due to infilled land reclamation efforts.

== Transportation ==
The European route E18 highway is the main north-south road through Vestfold county. It runs just to the west of the town of Holmestrand and secondary roads connect the city centre to this highway. The Vestfoldbanen railway line runs through the centre of Holmestrand, and the city is served by the Holmestrand Station.

<text>Tønsberg (), historically Tunsberg, is a city in Tønsberg Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located about south-southwest of the capital city of Oslo on the western coast of the Oslofjord near its mouth onto the Skagerrak. The city is the most populous metropolis in Vestfold county. Tønsberg also serves as the administrative centre for Vestfold county and the seat of the County Governor of Vestfold og Telemark.
Tønsberg is generally regarded as the oldest city in Norway, founded in the 9th century. Snorri Sturluson mentions the town in Harald Hårfagre&#x27;s saga (written around 1220) before the battle at Hafrsfjord, which historians have traditionally dated to the year 872, therefore the town was in existence by 871 at the latest. This dating is again based on Are Frode&#x27;s book, Íslendingabók. Using this information, Tønsberg celebrated its one-thousandth anniversary in 1871 and its 1100th anniversary in 1971. Archaeological findings confirm that there was a farm settlement in Tønsberg at the end of the 8th century, which likely developed into a town during the early 9th century.

The city has a population (2023) of 55,387 and a population density of . The city has actually grown to the south onto the island of Nøtterøy, so of the city and 17,979 residents are actually located in Færder Municipality.

The city of Tønsberg was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The rural Sem Municipality was merged with the city of Tønsberg on 1 January 1988, creating a much larger Tønsberg Municipality. The neighboring Re Municipality was merged into Tønsberg on 1 January 2020.

The city is home to Tønsberg Fortress on Slottsfjellet (&quot;Castle Mountain&quot;), which includes ruins from &quot;Castrum Tunsbergis&quot;, Norway&#x27;s largest castle in the 13th century. An outdoor music festival is held at Tønsberg Fortress every July. Tønsberg is also home of Oseberg Mound, where the 9th-century &quot;Oseberg Ship&quot; was excavated.

==General information==
===Name===
The Old Norse name of the town was . The first element is the genitive case of (n) which means &quot;fenced area&quot;, &quot;garden&quot;, or &quot;field around a dwelling&quot;. The last element is (n) which means &quot;mountain&quot; or &quot;rock&quot;. The name originally referred to the fortifications on Slottsfjellet. The old spelling of the name has been retained in the name of the local diocese, Tunsberg bispedømme.
===Coat of arms===
For a long time, the city did not have a formal coat of arms, but instead an old medieval seal dating back to 1349 was used in its place. The blue and white circular seal shows the Tønsberg Fortress surrounded by a ring wall on a mountain with the sea in front. There is also a longship in the water in front of the fortress. Around the seal are the Latin words which means &quot;This is the seal of Tunsberg&quot;. The seal was also used for Tønsberg Municipality until 2020.

==History==
===Viking Age===
Tønsberg is the oldest city in Norway, founded by Harald Fairhair in the 9th century. It was also an ancient capital of Norway. The first time the town was mentioned by a contemporary writer was in 1130. According to Snorri Sturluson, Tønsberg was founded before the Battle of Hafrsfjord, which, according to Snorri, took place in 871. The year of the battle is disputed and most current historians believe it was closer to 900. If it took place in 871, this makes Tønsberg one of the oldest present Scandinavian cities. It was based upon this that the city&#x27;s 1000 years jubilee was celebrated in 1871, and 1100 years jubilee in 1971. The archaeological excavations conducted in 1987–88 underneath the monastery ruins revealed several Viking graves which have served to confirm the earlier age of the original settlement.

The King or his ombudsman resided in the old Royal Court at &quot;Sæheimr&quot;, today the Jarlsberg Manor (), and on the farm &quot;Haugar&quot;, (from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot; meaning hill or burial mound), which can be assumed to have been Tønsberg&#x27;s birthplace. Haugar became the seat for the Haugating, the Thing for Vestfold and Norway&#x27;s second most important place for the proclamation of kings. The site had probably been named after two Viking Age mounds, which tradition links to two sons of King Harald I, Olaf Haraldsson Geirstadalf, who was king in Vestfold, and his half-brother, Sigrød Haraldsson, King of Trondheim. Both are presumed to have fallen in battle at Haugar against their half-brother Eric Bloodaxe and to have been buried on the same spot.

Slottsfjellet (&quot;Castle Mountain&quot;), north of the city centre, made for a near impregnable natural fortress. During the civil war era of the 12th century, it was fortified by the Baglers. The Birkebeiners besieged it for 20 weeks in the winter of 1201 before the Baglers surrendered. In the 13th century, King Haakon Haakonson set up a castle in Tønsberg, Tønsberg Fortress. The town was destroyed by fire in 1536, but Tønsberg remained one of the most important harbour towns in Norway. James VI of Scotland stopped in Tønsberg on his way to meet Anne of Denmark in Oslo, and David Lindsay gave a sermon on 16 November 1589. The event was recorded by a painted inscription in the church, which survives in the museum.

===Whaling epoch===
The center of the world&#x27;s modern whaling industry was concentrated in the cities of Tønsberg and neighboring Sandefjord and Larvik, all of which were the dominant whaling towns in Norway. While whalers from Sandefjord established the first whaling station in the Faroe Islands, whalers from Tønsberg initiated whaling in Iceland and the Hebrides.

During the 1850s, Tønsberg turned into a base of operation and source of expertise for whalers in the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Tønsberg has been called &quot;the cradle of modern whaling&quot;. In the 1892 publication &quot;Handbook for Travellers in Norway&quot; by John Murray, Tønsberg was described as &quot;the centre of the Norwegian whaling and sealing industries in the Arctic Ocean.&quot;

The first whaling ventures to Antarctica was led by engineer Henrik Henriksen of Tønsberg. Henrik Johan Bull was another noted whaler from the city, known for his expeditions to Antarctica. Bull traveled from Australia to Tønsberg in order to learn from local whaler Svend Foyn, who is recognized as the pioneer of the modern whaling industry.

One of the city&#x27;s most prominent residents, Svend Foyn, was a pioneer who embarked on an 1847 expedition to the Arctic, which led to a catch of 6,000 seals. Soon Tønsberg Harbor was home to a large fleet of sealing vessels, and the sealing industry grew further after the 1849 repeal of Britain&#x27;s Navigation Acts. The hunters turned the seals to near extinction in the Arctic Ocean, and therefore turned to Bottle-nosed whales during the 1870s. Norway maintained a monopoly on European whaling until 1883, first and foremost due to Svend Foyn&#x27;s patent rights to whaling techniques and inventions. Over-hunting in the Arctic eventually drove the whalers to Antarctica. By the beginning of the 20th century, Tønsberg had lost its preeminence in the whaling industry to the neighboring city of Sandefjord. Sandefjord, which lies just southwest of Tønsberg, later became known as the world&#x27;s whaling capital.

===World War II===
During the German occupation of Norway in World War II, the Berg concentration camp was constructed near Tønsberg. In 1948, Tønsberg became the cathedral city of the Diocese of Tunsberg (), based at the Tønsberg Cathedral. The diocese was created when the counties of Buskerud and Vestfold were separated from the Diocese of Oslo.

===Oseberg Mound===

Tønsberg is the site of Oseberg Mound, a Viking era burial mound. The Oseberg Ship was found in the Oseberg burial mound in 1904. This Viking era longship is now in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo. Archaeological excavations in 1904 uncovered history&#x27;s largest and richest example of craftsmanship from the Viking Age. In addition to the Oseberg Ship, Oseberghaugen contained the Oseberg carriage, five intricately carved bed-posts shaped like animal heads, four sledges, beds, chests, weaving-frames, household utensils and much more. Scientific examinations in 1992 now date the burial to 834 AD, and indicate a probability that it was Queen Alvhild, the first wife of King Gudrød, who was buried here.

When unearthed, the ship was buried in blue clay and covered with stones beneath the high Oseberg Mound.

==Economy==

Tønsberg is mostly a shopping town and an administrative centre. It is also noted especially for its silverware.

==Transport==
The city is served by the railway line Vestfoldbanen, which runs in a loop through the city before reaching Tønsberg Station.

==In popular culture==
Tønsberg has been featured as a location in several films, most notably those set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It is first mentioned in the 2010 film &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; as a location under surveillance by S.H.I.E.L.D. In the 2011 film &quot;Thor&quot;, it is established that centuries ago, Tønsberg was the invasion point of the Frost Giants of Jotunheim, who sought to conquer Earth before they were defeated by Odin and the forces of Asgard. It is then seen in &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;, where the Red Skull acquires the Tesseract from a church. In the 2017 film &quot;&quot;, Odin chooses the town as the site of his death. In &quot;&quot;, the town is renamed &quot;New Asgard&quot; and serves as a refuge for the Asgardians who survived Thanos&#x27;s attack during the events of &quot;&quot;, with Valkyrie as its leader. In &quot;&quot;, New Asgard has become a tourist attraction but suffers political turmoil as a result of the discrimination of Earth&#x27;s governments against otherworldly beings. The Tønsberg raid by Hydra is also recreated in the first episode of &quot;What If...?&quot;, albeit it occurs much later than in &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;.

Tønsberg is also featured in the 2010 game &quot;Mount and Blade: Warband&quot;″s Viking Conquest expansion as the capital of the Kingdom of Northvegr.

<text>Sandefjord () is a municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Vestfold. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sandefjord. Other population centres in Sandefjord include Andebu, Fevang, Fokserød, Fossnes, Freberg, Hafallen, Helgerød, Himberg, Høyjord, Kodal, Lahelle, Melsomvik, Råstad, Solløkka, Stokke, Storevar, Strand, and Unneberg.

The municipality is the 233rd largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Sandefjord is the most populous municipality in Vestfold and the 14th most populous municipality in Norway, with a population of 65,574. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 6.5% over the previous 10-year period.

Sandefjord is known for its rich Viking history and the prosperous whaling industry, which made Sandefjord the richest city in Norway. Today, it has built up the third-largest merchant fleet in Norway. Sandefjord Museum is the only museum in Europe dedicated to whaling, and is home to Gokstad Mound where the 9th-century Gokstad Ship was discovered.

Sandefjord has numerous nicknames, including the whaling &quot;capital&quot; of Norway or as the undisputed summer city of Norway. Sandefjord is also known as the &quot;whaling capital of the world.&quot; It has also been dubbed the &quot;Bathing City&quot; (Badebyen), due to its many beaches and former resort spas. It is still considered a resort town, due to high numbers of visitors during summer months.

Sandefjord has become a transportation hub, home of Torp Airport, one of Norway&#x27;s largest airports. Daily ferry connections to Sweden are provided by Color Line from the city harbor. European Route E18, one of Norway&#x27;s main north–south highways, traverses the municipality.

Sandefjord is a stronghold for the Conservative Party; the Conservative coalition received over 70 percent of votes cast in 2011. Current mayor is Bjørn Ole Gleditsch from the Conservative Party, who has been mayor since 2004.

== General information ==

The ladested of Sandefjord was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1845, the ladested of Sandefjord was made a kjøpstad (giving it market town rights). On 1 January 1889, a part of the neighboring municipality of Sandeherred (population: 318) was transferred into Sandefjord. In 1931, an area of the neighboring municipality of Sandar (population: 66) was transferred into Sandefjord. In 1950, another area of the neighboring municipality of Sandar (population: 226) was transferred into Sandefjord.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1968 the municipality of Sandefjord (population: 6,242) was merged with the surrounding municipality of Sandar (population: 24,898), creating a much larger municipality of Sandefjord.

On 1 January 2017, the rural municipalities of Andebu and Stokke were merged into Sandefjord as part of a nationwide municipal reform. This merger was the first one to take place during the reform.

=== Etymology ===
The name Sandefjord was first mentioned in chapter 169 of &quot;Sverris saga&quot; from the year 1200. It was then referring to the fjord which is now known as &quot;Sandefjordsfjord&quot;. The municipality (originally the city of Sandefjord) is named after the local fjord, now called Sandefjordsfjorden since the city of Sandefjord grew up at the head of the fjord. The first element of the name comes from the old &quot;Sande&quot; farm (). The old farm name is the plural form of which means &quot;sand&quot; or &quot;sandbanks&quot;. The last element comes from the word which means &quot;fjord&quot;.

=== Coat of arms ===
Sandefjord has had two coats of arms over the course of its history.

The original coat of arms was granted on 9 May 1914 and they were in use until 1 January 2017. The official blazon is &quot;Or, a Viking ship sable with a sail paly gules and argent under a whale embowed&quot;. This means the arms have a field (background) has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The arms usually showed a mural crown over the shield. The charge is a Viking ship with a red and white striped sail with an arched whale over the top. The Viking ship symbolizes the famous Gokstad ship, which was found in Sandefjord in 1880, one of the best preserved Viking ships known. The whale symbolizes that in the late 19th and early 20th century, Sandefjord was a main home port for whalers operating in the southern oceans. The arms were designed by Andreas Bloch. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

The current coat of arms was approved for use starting on 1 January 2017, after the merger of Andebu, Stokke, and Sandefjord. The official blazon is &quot;Or, a whaler with raised harpoon on a boat issuant from the base sable&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The charge is a whaler with a harpoon standing on a boat that is coming out of the base of the shield. The arms show part of a local whale hunting monument to symbolize the historical importance of whaling. The arms were designed by Erik Raastad from Sandefjord who called the design &quot;courage and strength&quot;. There were also minor modification done by the heraldic expert Jan Eide from Oslo. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

== History ==
=== Viking history ===
Sandefjord has been inhabited for thousands of years. Excavations indicate that people have inhabited Sandefjord for around 3,000 years. Rock carvings at Haugen farm by Istrehågan in Jåberg are dated to 1,500–500 BCE. Haugen farm is home to Vestfold county&#x27;s largest petroglyph site. In 1961–1962, 78 rock carvings were discovered at the site. They consist of ships, spiral figures, circular hollows, and much more.

The Vikings lived in Sandefjord and surrounding areas about 1,000 years ago, and numerous Viking artifacts and monuments can be found in Sandefjord. One of the most important remains from the Viking Age was found at the grave site &quot;Gokstadhaugen&quot; (Gokstad Mound) in Sandefjord. The Gokstad ship was excavated by Nicolay Nicolaysen and is now in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo. The &quot;Viking&quot;, an exact replica of the Gokstad ship, crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Bergen to be exhibited at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. A replica of the Gokstad ship, called &quot;Gaia&quot;, currently has Sandefjord as home port. Other known replicas include the &quot;Munin&quot;, (a half scale replica) located in Vancouver, Canada.

The Gokstad Ship, Norway&#x27;s largest preserved Viking ship, was discovered during an excavation at Gokstad Mound in 1880. The Vikings first settled here due to its speedy route from Sandefjord and along the coast. Viking settlements and grave sites have been discovered in Sandefjord.

Sandefjord functioned as a seaport defined by the twin industries of shipping and shipbuilding throughout the 1600s and 1700s. It was formally recognized as a market town (kjøpstad) by King Oscar in 1845. Its population at the time was 749 residents.

=== Health resort ===

The city of Sandefjord became known as a world-renowned health resort destination between 1837 and 1939. Royalty and Prime Ministers from throughout Europe visited the town for its spas in the late 1800s. It gained its reputation as a health and pleasure community when Sandefjord sulfur spa and resort () was established in 1837. It was the first spa in town and functioned as a medical institution focusing on the treatment of symptoms for rheumatic diseases. The original bathhouse has been restored and is now a culture house by the city center. It was one of Europe&#x27;s most visited baths until its closure in 1939.

Around 50,000 people, mostly Norwegians, visited the bath from 1837 to 1939. A majority of spa visitors were from Norway, but international guests from Germany, Britain, and the United States also visited the spas of Sandefjord. Today the bath&#x27;s building, &quot;Kurbadet&quot;, has been restored and hosts cultural events and various annual activities.

=== Town fires ===
Sandefjord has experienced numerous town fires, including a town fire in 1800 which led to most of the town burning down and subsequently having to be rebuilt. An additional fire in 1900 destroyed 56 houses and caused major damage. Sandefjord&#x27;s ships and the shipping industry remained untouched from the major fire of March 1900. The fire, which started on the night before 16 March 1900, led to the entire city center burning down, including important business offices. Both newspapers in town, &quot;Sandefjords Blad&quot; and &quot;Vestfold&quot;, saw their offices burnt down. Six jewelry stores, three watchmakers, eight grocery stores, and a variety of other shops were destroyed. The fire started in the factory &quot;Nordmannen&quot;. The fire caused the loss of 51 buildings for a total value of in addition to in loss of store items. Sandefjord Church (built in 1872) also burnt down during the town fire of 1900.

A new town fire on 27–28 March 1915 led to the death of two people and destroyed seven farms. Large parts of the street Storgata were also destroyed.

=== Whaling and ships ===

Sandefjord is perhaps best known as a whaling community. The centre of the world&#x27;s modern whaling industry was located in town, and local residents not only made up practically all the crew on the Norwegian whaling fleet, but substantial numbers of them also worked within the whaling industry in nearby countries. For over fifty years in the late 1800s, Sandefjord functioned as the world center for the whaling industry, including the manufacture and equipment of whaling vessels, floating factories, and whale-catchers. Sandefjord has also been named the &quot;whaling capital of the world.&quot; There were 25 whaling companies that were established in Sandefjord between 1905 and 1914. During the 1911–1912 season, Sandefjord had 27 whaling companies with a total of 115 vessels. This made up over 30 percent of the world&#x27;s whaling firms.

Starting in 1850, a number of ships from Sandefjord were whaling and sealing in the Arctic Ocean and along the coast of Finnmark. The first whaling expedition from Sandefjord to the Antarctic Ocean was sent in 1905. Towards the end of the 1920s, Sandefjord had a fleet of 15 factory ships and more than 90 whalers. In 1954, more than 2,800 men from the district were hired as crew on the whalers, but from the mid-1950s whaling was gradually reduced. The number of southbound expeditions rapidly decreased during the 1960s, and the 1967–1968 season became the last for Sandefjord. In 1971, Sandefjord&#x27;s last whale processing vessel was sold to Japan. The shipping industry was gradually readjusted from whaling to other ship types during this period. The local Framnæs Mekaniske Værksted and Jotun Group Private Ltd. had major roles in this business.

Today, the memories of this important period of Sandefjord&#x27;s history are kept alive at the Whaling Museum (). This museum is the only museum in Europe specializing in whales and the history of whaling. The history of the whalers can also be explored at the Museum&#x27;s Wharf with a visit aboard the whale-catcher &quot;Southern Actor&quot;. Whaling is considered to be the industry which made Sandefjord the richest city in Norway.

Sandefjord also has shipping traditions of tall sailing ships and steam ships. The full-rigged sailing ship &quot;Christian Radich&quot;, three-masted barquentine &quot;Endurance&quot;, whale catcher &quot;Jason&quot; and Viking ship replica &quot;Viking&quot; were some of the many ships built by Framnæs Mekaniske Værksted.

Hans Albert Grøn of Sandefjord established the first whaling station in the Faroe Islands in 1894, which was located at Gjánoyri on the island of Streymoy. As of 1903, half of all whaling companies in the Faroe Islands were operated out of Sandefjord. Furthermore, Sandefjord was the headquarters of the South African Whaling Company (SAWC), which was established in 1908 and managed by shipowner Johan Bryde of Sandefjord. Sandefjordian whaling firms were also established on the coast of Africa, in Portugal, Mexico, Western Australia, among other places.

=== Antarctic expeditions ===
Towards the beginning of World War I, Norwegian whaling spread throughout the world, most and foremost from Sandefjord. Expeditions from Sandefjord went as far as Norwegian Bay in Australia, Stewart Island in New Zealand, Walvis Bay in Namibia, Corral, Chile, and also isolated places such as Kerguelen Islands, South Georgia Island, Bouvet Island, and the Southern Ocean.

In the 1910s, affluent resident August F. Christensen was given a grant to practice whaling outside Peru and Ecuador. He was also appointed Ecuador&#x27;s consul to Norway. He achieved an agreement with Ecuadorian government officials which allowed Norwegians to inhabit the Galápagos Islands, and also receive of land, pay no taxes for ten years, and be allowed to keep their Norwegian citizenship. Christensen created huge local interest of Galápagos, and the local company &quot;La Colonia de Floreana A/S&quot; was established on 21 March 1925. Its main goal was to exploit the Norwegian fishing rights at the Galápagos Islands. A ship named &quot;Floreana&quot; departed from Sandefjord on 15 May 1925, equipped with enough men and goods to establish a colony.
On 16 November 1904, Carl Anton Larsen of Sandefjord established the whaling community of Grytviken, the largest settlement in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. South Georgia Island lies a few thousand kilometers east of Cape Horn.

Nils Larsen (1900–1976) was a sea captain from Sandefjord, famous for his expeditions of Antarctica in the early 20th century. It was under his expeditions that Norway achieved annexation of Bouvet Island in 1927 and Peter I Island two years after. A cove on Antarctica&#x27;s Peter I Island is named Sandefjord Cove in honor of Larsen&#x27;s hometown. Sandefjord Ice Bay in continental Antarctica is also named after Sandefjord. Mount Nils Larsen in Queen Maud Land, Mount Nils in Enderby Land and Nils Larsen Glacier are examples of many geographical names given in honor of Nils Larsen.

=== World War II ===

A week after Operation Weserübung, German forces entered Sandefjord on 16 April 1940. About 30-40 men arrived in semi-trucks from Horten under the leadership of Erik von Drydalski. After handing their directives to Sandefjord police chief Kjartan Bruun Hansen, the men left for Hotel Atlantic, where they established their headquarters in Sandefjord. German troops in Sandefjord soon rose to 200. At the beginning of the German occupation of Norway, a German &quot;Hafenkapitän&quot; (harbormaster) was placed at Tollboden, and a representative for Admiral Norwegen was placed in an office building at Framnes verft. German soldiers could be seen marching throughout the city. At the beginning of the occupation, over 2,000 German officers visited &quot;Socitetsbygningen&quot; (today&#x27;s Park Hotel), which belonged to Sandefjord Spa. The Nazi flag was waving over the building during the visit. Norwegian students were told to learn the German language, and handed out a book, &quot;Deutsche Fibel&quot;. They were also given a copy of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; translated into the Norwegian language.
German forces constructed two coastal forts in Sandefjord, located at the southern tips of two local peninsulas: Vesterøya and Østerøya. The largest German construction in Sandefjord took place at Folehavna, where a fortress was erected in the spring of 1941. Four cannons with a target range of were installed at the site, along with a tunnel. The four cannons were installed in concrete gun pits on the sloping rocks. German construction also took place by the lake Goksjø, and also at Jernbaneallén, where a former garage structure was turned into a prison camp.

Many local residents were killed during World War II, including a number of seamen. Håkon Andersen of Framnes was killed onboard &quot;Arcturus&quot; when the ship was attacked by British Beaufighters. Albert K. J. Skålsvik (1921–1944) of Krokemoa, a member of the Norwegian Homefleet (&quot;Hjemmeflåten&quot;), was 18 years when the war broke out. Skålsvik was killed, along with the captain, when the ship &quot;DS Kong Bjørn&quot; was attacked by allied warplanes by Ryvingen Lighthouse in 1944. He is now commemorated at the Hall of Remembrance in the town of Stavern in neighborin Larvik Municipality. Skålsvik&#x27;s younger brother, Bernard, was also a part of the Homefleet and was killed at age 17 in 1945.

Radios were illegal, and people of Sandefjord such as Henry Melby of Gokstad was arrested for having a radio in 1942. He was incarcerated at the tanker &quot;Inger Johanne&quot;, which was attacked by allied warplanes in 1944, killing 15 people, including Henry Melby.

In the fall of 1941, German occupation forces replaced Sandefjord&#x27;s city manager Finn Sandberg with NS-member Frithjof Holtedahl who was soon appointed mayor. The neighboring Sandar Municipality received its NS mayor in November 1941, Ole Kristian Holtan. Olaf Bøe from Nasjonal Samling was appointed editor for Sandefjords Presse by Anders Beggerud in 1944.

Following World War II, Norway became one of the founding members of NATO and several air bases were constructed in Norway using NATO funds. One of these was Sandefjord Airport Torp, which was to be used by the United States Air Force in case of war. Construction began in 1953 and was completed in July 1956.

=== SAS merge ===

The municipalities of Sandefjord (S), Andebu (A) and Stokke (S) merged on 1 January 2017. The merge was the first of numerous nationwide merges following a municipal reform by the Solberg Cabinet. The &quot;new&quot; municipality became the most populous in Vestfold county. Proposed names for the &quot;new&quot; municipality were Gokstad, Sandar, and Torp, however, the name &quot;Sandefjord&quot; was ultimately kept.

A poll conducted by the &quot;Sandefjords Blad&quot; newspaper in January 2015 called 600 residents in Andebu, 750 in Stokke, and 1,000 in Sandefjord. All were given the question &quot;Do you think Stokke, Andebu, and Sandefjord should establish one single municipality?&quot;. About 69% of Sandefjord residents answered &quot;yes&quot;, while 64% (Andebu) and 61% (Stokke) answered &quot;yes&quot; in Stokke and Andebu.

Few Stokke residents read &quot;Sandefjords Blad&quot;, the main newspaper of Sandefjord, and relatively few residents commute to the city of Sandefjord for work. Despite this, Stokke residents voted to merge with Sandefjord due to two key features: its wealth and the nearby international airport. About 78 percent of Stokke residents ultimately voted to merge into Sandefjord during the September 2015 elections.

=== Population growth ===
The municipality experienced a 98.6 percent population growth from 1875 to 1900. Even not including the boundary adjustments between the municipalities of Sandar and Sandefjord in 1888, this population increase was substantially higher than most Norwegian cities. Sandar experienced the largest population growth of any Norwegian town, and over twice the growth of other towns in Vestfold County.

From 1875 to 1900, the disposable income of people from Sandefjord increased by over 200 percent. Total assets in local banks also increased, and in 1895–1900, total assets went from NOK 0.6 to 1.9 million in Aktiekreditbanken and from NOK 1.1 million to 1.3 million in Sandefjords Sparebank. Even after whaling lost its importance, Sandefjord remained Norway&#x27;s richest city, and from 1913 to 1917, the median income increased by over 350 percent.

== Geography ==
Sandefjord is a coastal municipality on the western shore of the Oslo Fjord. It can be described as a suburb of Oslo, situated southwest of the capital. Sandefjord is the largest municipality in Vestfold county. Its coastline has various beaches and sheltered coves, and several forests are scattered across the municipality. The two peninsulas called Østerøya (&quot;East Island&quot;) and Vesterøya (&quot;West Island&quot;) contribute to a total coastline of , and form the Sandefjordsfjorden and Mefjorden. The coastline offers a wide variety of sandy beaches, skerries, and islets, along with bays and sloping rocks. Forested areas are often laced with paths and lighted for trails for summer hikes and winter skiing. Of Sandefjord&#x27;s total area, (31%) is agricultural and (26%) is forest. About 2 percent is made up of lakes and rivers. Sandefjord is located east of Larvik Municipality, west of Færder Municipality, and southwest of Tønsberg Municipality.

The coastal municipality includes about 124 islands. Small island bays give shelter for overnight campers, and many islets have relatively accessible beaches. Sandefjord is home to several peninsulas, including the Vesterøya, the Østerøya, the Engø, Marøy, and Årø. The island of Langøya (Langø) is the largest island at , while other islands include the Ravnø, the Skogøy/Storøya, the Natholmen, the Storholmen, the Ormestadholmen, the Grindholmen, and the Granholmen. Despite its location in between Flautangen and Lindholmen (both part of Færder Municipality) in the Tønsbergfjorden, the archipelago of Stauper belongs to Sandefjord. It consists of ten large islands and a number of smaller skerries and islets.

There were two natural lakes in Sandefjord prior to the 2017 merger: Goksjø, which is the third-largest in Vestfold County, and the smaller lake Napperødtjern. Napperødtjern lies a few hundred meters north of Goksjø and is a nature preserve surrounded by swamp forests and wetland. Artificial ponds include Bugårdsdammen, Brydedammen, Virikdammen, Kroksjø, Veradammen, Svarttjern, and others. Local wildlife such as moose, deer, and avifauna can often be observed near freshwater lakes and rivers.

Sandefjord has four fjords: Sandefjordsfjord, Lahellefjord, Mefjord, and Tønsbergfjord, which it shares with neighboring Tønsberg and Færder municipalities.

The highest point in the municipality is Brånafjell at , which lies northwest of the village of Høyjord. Hjertås at above sea level is the highest point within the city of Sandefjord. From the peak are surrounding views of the Oslofjord, Vealøs by Skien, Skrim and Torp.

=== Climate ===

The climate of the entirety of Norway is extremely affected by the Gulf Stream. Were it not for the warming effects of the Gulf Stream, coastal cities along the Oslo Fjord would be up to colder. This means that the climate, the summers especially, are warmer than in other regions at the same latitude, i.e. the State of Alaska or Siberia. Sandefjord has a higher latitude than Juneau, Alaska; Sandefjord is at 59°08′N, while the capital of Alaska is at 58°18′N. Sandefjord experiences more sun than any other Norwegian municipality during the summer months.

Warm breezes from the Skagerrak cause a mild climate, and Sandefjord experiences the highest annual number of cloud-free days in Norway. The climate is relatively mild for its latitude. Fields become green in early May, but the air remains slightly cold. The summer seldom begins before the end of May, when temperatures often rapidly increase. The whole month of June and most of July experience little darkness during night and songbirds are silent for only 2–3 hours at most. July is the warmest month of the year in Sandefjord when temperatures often rise above .

Sandefjord has a relatively humid continental climate (Dfb) with warm summers, no dry season, and relatively much precipitation year long. During the colder season, which is from the end of November until early March, there is a 56 percent average chance that precipitation will be observed during a given day. The likelihood of snow falling is highest in late January and the season in which it is likely to snowfall spans from early November until early April. The coldest day of the year in Sandefjord is 4 February, with an average low temperature of and average high of only .

A small part of Sandefjord, the Himberg farm, is an exclave inside the borders of the neighboring Larvik Municipality. All efforts at annexing Himberg into surrounding Larvik have been met with massive protests from local residents. A 1995 annexation attempt was ultimately canceled due to large protests from Himberg residents. Himberg is a rural agricultural community consisting of no more than ten households.

<text>Larvik () is a municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Vestfold. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Larvik. Other main population centres in the municipality include the town of Stavern and the villages of Gjone, Helgeroa, Hem, Kjose, Kvelde, Nevlunghavn, Skinmo, Svarstad, Ula, Verningen, and Tjøllingvollen.

The municipality is the 140th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Larvik is the 21st most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 48,246. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 5.9% over the previous 10-year period.

The city of Larvik achieved market town status in 1671, but it did not become a self-governing municipality until 1 January 1838 when the formannskapsdistrikt law went into effect.

Larvik is known as the hometown of Thor Heyerdahl. It is also home to &quot;Bøkeskogen&quot;, the northernmost beech tree forest in the world. Larvik is the home of Norway&#x27;s only natural mineral water spring, Farriskilden. &quot;Farris Bad&quot;, located in Larvik, has been described as one of the best spas in Europe. It has the largest spa department in Scandinavia.

==General information==
The town of Larvik was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1875, a small area of Brunlanes Municipality (population: 4) and a different area of Hedrum Municipality (population: 46) were both transferred into the town of Larvik. In 1937, another area of Hedrum Municipality (population: 69) was transferred into Larvik. In 1948, an area of Hedrum Municipality (population: 296) was transferred into Larvik. On 1 January 1974, the unpopulated Tagtvedt area of Hedrum was transferred to Larvik. On 1 January 1986, part of the Åsveien 3 property in Hedrum was transferred to the neighboring town of Larvik.

On 1 January 1988, the city of Larvik was part of a major municipal merger which consolidated the municipalities of Brunlanes (population: 8,138), Hedrum (population: 10,449), and Tjølling (population: 7,878) with the towns of Larvik (population: 8,045) and Stavern (population: 2,538) to create a new, much larger Larvik Municipality with a population of 37,048 people.

On 1 January 2018, Lardal Municipality was merged the neighboring Larvik Municipality as part of a nationwide municipal reform. After merging, Larvik was the largest municipality in Vestfold by area and the second-most populous municipality in Vestfold.

===Etymology===
The municipality (originally the town of Larvik) is named after the small cove at the end of the Larviksfjorden, which was historically called in Old Norse. The first element is the genitive case of &#x27;water, river&#x27; (here referring to the Numedalslågen River). The last element is &#x27;cove, inlet&#x27;. Thus, the meaning of the name is &#x27;cove at the mouth of a river&#x27;. Prior to 1889, the name was written &quot;Laurvik&quot; or &quot;Laurvig&quot;. 

===Coat of arms===

Larvik has had three different coats of arms since 1889.

The first coat of arms was granted in 1889 and it was in use until 20 January 1989 when a new coat of arms was granted. The official blazon was &quot;Argent, a leaved tree issuant from a mount vert&quot;. This means the arms have a field (background) has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The charge is a green tree growing out of a green hill. The green color in the field and the tree design symbolize the local beech forest around the town. This design may have been chosen because for a couple of reasons. A beech tree had been used by the 18th century governor of the area, Jens Kielman. Also this beech tree design was part of a seal of a local guild in the early 19th century.

The second coat of arms was granted on 17 March 1989 and it was in use until 1 January 2018. The official blazon was &quot;Azure, a mast with three sails argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a ship&#x27;s mast with three sails. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue color in the field and the design were chosen to represent the maritime traditions of the municipality. The arms were designed by Kjell Ronald Hansen. The municipal flag had the same design as the coat of arms.

The current coat of arms was adopted for use starting on 1 January 2018. The blazon is &quot;Azure, a tree with seven droplet-shaped leaves, of which six are opposite two and two, issuant from a mount argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a tree design with six leaves shaped like water droplets that are arranged symmetrically, three on each side and one on top. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The arms have a complex symbolism. The seven drops symbolize forest water that flows into streams and further into the main Numedalslågen and Farriselva rivers. The tree design symbolizes the importance of the local beech forests and forestry industry. The six water drops also symbolized the ports spread along the coast as well as the six former municipalities that are now together as one large municipality. The arms were designed by Tormod Henriksen from Svarstad. The municipal flag had the same design as the coat of arms.

==History==
Various remains from the Stone Age have been discovered throughout the municipality of Larvik, for instance by Torpevannet near the village of Helgeroa. Raet goes through all of Vestfold County before peaking out of the ocean in Mølen in Larvik. Ancient peoples have carried rocks from Raet and constructed vast numbers of burial mounds at Mølen. During the Roman Iron Age, ancient peoples erected a stone monument resembling a ship at Istrehågan, one of Norway&#x27;s greatest remains () from prehistoric times.

About southeast of the town is Skiringssal, an archaeological site where archaeologists first discovered burial mounds and an ancient Viking hall, and later uncovered the nearby remains of an ancient town, Kaupang. This is now known as the oldest known merchant town in Norway. There was international trade from this area, over 1,200 years ago. Skiringssal has remains from the oldest town yet discovered in the Nordic countries, and it was one of Scandinavia&#x27;s earliest urban sites.

Larvik (which historically used the Danish spelling: &quot;Laurvig&quot;) was an old coastal village. In 1671, the village received kjøpstad (market town) status in 1671 when Ulrik Fredrik Gyldenløve bought the Fritsø estate. He later became the first Count of Laurvig. The count built a new residence in 1674, &quot;Herregården&quot;, which can still be visited today. The whole Larvik area was owned by a Danish Count () until 1817. Since the rest of Norway had come under Swedish rule in 1814, the county was purchased by four local businessmen in 1817. Then in 1821, it became part of the newly created Jarslberg og Laurvigs amt (county).
Larvik is also the site of the Treschow estate, &quot;Fritzøehus&quot;, which is currently owned by the heirs of Mille-Marie Treschow, reportedly &quot;Norway&#x27;s richest woman&quot;. The Treschow estate was created in 1835 when Willum Frederik Treschow bought the county from the Danish crown, who in turn had bought the county from the local consortium &quot;grevlingene&quot;, four local entrepreneurs who proved unable to manage the ownership financially (the consortium had bought the county from the Danish crown in 1817 originally, the crown taking over the county when the last of the counts had to sell it because of debt).

Larvik, along with neighbouring cities of Sandefjord and Tønsberg, were the three dominant whaling cities of Norway in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Government==
Larvik Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Vestfold District Court and the Agder Court of Appeal.

<doc id="178272" wikidata="Q12004287" url="?curid=178272" title="Svelvik">
<text>is a town in Drammen Municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. The town is located along the west shore of the Drammensfjorden, about to the southeast of the town of Drammen and about north of the village of Berger. The village of Klokkarstua (in Asker Municipality) lies about to the east, across the fjord.

The town has a population (2023) of 4,256 and a population density of . The town lies mostly in Drammen Municipality, but a small part of the urban area of Svelvik lies on the other side of the fjord (which is only wide at that point). About 130 people live right across the fjord in Asker Municipality.

The newspaper &quot;Svelviksposten&quot; has been published in Svelvik since 1983.

==History==
The town of Svelvik was established as a ladested on 1 January 1845 when it was separated from Strømm Municipality. Initially, the new town had a population of 1,201. The town was historically located in Jarlsberg og Laurvig county (present-day Vestfold county). Under the formannskapsdistrikt law, Svelvik was granted self-governing status as a municipality since it was a town. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Svelvik (population: 1,188) was merged with Strømm Municipality (population: 2,618) to form the new Svelvik Municipality. On 1 January 2020, Svelvik Municipality (population: 6,685) was merged into the neighboring Drammen Municipality (which made it switch from Vestfold to Viken county), so from then on, the town of Svelvik has been part of Drammen Municipality. On 1 January 2024, Viken county was dissolved and this area became part of Buskerud county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Svelvik&quot; farm () since the first Svelvik Church was built there. The first element comes from the word which means &quot;sword&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;bay&quot; or &quot;cove&quot;. The name &quot;sword bay&quot; is likely referring to the &quot;Ryggen&quot; promontory ridge across from the town of Svelvik. The ridge juts out into the Drammensfjorden like a sword and divides the fjord into two halves. The neighboring farm is called &quot;Sverstad&quot; () which has the same etymology.

==Geography==

The town is located on the western shore of the Drammensfjorden. The narrow Svelvikstrømmen strait is located part-way along the fjord, near the town of Svelvik. The shortest ferry line in Norway crosses the fjord there, connecting Svelvik to the Hurum peninsula.

The little town has small, winding streets and traditional, white-painted houses. Svelvik has many venues for swimming and sunbathing.

<text>Sande or Sande i Vestfold is a village in Holmestrand Municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The village is located along the &quot;Sandebukta&quot; bay off the Ytre Oslofjord about south of Oslo (about 50 minutes driving time). There are several nearby villages around Sande including the villages of Klever and Eikeberg about to the north, the village of Selvik about to the southeast, the town of Holmestrand about to the south, and the village of Hof about to the west. The European route E18 highway and the Vestfoldbanen railway line both past through the village of Sande.

The village has a population (2023) of 2,342 and a population density of . In recent years the village of Sande has grown significantly due to many new apartments and stores.
The newspaper &quot;Sande Avis&quot; is published in Sande. Portions of the 1973 &quot;Olsenbanden&quot; movie &quot;Olsenbanden tar gull&quot; from were filmed in Sande. Another portion was filmed in Stavern.

==History==
Finds from the Stone Age indicate that the settlement in the area is up to 6,000–7,000 years old. The village was formerly called &quot;Angr&quot; (meaning &quot;fjord&quot;), but was later named after the rectory farm called &quot;Sandvin&quot;. About 400 ancient artefacts and Burial mounds have been found in several places around Sande. The rock carvings on Sjøl are the only known carving field from the Bronze Age between Bærum and Sandefjord.

The village was the administrative centre of the old Sande Municipality which existed from 1838 until 2020 when the municipality became part of Holmestrand Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Sande&quot; farm () since the first Sande Church was built there. The first element comes from the word which means &quot;sand&quot;. The last element comes from the word which means &quot;meadow&quot; or &quot;pasture&quot;.

==Sande Church==

The medieval era Sande Church is located in the village of Sande. The parish is part of the Nord-Jarlsberg prosti. The building material is stone and brick, and it was built in 1150. In 1783, the church burned down; only the walls remained. Over the next eight years, it was rebuilt, and 1860 the church was refurnished. But the older altarpiece, baptismal font, and pulpit were retained. The pulpit is also from 1783 and features Rococo-style carvings. The font of soapstone is the only medieval inventory preserved.

<text>Andebu is a former municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution on 1 January 2017. The area is now part of Sandefjord Municipality. The administrative centre was the village of Andebu. Other main villages in Andebu include Høyjord and Kodal.

Andebu was the fourth-largest municipality in Vestfold county and it was situated in the center of the county. Upon its dissolution, the municipality had a population of 5,937. The municipality&#x27;s population density was .

Andebu&#x27;s economy was primarily related to logging and forestry. Andebu has been inhabited for centuries and the oldest artifacts retrieved here dates back 4000 years to the Iron Age. Most retrieved artifacts are various types of tools, mainly axes made of flint and other rocks. Andebu’s geography consists mainly of valleys, hills, mountains, forests, and lakes.

== General information ==
The parish of &quot;Andebo&quot; (later spelled &quot;Andebu&quot;) was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1878, an area of Hedrum municipality (population: 61) was transferred to Andebu. On 1 January 2017, a municipal merger took place: the municipalities of Sandefjord (population: 45,820), Stokke (population: 11,657), and Andebu (population: 5,937) were merged to form a new, larger Sandefjord Municipality. Andebu now makes up the northern part of the new municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Andebu&quot; farm () since the first Andebu Church was built there. The meaning of the first element is unknown, but one possibility is that it comes from the old male name , but this is not certain. The last element comes from the word which means &quot;dwelling&quot; or &quot;farm&quot;. Prior to 1889, the name was spelled &quot;Andebo&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 12 December 1986. The official blazon is &quot;Vert, three triangles argent, one over two&quot; (). This means the arms have a green field (background) and the charge is a set of three equilateral triangles with one over two. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The green color in the field symbolizes the importance of agriculture and forestry. The three triangles were chosen to symbolize the three villages/parishes in the municipality: Andebu, Høyjord, and Kodal. The three triangles also are set up to look like the letter A, the first letter of the municipal name. The arms were designed by Kjell Skoli. The municipal flag had the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway had three parishes () within the municipality of Andebu. It was part of the Sandefjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg.

Andebu Church was the main church for the municipality. It was built around the year 1100. It is a stone church with seating for 300. The soapstone baptismal font is from the 1100s. The altarpiece and the pulpit are in Renaissance style and date from about 1650. The church was extensively restored in 1686. The church is home to Norway&#x27;s oldest existing written parish register from 1623. The ridge turret was destroyed in a storm in 1701 and had to be rebuilt.

The Høyjord Stave Church is also located in Andebu and it is the only stave church in Vestfold County.

== History ==
Various historical artifacts and burial mounds dated to the Viking Age have been discovered in Andebu. Finds include a bronze key, a stone axe, arrows, and more. Burial mounds have been discovered on approximately 30 farms in Andebu, including 17 in the village of Andebu, 5 in Høyjord, and 7 in Kodal. Some mounds are dated back as far as 500 BCE (in other words, over a thousand years prior to the Viking Age). Large amounts of burial mounds are found at Nordre Haugan, Nedre Skjelland, Våle, Vestre Høyjord, Bjørndal, and Gjerstad.

The 14th century Black Plague had a devastating impact on the population of Andebu. It is estimated that the population was 600 as of 1600 A.D., approximately the same amount as prior to the plague, meaning that it took about 200 years to regain the lost population for the area.

Andebu municipality was established on 1 January 1838, with priest Jens H. Otterbeck as its first mayor. Otterbeck served as mayor for 24 years and was the longest-serving mayor of Andebu.

==Government==
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

<text>Stokke is a former municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution on 1 January 2017. The area is now part of Sandefjord Municipality. The administrative centre was the village of Stokke. Other main villages in Stokke included Vear, Melsomvik, Storevar, and Valberg.

Upon its dissolution, the municipality had a population of 11,657. The municipality&#x27;s population density is .

==General information==
The parish of Stokke was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1901, the island of Håøya (population: 70) was transferred from Stokke to the neighboring Nøtterøy municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the island of Veierland (population: 165) was transferred from Stokke to the neighboring Nøtterøy municipality. Then on 1 January 1967, there was a very small boundary adjustment between the municipalities of Sem and Stokke: an area of Sem (population: 2) and an area of Stokke (population: 5) were swapped.

During a nationwide municipal reform by the Solberg Cabinet, 77.8 percent of Stokke residents voted to merge with Sandefjord during the September 2015 elections. On 1 January 2017, a municipal merger took place: the municipalities of Sandefjord (population: 45,820), Stokke (population: 11,657), and Andebu (population: 5,937) were merged to form a new, larger Sandefjord Municipality. Stokke now makes up the central part of the new municipality. On the same date, the village of Vear was transferred from the old Stokke municipality to the neighboring Tønsberg Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Stokke&quot; farm () since the first Stokke Church was built there. The name is the plural form of which means &quot;log&quot; or &quot;stick&quot;. This is probably referring to some hills/ridges near the local church site.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 13 January 1984. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, three s Or&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is a set of three s. The charge has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The arms are canting since means &quot;sticks&quot; or &quot;logs&quot;. The arms show three to represent the three main parishes in the municipality: Stokke, Skjee and Arnadal. The arms were designed by Truls Nygaard, who based it off an original proposal by Hallvard Trætteberg which was further developed by Hans Gerhard Sørensen. The municipal flag had the same design as the coat of arms. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway had three parishes () within the municipality of Stokke. It is part of the Sandefjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg.

==History==

About 16,000 historic artifacts have been found at Brunstad in Stokke, mostly tools made out of flint but also roughly sixty hearths. The first recorded grave from Mesolithic times is also found here and dated to 5900 BCE.

Leading up to 2017, Stokke residents were deciding whether or not to remain as an independent municipality or if they should merge with a neighboring municipality. Relatively few Stokke residents read &quot;Sandefjords Blad&quot;, the main newspaper of Sandefjord, and few residents reside or work in the city of Sandefjord. The wealthiness of Sandefjord, however, was often used as an argument for the merger with Sandefjord. Its international airport &quot;Sandefjord Airport, Torp&quot; was also seen as a deciding factor for Stokke&#x27;s decision to merge into Sandefjord. For the village of Vear, on the other hand, a majority of residents preferred a merge into neighboring Tønsberg. Consequentially, the village was transferred into Tønsberg on 1 January 2017, the day Stokke joined Sandefjord. Vear is home to 2,500 residents as of 2016, which made up 22 percent of Stokke&#x27;s total population prior to the merge.

===Sundås Fort===
Remains of a fort, the Sundås battery, can be found across the Tønsbergfjorden from Håøya Island. The fortifications were constructed in the late 19th century during turbulent times with Sweden during the Union between Sweden and Norway. It was part of the newly established Norwegian Coastal Artillery (). The fort was erected to keep potential enemies from entering Tønsberg by sea, and was also meant to protect the Marine harbor in the village of Melsomvik. Work on the fort began in 1897, and the forts at both Håøya Island and Sundåsen were completed in 1899. Trenches, commando posts, fencing, concrete gun pits, and other remains from the fort can still be seen at Sundås. The fort lies by the Tønsbergfjord with surrounding views of Færder Lighthouse and islands such as Håøya, Tjøme, Veierland, and Nøtterøy. The cannons were demolished by German forces in 1942 during the German occupation of Norway. The Norwegian Armed Forces remained in control of the fort from 1945 until 1962, when it became public property.

==Government==
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

==Geography==

Stokke municipality had a total area of and had a long coastline along the Tønsbergfjord. The village of Stokke is located in-between the cities of Tønsberg and Sandefjord. However, Stokke was primarily a rural community and far smaller than its neighbors. Stokke had a variety of recreation areas, including the Storås area, which includes lakes, rivers, historic sites, and an abundance of plant and wildlife species. Another recreational site is located at Bogen, which also includes a beach and an art gallery. Other coastal communities include the villages of Vear, Melsomvik, and Storevar. Islands included Langø, Ravnø, Gåsø, Gåsøkalven, Verjø, Tryteknatten, and others. Lakes include Akersvannet, Gjennestadvannet, Kulerødvannet, Fossnesdammen, and others. The former municipality was located south of Andebu, north of Sandefjord, west of the Tønsbergfjord, and southwest of Tønsberg and Ramnes.

Both the Vestfoldbanen railway line and the European route E18 highway pass through the former municipality. Its highest point was Høgståsen at . The village of Stokke is home to a nature preserve known as Bokemoa, a birch forest located on Raet. The dense forest creates shade and a habitat for mushrooms; over 100 species of mushrooms have been recorded in Bokemoa, including species only found in birch tree forests.

===Nature preserves===
Nature preserves in Stokke include the island of Langøya, Bokemoa, Melsomvik plant and wildlife preserve as well as the lakes Robergvannet and Akersvannet. The island of Langøya lies in the Tønsbergfjorden and is a car-free island consisting of meadows, knolls, salt meadows, small bays, and forests. It became a landscape conservation area in 2006. It is known for its wide variety of rare wildflowers including species such as sea thrift, alternate-leaved golden-saxifrage, cowslip, greater yellow-rattle, sticky catchfly, and many others.

==Demographics==
The annual population growth in Stokke was twice as high as Vestfold County as a whole, and the expected life expectancy is higher than the county median. About 13 percent of Stokke&#x27;s population were first- or second-generation immigrants as of 2014.

==Transportation==
European route E18 passes through the former municipality. Vestfoldbanen operates the Stokke Station, a railway station in the village of Stokke. Sandefjord Airport Torp is located on the former border with Sandefjord municipality.

==Recreation==

A forest hike can be found at Løke, which is a popular forest for collecting mushrooms. A mountain trail is located by Høgåsen, the highest point in the former municipality with an elevation of . The peak can be reached from two trails: from Langevann in Re or from Grorudvannet in Stokke. The shortest hike is from Grorudvannet.

Trælsodden by the Tønsbergfjorden is home to several burial mounds as well as fortifications dated to World War II. Sandy beaches, diving boards and hiking trails can also be found at Trælsodden. At Trælsodden are graves dated to the Iron Age. At the time, sea levels were higher than today, and the graves were consequentially placed near the shoreline. A popular fishing site is located between Trælsodden and Brunstad. The trail goes by the municipal beach at Brunstad, immediately south of Oslofjord Convention Center. During summers, convenience stores and seafood restaurants are open at Brunstad. From Brunstad, the coastal path heads inwards and passes through the Himalayapark, a park offering tree climbing. The trail passes by a home built by singer Jahn Teigen, known as &quot;Teigen&#x27;s Pyramid&quot;. The trail reaches a beach before entering the boat harbor in Rakkevik. It is a hike from Storevar to Melsomvik, and a similar distance between Melsomvik and Brunstad.

==Wildlife==
Brown bears were common in Stokke until the 1850s, and until the early 1900s, a group of bears lived in the inner parts of Vestfold County. The last Brown bear shot in the county was in Lardal in 1916. The last bear to be shot in Stokke was around 1850 by Andreas Smitten of Russeltvet. A number of local place names derives from its former bears, including Bjønnemyra (Borgen), Bjønnestøkket (Bredholt), Bjønndal (Hauanlia), Bjønneleet (Nedre Anholt), and Bjønnelia (Askerød). Some place names also derive from the Gray wolf, including Ulvekula (Oserød) and Ulvehølet (Rørkollskogen). Other notable mammals in Stokke include the Red fox, European badger, European otter, European pine marten, Short-tailed weasel, European Lynx, Moose, Roe deer, Red deer, European beaver, Mountain hare, Red squirrel, European hedgehog, bats, mice, and rats.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the island of Veierland (population: 165) was transferred from Stokke Municipality to Nøtterøy Municipality. On 1 January 2018, Tjøme Municipality (population: 4,928) and Nøtterøy Municipality (population: 21,748) were merged to form the new Færder Municipality. 

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the island of Nøtterøy () since the first Nøtterøy Church was built there. The first element is the verb which means &quot;to enjoy&quot; or &quot;to receive benefit from&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;island&quot;. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Nøtterø&quot;, using the Riksmal spelling. On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Nøtterøy&quot;. The letter &quot;y&quot; was added to the end of the word to &quot;Norwegianize&quot; the name ( is the Danish word for &quot;island&quot; and is the Norwegian word).

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 24 October 1986. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, an anchor argent in bend&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is an anchor that is displayed diagonally. The anchor has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue color and the anchor were both chosen to emphasize the importance of fishing and sailing in this island municipality. The anchor was used as the municipal symbol since the 17th century. The arms were designed by Truls Nygaard. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 

===Churches===

<text>Tjøme () is a former municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The island municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 2018. The area is now part of Færder Municipality. The administrative centre was the village of Tjøme. Other villages in Tjøme included Bjørnevåg, Grimestad, Hulebakk, Ormelet, Solvang, Sundene, and Svelvik.

At the time of its dissolution in 2017, the municipality was the 417th largest by area out of the 426 municipalities in Norway. Tjøme was the 212th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 4,928. The municipality&#x27;s population density was and its population had increased by 9.7% over the previous 10-year period.

The whole municipality was made up of a group of islands located to the south of Nøtterøy Municipality. The municipality included all of the island of Tjøme plus the smaller islands of Hvasser, Brøtsø, Hui, and Sandø. In addition to this, there were also about 475 smaller islands and skerries. The main island of Tjøme is the second-largest island in Vestfold County.

Tjøme was the childhood holiday destination for writer Roald Dahl.

==General information==
The parish of &quot;Tjømø&quot; (later spelled &quot;Tjøme&quot;) was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The borders of the municipality were never changed. On 1 January 2018, Tjøme municipality (population: 4,928) and Nøtterøy Municipality (population: 21,748) were merged to form the new Færder Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the island of Tjøme () since the first Tjøme Church was built there. The name is very old and its meaning is not certain. The name may be derived from the word which means &quot;bridle&quot; or &quot;rope&quot;, likely referring to the shape of the island. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Tjømø&quot;. On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Tjøme&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 17 February 1989. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, three oarlocks argent, 2 over 1&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a set of three oarlocks. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue color in the field symbolizes the importance of the sea for this island community. The oarlock was chosen as a symbol for the importance of fishing and trading for the municipality. There are three oarlocks to represent the three main islands: Tjøme, Hvasser, and Brøtsø. The arms were designed by Even Jarl Skoglund after winning a public competition to design the arms. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway had two parishes () within the municipality of Tjøme. It was part of the Tønsberg domprosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg.

==Geography==

Tjøme municipality was completely located on islands between the Tønsbergfjorden and the Ytre Oslofjord. The main island being the island of Tjøme, where the municipal centre Kirkebygda is located. This village was also were the shops, schools, and restaurants were located. There are a few other central areas on the islands such as Hvasser, with active fishermen as well as the tourist industry for the travelers passing through. Hvasser has an icebar, shops, petrol station, and a number of places to buy food and supplies.

There were approximately 4,600 permanent residents in Tjøme, but in the summer months that number rose to around 40,000 inhabitants, including the Norwegian royal family who have a summer house on Tjøme. The reason for the extreme increase is mainly the sea sports available in the area and the remarkably good weather. Summers in Tjøme are both warm and sunny, and the beaches are filled with locals and tourists. Tjøme has been nicknamed &quot;Sommerøya&quot; () because so many tourists, particularly from the Oslo area, visit the municipality.

Verdens Ende () lies at the southern tip of Tjøme Island, and has for years been visited by tourists. Tjøme is also a great place for hiking, even though they are limited by the size of the island. The spectacular seaside scenery can be seen all year round. Færder Lighthouse and the Store Færder Lighthouse were both located in Tjøme municipality.

==Government==
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

<text>Lardal () is a former municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 2018. The area is now part of Larvik Municipality. The administrative centre was the village of Svarstad. The village of Steinsholt was also part of Lardal.

Pikstein, the highest point in Lardal, is located in western Lardal along the Buskerud county border.

==General information==
The parish of &quot;Laurdal&quot; (later spelled &quot;Lardal&quot;) was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The municipality included the three sub-parishes of Svarstad, Styrvoll, and Hem. On 1 January 1983, an unpopulated area of Bergan, just south of Steinsholt, was transferred to Lardal from the neighboring municipality of Hedrum. On 9 January 1987, another unpopulated area was transferred to Lardal from the neighboring municipality of Hedrum. On 1 January 2018, the municipality of Lardal was merged into the neighboring Larvik Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Lardal valley (). The first element is the genitive case of which means &quot;water&quot; or &quot;river&quot; (referring to the local river Numedalslågen). The last element is which means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;. Prior to 1889, the name was spelled &quot;Laurdal&quot;. In 1889, the spelling was changed to &quot;Lardal&quot;. 

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 17 July 1992. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, a hulder Or&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is a hulder. The hulder has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The hulder is a part of old Scandinavian folklore. This was chosen to represent the large forested areas in Lardal that were said to be inhabited by hulder. The arms were designed by Arvid Steen. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway had three parishes () within the municipality of Lardal. It was part of the Larvik prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Tunsberg.

==Government==

While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality was under the jurisdiction of the Vestfold District Court and the Agder Court of Appeal.

<text>In space mission design, a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or geosynchronous transfer orbit is a highly elliptical type of geocentric orbit, usually with a perigee as low as low Earth orbit (LEO) and an apogee as high as geostationary orbit (GEO). Satellites that are destined for geosynchronous orbit (GSO) or GEO are often put into a GTO as an intermediate step for reaching their final orbit. Manufacturers of launch vehicles often advertise the amount of payload the vehicle can put into GTO.

==Background==

Geostationary and geosynchronous orbits are very desirable for many communication and Earth observation satellites. However, the delta-v, and therefore financial, cost to send a spacecraft to such orbits is very high due to their high orbital radius. A GTO is an intermediary orbit used to make this process more efficient. Satellite operators often use a high-thrust, low-efficiency launch vehicle to put their satellite into GTO, and then, after detaching the launch vehicle, use low-thrust, high-efficiency thrusters onboard the satellite itself to circularize its orbit (to GEO) over a longer period of time. This process is called spiral-out. This mission architecture is useful because it minimizes the mass that the spacecraft must push to GEO, allows for maximally efficient circularization burns taking advantage of the Oberth effect, and allows the spent launch vehicle to deorbit primarily through aerobraking due to its low perigee, minimizing its orbital lifetime. 

==Technical description==

GTO is a highly elliptical Earth orbit with an apogee (the point in the orbit of the moon or a satellite at which it is furthest from the earth) of , or a height of above sea level, which corresponds to the geostationary altitude. The period of a standard geosynchronous transfer orbit is about 10.5 hours. The argument of perigee is such that apogee occurs on or near the equator. Perigee can be anywhere above the atmosphere, but is usually restricted to a few hundred kilometers above the Earth&#x27;s surface to reduce launcher delta-V (formula_1) requirements and to limit the orbital lifetime of the spent booster so as to curtail space junk.

If using low-thrust engines such as electrical propulsion to get from the transfer orbit to geostationary orbit, the transfer orbit can be supersynchronous (having an apogee above the final geosynchronous orbit). However, this method takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit.
The typical launch vehicle injects the satellite to a supersynchronous orbit having the apogee above 42,164 km. The satellite&#x27;s low-thrust engines are thrusted continuously around the geostationary transfer orbits. The thrust direction and magnitude are usually determined to optimize the transfer time and/or duration while satisfying the mission constraints. The out-of-plane component of thrust is used to reduce the initial inclination set by the initial transfer orbit, while the in-plane component simultaneously raises the perigee and lowers the apogee of the intermediate geostationary transfer orbit. In case of using the Hohmann transfer orbit, only a few days are required to reach the geosynchronous orbit. By using low-thrust engines or electrical propulsion, months are required until the satellite reaches its final orbit.

The orbital inclination of a GTO is the angle between the orbit plane and the Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane. It is determined by the latitude of the launch site and the launch azimuth (direction). The inclination and eccentricity must both be reduced to zero to obtain a geostationary orbit. If only the eccentricity of the orbit is reduced to zero, the result may be a geosynchronous orbit but will not be geostationary. Because the formula_1 required for a plane change is proportional to the instantaneous velocity, the inclination and eccentricity are usually changed together in a single maneuver at apogee, where velocity is lowest.

The required formula_1 for an inclination change at either the ascending or descending node of the orbit is calculated as follows:
:formula_4

For a typical GTO with a semi-major axis of 24,582 km, perigee velocity is 9.88 km/s and apogee velocity is 1.64 km/s, clearly making the inclination change far less costly at apogee. In practice, the inclination change is combined with the orbital circularization (or &quot;apogee kick&quot;) burn to reduce the total formula_1 for the two maneuvers. The combined formula_1 is the vector sum of the inclination change formula_1 and the circularization formula_1, and as the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle will always exceed the remaining side&#x27;s length, total formula_1 in a combined maneuver will always be less than in two maneuvers. The combined formula_1 can be calculated as follows:
:formula_11

where formula_12 is the velocity magnitude at the apogee of the transfer orbit and formula_13 is the velocity in GEO.

==Other considerations==

Even at apogee, the fuel needed to reduce inclination to zero can be significant, giving equatorial launch sites a substantial advantage over those at higher latitudes. Russia&#x27;s Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan is at 46° north latitude. Kennedy Space Center in the United States is at 28.5° north. China&#x27;s Wenchang is at 19.5° north. India&#x27;s SDSC is at 13.7° north. Guiana Space Centre, the European Ariane and European-operated Russian Soyuz launch facility, is at 5° north. The &quot;indefinitely suspended&quot; Sea Launch launched from a floating platform directly on the equator in the Pacific Ocean.

Expendable launchers generally reach GTO directly, but a spacecraft already in a low Earth orbit (LEO) can enter GTO by firing a rocket along its orbital direction to increase its velocity. This was done when geostationary spacecraft were launched from the Space Shuttle; a &quot;perigee kick motor&quot; attached to the spacecraft ignited after the shuttle had released it and withdrawn to a safe distance.

Although some launchers can take their payloads all the way to geostationary orbit, most end their missions by releasing their payloads into GTO. The spacecraft and its operator are then responsible for the maneuver into the final geostationary orbit. The 5-hour coast to first apogee can be longer than the battery lifetime of the launcher or spacecraft, and the maneuver is sometimes performed at a later apogee or split among multiple apogees. The solar power available on the spacecraft supports the mission after launcher separation. Also, many launchers now carry several satellites in each launch to reduce overall costs, and this practice simplifies the mission when the payloads may be destined for different orbital positions.

Because of this practice, launcher capacity is usually quoted as spacecraft mass to GTO, and this number will be higher than the payload that could be delivered directly into GEO.

For example, the capacity (adapter and spacecraft mass) of the Delta IV Heavy is 14,200 kg to GTO, or 6,750 kg directly to geostationary orbit.

If the maneuver from GTO to GEO is to be performed with a single impulse, as with a single solid-rocket motor, apogee must occur at an equatorial crossing and at synchronous orbit altitude. This implies an argument of perigee of either 0° or 180°. Because the argument of perigee is slowly perturbed by the oblateness of the Earth, it is usually biased at launch so that it reaches the desired value at the appropriate time (for example, this is usually the sixth apogee on Ariane 5 launches). If the GTO inclination is zero, as with Sea Launch, then this does not apply. (It also would not apply to an impractical GTO inclined at 63.4°; see Molniya orbit.)

The preceding discussion has primarily focused on the case where the transfer between LEO and GEO is done with a single intermediate transfer orbit. More complicated trajectories are sometimes used. For example, the Proton-M uses a set of three intermediate orbits, requiring five upper-stage rocket firings, to place a satellite into GEO from the high-inclination site of Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan. Because of Baikonur&#x27;s high latitude and range safety considerations that block launches directly east, it requires less delta-v to transfer satellites to GEO by using a supersynchronous transfer orbit where the apogee (and the maneuver to reduce the transfer orbit inclination) are at a higher altitude than 35,786 km, the geosynchronous altitude. Proton even offers to perform a supersynchronous apogee maneuver up to 15 hours after launch.

The geostationary orbit is a special type of orbit around the Earth in which a satellite orbits the planet at the same rate as the Earth&#x27;s rotation. This means that the satellite appears to remain stationary relative to a fixed point on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The geostationary orbit is located at an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above the Earth&#x27;s equator.

<text>Mars Express is a space exploration mission being conducted by the European Space Agency (ESA). The &quot;Mars Express&quot; mission is exploring the planet Mars, and is the first planetary mission attempted by the agency. &quot;Express&quot; originally referred to the speed and efficiency with which the spacecraft was designed and built. However, &quot;Express&quot; also describes the spacecraft&#x27;s relatively short interplanetary voyage, a result of being launched when the orbits of Earth and Mars brought them closer than they had been in about 60,000 years.

&quot;Mars Express&quot; consists of two parts, the &quot;Mars Express Orbiter&quot; and &quot;Beagle 2&quot;, a lander designed to perform exobiology and geochemistry research. Although the lander failed to fully deploy after it landed on the Martian surface, the orbiter has been successfully performing scientific measurements since early 2004, namely, high-resolution imaging and mineralogical mapping of the surface, radar sounding of the subsurface structure down to the permafrost, precise determination of the atmospheric circulation and composition, and study of the interaction of the atmosphere with the interplanetary medium.

Due to the valuable science return and the highly flexible mission profile, &quot;Mars Express&quot; has been granted several mission extensions. The latest was approved on March 7, 2023, consisting of a confirmed operating period until December 31, 2026, and a further provisional extension to December 31, 2028. 

Some of the instruments on the orbiter, including the camera systems and some spectrometers, reuse designs from the failed launch of the Russian &quot;Mars 96&quot; mission in 1996 (European countries had provided much of the instrumentation and financing for that unsuccessful mission). The design of &quot;Mars Express&quot; is based on ESA&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission, on which a considerable sum was spent on development. The same design was also used for ESA&#x27;s &quot;Venus Express&quot; mission in order to increase reliability and reduce development cost and time. Because of these redesigns and repurposings, the total cost of the project was about $345 million- less than half of comparable U.S. missions.

Arriving at Mars in 2003, ago (and counting), it is the second longest surviving, continually active spacecraft in orbit around a planet other than Earth, behind only NASA&#x27;s still active &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot;.

== Mission profile and timeline overview ==
=== Mission overview ===
The &quot;Mars Express&quot; mission is dedicated to the orbital (and originally in-situ) study of the interior, subsurface, surface and atmosphere, and environment of the planet Mars.
The scientific objectives of the &quot;Mars Express&quot; mission represent an attempt to fulfill in part the lost scientific goals of the Russian Mars 96 mission, complemented by exobiology research with Beagle-2. Mars exploration is crucial for a better understanding of the Earth from the perspective of comparative planetology.

The spacecraft originally carried seven scientific instruments, a small lander, a lander relay and a Visual Monitoring Camera, all designed to contribute to solving the mystery of Mars&#x27; missing water. All of the instruments take measurements of the surface, atmosphere and interplanetary media, from the main spacecraft in polar orbit, which will allow it to gradually cover the whole planet.

The total initial &quot;Mars Express&quot; budget excluding the lander was €150 million. The prime contractor for the construction of &quot;Mars Express&quot; orbiter was EADS Astrium Satellites.

=== Mission preparation ===
In the years preceding the launch of a spacecraft numerous teams of experts distributed over the contributing companies and organisations prepared the space and ground segments. Each of these teams focussed on the area of its responsibility and interfacing as required. A major additional requirement raised for the Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) and all critical operational phases was that it was not enough merely to interface; the teams had to be integrated into one Mission Control Team. All the different experts had to work together in an operational environment and the interaction and interfaces between all elements of the system (software, hardware and human) had to run smoothly for this to happen:

* the flight operations procedures had to be written and validated down to the smallest detail;
* the control system had to be validated;
* system Validation Tests (SVTs) with the satellite had to be performed to demonstrate the correct interfacing of the ground and space segments;
* mission Readiness Test with the Ground Stations had to be performed;
* a Simulations Campaign was run.

=== Launch ===

The spacecraft was launched on June 2, 2003, at 23:45 local time (17:45 UT, 1:45 p.m. EDT) from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, using a Soyuz-FG/Fregat rocket. The &quot;Mars Express&quot; and Fregat booster were initially put into a 200 km Earth parking orbit, then the Fregat was fired again at 19:14 UT to put the spacecraft into a Mars transfer orbit. The Fregat and &quot;Mars Express&quot; separated at approximately 19:17 UT. The solar panels were then deployed and a trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on June 4 to aim &quot;Mars Express&quot; towards Mars and allow the Fregat booster to coast into interplanetary space. The &quot;Mars Express&quot; was the first Russian-launched probe to successfully make it out of low Earth orbit since the Soviet Union fell.

=== Near Earth commissioning phase ===
The Near Earth commissioning phase extended from the separation of the spacecraft from the launcher upper stage until the completion of the initial check out of the orbiter and payload. It included the solar array deployment, the initial attitude acquisition, the declamping of the Beagle-2 spin-up mechanism, the injection error correction manoeuvre and the first commissioning of the spacecraft and payload (final commissioning of payload took place after Mars Orbit Insertion). The payload was checked out one instrument at a time. This phase lasted about one month.

=== The interplanetary cruise phase ===
This five month phase lasted from the end of the Near Earth Commissioning phase until one month prior to the Mars capture manoeuvre and included trajectory correction manoeuvres and payloads calibration. The payload was mostly switched off during the cruise phase, with the exception of some intermediate check-outs.
Although it was originally meant to be a &quot;quiet cruise&quot; phase, It soon became obvious that this &quot;cruise&quot; would be indeed very busy. There were star tracker problems, a power wiring problem, extra manoeuvres, and on October 28, the spacecraft was hit by one of the largest solar flares ever recorded.
=== Lander jettison ===
The Beagle 2 lander was released on December 19, 2003, at 8:31 UTC (9:31 CET) on a ballistic cruise towards the surface. It entered Mars&#x27; atmosphere on the morning of December 25. Landing was expected to occur at about 02:45 UT on December 25 (9:45 p.m. EST December 24). However, after repeated attempts to contact the lander failed using the &quot;Mars Express&quot; craft and the NASA &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; orbiter, it was declared lost on February 6, 2004, by the Beagle 2 management board. An inquiry was held and its findings were published later that year.

=== Orbit insertion ===

&quot;Mars Express&quot; arrived at Mars after a 400 million km journey and course corrections in September and in December 2003.

On December 20 &quot;Mars Express&quot; fired a short thruster burst to put it into position to orbit the planet. The &quot;Mars Express&quot; orbiter then fired its main engine and went into a highly elliptical initial-capture orbit of 250 km × 150,000 km with an inclination of 25 degrees on December 25 at 03:00 UT (10:00 p.m., December 24 EST).

First evaluation of the orbital insertion showed that the orbiter had reached its first milestone at Mars. The orbit was later adjusted by four more main engine firings to the desired 259 km × 11,560 km near-polar (86 degree inclination) orbit with a period of 7.5 hours. Near periapsis (nearest to Mars) the top deck is pointed down towards the Martian surface and near apoapsis (farthest from Mars in its orbit) the high gain antenna will be pointed towards Earth for uplink and downlink.

After 100 days the apoapsis was lowered to 10,107 km and periapsis raised to 298 km to give an orbital period of 6.7 hours.

=== MARSIS deployment ===
On May 4, 2005, &quot;Mars Express&quot; deployed the first of its two 20-metre-long radar booms for its MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) experiment. At first the boom did not lock fully into place; however, exposing it to sunlight for a few minutes on May 10 fixed the glitch. The second 20 m boom was successfully deployed on June 14. Both 20 m booms were needed to create a 40 m dipole antenna for MARSIS to work; a less crucial 7-meter-long monopole antenna was deployed on June 17. The radar booms were originally scheduled to be deployed in April 2004, but this was delayed out of fear that the deployment could damage the spacecraft through a whiplash effect. Due to the delay it was decided to split the four-week commissioning phase in two parts, with two weeks running up to July 4 and another two weeks in December 2005.

The deployment of the booms was a critical and highly complex task requiring effective inter-agency cooperation ESA, NASA, industry and public universities.

Nominal science observations began during July 2005.

=== Operations of the spacecraft ===
Operations for &quot;Mars Express&quot; are carried out by a multinational team of engineers from ESA&#x27;s Operation Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt. The team began preparations for the mission about 3 to 4 years prior to the actual launch. This involved preparing the ground segment and the operational procedures for the whole mission.

The Mission Control Team is composed of the Flight Control Team, Flight Dynamics Team, Ground Operations Managers, Software Support and Ground Facilities Engineers. All of these are located at ESOC but there are additionally external teams, such as the Project and Industry Support teams, who designed and built the spacecraft.
The Flight Control Team currently consists of:

* The Spacecraft Operations Manager
* Six Operations Engineers (including three Mission Planners)
* One Spacecraft Analyst
* Six spacecraft controllers (SpaCons), shared with ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, BepiColombo and Solar Orbiter.

The team build-up, headed by the Spacecraft Operations Manager, started about four years before launch. He was required to recruit a suitable team of engineers that could handle the varying tasks involved in the mission. For &quot;Mars Express&quot; the engineers came from various other missions. Most of them had been involved with Earth orbiting satellites.

=== Routine phase: science return ===
Since orbit insertion &quot;Mars Express&quot; has been progressively fulfilling its original scientific goals. Nominally the spacecraft points to Mars while acquiring science and then slews to Earth-pointing to downlink the data, although some instruments like Marsis or Radio Science might be operated while spacecraft is Earth-pointing.

== Orbiter and subsystems ==

=== Structure ===
The &quot;Mars Express&quot; orbiter is a cube-shaped spacecraft with two solar panel wings extending from opposite sides. The launch mass of 1223 kg includes a main bus with 113 kg of payload, the 60 kg lander, and 457 kg of propellant. The main body is 1.5 m × 1.8 m × 1.4 m in size, with an aluminium honeycomb structure covered by an aluminium skin. The solar panels measure about 12 m tip-to-tip. Two 20 m long wire dipole antennas extend from opposite side faces perpendicular to the solar panels as part of the radar sounder.

=== Propulsion ===
The Soyuz/Fregat launcher provided most of the thrust &quot;Mars Express&quot; needed to reach Mars. The final stage of the Soyuz, Fregat was jettisoned once the probe was safely on a course for Mars. The spacecraft&#x27;s on-board means of propulsion was used to slow the probe for Mars orbit insertion and subsequently for orbit corrections.

The body is built around the main propulsion system, which consists of a bipropellant 400 N main engine. The two 267-liter propellant tanks have a total capacity of 595 kg. Approximately 370 kg are needed for the nominal mission. Pressurized helium from a 35-liter tank is used to force fuel into the engine. Trajectory corrections will be made using a set of eight 10 N thrusters, one attached to each corner of the spacecraft bus. The spacecraft configuration is optimized for a Soyuz/Fregat, and was fully compatible with a Delta II launch vehicle.

=== Power ===
Spacecraft power is provided by the solar panels which contain 11.42 square meters of silicon cells. The originally planned power was to be 660W at 1.5AU but a faulty connection has reduced the amount of power available by 30%, to about 460W. This loss of power does not significantly affect the science return of the mission. Power is stored in three lithium-ion batteries with a total capacity of 64.8Ah for use during eclipses. The power is fully regulated at 28V, and the Terma power module (also used in &quot;Rosetta&quot;) is redundant. During routine phase, the spacecraft&#x27;s power consumption is in the range of 450–550W.

=== Attitude control - avionics ===
Attitude control (3-axis stabilization) is achieved using two 3-axis inertial measurement units, a set of two star cameras and two Sun sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and four 12 N·m·s reaction wheels. Pointing accuracy is 0.04 degree with respect to the inertial reference frame and 0.8 degree with respect to the Mars orbital frame. Three on-board systems help &quot;Mars Express&quot; maintain a very precise pointing accuracy, which is essential to allow the spacecraft to use some of the science instruments.

=== Communications ===
The communications subsystem is composed of three antennas: A 1.6 m diameter parabolic dish high-gain antenna and two omnidirectional antennas. The first one provide links (telecommands uplink and telemetry downlink) in both X-band (8.4 GHz) and S-band (2.1 GHz) and is used during nominal science phase around Mars. The low gain antennas are used during launch and early operations to Mars and for eventual contingencies once in orbit. Two Mars lander relay UHF antennas are mounted on the top face for communication with the &quot;Beagle 2&quot; or other landers, using a Melacom transceiver.

==== Earth stations ====
Although communications with Earth were originally scheduled to take place with the ESA 35-meter wide Ground Station in New Norcia (Australia) New Norcia Station, the mission profile of progressive enhancement and science return flexibility have triggered the use of the ESA ESTRACK Ground Stations in Cebreros Station, Madrid, Spain and Malargüe Station, Argentina.

In addition, further agreements with NASA Deep Space Network have made possible the use of American stations for nominal mission planning, thus increasing complexity but with a clear positive impact in scientific returns.

This inter-agency cooperation has proven effective, flexible and enriching for both sides. On the technical side, it has been made possible (among other reasons) thanks to the adoption of both Agencies of the Standards for Space Communications defined in CCSDS.

=== Thermal ===
Thermal control is maintained through the use of radiators, multi-layer insulation, and actively controlled heaters. The spacecraft must provide a benign environment for the instruments and on-board equipment. Two instruments, PFS and OMEGA, have infrared detectors that need to be kept at very low temperatures (about −180 °C). The sensors on the camera (HRSC) also need to be kept cool. But the rest of the instruments and on-board equipment function best at room temperatures (10–20 °C).

The spacecraft is covered in gold-plated aluminium-tin alloy thermal blankets to maintain a temperature of 10–20 °C inside the spacecraft. The instruments that operate at low temperatures to be kept cold are thermally insulated from this relatively high internal temperature, and emit excess heat into space using attached radiators.

=== Control unit and data storage ===
The spacecraft is run by two Control and Data management Units with 12 gigabits of solid state mass memory for storage of data and housekeeping information for transmission. The on-board computers control all aspects of the spacecraft functioning including switching instruments on and off, assessing the spacecraft orientation in space and issuing commands to change it.

Another key aspect of the &quot;Mars Express&quot; mission is its artificial intelligence tool (MEXAR2). The primary purpose of the AI tool is the scheduling of when to download various parts of the collected scientific data back to Earth, a process which used to take ground controllers a significant amount of time. The new AI tool saves operator time, optimizes bandwidth use on the DSN, prevents data loss, and allows better use of the DSN for other space operations as well. The AI decides how to manage the spacecraft&#x27;s 12 gigabits of storage memory, when the DSN will be available and not be in use by another mission, how to make the best use of the DSN bandwidth allocated to it, and when the spacecraft will be oriented properly to transmit back to Earth.

=== Lander ===
The &quot;Beagle 2&quot; lander objectives were to characterize the landing site geology, mineralogy, and geochemistry, the physical properties of the atmosphere and surface layers, collect data on Martian meteorology and climatology, and search for possible signatures of life on Mars. However, the landing attempt was unsuccessful and the lander was declared lost. A Commission of Inquiry on &quot;Beagle 2&quot; identified several possible causes, including airbag problems, severe shocks to the lander&#x27;s electronics which had not been simulated adequately before launch, and problems with parts of the landing system colliding; but was unable to reach any firm conclusions. The spacecraft&#x27;s fate remained a mystery until it was announced in January 2015 that NASA&#x27;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, using HiRISE, had found the probe intact on the surface of Mars. It was then determined that an error had prevented two of the spacecraft&#x27;s four solar panels from deploying, blocking the spacecraft&#x27;s communications. &quot;Beagle 2&quot; was the first British and first European probe to achieve a landing on Mars.

== Scientific instruments ==
The scientific objectives of the &quot;Mars Express&quot; payload are to obtain global high-resolution photo-geology (10 m resolution), mineralogical mapping (100 m resolution) and mapping of the atmospheric composition, study the subsurface structure, the global atmospheric circulation, and the interaction between the atmosphere and the subsurface, and the atmosphere and the interplanetary medium. The total mass budgeted for the science payload is 116 kg. The payload scientific instruments are:

* Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer (OMEGA) (Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l&#x27;Eau, les Glaces et l&#x27;Activité) – France – Determines mineral composition of the surface up to 100 m resolution. Is mounted inside pointing out the top face. Instrument mass: 28.6 kg
* Ultraviolet and Infrared Atmospheric Spectrometer (SPICAM) – France – Assesses elemental composition of the atmosphere. Is mounted inside pointing out the top face. Instrument mass: 4.7 kg
* Sub-Surface Sounding Radar Altimeter (MARSIS) – Italy – A radar altimeter used to assess composition of sub-surface aimed at search for frozen water. Is mounted in the body and is nadir pointing, and also incorporates the two 20 m antennas. Instrument mass: 13.7 kg
* Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (PFS) – Italy – Makes observations of atmospheric temperature and pressure (observations suspended in September 2005). Is mounted inside pointing out the top face and is currently working. Instrument mass: 30.8 kg
* Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA) – Sweden – Investigates interactions between upper atmosphere and solar wind. Is mounted on the top face. Instrument mass: 7.9 kg
* High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) – Germany – Produces color images with up to 2 m resolution. Is mounted inside the spacecraft body, aimed through the top face of the spacecraft, which is nadir pointing during Mars operations. Instrument mass: 20.4 kg
* Mars Express Lander Communications (MELACOM) – UK – Allows &quot;Mars Express&quot; to act as a communication relay for landers on the Martian surface. (Has been used on both Mars Exploration Rovers, and was used to support the landing of NASA&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission)
* Mars Radio Science Experiment (MaRS) – Uses radio signals to investigate atmosphere, surface, subsurface, gravity and solar corona density during solar conjunctions. It uses the communications subsystem itself.
* Visual Monitoring Camera, a small camera to monitor the lander ejection.

== Scientific discoveries and important events ==
For more than 20,000 orbits, &quot;Mars Express&quot; payload instruments have been nominally and regularly operated. The HRSC camera has been consistently mapping the Martian surface with unprecedented resolution and has acquired multiple images.

=== 2004 ===
* January 23
:: ESA announced the discovery of water ice in the south polar ice cap, using data collected by the OMEGA instrument.

* January 28
:: &quot;Mars Express&quot; orbiter reaches final science orbit altitude around Mars.

* March 17
:: Orbiter detects polar ice caps that contain 85% carbon dioxide (CO2) ice and 15% water ice.

* March 30
:: A press release announces that the orbiter has detected methane in the Martian atmosphere. Although the amount is small, about 10 parts in a thousand million, it has excited scientists to question its source. Since methane is removed from the Martian atmosphere very rapidly, there must be a current source that replenishes it. Because one of the possible sources could be microbial life, it is planned to verify the reliability of these data and especially watch for difference in the concentration in various places on Mars. It is hoped that the source of this gas can be discovered by finding its location of release.

* April 28
:: ESA announced that the deployment of the boom carrying the radar-based MARSIS antenna was delayed. It described concerns with the motion of the boom during deployment, which can cause the spacecraft to be struck by elements of it. Further investigations are planned to make sure that this will not happen.

* July 15
:: Scientists working with the PFS instrument announced that they tentatively discovered the spectral features of the compound ammonia in the Martian atmosphere. Just like methane discovered earlier (see above), ammonia breaks down rapidly in Mars&#x27; atmosphere and needs to be constantly replenished. This points towards the existence of active life or geological activity; two contending phenomena whose presence so far have remained undetected.

=== 2005 ===
* In 2005, ESA scientists reported that the OMEGA (Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer)(Observatoire pour la Minéralogie, l&#x27;Eau, les Glaces et l&#x27;Activité) instrument data indicates the presence of hydrated sulphates, silicates and various rock-forming minerals.
* February 8
:: The delayed deployment of the MARSIS antenna has been given a green light by ESA. It is planned to take place in early May 2005.

* May 5
:: The first boom of the MARSIS antenna was successfully deployed. At first, there was no indication of any problems, but later it was discovered that one segment of the boom did not lock. The deployment of the second boom was delayed to allow for further analysis of the problem.

* May 11
:: Using the Sun&#x27;s heat to expand the segments of the MARSIS antenna, the last segment locked in successfully.

* June 14
:: The second boom was deployed, and on June 16 ESA announced it was a success.
* June 22
:: ESA announces that MARSIS is fully operational and will soon begin acquiring data. This comes after the deployment of the third boom on June 17, and a successful transmission test on June 19.

=== 2006 ===
* September 21
:: The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) has obtained images of the Cydonia region, the location of the famous &quot;Face on Mars&quot;. The massif became famous in a photo taken in 1976 by the American &quot;Viking 1&quot; Orbiter. The image recorded with a ground resolution of approximately 13.7 metres per pixel.

* September 26
:: The &quot;Mars Express&quot; spacecraft emerged from an unusually demanding eclipse introducing a special, ultra-low-power mode nicknamed &#x27;Sumo&#x27; – an innovative configuration aimed at saving the power necessary to ensure spacecraft survival.
::This mode was developed through teamwork between ESOC mission controllers, principal investigators, industry, and mission management.

* October
:: In October 2006 the &quot;Mars Express&quot; spacecraft encountered a superior solar conjunction (alignment of Earth-Sun-Mars-orbiter). The angle Sun-Earth-orbiter reached a minimum on October 23 at 0.39° at a distance of 2.66 AU. Operational measures were undertaken to minimize the impact of the link degradation, since the higher density of electrons in the solar plasma heavily impacts the radio frequency signal.

* December
:: Following the loss of NASA&#x27;s &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; (MGS), &quot;Mars Express&quot; team was requested to perform actions in the hopes of visually identifying the American spacecraft. Based on last ephemeris of MGS provided by JPL, the on-board high definition HRSC camera swept a region of the MGS orbit. Two attempts were made to find the craft, both unsuccessful.

=== 2007 ===

* January
:: First agreements with NASA undertaken for the support by &quot;Mars Express&quot; on the landing of the American lander &quot;Phoenix&quot; in May 2008.

* February
:: The small camera VMC (used only once to monitor the lander ejection) was recommissioned and first steps were taken to offer students the possibility to participate in a campaign &quot;Command Mars Express Spacecraft and take your own picture of Mars&quot;.

* February 23
:: As result of the science return, the Science Program Committee (SPC) granted a mission extension until May 2009.

* June 28
:: The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) has produced images of key tectonic features in Aeolis Mensae.

=== 2008 ===
* The Mars Express Team was the winner of the Sir Arthur Clarke Award for Best Team Achievement.

=== 2009 ===

*October 7
::ESA&#x27;s Science Programme Committee has approved the extension of mission operations for &quot;Mars Express&quot; until December 31, 2012.

=== 2010 ===
*March 5
::Flyby of Phobos to measure Phobos&#x27; gravity.

=== 2011 ===
*August 13
::Safe mode following a Solid-State Mass Memory problem.
*August 23
::Solid-State Mass Memory problem.
*September 23
::Safe mode following a Solid-State Mass Memory problem.
*October 11
::Solid-State Mass Memory problem.
*October 16
::Safe mode following a Solid-State Mass Memory problem.
*November 24
::Science operations are resumed using the Short Mission Timeline and Command Files instead of the Long Time Line resident on the suspect Solid-State Mass Memory.

=== 2012 ===
* February 16
::Resumes full science operations. There is still enough fuel for up to 14 additional years of operation.
* July
::Solar corona studied with radio waves.
* August 5/6
:: Assisted US probes &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; in data collection and transfer on the Mars Science Laboratory landing.

=== 2013 ===
*&quot;Mars Express&quot; produced a near-complete topographical map of Mars&#x27; surface.
*December 29
::&quot;Mars Express&quot; performed the closest flyby to date of Phobos
=== 2014 ===
* October 19
::ESA reported &quot;Mars Express&quot; was healthy after the Comet Siding Spring flyby of Mars on October 19, 2014 — as were all NASA Mars orbiters and ISRO&#x27;s orbiter, the Mars Orbiter Mission.

=== 2016 ===
* October 19
:: Assisted with data collection and transfer for the Schiaparelli EDM lander landing.
===2017===
*June 19
::Takes noted image spanning from the North Pole up to Alba Mons and even farther south. The image was released in December 20, 2017, and was captured by HRSC.

===2018===
*Activated new AOCMS software which includes a gyroless attitude estimator to prolong the lifetime of the spacecraft&#x27;s laser gyros
*July 2018, a discovery is reported based on MARSIS radar studies, of a subglacial lake on Mars, below the southern polar ice cap, and about wide, the first known stable body of water on Mars.
* December 2018 &quot;Mars Express&quot; relays images of the 80-kilometer wide Korolev Crater filled with approximately 2200 cubic kilometers of water ice on the Martian surface. Based on further evidence the crater ice is still part of much vaster ice resources at Mars poles.

===2019===
*Based on data from the HRSC camera, there is geological evidence of an ancient planet-wide groundwater system.

===2020===
*Sept 2020, a discovery is reported based on MARSIS radar studies, of a three more subglacial lakes on Mars, below the southern polar ice cap. The size of the first lake found, and the largest, has been corrected to wide. It is surrounded by 3 smaller lakes, each a few kilometres wide.

<text>Siljan is a municipality in Telemark county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Grenland. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Siljan. Other villages in Siljan include Snurråsen and Øverbø.

The municipality is the 299th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Siljan is the 261st most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,375. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 2.1% over the previous 10-year period.

The older main road that connects the cities of Skien, Larvik, and Oslo passes through Siljan.

==General information==
The parish of &quot;Slemdal&quot; (later renamed &quot;Siljan&quot;) was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, a small area (population: 16) of Hedrum Municipality in Vestfold county was transferred to Siljan Municipality in Telemark county. Again on 1 January 1968, the unpopulated Svartangen area was transferred from Hedrum to Siljan.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) was originally named &quot;Slemdal&quot;, after the local valley (). The first element is likely the old name of a river, the meaning of which is uncertain. The last element is which means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;.

On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the name of the municipality to &quot;Siljan&quot;. This name comes from the old &quot;Siljan&quot; farm () since the first Siljan Church was built there. The name&#x27;s meaning is uncertain, but it is likely that it comes from the plura form of which means &quot;sallow tree&quot; or &quot;willow&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 16 June 1989. The official blazon is &quot;Vert, three saw blades argent palewise in fess&quot; (). This means the arms have a green field (background) and the charge is a set of three saw blades standing vertically in a horizontal row. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The green color in the field and the saw blade design symbolize the importance of the timber industry in Siljan. This type of saw blade was used locally throughout history. There were many saw mills located in Siljan along its waterways. The arms were designed by Halvor Holtskog, Jr. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

<doc id="178285" wikidata="Q1881" url="?curid=178285" title="Fyresdal">
<text>Fyresdal is a municipality in Telemark county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Vest-Telemark. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Moland. Other villages in Fyresdal include Kilegrend, Øvre Birtedalen, and Øyane.

The municipality is the 78th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Fyresdal is the 317th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 1,224. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 9.3% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==
The parish of &quot;Moland&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1879, the name of the municipality was changed to &quot;Fyresdal&quot;. The borders of the municipality have never changed, something which is pretty unusual in Norway.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) was first named after the old &quot;Moland&quot; farm () since the first Moland Church was built there. The first element is which means &quot;moorland&quot; or &quot;heath&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;land&quot; or &quot;district&quot;.

On 28 June 1879, a royal resolution changed the name of the municipality to &quot;Fyresdal&quot;. This name () was chosen since it is the name of the valley in which the municipality is located. The first element of this name is the genitive case of the name of the local lake Fyresvatnet (). The name of the lake is derived from the word which means &quot;pine tree&quot;. The last element of the name is which means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 24 April 1992. The official blazon is &quot;Vert two bendwise axes argent in pale&quot; (). This means the arms have a green field (background) and the charge is a broadaxe. The broadaxes have a tincture of argent which means it is colored white most of the time, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The green color in the field and the broadaxe were chosen to symbolize the importance of forestry in the municipality. The arms were the result of a local competition, which resulted in 42 different proposals being submitted. The winning design for the arms was submitted by Halvor Holtskog Jr. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Fyresdal. It is part of the Øvre Telemark prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark.

==History==
Fyresdal is known for its many findings from the Viking Age, its mighty Viking graves, heaps of slag, and the former Heggland pilgrim church that once stood proudly north of the village centre. People traveled to this church from all over Norway and even from Europe. It was said that the stream running behind the church had healing powers.

A few miles south of the site where the Heggland Pilgrim Church (), once stood at &quot;Molandsmoen&quot;, a stone with Runic inscriptions can be found. This is a reminder from the Viking Age when horse battles were held there. Originally, one believes, there were four of them. 
&quot;Klokkarhamaren&quot; is a little mountain on a peninsula in the municipal centre, and it is the location of a cave called &quot;Munkhola&quot;. It is believed that a certain number of monks in medieval times resided, held masses, and sought refuge here.

==Government==
Fyresdal Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Telemark District Court and the Agder Court of Appeal.

===Municipal council===

*1999-2007: Saamund Gjersund (LL)
*2007-2011: Bjørn Fredrik Nome (Sp)
*2011–present: Erik Skjervagen (Ap)

==Economy==
Most people in the municipality work in the fields of agriculture, forestry, trade, industry, and tourism. There are not many full-time farmers left in Fyresdal, but many people derive a secondary income from agriculture and forestry.

The largest employer in the municipality is Telemark Kildevann which makes bottled water and soft drinks for the national and Swedish markets. There are also a few small high-competence mechanical factories which produce parts for the offshore industry.

==Transportation==

The Vest-Telemark airport, Fyresdal is located in Moland, with a nearby hotel. This is a joint operation under the name &quot;Airparc Fyresdal&quot;. Fyresdal has bus connections with the town centres of Skien and Porsgrunn in Telemark county; Arendal in Agder county; Bergen in Vestland county; Haugesund in Rogaland county; and to the capital, Oslo. A bus also travels every school day of the year between Fyresdal and Dalen, the municipal centre of the neighboring Tokke Municipality.

==Geography==
The municipality of Fyresdal consists of several little villages north of Moland, in the main valley of Fyresdal, and on the western and southeastern shores of Fyresvatnet, one of Norway&#x27;s deepest lakes. Moland is the location of the municipal council, the school, the community house, kindergartens, the home for the elderly, and most of the commercial enterprises in the municipality. Moland is the most heavily populated aea of Fyresdal.

Fyresdal is among the westernmost municipalities in Telemark. It borders the municipalities of Tokke, Kviteseid, and Nissedal in Telemark county. It also shares borders with the municipalities of Åmli, Bygland, and Valle in Agder county.

==Attractions==
*One of Fyresdal&#x27;s two churches (Moland Church) and the vicarage (&quot;Fyresdal Prestegard&quot;) are located in Moland. According to Telemark folklore, the &quot;Troll of Røykjenes&quot; moved across the lake because the bells of the Moland Church were disturbing its nap. The vicarage is where Vidkun Quisling was born.
*Within the administrative center of Moland, one also finds the old village centre, &quot;Folkestadbyen&quot;. Folkestadbyen is the location of the &quot;Fyresdal Vertshus&quot;, a Swiss-styled dwelling built in 1890. It has housed and served both food and drinks to locals and travellers for over 100 years. &quot;Øyskogen&quot; park, which contains Viking graves and a lot of traditional Telemark houses &quot;(e.g. lofts and stabburs)&quot; is also part of the old village. The &quot;Fyresdal Bygdemuseum&quot;, the village museum, is also located in Øyskogen. 
*&quot;Fv 355&quot; runs straight through the municipality from north to south. &quot;Hegglandsgrend&quot;, &quot;Veum&quot;, and &quot;Hauggrend&quot; are villages along Fv 355 located north of Moland. Hegglandsgrend is the home of &quot;Heggland Gamle Kyrkjegard&quot;; Veum is the home of Veum Church. A &quot;Rudolf Steiner School&quot; (an upper secondary level school) was located at &quot;Foldsæ&quot; in Hauggrend. This so-called &quot;friskole&quot; (&quot;Free school&quot;) based on the thoughts and ideas of Rudolf Steiner was however closed down after few years. In Hauggrend, one also finds the most distinct mountain in Fyresdal, &quot;Roan&quot;. This peak is above sea level, but not the highest point in the municipality, since the border to Valle passes near the peak of &quot;Napuren&quot;, at a height of above sea level, some 300 feet higher.
*North of Moland, to the west from the main valley we find the little settlements of &quot;Kleivgrend&quot;, &quot;Åslandsgrend&quot;. Turning left of the Fv 355 in Hegglandsgrend, one comes to Kleivgrend and Åslandsgrend. Between Kleivgrend and the neighbouring municipality Valle on the western side of the mountains, one finds an old track that priests and bishops used to get between the counties of Agder and Telemark. This track is named &quot;Bispevegen&quot; (&quot;Bishop&#x27;s Road&quot;) and every year a march called &quot;Bispevegmarsjen&quot; (&quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Road March&quot;) starts in Kleivgrend. In Fjellgardane, Germans ran mines in the 16th century at &quot;Moisesberg&quot;.
*On the western shores of the lake Fyresvatnet, to the southwest of Moland, one finds the villages of &quot;Fardal&quot;, &quot;Breivik&quot;. Here one finds an old and interesting stone called &quot;Røykjenessteinen&quot;. In 2005, one also found some arrowheads in this area that are believed to be 4000–4500 years old. Farther along the country road we find &quot;Øvre Birtedalen&quot;, a popular place for people to have mountain cabins.
*South of Moland, at the southern end of Fv 355 across the scenic and mighty mountain of &quot;Våmur&quot; where one can see the lake from up above, one comes to the little village of Kilegrend. In the old days, there was no road connecting Kilegrend with the municipal centre. Thus one had to travel by boat. For years the steamboats called &quot;Teisner&quot; and &quot;Fyresdølen&quot; travelled between Moland and Kilegrend. The latter eventually capsized and sank. The wreck is still visible in Kilegrend.

Nissedal has been nicknamed the &quot;Telemark Riviera&quot; for its close proximity to Gautefall Alpine Center and for its many campgrounds and outdoor activities. There are a total of 1,750 lakes in Nissedal, including Nisser, the seventh-largest lake in Norway, which Nissedal is named after. Gautefall, which is home to Telemark County&#x27;s largest alpine center, lies adjacent to the municipality. For residents of the Oslo Fjord area, Gautefall is the nearest winter sport destination.

It is recognized as one of Norway’s best places for mountain climbing. Nissedal is home to Hægefjell, one of Norway&#x27;s most popular mountain climbing destinations.

==General information==
Nissedal was originally a part of the Kviteseid parish until Nissedal established its own parish in 1810. The parish of Nissedal was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the Espestøl area (population: 7) of Åmli Municipality in Aust-Agder county was transferred to Nissedal Municipality in Telemark county. Then again on 1 January 1965, the unpopulated Espestøl, Reinefoss, and Espestølstykket areas of Åmli Municipality in Aust-Agder county was transferred to Nissedal Municipality in Telemark county. The borders have not changed since that time.

=== Etymology ===

The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Nissedalen valley () since the first Nissedal Church was built in the valley. Nissedal was first mentioned in a written source in the 1300s under the name &quot;Nizudal&quot;. The current written form first emerged in the 1400s. The first element of the municipal name comes from the local lake Nisser, which was historically spelled &quot;Nizir&quot;. The first element is the lake name comes from the local river , the old name for the river Nidelva. The last element of the lake name is which means &quot;inland sea&quot; or &quot;large lake&quot;. Thus it is &quot;the inland sea that feeds the river Nidelva&quot;. The last element of the municipal name is which means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;.

Today, the name Nissedal refers to three geographical areas: 1) the municipality of Nissedal, 2) the Nissedal parish in the Church of Norway which includes the villages on both sides of the lake Nisser, and 3) the villages of Nordbygda and Kyrkjebygda that are jointly referred to as &quot;Nissedal village&quot;.

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms was granted on 30 October 1992. The official blazon is &quot;Or, three nisse hats gules&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The charge is a set of three &quot;nisseluer&quot;, traditional red woolen hats often associated with the nisse, which were commonly worn until the late 19th century by farmers and common folk. It is a canting arms, since the name &quot;Nissedal&quot; has been &quot;translated&quot; into a visual pun with the three woolen hats, in spite of the name having nothing to do with the folkloric nisse. The arms were designed by Halvor Holtskog Jr. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Nissedal. It is part of the Øvre Telemark prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark.

==History==

Nissedal has been populated for over 10,000 years. It was likely one of the first areas in Telemark to be inhabited, likely by people migrating from the south and southwest after the Ice Age. Most artifacts retrieved in Nissedal are dated to the Iron Age. However, older traces such as cairns, arrowheads, and stone axes have also been retrieved. Two ancient rock paintings can still be seen on the western shore of Lake Nisser, including paintings at Kvithamar by Fjone and at Trontveit further south. Bronze Age artifacts include swords and keys, while there are large burial mounds found in Fjone (&quot;Kjempehaugane&quot;). The ancient burial mounds have a diameter of 15–20 meters and are dated to the Iron Age.

One of the earliest areas to be populated in Nissedal was the cave Holmevasshelleren, approximately from the lake Holmevatn at Kyrkjebygdheia. Archeological discoveries have dated prehistoric settlements at Holmevasshelleren to Neolithic times, 3800 BCE-6000 BCE. The cave is long, high, and deep.

Ancient rock paintings from the Bronze Age can be seen at various sites in Nissedal, including by a steep mountain by Trontveit farm on the western side of the lake Nisser. Such paintings are also found by Kvithamar further north. The rock art site at Kvithammaren (&quot;The White Crag&quot;) is named for the site where it is painted, namely a white niche in the mountainside, roughly above the surface of Nisser Lake, at the foot of a high cliff. It is easily visible from distance and may have been seen as openings in Earth and a link to the underworld. The other rock painting by Nisser Lake is known as (&quot;The Oven&quot;) and is located at the foot of a high escarpment which originally jutted up in front of the panel. This painting depicts a row of human figures, an animal pictograph, and a pattern of zigzag lines. A local clergyman visited the paintings in the early 1800s and claimed the human figures at Ovnen to have been drawn by a monk in the memory of a bridal procession that drowned. Their colloquial name, (&quot;The Monk’s Drawings&quot;), is a reference to this. The paintings at Ovnen are naturally filled in iron oxides.

An ancient archeological monument from the Bronze Age, dating to 1800 BCE-500 BCE, can also be seen by Stolsvasslonene. It is a solar symbol of a sun wheel which is 40-centimeter in diameter. It can be reached by hiking the DNT trail between Uvdalen and Gautefall. It is likely an ancient symbol of fertility and possibly related to the nearby lake.

&quot;Heigeitilen&quot;, a boundary marker on the border between the three historic parishes of Tørdal, Nissedal, and Treungen, was first mentioned in written sources in 1792. It is likely an ancient marker and can be reached from the Heigeitilløypa trail (Heigeitilstien). It is a Milky Quartz mineral rock.

The Uvdalen valley has been populated since the Stone Age. Protected from the wind by the mountain Heitfjell, the area was likely inhabited for hundreds of years. Archeological surveys here have retrieved various artifacts from the Stone Age, including arrowheads and flint tools. The first written record of inhabitants in Uvdalen dates to 1574, while the last permanent inhabitants left the valley in 1910. The 1733 census indicates that Bjørn Alvson and his wife Torbjørg lived on a farm here with nine cows, 42 sheep, 16 goats, and two horses, among other animals. The 1865 census showed a total population of 24 in Uvdalen. Uvdalen was once home to one of the largest farms in Treungen.

Reinsvasshytta by the lake Reinsvatn was built in 1900 by Amboritius Olsen Lindvig and was Gautefallheia&#x27;s first cabin.

<text>Hjartdal is a municipality in Telemark county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Upper Telemark and Aust-Telemark. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Sauland. Other villages in the municipality include Tuddal and Hjartdalsbygda.

The municipality is the 146th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Hjartdal is the 299th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 1,588. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 1.3% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==
The municipality of &quot;Hierdal&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). In 1860, the Gransherad area of eastern Hjartdal (population: 1,310) was separated to become part of the new Gransherad Municipality. Also in 1860, the administrative centre of the municipality was moved from Hjartdalsbygda to Sauland. On 23 January 1905, a small, unpopulated area of Hjartdal was transferred to the neighboring Seljord Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the valley name, Hjartdalen () since the first Hjartdal Church was built there. The first element is the old name for the local river Hjartdøla. The old river name is likely derived from the word which means &quot;red deer&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;. Prior to the 20th century, the name was often spelled &quot;Hierdal&quot;, a corruption of the original name. In the 20th century, the spelling was standardized to &quot;Hjartdal&quot;, bringing back more of the original spelling.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 17 February 1989. The official blazon is &quot;Vert, a deer at bay argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a green field (background) and the charge is a red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;) standing at bay. The deer has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. They are canting arms because the name of the municipality is derived from the word for deer, a common animal in the rural municipality. The color green was chosen to represent the forests in the area. The arms were designed by Svein G. Carlsen. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Hjartdal. It is part of the Øvre Telemark prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark.

==History==
Up to the 1500s, the Hjartdal parish had been quite large. It stretched from Rauland in the west and Kongsberg to the east. Counting from west to east, the villages of Åmotsdal, Svartdal, Hjartdal, Tuddal, Sauland, Gransherad, Bolkesjø, Jondalen and Lisleherad were all at one point included in the same parish. Sometime after 1687 Lisleherad was transferred to the partish of Heddal. Then in 1860, the Gransherad area was separated. Today, the Hjartdal parish and municipality consists of the three main village areas: Hjartdalsbygda, Sauland, and Tuddal.

==Government==
Hjartdal Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Telemark District Court and the Agder Court of Appeal.

==General information==

The parish of &quot;Hvideseid&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The spelling of the name was later changed to &quot;Kviteseid&quot;. On 11 October 1873, an unpopulated area of Kviteseid was transferred to Seljord Municipality. The boundaries have not changed since that time.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Kviteseid&quot; farm () since the Old Kviteseid Church was built there. The first element comes from the old name for the lake Kviteseidvatnet. That name is the plural genitive case of the word which means &quot;white&quot; or &quot;the white one&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;isthmus&quot; or &quot;path between two lakes&quot;. Prior to 1889, the name was spelled &quot;Hviteseid&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 27 November 1987. The official blazon is &quot;Or, a lock plate sable&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The charge is a black lock plate. The lock design is based on one from the &quot;Tveitloftet&quot; medieval storehouse on the local Tveit farm dating back to the year 1350. The design symbolises the long traditions of lock-making and building construction in the area. The arms were designed by Daniel Rike. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.
