<text>Ernest Wiseman (27 November 1925 – 21 March 1999), known by his stage name Ernie Wise, was an English comedian, best known as one half of the comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, who became a national institution on British television, especially for their Christmas specials.

==Early life and education==
Ernest Wiseman, born in Leeds to Harry and Connie (&quot;née&quot; Wright) Wiseman, who married in St Thomas, Stanningley, was the eldest of five children, and changed his surname (as did his future partner) to go into show business. He attended Thorpe Infant and Junior School, and then East Ardsley Boys&#x27; School, but entered the entertainment industry in 1933, appearing as an actor and singer in music hall. His father, Harry, a railway lamp man, was also a semi-professional singer, and they appeared together under the name &quot;Bert Carson and his Little Wonder&quot;. An early clipping shows Bert Carson and the Little Wonder (then aged seven) taking part in an audition concert at the Harewood Working Men&#x27;s Club in January 1933.

Wise (aged 10) appeared as a clown in the Nignog Revue at the Alhambra in Bradford in March 1936 and received a very good review. “His tap dancing and personality songs are in the best music hall style, and he astonished the house with his amazing boldness.” He started making solo appearances—singing, dancing, and telling jokes—in 1936, and in the autumn of 1938 he came to the attention of Bryan Michie, a leading juvenile talent spotter, who recommended him to the impresario Jack Hylton. Working with Hylton, Wise made his London debut in January 1939 at the Princes&#x27; Theatre in the &quot;Band Waggon&quot; stage show and received a very good review. He toured with Jack Hylton&#x27;s stage show and made his television debut on the BBC London television Jack Hylton show on 15 March 1939.

==Performing career==

In August 1940, Wise met Eric Morecambe, then known as Eric Bartholomew, when they were both in the touring Jack Hylton show &quot;Youth takes a Bow&quot;.

Gradually, the duo formed a close friendship, and, in 1941, they began their comedy double act, which was to last until Morecambe&#x27;s death in 1984. They made their debut together as &quot;Bartholomew and Wise&quot; on Thursday 28 August 1941, at the Liverpool Empire. A change of name followed in the autumn: after agreeing that the combination of their respective places of birth—Morecambe and Leeds—would make the act sound too much like a cheap day return, they settled on &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot;.

Both continued to work in theatre comedy during the Second World War until late 1943, when Morecambe went down a coal mine at Accrington (as a Bevin Boy) and Wise served in the Merchant Navy.

They reunited after the war and made their name in radio, transferring to television in April 1954—although their first TV series, &quot;Running Wild&quot;, was unsuccessful. In 1961, they gained their own series on ATV, which was a success and raised their profile. They transferred to the BBC in 1968. Over a period of more than twenty years, Morecambe and Wise had regular series with both ITV and BBC. In 1976, they were both appointed OBEs.

Wise was commonly regarded as the straight man of the partnership, although his role gradually and subtly changed over the years. When Eddie Braben took over as their chief writer, he enriched Wise&#x27;s persona by making him pompous and naive. Wise&#x27;s character changed from being a conventional straight man into a pretentious and self-satisfied buffoon. Braben also made Wise a would-be writer; their BBC shows in the 1970s would regularly climax with an extended sketch, introduced by Wise as &quot;a play what I wrote.&quot; It was in such a &#x27;play&#x27; that Glenda Jackson, at the height of her career, was made to speak the line &quot;All men are fools, and what makes them so is having beauty like what I have got.&quot;

==Later years==
On 1 January 1985, he made what was publicised as the first public mobile phone call in the UK, from St Katharine Docks, East London, to Vodafone&#x27;s Headquarters in Newbury, Berkshire. In 2015, it was reported that the actual first call was made a few hours earlier by Michael Harrison to his father, Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman of Vodafone.

Also in 1985, Wise appeared in an acting role in an episode of the American TV situation comedy &quot;Too Close for Comfort&quot;, playing an old friend of the main character Henry, played by Ted Knight. It was Wise&#x27;s only appearance in an American sitcom, and his last acting role on TV although he would continue to make TV appearances for the next decade, they were all on UK-based documentary, panel, or chat shows.

Wise appeared regularly as a panellist on the ITV revival of the popular panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; He was a guest several times on &quot;Countdown&quot;, had a gardening column in the &quot;News of the World&quot; newspaper and also appeared in several West End plays, including &quot;The Mystery Of Edwin Drood&quot; in 1987. He gave talks on cruises about his life and career. In 1989, he made a guest appearance in &quot;Rainbow&quot; Series 17, Episode 1276. He wrote his autobiography, &quot;Still on My Way to Hollywood&quot;, in 1990. He also was the subject on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, which was transmitted on Boxing Day that year. His 1992 Christmas single was a recommended retail release in &quot;Music Week&quot;. Wise was also an active and long-time participant in the Keep Britain Tidy campaign.

On 14 May 1994, the BBC aired the first of three episodes of a mini-series called &quot;Bring Me Sunshine&quot;, as a tribute to Eric Morecambe. It was hosted by Ben Elton, who is a huge fan of Morecambe and Wise, and who cites the duo as a big influence on his career. Those interviewed were John Thaw, Roy Castle (who was to die later that year), Diana Rigg, Hale and Pace, and Fry and Laurie. Wise was not asked to participate, the BBC saying that they did not want &quot;too many talking heads&quot;. He was, however, recovering from a minor stroke which he had suffered in December 1993 which forced him to spend Christmas and New Year in hospital.

Wise suffered a second minor stroke in August 1995, and as a result, announced his retirement from show business on 27 November 1995, his 70th birthday. In August 1998, Wise was asked by the BBC to take part in &quot;Bring Me Sunshine: The Heart and Soul of Eric Morecambe&quot;, which was shown on 23 December that year. He had agreed to do so, but then his health had begun to deteriorate further. Earlier that month, Wise suffered two heart attacks within a week while on holiday, and had to undergo a triple heart bypass in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on 22 January 1999. In March 1999, he was flown back to RAF Northolt, in London, by air ambulance and taken directly to the Nuffield Hospital at Wexham, Buckinghamshire.

Wise died from heart failure and a chest infection at the Nuffield Hospital, Wexham, near Slough, on the morning of 21 March 1999. He was 73 years old. His funeral was on 30 March at Slough Crematorium.

==Marriage==
Wise married to dancer Doreen Blythe (14 May 1930 – 14 April 2018) on 18 January 1953. They had no children, and remained married until his death.

==Legacy and statue==

In March 2010, Wise&#x27;s widow Doreen unveiled a statue of him in his home town of Morley, West Yorkshire, where he won a talent contest in 1936. The statue was commissioned by the Morley Murals Committee and funded by Doreen.

<text>Personality is any person&#x27;s collection of interrelated behavioral, cognitive, and emotional patterns that comprise a person’s unique adjustment to life. These interrelated patterns are relatively stable, but can change over long time periods, driven by experiences and maturational processes, especially the adoption of social roles as worker or parent. Personality differences are the strongest predictors of virtually all key life outcomes, from academic and work and relationship success and satisfaction to mental and somatic health and well-being and longevity.

Although there is no consensus definition of personality, most theories focus on motivation and psychological interactions with one&#x27;s environment. Trait-based personality theories, such as those defined by Raymond Cattell, define personality as traits that predict an individual&#x27;s behavior. On the other hand, more behaviorally-based approaches define personality through learning and habits. Nevertheless, most theories view personality as relatively stable.

The study of the psychology of personality, called personality psychology, attempts to explain the tendencies that underlie differences in behavior. Psychologists have taken many different approaches to the study of personality, which can be organized across dispositional, biological, intrapsychic (psychodynamic), cognitive-experiential, social and cultural, and adjustment domains. The various approaches used to study personality today reflect the influence of the first theorists in the field, a group that includes Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Gordon Allport, Hans Eysenck, Abraham Maslow, and Carl Rogers.

==Measuring==
Personality can be determined through a variety of tests. Due to the fact that personality is a complex idea, the dimensions of personality and scales of such tests vary and often are poorly defined. Two main tools to measure personality are objective tests and projective measures. Examples of such tests are the: Big Five Inventory (BFI), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2), Rorschach Inkblot test, Neurotic Personality Questionnaire KON-2006, or Eysenck&#x27;s Personality Questionnaire (EPQ-R). All of these tests are beneficial because they have both reliability and validity, two factors that make a test accurate. &quot;Each item should be influenced to a degree by the underlying trait construct, giving rise to a pattern of positive intercorrelations so long as all items are oriented (worded) in the same direction.&quot; A recent, but not well-known, measuring tool that psychologists use is the 16PF. It measures personality based on Cattell&#x27;s 16-factor theory of personality. Psychologists also use it as a clinical measuring tool to diagnose psychiatric disorders and help with prognosis and therapy planning. 

Personality is frequently broken into factors or dimensions, statistically extracted from large questionnaires through factor analysis. When brought back to two dimensions, often the dimensions of introvert-extrovert and neuroticism (emotionally unstable-stable) are used as first proposed by Eysenck in the 1960s.

===Big Five Personality Traits===

THE APPROACH with most support in the field is called the Big Five, which are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or emotional stability), often memorized as &quot;ocean&quot;. These components are generally stable over time, and about half of the variance appears to be attributable to a person&#x27;s genetics rather than the effects of one&#x27;s environment. These five factors are made up of two aspects each as well as many facets (e.g., openness splits into experiencing and intellect, which each further split into facets like fantasy and ideas). These five factors also show correlations with each other that suggest higher order meta-traits (e.g., factor beta, which combines openness and extraversion to form a meta-trait associated with mental and physical exploration). There are several personality frameworks that recognize the Big Five factors and there are thousands of measures of personality that can be used to measure specific facets as well as general traits.

Some research has investigated whether the relationship between happiness and extraversion seen in adults also can be seen in children. The implications of these findings can help identify children who are more likely to experience episodes of depression and develop types of treatment that such children are likely to respond to. In both children and adults, research shows that genetics, as opposed to environmental factors, exert a greater influence on happiness levels. Personality is not stable over the course of a lifetime, but it changes much more quickly during childhood, so personality constructs in children are referred to as temperament. Temperament is regarded as the precursor to personality.

Another interesting finding has been the link found between acting extraverted and positive affect. Extraverted behaviors include acting talkative, assertive, adventurous, and outgoing. For the purposes of this study, positive affect is defined as experiences of happy and enjoyable emotions. This study investigated the effects of acting in a way that is counter to a person&#x27;s dispositional nature. In other words, the study focused on the benefits and drawbacks of introverts (people who are shy, socially inhibited, and non-aggressive) acting extraverted, and of extraverts acting introverted. After acting extraverted, introverts&#x27; experience of positive affect increased whereas extraverts seemed to experience lower levels of positive affect and suffered from the phenomenon of ego depletion. Ego depletion, or cognitive fatigue, is the use of one&#x27;s energy to overtly act in a way that is contrary to one&#x27;s inner disposition. When people act in a contrary fashion, they divert most, if not all, (cognitive) energy toward regulating this foreign style of behavior and attitudes. Because all available energy is being used to maintain this contrary behavior, the result is an inability to use any energy to make important or difficult decisions, plan for the future, control or regulate emotions, or perform effectively on other cognitive tasks.

One question that has been posed is why extraverts tend to be happier than introverts. The two types of explanations that attempt to account for this difference are instrumental theories and temperamental theories. The instrumental theory suggests that extraverts end up making choices that place them in more positive situations and they also react more strongly than introverts to positive situations. The temperamental theory suggests that extroverts have a disposition that generally leads them to experience a higher degree of positive affect. In their study of extraversion, Lucas and Baird found no statistically significant support for the instrumental theory but did, however, find that extraverts generally experience a higher level of positive affect.

Research has been done to uncover some of the mediators that are responsible for the correlation between extraversion and happiness. &quot;Self-esteem&quot; and &quot;self-efficacy&quot; are two such mediators.

Self-efficacy is one&#x27;s belief about abilities to perform up to personal standards, the ability to produce desired results, and the feeling of having some ability to make important life decisions. Self-efficacy has been found to be related to the personality traits of extraversion and subjective well-being.

Self-efficacy, however, only partially mediates the relationship between extraversion (and neuroticism) and subjective happiness. This implies that there are most likely other factors that mediate the relationship between subjective happiness and personality traits. &quot;Self-esteem&quot; maybe another similar factor. Individuals with a greater degree of confidence about themselves and their abilities seem to have both higher degrees of subjective well-being and higher levels of extraversion.

Other research has examined the phenomenon of &quot;mood maintenance&quot; as another possible mediator. &quot;Mood maintenance&quot; is the ability to maintain one&#x27;s average level of happiness in the face of an ambiguous situation – meaning a situation that has the potential to engender either positive or negative emotions in different individuals. It has been found to be a stronger force in extroverts. This means that the happiness levels of extraverted individuals are less susceptible to the influence of external events. This finding implies that extraverts&#x27; positive moods last longer than those of introverts.

==Developmental biological model==
Modern conceptions of personality, such as the Temperament and Character Inventory have suggested four basic temperaments that are thought to reflect basic and automatic responses to danger and reward that rely on associative learning. The four temperaments, &quot;harm avoidance&quot;, &quot;reward dependence&quot;, &quot;novelty-seeking&quot; and &quot;persistence&quot;, are somewhat analogous to ancient conceptions of melancholic, sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic personality types, although the temperaments reflect dimensions rather than distance categories.

The harm avoidance trait has been associated with increased reactivity in insular and amygdala salience networks, as well as reduced 5-HT2 receptor binding peripherally, and reduced GABA concentrations. Novelty seeking has been associated with reduced activity in insular salience networks increased striatal connectivity. Novelty seeking correlates with dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum and reduced auto receptor availability in the midbrain. Reward dependence has been linked with the oxytocin system, with increased concentration of plasma oxytocin being observed, as well as increased volume in oxytocin-related regions of the hypothalamus. Persistence has been associated with increased striatal-mPFC connectivity, increased activation of ventral striatal-orbitofrontal-anterior cingulate circuits, as well as increased salivary amylase levels indicative of increased noradrenergic tone.

== Environmental influences ==
It has been shown that personality traits are more malleable by environmental influences than researchers originally believed. Personality differences predict the occurrence of life experiences.

One study has shown how the home environment, specifically the types of parents a person has, can affect and shape their personality. Mary Ainsworth&#x27;s strange situation experiment showcased how babies reacted to having their mother leave them alone in a room with a stranger. The different styles of attachment, labeled by Ainsworth, were Secure, Ambivalent, avoidant, and disorganized. Children who were securely attached tend to be more trusting, sociable, and are confident in their day-to-day life. Children who were disorganized were reported to have higher levels of anxiety, anger, and risk-taking behavior.

Judith Rich Harris&#x27;s group socialization theory postulates that an individual&#x27;s peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Intra- and intergroup processes, not dyadic relationships such as parent-child relationships, are responsible for the transmission of culture and for environmental modification of children&#x27;s personality characteristics. Thus, this theory points at the peer group representing the environmental influence on a child&#x27;s personality rather than the parental style or home environment.

Tessuya Kawamoto&#x27;s &quot;Personality Change from Life Experiences: Moderation Effect of Attachment Security&quot; talked about some significant laboratory tests. The study mainly focused on the effects of life experiences on change in personality and life experiences. The assessments suggested that &quot;the accumulation of small daily experiences may work for the personality development of university students and that environmental influences may vary by individual susceptibility to experiences, like attachment security&quot;.

Some studies suggest that a shared family environment between siblings has less influence on personality than individual experiences of each child. Identical twins have similar personalities largely because they share the same genetic makeup rather than their shared environment.

==Cross-cultural studies==
Personality can be distinguished from more dispositional temperaments as reflecting adjustment to the culture in which one lives and grows, such as what to be ashamed or proud about, and cultural values. Many personality characteristics are human universals but other elements have proven to be unique to specific cultures and &quot;the Big Five&quot; have shown clear cross-cultural applicability.

Cross-cultural assessment depends on the universality of personality traits, which is whether there are common traits among humans regardless of culture or other factors. If there is a common foundation of personality, then it can be studied on the basis of human traits rather than within certain cultures. This can be measured by comparing whether assessment tools are measuring similar constructs across countries or cultures. Two approaches to researching personality are looking at emic and etic traits. Emic traits are constructs unique to each culture, which are determined by local customs, thoughts, beliefs, and characteristics. Etic traits are considered universal constructs, which establish traits that are evident across cultures that represent a biological basis of human personality. If personality traits are unique to the individual culture, then different traits should be apparent in different cultures. However, the idea that personality traits are universal across cultures is supported by establishing the Five-Factor Model of personality across multiple translations of the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used personality measures. When administering the NEO-PI-R to 7,134 people across six languages, the results show a similar pattern of the same five underlying constructs that are found in the American factor structure.

Similar results were found using the Big Five Inventory (BFI), as it was administered in 56 nations across 28 languages. The five factors continued to be supported both conceptually and statistically across major regions of the world, suggesting that these underlying factors are common across cultures. There are some differences across culture, but they may be a consequence of using a lexical approach to study personality structures, as language has limitations in translation and different cultures have unique words to describe emotion or situations. Differences across cultures could be due to real cultural differences, but they could also be consequences of poor translations, biased sampling, or differences in response styles across cultures. Examining personality questionnaires developed within a culture can also be useful evidence for the universality of traits across cultures, as the same underlying factors can still be found. Results from several European and Asian studies have found overlapping dimensions with the Five-Factor Model as well as additional culture-unique dimensions. Finding similar factors across cultures provides support for the universality of personality trait structure, but more research is necessary to gain stronger support.

Culture is an important factor in shaping the personality of individuals. Psychologists have found that cultural norms, beliefs, and practices shape the way people interact and behave with others, which can impact personality development (Cheung et al., 2011).

Studies have identified cultural differences in personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, indicating that culture influences personality development (Allik &amp; McCrae, 2004). For example, Western cultures value individualism, independence, and assertiveness, which are reflected in personality traits such as extraversion. In contrast, Eastern cultures value collectivism, cooperation, and social harmony, which are reflected in personality traits such as agreeableness (Cheung et al., 2011).

==Historical development of concept==
The modern sense of individual personality is a result of the shifts in culture originating in the Renaissance, an essential element in modernity. In contrast, the Medieval European&#x27;s sense of self was linked to a network of social roles: &quot;the household, the Kinship network, the guild, the corporation – these were the building blocks of personhood&quot;. Stephen Greenblatt observes, in recounting the recovery (1417) and career of Lucretius&#x27; poem &quot;De rerum natura&quot;: &quot;at the core of the poem lay key principles of a modern understanding of the world.&quot; &quot;Dependent on the family, the individual alone was nothing,&quot; Jacques Gélis observes. &quot;The characteristic mark of the modern man has two parts: one internal, the other external; one dealing with his environment, the other with his attitudes, values, and feelings.&quot; Rather than being linked to a network of social roles, the modern man is largely influenced by the environmental factors such as: &quot;urbanization, education, mass communication, industrialization, and politicization.&quot;

==Temperament and philosophy==

William James (1842–1910) argued that temperament explains a great deal of the controversies in the history of philosophy by arguing that it is a very influential premise in the arguments of philosophers. Despite seeking only impersonal reasons for their conclusions, James argued, the temperament of philosophers influenced their philosophy. Temperament thus conceived is tantamount to a bias. Such bias, James explained, was a consequence of the trust philosophers place in their own temperament. James thought the significance of his observation lay on the premise that in philosophy an objective measure of success is whether philosophy is peculiar to its philosopher or not, and whether a philosopher is dissatisfied with any other way of seeing things or not.

=== Mental make-up ===
James argued that temperament may be the basis of several divisions in academia, but focused on philosophy in his 1907 lectures on &quot;Pragmatism&quot;. In fact, James&#x27; lecture of 1907 fashioned a sort of trait theory of the empiricist and rationalist camps of philosophy. As in most modern trait theories, the traits of each camp are described by James as distinct and opposite, and maybe possessed in different proportions on a continuum, and thus characterize the personality of philosophers of each camp. The &quot;mental make-up&quot; (i.e. personality) of rationalist philosophers is described as &quot;tender-minded&quot; and &quot;going by &quot;principles&quot;, and that of empiricist philosophers is described as &quot;tough-minded&quot; and &quot;going by &quot;facts.&quot; James distinguishes each not only in terms of the philosophical claims they made in 1907, but by arguing that such claims are made primarily on the basis of temperament. Furthermore, such categorization was only incidental to James&#x27; purpose of explaining his pragmatist philosophy and is not exhaustive.

===Empiricists and rationalists===

According to James, the &quot;temperament&quot; of rationalist philosophers differed fundamentally from the &quot;temperament&quot; of empiricist philosophers of his day. The tendency of rationalist philosophers toward &quot;refinement&quot; and &quot;superficiality&quot; never satisfied an empiricist temper of mind. Rationalism leads to the creation of &quot;closed systems&quot;, and such optimism is considered shallow by the fact-loving mind, for whom perfection is far off. Rationalism is regarded as &quot;pretension&quot;, and a temperament most inclined to &quot;abstraction&quot;.

Empiricists, on the other hand, stick with the external senses rather than logic. British empiricist John Locke&#x27;s (1632–1704) explanation of personal identity provides an example of what James referred to. Locke explains the identity of a person, i.e. personality, on the basis of a precise definition of identity, by which the meaning of identity differs according to what it is being applied to. The identity of a person is quite distinct from the identity of a man, woman, or substance according to Locke. Locke concludes that consciousness is personality because it &quot;always accompanies thinking, it is that which makes everyone to be what he calls self,&quot; and remains constant in different places at different times.

Rationalists conceived of the identity of persons differently than empiricists such as Locke who distinguished identity of substance, person, and life. According to Locke, René Descartes (1596–1650) agreed only insofar as he did not argue that one immaterial spirit is the basis of the person &quot;for fear of making brutes thinking things too.&quot; According to James, Locke tolerated arguments that a soul was behind the consciousness of any person. However, Locke&#x27;s successor David Hume (1711–1776), and empirical psychologists after him denied the soul except for being a term to describe the cohesion of inner lives. However, some research suggests Hume excluded personal identity from his opus &quot;An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot; because he thought his argument was sufficient but not compelling. Descartes himself distinguished active and passive faculties of mind, each contributing to thinking and consciousness in different ways. The passive faculty, Descartes argued, simply receives, whereas the active faculty produces and forms ideas, but does not presuppose thought, and thus cannot be within the thinking thing. The active faculty mustn&#x27;t be within self because ideas are produced without any awareness of them, and are sometimes produced against one&#x27;s will.

Rationalist philosopher Benedictus Spinoza (1632–1677) argued that ideas are the first element constituting the human mind, but existed only for actually existing things. In other words, ideas of non-existent things are without meaning for Spinoza, because an idea of a non-existent thing cannot exist. Further, Spinoza&#x27;s rationalism argued that the mind does not know itself, except insofar as it perceives the &quot;ideas of the modifications of body&quot;, in describing its external perceptions, or perceptions from without. On the contrary, from within, Spinoza argued, perceptions connect various ideas clearly and distinctly. The mind is not the free cause of its actions for Spinoza. Spinoza equates the will with the understanding and explains the common distinction of these things as being two different things as an error which results from the individual&#x27;s misunderstanding of the nature of thinking.

==Biology==
The biological basis of personality is the theory that anatomical structures such as genes, hormones, or brain areas underlie individual differences in personality. This stems from neuropsychology, which studies how the structure of the brain relates to various psychological processes and behaviors. For instance, in human beings, the frontal lobes are responsible for foresight and anticipation, and the occipital lobes are responsible for processing visual information. In addition, certain physiological functions such as hormone secretion also affect personality. For example, the hormone testosterone is important for sociability, affectivity, aggressiveness, and sexuality. Additionally, studies show that the expression of a personality trait depends on the volume of the brain cortex it is associated with.

== Personology ==
Personology confers a multidimensional, complex, and comprehensive approach to personality. According to Henry A. Murray, personology is: 

From a holistic perspective, personology studies personality as a whole, as a system, but at the same time through all its components, levels, and spheres.

<text>The Asiatic-Pacific Theater was the theater of operations of U.S. forces during World War II in the Pacific War during 1941–1945. From mid-1942 until the end of the war in 1945, two U.S. operational commands were in the Pacific. The Pacific Ocean Areas (POA), divided into the Central Pacific Area, the North Pacific Area and the South Pacific Area, were commanded by Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas. The South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was commanded by General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific Area. During 1945, the United States added the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, commanded by General Carl A. Spaatz.

Because of the complementary roles of the United States Army and the United States Navy in conducting war, the Pacific Theater had no single Allied or U.S. commander (comparable to General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower in the European Theater of Operations). No actual command existed; rather, the Asiatic-Pacific Theater was divided into SWPA, POA, and other forces and theaters, such as the China Burma India Theater.

<text>Hans Jürgen Eysenck ( ; 4 March 1916 – 4 September 1997) was a German-born British psychologist. He is best remembered for his work on intelligence and personality, although he worked on other issues in psychology. At the time of his death, Eysenck was the most frequently cited living psychologist in peer-reviewed scientific journal literature.

Eysenck&#x27;s research purported to show that certain personality types had an elevated risk of cancer and heart disease. Scholars have identified errors and suspected data manipulation in Eysenck&#x27;s work, and large replications have failed to confirm the relationships that he purported to find. An enquiry on behalf of King&#x27;s College London found the papers by Eysenck coauthored with Ronald Grossarth-Maticek to be &quot;incompatible with modern clinical science&quot;, with 26 of the joint papers considered &quot;unsafe&quot;. Fourteen papers were retracted in 2020, and over 60 statements of concern were issued by scientific journals in 2020 about publications by Eysenck. David Marks and Rod Buchanan, a biographer of Eysenck, have argued that 87 publications by Eysenck should be retracted.

During his life, Eysenck&#x27;s claims about IQ scores and race, first published in 1971, were a significant source of controversy. Eysenck claimed that IQ scores were influenced by genetic differences between racial groups. Eysenck&#x27;s beliefs on race have been discredited by subsequent research, and are no longer accepted as part of mainstream science.

==Life==
Eysenck was born in Berlin, Germany. His mother was Silesian-born film star Helga Molander, and his father, Eduard Anton Eysenck, was an actor and nightclub entertainer who was once voted &quot;handsomest man on the Baltic coast&quot;. His mother was Lutheran and his father was Catholic. Eysenck was brought up by his maternal grandmother who was a Jewish convert to Catholicism. Subjected to the Nuremberg laws, she was deported and died in a concentration camp.
An initial move to England in the 1930s became permanent because of his opposition to the Nazi party and its persecutions. &quot;My hatred of Hitler and the Nazis, and all they stood for, was so overwhelming that no argument could counter it.&quot; Because of his German citizenship, he was initially unable to gain employment, and he came close to being interned during the war. He received his PhD in 1940 from University College London (UCL) working in the Department of Psychology under the supervision of Professor Sir Cyril Burt, with whom he had a tumultuous professional relationship throughout his working life.

Eysenck was Professor of Psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, King&#x27;s College London, from 1955 to 1983. He was a major contributor to the modern scientific theory of personality and helped find treatment for mental illnesses. Eysenck also created and developed a distinctive dimensional model of personality structure based on empirical factor-analytic research, attempting to anchor these factors in biogenetic variation. In 1981, Eysenck became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. He was the founding editor of the international journal &quot;Personality and Individual Differences&quot;, and wrote about 80 books and more than 1,600 journal articles. With his first wife, Hans Eysenck had a son Michael Eysenck, who is also a psychology professor. He had four children with his second wife, Sybil Eysenck: Gary, Connie, Kevin, and Darrin. Hans and Sybil Eysenck collaborated as psychologists for many years at the Institute of Psychiatry, University of London, as co-authors and researchers. Sybil Eysenck died in December 2020, and Hans Eysenck died of a brain tumour in a London hospice in 1997. He was an atheist.

The Eysencks&#x27; home was at 10 Dorchester Drive, Herne Hill, London from 1960 until their respective deaths.

==Views and their reception ==

Examples of publications in which Eysenck&#x27;s views roused controversy include (chronologically):
* A paper in the 1950s concluding that available data &quot;fail to support the hypothesis that psychotherapy facilitates recovery from neurotic disorder&quot;.
* A chapter in &quot;Uses and Abuses of Psychology&quot; (1953) entitled &quot;What is wrong with psychoanalysis&quot;.
* &quot;The Psychology of Politics&quot; (1954)
* &quot;Race, Intelligence and Education&quot; (1971) (in the US: &quot;The IQ Argument&quot;).
* &quot;Sex, Violence and the Media&quot; (1978).
* &quot;Astrology — Science or Superstition?&quot; (1982).
* &quot;Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire&quot; (1985). 
* &quot;Smoking, Personality and Stress&quot; (1991).

Eysenck&#x27;s attitude was summarised in his autobiography &quot;Rebel with a Cause&quot;: &quot;I always felt that a scientist owes the world only one thing, and that is the truth as he sees it. If the truth contradicts deeply held beliefs, that is too bad. Tact and diplomacy are fine in international relations, in politics, perhaps even in business; in science only one thing matters, and that is the facts.&quot; He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.

===&quot;The Psychology of Politics&quot;===
In this book, Eysenck suggests that political behavior may be analysed in terms of two independent dimensions: the traditional left-right distinction, and how &#x27;tenderminded&#x27; or &#x27;toughminded&#x27; a person is. Eysenck suggests that the latter is a result of a person&#x27;s introversion or extraversion respectively.

Colleagues critiqued the research that formed the basis of this book, on a number of grounds, including the following:
* Eysenck claims that his findings can be applied to the British middle class as a whole, but the people in his sample were far younger and better educated than the British middle class as a whole.
* Supporters of different parties were recruited in different ways: Communists were recruited through party branches, fascists in an unspecified manner, and supporters of other parties by giving copies of the questionnaire to his students and telling them to apply it to friends and acquaintances.
* Scores were obtained by applying the same weight to groups of different sizes. For example, the responses of 250 middle-class supporters of the Liberal Party were given the same weight as those of 27 working-class Liberals.
* Scores were rounded without explanation, in directions that supported Eysenck&#x27;s theories.

===Genetics, race and intelligence===

Eysenck advocated a strong influence from genetics and race on IQ differences. Eysenck supported Arthur Jensen&#x27;s questioning of whether variation in IQ between racial groups was entirely environmental. In opposition to this position, Eysenck was punched in the face by a protester during a talk at the London School of Economics. Eysenck also received bomb threats and threats to kill his young children.

Eysenck claimed that the media had given people the misleading impression that his views were outside the mainstream scientific consensus. Eysenck cited &quot;The IQ Controversy, the Media and Public Policy&quot; as showing that there was majority support for all of the main contentions he had put forward, and further claimed that there was no real debate about the matter among relevant scientists.

Regarding this controversy, in 1988 S. A. Barnett described Eysenck as a &quot;prolific popularizer&quot; and he exemplified Eysenck&#x27;s writings on this topic with two passages from his early 1970s books:


Barnett quotes additional criticism of &quot;Race, Intelligence and Education&quot; from Sandra Scarr, who wrote in 1976 that Eysenck&#x27;s book was &quot;generally inflammatory&quot; and that there &quot;is something in this book to insult almost everyone except WASPs and Jews.&quot; Scarr was equally critical of Eysenck&#x27;s hypotheses, one of which was the supposition that slavery on plantations had selected African Americans as a less intelligent sub-sample of Africans. Scarr also criticised another statement of Eysenck on the alleged significantly lower IQs of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek immigrants in the US relative to the populations in their country of origin. &quot;Although Eysenck is careful to say that these are not established facts (because no IQ tests were given to the immigrants or nonimmigrants in question?&quot;) Scarr writes that the careful reader would conclude that &quot;Eysenck admits that scientific evidence to date does not permit a clear choice of the genetic-differences interpretation of black inferiority on intelligence tests,&quot; whereas a &quot;quick reading of the book, however, is sure to leave the reader believing that scientific evidence today strongly supports the conclusion that US blacks are genetically inferior to whites in IQ.&quot;

Some of Eysenck&#x27;s later work was funded by the Pioneer Fund, an organization which promoted scientific racism.

===Cancer-prone personality===
Eysenck also received funding for consultation research via the New York legal firm Jacob &amp; Medinger, which was acting on behalf of the tobacco industry. In a talk given in 1994 he mentioned that he asked Reynolds for funding to continue research. Asked what he felt about tobacco industry lawyers being involved in selecting scientists for research projects, he said that research should be judged on its quality, not on who paid for it, adding that he had not personally profited from the funds. According to &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, Eysenck received more than £800,000 in this way. Eysenck conducted many studies making claims about the role of personality in cigarette smoking and disease, but he also said &quot;I have no doubt, smoking is not a healthy habit.&quot;

His article &quot;Cancer, personality and stress: Prediction and prevention&quot; defines Cancer-prone (Type C) personality. The science behind this claim has now come under public scrutiny in the 2019 King&#x27;s College London enquiry (see below).

===Genetics of personality===

In 1951, Eysenck&#x27;s first empirical study into the genetics of personality was published. It was an investigation carried out with his student and associate Donald Prell, from 1948 to 1951, in which identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins, ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism. It is described in detail in an article published in the &quot;Journal of Mental Science&quot;. Eysenck and Prell concluded: &quot;The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole...neurotic predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined.&quot;

=== Model of personality===
The two personality dimensions extraversion and neuroticism were described in his 1947 book &quot;Dimensions of Personality&quot;. It is common practice in personality psychology to refer to the dimensions by the first letters, E and N.

E and N provided a two-dimensional space to describe individual differences in behaviour. Eysenck noted how these two dimensions were similar to the four personality types first proposed by the Greek physician Galen. 
* High N and high E = Choleric type
* High N and low E = Melancholic type
* Low N and high E = Sanguine type
* Low N and low E = Phlegmatic type

The third dimension, psychoticism, was added to the model in the late 1970s, based upon collaborations between Eysenck and his wife, Sybil B. G. Eysenck.

Eysenck&#x27;s model attempted to provide detailed theory of the causes of personality. For example, Eysenck proposed that extraversion was caused by variability in cortical arousal: &quot;introverts are characterized by higher levels of activity than extraverts and so are chronically more cortically aroused than extraverts&quot;. Similarly, Eysenck proposed that location within the neuroticism dimension was determined by individual differences in the limbic system. While it seems counterintuitive to suppose that introverts are &quot;more&quot; aroused than extraverts, the putative effect this has on behaviour is such that the introvert seeks lower levels of stimulation. Conversely, the extravert seeks to heighten his or her arousal to a more favourable level (as predicted by the Yerkes-Dodson Law) by increased activity, social engagement and other stimulation-seeking behaviours.

====Comparison with other theories====
Jeffrey Alan Gray, a former student of Eysenck&#x27;s, developed a comprehensive alternative theoretical interpretation (called Gray&#x27;s biopsychological theory of personality) of the biological and psychological data studied by Eysenck – leaning more heavily on animal and learning models. Currently, the most widely used model of personality is the Big Five model. The purported traits in the Big Five model are as follows:
#Conscientiousness
#Agreeableness
#Neuroticism
#Openness to experience
#Extraversion

Extraversion and neuroticism in the Big Five are very similar to Eysenck&#x27;s traits of the same name. However, what he calls the trait of psychoticism corresponds to two traits in the Big Five model: conscientiousness and agreeableness (Goldberg &amp; Rosalack 1994). Eysenck&#x27;s personality system did not address openness to experience. He argued that his approach was a better description of personality.

===Psychometric scales ===
Eysenck&#x27;s theory of personality is closely linked with the psychometric scales that he and his co-workers constructed. These included the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI), the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), as well as the revised version (EPQ-R) and its corresponding short-form (EPQ-R-S). The Eysenck Personality Profiler (EPP) breaks down different facets of each trait considered in the model. There has been some debate about whether these facets should include impulsivity as a facet of extraversion as Eysenck declared in his early work, or of psychoticism, as he declared in his later work.

=== Publication in far right-wing press ===
Eysenck was accused of being a supporter of political causes on the extreme right. Connecting arguments were that Eysenck had articles published in the German newspaper &quot;National-Zeitung&quot;, which called him a contributor, and in &quot;Nation und Europa&quot;, and that he wrote the preface to a book by a far-right French writer named Pierre Krebs, &quot;Das unvergängliche Erbe&quot;, that was published by Krebs&#x27; Thule Seminar. Linguist interpreted the preface to Krebs&#x27; book as having &quot;railed against the equality of people, presenting it as an untenable ideological doctrine.&quot; In the &quot;National Zeitung&quot; Eysenck reproached Sigmund Freud for alleged trickiness and lack of frankness. Other incidents that fuelled Eysenck&#x27;s critics like Michael Billig and Steven Rose include the appearance of Eysenck&#x27;s books on the UK National Front&#x27;s list of recommended readings and an interview with Eysenck published by National Front&#x27;s &quot;Beacon&quot; (1977) and later republished in the US neo-fascist &quot;Steppingstones&quot;; a similar interview had been published a year before by &quot;Neue Anthropologie&quot;, described by Eysenck&#x27;s biographer Roderick Buchanan as a &quot;sister publication to &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;, having similar contributors and sometimes sharing the same articles.&quot; Eysenck also wrote an introduction for Roger Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Race, Intelligence and Bias in Academe&quot;. In this introduction to Pearson&#x27;s book, Eysenck retorts that his critics are &quot;the scattered troops&quot; of the New Left, who have adopted the &quot;psychology of the fascists&quot;. Eysenck&#x27;s book &quot;The Inequality of Man&quot;, translated in French as &quot;L&#x27;Inegalite de l&#x27;homme&quot;, was published by GRECE&#x27;s publishing house, Éditions Corpernic. In 1974, Eysenck became a member of the academic advisory council of &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;, joining those associated with the journal in attempting to reinvent it as a more mainstream academic vehicle. Billig asserts that in the same year Eysenck also became a member of the &quot;comité de patronage&quot; of GRECE&#x27;s &quot;Nouvelle École&quot;.

Remarking on Eysenck&#x27;s alleged right-wing connections, Buchanan writes: &quot;For those looking to thoroughly demonize Eysenck, his links with far right groups revealed his true political sympathies.&quot; According to Buchanan, these harsh critics interpreted Eysenck&#x27;s writings as &quot;overtly racist&quot;. Furthermore, Buchanan writes that Eysenck&#x27;s fiercest critics were convinced that Eysenck was &quot;willfully misrepresenting a dark political agenda&quot;. Buchanan argued that &quot;There appeared to be no hidden agenda to Hans Eysenck. He was too self-absorbed, too preoccupied with his own aspirations as a great scientist to harbor specific political aims.&quot;

As Buchanan commented:

According to Buchanan, Eysenck believed that the quality of his research would &quot;help temper social wrongs and excesses&quot;. Eysenck&#x27;s defence was that he did not shy away from publishing or being interviewed in controversial publications, and that he did not necessarily share their editorial viewpoint. As examples, Buchanan mentions contributions by Eysenck to pornographic magazines &quot;Mayfair&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot;.

Eysenck described his views in the introduction to &quot;Race, Education and Intelligence&quot;:

===Parapsychology and astrology===

Eysenck believed that empirical evidence supported parapsychology and astrology. He was criticised by scientific skeptics for endorsing fringe science. Henry Gordon for example stated that Eysenck&#x27;s viewpoint was &quot;incredibly naive&quot; because many of the parapsychology experiments he cited as evidence contained serious problems and were never replicated. Magician and skeptic James Randi noted that Eysenck had supported fraudulent psychics as genuine and had not mentioned their sleight of hand. According to Randi, he had given &quot;a totally-one sided view of the subject&quot;. In 1983, Eysenck and Carl Sargent published their book &quot;Know Your Own Psi-IQ&quot;, which was designed to test readers&#x27; extrasensory perception abilities. According to Randi, &quot;the authors instead gave users a highly biased procedure that would make experiments meaningless and certainly discourage further investigation by the amateur.&quot;

===Later work===

In 1994, he was one of 52 signatories on &quot;Mainstream Science on Intelligence&quot;, an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, which described the consensus of the signing scholars on issues related to intelligence research following the publication of the book &quot;The Bell Curve&quot;. Eysenck included the entire editorial in his 1998 book &quot;Intelligence: A New Look&quot;.

==Posthumous reevaluation==
Eysenck&#x27;s work has undergone reevaluation since his death.

Psychologist Donald R. Peterson noted in letters written in 1995 and published in 2005 that years earlier he had stopped trusting Eysenck&#x27;s work after he tried to replicate a study done in Eysenck&#x27;s lab and concluded that the results of the original study must have been &quot;either concocted or cooked&quot;.

===2019 King&#x27;s College London enquiry ===

In 2019 the psychiatrist Anthony Pelosi, writing for the &quot;Journal of Health Psychology&quot;, described Eysenck&#x27;s work as unsafe. Pelosi described some of Eysenck&#x27;s work as leading to &quot;one of the worst scientific scandals of all time&quot;, with &quot;what must be the most astonishing series of findings ever published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature&quot; and &quot;effect sizes that have never otherwise been encountered in biomedical research.&quot; Pelosi cited 23 &quot;serious criticisms&quot; of Eysenck&#x27;s work that had been published independently by multiple authors between 1991 and 1997, noting that these had never been investigated &quot;by any appropriate authority&quot; at that time. The reportedly fraudulent papers covered the links between personality and cancer. Grossarth and Eysenck claimed the existence of a &quot;cancer prone personality&quot; were supposed to have a risk of dying of cancer 121 times greater than controls, when exposed to the carcinogen physical factor tobacco smoking. Bosely (2019): The &quot;heart disease-prone personality&quot; exposed to physical risk factors is asserted to have 27 times the risk of dying of heart disease as controls. Pelosi concluded &quot;I honestly believe, having read it so carefully and tried to find alternative interpretations, that this is fraudulent work.&quot;

Pelosi&#x27;s writing prompted additional analysis from other academics and journalists. Citing Pelosi, psychologist David F. Marks wrote an open letter (also published in the &quot;Journal of Health Psychology&quot;) calling for the retraction or correction of 61 additional papers by Eysenck. In 2019, 26 of Eysenck&#x27;s papers (all coauthored with Ronald Grossarth-Maticek) were &quot;considered unsafe&quot; by an enquiry on behalf of King&#x27;s College London. It concluded that these publications describing experimental or observational studies were unsafe. It decided that the editors of the 11 journals in which these studies appeared should be informed of their decision. All of the 26 papers were cited in Marks&#x27; open letter.

The publications under discussion were criticized, among other things, for the reason that Eysenck&#x27;s research work was partly financed by the tobacco industry and he therefore may have had an interest to show an association between personality and cancer (instead of an association of smoking and cancer). Eysenck said in 1990, &quot;Note that I have never stated that cigarette smoking is not causally related to cancer and coronary heart disease; to deny such a relationship would be irresponsible and counter to the evidence. I have merely stated that the available evidence is insufficient to &quot;prove&quot; a causal relationship, and this I believe to be true.&quot; In his statement at the time, Eysenck failed to take into account the highly addictive effect of nicotine, which was only later clearly proven by neurophysiological studies.

Grossarth emphasized that the development of disease is often multicausal, whereby the factors reinforce each other in their effect, and he explicitly speaks of behavioral characteristics that may &quot;change&quot; due to psychological intervention. Grossarth emphasises their changeability through cognitive behavioral therapy in his intervention studies. Noting that Eysenck died many years ago and cannot defend himself, Grossarth-Maticek wrote a rebuttal and announced legal actions.

Following the King&#x27;s College London enquiry the &quot;International Journal of Sport Psychology&quot; retracted a paper that was coauthored by Eysenck in 1990. Later, 13 additional papers were retracted. As of the end of 2020, there had been fourteen retractions and seventy-one expressions of concern on papers from as far back as 1946. Some of these are early papers having nothing to do with health and the King&#x27;s College enquiry &quot;did not specifically name the articles this expression of concern relates to as problematic&quot;.

==Portraits==
There are five portraits of Eysenck in the permanent collection of the National Portrait Gallery, London, including photographs by Anne-Katrin Purkiss and Elliott and Fry.

<doc id="177652" wikidata="Q3566020" url="?curid=177652" title="List of psychological research methods">
<text>A wide range of research methods are used in psychology. These methods vary by the sources from which information is obtained, how that information is sampled, and the types of instruments that are used in data collection. Methods also vary by whether they collect qualitative data, quantitative data or both.

Qualitative psychological research findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. Quantitative psychological research findings result from mathematical modeling and statistical estimation or statistical inference. The two types of research differ in the methods employed, rather than the topics they focus on.

There are three main types of psychological research:

* Correlational research
* Descriptive research
* Experimental research

==Common methods==
Common research designs and data collection methods include:

* Archival research
* Case study uses different research methods (e.g. interview, observation, self-report questionnaire) with a single case or small number of cases.
* Computer simulation (modeling)
* Ethnography 
* Event sampling methodology, also referred to as experience sampling methodology, diary study, or ecological momentary assessment
* Experiment, often with separate treatment and control groups (see scientific control and design of experiments). See Experimental psychology for many details.
* Field experiment
* Focus group
* Interview, can be structured or unstructured.
* Meta-analysis
* Neuroimaging and other psychophysiological methods
* Observational study, can be naturalistic (see natural experiment), participant or controlled.
* Program evaluation
* Quasi-experiment
* Self-report inventory
* Survey, often with a random sample (see survey sampling)
* Twin study

Research designs vary according to the period(s) of time over which data are collected:

* Retrospective cohort study: Participants are chosen, then data are collected about their past experiences.
* Prospective cohort study: Participants are recruited prior to the proposed independent effects being administered or occurring.
* Cross-sectional study: A population is sampled on all proposed measures at one point in time.
* Longitudinal study: Participants are studied at multiple time points. May address the cohort effect and help to indicate causal directions of effects.
* Cross-sequential study: Groups of different ages are studied at multiple time points; combines cross-sectional and longitudinal designs

Research in psychology has been conducted with both animals and human subjects:

* Animal study
* Human subject research

<text>Arthur, Prince of Wales (19/20 September 1486 – 2 April 1502), was the eldest son of King Henry VII of England and Elizabeth of York, and an older brother to the future King Henry VIII. He was Duke of Cornwall from birth, and he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester in 1489. As the heir apparent of his father, Arthur was viewed by contemporaries as the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor. His mother was the daughter of the Yorkist king, Edward IV, and his birth cemented the union between the House of Lancaster and the House of York.

Plans for Arthur&#x27;s marriage began before his third birthday. At the age of eleven, he was formally betrothed to Catherine of Aragon, a daughter of the powerful Catholic Monarchs in Spain, in an effort to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France and Scotland. Arthur was well educated and was in good health for the majority of his life. Soon after his marriage to Catherine in 1501, the couple took up residence at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire, where Arthur died six months later, possibly from the sweating sickness, which Catherine survived. Catherine later firmly stated that the marriage had not been consummated.

One year after Arthur&#x27;s death, Henry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur&#x27;s younger brother Henry, who would ascend to the throne in 1509 as King Henry VIII. The question over whether Arthur and Catherine had consummated their marriage was much later, and in a completely different political context, exploited by Henry VIII and his court. This strategy was employed in order to cast doubt upon the validity of Catherine&#x27;s union with Henry VIII, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.

== Infancy ==

Henry VII became King of England upon defeating Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. In an effort to strengthen the Tudor claim to the throne, Henry decided on naming his firstborn son &quot;Arthur&quot; and having him born in Winchester – where the Legend of King Arthur originated – in order to emphasise the Welsh origin of the Tudors. On this occasion, Camelot was identified as present-day Winchester, and his wife, Elizabeth of York, was sent to Saint Swithun&#x27;s Priory (today Winchester Cathedral Priory) to give birth. Born at Saint Swithun&#x27;s on the night of 19/20 September 1486 at about 1 am, Arthur was Henry and Elizabeth&#x27;s eldest child.

Arthur&#x27;s birth was anticipated by French and Italian humanists eager for the start of a &quot;Virgilian golden age&quot;. Sir Francis Bacon wrote that although the Prince was born one month premature, he was &quot;strong and able&quot;. Young Arthur was viewed as &quot;a living symbol&quot; of not only the union between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, to which his mother belonged as the daughter of Edward IV, but also of the end of the Wars of the Roses. In the opinion of contemporaries, Arthur was the great hope of the newly established House of Tudor.

Arthur became Duke of Cornwall at birth. Four days after his birth, he was baptised at Winchester Cathedral by the Bishop of Worcester, John Alcock, which was immediately followed by his confirmation. His godparents were John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford; Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby; William FitzAlan, 16th Earl of Arundel; Arthur&#x27;s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth Woodville; and his aunt Cecily of York. Elizabeth and Cecily carried the prince during the ceremony. Initially, Arthur&#x27;s nursery in Farnham was headed by Elizabeth Darcy, who had served as chief nurse for Edward IV&#x27;s children, including Arthur&#x27;s own mother. After Arthur was created Prince of Wales in 1489, he was awarded a household structure at the behest of his father. Over the next thirteen years, his parents would have six more children, of whom only threeMargaret, Henry and Marywould reach adulthood. Arthur was especially close to his sister Margaret (b. 1489) and his brother Henry (b. 1491), with whom he shared a nursery.

On 29 November 1489, after being made a Knight of the Bath, Arthur was appointed Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, and was invested as such at the Palace of Westminster on 27 February 1490. As part of his investiture ceremony, he progressed down the River Thames in the royal barge and was met at Chelsea by the Lord Mayor of London, John Mathewe, and at Lambeth by Spanish ambassadors. On 8 May 1491, he was made a Knight of the Garter at Saint George&#x27;s Chapel at Windsor Palace. 

Around 1491, Arthur began his formal education under John Rede, a former headmaster of Winchester College. His education was subsequently taken over by Bernard André, a blind French poet and Augustinian friar, and then by Thomas Linacre, formerly Henry VII&#x27;s physician. Arthur&#x27;s education covered grammar, poetry, rhetoric and ethics and focused on history.

Arthur was a very skilled pupil and André wrote that the Prince of Wales had either memorised or read a selection of Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Terence, a good deal of Cicero and a wide span of historical works, including those of Thucydides, Caesar, Livy and Tacitus. Arthur was also a &quot;superb archer&quot;, and had learned to dance &quot;right pleasant and honourably&quot; by 1501.

== Childhood ==
The popular belief that Arthur was sickly during his lifetime stems from a misunderstanding of a 1502 letter, but there are no reports of Arthur being ill during his lifetime. He grew up to be unusually tall for his age, and was considered handsome by the Spanish court: he had reddish hair, small eyes, and a high-bridged nose, resembling his brother Henry, who was said to be &quot;extremely handsome&quot; by contemporaries. As described by historians Steven Gunn and Linda Monckton, Arthur had an &quot;amiable and gentle&quot; personality and was, overall, a &quot;delicate lad&quot;.

In May 1490, Arthur was created warden of all the marches towards Scotland and the Earl of Surrey was appointed as the Prince&#x27;s . From 1491, Arthur was named on peace commissions. In October 1492, when his father travelled to France, he was named Keeper of England and King&#x27;s Lieutenant. Following the example of Edward IV, Henry VII set up the Council of Wales and the Marches for Arthur in Wales, in order to enforce royal authority there. Although the council had already been set up in 1490, it was headed by Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford. By 1493, Arthur had been sent with his household to Ludlow Castle, near Wales. In March 1493, Arthur was granted the power to appoint justices of oyer and terminer and inquire into , thus strengthening the council&#x27;s authority. In November of that year, the Prince also received an extensive land grant in Wales, including the County of March.

Arthur was served by sons of English, Irish and Welsh nobility, such as Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, who had been brought to the English court as a consequence of the involvement of his father, Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, in the crowning of pretender Lambert Simnel in Ireland during Henry VII&#x27;s reign. Other servants were Anthony Willoughby, a son of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, Robert Radcliffe, the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John, a favourite nephew of Arthur&#x27;s grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort. He was brought up with Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas, the son of powerful Welsh nobleman Rhys ap Thomas. Gruffydd grew quite close to Arthur and was buried in Worcester Cathedral upon his death in 1521, alongside the Prince&#x27;s tomb.

== Marriage ==
Henry VII planned to marry Arthur to a daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, in order to forge an Anglo-Spanish alliance against France. It was suggested that the choice of marrying Arthur to Ferdinand and Isabella&#x27;s youngest daughter, Catherine (b. 1485), would be appropriate. Thanks to negotiations by the Spanish ambassador Rodrigo González de la Puebla, the Treaty of Medina del Campo (27 March 1489) provided that Arthur and Catherine would be married as soon as they reached canonical age; it also settled Catherine&#x27;s dowry at 200,000 crowns (the equivalent of £5 million in 2007). Since Arthur, not yet 14, was below the age of consent, a papal dispensation (i.e., waiver) allowing the marriage was issued in February 1497, and the pair were betrothed by proxy on 25 August 1497.

To demonstrate his status as heir to the throne, Arthur made a Royal Entry to Coventry in October 1498. He was welcomed with pageants of the Nine Worthies, introduced by King Arthur, by Queen Fortune, and by Saint George defending a maiden from the dragon. In 1499, a marriage by proxy took place at Arthur&#x27;s Tickenhill Manor in Bewdley, near Worcester; Arthur said to Roderigo de Puebla, who acted as proxy for Catherine, that &quot;he much rejoiced to contract the marriage because of his deep and sincere love for the Princess&quot;. In October 1499, Arthur, referring to Catherine as &quot;my dearest spouse&quot;, wrote: &quot;I cannot tell you what an earnest desire I feel to see your Highness, and how vexatious to me is this procrastination about your coming. Let be hastened, the love conceived between us and the wished-for joys may reap their proper fruit.&quot;

The young couple exchanged letters in Latin until 20 September 1501, when Arthur, having attained the age of 15, was deemed old enough to be married. Catherine landed in England about two weeks later, on 2 October 1501, at Plymouth. The next month, on 4 November 1501, the couple met for the first time at Dogmersfield in Hampshire. Arthur wrote to Catherine&#x27;s parents that he would be &quot;a true and loving husband&quot;; the couple soon discovered that they had mastered different pronunciations of Latin and so were unable to easily communicate. Five days later, on 9 November 1501, Catherine arrived in London.

On 14 November 1501, the marriage ceremony finally took place at Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral; both Arthur and Catherine wore white satin. The ceremony was conducted by Henry Deane, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was assisted by William Warham, Bishop of London. Following the ceremony, Arthur and Catherine left the Cathedral and headed for Baynard&#x27;s Castle, where they were entertained by &quot;the best voiced children of the King&#x27;s chapel, who sang right sweetly with quaint harmony&quot;.

What followed was a bedding ceremony laid down by Arthur&#x27;s grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort: the bed was sprinkled with holy water, after which Catherine was led away from the wedding feast by her ladies-in-waiting. She was undressed, veiled and &quot;reverently&quot; laid in bed, while Arthur, &quot;in his shirt, with a gown cast about him,&quot; was escorted by his gentlemen into the bedchamber as viols and tabors played. The Bishop of London blessed the bed, and prayed for the marriage to be fruitful, after which the couple were left alone. This is the only public bedding of a royal couple recorded in Britain in the 16th century.

== Death ==
After residing at Tickenhill Manor for a month, Arthur and Catherine headed for the Welsh Marches, where they established their household at Ludlow Castle. Arthur had been growing weaker since his wedding, and Henry VII thus seemed reluctant to allow Catherine to follow him, until ultimately ordering her to join her husband.

Arthur found it easy to govern Wales, as the border had become quiet after many centuries of warfare. In March 1502, Arthur and Catherine were afflicted by an unknown illness, &quot;a malign vapour which proceeded from the air.&quot; It has been suggested that this illness was the mysterious English sweating sickness, tuberculosis (&quot;consumption&quot;), plague or influenza. While Catherine recovered, Arthur died on 2 April 1502 at Ludlow, six months short of his sixteenth birthday.

News of Arthur&#x27;s death reached Henry VII&#x27;s court late on 4 April. The King was awoken from his sleep by his confessor, who quoted Job by asking Henry &quot;If we receive good things at the hands of God, why may we not endure evil things?&quot; He then told the king that &quot;[his] dearest son hath departed to God,&quot; and Henry burst into tears. &quot;Grief-stricken and emotional,&quot; he then had his wife, Elizabeth, brought into his chambers, so that they might &quot;take the painful news together&quot;; Elizabeth reminded Henry that God had helped him become king and &quot;had ever preserved him,&quot; adding that they had been left with &quot;yet a fair Prince and two fair princesses and that God is where he was, and [they were] both young enough.&quot; Soon after leaving Henry&#x27;s bedchamber, Elizabeth collapsed and began to cry, while the ladies sent for the King, who hurriedly came and &quot;relieved her.&quot;

On 8 April, a general procession took place for the salvation of Arthur&#x27;s soul. That night, a dirge was sung in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and every parish church in London. On 23 April, Arthur&#x27;s body, which had previously been embalmed, sprinkled with holy water and sheltered with a canopy, was carried out of Ludlow Castle and into the Parish Church of Ludlow by various noblemen and gentlemen. On 25 April, Arthur&#x27;s body was taken to Worcester Cathedral via the River Severn, in a &quot;special wagon upholstered in black and drawn by six horses, also caparisoned in black.&quot; As was customary, Catherine did not attend the funeral. Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Surrey acted as chief mourner. At the end of the ceremony, Sir William Uvedale, Sir Richard Croft and Arthur&#x27;s household ushers broke their staves of office and threw them into the Prince&#x27;s grave. During the funeral, Arthur&#x27;s own arms were shown alongside those of Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd and Brutus of Troy. Two years later, a chantry was erected over Arthur&#x27;s grave.

== Legacy ==

Shortly after Arthur&#x27;s death, the idea of betrothing the widowed Catherine to the new heir apparent, Henry, had arisen; Henry VII and Isabella I were keen on moving forward with the betrothal and the pope granted a dispensation towards that end. Henry VIII ascended the throne on 22 April 1509 and married Arthur&#x27;s widow on 11 June. They had six children; their three sons died before reaching three months of age, one daughter was stillborn, and another lived for only a week. The couple&#x27;s surviving child was Mary I (b. 1516). In 1526, Henry started to pursue the affections of Anne Boleyn. At the same time, he became troubled by what became known as the King&#x27;s &quot;great matter&quot;, that is, finding an appropriate solution for his lack of male descendants. It soon became the King&#x27;s wish to dissolve his marriage and marry Anne, who was more likely to bear children.

Henry believed that his marriage was cursed, and believed he found confirmation in the Bible, in . Although in the morning following his wedding, Arthur had claimed that he was thirsty &quot;&quot;for I have been in the midst of Spain last night&quot; and that &quot;having a wife is a good pastime&quot;&quot;, these claims are generally dismissed by modern historians as mere boasts of a boy who did not want others to know of his failure. Until the day she died, Catherine maintained that she had married Henry while still a virgin. After Henry&#x27;s constant support of the claim that Catherine&#x27;s first marriage had been consummated, an annulment was issued on 23 May 1533, while the King had already married Anne on 25 January. Anne was beheaded for high treason in 1536, after which Henry proceeded to marry four more times. At the time of his death in 1547, Henry only had three living children; the only son, Edward VI, succeeded but died six years later. His successors were Henry&#x27;s daughters by Catherine and Anne, Mary I and Elizabeth I. Upon Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1603, the House of Tudor came to an end.

In 2002, following the initiative of canon Ian MacKenzie, Arthur&#x27;s funeral was reenacted with a requiem mass at Worcester Cathedral, on occasion of the quincentenary of his death. Despite his role in English history, Arthur has remained largely forgotten since his death.

Henry VIII owned a portrait of Arthur wearing a &quot;red cap with a brooch upon it, and a collar of red and white roses&quot;. A portrait of Arthur was rediscovered by English art dealer Philip Mould.

The stained-glass image of Arthur Tudor praying is in the west window of the nave in St Laurence&#x27;s Church in Ludlow, Shropshire where he died at the castle in 1502. Arthur&#x27;s bowels (called euphemistically &quot;the heart&quot;) had been buried in a lead box in the church&#x27;s choir but were noted in 1723 as having been &quot;taken up not long since&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
Arthur has been featured in several historical fiction novels, such as &quot;The King&#x27;s Pleasure&quot;, by Norah Lofts, &quot;Three Sisters, Three Queens&quot; by Philippa Gregory and &quot;Katherine, The Virgin Widow&quot;, by Jean Plaidy. In &quot;The Constant Princess&quot;, by Philippa Gregory, Catherine promises Arthur to marry his brother, thus fulfilling not only her own destiny of becoming Queen of England but also the couple&#x27;s plans for the future of the kingdom. &quot;The Alteration&quot;, by Kingsley Amis, is an alternate history novel centred on the &quot;War of the English Succession&quot; during which Henry VIII attempts to usurp the throne of his nephew, Stephen II, Arthur and Catherine&#x27;s son.

The historical drama &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; was broadcast in 1970, with Martin Ratcliffe as &quot;Prince Arthur&quot;. In 1972, BBC2 aired a historical miniseries titled &quot;The Shadow of the Tower&quot;, with &quot;Lord Arthur, Prince of Wales&quot; played by Jason Kemp. He is portrayed by Angus Imrie in 2019 period drama &quot;The Spanish Princess&quot;.

<text>Hillous Buel &quot;Bew&quot; Butrum (April 21, 1928 – April 27, 2002) was an American country music guitar player and a record and video producer best known as being a member of Hank Williams&#x27; Drifting Cowboys.

Hillous Butrum was born in Lafayette, Tennessee. Butrum found his way to Nashville and landed a job at WSM Radio. He eventually wound up a staff musician on the Grand Ole Opry, at age 16. From there, he played bass for Hank Williams&#x27; band &quot;The Drifting Cowboys.&quot; He would play with the Drifting Cowboys from 1949 until 1950. After the passing of Williams, Butrum joined Hank Snow&#x27;s band, the Rainbow Ranch Boys, and later played on many Marty Robbins recording sessions. He&#x27;d eventually start a music publishing company with Robbins.

He established &quot;Butrum Enterprises Publishing Company&quot; and owned Look Records. He produced many early country music documentaries including &quot;Music City USA&quot;. Butrum would tour again, from 1977 to 1984, with the reformed Drifting Cowboys.

Later in life, Butrum became active in the &quot;Reunion of Professional Entertainers,&quot; and distributed vintage country music videos through Nashville retail stores and his website.

Hillous Butrum died in his Nashville home about two weeks after the death of his wife Phyllis (Frost) Butrum. His funeral was held in Goodlettsville, Tennessee and was attended by notable music industry figures including Hal Bynum, Merle Kilgore, Bobby Tomberlin, Robbie Wittkowski, Tim Jones, and Don Helms. He was interred in the Underwood Cemetery in his hometown of Lafayette.

The day before Butrum&#x27;s death, he agreed to an exclusive interview with &quot;Country Music Source&quot; magazine detailing his long and inspiring music career. The interview was scheduled for April 29, 2002. In lieu of the interview, &quot;Country Music Source&quot; printed a memoriam for Butrum.

<text>The flag of Missouri, often referred to as the Missouri flag, is the state flag of the U.S. state of Missouri. It consists of a triband of three equal horizontal stripes colored red, white, and blue, with the arms from the Great Seal of Missouri in the center. Designed by Mary Elizabeth Oliver, the red and white stripes represent valor and purity, respectively. The blue stripe represents the permanency, vigilance, and justice of the state. The three colors also highlight the French influence on the state in its early years. The Missouri flag was established on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the State flag act making it official.

== History ==
The design of the state flag has been modified officially once since 1861. The current version is the longest-used and has been in use since .

=== First flag ===

Missouri did not have an official flag until Major-General Sterling Price, commander of the Missouri State Guard, ordered on June 5, 1861:

 Each regiment will adopt the State flag, made of blue merino, 6 by 5 feet, with the Missouri coat-of-arms in gold gilt on each side.

=== Flag Act of 1913 ===

The Missouri state flag was designed and stitched in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, by Marie Elizabeth Oliver, the wife of former state senator R. B. Oliver. She began his flag project in 1908 as part of her volunteer activities with the Daughters of the American Revolution when she was appointed chairperson of the Daughters of the American Revolution committee to research and design Missouri&#x27;s flag. Oliver researched state flags extensively. She wrote each state&#x27;s secretary of state for information about how their state&#x27;s flags had been designed and officially adopted. Her original design incorporated Missouri&#x27;s coat of arms and was rendered as a painted paper flag by her friend Mary Kochitzky.

The flag was brought to the Missouri State Capitol in 1908 and bills to adopt the flag as the official flag of Missouri were introduced by Senator Arthur L. Oliver, her nephew, in 1909 and 1911. Both bills failed to pass in the House. A competing flag design, by G. H. Holcomb and referred to as the &quot;Holcomb flag&quot;, was opposed due to its resemblance to the flag of the United States and its lack of Missouri symbolism. Oliver&#x27;s original paper flag was destroyed when the Missouri State Capitol burned in 1911. With Mrs. S. D. MacFarland, Oliver sewed a second flag out of silk. Her design was adopted on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the Oliver Flag Bill. The flag design remains unchanged to this day. The silk flag was kept by Marie Oliver until 1961 when her son Allen gave it to the state of Missouri. The flag was displayed until it began to deteriorate and was put into storage. In 1988, Secretary of State Roy D. Blunt issued a challenge to elementary students to raise money to restore the flag. The campaign was successful and the restored flag has been displayed in the James C. Kirkpatrick State Information Center in Jefferson City ever since.

The Oliver-Leming House, also known as the Home of the Missouri State Flag, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

== Design ==
The flag is a tricolor consisting of three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue which resembles the flag of the Netherlands. These represent valor, purity, vigilance, and justice. The colors also reflect the state&#x27;s historic status as part of French Louisiana. In the center white stripe is the seal of Missouri, circled by a blue band containing 24 stars, symbolizing Missouri&#x27;s admission as the 24th U.S. state.

It is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being the flag of California. It is also one of nine U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wyoming.

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial flags. The Missouri flag ranked in the bottom 25, 48th out of the 72.

<text>A reserve currency is a foreign currency that is held in significant quantities by central banks or other monetary authorities as part of their foreign exchange reserves. The reserve currency can be used in international transactions, international investments and all aspects of the global economy. It is often considered a hard currency or safe-haven currency.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s pound sterling was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century. However, by the middle of the 20th century, the United States dollar had become the world&#x27;s dominant reserve currency.


==History==
Reserve currencies have come and gone with the evolution of the world’s geopolitical order. International currencies in the past have (excluding those discussed below) included the Greek drachma, coined in the fifth century BC, the Roman denarii, the Byzantine solidus and Islamic dinar of the middle-ages and the French franc.

The Venetian ducat and the Florentine florin became the gold-based currency of choice between Europe and the Arab world from the 13th to 16th centuries, since gold was easier than silver to mint in standard sizes and transport over long distances. It was the Spanish silver dollar, however, which created the first true global reserve currency recognized in Europe, Asia and the Americas from the 16th to 19th centuries due to abundant silver supplies from Spanish America.

While the Dutch guilder was a reserve currency of somewhat lesser scope, used between Europe and the territories of the Dutch colonial empire from the 17th to 18th centuries, it was also a silver standard currency fed with the output of Spanish-American mines flowing through the Spanish Netherlands. The Dutch, through the &quot;Amsterdam Wisselbank&quot; (the Bank of Amsterdam), were also the first to establish a reserve currency whose monetary unit was stabilized using practices familiar to modern central banking (as opposed to the Spanish dollar stabilized through American mine output and Spanish fiat) and which can be considered as the precursor to modern-day monetary policy.

It was therefore the Dutch which served as the model for bank money and reserve currencies stabilized by central banks, with the establishment of Bank of England in 1694 and the Bank of France in the 18th century. The British pound sterling, in particular, was poised to dislodge the Spanish dollar&#x27;s hegemony as the rest of the world transitioned to the gold standard in the last quarter of the 19th century. At that point, the UK was the primary exporter of manufactured goods and services, and over 60% of world trade was invoiced in pounds sterling. British banks were also expanding overseas; London was the world centre for insurance and commodity markets and British capital was the leading source of foreign investment around the world; sterling soon became the standard currency used for international commercial transactions. On continental Europe, the bimetallic standard of the French franc remained the unifying currency of several European countries and their colonies under the Latin Monetary Union, which was established in 1865. Peru, Colombia and Venezuela also adopted the system in the 1860s and 1870s.

Attempts were made in the interwar period to restore the gold standard. The British Gold Standard Act reintroduced the gold bullion standard in 1925, followed by many other countries. This led to relative stability, followed by deflation, but because the onset of the Great Depression and other factors, global trade greatly declined and the gold standard fell. Speculative attacks on the pound forced Britain entirely off the gold standard in 1931.
After World War II, the international financial system was governed by a formal agreement, the Bretton Woods system. Under this system, the United States dollar (USD) was placed deliberately as the anchor of the system, with the US government guaranteeing other central banks that they could sell their US dollar reserves at a fixed rate for gold.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the system suffered setbacks ostensibly due to problems pointed out by the Triffin dilemma—the conflict of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic objectives and long-term international objectives when a national currency also serves as a world reserve currency.

Additionally, in 1971 President Richard Nixon suspended the convertibility of the USD to gold, thus creating a fully fiat global reserve currency system. However, gold has persisted as a significant reserve asset since the collapse of the classical gold standard.

Following the 2020 economic recession, the IMF opined about the emergence of &quot;A New Bretton Woods Moment&quot; which could imply the need for a new global reserve currency system. (see below: § Calls for an alternative reserve currency)
==Global currency reserves==
The IMF publishes the aggregated &quot;Currency Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves&quot; (COFER) each quarter. The reserves of the individual reporting countries and institutions are confidential. Thus the following table is a limited view about the global currency reserves that only deals with allocated (i.e. reported) reserves:

==Theory==
Economists debate whether a single reserve currency will always dominate the global economy. Many have recently argued that one currency will almost always dominate due to network externalities (sometimes called &quot;the network effect&quot;), especially in the field of invoicing trade and denominating foreign debt securities, meaning that there are strong incentives to conform to the choice that dominates the marketplace. The argument is that, in the absence of sufficiently large shocks, a currency that dominates the marketplace will not lose much ground to challengers.

However, some economists, such as Barry Eichengreen, argue that this is not as true when it comes to the denomination of official reserves because the network externalities are not strong. As long as the currency&#x27;s market is sufficiently liquid, the benefits of reserve diversification are strong, as it insures against large capital losses. The implication is that the world may well soon begin to move away from a financial system dominated uniquely by the US dollar. In the first half of the 20th century, multiple currencies did share the status as primary reserve currencies. Although the British Sterling was the largest currency, both the French franc and the German mark shared large portions of the market until the First World War, after which the mark was replaced by the dollar. Since the Second World War, the dollar has dominated official reserves, but this is likely a reflection of the unusual domination of the American economy during this period, as well as official discouragement of reserve status from the potential rivals, Germany and Japan.

The top reserve currency is generally selected by the banking community for the strength and stability of the economy in which it is used. Thus, as a currency becomes less stable, or its economy becomes less dominant, bankers may over time abandon it for a currency issued by a larger or more stable economy. This can take a relatively long time, as recognition is important in determining a reserve currency. For example, it took many years after the United States overtook the United Kingdom as the world&#x27;s largest economy before the dollar overtook the pound sterling as the dominant global reserve currency. In 1944, when the US dollar was chosen as the world reference currency at Bretton Woods, it was only the second currency in global reserves.

The G8 also frequently issues public statements as to exchange rates. In the past due to the Plaza Accord, its predecessor bodies could directly manipulate rates to reverse large trade deficits.

==Major reserve currencies==
===United States dollar===
The United States dollar is the most widely held currency in the allocated reserves. As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the USD accounted for 58.36% of official foreign exchange reserves. This makes it somewhat easier for the United States to run higher trade deficits with greatly postponed economic ramifications or even postponing a currency crisis. Central bank US dollar reserves, however, are small compared to private holdings of such debt. If non-United States holders of dollar-denominated assets decided to shift holdings to assets denominated in other currencies, then there could be serious consequences for the US economy. The decline of the pound sterling took place gradually over time, and the markets involved adjusted accordingly.

However, the US dollar remains the preferred reserve currency because of its stability due to scale and liquidity.

The US dollar&#x27;s position in global reserves is often questioned because of the growing share of unallocated reserves, and because of the doubt regarding dollar stability in the long term. However, in the aftermath of the 2008 to 2010 financial crisis, the dollar&#x27;s share in the world&#x27;s foreign-exchange trades rose slightly from 85% in 2010 to 87% in 2013.

The dollar&#x27;s role as the undisputed reserve currency of the world allows the United States to impose unilateral sanctions against actions performed between other countries, for example the American fine against BNP Paribas for violations of U.S. sanctions that were not laws of France or the other countries involved in the transactions. In 2014, China and Russia signed a 150 billion yuan central bank liquidity swap line agreement to get around European and American sanctions on their behaviors.

===Euro===

The euro is currently the second most commonly held reserve currency, representing about 20% of international foreign currency reserves. After World War II and the rebuilding of the German economy, the German mark gained the status of the second most important reserve currency after the US dollar. When the euro was introduced on 1 January 1999, replacing the mark, French franc and ten other European currencies, it inherited the status of a major reserve currency from the mark. Since then, its contribution to official reserves has risen continually as banks seek to diversify their reserves, and trade in the eurozone continues to expand.

After the euro&#x27;s share of global official foreign exchange reserves approached 25% as of year-end 2006 (vs 65% for the U.S. dollar; see table above), some experts have predicted that the euro could replace the dollar as the world&#x27;s primary reserve currency. See Alan Greenspan, 2007;
and Frankel, Chinn (2006) who explained how it could happen by 2020.
However, as of 2022 none of this has come to fruition due to the European debt crisis which engulfed the PIIGS countries from 2009 to 2014. Instead the euro&#x27;s stability and future existence was put into doubt, and its share of global reserves was cut to 19% by year-end 2015 (vs 66% for the USD). As of year-end 2020 these figures stand at 21% for EUR and 59% for USD.

===Pound sterling===
The United Kingdom&#x27;s pound sterling was the primary reserve currency of much of the world in the 19th century and first half of the 20th century. That status ended after the UK almost bankrupted itself fighting World War I and World War II, and its place was taken by the United States dollar.

In the 1950s, 55% of global reserves were still held in sterling; but the share was 10% lower within 20 years.

The establishment of the U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913 and the economic vacuum following the World Wars facilitated the emergence of the United States as an economic superpower.

, the pound sterling represented the fourth largest proportion (by USD equivalent value) of foreign currency reserves and 4.78% of those reserves.

===Japanese yen===
Japan&#x27;s yen is part of the International Monetary Fund&#x27;s (IMF) special drawing rights (SDR) valuation. The SDR currency value is determined daily by the IMF, based on the exchange rates of the currencies making up the basket, as quoted at noon at the London market. The valuation basket is reviewed and adjusted every five years.

The SDR Values and yen conversion for government procurement are used by the Japan External Trade Organization for Japan&#x27;s official procurement in international trade.

===Chinese renminbi===
The Chinese renminbi officially became a supplementary forex reserve asset on 1 October 2016. It represents 10.92% of the IMF&#x27;s Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency basket. The Chinese renmimbi is the third reserve currency after the U.S. dollar and euro within the basket of currencies in the SDR. (As shown in the table above, the renmimbi is the sixth largest component of international currency reserves.)

===Canadian dollar===
A number of central banks (and commercial banks) keep Canadian dollars as a reserve currency. In the economy of the Americas, the Canadian dollar plays a similar role to that played by the Australian dollar (AUD) in the Asia-Pacific region. The Canadian dollar (as a regional reserve currency for banking) has been an important part of the British, French and Dutch Caribbean states&#x27; economies and finance systems since the 1950s. The Canadian dollar is also held by many central banks in Central America and South America. It is held in Latin America because of remittances and international trade in the region.

Because Canada&#x27;s primary foreign-trade relationship is with the United States, Canadian consumers, economists, and many businesses primarily define and value the Canadian dollar in terms of the United States dollar. Thus, by observing how the Canadian dollar floats in terms of the US dollar, foreign-exchange economists can indirectly observe internal behaviours and patterns in the US economy that could not be seen by direct observation. Also, because it is considered a petrodollar, the Canadian dollar has only fully evolved into a global reserve currency since the 1970s, when it was floated against all other world currencies.

The Canadian dollar, from 2013 to 2017, was ranked fifth among foreign currency reserves in the world, overtaking Australian Dollar, but is then being overtaken by Chinese Yuan.

===Swiss franc===
The Swiss franc, despite gaining ground among the world&#x27;s foreign-currency reserves and being often used in denominating foreign loans, cannot be considered as a world reserve currency, since the share of all foreign exchange reserves held in Swiss francs has historically been well below 0.5%. The daily trading market turnover of the franc, however, ranked fifth, or about 3.4%, among all currencies in a 2007 survey by the Bank for International Settlements.

==Calls for an alternative reserve currency==
John Maynard Keynes proposed the bancor, a supranational currency to be used as unit of account in international trade, as reserve currency under the Bretton Woods Conference of 1945. The bancor was rejected in favor of the U.S. dollar.

A report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 2010, called for abandoning the U.S. dollar as the single major reserve currency. The report states that the new reserve system should not be based on a single currency or even multiple national currencies but instead permit the emission of international liquidity to create a more stable global financial system.

Countries such as Russia and China, central banks, and economic analysts and groups, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, have expressed a desire to see an independent new currency replace the dollar as the reserve currency. However, it is recognized that the US dollar remains the strongest reserve currency.

On 10 July 2009, Russian President Medvedev proposed a new &#x27;World currency&#x27; at the G8 meeting in London as an alternative reserve currency to replace the dollar.

At the beginning of the 21st century, gold and crude oil were still priced in dollars, which helps export inflation and has brought complaints about OPEC&#x27;s policies of managing oil quotas to maintain dollar price stability.

Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and international sanctions, Russia has used the United Arab Emirates dirham as a neutral currency when selling oil to India.

===Special drawing rights===
Some have proposed the use of the International Monetary Fund&#x27;s (IMF) special drawing rights (SDRs) as a reserve. The value of SDRs are calculated from a basket determined by the IMF of key international currencies, which as of 2016 consisted of the United States dollar, euro, renminbi, yen, and pound sterling.

Ahead of a G20 summit in 2009, China distributed a paper that proposed using SDRs for clearing international payments and eventually as a reserve currency to replace the U.S. dollar.

On 3 September 2009, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) issued a report calling for a new reserve currency based on the SDR, managed by a new global reserve bank. The IMF released a report in February 2011, stating that using SDRs &quot;could help stabilize the global financial system.&quot; The SDR itself is only a minuscule fraction of global currency reserves.

=== Cryptocurrencies ===
According to some cryptocurrency proponents, digital cryptocurrencies could potentially replace fiat currencies as a possible global reserve currency.

<text>Iron Butterfly was an American rock band formed in San Diego, California, in 1966. They are best known for the 1968 hit &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;, providing a dramatic sound that led the way towards the development of hard rock and heavy metal music. Although their heyday was the late 1960s, the band has been reformed with various members with varying levels of success with no new recordings since 1975. Their second album, &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; (1968), remains a best-seller, and Iron Butterfly was the first group to receive an in-house platinum album award from Atlantic Records.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Heavy&quot; (1966–1968)===
The band formed in 1966 in San Diego. The original members were Doug Ingle (vocals, organ, formerly of Jeri and the Jeritones and Palace Pages, Iron Butterfly&#x27;s forerunner), Jack Pinney (drums), Greg Willis (bass), and Danny Weis (guitar, also of Palace Pages). The group were soon joined by vocalist and tambourine player Darryl DeLoach. DeLoach&#x27;s parents’ garage served as the site for their almost nightly rehearsals.

Jerry Penrod replaced Willis after the band relocated to Los Angeles in the summer of 1966. Pinney eventually left to return to school. Bruce Morse then replaced Pinney until Ron Bushy (from a group called the Voxmen) joined when Morse left due to a family emergency. A booking at Bido Lito&#x27;s club in Hollywood soon led to regular appearances at the Galaxy Club and the Whisky a Go Go.

In early 1968, after the band signed a deal with Atco Records, an Atlantic Records subsidiary, the band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Heavy&quot; was released. The group was signed and managed by Atlantic&#x27;s Charles Greene and Brian Stone, who were co-producers of &quot;Heavy&quot;. All but Ingle and Bushy left the band after completing the album in the late summer of 1967. The two remaining musicians, faced with the possibility of the record not being released, quickly found replacements in bassist Lee Dorman and 17-year-old guitarist Erik Brann (also known as &quot;Erik Braunn&quot; and &quot;Erik Braun&quot;) and resumed touring. In a 1986 interview with IB&#x27;s fan club fanzine, &quot;The Butterfly Net&quot;, Brann stated that Jeff Beck, Neil Young, and Michael Monarch (who would go on to join Steppenwolf) had also expressed interest in joining the group to replace Weis.

After Brann was chosen, Penrod and DeLoach, uncomfortable with Brann&#x27;s young age and frustrated with the time it was taking him to learn the band&#x27;s repertoire, left the group after Weis did. Weis and Penrod went on to form the group Rhinoceros. In 1970 DeLoach formed Flintwhistle along with Jerry Penrod and Erik Brann. They performed live for about a year before breaking up.

===Success with &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; and first breakup (1968–1971)===

The 17-minute &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;, the title track of Iron Butterfly&#x27;s second album, became a top-30 hit (edited down to 2:52) in the U. S. The album was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in December 1968. The album stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for 140 weeks and ultimately sold over 30 million copies.

During this time, the band was represented by the William Morris Agency, which booked all their live concerts. Iron Butterfly played its first national tour in the summer of 1968 alongside Jefferson Airplane. By the end of 1968, the band was back in the studio at work on their next album. Iron Butterfly&#x27;s third album, &quot;Ball&quot;, was released in January 1969 and went gold, reaching #3 on the Billboard charts.

The band had been booked to play at Woodstock in August 1969 but got stuck at New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport. They explained their situation to the concert promoters and asked for patience. Their manager, however, sent a telegram demanding that Iron Butterfly be flown in by helicopter, whereupon they would &quot;immediately&quot; take the stage. After their set, they would be paid and flown back to the airport. According to drummer Bushy, &quot;We went down to the Port Authority three times and waited for the helicopter, but it never showed up&quot;. Woodstock production coordinator John Morris claims he sent the manager a telegram reading: &quot;For reasons I can&#x27;t go into / Until you are here / Clarifying your situation / Knowing you are having problems / You will have to find / Other transportation / Unless you plan not to come.&quot; The acrostic formed by the first letter of each line in the telegram made it clear that the band was not welcome.

Erik Brann left the band after a final show in San Diego on December 13, 1969. Brann was frustrated with the band&#x27;s unwillingness to move towards a harder rock sound. He was replaced in the line-up by two new musicians: guitarist/vocalist Mike Pinera (whose Blues Image had opened for Iron Butterfly&#x27;s Vida tour) and guitarist Larry Reinhardt (from the Allman Brothers Band forerunner Second Coming). Both Pinera and Larry &quot;Rhino&quot; Reinhardt had been rehearsing secretly with the band since September 1969 after Brann had voiced his objections to continuing. In August 1970 Iron Butterfly released its fourth studio album &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;. The album managed to get into the Billboard top 20.

While Iron Butterfly was touring in Europe with Yes in early 1971, Doug Ingle announced his intention to leave the group. Ingle had grown tired of endless touring and wasn&#x27;t totally on board with the band&#x27;s new guitar-oriented blues and soul direction. The remaining four members cut the 45 rpm single, &quot;Silly Sally&quot; (with Bushy eventually being replaced on the record by a session drummer, at the producer&#x27;s prompting). Putting forth a horn-based sound more characteristic of groups like Blood Sweat and Tears, the single failed to chart and proved to be their last recording before their mid-1970s reformation.

The band, with Ingle in tow, decided to play one final tour, pairing with Black Oak Arkansas. Pinera&#x27;s band-mate from Blues Image, drummer Manny Bertematti, filled in for Bushy for most of the tour dates because of the latter&#x27;s shoulder injury. The group then broke up after playing the tour&#x27;s final show at Central Oregon Community College in Bend, Oregon on May 23, 1971. Another reason for the band not continuing at this time, according to a later interview by Pinera, was the U. S. Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s effort to collect unpaid taxes.

Dorman and Reinhardt subsequently founded Captain Beyond.

===Reunions (1974–2011)===
In 1974 Brann was contacted by a promoter about reforming Iron Butterfly, so he reunited with Ron Bushy to form a new version of the group, signing with MCA Records and joined by Bushy&#x27;s friend, bassist Philip Taylor Kramer, and keyboardist Howard Reitzes, a friend of Brann&#x27;s who worked in a music store. Brann, who had done occasional lead vocals during Iron Butterfly&#x27;s original run, served as the band&#x27;s main lead vocalist this time. Their first album for MCA, &quot;Scorching Beauty&quot;, was released in January 1975, and Reitzes was replaced by Bill DeMartines just after its release. The new lineup toured throughout the year and released &quot;Sun and Steel&quot; in October 1975 with DeMartines now on keyboards. Both albums were criticized for bearing little resemblance to the original tone of the group and sold poorly compared to their earlier releases.

In 1977 the Bushy/Brann/Kramer/DeMartines grouping wound down after being plagued with bad management and tour dates that had started off in theaters but ended up in bars and clubs. Bushy, Kramer and DeMartines formed Magic and Lee Dorman put together a new IB lineup with Rhino that contained British singer Jimi Henderson, Larry Kiernan on keyboards, David Love on guitar and Kevin Karamitros on drums. This grouping toured mostly in the South. By 1978 the lineup was Dorman, Karamitros, Pinera and John Leimseider on keyboards.

In the late fall of 1978, a German promoter made an offer for the band to tour. The &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; lineup (Ingle, Bushy, Dorman, Pinera and Rhino) made preparations, but just before they were to depart for Germany, Dorman&#x27;s father took ill and another bassist, Keith Ellis (formerly of Boxer), was brought in to cover for Dorman in case he had to suddenly return to the US. During the tour, Ellis died in Darmstadt, Germany on December 12, 1978.

After their return to the US, the &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; group played a few homecoming shows in early 1979, joined by Erik Brann for guest appearances. Later in 1979, Bushy returned to his other group, Gold, and the next IB lineup was: Mike Pinera, Lee Dorman, Doug Ingle, a returning John Leimseider and Dorman&#x27;s Captain Beyond band-mate, drummer Bobby Caldwell. Still later that same year, Bobby Hasbrook, from Hawaii, joined the band as lead guitarist and lead vocals alongside Dorman, Pinera, Caldwell and Leimseider.

IB&#x27;s lineup was in a constant state of flux from late 1979 on as exhibited in the following groupings: Brann, Dorman, Leimseider, Caldwell and Hasbrook (1979); Pinera, Brann, Dorman, Hasbrook, Caldwell and Nathan Pino – keyboards (1979); Dorman, Brann, Hasbrook, Tim Kislan – keyboards, Zam Johnson – drums and Starz Vanderlocket – vocals, percussion (1980); Dorman, Rhino, Leimseider, Randy Skirvin – guitar, Jimmy Rock – drums and Luke – vocals, percussion (1981–1982); Pinera, Dorman, Rhino, Guy Babylon – keyboards and Jan Uvena – drums (1982) plus Pinera, Dorman, Rhino, Babylon and Bushy (1982).

On July 31, 1982, the Pinera, Dorman, Rhino, Babylon and Bushy lineup went into Music Sound Connection Studio in Studio City, California to record some material, none of which has ever been released.

At the tail end of 1982, Ingle returned to the fold once more as John Shearer (from Steve Hackett&#x27;s band) came in on drums and percussionist Luke also rejoined since Bushy had taken a sales job outside of music for Makita Tools. Brann (who had guested at some shows during 1982) soon ended his association with the band at this time as well.

Pinera left again, as did Luke, in 1983 and IB worked on some more material in September of that year, with drummer Jerry Sommers playing on some tracks. But once again, nothing ever came of it.

Then Ingle, Dorman, Rhino and drummer Rick Rotante undertook the &quot;Wings of Flight Tour&quot; in early 1984, with Lenny Campanero (ex-Badfinger) replacing Rotante for more recording sessions at Salty Dog Studios in Van Nuys, California.

The &quot;Legends Tour&quot; took place in the fall of 1984 with Ingle, Dorman, Campanero and guitarist Steve Fister (later of Steppenwolf) and another Steppenwolf alumnus, bassist Kurtis Teel, took Dorman&#x27;s spot for the &quot;Phoenix Tour&quot; in the fall of &#x27;85, which ended in late November, shortly after which, Teel suddenly died of a heart murmur on December 2. The group then disbanded once again due to managerial problems.

In the spring of 1987, Bushy and Pinera got back together to tour as Iron Butterfly for the &quot;Wings of Flight 87&quot; tour (Dorman was captaining a fishing boat, so was not available at this time) with Ace Baker (keyboards) and Kelly Reubens (bass). Tim Von Hoffman and Glen Rappold (guitar, bass) soon replaced Ace Baker and drummer Donny Vosburgh (who&#x27;d been in Thee Image with Pinera) guested at some of these 1987 shows and subbed for Bushy on others. But this was short-lived, as Bushy and then Brann both rehearsed different IB lineups in August and September of that year (see Lineups below) that never made it to the concert stage.
In December 1987 the &quot;classic lineup&quot; of Ingle, Brann, Dorman and Bushy got together at The Roxy Theatre to prepare for a thirty date tour of the East Coast in the winter and spring of 1988 that culminated with an appearance at Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary celebration at Madison Square Garden on May 14, 1988, alongside Led Zeppelin and many others.

After this, Brann and Dorman decided to continue on, bringing in Rhino, keyboardist Derek Hilland and drummer Sal Rodriguez (replaced by Kenny Suarez). They were joined by singer/frontman Steve &quot;Mick&quot; Feldman and backup singers JoAnne Kurman-Montana and Cecelia Noel also appeared with the band for a few shows in 1989, as well as another drummer, Doug Freedman, who subbed for Suarez in the fall of &#x27;89. The 1989 IB lineup of Brann, Dorman, Rhino, Hilland, Feldman and Suarez appeared at Woodstock &#x27;89, which took place in August 1989 twenty years to the day of and on the site of the original Woodstock concert of 1969 as a spontaneous celebration of the event&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

In 1990 after Brann fell out with the others and left Iron Butterfly for good, Dorman, Rhino, Hilland and Suarez recorded an album with singer Robert Tepper that was meant to be an IB album called &quot;We Will Rise&quot; but instead was shelved and eventually reworked into Tepper&#x27;s 1996 solo album, &quot;No Rest For The Wounded Heart&quot;.

After the Tepper-led lineup failed to break through, Tepper left to continue his solo career and Dorman, Rhino and Bushy went back on the road in early 1993 with keyboardist Burt Diaz. But after Rhino and Diaz decided to leave, Pinera was brought back, along with keyboardist Hilland. Pinera, by this time, had formed his own group, the Classic Rock All-Stars, so was not available for all of the Butterfly&#x27;s shows. Guitarist Denny Artache (summer 1993), then Doug Bossey (1994), filled in until Pinera was dropped in 1994, with Bossey, then Eric Barnett finally taking over (in 1995).
Doug Ingle rejoined the band in July 1994. In the spring of 1997 the band did a tour of Europe with &quot;classic era&quot; members Ingle, Bushy and Dorman, along with Hilland and Barnett. A DVD of live performances from this tour was released in 2008. Hilland was dropped in 1997 and Ingle officially retired from performing in early 1999. Ingle died in May 2024. Singer/keysman Damian Bujanda had a brief tenure, but after leaving for personal reasons, Larry Rust joined the band as vocalist/keyboardist from 1999 to 2005.

In 2001, after Dorman took ill, one of the band&#x27;s road crew, Oly Larios, sat in on bass. 
Guitarist/vocalist Charlie Marinkovich joined the band in 2002. Originally from Seattle, Marinkovich had played with Randy Hansen and others.

Original vocalist Darryl DeLoach (born on September 12, 1947) died of liver cancer on October 2, 2002, at age 55.

On July 25, 2003, Erik Brann died of heart failure at the age of 52.

Derek Hilland returned to play keyboards for the group&#x27;s 2003 dates when Larry Rust was not available.

Larry Rust parted ways with the band in 2005 and was replaced by German violinist, keyboardist, and composer Martin Gerschwitz, who had formerly worked with Lita Ford, Meat Loaf, Walter Trout, and most recently Eric Burdon and The Animals.

In early 2010, an announcement was made that Iron Butterfly would receive the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 20th Annual San Diego Music Awards, which took place on September 12, 2010. The award was presented by San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders. Later the same year, Ray Weston (formerly of Wishbone Ash) came in to substitute on drums for Ron Bushy after he was sidelined by health issues.

In early 2012, Phil Parlapiano substituted for Martin Gerschwitz for a few shows when Gerschwitz was unable to play due to his own solo-tour schedule.

===Deaths of Reinhardt and Dorman, and inactivity (2012–2014)===
Former guitarist Larry &quot;Rhino&quot; Reinhardt died on January 2, 2012, at the age of 63, due to cirrhosis of the liver. Bassist Lee Dorman, who had a history of heart trouble, died on December 21, 2012, at the age of 70. Both Reinhardt and Dorman were also founding members of Captain Beyond.

Following Dorman&#x27;s death, Iron Butterfly dissolved once more. Charlie Marinkovich revealed in 2013 that he had departed the band altogether and that Ron Bushy was very ill, shrouding the band&#x27;s future in doubt. At times during his recovery in 2014, Ron Bushy entertained the idea of putting a new Iron Butterfly band together, possibly with Martin Gerschwitz returning on keyboards and lead vocals.

=== Third reunion/tribute band and deaths of Ron Bushy, Doug Ingle and Mike Pinera (2015–present)===
In late 2014, reports surfaced of the band reforming, with a lineup consisting of Bushy, Mike Pinera, Doug Ingle Jr. on keyboards and an unnamed bassist. However, this reformation did not come to fruition and in 2015 the band unveiled a lineup consisting of Bushy and returning guitarist Eric Barnett, along with new members Mike Green (vocals, percussion), Dave Meros (bass), Phil Parlapiano (vocals, keyboards) and Ray Weston (drums). Meros, Parlapiano and Weston had all previously played with Iron Butterfly as substitute musicians; Meros for Dorman (in 2006) Parlapiano for Gerschwitz (in 2012) and Weston for Bushy (in 2010) respectively. Gerschwitz came back to replace Parlapiano on keyboards in 2018.

At that time, Ron Bushy was still involved with Iron Butterfly, but was retired from performing due to his health concerns. This left Weston as the only active drummer in the band at all appearances from the 2015 reunion through the end of 2019. In the summer of 2018, Bushy made a rare guest appearance with the band at a gig in California. This turned out to be his first performance on stage with Iron Butterfly since 2012 and his very last one with the band.

Former Butterfly keyboardist Larry Rust died peacefully at his home near Los Angeles on November 25, 2016, at the age of 63. Founding bassist Greg Willis died on November 11, 2016. A tribute concert was staged November 30 at Nicky Rottens in El Cajon.

On January 15, 2020, the Official Iron Butterfly website and their booking agent announced the lineup of the band for 2020: Eric Barnett (guitar, vocals), Dave Meros (bass, vocals), Bernie Pershey (drums, percussion), Martin Gerschwitz (keyboards, vocals), with occasional guests or fill in musicians being Ron Bushy (drums, percussion), Ray Weston (drums, percussion) and Michael Thomas Franklin (keyboards).

On August 29, 2021, Iron Butterfly issued a statement that Bushy had died that morning at the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica following a battle with esophageal cancer, at the age of 79. Shortly after his passing, the band disbanded.

Doug Ingle died on May 24, 2024, at the age of 78. He was the last surviving member of the classic Iron Butterfly lineup that performed on the &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; album.

Mike Pinera died on November 20, 2024, of liver cancer, aged 76. Pinera was the last surviving member of the Iron Butterfly lineup that performed on &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. It can be classified also as a tessellation. In the simplest case, these objects are just finitely many points in the plane (called seeds, sites, or generators). For each seed there is a corresponding region, called a Voronoi cell, consisting of all points of the plane closer to that seed than to any other. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to that set&#x27;s Delaunay triangulation.

The Voronoi diagram is named after mathematician Georgy Voronoy, and is also called a Voronoi tessellation, a Voronoi decomposition, a Voronoi partition, or a Dirichlet tessellation (after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet). Voronoi cells are also known as Thiessen polygons, after Alfred H. Thiessen. Voronoi diagrams have practical and theoretical applications in many fields, mainly in science and technology, but also in visual art.

==Simplest case==
In the simplest case, shown in the first picture, we are given a finite set of points formula_1 in the Euclidean plane. In this case, each point formula_2 has a corresponding cell formula_3 consisting of the points in the Euclidean plane for which formula_2 is the nearest site: the distance to formula_2 is less than or equal to the minimum distance to any other site formula_6. For one other site formula_6, the points that are closer to formula_2 than to formula_6, or equally distant, form a closed half-space, whose boundary is the perpendicular bisector of line segment formula_10. Cell formula_3 is the intersection of all of these formula_12 half-spaces, and hence it is a convex polygon. When two cells in the Voronoi diagram share a boundary, it is a line segment, ray, or line, consisting of all the points in the plane that are equidistant to their two nearest sites. The vertices of the diagram, where three or more of these boundaries meet, are the points that have three or more equally distant nearest sites.

==Formal definition==
Let formula_13 be a metric space with distance function formula_14. Let formula_15 be a set of indices and let formula_16 be a tuple (indexed collection) of nonempty subsets (the sites) in the space formula_17. The Voronoi cell, or Voronoi region, formula_18, associated with the site formula_19 is the set of all points in formula_20 whose distance to formula_21 is not greater than their distance to the other sites formula_22, where formula_23 is any index different from formula_24. In other words, if formula_25 denotes the distance between the point formula_26 and the subset formula_27, then

formula_28

The Voronoi diagram is simply the tuple of cells formula_29. In principle, some of the sites can intersect and even coincide (an application is described below for sites representing shops), but usually they are assumed to be disjoint. In addition, infinitely many sites are allowed in the definition (this setting has applications in geometry of numbers and crystallography), but again, in many cases only finitely many sites are considered.

In the particular case where the space is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, each site is a point, there are finitely many points and all of them are different, then the Voronoi cells are convex polytopes and they can be represented in a combinatorial way using their vertices, sides, two-dimensional faces, etc. Sometimes the induced combinatorial structure is referred to as the Voronoi diagram. In general however, the Voronoi cells may not be convex or even connected.

In the usual Euclidean space, we can rewrite the formal definition in usual terms. Each Voronoi polygon formula_30 is associated with a generator point formula_19.
Let formula_20 be the set of all points in the Euclidean space. Let formula_33 be a point that generates its Voronoi region formula_34, formula_35 that generates formula_36, and formula_37 that generates formula_38, and so on. Then, as expressed by Tran &quot;et al&quot;, &quot;all locations in the Voronoi polygon are closer to the generator point of that polygon than any other generator point in the Voronoi diagram in Euclidean plane&quot;.

==Illustration==
As a simple illustration, consider a group of shops in a city. Suppose we want to estimate the number of customers of a given shop. With all else being equal (price, products, quality of service, etc.), it is reasonable to assume that customers choose their preferred shop simply by distance considerations: they will go to the shop located nearest to them. In this case the Voronoi cell formula_3 of a given shop formula_40 can be used for giving a rough estimate on the number of potential customers going to this shop (which is modeled by a point in our city).

For most cities, the distance between points can be measured using the familiar
Euclidean distance:

:formula_41

or the Manhattan distance:

:formula_42.

The corresponding Voronoi diagrams look different for different distance metrics.

==Properties==
* The dual graph for a Voronoi diagram (in the case of a Euclidean space with point sites) corresponds to the Delaunay triangulation for the same set of points.
* The closest pair of points corresponds to two adjacent cells in the Voronoi diagram.
* If the setting is the Euclidean plane and a discrete set of points is given, then two points of the set are adjacent on the convex hull if and only if their Voronoi cells share an infinitely long side.
* If the space is a normed space and the distance to each site is attained (e.g., when a site is a compact set or a closed ball), then each Voronoi cell can be represented as a union of line segments emanating from the sites. As shown there, this property does not necessarily hold when the distance is not attained.
* Under relatively general conditions (the space is a possibly infinite-dimensional uniformly convex space, there can be infinitely many sites of a general form, etc.) Voronoi cells enjoy a certain stability property: a small change in the shapes of the sites, e.g., a change caused by some translation or distortion, yields a small change in the shape of the Voronoi cells. This is the geometric stability of Voronoi diagrams. As shown there, this property does not hold in general, even if the space is two-dimensional (but non-uniformly convex, and, in particular, non-Euclidean) and the sites are points.

==History and research==
Informal use of Voronoi diagrams can be traced back to Descartes in 1644. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet used two-dimensional and three-dimensional Voronoi diagrams in his study of quadratic forms in 1850.
British physician John Snow used a Voronoi-like diagram in 1854 to illustrate how the majority of people who died in the Broad Street cholera outbreak lived closer to the infected Broad Street pump than to any other water pump.

Voronoi diagrams are named after Georgy Feodosievych Voronoy who defined and studied the general &quot;n&quot;-dimensional case in 1908. Voronoi diagrams that are used in geophysics and meteorology to analyse spatially distributed data are called Thiessen polygons after American meteorologist Alfred H. Thiessen, who used them to estimate rainfall from scattered measurements in 1911. Other equivalent names for this concept (or particular important cases of it): Voronoi polyhedra, Voronoi polygons, domain(s) of influence, Voronoi decomposition, Voronoi tessellation(s), Dirichlet tessellation(s).

==Examples==
Voronoi tessellations of regular lattices of points in two or three dimensions give rise to many familiar tessellations.
* A 2D lattice gives an irregular honeycomb tessellation, with equal hexagons with point symmetry; in the case of a regular triangular lattice it is regular; in the case of a rectangular lattice the hexagons reduce to rectangles in rows and columns; a square lattice gives the regular tessellation of squares; note that the rectangles and the squares can also be generated by other lattices (for example the lattice defined by the vectors (1,0) and (1/2,1/2) gives squares).
* A simple cubic lattice gives the cubic honeycomb.
* A hexagonal close-packed lattice gives a tessellation of space with trapezo-rhombic dodecahedra.
* A face-centred cubic lattice gives a tessellation of space with rhombic dodecahedra.
* A body-centred cubic lattice gives a tessellation of space with truncated octahedra.
* Parallel planes with regular triangular lattices aligned with each other&#x27;s centers give the hexagonal prismatic honeycomb.
* Certain body-centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra.

Certain body-centered tetragonal lattices give a tessellation of space with rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedra.

For the set of points (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) with &quot;x&quot; in a discrete set &quot;X&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in a discrete set &quot;Y&quot;, we get rectangular tiles with the points not necessarily at their centers.

==Higher-order Voronoi diagrams==
Although a normal Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points closest to a single point in &quot;S&quot;, an &quot;n&quot;th-order Voronoi cell is defined as the set of points having a particular set of &quot;n&quot; points in &quot;S&quot; as its &quot;n&quot; nearest neighbors. Higher-order Voronoi diagrams also subdivide space.

Higher-order Voronoi diagrams can be generated recursively. To generate the &quot;n&quot;th-order Voronoi diagram from set &quot;S&quot;, start with the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)th-order diagram and replace each cell generated by &quot;X&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1} with a Voronoi diagram generated on the set &quot;S&quot; − &quot;X&quot;.

===Farthest-point Voronoi diagram===
For a set of &quot;n&quot; points, the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)th-order Voronoi diagram is called a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.

For a given set of points &quot;S&quot; = {&quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;}, the farthest-point Voronoi diagram divides the plane into cells in which the same point of &quot;P&quot; is the farthest point. A point of &quot;P&quot; has a cell in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram if and only if it is a vertex of the convex hull of &quot;P&quot;. Let &quot;H&quot; = {&quot;h&quot;1, &quot;h&quot;2, ..., &quot;h&quot;&quot;k&quot;} be the convex hull of &quot;P&quot;; then the farthest-point Voronoi diagram is a subdivision of the plane into &quot;k&quot; cells, one for each point in &quot;H&quot;, with the property that a point &quot;q&quot; lies in the cell corresponding to a site &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; if and only if d(&quot;q&quot;, &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;) &gt; d(&quot;q&quot;, &quot;p&quot;&quot;j&quot;) for each &quot;p&quot;&quot;j&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot; with &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;p&quot;&quot;j&quot;, where d(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;) is the Euclidean distance between two points &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.

The boundaries of the cells in the farthest-point Voronoi diagram have the structure of a topological tree, with infinite rays as its leaves. Every finite tree is isomorphic to the tree formed in this way from a farthest-point Voronoi diagram.

==Generalizations and variations==
As implied by the definition, Voronoi cells can be defined for metrics other than Euclidean, such as the Mahalanobis distance or Manhattan distance. However, in these cases the boundaries of the Voronoi cells may be more complicated than in the Euclidean case, since the equidistant locus for two points may fail to be subspace of codimension 1, even in the two-dimensional case.
A weighted Voronoi diagram is the one in which the function of a pair of points to define a Voronoi cell is a distance function modified by multiplicative or additive weights assigned to generator points. In contrast to the case of Voronoi cells defined using a distance which is a metric, in this case some of the Voronoi cells may be empty. A power diagram is a type of Voronoi diagram defined from a set of circles using the power distance; it can also be thought of as a weighted Voronoi diagram in which a weight defined from the radius of each circle is added to the squared Euclidean distance from the circle&#x27;s center.

The Voronoi diagram of formula_43 points in formula_44-dimensional space can have formula_45 vertices, requiring the same bound for the amount of memory needed to store an explicit description of it. Therefore, Voronoi diagrams are often not feasible for moderate or high dimensions. A more space-efficient alternative is to use approximate Voronoi diagrams.

Voronoi diagrams are also related to other geometric structures such as the medial axis (which has found applications in image segmentation, optical character recognition, and other computational applications), straight skeleton, and zone diagrams.

==Applications==

=== Meteorology/Hydrology ===
It is used in meteorology and engineering hydrology to find the weights for precipitation data of stations over an area (watershed). The points generating the polygons are the various station that record precipitation data. Perpendicular bisectors are drawn to the line joining any two stations. This results in the formation of polygons around the stations. The area formula_46 touching station point is known as influence area of the station. The average precipitation is calculated by the formula formula_47

=== Humanities and social sciences===
*In classical archaeology, specifically art history, the symmetry of statue heads is analyzed to determine the type of statue a severed head may have belonged to. An example of this that made use of Voronoi cells was the identification of the Sabouroff head, which made use of a high-resolution polygon mesh.
*In dialectometry, Voronoi cells are used to indicate a supposed linguistic continuity between survey points.
*In political science, Voronoi diagrams have been used to study multi-dimensional, multi-party competition.

=== Natural sciences ===

*In biology, Voronoi diagrams are used to model a number of different biological structures, including cells and bone microarchitecture. Indeed, Voronoi tessellations work as a geometrical tool to understand the physical constraints that drive the organization of biological tissues.
*In hydrology, Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate the rainfall of an area, based on a series of point measurements. In this usage, they are generally referred to as Thiessen polygons.
*In ecology, Voronoi diagrams are used to study the growth patterns of forests and forest canopies, and may also be helpful in developing predictive models for forest fires.
*In ethology, Voronoi diagrams are used to model domains of danger in the selfish herd theory.
*In computational chemistry, ligand-binding sites are transformed into Voronoi diagrams for machine learning applications (e.g., to classify binding pockets in proteins). In other applications, Voronoi cells defined by the positions of the nuclei in a molecule are used to compute atomic charges. This is done using the Voronoi deformation density method.
*In astrophysics, Voronoi diagrams are used to generate adaptative smoothing zones on images, adding signal fluxes on each one. The main objective of these procedures is to maintain a relatively constant signal-to-noise ratio on all the images.
*In computational fluid dynamics, the Voronoi tessellation of a set of points can be used to define the computational domains used in finite volume methods, e.g. as in the moving-mesh cosmology code AREPO.
*In computational physics, Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate profiles of an object with Shadowgraph and proton radiography in High energy density physics.

=== Health ===
*In medical diagnosis, models of muscle tissue, based on Voronoi diagrams, can be used to detect neuromuscular diseases. 
*In epidemiology, Voronoi diagrams can be used to correlate sources of infections in epidemics. One of the early applications of Voronoi diagrams was implemented by John Snow to study the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak in Soho, England. He showed the correlation between residential areas on the map of Central London whose residents had been using a specific water pump, and the areas with the most deaths due to the outbreak.

=== Engineering ===
*In polymer physics, Voronoi diagrams can be used to represent free volumes of polymers.
*In materials science, polycrystalline microstructures in metallic alloys are commonly represented using Voronoi tessellations.
*In island growth, the Voronoi diagram is used to estimate the growth rate of individual islands.
*In solid-state physics, the Wigner-Seitz cell is the Voronoi tessellation of a solid, and the Brillouin zone is the Voronoi tessellation of reciprocal (wavenumber) space of crystals which have the symmetry of a space group.
*In aviation, Voronoi diagrams are superimposed on oceanic plotting charts to identify the nearest airfield for in-flight diversion (see ETOPS), as an aircraft progresses through its flight plan.
*In architecture, Voronoi patterns were the basis for the winning entry for the redevelopment of The Arts Centre Gold Coast.
*In urban planning, Voronoi diagrams can be used to evaluate the Freight Loading Zone system.
*In mining, Voronoi polygons are used to estimate the reserves of valuable materials, minerals, or other resources. Exploratory drillholes are used as the set of points in the Voronoi polygons.
*In surface metrology, Voronoi tessellation can be used for surface roughness modeling.
*In robotics, some of the control strategies and path planning algorithms of multi-robot systems are based on the Voronoi partitioning of the environment.

=== Mathematics ===
*A point location data structure can be built on top of the Voronoi diagram in order to answer nearest neighbor queries, where one wants to find the object that is closest to a given query point. Nearest neighbor queries have numerous applications. For example, one might want to find the nearest hospital or the most similar object in a database. A large application is vector quantization, commonly used in data compression. 
*In geometry, Voronoi diagrams can be used to find the largest empty circle amid a set of points, and in an enclosing polygon; e.g. to build a new supermarket as far as possible from all the existing ones, lying in a certain city.
*Voronoi diagrams together with farthest-point Voronoi diagrams are used for efficient algorithms to compute the roundness of a set of points. The Voronoi approach is also put to use in the evaluation of circularity/roundness while assessing the dataset from a coordinate-measuring machine.
*Zeroes of iterated derivatives of a rational function on the complex plane accumulate on the edges of the Voronoi diagam of the set of the poles (Pólya&#x27;s shires theorem).

=== Informatics ===
*In networking, Voronoi diagrams can be used in derivations of the capacity of a wireless network.
*In computer graphics, Voronoi diagrams are used to calculate 3D shattering / fracturing geometry patterns. It is also used to procedurally generate organic or lava-looking textures.
* In autonomous robot navigation, Voronoi diagrams are used to find clear routes. If the points are obstacles, then the edges of the graph will be the routes furthest from obstacles (and theoretically any collisions).
*In machine learning, Voronoi diagrams are used to do 1-NN classifications.
*In global scene reconstruction, including with random sensor sites and unsteady wake flow, geophysical data, and 3D turbulence data, Voronoi tesselations are used with deep learning.
*In user interface development, Voronoi patterns can be used to compute the best hover state for a given point.

==Algorithms==
Several efficient algorithms are known for constructing Voronoi diagrams, either directly (as the diagram itself) or indirectly by starting with a Delaunay triangulation and then obtaining its dual.
Direct algorithms include Fortune&#x27;s algorithm, an O(&quot;n&quot; log(&quot;n&quot;)) algorithm for generating a Voronoi diagram from a set of points in a plane.
Bowyer–Watson algorithm, an O(&quot;n&quot; log(&quot;n&quot;)) to O(&quot;n&quot;2) algorithm for generating a Delaunay triangulation in any number of dimensions, can be used in an indirect algorithm for the Voronoi diagram. The Jump Flooding Algorithm can generate approximate Voronoi diagrams in constant time and is suited for use on commodity graphics hardware.

Lloyd&#x27;s algorithm and its generalization via the Linde–Buzo–Gray algorithm (aka k-means clustering) use the construction of Voronoi diagrams as a subroutine.
These methods alternate between steps in which one constructs the Voronoi diagram for a set of seed points, and steps in which the seed points are moved to new locations that are more central within their cells. These methods can be used in spaces of arbitrary dimension to iteratively converge towards a specialized form of the Voronoi diagram, called a Centroidal Voronoi tessellation, where the sites have been moved to points that are also the geometric centers of their cells.

== Voronoi in 3D ==
Voronoi meshes can also be generated in 3D.

<text>Jason Gould (; May 27, 1836 – December 2, 1892) was an American railroad magnate and financial speculator who founded the Gould business dynasty. He is generally identified as one of the robber barons of the Gilded Age. His sharp and often unscrupulous business practices made him one of the wealthiest men of the late nineteenth century. Gould was an unpopular figure during his life and remains controversial.

==Early life and education==
Gould was born in Roxbury, New York, to Mary More (1798–1841) and John Burr Gould (1792–1866). His maternal grandfather, Alexander T. More, was a businessman, and his great-grandfather, John More, was a Scottish immigrant who founded the town of Moresville, New York. Gould, however, grew up in poverty and had to work at his family&#x27;s small dairy farm. Gould studied at the Hobart Academy in Hobart, New York, paying his way by bookkeeping. As a young boy, he decided that he wanted nothing to do with farming, his father&#x27;s occupation, so his father dropped him off at a nearby school with fifty cents and a sack of clothes.

==Early career==
Gould&#x27;s school principal was credited with getting him a job as a bookkeeper for a blacksmith. A year later, the blacksmith offered Gould a half-interest in the blacksmith shop, which he sold to his father during the early part of 1854. Gould devoted himself to private study, emphasizing surveying and mathematics. In 1854, he surveyed and created maps of the Ulster County, New York, area. In 1856, he published &quot;History of Delaware County, and Border Wars of New York,&quot; which he had spent several years writing. While engaged in surveying, he started a side activity financing operators making wood ash, which is used with tannin in leather making. 

In 1856, Gould entered a partnership with Zadock Pratt to create a tanning business in Pennsylvania, in an area that was later named Gouldsboro. He eventually bought out Pratt, who retired. In 1856, Gould entered a partnership with Charles Mortimer Leupp, a son-in-law of Gideon Lee and one of the leading leather merchants in the United States. The partnership was successful, until the Panic of 1857. Leupp lost all his money in that financial crisis, but Gould took advantage of the depreciation in property value and bought up former partnership properties.

Gould also started an ice harvesting industry on the large Gouldsboro Lake. In the winter, ice was harvested and stored in large ice houses on the lakeside. He had a railroad line installed next to the lake and he supplied New York City with ice during the summer months.

The Gouldsboro Tannery became a disputed property after Leupp&#x27;s death. Leupp&#x27;s brother-in-law, David W. Lee, was also a partner in Leupp and Gould, and he took armed control of the tannery. He believed that Gould had cheated the Leupp and Lee families during the collapse of the business. Gould eventually took physical possession, but he was later forced to sell his shares in the company to Lee&#x27;s brother.

==Railroad investing==
In 1859, Gould began speculative investing by buying stock in small railways. His father-in-law, Daniel S. Miller, introduced him to the railroad industry by suggesting that Gould help him save his investment in the Rutland and Washington Railroad, during the Panic of 1857. Gould purchased stock for 10 cents on the dollar, which left him in control of the company. He engaged in more speculation on railroad stocks in New York City throughout the Civil War, and he was appointed manager of the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad in 1863.

The Erie Railroad encountered financial troubles in the 1850s, despite receiving loans from financiers Cornelius Vanderbilt and Daniel Drew. It entered receivership in 1859 and was reorganized as the Erie Railway. Gould, Drew, and James Fisk engaged in stock manipulations, known as the Erie War, and Drew, Fisk, and Vanderbilt lost control of the Erie in the summer of 1868, while Gould became its president.

==Tammany Hall==
During the same period, Gould and Fisk became involved with Tammany Hall, the Democratic Party political machine that largely ran New York City at the time. They made its &quot;boss&quot;, notorious William M. &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed, a director of the Erie Railroad, and Tweed arranged favorable legislation. In 1869, Tweed and Gould became the subjects of critical political cartoons by Thomas Nast. Gould was the chief bondsman in October 1871 when Tweed was held on $1 million bail. Tweed was eventually convicted of corruption and died in jail.

==Black Friday==

Due to the struggle to keep Cornelius Vanderbilt from taking over their interests in railroad, Gould and James Fisk engaged in financial manipulations. In August 1869, Gould and Fisk conspired to begin to buy gold in an attempt to illegally corner the market. Gould used contacts with President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, to influence the president and his Secretary General, Horace Porter. These speculations culminated in the financial panic of Black Friday on September 24, 1869, when the greenback (cash) premium over face value of a gold double eagle fell from 62 percent to 35 percent. Gould made a small profit from that operation by hedging against his own attempted corner as it was about to collapse, but lost it in subsequent lawsuits. The gold corner established Gould&#x27;s reputation in the press as an all-powerful figure who could drive the market up and down at will. Favored by Tweed Ring judges, the conspiratorial partners escaped prosecution, but the months of economic turmoil that rocked the nation following the failed corner proved ruinous to farmers and bankrupted some of the most venerable financial institutions on Wall Street.

==More railroads==
===Erie Railroad===
In 1873, Gould attempted to take control of the Erie Railroad by recruiting foreign investments from Lord Gordon-Gordon, supposedly a cousin of the wealthy Campbell clan, who was buying land for immigrants. He bribed Gordon-Gordon with a million dollars in stock, but Gordon-Gordon was an impostor and cashed the stock immediately. Gould sued him and the case went to trial in March 1873. In court, Gordon-Gordon gave the names of the Europeans whom he claimed to represent, and was granted bail while the references were checked. He immediately fled to Canada, where he convinced authorities that the charges were false.

Having failed to convince Canadian authorities to hand over Gordon-Gordon, Gould attempted to kidnap him, with the help of his associates, and future members of Congress, Loren Fletcher, John Gilfillan, and Eugene McLanahan Wilson. The group did capture Gordon-Gordon, but they were stopped and arrested by the North-West Mounted Police before they could return to the US. Canadian authorities put them in prison and refused them bail, which led to an international dispute between the United States and Canada. When he learned that they had been denied bail, Governor Horace Austin of Minnesota demanded their return, and he put the local militia on full readiness. Thousands of Minnesotans volunteered for an invasion of Canada. After negotiations, the Canadian authorities released the men on bail. Gordon-Gordon was eventually ordered to be deported, but committed suicide before the order could be carried out.

===Western railroads===
After being forced out of the Erie Railroad, Gould started to build up a system of railroads in the Midwest and West. He took control of the Union Pacific in 1873, after its stock had been depressed by the Panic of 1873, and he built a viable railroad that depended on shipments from farmers and ranchers. He immersed himself in every operational and financial detail of the Union Pacific system, building an encyclopedic knowledge of the network and acting decisively to shape its destiny. Biographer Maury Klein states that &quot;he revised its financial structure, waged its competitive struggles, captained its political battles, revamped its administration, formulated its rate policies, and promoted the development of resources along its lines.&quot;

By 1879, Gould had gained control of two important Western railroads, including the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Denver and Rio Grande Railway. He controlled of railway, about one-ninth of the rail network in the United States at that time. He obtained a controlling interest in the Western Union telegraph company and, after 1881, in the elevated railways in New York City, and he had a controlling interest in 15 percent of the country&#x27;s railway tracks by 1882. The railroads were making profits and could set their own rates, so his wealth increased dramatically. Gould withdrew from management of the Union Pacific in 1883, amid political controversy over its debts to the federal government, but he realized a large profit for himself. 

In 1889, he organized the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis, which acquired a bottleneck in east–west railroad traffic at St. Louis but, after Gould died, the government brought an antitrust suit to eliminate the bottleneck control.

==Criticism and appraisal==
Gould was extensively criticized during his lifetime, on the basis that he was a trader rather than a builder of businesses, and of being unscrupulous, although more recent appraisal has suggested that his business ethics were not unusual for the time.

Anarcho-capitalist economist Murray Rothbard claimed that Gould&#x27;s business practices were unfairly maligned, because he was supposedly one of the only railroad financiers who consistently undermined the railroad cartels&#x27; proposed rate fixing by starting new railroad lines, thus driving rates down for consumers.

==Personal life==

Gould was a member of West Presbyterian Church at 31 West 42nd Street. It later merged with Park Presbyterian to form West-Park Presbyterian.

He married Helen Day Miller (1838–1889) in 1863 and they had six children. Together with his son George, Gould was a founding member of American Yacht Club. He owned the steam yacht Atalanta (1883). In 1880, he purchased the Gothic Revival mansion Lyndhurst (sometimes spelled &quot;Lindhurst&quot;), to use as a country house.

On December 2, 1892, Gould died of tuberculosis, then referred to as consumption, and was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx, New York. For tax purposes, his fortune was conservatively estimated at $72 million (equivalent to $ in 2025), which he willed in its entirety to his family.

At the time of his death, Gould was a benefactor in the reconstruction of the Reformed Church of Roxbury, New York, now known as the Jay Gould Memorial Reformed Church. It is located within the Main Street Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The family mausoleum was designed by Francis O&#x27;Hara.

<text>The Pennsylvania Dutch (), also referred to as Pennsylvania Germans, are an ethnic group in Pennsylvania (U.S.), Ontario (Canada) and other regions of the United States and Canada, most predominantly in the US Mid-Atlantic region. They largely originate from the Palatinate region of Germany, and settled in Pennsylvania during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. While most were from the Palatinate region of Germany, a lesser number were from other German-speaking areas of Germany and Europe, including Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, Saxony, and Rhineland in Germany, Switzerland, and the Alsace–Lorraine region of France.

The Pennsylvania Dutch are either monolingual English speakers or bilingual speakers of both English and the Pennsylvania Dutch language, which is also commonly referred to as Pennsylvania German. Linguistically it consists of a mix of German dialects which have been significantly influenced by English, primarily in terms of vocabulary. Based on dialect features, Pennsylvania Dutch can be classified as a variety of Rhine Franconian, with the Palatine German dialects being most closely related.

Geographically, Pennsylvania Dutch are largely found in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country and Ohio Amish Country. The main division among Pennsylvania Dutch is that between sectarians (those belonging to the Old Order Mennonite, Amish or related groups) and nonsectarians, sometimes colloquially referred to as ″Church Dutch″ or ″Fancy Dutch″.
Notable Americans of Pennsylvania Dutch descent include Henry J. Heinz, founder of the Heinz food conglomerate, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the family of businessman Elon Musk.

==Autonym==
Differing explanations exist on why the Pennsylvania Dutch are referred to as &quot;Dutch&quot;, which typically refers to the inhabitants of the Netherlands or the Dutch language, which is only distantly related to Pennsylvania German.

Several authors and etymological publications consider the word &quot;Dutch&quot; in &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot;, which in medieval times could also be used to refer to speakers of various German dialects, to be an archaism specific to 19th-century American English, particularly in its colloquial form. An alternative interpretation commonly found among laypeople and scholars alike is that the &quot;Dutch&quot; in &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot; is an anglicization or &quot;corruption&quot; (folk-etymological re-interpretation) of the Pennsylvania German autonym &quot;deitsch&quot;, which in the Pennsylvania German language refers to the Pennsylvania Dutch or Germans in general. However, some authors have described this hypothesis as a misconception.

The migration of the Pennsylvania Dutch to the United States predates the emergence of a distinct German national identity, which did not form until the late 18th century. The formation of the German Empire in 1871 resulted in a semantic shift, in which &quot;deutsch&quot; was no longer principally a linguistic and cultural term, but was increasingly used to describe all things related to Germany and its inhabitants. This development did not go unnoticed among the Pennsylvania Dutch who, in the 19th and early 20th century, referred to themselves as &quot;Deitsche&quot;, while calling newer German immigrants &quot;Deitschlenner&quot; &#x27;Germany-ans&#x27;.

==Geographic distribution==
The Pennsylvania Dutch live primarily in the Delaware Valley and in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country, a large area that includes South Central Pennsylvania, in the area stretching in an arc from Bethlehem and Allentown in the Lehigh Valley westward through Reading, Lebanon, and Lancaster to York and Chambersburg. Smaller enclaves include Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking areas in New York, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia, North Carolina, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Virginia, and the Canadian province of Ontario.

==History==
===Immigration to America===
The Pennsylvania Dutch, primarily German-speaking immigrants from Germany (particularly the Palatinate region), Switzerland, and Alsace, moved to the USA seeking better opportunities and a safer, more tolerant environment. Many, including Amish and Mennonites, faced religious persecution in Europe. Pennsylvania, established by William Penn as a haven for religious minorities, promised the religious freedom they sought. Economic hardship, marked by war, famine, and limited land access in 17th and 18th century Germany, pushed many to seek a better life in the New World, which offered abundant land and resources. 

Europe’s, and especially Germany&#x27;s, political instability, with frequent wars like the devastating Thirty Years&#x27; War, contrasted with the relatively stable environment of the American colonies. The availability of fertile land was a significant draw for the immigrants, who were mainly farmers and craftsmen, for whom the chance to own and cultivate their own farms was highly appealing. Positive reports from early settlers as well as active recruitment by William Penn encouraged friends and family to join them, fostering tightly-knit communities.
About three fourths of all Germans in Pennsylvania were subject to several years of indentured servitude contracts. These indentured servants, known as redemptioners, were made to work on plantations or perform other work to pay off the costs of the sponsor or shipping company which had advanced the cost of their transatlantic voyage. In 1764, the German Society of Pennsylvania was founded to protect the German redemptioners.

The bulk of German migration to the American colonies began in 1683 but concentrated on the first half of the 18th century. Overall, the historian Marianne Wokeck estimates that just under 81,000 German-speakers entered the port of Philadelphia between 1683 and 1775, with two thirds of the immigrants arriving before 1755 of whom the majority (ca. 35,000) arrived in the five year period between 1749 and 1754. In 1790, ethnic Germans comprised 38% of the population of Pennsylvania, or approximately 165,000 people. Of these, over half resided in the counties of Berks, Lancaster, Northampton and York.

Anglo-Americans held much anti-Palatine sentiment in the Pennsylvania Colony. Below is a quotation of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s complaints about the Palatine refugees in his work &quot;Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind (1751)&quot;:
The Germans who immigrated to the United States saw themselves as related though distinct from later (post-1830) waves of German-speaking immigrants. The Pennsylvania Dutch referred to themselves as &quot;Deitsche&quot; and would refer to Germans who arrived after the period of almost non-existent emigration between 1760 and 1830 from the German lands as &quot;Deitschlenner&quot;, literally &quot;Germany-ers&quot;, compare .

===Pennsylvania Dutch during the American Revolutionary War===
The Pennsylvania Dutch composed nearly half of the population of the Province of Pennsylvania. The Fancy Dutch population generally supported the Patriot cause in the American Revolution; the nonviolent Plain Dutch minority did not fight in the war. Heinrich Miller of the Holy Roman Principality of Waldeck (1702-1782), was a journalist and printer based in Philadelphia, and published an early German translation of the &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; (1776) in his newspaper &quot;Philadelphische Staatsbote&quot;. Miller, having Swiss ancestry, often wrote about Swiss history and myth, such as the William Tell legend, to provide a context for patriot support in the conflict with Britain.

Frederick Muhlenberg (1750–1801), a Lutheran pastor, became a major patriot and politician, rising to be elected as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
The Pennsylvania Dutch contribution to the war effort was notable:


Many Hessian prisoners, German mercenaries fighting for the British, were held in camps at the interior city of Lancaster, home to a large German community known as the Pennsylvania Dutch. Hessian prisoners were subsequently treated well, with some volunteering for extra work assignments, helping to replace local men serving in the Continental Army. Due to shared German heritage and abundance of land, many Hessian soldiers stayed and settled in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country after the war&#x27;s end.

====Pennsylvania Dutch Provost Corps====
Pennsylvania Dutch were recruited for the American Provost corps under Captain Bartholomew von Heer, a Prussian who had served in a similar unit in Europe before immigrating to Reading, Pennsylvania, prior to the war.

During the Revolutionary War the &quot;Marechaussee&quot; Corps were utilized in a variety of ways, including intelligence gathering, route security, enemy prisoner of war operations, and even combat during the Battle of Springfield. The Marechausee also provided security for Washington&#x27;s headquarters during the Battle of Yorktown, acted as his security detail, and was one of the last units deactivated after the Revolutionary War. The Marechaussee Corps was often not well received by the Continental Army, due in part to their defined duties but also due to the fact that some members of the corps spoke little or no English. Six of the provosts had even been Hessian prisoners of war prior to their recruitment. Because the provost corps completed many of the same functions as the modern U.S. Military Police Corps, it is considered a predecessor of the current United States Military Police Regiment.

===Pennsylvania Dutch during the Civil War===
Nearly all of the regiments from Pennsylvania that fought in the American Civil War had German-speaking or Pennsylvania Dutch-speaking members on their rosters, the majority of whom were Fancy Dutch.

Some regiments like the 153rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry were entirely composed of Pennsylvania Dutch soldiers. The 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment also had a high percentage of German immigrants and Pennsylvania-born men of German heritage on its rosters; the regiment&#x27;s K Company was formed with the intent of it being an &quot;all-German company.&quot;

Pennsylvania Dutch companies sometimes mixed with English-speaking companies. (The Pennsylvania Dutch had the habit of labeling anyone who did not speak Pennsylvania Dutch &quot;English.&quot;) Many of the Pennsylvania Dutch soldiers who fought in the Civil War were recruited and trained at Camp Curtin, Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania Dutch regiments composed a large portion of the Federal Forces who fought in the Battle of Gettysburg at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the bloodiest battle of the Civil War.

==Decline of the Pennsylvania Dutch==

Immediately after the Civil War, the federal government took steps to replace Pennsylvania German schools with English-only schools. The Pennsylvania Dutch fought to retain German as an official language in Pennsylvania to little success.

Literary German disappeared from Pennsylvania Dutch life little by little, starting with schools, and then to churches and newspapers. Pennsylvania Dutch became mainly a spoken language, and as education came to only be provided in English, many Pennsylvania Dutch became bilingual.

===Anti-German sentiment and Americanization===
The next blow to Pennsylvania Dutch came during World War I and World War II. Prior to the wars, Pennsylvania Dutch was an urban language spoken openly in the streets of towns such as Allentown, Reading, Lancaster and York; afterwards, it became relegated only to rural areas.

There was rampant social &amp; employment discrimination for anyone suspected of being German. Meritt G. Yorgey, a Pennsylvania Dutch descendant who grew up during the height of anti-German sentiment, remembers the instructions of his father: &quot;Don&#x27;t ever call yourself &quot;Dutch&quot; or &quot;Pennsylvania German.&quot; You&#x27;re just American.&quot;

Many Pennsylvanians of German heritage have chosen to assimilate into Anglo-American culture, except for a significant number of Amish and Mennonite plain people who have chosen to remain insular, which has added to the modern misconception that &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Amish.&quot;

===Pennsylvania Dutch during World War I===
Palatine Dutch of New York in the 27th Infantry Division broke through the Hindenburg Line in 1918.

===Interwar period===
Before World War II, the Nazi Party sought to gain the loyalty of the German-American community, and established pro-Nazi German-American Bunden, emphasizing German-American immigrant ties to the &quot;Fatherland&quot;. The Nazi propaganda effort failed in the Pennsylvania Dutch community, as the Pennsylvania Dutch felt no sense of loyalty to Germany.

===Pennsylvania Dutch during World War II===

During World War II, a platoon of Pennsylvania Dutch soldiers on patrol in Germany was once spared from being machine-gunned by Nazi soldiers who listened to them approaching. The Germans heard them speaking Pennsylvania Dutch amongst each other and assumed that they were natives of the Palatinate.

==Canadian Pennsylvania Dutch==

An early group, mainly from the Roxborough-Germantown area of Pennsylvania, emigrated to then colonial Nova Scotia in 1766 and founded the Township of Monckton, site of present-day Moncton, New Brunswick. The extensive Steeves clan descends from this group.

After the American Revolution, John Graves Simcoe, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, invited Americans, including Mennonites and German Baptist Brethren, to settle in British North American territory and offered tracts of land to immigrant groups. This resulted in communities of Pennsylvania Dutch speakers emigrating to Canada, many to the area called the German Company Tract, a subset of land within the Haldimand Tract, in the Township of Waterloo, which later became Waterloo County, Ontario. Some still live in the area around Markham, Ontario, and particularly in the northern areas of the current Waterloo Region. Some members of the two communities formed the Markham-Waterloo Mennonite Conference. Today, the Pennsylvania Dutch language is mostly spoken by Old Order Mennonites.

From 1800 to the 1830s, some Mennonites in Upstate New York and Pennsylvania moved north to Canada, primarily to the area that would become Cambridge, Kitchener/Waterloo and St. Jacobs/Elmira in Waterloo County, Ontario, plus the Listowel area adjacent to the northwest. Settlement started in 1800 by Joseph Schoerg and Samuel Betzner, Jr. (brothers-in-law), Mennonites, from Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Other settlers followed mostly from Pennsylvania typically by Conestoga wagons. Many of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania after November 1803 bought land in a sixty thousand-acre section established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County Pennsylvania, called the German Company Lands.

Fewer of the Pennsylvania Dutch settled in what would later become the Greater Toronto Area in areas that would later be the towns of Altona, Ontario, Pickering, Ontario, and especially Markham Village, Ontario, and Stouffville, Ontario. Peter Reesor and brother-in-law Abraham Stouffer were higher profile settlers in Markham and Stouffville.

William Berczy, a German entrepreneur and artist, had settled in upstate New York and in May 1794, he was able to obtain sixty-four acres in Markham Township, near the current city of Toronto. Berczy arrived with approximately one hundred and ninety German families from Pennsylvania and settled here. Others later moved to other locations in the general area, including a hamlet they founded, German Mills, Ontario, named for its grist mill; that community is now called Thornhill, Ontario, in the township that is now part of York Region.

===Canadian Black Mennonites===
In Canada, an 1851 census shows many Black people and Mennonites lived near each other in a number of places and exchanged labor; the Dutch would also hire Black laborers. There were also accounts of Black families providing childcare assistance for their Pennsylvania Dutch neighbors. These Pennsylvania Dutch were usually Plain Dutch Mennonites or Fancy Dutch Lutherans. The Black-Mennonite relationship in Canada soon evolved to the level of church membership.

==Society== 


Pennsylvania Dutch society can be divided into two main groups: the sectarian &quot;Plain Dutch&quot; and the nonsectarian &quot;Church Dutch&quot; also known as &quot;Fancy Dutch&quot;. These classifications highlight differences in religious practices, lifestyle, and degrees of assimilation into broader American society.

The Plain Dutch consist of Anabaptist sects, including the Amish, Mennonites, and Brethren. They are known for their conservative, simple lifestyle, characterized by plain dress and limited use of modern technology. These communities typically reside in rural areas, maintaining traditional farming practices and close-knit communal living. Pennsylvania Dutch (a dialect of German) is widely spoken among them, both in daily life and religious settings. The Plain Dutch adhere strictly to their religious and community norms, emphasizing a strong cultural and religious identity with minimal integration into mainstream American culture.

The Church Dutch, in contrast, belong to more mainstream Protestant denominations such as Lutheran, Reformed, United Church of Christ, and some Methodist and Baptist congregations. This group is more integrated into broader American society and is more likely to adopt modern conveniences and technologies. While they may still preserve some Pennsylvania Dutch traditions and language, English is predominantly used in daily life and religious practices. The Church Dutch exhibit a higher degree of assimilation into American culture, while still retaining elements of their Pennsylvania Dutch heritage.

The primary differences between these groups lie in their religious practices, lifestyle, language use, and cultural integration. The Plain Dutch are more conservative and focused on maintaining their distinct cultural identity, whereas the Church Dutch are more assimilated and open to modern influences. In time the Fancy Dutch came to control much of the best agricultural lands, ran many newspapers and maintained their German-inspired architecture when founding new towns in Pennsylvania.

There is little evidence specifically of Black Pennsylvania Dutch speakers during the early 19th century; following the Civil War, some Black Southerners who had moved to Pennsylvania developed close ties with the Pennsylvania Dutch community, adopting the language and assimilating into the culture. An 1892 article in &quot;The New York Sun&quot; noted a community of &quot;Pennsylvania German Negroes&quot; in Lebanon County for whom German was their first language.

Today Pennsylvania Dutch culture is still prevalent in some parts of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Dutch speak English, with some being bilingual in English and Pennsylvania Dutch. They share cultural similarities with the Mennonites in the same area. Pennsylvania Dutch English retains some German grammar and literally translated vocabulary, some phrases include &quot;outen or out&#x27;n the lights&quot; (German: &#x27;) meaning &quot;turn off the lights&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s gonna make wet&quot; (German: &#x27;) meaning &quot;it&#x27;s going to rain&quot;, and &quot;it&#x27;s all&quot; (German: &#x27;) meaning &quot;it&#x27;s all gone&quot;. They also sometimes leave out the verb in phrases turning &quot;the trash needs to go out&quot; in to &quot;the trash needs out&quot; (German: &#x27;), in alignment with German grammar.

===Cuisine===

The Pennsylvania Dutch have some foods that are uncommon outside of places where they live. Some of these include shoo-fly pie, funnel cake, pepper cabbage, filling and jello salads such as strawberry pretzel salad.

===Religion===
The Pennsylvania Dutch maintain numerous religious affiliations; the greatest number are Lutheran or German Reformed with a lesser number of Anabaptists, including Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren. The Anabaptist groups espoused a simple lifestyle, and their adherents were known as Plain Dutch; this contrasts with the Fancy Dutch, mostly of the Lutheran, or Evangelical and Reformed churches, who tended to assimilate more easily into the American mainstream. By the late 1700s, other denominations were also represented in smaller numbers.

Among immigrants from the 1600s and 1700s, those known as the Pennsylvania Dutch included Mennonites, Swiss Brethren (also called Mennonites by the locals) and Amish but also Anabaptist-Pietists such as German Baptist Brethren and those who belonged to German Lutheran or German Reformed Church congregations. Other settlers of that era were of the Moravian Church while a few were Seventh Day Baptists. Calvinist Palatines and several other denominations were also represented to a lesser extent.

Over sixty percent of the immigrants who arrived in Pennsylvania from Germany or Switzerland in the 1700s and 1800s were Lutherans and they maintained good relations with those of the German Reformed Church. The two groups founded Franklin College (now Franklin &amp; Marshall College) in 1787.

According to Elizabeth Pardoe, by 1748, the future of the German culture in Pennsylvania was in doubt, and most of the attention focused on German language schools. Lutheran schools in Germantown and Philadelphia thrived, but most outlying congregations had difficulty recruiting students. Furthermore Lutherans were challenged by Moravians who actively recruited Lutherans to their schools. In the 1750s, Benjamin Franklin led a drive for free charity schools for German students, with the proviso that the schools would minimize Germanness. The leading Lutheran school in Philadelphia school had internal political problems in the 1760s, but Pastor Henry Melchior Muhlenberg resolved them. The arrival of John Christopher Kunze from Germany in 1770 gave impetus to the Halle model in America. Kunze began training clergy and teachers in the Halle system. Reverend Heinrich Christian Helmuth arrived in 1779 and called for preaching only in German, while seeking government subsidies. A major issue was the long-term fate of German culture in Pennsylvania, with most solutions focused on schools. Helmuth saw schools as central to the future of the ethnic community. However most Lutheran clergy believed in assimilation and rejected Helmuth&#x27;s call to drop English instruction. Kunze&#x27;s seminary failed, but the first German college in the United States was founded in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1787 as Franklin College; it was later renamed Franklin and Marshall College. The Moravians settled Bethlehem and nearby areas and established schools for Native Americans.

In Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania Dutch Christians and Pennsylvania Dutch Jews have often maintained a special relationship due to their common German language and cultural heritage. Because both Yiddish and the Pennsylvania Dutch language are High German languages, there are strong similarities between the two languages and a limited degree of mutual intelligibility. Historically, Pennsylvania Dutch Christians and Pennsylvania Dutch Jews often had overlapping bonds in German-American business and community life. Due to this historical bond there are several mixed-faith cemeteries in Lehigh County, including Allentown&#x27;s Fairview Cemetery, where German-Americans of both the Jewish and Protestant faiths are buried.

===Language===
Although speakers of Pennsylvania Dutch can be found among both sectarians and nonsectarians, most speakers belong to the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites. Nearly all Amish and Mennonites are naturally bilingual, speaking both Pennsylvania Dutch and English natively. The Pennsylvania Dutch language is based on German dialects which have been significantly influenced by English, primarily in terms of vocabulary. Based on dialect features, Pennsylvania Dutch can be classified as a variety of Rhine Franconian, with the Palatine German dialects being most closely related. The language is both commonly referred to as &quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania German&quot;, with the latter being more common in scholarly publications.

The primary use of Pennsylvania Dutch, both historically and today, has focussed on spoken communication. Although there is a relatively large collection of written texts in the language dating back to the mid-nineteenth century (such as newspaper columns, short stories, poems, plays, and dialogues) their production and reception have been limited to a minority of speakers. The significance of English among today&#x27;s sectarians extends far beyond its use for communication with outsiders for business and other purposes as English is the primary language for active literacy. While Amish and Mennonite sectarians can read the Bible, prayer books, and hymnals in German, most other reading materials are in English. Research has show that nonsectarian speakers of Pennsylvania Dutch have a more pronounced Pennsylvania Dutch accent when speaking English compared to sectarian speakers such as the Old Order Amish or Old Order Mennonites.

In the 20th century, the linguists Albert F. Buffington and Preston A. Barba developed a system for writing Pennsylvania Dutch that was largely based on contemporary German orthography, however this is not in common use. No prescribed norms for writing Pennsylvania Dutch exist and in practice most speakers orientate themselves on both German and English spelling systems.

Due to anti-German sentiment between World War I and World War II, the use of the Pennsylvania Dutch language declined, except among the more insular and tradition-bound Plain people, such as the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites. Many German cultural practices continue in Pennsylvania in the present-day, and German remains the largest ancestry claimed by Pennsylvanians, according to the 2008 census.

<text>Barnstorming was a form of entertainment in which stunt pilots performed tricks individually or in groups that were called flying circuses. Devised to &quot;impress people with the skill of pilots and the sturdiness of planes,&quot; it became popular in the United States during the Roaring Twenties. 

Barnstormers were pilots who flew throughout the country to sell airplane rides and perform stunts. Charles Lindbergh first began flying as a barnstormer. Barnstorming was the first major form of civil aviation in the history of manned flight.

==History==
===Background===
The Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss had early flying exhibition teams, with solo flyers like Lincoln Beachey and Didier Masson also popular before World War I, but barnstorming did not become a formal phenomenon until the 1920s. The first barnstormer, taught to fly by Curtiss in 1909, was one Charles Foster Willard, who is also credited as the first to be shot down in an airplane when an annoyed farmer fired a squirrel gun and broke his propeller.

During World War I, the United States manufactured a significant number of Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; biplanes to train its military aviators, and almost every American airman learned to fly using the plane. After the war the U.S. federal government sold off the surplus material, including the Jennys, for a fraction of their initial value (they had cost the government $5,000 each, but were being sold for as low as $200). This allowed many servicemen who already knew how to fly the JN-4s to purchase their own planes. The similar-looking Standard J-1 biplane was also available.

At the same time, numerous aircraft manufacturing companies sprang up, most failing after building only a handful of planes. Many of these were reliable and even advanced designs which suffered from the failure of the aviation market to expand as expected, and a number of these found their way into the only active markets—mail carrying, barnstorming, and smuggling. Sometimes a plane and its owner would drift between the three activities as opportunity presented.

Combined with the lack of Federal Aviation Regulations at the time, these factors allowed barnstorming to flourish.

===Growth and heyday===
====Flying circuses====
Although barnstormers often worked alone or in very small teams, some also organized large &quot;flying circuses&quot; with multiple planes and stunt people. These acts employed promoters to book shows in towns ahead of time. They were the largest and most organized of all of the barnstorming acts. Well-known circuses included the Five Blackbirds (an African American flying group), the Flying Aces Air Circus, the 13 Black Cats, Mabel Cody’s Flying Circus, the Inman Brothers Flying Circus, and the Marie Meyer Flying Circus. Perhaps the largest and most successful of these was the Gates Flying Circus, which attracted in its heyday tens of thousands to a single show. A &quot;Time&quot; magazine article estimated it staged 2000 air meets in 44 states.

====Women and minorities====
Barnstorming was performed not only by former military men, but also by women, minorities, and minority women. For example, on July 18, 1915, Katherine Stinson became the first woman in the world to perform a loop. Bessie Coleman, an African-American woman, &quot;not only thrilled audiences with her skills as a barnstormer, but she also became a role model for women and African Americans. Her very presence in the air threatened prevailing contemporary stereotypes. She also fought segregation when she could by using her influence as a celebrity.&quot;

===Charles Lindbergh, before his fame===
Charles Lindbergh engaged in barnstorming in his early years, with the Marie Meyer Flying Circus and others, making a marginal living; Errold Bahl hired him as an assistant, and as a promotional stunt, Lindbergh &quot;volunteered to climb out onto the wing and wave to the crowds below,&quot; a performance known as &quot;wing walking.&quot; During a barnstorming tour in Minnesota and Wisconsin in 1923, he made the &quot;decision to pursue further formal instruction with the U.S. Army Air Service.&quot;

===Regulation and decline===
The sensational journalism and economic prosperity that marked the Jazz Age in the United States allowed barnstormers to publicize aviation and eventually contributed to bringing about regulation and control. In 1925, the U.S. government began regulating aviation, when it passed the Contract Air Mail Act, which allowed the U.S. Post Office to hire private airlines to deliver mail with payments made based on the weight of the mail. The following year, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Air Commerce Act, which shifted the management of air routes to a new branch in the Department of Commerce, which was also responsible for &quot;licensing of planes and pilots, establishing safety regulations, and general promotion.&quot;

Barnstorming &quot;seemed to be founded on bravado, with &#x27;one-upmanship&#x27; a major incentive.&quot; By 1927, competition among barnstormers resulted in their performing increasingly dangerous tricks, and a rash of highly publicized accidents led to new safety regulations, which led to the demise of barnstorming. Spurred by a perceived need to protect the public and in response to political pressure by local pilots upset at barnstormers stealing their customers, the federal government enacted laws to regulate a fledgling civil aviation sector.
The laws included safety standards and specifications that were virtually impossible for barnstormers to meet, such as the minimum altitude at which certain tricks could be performed (making it harder for spectators to see what was happening). The military also stopped selling Jennys in the late 1920s. This made it too difficult for barnstormers to make a living. Clyde Pangborn, who was the pilot of the two-man aviation team who were the first to cross the Pacific Ocean nonstop in 1931, ended his barnstorming career in 1931. Some pilots, however, continued to wander the country giving rides as late as fall 1941.

== Performances==
===Planning===
&quot;Barnstorming season&quot; ran from early spring until after the harvest and county fairs in the fall. Most barnstorming shows started with a pilot, or team of pilots flying over a small rural town to attract local attention. They would then land at a local farm (hence the term &quot;barnstorming&quot;) and negotiate for the use of a field as a temporary runway from which to stage an air show and offer airplane rides. After obtaining a base of operation, the pilot or group of aviators would &quot;buzz&quot; the village and drop flyers. In some towns the arrival of a barnstormer or an aerial troupe would lead to a town-wide shutdown as people attended the show.

===Stunts===

Barnstormers performed a variety of stunts, with some specializing as stunt pilots or aerialists. Stunt pilots performed a variety of aerobatic maneuvers, including spins, dives, loop-the-loops and barrel rolls. Meanwhile, aerialists performed feats of wing walking, stunt parachuting, midair plane transfers, or even playing tennis, target shooting, and dancing on the plane&#x27;s wings. Other stunts included nose dives and flying through barns, which sometimes led to pilots crashing their planes.

===Business===
Barnstormers offered plane rides for a small fee. Lindbergh, for example, charged five dollars for a 15-minute ride in his plane. However exciting and glamorous, it was not an easy way to make a steady living. To make ends meet, the barnstormers—including Charles Lindbergh—often had to moonlight as flying instructors, handymen, gas station attendants, etc. Barnstormers often traded plane rides for room and board, both for commercial lodging and in private homes.

===Film and television===
*&quot;The Tarnished Angels&quot; (1957) – melodrama by Douglas Sirk based on the Faulkner novel about barnstorming
*&quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965) – comedy about the &quot;pioneer era&quot; (1903-1914) of air racing and barnstorming in Europe
*&quot;Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies&quot; (1973) – based on a story by Steven Spielberg starring Cliff Robertson as a Jenny pilot who barnstorms with his young son
*&quot;The Great Waldo Pepper&quot; (1975)
*&quot;Nothing by Chance&quot; (1975) – documentary by Hugh Downs about the biplanes that barnstormed across America in the 1920s
*&quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978) – movie by Terrence Mallick in which a barnstorming troupe visits a farm and performs
*&quot;The Gypsy Moths&quot; (1969) – American drama film directed by John Frankenheimer starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, based on the novel of the same name by James William Drought
* The MTV show &quot;Nitro Circus&quot; features Travis Pastrana, Jolene Van Vugt, and Erik Roner wing-walking on a biplane without chutes or harnesses
*&quot; The Fall Guy&quot; (1981-1986)- An action/adventure television series originally airing on ABC. The show was about a stuntman who moonlights as a bounty hunter using his skills as a stuntman to catch the bad guys. A scene from the intro shows of a biplane running through a farm yard before crashing into the side of a barn. This causes the stuntman ‘Colt’ to be thrown out from the crashed biplane. The following scene continues with Colt being thrown into the hay in effect &#x27;hitting the hay&#x27;. To conclude stunt the stuntman covers his head with his hands burying his face into the hay while exploiting his uncompromising yet embarrassing situation he &quot;Hey Hey&quot;s himself to attention in song. Actually this scene in The Fall Guy intro was borrowed from a scene from a movie Singin’ in the Rain. In season 2, episode 18 of The Fall Guy, titled ‘Guess Who’s Coming to Town’, the episode starts out with Colt performing a stunt from a Robert Redford movie The Great Waldo Pepper. As the biplane gains altitude to avoid crashing into the barn, it wasn’t high enough to avoid Colt from doing the same. Colt crashes through the barn roof and winds up falling into the hay (in effect hitting the hay).

===Video games===
* In 1982, Activision produced a &quot;Barnstorming&quot; game cartridge for the Atari 2600
* In &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 2&quot;, the &quot;Barnstorming Roller Coaster&quot; has coaster cars that are replica biplanes

* In &quot;Kentucky Route Zero&quot;, the small town surrounding 5 dogwood drive was established and lived in by a troupe of barnstormers.
* In &quot;Indigo Park&quot;, the character Mollie Macaw refers to her habit of crashing into barns as barnstorming. A later song associated with the character is titled &quot;BARNSTORMING&quot;.

===Music===
*&quot;The Immelmann Turn,&quot; by Al Stewart, a song set in the 1920s barnstorming era which refers to an aerobatic maneuver of the same name
*&quot;Barn Storming,&quot; by State Radio

<text>The history of aviation spans over two millennia, from the earliest innovations like kites and attempts at tower jumping to supersonic and hypersonic flight in powered, heavier-than-air jet aircraft. Kite flying in China, dating back several hundred years BC, is considered the earliest example of man-made flight. In the 15th-century Leonardo da Vinci created several flying machine designs incorporating aeronautical concepts, but they were unworkable due to the limitations of contemporary knowledge.

In the late 18th century, the Montgolfier brothers invented the hot-air balloon which soon led to manned flights. At almost the same time, the discovery of hydrogen gas led to the invention of the hydrogen balloon. Various theories in mechanics by physicists during the same period, such as fluid dynamics and Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, led to the development of modern aerodynamics; most notably by Sir George Cayley. Balloons, both free-flying and tethered, began to be used for military purposes from the end of the 18th century, with France establishing balloon companies during the French Revolution.

In the 19th century, especially the second half, experiments with gliders provided the basis for learning the dynamics of winged aircraft; most notably by Cayley, Otto Lilienthal, and Octave Chanute. By the early 20th century, advances in engine technology and aerodynamics made controlled, powered, manned heavier-than-air flight possible for the first time. In 1903, following their pioneering research and experiments with wing design and aircraft control, the Wright brothers successfully incorporated all of the required elements to create and fly the first aeroplane. The basic configuration with its characteristic cruciform tail was established by 1909, followed by rapid design and performance improvements aided by the development of more powerful engines.

The first vessels of the air were the rigid steerable balloons pioneered by Ferdinand von Zeppelin that became synonymous with airships and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large flying boats became popular for trans-oceanic routes. After World War II, the flying boats were in turn replaced by airplanes operating from land, made far more capable first by improved propeller engines, then by jet engines, which revolutionized both civilian air travel and military aviation.

In the latter half of the 20th century, the development of digital electronics led to major advances in flight instrumentation and &quot;fly-by-wire&quot; systems. The 21st century has seen the widespread use of pilotless drones for military, commercial, and recreational purposes. With computerized controls, inherently unstable aircraft designs, such as flying wings, have also become practical.

==Etymology==
The term aviation, is a noun of action from the stem of Latin avis &quot;bird&quot; with the suffix -ation meaning action or progress. It was coined in 1863 by French pioneer Guillaume Joseph Gabriel de La Landelle (1812–1886) in &quot;Aviation ou Navigation aérienne sans ballons&quot;.

==Primitive beginnings==


===Tower jumping===

Since ancient times, there have been stories of men strapping birdlike wings, stiffened cloaks, or other devices to themselves and attempting to fly, typically by jumping off a tower. The Greek legends of Daedalus and Icarus are some of the earliest known. Others originated in ancient Asia and the European Middle Ages. During this early period, the concepts of lift, stability, and control were not well understood, and most attempts resulted in serious injuries or death.

The Andalusian scientist Abbas ibn Firnas (810–887 AD) attempted to fly in Córdoba, Spain, by covering his body with vulture feathers and attached two wings to his arms. The 17th-century Algerian historian Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari, quoting a poem by Muhammad I of Córdoba&#x27;s 9th-century court poet Mu&#x27;min ibn Said, recounts that Firnas flew some distance before landing with some injuries, attributed to his lacking a tail (as birds use them to land). In the 12th century, William of Malmesbury wrote that Eilmer of Malmesbury, an 11th-century Benedictine monk, attached wings to his hands and feet and flew a short distance, but broke both legs while landing, also having neglected to make himself a tail.

Many others made well-documented jumps in the following centuries. As late as 1811, Albrecht Berblinger constructed an ornithopter and jumped into the Danube at Ulm.

===Kites===

The kite may have been the first form of man-made heavier-than-air aircraft. It was invented in China possibly as far back as the 5th century BC. by Mozi (Mo Di) and Lu Ban (Gongshu Ban). Evidence to support this finding stands with materials commonly found and ideal for kite building located in China.  These are materials such as &quot;silk fabric for sail material, fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line, and resilient bamboo for…framework&quot; The reason these materials were so perfect for building kites is largely due to the structure of the materials themselves. Bamboo being a strong, hollow material, largely resembled the hollow bones in birds, which allow for less weight, making flight easier. Some kites were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical sounds while flying. Ancient and mediaeval Chinese sources describe kites being used to measure distances, test the wind, lift men, signal, and communicate and send messages. Later designs often depicted images of flying insects, birds, and other beasts, both real and mythical.

Kites spread from China around the world. After being introduced into the rest of Asia, the kite further evolved into the fighter kite, which has an abrasive line used to cut down other kites. The most notable fighter kite designs originated in India and Japan

====Man-lifting kites====
Man-lifting kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient China for civil and military purposes and sometimes enforced as a punishment. An early recorded flight was that of the prisoner Yuan Huangtou, a Chinese prince, in the 6th century AD. Stories of man-lifting kites can be found in Japan, following the introduction of the kite from China around the seventh century AD. For a period, there was a Japanese law against man-carrying kites.

=== Rotor wings ===
The use of a rotor for vertical flight has existed since 400 BC in the form of the bamboo-copter, an ancient Chinese toy. The similar &quot;moulinet à noix&quot; (rotor on a nut) appeared in Europe in the 14th century AD.

===Hot air balloons===
Since ancient times, the Chinese understood that hot air rises and applied the principle to a type of small hot air balloon called a sky lantern. A sky lantern consists of a paper balloon under or just inside which a small lamp is placed. Sky lanterns are traditionally launched for recreation and during festivals. According to Joseph Needham, such lanterns were found in China since the 3rd century BC. Their military use is attributed to the general Zhuge Liang (180–234 AD), who is said to have used them to scare the enemy troops.

There is evidence that the Chinese also &quot;solved the problem of aerial navigation&quot; using balloons, hundreds of years before the 18th century.

=== Renaissance ===

Eventually, some investigators began to discover and define some of the basics of rational aircraft design. Most notable of these was Leonardo da Vinci, although his work remained unknown until 1797, and so had no influence on developments over the next three hundred years. While his designs are rational, they are not scientific. He particularly underestimated the amount of power that would be needed to propel a flying object, basing his designs on the flapping wings of a bird rather than an engine-powered propeller.

Leonardo studied bird and bat flight, claiming the superiority of the latter owing to its unperforated wing. He analyzed these and anticipated many principles of aerodynamics. He understood that &quot;An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object.&quot; Isaac Newton later defined this as the third law of motion in 1687.

From the last years of the 15th century until 1505, Leonardo wrote about and sketched many designs for flying machines and mechanisms, including ornithopters, fixed-wing gliders, rotorcraft (perhaps inspired by whirligig toys), parachutes (in the form of a wooden-framed pyramidal tent) and a wind speed gauge. His early designs were man-powered and included ornithopters and rotorcraft; however, he came to realise the impracticality of this and later turned to controlled gliding flight, also sketching some designs powered by a spring.

In an essay titled &quot;Sul volo&quot; (&quot;On flight&quot;), Leonardo describes a flying machine called &quot;the bird&quot; which he built from starched linen, leather joints, and raw silk thongs. In the &quot;Codex Atlanticus&quot;, he wrote, &quot;Tomorrow morning, on the second day of January 1496, I will make the thong and the attempt.&quot; According to one commonly repeated, albeit presumably fictional story, in 1505 Leonardo or one of his pupils attempted to fly from the summit of Monte Ceceri.

==Lighter than air==

===Beginnings of modern theories===
Francesco Lana de Terzi proposed in &quot;Prodromo dell&#x27;Arte Maestra&quot; (1670) that large vessels could float in the atmosphere by applying the principles of a vacuum. Lana designed an airship with four huge copper foil spheres connected to support a rider&#x27;s basket, a tail, and a steering rudder. Critics argued that the thin copper spheres could not sustain ambient air pressure, and further experiments proved that his idea was impossible.

Using a vacuum to create lift is called a vacuum airship, but it is still impossible to build with the materials available today.

In 1709, Bartolomeu de Gusmão approached King John V of Portugal and claimed to have discovered a way for airborne flight.

Due to the King&#x27;s illness, Gusmão&#x27;s experiment was rescheduled from its initial 24 June 1709, date to 8 August. The experiment was carried out in front of the king and other nobles in the Casa da India yard, but the paper ship or device burned down before it could take flight.

=== Balloons ===

In France, five aviation firsts were accomplished between 4 June and 1 December 1783:
* On 4 June, a crowd gathered in Annonay, France, to witness the unmanned hot air balloon display by the Montgolfier brothers. Their 500-pound balloon ascended to nearly 3,000 feet and traveled over a mile and a half. It stayed in the air for ten minutes before tipping over and catching fire.
* On 27 August, Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers unveiled the first unmanned hydrogen balloon from Paris&#x27; Champ de Mars. It landed almost an hour later in Gonesse, where terrified farmers mistook it for a monster and destroyed it.
* On 19 October, in front of 2,000 spectators, Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis d&#x27;Arlandes boarded the Montgolfier aircraft as the first people. Later that day, Giroud de Villette, another pilot, took to the skies much higher.
* On 21 November, the Montgolfiers launched the first free flight with human passengers. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier, along with the Marquis François d&#x27;Arlandes, successfully petitioned for the honour. They drifted in a balloon powered by a wood fire.
* On 1 December, Jacques Charles and the Nicolas-Louis Robert launched their manned hydrogen balloon from the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris, as a crowd of 400,000 witnessed. They ascended to a height of about [15] and landed at sunset in Nesles-la-Vallée after a flight of 2 hours and 5 minutes, covering 36 km. After Robert alighted Charles decided to ascend alone. This time he ascended rapidly to an altitude of about , where he saw the sun again, suffered extreme pain in his ears, and never flew again.

Ballooning became a major interest in Europe in the late 18th century, providing the first detailed understanding of the relationship between altitude and the atmosphere.

Non-steerable balloons were employed during the American Civil War by the Union Army Balloon Corps. The young Ferdinand von Zeppelin first flew as a balloon passenger with the Union Army of the Potomac in 1863.

In the early 1900s, ballooning was a popular sport in Britain. These privately owned balloons usually used coal gas as the lifting gas. This has half the lifting power of hydrogen so the balloons had to be larger, however, coal gas was far more readily available and the local gas works sometimes provided a special lightweight formula for ballooning events.

=== Airships ===

Airships were originally called &quot;dirigible balloons&quot; and are still sometimes called dirigibles today.

Work on developing a steerable (or dirigible) balloon continued sporadically throughout the 19th century. The first powered, controlled, sustained lighter-than-air flight is believed to have taken place in 1852 when Henri Giffard flew in France, with a steam engine-driven craft.

Another advancement was made in 1884, when the first fully controllable free-flight was made in a French Army electric-powered airship, &quot;La France&quot;, by Charles Renard and Arthur Krebs. The long, airship covered in 23 minutes with the aid of an 8½ horsepower electric motor.

However, these aircraft were generally short-lived and extremely frail. Routine, controlled flights did not occur until the advent of the internal combustion engine.
The first aircraft to make routine controlled flights were non-rigid airships (sometimes called &quot;blimps&quot;.) The most successful early pioneering pilot of this type of aircraft was the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont who effectively combined a balloon with an internal combustion engine. On 19 October 1901, he flew his airship &quot;Number 6&quot; over Paris from the Parc de Saint Cloud around the Eiffel Tower and back in under 30 minutes to win the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize. Santos-Dumont went on to design and build several aircraft. The subsequent controversy surrounding his and others&#x27; competing claims with regard to aircraft overshadowed his great contribution to the development of airships.

At the same time that non-rigid airships were starting to have some success, the first successful rigid airships were also being developed. These were far more capable than fixed-wing aircraft in terms of pure cargo-carrying capacity for decades. Rigid airship design and advancement was pioneered by the German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin.

Construction of the first Zeppelin airship began in 1899 in a floating assembly hall on Lake Constance in the Bay of Manzell, Friedrichshafen. This was intended to ease the starting procedure, as the hall could easily be aligned with the wind. The prototype airship &quot;LZ 1&quot; (LZ for &quot;Luftschiff Zeppelin&quot;) had a length of , was driven by two Daimler engines and balanced by moving a weight between its two nacelles.

Its first flight, on 2 July 1900, lasted for only 18 minutes, as &quot;LZ 1&quot; was forced to land on the lake after the winding mechanism for the balancing weight had broken. Upon repair, the technology proved its potential in subsequent flights, bettering the 6 m/s speed attained by the French airship &quot;La France&quot; by 3 m/s, but could not yet convince possible investors. It was several years before the Count was able to raise enough funds for another try.

The German airship passenger service known as DELAG (Deutsche-Luftschiffahrts AG) was established in 1910.

Although airships were used in both World War I and II, and continue on a limited basis to this day, their development has been largely overshadowed by heavier-than-air craft.

==Heavier than air==
===17th and 18th centuries===
Traveller Evliya Çelebi reported that in 1633, Ottoman scientist and engineer Lagari Hasan Çelebi blasted off from Sarayburnu in a 7-winged rocket propelled by 50 okka (140 lbs) of gunpowder. The flight was said to have been undertaken at the time of the birth of Sultan Murad IV&#x27;s daughter. As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launching his craft &quot;O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus!&quot;; after ascending in the rocket, he landed in the sea, swimming ashore and joking &quot;O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you!&quot;; he was rewarded by the Sultan with silver and the rank of sipahi in the Ottoman army. Evliya Çelebi also wrote of Lagari&#x27;s brother, Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, making a flight by glider a year earlier.

Italian inventor Tito Livio Burattini, invited by the Polish King Władysław IV to his court in Warsaw, built a model aircraft with four fixed glider wings in 1647. Described as &quot;four pairs of wings attached to an elaborate &#x27;dragon&#x27;&quot;, it was said to have successfully lifted a cat in 1648 but not Burattini himself. He promised that &quot;only the most minor injuries&quot; would result from landing the craft. His &quot;Dragon Volant&quot; is considered &quot;the most elaborate and sophisticated aeroplane to be built before the 19th Century&quot;.

The first published paper on aviation was &quot;Sketch of a Machine for Flying in the Air&quot; by Emanuel Swedenborg published in 1716. This flying machine consisted of a light frame covered with strong canvas and provided with two large oars or wings moving on a horizontal axis, arranged so that the upstroke met with no resistance while the downstroke provided lifting power. Swedenborg knew that the machine would not fly, but suggested it as a start and was confident that the problem would be solved. Swedenborg proved prescient in his observation that a method of powering of an aircraft was one of the critical problems to be overcome.

On 16 May 1793, the Spanish inventor Diego Marín Aguilera managed to cross the river Arandilla in Coruña del Conde, Castile, flying 300 to 400 m with a flying machine.

===19th century===
Balloon jumping replaced tower jumping, also demonstrating with typically fatal results that man-power and flapping wings were useless in achieving flight. At the same time scientific study of heavier-than-air flight began in earnest. In 1801, the French officer André Guillaume Resnier de Goué managed a 300-metre glide by starting from the top of the city walls of Angoulême and he broke one leg on arrival. In 1837, French mathematician and brigadier general Isidore Didion stated, &quot;Aviation will be successful only if one finds an engine whose ratio with the weight of the device to be supported will be larger than current steam machines or the strength developed by humans or most of the animals&quot;.

==== Sir George Cayley and the first modern aircraft ====
Sir George Cayley was first called the &quot;father of the aeroplane&quot; in 1846. During the last years of the 18th century, he had begun the first rigorous study of the physics of flight and would later design the first modern heavier-than-air craft. Among his many achievements, his most important contributions to aeronautics include:
* Clarifying our ideas and laying down the principles of heavier-than-air flight.
* Reaching a scientific understanding of the principles of bird flight.
* Scientific aerodynamic experiments were conducted to demonstrate drag and streamlining, movement of the center of pressure, and the increase in lift from curving the wing surface.
* Defining the modern aeroplane configuration comprising a fixed-wing, fuselage and tail assembly.
* Demonstrations of manned, gliding flight.
* Identified the crucial understanding that a lightweight, powerful engine would be necessary for sustained heavier-than-air flight, now known as the power-to-weight ratio
* Recognized for establishing the theoretical foundation for engine use in airplanes and modern aircraft design by identifying and explaining the four fundamental forces of flight: lift, thrust, drag, and weight.
Cayley&#x27;s research on the aeroplane aimed to address the four fundamental areas that are essential to aeronautics: propulsion, structural design, aerodynamics, and stability and control. His work laid the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of these critical components, which continue to be vital in the field today.

Cayley&#x27;s first innovation was to study the basic science of lift by adopting the whirling arm test rig for use in aircraft research and using simple aerodynamic models on the arm, rather than attempting to fly a model of a complete design.

In 1799, he set down the concept of the modern aeroplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control.

In 1804, Cayley constructed a model glider, which was the first modern heavier-than-air flying machine. It had the layout of a conventional modern aircraft, with an inclined wing towards the front and an adjustable tail at the back with both tailplane and fin. A movable weight allowed adjustment of the model&#x27;s centre of gravity.
In 1809, goaded by the farcical antics of his contemporaries, he began the publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled &quot;On Aerial Navigation&quot; (1809–1810). In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, &quot;The whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air&quot;. He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: thrust, lift, drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs. He also identified and described the importance of the cambered aerofoil, dihedral, diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of ornithopters and parachutes.

In 1848, he had progressed far enough to construct a glider in the form of a triplane large and safe enough to carry a child. A local boy was chosen; his name is unknown.

He went on to publish in 1852 the design for a full-size manned glider or &quot;governable parachute&quot; to be launched from a balloon. He then constructed a version capable of launching from the top of a hill, which carried the first adult aviator across Brompton Dale in 1853.

====Age of steam====

Drawing directly from Cayley&#x27;s work, Henson&#x27;s 1842 design for an aerial steam carriage broke new ground. Although only a design, it was the first in history for a propeller-driven fixed-wing aircraft.

1866 saw the founding of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain and two years later the world&#x27;s first aeronautical exhibition was held at the Crystal Palace, London, where John Stringfellow was awarded a £100 prize for the steam engine with the best power-to-weight ratio. In 1848, Stringfellow achieved the first powered flight using an unmanned wingspan steam-powered monoplane built in a disused lace factory in Chard, Somerset. Employing two contra-rotating propellers on the first attempt, made indoors, the machine flew ten feet before becoming destabilised, damaging the craft. The second attempt was more successful, the machine leaving a guidewire to fly freely, achieving thirty yards of straight and level powered flight. Francis Herbert Wenham presented the first paper to the newly formed Aeronautical Society (later the Royal Aeronautical Society), &quot;On Aerial Locomotion&quot;. He advanced Cayley&#x27;s work on cambered wings, making important findings. To test his ideas, from 1858 he had constructed several gliders, both manned and unmanned, and with up to five stacked wings. He realised that long, thin wings are better than bat-like ones because they have more leading edge for their area. Today this relationship is known as the aspect ratio of a wing.

The latter part of the 19th century became a period of intense study, characterized by the &quot;gentleman scientists&quot; who represented most research efforts until the 20th century. Among them was the British scientist-philosopher and inventor Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, who studied lateral flight control and was the first to patent an aileron control system in 1868.

In 1871, Wenham made the first wind tunnel using a fan, driven by a steam engine, to propel air down a tube to the model.
Meanwhile, the British advances had galvanised French researchers. In 1857, Félix du Temple proposed a monoplane with a tailplane and retractable undercarriage. Developing his ideas with a model powered first by clockwork and later by steam, he eventually achieved a short hop with a full-size manned craft in 1874. It achieved lift-off under its own power after launching from a ramp, glided for a short time and returned safely to the ground, making it the first successful powered glide in history.

In 1865, Louis Pierre Mouillard published an influential book &quot;The Empire Of The Air&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;Empire de l&#x27;Air&quot;).
In 1856, Frenchman Jean-Marie Le Bris made the first flight higher than his point of departure, by having his glider &quot;&quot;L&#x27;Albatros artificiel&quot; pulled by a horse on a beach. He reportedly achieved a height of 100 metres, over a distance of 200 metres.
Alphonse Pénaud, a Frenchman, advanced the theory of wing contours and aerodynamics. He also constructed successful models of aeroplanes, helicopters and ornithopters. In 1871 he flew the first aerodynamically stable fixed-wing aeroplane, a model monoplane he called the &quot;Planophore&quot;, a distance of . Pénaud&#x27;s model incorporated several of Cayley&#x27;s discoveries, including the use of a tail, wing dihedral for inherent stability, and rubber power. The planophore also had longitudinal stability, being trimmed such that the tailplane was set at a smaller angle of incidence than the wings, an original and important contribution to the theory of aeronautics. Pénaud&#x27;s later project for an amphibian aeroplane, although never built, incorporated other modern features. A tailless monoplane with a single vertical fin and twin tractor propellers, it also featured hinged rear elevator and rudder surfaces, retractable undercarriage and a fully enclosed, instrumented cockpit.
Another theorist was Frenchman Victor Tatin. In 1879, he flew a model which, like Pénaud&#x27;s project, was a monoplane with twin tractor propellers but also had a separate horizontal tail. It was powered by compressed air. Flown tethered to a pole, this was the first model to take off under its own power.

In 1884, Alexandre Goupil published his work &quot;La Locomotion Aérienne&quot; (&quot;Aerial Locomotion&quot;), although the flying machine he later constructed failed to fly.
In 1890, the French engineer Clément Ader completed the first of three steam-driven flying machines, the &quot;Éole&quot;. On 9 October 1890, Ader made an uncontrolled hop of around ; this was the first manned aeroplane to take off under its own power. His &quot;Avion III&quot; of 1897, notable only for having twin steam engines, failed to fly: Ader later claimed success and was not debunked until 1910 when the French Army published its report on his attempt.

Sir Hiram Maxim was an American engineer who had moved to England. He built his own whirling arm rig and wind tunnel and constructed a large machine with a wingspan of , a length of , fore and aft horizontal surfaces and a crew of three. Twin propellers were powered by two lightweight compound steam engines each delivering . The overall weight was . It was intended as a test rig to investigate aerodynamic lift; because it lacked flight controls it ran on rails, with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it. Completed in 1894, on its third run it broke from the rail, became airborne for about 200 yards at two to three feet of altitude and was badly damaged upon falling back to the ground. It was subsequently repaired, but Maxim abandoned his experiments shortly afterwards.

=== Manned gliders and Otto Lilienthal ===
Around the last decade of the 19th century, a number of key figures were refining and defining the modern aeroplane. Lacking a suitable engine, aircraft work focused on stability and control in gliding flight. In 1879, Biot constructed a bird-like glider with the help of Massia and flew in it briefly. It is preserved in the Musee de l&#x27;Air, France, and is claimed to be the earliest man-carrying flying machine still in existence.

The Englishman Horatio Phillips made key contributions to aerodynamics. He conducted extensive wind tunnel research on aerofoil sections, proving the principles of aerodynamic lift foreseen by Cayley and Wenham. His findings underpin all modern aerofoil design. Between 1883 and 1886, the American John Joseph Montgomery developed a series of three manned gliders, before conducting his own independent investigations into aerodynamics and circulation of lift.
Otto Lilienthal became known as the &quot;Glider King&quot; or &quot;Flying Man&quot; of Germany. He duplicated Wenham&#x27;s work and greatly expanded on it in 1884, publishing his research in 1889 as &quot;Birdflight as the Basis of Aviation&quot; (&quot;Der Vogelflug als Grundlage der Fliegekunst&quot;), which is seen as one of the most important works in aviation history. He also produced a series of hang gliders, including bat-wing, monoplane, and biplane forms, such as the Derwitzer Glider and Normal soaring apparatus, which is considered to be the first airplane in series production, making the &quot;Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal&quot; the first airplane production company in the world.

Starting in 1891, he became the first person to make controlled untethered glides routinely, and the first to be photographed flying a heavier-than-air machine, stimulating interest around the world. Lilienthal&#x27;s work led to him developing the concept of the modern wing. His flights in the year 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight and because of that he is often referred to as either the &quot;father of aviation&quot; or &quot;father of flight&quot;.

He rigorously documented his work, including photographs, and for this reason is one of the best known of the early pioneers. Lilienthal made over 2,000 glider flights until his death in 1896 from injuries sustained in a glider crash.

Picking up where Lilienthal left off, Octave Chanute took up aircraft design after an early retirement, and funded the development of several gliders. In the summer of 1896, his team flew several of their designs eventually deciding that the best was a biplane design. Like Lilienthal, he documented and photographed his work.

In Britain Percy Pilcher, who had worked for Maxim, built and successfully flew several gliders during the mid to late 1890s.

The invention of the box kite during this period by the Australian Lawrence Hargrave led to the development of the practical biplane. In 1894, Hargrave linked four of his kites together, added a sling seat, and was the first to obtain lift with a heavier than air aircraft, when he flew up . Later pioneers of manned kite flying included Samuel Franklin Cody in England and Captain Génie Saconney in France.

William Frost from Pembrokeshire, Wales started his project in 1880 and after 16 years, he designed a flying machine and in 1894 won a patent for a &quot;Frost Aircraft Glider&quot;. Reports say witnesses claimed the craft flew at Saundersfoot in 1896, travelling 500 yards before colliding with a tree and falling in a field.

=== Langley ===

After a distinguished career in astronomy and shortly before becoming Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Samuel Pierpont Langley started a serious investigation into aerodynamics at what is today the University of Pittsburgh. In 1891, he published &quot;Experiments in Aerodynamics&quot; detailing his research, and then turned to building his designs. He hoped to achieve automatic aerodynamic stability, so he gave little consideration to in-flight control. On 6 May 1896, Langley&#x27;s &quot;Aerodrome No. 5&quot; made the first successful sustained flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made that afternoon, one of and a second of , at a speed of approximately . On both occasions, the &quot;Aerodrome No. 5&quot; landed in the water as planned, because, in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing gear. On 28 November 1896, another successful flight was made with the &quot;Aerodrome No. 6&quot;. This flight, of , was witnessed and photographed by Alexander Graham Bell. The &quot;Aerodrome No. 6&quot; was actually &quot;Aerodrome No. 4&quot; greatly modified. So little remained of the original aircraft that it was given a new designation.

With the successes of the &quot;Aerodrome No. 5&quot; and &quot;No. 6&quot;, Langley started looking for funding to build a full-scale man-carrying version of his designs. Spurred by the Spanish–American War, the U.S. government granted him $50,000 to develop a man-carrying flying machine for aerial reconnaissance. Langley planned on building a scaled-up version known as the Aerodrome A, and started with the smaller Quarter-scale Aerodrome, which flew twice on 18 June 1901, and then again with a newer and more powerful engine in 1903.

With the basic design apparently successfully tested, he then turned to the problem of a suitable engine. He contracted Stephen Balzer to build one, but was disappointed when it delivered only instead of the he expected. Langley&#x27;s assistant, Charles M. Manly, then reworked the design into a five-cylinder water-cooled radial that delivered at 950 rpm, a feat that took years to duplicate. Now with both power and a design, Langley put the two together with great hopes.

To his dismay, the resulting aircraft proved to be too fragile. Simply scaling up the original small models resulted in a design that was too weak to hold itself together. Two launches in late 1903 both ended with the &quot;Aerodrome&quot; immediately crashing into the water. The pilot, Manly, was rescued each time. Also, the aircraft&#x27;s control system was inadequate to allow quick pilot responses, and it had no method of lateral control, and the &quot;Aerodrome&quot;″s aerial stability was marginal.

Langley&#x27;s attempts to gain further funding failed, and his efforts ended. Nine days after his second abortive launch on 8 December, the Wright brothers successfully flew their &quot;Flyer&quot;. Glenn Curtiss made 93 modifications to the &quot;Aerodrome&quot; and flew this very different aircraft in 1914. Without acknowledging the modifications, the Smithsonian Institution asserted that Langley&#x27;s &quot;Aerodrome&quot; was the first machine &quot;capable of flight&quot;.

===Whitehead===

Gustave Weißkopf was a German who emigrated to the U.S., where he soon changed his name to Whitehead. From 1897 to 1915, he designed and built early flying machines and engines. On 14 August 1901, two and a half years before the Wright Brothers&#x27; flight, he claimed to have carried out a controlled, powered flight in his Number 21 monoplane at Fairfield, Connecticut. The flight was reported in the &quot;Bridgeport Sunday Herald&quot; local newspaper. About 30 years later, several people questioned by a researcher claimed to have seen that or other Whitehead flights.

In March 2013, &quot;Jane&#x27;s All the World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot;, an authoritative source for contemporary aviation, published an editorial which accepted Whitehead&#x27;s flight as the first manned, powered, controlled flight of a heavier-than-air craft. The Smithsonian Institution (custodians of the original &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;) and many aviation historians continue to maintain that Whitehead did not fly as suggested. The historians of the Royal Aeronautical Society noted that: &quot;All available evidence fails to support the claim that Gustave Whitehead made sustained, powered, controlled flights predating those of the Wright brothers.&quot; The editors of &quot;Scientific American&quot; agree: &quot;The data show that not only was Whitehead not first in flight, but that he may never have made a controlled, powered flight at any time.&quot;

=== Pearse ===

Richard Pearse was a New Zealand farmer and inventor who performed pioneering aviation experiments. Witnesses interviewed many years afterward claimed that Pearse flew and landed a powered heavier-than-air machine on 31 March 1903, nine months before the Wright brothers flew.  Documentary evidence for these claims remains open to interpretation and dispute, and Pearse himself never made such claims. In a newspaper interview in 1909, he said he did not &quot;attempt anything practical ... until 1904&quot;. If he did fly in 1903, the flight appears to have been poorly controlled in comparison to the Wrights&#x27;.

=== Wright brothers ===
Using a methodical approach and concentrating on the controllability of the aircraft, the brothers built and tested a series of kite and glider designs from 1898 to 1902 before attempting to build a powered design. The gliders worked, but not as well as the Wrights had expected based on the experiments and writings of their predecessors. Their first full-size glider, launched in 1900, had only about half the lift they anticipated. Their second glider, built the following year, performed even more poorly. Rather than giving up, the Wrights constructed their own wind tunnel and created a number of sophisticated devices to measure lift and drag on the 200 wing designs they tested. As a result, the Wrights corrected earlier mistakes in calculations regarding drag and lift. Their testing and calculating produced a third glider with a higher aspect ratio and true three-axis control. They flew it successfully hundreds of times in 1902, and it performed far better than the previous models. By using a rigorous system of experimentation, involving wind-tunnel testing of airfoils and flight testing of full-size prototypes, the Wrights not only built a working aircraft the following year, the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;, but also helped advance the science of aeronautical engineering.
The Wrights appear to be the first to make serious studied attempts to simultaneously solve the power and control problems. Both problems proved difficult, but they never lost interest. They solved the control problem by inventing wing warping for roll control, combined with simultaneous yaw control with a steerable rear rudder. Almost as an afterthought, they designed and built a low-powered internal combustion engine. They also designed and carved wooden propellers that were more efficient than any before, enabling them to gain adequate performance from their low engine power. Although wing-warping as a means of lateral control was used only briefly during the early history of aviation, the principle of combining lateral control in combination with a rudder was a key advance in aircraft control. While many aviation pioneers appeared to leave safety largely to chance, the Wrights&#x27; design was greatly influenced by the need to teach themselves to fly without unreasonable risk to life and limb, by surviving crashes. This emphasis, as well as low engine power, was the reason for low flying speed and for taking off in a headwind. Performance, rather than safety, was the reason for the rear-heavy design because the canard could not be highly loaded; anhedral wings were less affected by crosswinds and were consistent with the low yaw stability.

According to the Smithsonian Institution and Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), the Wrights made the first sustained, controlled, powered heavier-than-air manned flight at Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, four miles (8 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on 17 December 1903.

The first flight by Orville Wright, of in 12 seconds, was recorded in a famous photograph. In the fourth flight of the same day, Wilbur Wright flew in 59 seconds. The flights were witnessed by three coastal lifesaving crewmen, a local businessman, and a boy from the village, making these the first public flights and the first well-documented ones.

Orville described the final flight of the day: &quot;The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, but by the time three hundred feet had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began pitching again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be ; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but the main part of the machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two&quot;. They flew only about ten feet above the ground as a safety precaution, so they had little room to manoeuvre, and all four flights in the gusty winds ended in a bumpy and unintended &quot;landing&quot;. Modern analysis by Professor Fred E. C. Culick and Henry R. Rex (1985) has demonstrated that the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; was so unstable as to be almost unmanageable by anyone but the Wrights, who had trained themselves in the 1902 glider.

The Wrights continued flying at Huffman Prairie near Dayton, Ohio in 1904–05. In May 1904 they introduced the &quot;Flyer II&quot;, a heavier and improved version of the original Flyer. On 23 June 1905, they first flew a third machine, the &quot;Flyer III&quot;. After a severe crash on 14 July 1905, they rebuilt the &quot;Flyer III&quot; and made important design changes. They almost doubled the size of the elevator and rudder and moved them about twice the distance from the wings. They added two fixed vertical vanes (called &quot;blinkers&quot;) between the elevators and gave the wings a very slight dihedral. They disconnected the rudder from the wing-warping control, and as in all future aircraft, placed it on a separate control handle. When flights resumed the results were immediate. The serious pitch instability that hampered Flyers I and II was significantly reduced, so repeated minor crashes were eliminated. Flights with the redesigned &quot;Flyer III&quot; started lasting over 10 minutes, then 20, then 30. &quot;Flyer III&quot; became the first practical aircraft (though without wheels and needing a launching device), flying consistently under full control and bringing its pilot back to the starting point safely and landing without damage. On 5 October 1905, Wilbur flew in 39 minutes 23 seconds.

According to the April 1907 issue of the &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine, the Wright brothers seemed to have the most advanced knowledge of heavier-than-air navigation at the time. However, the same magazine issue also claimed that no public flight had been made in the United States before its April 1907 issue. Hence, they devised the Scientific American Aeronautic Trophy in order to encourage the development of a heavier-than-air flying machine. Glenn H. Curtiss won the trophy in 1908 with the first pre-announced and officially recorded flight of the June Bug.

== History ==

=== Pioneer Era (1903–1914) ===

This period saw the development of practical aeroplanes and airships and their early application, alongside balloons and kites, for private, sport and military use.

====Pioneers in Europe====
Although the full details of the Wright Brothers&#x27; system of flight control had been published in l&#x27;Aerophile in January 1906, the importance of this advance was not recognised, and European experimenters generally concentrated on attempting to produce inherently stable machines.

Short powered flights were performed in France by Romanian engineer Traian Vuia on 18 March and 19 August 1906 when he flew 12 and 24 metres, respectively, in a self-designed, fully self-propelled, fixed-wing aircraft, that possessed a fully wheeled undercarriage. He was followed by Jacob Ellehammer who built a monoplane which he tested with a tether in Denmark on 12 September 1906, flying 42 metres.

On 13 September 1906, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont made a public flight in Paris with the 14-bis, also known as &quot;Oiseau de proie&quot; (French for &quot;bird of prey&quot;). This was canard configured with a pronounced wing dihedral, and covered a distance of on the grounds of the Chateau de Bagatelle in Paris&#x27; Bois de Boulogne before a large crowd of witnesses. This well-documented event was the first flight verified by the Aéro-Club de France of a powered heavier-than-air machine in Europe and won the Deutsch-Archdeacon Prize for the first officially observed flight greater than . On 12 November 1906, Santos-Dumont set the first world record recognized by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale by flying in 21.5 seconds. Only one more brief flight was made by the 14-bis in March 1907, after which it was abandoned.

In March 1907, Gabriel Voisin flew the first example of his Voisin biplane. On 13 January 1908, a second example was flown by Henri Farman to win the Deutsch-Archdeacon &quot;Grand Prix d&#x27;Aviation&quot; prize for a flight in which the aircraft flew a distance of more than a kilometre and landed at the point where it had taken off. The flight lasted 1 minute and 28 seconds.

====Flight as an established technology====
Santos-Dumont later added ailerons between the wings in an effort to gain more lateral stability. His final design, first flown in 1907, was the series of Demoiselle monoplanes (Nos. 19 to 22). The &quot;Demoiselle No 19&quot; could be constructed in only 15 days and became the world&#x27;s first series production aircraft. The Demoiselle achieved 120 km/h. The fuselage consisted of three specially reinforced bamboo booms. The pilot sat in a seat between the main wheels of a conventional landing gear whose pair of wire-spoked mainwheels were located at the lower front of the airframe, with a tailskid half-way back beneath the rear fuselage structure. The Demoiselle was controlled in flight by a cruciform tail unit hinged on a form of universal joint at the aft end of the fuselage structure to function as elevator and rudder, with roll control provided through wing warping (No. 20), with the wings only warping &quot;down&quot;.

In 1908, Wilbur Wright travelled to Europe, and starting in August gave a series of flight demonstrations at Le Mans in France. The first demonstration, made on 8 August, attracted an audience including most of the major French aviation experimenters, who were astonished by the clear superiority of the Wright Brothers&#x27; aircraft, particularly its ability to make tight controlled turns. The importance of using roll control in making turns was recognised by almost all the European experimenters: Henri Farman fitted ailerons to his Voisin biplane and shortly afterwards set up his own aircraft construction business, whose first product was the influential Farman III biplane.

The following year saw the widespread recognition of powered flight as something other than the preserve of dreamers and eccentrics. On 25 July 1909, Louis Blériot won worldwide fame by winning a £1,000 prize offered by the British &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper for a flight across the English Channel, and in August around half a million people, including the President of France Armand Fallières and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George, attended one of the first aviation meetings, the Grande Semaine d&#x27;Aviation at Reims.

In 1914, pioneering aviator Tony Jannus captained the inaugural flight of the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, the world&#x27;s first commercial passenger airline.

Historians disagree about whether the Wright brothers patent war impeded development of the aviation industry in the United States compared to Europe. The patent war ended during World War I when the government pressured the industry into forming a patent pool, and major litigants had left the industry.

==== Rotorcraft ====
In 1877, the Italian engineer, inventor and aeronautical pioneer Enrico Forlanini developed an unmanned helicopter powered by a steam engine. It rose to a height of , where it remained for 20 seconds, after a vertical take-off from a park in Milan. Milan has dedicated its city airport to Enrico Forlanini, the airport is also named Linate Airport, as well as the nearby park, the Parco Forlanini. In Milan he also has an avenue named after him, Viale Enrico Forlanini.

The first time a manned helicopter is known to have risen off the ground was on a tethered flight in 1907 by the Breguet-Richet Gyroplane. Later the same year the Cornu helicopter, also French, made the first rotary-winged free flight at Lisieux, France. However, these were not practical designs.

==== Military use ====
Almost as soon as they were invented, aeroplanes were used for military purposes. The first country to use them for military purposes was Italy, whose aircraft made reconnaissance, bombing and artillery correction flights in Libya during the Italian-Turkish war (September 1911 – October 1912). This war also saw Ottoman soldiers shoot down a warplane for the first time in history. The first warplane reconnaissance mission flown on 23 October 1911 by the Italian air force&#x27;s Captain Carlo Piazza, and the first bombing mission was flown on 1 November 1911 by Italy&#x27;s Second Lieutenant Giolio Gavotti. Bulgaria later followed this example. Its planes attacked and reconnoitred Ottoman positions during the First Balkan War 1912–13. The first war to see major use of aeroplanes in offensive, defensive and reconnaissance capabilities was World War I. The Allies and Central Powers both used aeroplanes and airships extensively.

While the concept of using the aeroplane as an offensive weapon was generally discounted before World War I, the idea of using it for photography was one that was not lost on any of the major forces. All of the major forces in Europe had light aircraft, typically derived from pre-war sporting designs, attached to their reconnaissance departments. Radiotelephones were also being explored on aeroplanes, notably the SCR-68, as communication between pilots and ground commander grew more and more important.

===World War I (1914–1918)===

==== Combat schemes ====
It was not long before aircraft were shooting at each other, but the lack of any sort of steady point for the gun was a problem. The French solved this problem when, in late 1914, Roland Garros attached a fixed machine gun to the front of his plane. Adolphe Pegoud became known as the first &quot;ace&quot;, getting credit for five victories before also becoming the first ace to die in action, it was German Luftstreitkräfte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens who, on 1 July 1915, scored the very first aerial victory by a purpose-built fighter plane, with a synchronized machine gun.

Aviators were styled as modern-day knights, doing individual combat with their enemies. Several pilots became famous for their air-to-air combat; the most well known is Manfred von Richthofen, better known as the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, who shot down 80 planes in air-to-air combat with several different planes, the most celebrated of which was the Fokker Dr.I. On the Allied side, René Paul Fonck is credited with the most all-time victories at 75, even when later wars are considered.

France, Britain, Germany, and Italy were the leading manufacturers of fighter planes that saw action during the war, with German aviation technologist Hugo Junkers showing the way to the future through his pioneering use of all-metal aircraft from late 1915.

===Between the World Wars (1918–1939)===


The years between World War I and World War II saw great advancements in aircraft technology. Airplanes evolved from low-powered biplanes made from wood and fabric to sleek, high-powered monoplanes made of aluminum, based primarily on the founding work of Hugo Junkers during the World War I period and its adoption by American designer William Bushnell Stout and Soviet designer Andrei Tupolev.

After World War I, experienced fighter pilots were eager to show off their skills. Many American pilots became barnstormers, flying into small towns across the country and showing off their flying abilities, as well as taking paying passengers for rides. Eventually, the barnstormers grouped into more organized displays. Air shows sprang up around the country, with air races, acrobatic stunts, and feats of air superiority. The air races drove engine and airframe development—the Schneider Trophy, for example, led to a series of ever faster and sleeker monoplane designs culminating in the Supermarine S.6B. With pilots competing for cash prizes, there was an incentive to go faster. Amelia Earhart was perhaps the most famous of those on the barnstorming/air show circuit. She was also the first female pilot to achieve records such as the crossing of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

Prizes for distance and speed records also drove development forwards. On 14 June 1919, Captain John Alcock and Lieutenant Arthur Brown co-piloted a Vickers Vimy non-stop from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland to Clifden, Ireland, winning the £13,000 ($65,000). Northcliffe prize. The first flight across the South Atlantic and the first aerial crossing using astronomical navigation, was made by the naval aviators Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral in 1922, from Lisbon, Portugal, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using an aircraft fitted with an artificial horizon for aeronautical use. In 1924, Major General Mason Patrick led a group of U.S. Army Air Service members to complete the first aerial circumnavigation of the world. This flight around the world came with many logistical challenges, traveling 26,343 miles over the span of 175 days. This flight led to improved foreign relations by promoting commercial collaboration, and greater public interest in aviation, prompting governments to put more resources into developing their aviation forces. On 21 May 1927, Charles Lindbergh received the Orteig Prize of $25,000 for the first &quot;solo&quot; non-stop crossing of the Atlantic. This caused what was known in aviation at the time as the &quot;Lindbergh boom&quot;, which increased public interest in aviation.

Australian Sir Charles Kingsford Smith was the first to fly across the larger Pacific Ocean in the Southern Cross. His crew left Oakland, California to make the first trans-Pacific flight to Australia, making three stops to complete the journey. Kingsford-Smith and his crew made their first stop in Hawaii from Oakland, California, and from Hawaii to Suva, Fiji. During the last segment of their journey from Fiji to Brisbane, Australia, they encountered severe thunderstorms, and were thrown nearly 140 miles off their course. The flight concluded on 9 June 1928 after flying 7,230 miles, Kingsford-Smith and his crew landed in Brisbane, Australia, receiving $25,000 from the Australian government for their achievement. Accompanying him were Australian aviator Charles Ulm as the relief pilot, and the Americans James Warner and Captain Harry Lyon (who were the radio operator, navigator and engineer). A week after they landed, Kingsford Smith and Ulm recorded a disc for Columbia talking about their trip. With Ulm, Kingsford Smith later continued his journey being the first in 1929 to circumnavigate the world, crossing the equator twice.

The first lighter-than-air crossings of the Atlantic were made by airship in July 1919 by His Majesty&#x27;s Airship R34 and crew when they flew from East Lothian, Scotland to Long Island, New York and then back to Pulham, England. By 1929, airship technology had advanced to the point that the first round-the-world flight was completed by the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; in September and in October, the same aircraft inaugurated the first commercial transatlantic service. However, the age of the rigid airship ended following the destruction by fire of the zeppelin LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot; just before landing at Lakehurst, New Jersey on 6 May 1937, killing 35 of the 97 people aboard. Previous spectacular airship accidents, from the &quot;Wingfoot Express&quot; disaster (1919), the loss of the R101 (1930), the &quot;Akron&quot; (1933) and the &quot;Macon&quot; (1935) had already cast doubt on airship safety. The disasters of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s rigids showed the importance of solely using helium as the lifting medium. Following the destruction of the Hindenburg, the remaining airship making international flights, the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; was retired (June 1937). Its replacement, the rigid airship &quot;Graf Zeppelin II&quot;, made a number of flights, primarily over Germany, from 1938 to 1939, but was grounded when Germany began World War II. Both remaining German zeppelins were scrapped in 1940 to supply metal for the German Luftwaffe air force.

Meanwhile, Germany, which was restricted by the Treaty of Versailles in its development of powered aircraft, developed gliding as a sport, especially at the Wasserkuppe, during the 1920s. In its various forms, in the 21st-century sailplane aviation now has over 400,000 participants.

In 1929, Jimmy Doolittle developed flight instruments . 1929 also saw the first flight of by far the largest plane ever built until then: the Dornier Do X with a wingspan of 48 m. On its 70th test flight on 21 October 1929, there were 169 people on board, a record that was not broken for 20 years.

In 1923, The first successful rotorcraft appeared in the form of the autogyro, invented by Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva and first flown in 1919. In this design, the rotor is not powered but spins freely as it moves through the air, while a separate engine powers the aircraft to move forward. This was the basis of further development and prototypes that led to the creation of the helicopter. In 1930 Corradino D&#x27;Ascanio, an Italian engineer, developed a coaxial helicopter with the important inclusion of three small propellers on the craft, which controlled the pitch, roll, and yaw of the aircraft. Later helicopters saw several adjustments to their rotors but the first modern helicopter was not constructed until 1947 by Igor Sikorsky

Only five years after the German Dornier Do-X had flown, Tupolev designed the largest aircraft of the 1930s era, the &quot;Maksim Gorky&quot; in the Soviet Union by 1934, as the largest aircraft ever built using the Junkers methods of metal aircraft construction.

In the 1930s, development of the jet engines began in Germany and in Britain and they began testing in 1939 before World War II. The jet engine saw considerable development during the war, with a few jet powered aircraft being used in the war.
After enrolling in the Military Aviation Academy in Eskisehir in 1936 and undertaking training at the First Aircraft Regiment, Sabiha Gökçen, flew fighter and bomber planes becoming the first Turkish, female aviator and the world&#x27;s first, female, combat pilot. During her flying career, she achieved some 8,000 hours, 32 of which were combat missions.

=== World War II (1939–1945) ===
World War II saw a great increase in the pace of development and production, not only of aircraft but also the associated flight-based weapon delivery systems. Air combat tactics and doctrines started being rapidly developed. Large-scale strategic bombing campaigns were launched, fighter escorts introduced and the more flexible aircraft and weapons allowed precise attacks on small targets with dive bombers, fighter-bombers, and ground-attack aircraft. New technologies like radar also allowed more coordinated and controlled deployment of air defence.

The first jet aircraft to fly was the Heinkel He 178 (Germany), flown by Erich Warsitz in 1939, followed by the world&#x27;s first operational jet aircraft, the Messerschmitt Me 262, in July 1942 and world&#x27;s first jet-powered bomber, the Arado Ar 234, in June 1943. British developments, like the Gloster Meteor, followed afterwards, but saw only brief use in World War II. The first cruise missile (V-1), the first ballistic missile (V-2), the first (and to date only) operational rocket-powered combat aircraft Me 163—which attained velocities of up to in test flights—and the first vertical take-off a manned point-defence interceptor, the Bachem Ba 349 &quot;Natter&quot;, were also developed by Germany. However, jet and rocket aircraft had only limited impact due to their late introduction, fuel shortages, the lack of experienced pilots and the declining war industry of Germany.

Not only aeroplanes, but also helicopters saw rapid development in the Second World War, with the introduction of the Focke Achgelis Fa 223, the Flettner Fl 282 synchropter in 1941 in Germany and the Sikorsky R-4 in 1942 in the USA.

=== Postwar era (1945–1979) ===


Following World War II, commercial aviation expanded quickly, primarily relying on former military aircraft to carry passengers and cargo. There was an excess of large bombers, such as the B-29 and Lancaster, which were easily converted for commercial use. The DC-3 specifically played a key role, enabling longer and more efficient flights.

The British de Havilland Comet became the first commercial jet airliner and was introduced into scheduled service by 1952. The aircraft was a breakthrough in technical achievements, but had several intense failures. The square design of the windows caused stress cracks from metal fatigue, caused by cycles of cabin pressurization and depressurization. This eventually led to severe structural failures in the fuel area. These issues were resolved too late, since competing jet airliners were already flying. 

On 15 September 1956, the USSR’s airline Aeroflot became the first to offer continuous, regular jet services using the Tupolev Tu-104. Soon after, Boeing 707 and DC-8 also set new standards in comfort, safety, and passenger experience. This was the beginning of the Jet Age, the introduction of large-scale commercial air travel. 

In October 1947, Chuck Yeager became the first to fly faster than the speed of sound when he piloted the rocket-powered Bell X-1 past the sound barrier. The air speed record for an aircraft was set by the X-15 at 4,534 mph (7,297 km/h) or Mach 6.1 in 1967. This record was later broken by the X-43 in 2004, excluding spacecraft. 

Military aircraft had a strategic advantage during the Cold War with the invention of nuclear bombs in 1945. Even just a small fleet of bombers could inflict catastrophic damage, which caused for the development of effective defenses. One early development was supersonic interceptor aircraft. By 1955, the focus shifted toward guided surface-to-air missiles. This eventually led to the emergence of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which have nuclear capabilities. An early example of ICBMs occurred in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, beginning the Space Race. 

In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space when he completed a single orbit around Earth in 108 minutes aboard Vostok I. Following this, the United States sent Alan Shepard on a suborbital flight using a Mercury program capsule. In 1963, Canada became the third nation to enter space with the launch of its satellite, Alouette I. The space race culminated in the landing on the moon in 1969. 
The Harrier jump jet, capable of vertical landing and takeoff, first flew in 1969. This was also the year of the introduction of the Boeing 747. Additionally, the Aérospatiale-BAC Concorde supersonic passenger airliner had its maiden flight. The Boeing 747 was the largest commercial passenger aircraft ever to fly at the time, now replaced by the Airbus A380, capable of transporting 853 passengers. Aeroflot started flying the Tu-144—the first supersonic passenger plane in 1975. The next year, British Airways and Air France began supersonic flights over the Atlantic. 

In 1979, the Gossamer Albatross achieved the status of the first human-powered aircraft to fly over the English channel, which had been a dream for centuries.

=== Digital age (1980–present) ===


The last quarter of the 20th century saw a change of emphasis. No longer was revolutionary progress made in flight speeds, distances and materials technology. This part of the century instead saw the spreading of the digital revolution both in flight avionics and in aircraft design and manufacturing techniques.

In 1986, Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager flew an aircraft, the Rutan Voyager, around the world un-refuelled, and without landing. In 1999, Bertrand Piccard became the first person to circle the earth in a balloon.

Digital fly-by-wire systems allow an aircraft to be designed with relaxed static stability. These systems were initially used to increase the manoeuvrability of military aircraft such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, however they are now being used to reduce drag on commercial airliners.

The &quot;U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission&quot; was established in 1999 to encourage the broadest national and international participation in the celebration of 100 years of powered flight. It publicized and encouraged a number of programmes, projects and events intended to educate people about the history of aviation.

==21st century==
21st-century aviation has seen increasing interest in fuel savings and fuel diversification, as well as low cost airlines and facilities. Additionally, much of the developing world that did not have good access to air transport has been steadily adding aircraft and facilities; though severe congestion remains a problem in many up and coming nations. Around 20,000 city pairs are served by commercial aviation, up from less than 10,000 as recently as 1996.

There appears to be newfound interest in returning to the supersonic era whereby waning demand in the turn of the 20th century made flights unprofitable, as well as the final commercial stoppage of the Concorde due to reduced demand following a fatal accident and rising costs.

At the beginning of the 21st century, digital technology allowed subsonic military aviation to begin eliminating the pilot in favour of remotely operated or completely autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In April 2001, the unmanned aircraft Global Hawk flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and un-refuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003, the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. UAVs are now an established feature of modern warfare, carrying out pinpoint attacks under the control of a remote operator.

Major disruptions to air travel in the 21st century included the closing of U.S. airspace due to the September 11 attacks, and the closing of most of European airspace after the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull.

In 2015, André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard flew a record distance of from Nagoya, Japan to Honolulu, Hawaii in a solar-powered plane, Solar Impulse 2. The flight took nearly five days; during the nights the aircraft used its batteries and the potential energy gained during the day.

On 14 July 2019, Frenchman Franky Zapata attracted worldwide attention when he participated at the Bastille Day military parade riding his invention, a jet-powered Flyboard Air. He subsequently succeeded in crossing the English Channel on his device on 4 August 2019, covering the 35-kilometre (22 mi) journey from Sangatte in northern France to St Margaret&#x27;s Bay in Kent, UK, in 22 minutes, with a midpoint fueling stop included.

24 July 2019 was the busiest day in aviation, Flightradar24 recorded a total of over 225,000 flights that day. It includes helicopters, private jets, gliders, sight-seeing flights, as well as personal aircraft.

On 10 June 2020, the Pipistrel Velis Electro became the first electric aeroplane to secure a type certificate from EASA.

In the early 21st Century, the first fifth-generation military fighters were produced, starting with the F-22 Raptor. As of 2019, Russia, America and China have 5th gen aircraft.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as slump in demand among travellers, and may also affect the future of air travel. For example, the mandatory use of face masks on planes was common when flying in 2020 and 2021.

=== Mars ===
On 19 April 2021, NASA successfully flew its diminutive unmanned helicopter &quot;Ingenuity&quot; on Mars, humanity&#x27;s first controlled powered aircraft flight on another planet. The helicopter rose to a height of three metres and hovered in a stable holding position for 30 seconds. A video of the flight was made by its accompanying rover, &quot;Perseverance&quot;. 

&quot;Ingenuity&quot;, which was initially designed for five demonstration flights, flew 72 times traveling 11 miles in nearly three years. As a homage to all of its aerial predecessors, it carries a postage stamp sized piece of wing fabric from the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;.

&quot;Ingenuity&#x27;s&quot; last flight was 18 January 2024, a span of since its first takeoff (the duration in Martian days, or sols, was ). Broken and damaged rotor blades suffered during its final landing forced the helicopter&#x27;s retirement.

<text>Schadenfreude (; ; &quot;harm-joy&quot;) is the experience of pleasure, joy, or self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, pain, suffering, or humiliation of another. It is a loanword from German. Schadenfreude has been detected in children as young as 24 months and may be an important social emotion establishing &quot;inequity aversion&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Schadenfreude is a term borrowed from German. It is a compound of (&quot;damage/harm&quot;) and (&quot;joy&quot;). The German word was first mentioned in English texts in 1852 and 1867, and first used in English running text in 1895. In German, it was first attested in the 1740s.
The earliest seems to be Christoph Starke, &quot;Synopsis bibliothecae exegeticae in Vetus Testamentum,&quot; Leipzig, 1750. 
Although common nouns normally are not capitalized in English, schadenfreude sometimes is, following the German convention.

==Psychological causes==
Researchers have found that there are three driving forces behind schadenfreude – aggression, rivalry, and justice.

Self-esteem has a negative relationship with the frequency and intensity of schadenfreude experienced by an individual; individuals with lower self-esteem tend to experience schadenfreude more frequently and intensely.

It is hypothesized that this inverse relationship is mediated through the human psychological inclination to define and protect their self- and in-group- identity or self-conception. Specifically, for someone with high self-esteem, seeing another person fail may still bring them a small (but effectively negligible) surge of confidence because the observer&#x27;s high self-esteem significantly lowers the threat they believe the visibly-failing human poses to their status or identity. Since this confident individual perceives that, regardless of circumstances, the successes and failures of the other person will have little impact on their own status or well-being, they have very little emotional investment in how the other person fares, be it positive or negative.

Conversely, for someone with low self-esteem, someone who is more successful poses a threat to their sense of self, and seeing this person fall can be a source of comfort because they perceive a relative improvement in their internal or in-group standing.

* Aggression-based schadenfreude primarily involves group identity. The joy of observing the suffering of others comes from the observer&#x27;s feeling that the other&#x27;s failure represents an improvement or validation of their own group&#x27;s (in-group) status in relation to external (out-groups) groups (see In-group and out-group). This is, essentially, schadenfreude based on group versus group status. 
*Rivalry-based schadenfreude is individualistic and related to interpersonal competition. It arises from a desire to stand out from and out-perform one&#x27;s peers. This is schadenfreude based on another person&#x27;s misfortune eliciting pleasure because the observer now feels better about their personal identity and self-worth, instead of their group identity.
*Justice-based schadenfreude comes from seeing that behavior seen as immoral or &quot;bad&quot; is punished. It is the pleasure associated with seeing a &quot;bad&quot; person being harmed or receiving retribution. &quot;Schadenfreude&quot; is experienced here because it makes people feel that fairness has been restored for a previously un-punished wrong, and is a type of moral emotion.

== Synonyms ==
&quot;Schadenfreude&quot; has equivalents in many other languages (such as: in Dutch , Swedish , Danish , and Slovak ) but no commonly-used precise English single-word equivalent. There are other ways to express the concept in English.

&quot;Epicaricacy&quot; is a seldom-used direct equivalent, borrowed from Greek &quot;epichairekakia&quot; (ἐπιχαιρεκακία, first attested in Aristotle) from ἐπί &quot;epi&quot; &#x27;upon&#x27;, χαρά &quot;chara&quot; &#x27;joy&#x27;, and κακόν &quot;kakon&quot; &#x27;evil&#x27;.

Tall poppy syndrome is a cultural phenomenon where people of high status are resented, attacked, cut down, or criticized because they have been classified as better than their peers. This is similar to &quot;begrudgery&quot;, the resentment or envy of the success of a peer. If someone were to feel joy by the victim&#x27;s fall from grace, they would be experiencing schadenfreude.

&quot;Roman holiday&quot; is a metaphor from Byron&#x27;s poem &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, where a gladiator in ancient Rome expects to be &quot;butchered to make a Roman holiday&quot; while the audience would take pleasure from watching his suffering. The term suggests debauchery and disorder in addition to sadistic enjoyment.

Morose delectation (), meaning &quot;the habit of dwelling with enjoyment on evil thoughts&quot;, was considered by the medieval church to be a sin. French writer Pierre Klossowski maintained that the appeal of sadism is morose delectation.

&quot;Gloating&quot; is an English word of similar meaning, where &quot;gloat&quot; means &quot;to observe or think about something with triumphant and often malicious satisfaction, gratification, or delight&quot; (e.g., to gloat over an enemy&#x27;s misfortune). Gloating is different from schadenfreude in that it does not necessarily require malice (one may gloat to a friend without ill intent about having defeated him in a game), and that it describes an action rather than a state of mind (one typically gloats to the subject of the misfortune or to a third party). Also, unlike schadenfreude, where the focus is on another&#x27;s misfortune, gloating often brings to mind inappropriately celebrating or bragging about one&#x27;s own good fortune without any particular focus on the misfortune of others.

Permutations of the concept of pleasure at another&#x27;s unhappiness are: pleasure at another&#x27;s happiness, displeasure at another&#x27;s happiness, and displeasure at another&#x27;s unhappiness. Words for these concepts are sometimes cited as antonyms to schadenfreude, as each is the opposite in some way.

There is no common English term for pleasure at another&#x27;s happiness (i.e.; vicarious joy), though terms like &#x27;celebrate&#x27;, &#x27;cheer&#x27;, &#x27;congratulate&#x27;, &#x27;applaud&#x27;, &#x27;rejoice&#x27; or &#x27;kudos&#x27; often describe a shared or reciprocal form of pleasure. The pseudo-German coinage &quot;freudenfreude&quot; is occasionally used in English. The Hebrew slang term &quot;firgun&quot; refers to happiness at another&#x27;s accomplishment.

Displeasure at another&#x27;s happiness is involved in envy, and perhaps in jealousy. The pseudo-German coinage &quot;freudenschade&quot; similarly means sorrow at another&#x27;s success. The correct form would be &quot;Freudenschaden&quot;, since the pseudo-German coinage incorrectly assumes the &quot;n&quot; in &quot;Schadenfreude&quot; to be an interfix and the adjective (&quot;unfortunate&quot;) a noun.

Displeasure at another&#x27;s good fortune is &quot;Gluckschmerz&quot;, a pseudo-German word coined in 1985 as a joke by the pseudonymous Wanda Tinasky; the correct German form would be &quot;Glücksschmerz&quot;. It has since been used in academic contexts.

Displeasure at another&#x27;s unhappiness is sympathy, pity, or compassion.

Sadism gives pleasure through the &quot;infliction&quot; of pain, whereas schadenfreude is pleasure on &quot;observing&quot; misfortune and in particular, the fact that the other somehow deserved the misfortune.

== Neologisms and variants ==
The word &quot;schadenfreude&quot; had been blended with other words to form neologisms as early as 1993, when Lincoln Caplan, in his book &quot;Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire&quot;, used the word &quot;Skaddenfreude&quot; to describe the delight that competitors of Skadden Arps took in its troubles of the early 1990s. Others include &quot;spitzenfreude&quot;, coined by &quot;The Economist&quot; to refer to the fall of Eliot Spitzer, and &quot;Schadenford&quot;, coined by &quot;Toronto Life&quot; in regard to Canadian politician Rob Ford.

== Literary usage and philosophical analysis ==
The Biblical Book of Proverbs mentions an emotion similar to schadenfreude: &quot;Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth: Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.&quot; (Proverbs 24:17–18, King James Version).

In East Asia, the emotion of feeling joy from seeing the hardship of others was described as early as late 4th century BCE. The phrase () first appeared separately as (), meaning the feeling of joy from seeing the hardship of others, and (), meaning the happiness derived from the unfortunate situation of others, in the ancient Chinese text (). The &quot;chengyu&quot; () is still used among Chinese speakers.

In Japanese, the saying exemplifies &quot;schadenfreude&quot;.

In the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, Aristotle used &quot;epikhairekakia&quot; (ἐπιχαιρεκακία in Greek) as part of a triad of terms, in which &quot;epikhairekakia&quot; stands as the opposite of &quot;phthonos&quot; (φθόνος), and &quot;nemesis&quot; (νέμεσις) occupies the mean. &quot;Nemesis&quot; is &quot;a painful response to another&#x27;s undeserved good fortune&quot;, while &quot;phthonos&quot; is a painful response to any good fortune of another, deserved or not. The &quot;epikhairekakos&quot; (ἐπιχαιρέκακος) person takes pleasure in another&#x27;s ill fortune.

Lucretius characterises the emotion in an extended simile in &quot;De rerum natura&quot;: &quot;Suave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis, e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem&quot;, &quot;It is pleasant to watch from the land the great struggle of someone else in a sea rendered great by turbulent winds.&quot; The abbreviated Latin tag &quot;suave mare magno&quot; recalled the passage to generations familiar with the Latin classics.

Caesarius of Heisterbach regards &quot;delight in the adversity of a neighbour&quot; as one of the &quot;daughters of envy... which follows anger&quot; in his &quot;Dialogue on Miracles&quot;.

During the seventeenth century, Robert Burton wrote:

The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer mentioned schadenfreude as the most evil sin of human feeling, famously saying &quot;To feel envy is human, to savor schadenfreude is diabolic.&quot;

The song &quot;Schadenfreude&quot; in the musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, is a comedic exploration of the general public&#x27;s relationship with the emotion.

Rabbi Harold S. Kushner in his book &quot;When Bad Things Happen to Good People&quot; describes schadenfreude as a universal, even wholesome reaction that cannot be helped. &quot;There is a German psychological term, &quot;Schadenfreude&quot;, which refers to the embarrassing reaction of relief we feel when something bad happens to someone else instead of to us.&quot; He gives examples and writes, &quot;[People] don&#x27;t wish their friends ill, but they can&#x27;t help feeling an embarrassing spasm of gratitude that [the bad thing] happened to someone else and not to them.&quot;

Susan Sontag&#x27;s book &quot;Regarding the Pain of Others&quot;, published in 2003, is a study of the issue of how the pain and misfortune of some people affects others, namely whether war photography and war paintings may be helpful as anti-war tools, or whether they only serve some sense of schadenfreude in some viewers.

Philosopher and sociologist Theodor Adorno defined schadenfreude as &quot;... largely unanticipated delight in the suffering of another, which is cognized as trivial and/or appropriate.&quot;

Schadenfreude is steadily becoming a more popular word according to Google.

== Scientific studies ==
A &quot;New York Times&quot; article in 2002 cited a number of scientific studies of schadenfreude, which it defined as &quot;delighting in others&#x27; misfortune&quot;. Many such studies are based on social comparison theory, the idea that when people around us have bad luck, we look better to ourselves. Other researchers have found that people with low self-esteem are more likely to feel schadenfreude than are those who have high self-esteem.

A 2003 study examined intergroup schadenfreude within the context of sports, specifically an international football (soccer) competition. The study focused on the German and Dutch football teams and their fans. The results of this study indicated that the emotion of schadenfreude is very sensitive to circumstances that make it more or less legitimate to feel such malicious pleasure toward a sports rival.

A 2011 study by Cikara and colleagues using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examined schadenfreude among Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees fans, and found that fans showed increased activation in brain areas correlated with self-reported pleasure (ventral striatum) when observing the rival team experience a negative outcome (e.g., a strikeout). By contrast, fans exhibited increased activation in the anterior cingulate and insula when viewing their own team experience a negative outcome.

A 2006 experiment about &quot;justice served&quot; suggests that men, but not women, enjoy seeing &quot;bad people&quot; suffer. The study was designed to measure empathy by watching which brain centers are stimulated when subjects observed via fMRI see someone experiencing physical pain. Researchers expected that the brain&#x27;s empathy center of subjects would show more stimulation when those seen as &quot;good&quot; got an electric shock, than would occur if the shock was given to someone the subject had reason to consider &quot;bad&quot;. This was indeed the case, but for male subjects, the brain&#x27;s pleasure centers also lit up when someone got a shock that the male thought was &quot;well-deserved&quot;.

Brain-scanning studies show that schadenfreude is correlated with envy in subjects. Strong feelings of envy activated physical pain nodes in the brain&#x27;s dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; the brain&#x27;s reward centers, such as the ventral striatum, were activated by news that other people who were envied had suffered misfortune. The magnitude of the brain&#x27;s schadenfreude response could even be predicted from the strength of the previous envy response.

A study conducted in 2009 provides evidence for people&#x27;s capacity to feel schadenfreude in response to negative events in politics. The study was designed to determine whether or not there was a possibility that events containing objective misfortunes might produce schadenfreude. It was reported in the study that the likelihood of experiencing feelings of schadenfreude depends upon whether an individual&#x27;s own party or the opposing party is suffering harm. This study suggests that the domain of politics is prime territory for feelings of schadenfreude, especially for those who identify strongly with their political party.

In 2014, research in the form of an online survey analyzed the relationship between schadenfreude and &#x27;Dark Triad&#x27; traits (i.e. narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy). The findings showed that those respondents who had higher levels of Dark Triad traits also had higher levels of schadenfreude, engaged in greater anti-social activities, and had greater interests in sensationalism.

<doc id="177692" wikidata="Q899485" url="?curid=177692" title="Order in Council">
<text>An Order in Council is a type of legislation in many countries, especially the Commonwealth realms. In the United Kingdom, this legislation is formally made in the name of the monarch by and with the advice and consent of the Privy Council (&quot;King-in-Council&quot;), but in other countries the terminology may vary. Orders-in-Council are distinct from Orders of Council, which are made in the name of the Council without sovereign approval.

==Types, usage and terminology==
There are two principal types of order in council: orders in council whereby the King-in-Council exercises the royal prerogative, and orders in council made in accordance with an act of Parliament.

In the United Kingdom, orders are formally made by the monarch with the advice of the Privy Council (&quot;King-in-Council or Queen-in-Council&quot;). In Canada, federal orders in council are made in the name of the Governor General by the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada; provincial orders-in-council are of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council by the provincial Executive Council. In other places in name of the governor by the executive council (&quot;Governor-in-Council&quot;, &quot;Governor-General-in-Council&quot;, etc.).

In New Zealand, the orders in council, undertaken by the Executive Council, are required to give effect to the government&#x27;s decisions. Apart from acts of Parliament, orders in council are the main method by which the government implements decisions that need legal force.

===Prerogative orders===
An order in council made under the royal prerogative does not depend on any statute for its authority, although an act of Parliament may change this. This type has become less common with the passage of time, as statutes encroach on areas that used to form part of the royal prerogative.

Matters which still fall within the royal prerogative and hence are regulated by (prerogative) orders in council include the prorogation of Parliament, royal charters, and the governance of British Overseas Territories.

British Orders in Council may occasionally be used to effectively reverse court decisions or enforce British law applicable to British Overseas Territories without involving Parliament such as the Caribbean Territories (Abolition of Death Penalty for Murder) Order 1991. Within the United Kingdom itself, court decisions can be formally overruled only by an act of Parliament or by the decision of a higher court on appeal.

In the rest of the Commonwealth they are used to carry out any decisions made by the cabinet and the executive that would not need to be approved by Parliament.

It was long thought that prerogative orders, being primary legislation, were not subject to judicial review. This was reversed in the 1985 case &quot;Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service&quot;, which, however, allowed for some exceptions, such as national security. A given prerogative order therefore may or may not be subject to judicial review, depending on its nature.

===As statutory instruments===
In this second case, an order in council is merely another form of statutory instrument (in the UK, regulated by the Statutory Instruments Act 1946), albeit subject to more formalities than a simple statutory instrument. Like all statutory instruments, they may simply be required to be laid before both Houses of Parliament, or they may be annulled in pursuance of a resolution of either the lower house (House of Commons in the UK and Canada or House of Representatives in the other realms) or the upper house (House of Lords in the UK or Senate in other realms) (&#x27;negative resolution procedure&#x27;), or require to be approved by a resolution of either or, exceptionally, both houses (&#x27;affirmative resolution procedure&#x27;). That said, the use of Orders in Council has been extended more recently, as the Scotland Act 1998 provides that draft Orders in Council may be laid before the Scottish Parliament in certain circumstances in the same way as they would have been laid before the Westminster Parliament. From 2007, legislation put before the Welsh Assembly is enacted through Orders in Council after following the affirmative resolution procedure.

An Order in Council of this type usually has the following form: &quot;His Majesty, in pursuance of [relevant section of primary legislation], is pleased, by and with the advice of His Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows:&quot;

Section 20(1) of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 allows the King in Council to exercise a measure of legislative power in the event of an emergency. 

Other matters dealt with by statutory Orders in Council include the closure of burial grounds under the Burial Act 1853, approval of statutes made by Oxford or Cambridge colleges under the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Act 1923, and the appointment of HM Inspectors of Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills under the Education and Inspections Act 2006.

Under the Government of Wales Act 2006, royal assent to Measures of the National Assembly for Wales was given by Order in Council, but this is not done by statutory instrument but in a form similar to that of a prerogative order. The National Assembly became the Senedd (Welsh Parliament; ) in 2020, at the same time gaining the competence to pass Acts of Senedd Cymru, assent to which is given by letters patent without requiring the involvement of the Privy Council.

====Northern Ireland====

For most of the period from 1972 to 2007, much Northern Ireland legislation was made by order in Council as part of direct rule. This was done under the various Northern Ireland Acts 1974 to 2000, and not by virtue of the royal prerogative.

The use of orders in Council during direct rule is classified as &quot;primary legislation&quot; and not &quot;subordinate legislation&quot; according to section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1998 – subordinate legislation continued to be fulfilled by statutory rules.

==Controversial uses==
===Canada===

After the British Empire entered World War I on the Allied side, an Order in Council was made in Canada for the registration and in certain cases for the internment of aliens of &quot;enemy nationality&quot;. Between 1914 and 1920, 8,579 &quot;enemy aliens&quot; were detained in internment camps.

During the Second World War, the Soviet newspaper &quot;Trud&quot; accused poet and university professor Watson Kirkconnell, who was known to be both a Ukrainophile and a publicist of human rights abuses under Stalinism, of being &quot;the Führer of Canadian Fascism&quot;. It is now well documented that Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King seriously considered acting to protect the Soviet-Canadian military alliance against Nazi Germany by silencing Kirkconnell with an Order-in-Council.

An Order in Council made by the Brian Mulroney government on 21 November 1988 created Amex Bank of Canada, a Canadian banking subsidiary of American Express, although federal banking policy at the time would not ordinarily have permitted such an establishment by a foreign company.

In July 2004 and August 2006, Orders in Council were used to deny a passport to Abdurahman Khadr, a member of the Khadr family who had previously been held in detention by the United States at Guantanamo Bay, on the grounds of national security. The first was overturned on judicial review by the Federal Court as, at the time of his application, national security was not included as a ground for refusal in the &quot;Canadian Passport Order&quot;, which was since amended to include the ground.

In July 2017, the government of Canada used an Order in Council to strip ex-Nazi interpreter Helmut Oberlander of his Canadian citizenship.

On May 1, 2020, an Order in Council was used to declare over 1,500 models of firearm to be prohibited weapons, in response to the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks. The order immediately nullified the existing registrations of ownership for all the weapons it affected, making it illegal for owners to possess, use, transport, or sell them except in a few limited circumstances. A second Order in Council was simultaneously passed declaring an amnesty period until April 30, 2022, in which time owners of newly-prohibited firearms could have them deactivated, destroyed, or exported to a country in which they could be legally owned.The amnesty period had been extended expiring October 30, 2025.

===United Kingdom===
Orders in Council were controversially used in 2004 to overturn a court ruling in the United Kingdom that held that the exile of the Chagossians from the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was unlawful. Initially, the High Court in 2006 held that these Orders in Council were unlawful: &quot;The suggestion that a minister can, through the means of an order in council, exile a whole population from a British Overseas Territory and claim that he is doing so for the &#x27;peace, order and good government&#x27; of the territory is to us repugnant.&quot; The UK government&#x27;s first appeal failed, with the Court of Appeal holding that the decision had been unlawfully taken by a government minister &quot;acting without any constraint&quot;. However, the government successfully appealed to the House of Lords, which overturned the High Court and Court of Appeal decisions (&quot;R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Bancoult (No 2)&quot;). The Law Lords decided that the validity of an order in council made under the prerogative legislating for a colony was amenable to judicial review. Also, it was not for the courts to substitute their judgement for that of the Secretary of State as to what was conducive to the peace, order and good government of the BIOT. The orders were not Wednesbury unreasonable on the facts, given the considerations of security and cost of resettlement. Finally, none of the orders was open to challenge in the British courts on the ground of repugnancy to any fundamental principle relating to the rights of abode of the Chagossians in the Chagos Islands.

<doc id="177694" wikidata="Q1049066" url="?curid=177694" title="Ecological economics">
<text>Ecological economics, bioeconomics, ecolonomy, eco-economics, or ecol-econ is both a transdisciplinary and an interdisciplinary field of academic research addressing the interdependence and coevolution of human economies and natural ecosystems, both intertemporally and spatially. By treating the economy as a subsystem of Earth&#x27;s larger ecosystem, and by emphasizing the preservation of natural capital, the field of ecological economics is differentiated from environmental economics, which is the mainstream economic analysis of the environment. One survey of German economists found that ecological and environmental economics are different schools of economic thought, with ecological economists emphasizing strong sustainability and rejecting the proposition that physical (human-made) capital can substitute for natural capital (see the section on weak versus strong sustainability below).

Ecological economics was founded in the 1980s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on History and development below). The related field of green economics is in general a more politically applied form of the subject.

According to ecological economist , ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of intergenerational equity, irreversibility of environmental change, uncertainty of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation. Ecological economists have questioned fundamental mainstream economic approaches such as cost-benefit analysis, and the separability of economic values from scientific research, contending that economics is unavoidably normative, i.e. prescriptive, rather than positive or descriptive. Positional analysis, which attempts to incorporate time and justice issues, is proposed as an alternative. Ecological economics shares several of its perspectives with feminist economics, including the focus on sustainability, nature, justice and care values. Karl Marx also commented on relationship between capital and ecology, what is now known as ecosocialism.

== History and development ==
The antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the Romantics of the 19th century as well as some Enlightenment political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by Thomas Malthus, while John Stuart Mill predicted the desirability of the &quot;stationary state&quot; of an economy. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the Post–World War II economic expansion. In 1880, Marxian economist Sergei Podolinsky attempted to theorize a labor theory of value based on embodied energy; his work was read and critiqued by Marx and Engels. Otto Neurath developed an ecological approach based on a natural economy whilst employed by the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919. He argued that a market system failed to take into account the needs of future generations, and that a socialist economy required calculation in kind, the tracking of all the different materials, rather than synthesising them into money as a general equivalent. In this he was criticised by neo-liberal economists such as Ludwig von Mises and Freidrich Hayek in what became known as the socialist calculation debate.

The debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to Nobel prize-winning radiochemist Frederick Soddy (1877–1956). In his book &quot;Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt&quot; (1926), Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly.

European predecessors of ecological economics include K. William Kapp (1950) Karl Polanyi (1944), and Romanian economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1971). Georgescu-Roegen, who would later mentor Herman Daly at Vanderbilt University, provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and consumption. His &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The Entropy Law and the Economic Process&quot; (1971), is credited by Daly as a fundamental text of the field, alongside Soddy&#x27;s &quot;Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt&quot;. Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of Kenneth Boulding and E. F. Schumacher, whose book &quot;Small Is Beautiful – A Study of Economics as if People Mattered&quot; (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of Herman Daly&#x27;s comprehensive and persuasive &quot;Steady-State Economics&quot; (1977).

The first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner, with a meeting held in Sweden (including Robert Costanza, Herman Daly, Charles Hall, Bruce Hannon, H.T. Odum, and David Pimentel). Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of &quot;Ecological Modeling&quot; to test the waters. A book entitled &quot;Ecological Economics&quot;, by Joan Martinez Alier, was published later that year. Alier renewed interest in the approach developed by Otto Neurath during the interwar period. The year 1989 saw the foundation of the International Society for Ecological Economics and publication of its journal, &quot;Ecological Economics&quot;, by Elsevier. Robert Costanza was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, which is currently edited by Richard Howarth. Other figures include ecologists C.S. Holling and H.T. Odum, biologist Gretchen Daily, and physicist Robert Ayres. In the Marxian tradition, sociologist John Bellamy Foster and CUNY geography professor David Harvey explicitly center ecological concerns in political economy.

Articles by Inge Ropke (2004, 2005) and Clive Spash (1999) cover the development and modern history of ecological economics and explain its differentiation from resource and environmental economics, as well as some of the controversy between American and European schools of thought. An article by Robert Costanza, David Stern, Lining He, and Chunbo Ma responded to a call by Mick Common to determine the foundational literature of ecological economics by using citation analysis to examine which books and articles have had the most influence on the development of the field. However, citations analysis has itself proven controversial and similar work has been criticized by Clive Spash for attempting to pre-determine what is regarded as influential in ecological economics through study design and data manipulation. In addition, the journal &quot;Ecological Economics&quot; has itself been criticized for swamping the field with mainstream economics.

=== Schools of thought ===
Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the &quot;European Society for Ecological Economics&quot;. An example of the former is the Swedish &quot;Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.&quot; Clive Spash has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories. These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists, and the more radical social ecological economists. International survey work comparing the relevance of the categories for mainstream and heterodox economists shows some clear divisions between environmental and ecological economists. A growing field of radical social-ecological theory is degrowth economics.Degrowth addresses both biophysical limits and global inequality while rejecting neoliberal economics. Degrowth prioritizes grassroots initiatives in progressive socio-ecological goals, adhering to ecological limits by shrinking the human ecological footprint (See Differences from Mainstream Economics Below). It involves an equitable downscale in both production and consumption of resources in order to adhere to biophysical limits. Degrowth draws from Marxian economics, citing the growth of efficient systems as the alienation of nature and man. Economic movements like degrowth reject the idea of growth itself. Some degrowth theorists call for an &quot;exit of the economy&quot;. Critics of the degrowth movement include new resource economists, who point to the gaining momentum of sustainable development. These economists highlight the positive aspects of a green economy, which include equitable access to renewable energy and a commitment to eradicate global inequality through sustainable development (See Green Economics). Examples of heterodox ecological economic experiments include the Catalan Integral Cooperative and the Solidarity Economy Networks in Italy. Both of these grassroots movements use communitarian based economies and consciously reduce their ecological footprint by limiting material growth and adapting to regenerative agriculture.

==== Non-traditional approaches to ecological economics ====
Cultural and heterodox applications of economic interaction around the world have begun to be included as ecological economic practices. E.F. Schumacher introduced examples of non-western economic ideas to mainstream thought in his book, &quot;Small is Beautiful&quot;, where he addresses neoliberal economics through the lens of natural harmony in Buddhist economics. This emphasis on natural harmony is witnessed in diverse cultures across the globe. &quot;Buen Vivir&quot; is a traditional socio-economic movement in South America that rejects the western development model of economics. Meaning G&quot;ood Life&quot;, &quot;Buen Vivir&quot; emphasizes harmony with nature, diverse pluralculturism, coexistence, and inseparability of nature and material. Value is not attributed to material accumulation, and it instead takes a more spiritual and communitarian approach to economic activity. Ecological Swaraj originated out of India, and is an evolving world view of human interactions within the ecosystem. This train of thought respects physical bio-limits and non-human species, pursuing equity and social justice through direct democracy and grassroots leadership. Social well-being is paired with spiritual, physical, and material well-being. These movements are unique to their region, but the values can be seen across the globe in indigenous traditions, such as the Ubuntu Philosophy in South Africa.

=== Differences from mainstream economics ===
Ecological economics differs from mainstream economics in that it heavily reflects on the ecological footprint of human interactions in the economy. This footprint is measured by the impact of human activities on natural resources and the waste generated in the process. Ecological economists aim to minimize the ecological footprint, taking into account the scarcity of global and regional resources and their accessibility to an economy. Some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical capital asset analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists use tools from mathematical economics, as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle. As ecological economists try to minimize these potential disasters, calculating the fallout of environmental destruction becomes a humanitarian issue as well. Already, the Global South has seen trends of mass migration due to environmental changes. Climate refugees from the Global South are adversely affected by changes in the environment, and some scholars point to global wealth inequality within the current neoliberal economic system as a source of this issue.

The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is tropical rainforest ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of Ecuador. While this area has substantial deposits of bitumen it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes – most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen. Effectively, the instructional capital of the genomes is undervalued by analyses that view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the carbon credit for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive (&quot;dirty&quot;) bitumen in the ground is also valued – the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.

While this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment. Critiques concern the need to create a more meaningful relationship with Nature and the non-human world than evident in the instrumentalism of shallow ecology and the environmental economists commodification of everything external to the market system.

== Nature and ecology ==

A simple circular flow of income diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of production. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an &quot;environment&#x27;s source function&quot;, and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The &quot;sink function&quot; describes an environment&#x27;s ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs. Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing &quot;cumulative pollutants&quot;. Pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem.

The economic value of natural capital and ecosystem services is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms. Ecological economist Robert Costanza led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in &quot;Nature&quot;, the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global GDP was $27 trillion). Half of the value went to nutrient cycling. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in &quot;Ecological Economics&quot; Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.

The Earth&#x27;s carrying capacity is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as Thomas Malthus pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study &quot;Limits to Growth&quot;. Diminishing returns suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as erosion, an impending water crisis, and soil salinity (from irrigation) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that industrial agriculture, which exacerbates these problems, is not sustainable agriculture, and are generally inclined favorably to organic farming, which also reduces the output of carbon.

Global wild fisheries are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that salmon farming has major negative impacts on wild salmon, as well as the forage fish that need to be caught to feed them.

Since animals are higher on the trophic level, they are less efficient sources of food energy. Reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food, but as nations develop, they tend to adopt high-meat diets similar to that of the United States. Genetically modified food (GMF) a conventional solution to the problem, presents numerous problems – Bt corn produces its own &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; toxin/protein, but the pest resistance is believed to be only a matter of time.

Global warming is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies expressing agreement on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an energy crisis. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained – the Stern report is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of discounting and intergenerational equity.

== Ethics ==
Mainstream economics has attempted to become a value-free &#x27;hard science&#x27;, but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of utility, efficiency, and cost-benefits such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for sustainable development, and may have goals similar to green politics.

=== Green economics ===
In international, regional, and national policy circles, the concept of the &quot;green economy&quot; grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development.

The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) defines a &#x27;green economy&#x27; as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high-salary jobs. In 2011, its definition was further developed as the word &#x27;green&#x27; is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well-organized but also impartial, guaranteeing an objective shift to an economy that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive.

The ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective, resourceful, environment-friendly and resource‐saving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change, at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation.

As an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development, the Green Economy adherents robustly promote good governance. To boost local investments and foreign ventures, it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere. Likewise, such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable. In the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure, the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant. In achieving a green economy, competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies, guidelines, campaigns, and programmes.

Shifting to a Green Economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business. It likewise necessitates new capacities, skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors, and able to work as effective components within multi-disciplinary teams. To achieve this goal, vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors. Simultaneously, the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines.

== Topics ==
Among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology, allocation of resources, weak versus strong sustainability, energy economics, energy accounting and balance, environmental services, cost shifting, modeling, and monetary policy.

=== Methodology ===

A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the laws of thermodynamics) and in knowledge of biological systems. It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. Richard B. Norgaard argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book &quot;Development Betrayed&quot;.

Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the &#x27;new welfare economics&#x27; from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics. This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.

Ecological economics is distinguishable from neoclassical economics primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that neoclassical economics has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.

The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and ecosystem services directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.

There has then been a move to regard such things as natural capital and ecosystems functions as goods and services. However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity. This has been referred to as ecologists &#x27;selling out on Nature&#x27;. There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in environmental ethics about how to structure a plural value system.

=== Allocation of resources ===

Resource and neoclassical economics focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics: distribution (equity), and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies. Ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the quality of life), while arguing that neoclassical economics confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels, increased per-capita consumption (the typical economic measure of &quot;standard of living&quot;) may not always lead to improvement in human well-being, but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being. This situation is sometimes referred to as uneconomic growth (see diagram above).

=== Weak versus strong sustainability ===


Ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources, claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human-made capital—labor and technology.

The impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun&#x27;s energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).

The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.
There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of Robert Solow and Martin Weitzman, at one extreme and the &#x27;entropy pessimists&#x27;, notably Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly, at the other.

Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital. This is known as the weak sustainability view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.

At the other extreme, the strong sustainability view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable. From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that economic policy has a fiduciary responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.

Recently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a &#x27;middle way&#x27; by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.

=== Energy economics ===
A key concept of energy economics is net energy gain, which recognizes that all energy sources require an initial energy investment in order to produce energy. To be useful the energy return on energy invested (EROEI) has to be greater than one. The net energy gain from the production of coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted. In traditional energy economics, surplus energy is often seen as something to be capitalized on—either by storing for future use or by converting it into economic growth. 

Ecological economics generally rejects the view of energy economics that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well-being, focusing instead on biodiversity and creativity – or natural capital and individual capital, in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of uneconomic growth and quality of life. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this. When considering surplus energy, ecological economists state this could be used for activities that do not directly contribute to economic productivity but instead enhance societal and environmental well-being. This concept of dépense, as developed by Georges Bataille, offers a novel perspective on the management of surplus energy within economies. This concept encourages a shift from growth-centric models to approaches that prioritise sustainable and meaningful expenditures of excess resources. 

Thermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood through the second law of thermodynamics, but also in terms of such economic criteria as productivity, efficiency, and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work. As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.

Exergy analysis is performed in the field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently. The term &quot;exergy&quot;, was coined by Zoran Rant in 1956, but the concept was developed by J. Willard Gibbs. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, systems ecology, and energetics.

=== Energy accounting and balance ===
An energy balance can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of thermodynamics, to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues. The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus work done, and transformations within the system.

Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.

=== Ecosystem services and their valuation ===

Ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings, playing a key role in producing well-being. At the same time, there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits.

A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues to determine the &#x27;value&#x27; of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context. Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total GDP of the world at the time of the study. This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some environmental economists – for being inconsistent with assumptions of financial capital valuation – and ecological economists – for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators.

The whole idea of treating ecosystems as goods and services to be valued in monetary terms remains controversial. A common objection is that life is precious or priceless, but this demonstrably degrades to it being worthless within cost-benefit analysis and other standard economic methods. Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of insurance or wages. One example of this in practice is the value of a statistical life, which is a dollar value assigned to one life used to evaluate the costs of small changes in risk to life–such as exposure to one pollutant. Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services. In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks. Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.

Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing ecosystem valuation. Biodiversity measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard. The growing field of biodiversity finance began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal or similar ones in the Congo. US news outlets treated the stories as a &quot;threat&quot; to &quot;drill a park&quot; reflecting a previously dominant view that NGOs and governments had the primary responsibility to protect ecosystems. However Peter Barnes and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm.

Commodification of other ecological relations as in carbon credit and direct payments to farmers to preserve ecosystem services are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity, but is also controversial in ecological economics. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization achieved near-universal agreement in 2008 that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging permaculture were the only practical way out of a food crisis. The holdouts were all English-speaking countries that export GMOs and promote &quot;free trade&quot; agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network: The US, UK, Canada and Australia.

=== Not &#x27;externalities&#x27;, but cost shifting ===

Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling &quot;externalities&quot; is not warranted. Joan Martinez Alier, for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet. The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by David Pearce and by the recent Stern Report (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as Clive Spash).

Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman Paul Hawken argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations. These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in &quot;Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution&quot;.

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning. Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by Karl William Kapp explains why the concept of &quot;externality&quot; is a misnomer. In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits. Charles Eisenstein has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive. As social ecological economist Clive Spash has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system. Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed &#x27;externalities&#x27;.

=== Ecological-economic modeling ===

Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include: evolutionary, input-output, neo-Austrian modeling, entropy and thermodynamic models, multi-criteria, and agent-based modeling, the environmental Kuznets curve, and Stock-Flow consistent model frameworks. System dynamics and GIS are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling. The Matrix accounting methods of Christian Felber provide a more sophisticated method for identifying &quot;the common good&quot;

=== Monetary theory and policy ===
Ecological economics draws upon its work on resource allocation and strong sustainability to address monetary policy. Drawing upon a transdisciplinary literature, ecological economics roots its policy work in monetary theory and its goals of sustainable scale, just distribution, and efficient allocation. Ecological economics&#x27; work on monetary theory and policy can be traced to Frederick Soddy&#x27;s work on money. The field considers questions such as the growth imperative of interest-bearing debt, the nature of money, and alternative policy proposals such as alternative currencies and public banking.

== Criticism ==

Assigning monetary value to natural resources such as biodiversity, and the emergent ecosystem services is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making. While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false.
McCauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful. He describes four main problems with this approach:

Firstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as coastal protection from hurricanes by mangroves for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting cattle. The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.
Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to devaluation of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former coffee plantations in Finca Santa Fe, Costa Rica. The pollination services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple. Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.

Thirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of technology is about how Humanity developed artificial alternatives to nature&#x27;s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of ecosystem services.

Lastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the Nile perch to Lake Victoria, the ecological consequence was decimation of native fauna. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.

McCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for monetary reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.

<text>Energy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to supply and use of energy in societies. Considering the cost of energy services and associated value gives economic meaning to the efficiency at which energy can be produced. Energy services can be defined as functions that generate and provide energy to the “desired end services or states”. The efficiency of energy services is dependent on the engineered technology used to produce and supply energy. The goal is to minimise energy input required (e.g. kWh, mJ, see Units of Energy) to produce the energy service, such as lighting (lumens), heating (temperature) and fuel (natural gas). The main sectors considered in energy economics are transportation and building, although it is relevant to a broad scale of human activities, including households and businesses at a microeconomic level and resource management and environmental impacts at a macroeconomic level.

==History==

Energy related issues have been actively present in economic literature since the 1973 oil crisis, but have their roots much further back in the history. As early as 1865, W.S. Jevons expressed his concern about the eventual depletion of coal resources in his book &quot;The Coal Question&quot;. One of the best known early attempts to work on the economics of exhaustible resources (incl. fossil fuel) was made by H. Hotelling, who derived a price path for non-renewable resources, known as Hotelling&#x27;s rule.

Development of energy economics theory over the last two centuries can be attributed to three main economic subjects – the rebound effect, the energy efficiency gap and more recently, &#x27;green nudges&#x27;.

The Rebound Effect (1860s to 1930s)

While energy efficiency is improved with new technology, expected energy savings are less-than proportional to the efficiency gains due to behavioural responses. There are three behavioural sub-theories to be considered: the &quot;direct rebound effect&quot;, which anticipates increased use of the energy service that was improved; the &quot;indirect rebound effect&quot;, which considers an increased income effect created by savings then allowing for increased energy consumption, and; the &quot;economy-wide effect&quot;, which results from an increase in energy prices due to the newly developed technology improvements.

The Energy Efficiency Gap (1980s to 1990s)

Suboptimal investment in improvement of energy efficiency resulting from market failures/barriers prevents the optimal use of energy. From an economical standpoint, a rational decision-maker with perfect information will optimally choose between the trade-off of initial investment and energy costs. However, due to uncertainties such as environmental externalities, the optimal potential energy efficiency is not always able to be achieved, thus creating an energy efficiency gap.

Green Nudges (1990s to Current)

While the energy efficiency gap considers economical investments, it does not consider behavioural anomalies in energy consumers. Growing concerns surrounding climate change and other environmental impacts have led to what economists would describe as irrational behaviours being exhibited by energy consumers. A contribution to this has been government interventions, coined &quot;green nudges’ by Thaler and Sustein (2008), such as feedback on energy bills. Now that it is realised people do not behave rationally, research into energy economics is more focused on behaviours and impacting decision-making to close the energy efficiency gap.

==Economic factors==
Due to diversity of issues and methods applied and shared with a number of academic disciplines, energy economics does not present itself as a self-contained academic discipline, but it is an applied subdiscipline of economics. From the list of main topics of economics, some relate strongly to energy economics:

* Computable general equilibrium
* Econometrics
* Environmental economics
* Finance
* Industrial organization
* Input–output model
* Microeconomics
* Macroeconomics
* Operations research
* Resource economics

Energy economics also draws heavily on results of energy engineering, geology, political sciences, ecology etc. Recent focus of energy economics includes the following issues:

* Climate change and climate policy
* Demand response
* Elasticity of supply and demand in energy market
* Energy and economic growth
* Energy derivatives
* Energy elasticity
* Energy forecasting
* Energy markets and electricity markets - liberalisation, (de- or re-) regulation
* energy infrastructure
* Environmental policy
* Sustainability
Some institutions of higher education (universities) recognise energy economics as a viable career opportunity, offering this as a curriculum. The University of Cambridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam are the top three research universities, and Resources for the Future the top research institute. There are numerous other research departments, companies, and professionals offering energy economics studies and consultations.

==International Association for Energy Economics==
International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE) is an international non-profit society of professionals interested in energy economics. IAEE was founded in 1977, during the period of the energy crisis. IAEE is incorporated under United States laws and has headquarters in Cleveland.

The IAEE operates through a 17-member Council of elected and appointed members. Council and officer members serve in a voluntary position.

IAEE has over 4,500 members worldwide (in over 100 countries). There are more than 25 national chapters, in countries where membership exceeds 25 individual members. Some of the regularly active national chapters of the IAEE are; USAEE - United States; GEE - Germany; BIEE - Great Britain; AEE - France; AIEE - Italy.

=== Publications ===
The International Association for Energy Economics publishes three publications throughout the year:

* &quot;The Energy Journal&quot;, a quarterly academic publication 
* the &quot;Economics of Energy &amp; Environmental Policy,&quot; a semi-annual publication
* the &quot;Energy Forum&quot;

=== Conferences ===
The IAEE conferences address critical issues of vital concern and importance to governments and industries and provide a forum where policy issues are presented, considered and discussed at both formal sessions and informal social functions.

IAEE typically holds five Conferences each year. The main annual conference for IAEE is the &quot;IAEE International Conference&quot; which is organized at diverse locations around the world. From the year 1996 on these conferences have taken place (or will take place) in the following cities:

* 2021 - Online Conference
* 2020 - No Conference
* 2019 - Montreal, Canada
* 2018 - Groningen, The Netherlands.
* 2017 - Singapore.

<text>St. Thomas University (also St. Thomas or STU) is a Catholic, English-language liberal arts university located in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. It is a primarily undergraduate university offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the arts (humanities and social sciences), education, and social work to approximately 1,900 students. The average class size is 30 and no class is larger than 60.

The university offers recognized majors in Criminology, Journalism, Human Rights, and Communications and Public Policy. St. Thomas is the home of the Frank McKenna Centre for Communications and Public Policy. The university is unique in Canada for its sole focus on liberal arts and its commitment to social justice.

St. Thomas&#x27; notable alumni includes a Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney, a New Brunswick premier, Shawn Graham, federal and provincial cabinet ministers, prelates, university presidents as well as several Rhodes Scholars.

==History==
St. Thomas University acknowledges the land in which the school is built on as traditional territory of Indigenous communities. These communities include the Wolastoqiyik / Maliseet, and the Mi&#x27;Kmaw, and Passamaquoddy / Peskotomuhkati Tribes / Nations, who signed peace treaties with the British Crown in the 1700s.

St. Thomas University traces its institutional origins to the establishment of a Catholic academy in the former community of Chatham, New Brunswick (now Miramichi) in the late nineteenth century. Due to an influx of Irish immigration in northwestern New Brunswick, Chatham saw a need for more centers of education and religious instruction. Officially opened in October 1860, St. Michael&#x27;s Academy was inaugurated by Bishop James Rogers of the newly formed Diocese of Chatham.

St. Michael&#x27;s Academy catered to young English-speaking males in the Miramichi River Valley and the growing port town of Chatham. A women&#x27;s academy was created a year later. St. Michael&#x27;s consisted of a single wooden structure constructed near the seat of the Diocese of Chatham, the new St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral. The institution offered a classical education and was intended to prepare students to study for the diocesan priesthood. From 1865, the school was known as St. Michael&#x27;s College. It closed for several years in the 1870s and 1880s.

Its uneven operation was curbed by the Basilian Fathers, a religious order who assumed the administration of the College in 1910. Since the Toronto-based religious order already had a Catholic college in the Ontario capital, named St. Michael&#x27;s College (a federated component of the University of Toronto), St. Michael&#x27;s in Chatham was renamed St. Thomas College after Thomas Aquinas. It remained a high school and a junior college; however, in 1934, the institution gained degree-granting status from the Government of New Brunswick.

After 1923, the Basilian Fathers transferred the administration of the college to the Diocese of Chatham. The diocese was restructured as the Diocese of Bathurst. Its seat was moved to the primarily francophone community, Bathurst, north of Chatham. While St. Thomas College remained in Chatham, its future remained uncertain. In 1959, the college was subject to territorial changes in the reorganized Diocese of Bathurst. English-speaking parishes and the college were transferred to the Diocese of Saint John with its seat in New Brunswick&#x27;s major port city. The Bishop of Saint John became the Chancellor of St. Thomas. By mid-century, the economic and social significance of post-secondary institutions saw an increased role of state intervention. In 1960, the institution was renamed St. Thomas University by an act of the New Brunswick Legislature. Under the government of Louis Robichaud, the Royal Commission on Higher Education was launched. Headed by John James Deutsch, a professor and administrator from Queen&#x27;s University, the commission recommended greater centralization and public funding in post-secondary education.

Arising from the Commission&#x27;s recommendations, St. Thomas University was encouraged to relocate to the campus of the University of New Brunswick in Fredericton to share facilities. Not without controversy and animosity, St. Thomas University moved to the provincial capital and abandoned its secondary school curriculum. A new campus was built in the Neo-Georgian style by the architects of the University of New Brunswick (Larson &amp; Larson) to complement the campus of its institutional neighbour. It officially welcomed students in October 1964.

==Relationship with UNB==

St. Thomas University and the University of New Brunswick&#x27;s Fredericton campus are located in the College Hill neighbourhood in Fredericton. The two institutions share facilities for their student unions, libraries, athletics, and a common heating plant and building maintenance services. Students from STU are permitted to take a certain number of classes at UNB and vice versa. However, STU and UNBF itself are financially and academically separate. STU is able to offer many amenities other smaller schools cannot, in large part to its UNB partnership. The two universities enjoy a good-natured rivalry.

==Academics==

STU offers the following programs: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Applied Arts, Bachelor of Education, Bachelor of Social Work, and a Bachelor of Arts Aviation Stream.

==Athletics==
STU offers athletic programs for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cross-country, soccer, and volleyball, as well as women&#x27;s rugby and hockey.
Collectively, the Tommies have won 41 ACAA titles and 3 AUS titles. Student-athletes have achieved 404 CCAA National Scholar and 417 U Sports Academic All-Canadian awards.

STU participated in AUS men&#x27;s hockey until 2016 (winning the championships in 1961 and 2001), and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field from 2011-2022.

==Campus life==

There are six academic buildings on campus housing classrooms and faculty offices: James Dunn Hall, Edmund Casey Hall, George Martin Hall, Brian Mulroney Hall, Holy Cross House, and Margaret Norrie McCain Hall. Additionally, there are three residence buildings at St. Thomas University, all located on campus: Harrington Hall, Vanier Hall, and Holy Cross House. 

The university maintains its own campus police force, comprised by students hired annually by the University to maintain security at campus events. The student newspaper, &quot;The Aquinian&quot;, is available on campus and throughout the city during the regular academic year.

<text>Behavioral economics is the study of the psychological (e.g. cognitive, behavioral, affective, social) factors involved in the decisions of individuals or institutions, and how these decisions deviate from those implied by traditional economic theory.

Behavioral economics is primarily concerned with the bounds of rationality of economic agents. Behavioral models typically integrate insights from psychology, neuroscience and microeconomic theory.

Behavioral economics began as a distinct field of study in the 1970s and 1980s, but can be traced back to 18th-century economists, such as Adam Smith, who deliberated how the economic behavior of individuals could be influenced by their desires.

The status of behavioral economics as a subfield of economics is a fairly recent development; the breakthroughs that laid the foundation for it were published through the last three decades of the 20th century. Behavioral economics is still growing as a field, being used increasingly in research and in teaching.

== History ==
Early classical economists included psychological reasoning in much of their writing, though psychology at the time was not a recognized field of study. In &quot;The Theory of Moral Sentiments,&quot; Adam Smith wrote on concepts later popularized by modern Behavioral Economic theory, such as loss aversion. Jeremy Bentham, a Utilitarian philosopher in the 1700s conceptualized utility as a product of psychology. Other economists who incorporated psychological explanations in their works included Francis Edgeworth, Vilfredo Pareto and Irving Fisher.

A rejection and elimination of psychology from economics in the early 1900s brought on a period defined by a reliance on empiricism. There was a lack of confidence in hedonic theories, which saw pursuance of maximum benefit as an essential aspect in understanding human economic behavior. Hedonic analysis had shown little success in predicting human behavior, leading many to question its viability as a reliable source for prediction.

There was also a fear among economists that the involvement of psychology in shaping economic models was inordinate and a departure from accepted principles. They feared that an increased emphasis on psychology would undermine the mathematic components of the field.

To boost the ability of economics to predict accurately, economists started looking to tangible phenomena rather than theories based on human psychology. Psychology was seen as unreliable to many of these economists as it was a new field, not regarded as sufficiently scientific. Though a number of scholars expressed concern towards the positivism within economics, models of study dependent on psychological insights became rare. Economists instead conceptualized humans as purely rational and self-interested decision makers, illustrated in the concept of &quot;homo economicus.&quot;

The resurgence of psychology within economics, which facilitated the expansion of behavioral economics, has been linked to the cognitive revolution. In the 1960s, cognitive psychology began to shed more light on the brain as an information processing device (in contrast to behaviorist models). Psychologists in this field, such as Ward Edwards, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman began to compare their cognitive models of decision-making under risk and uncertainty to economic models of rational behavior. These developments spurred economists to reconsider how psychology could be applied to economic models and theories. Concurrently, the Expected utility hypothesis and discounted utility models began to gain acceptance. In challenging the accuracy of generic utility, these concepts established a practice foundational in behavioral economics: Building on standard models by applying psychological knowledge.

Mathematical psychology reflects a long-standing interest in preference transitivity and the measurement of utility.

=== Development of Behavioral Economics ===
In 2017, Niels Geiger, a lecturer in economics at the University of Hohenheim conducted an investigation into the proliferation of behavioral economics. Geiger&#x27;s research looked at studies that had quantified the frequency of references to terms specific to behavioral economics, and how often influential papers in behavioral economics were cited in journals on economics. The quantitative study found that there was a significant spread in behavioral economics after Kahneman and Tversky&#x27;s work in the 1990s and into the 2000s.
== Bounded rationality ==

Bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the tractability of the decision problem, their cognitive limitations and the time available.

Herbert A. Simon proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision-making. It complements &quot;rationality as optimization&quot;, which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available. Simon used the analogy of a pair of scissors, where one blade represents human cognitive limitations and the other the &quot;structures of the environment&quot;, illustrating how minds compensate for limited resources by exploiting known structural regularity in the environment. Bounded rationality implicates the idea that humans take shortcuts that may lead to suboptimal decision-making. Behavioral economists engage in mapping the decision shortcuts that agents use in order to help increase the effectiveness of human decision-making. Bounded rationality finds that actors do not assess all available options appropriately, in order to save on search and deliberation costs. As such decisions are not always made in the sense of greatest self-reward as limited information is available. Instead agents shall choose to settle for an acceptable solution. One approach, adopted by Richard M. Cyert and March in their 1963 book A Behavioral Theory of the Firm, was to view firms as coalitions of groups whose targets were based on satisficing rather than optimizing behaviour. Another treatment of this idea comes from Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler&#x27;s &quot;Nudge&quot;. Sunstein and Thaler recommend that choice architectures are modified in light of human agents&#x27; bounded rationality. A widely cited proposal from Sunstein and Thaler urges that healthier food be placed at sight level in order to increase the likelihood that a person will opt for that choice instead of less healthy option. Some critics of &quot;Nudge&quot; have lodged attacks that modifying choice architectures will lead to people becoming worse decision-makers.

== Prospect theory ==

In 1979, Kahneman and Tversky published &quot;Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk&quot;, that used cognitive psychology to explain various divergences of economic decision making from neo-classical theory. Kahneman and Tversky utilising prospect theory determined three generalisations; gains are treated differently than losses, outcomes received with certainty are overweighed relative to uncertain outcomes and the structure of the problem may affect choices. These arguments were supported in part by altering a survey question so that it was no longer a case of achieving gains but averting losses and the majority of respondents altered their answers accordingly. In essence proving that emotions such as fear of loss, or greed can alter decisions, indicating the presence of an irrational decision-making process. Prospect theory has two stages: an editing stage and an evaluation stage. In the editing stage, risky situations are simplified using various heuristics. In the evaluation phase, risky alternatives are evaluated using various psychological principles that include:

*Reference dependence: When evaluating outcomes, the decision maker considers a &quot;reference level&quot;. Outcomes are then compared to the reference point and classified as &quot;gains&quot; if greater than the reference point and &quot;losses&quot; if less than the reference point.
* Loss aversion: Losses are avoided more than equivalent gains are sought. In their 1992 paper, Kahneman and Tversky found the median coefficient of loss aversion to be about 2.25, i.e., losses hurt about 2.25 times more than equivalent gains reward.
* Non-linear probability weighting: Decision makers overweigh small probabilities and underweigh large probabilities—this gives rise to the inverse-S shaped &quot;probability weighting function&quot;.
* Diminishing sensitivity to gains and losses: As the size of the gains and losses relative to the reference point increase in absolute value, the marginal effect on the decision maker&#x27;s utility or satisfaction falls.

In 1992, in the &quot;Journal of Risk and Uncertainty&quot;, Kahneman and Tversky gave a revised account of prospect theory that they called cumulative prospect theory. The new theory eliminated the editing phase in prospect theory and focused just on the evaluation phase. Its main feature was that it allowed for non-linear probability weighting in a cumulative manner, which was originally suggested in John Quiggin&#x27;s rank-dependent utility theory. Psychological traits such as overconfidence, projection bias and the effects of limited attention are now part of the theory. Other developments include a conference at the University of Chicago, a special behavioral economics edition of the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Economics&quot; (&quot;In Memory of Amos Tversky&quot;), and Kahneman&#x27;s 2002 Nobel Prize for having &quot;integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty.&quot;

A further argument of Behavioural Economics relates to the impact of the individual&#x27;s cognitive limitations as a factor in limiting the rationality of people&#x27;s decisions. Sloan first argued this in his paper &#x27;Bounded Rationality&#x27; where he stated that our cognitive limitations are somewhat the consequence of our limited ability to foresee the future, hampering the rationality of decision. Daniel Kahneman further expanded upon the effect cognitive ability and processes have on decision making in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow Kahneman delved into two forms of thought, fast thinking which he considered &quot;operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control&quot;. Conversely, slow thinking is the allocation of cognitive ability, choice and concentration. Fast thinking utilises heuristics, which is a decision-making process that undertakes shortcuts, and rules of thumb to provide an immediate but often irrational and imperfect solution. Kahneman proposed that the result of the shortcuts is the occurrence of a number of biases such as hindsight bias, confirmation bias and outcome bias among others. A key example of fast thinking and the resultant irrational decisions is the 2008 financial crisis.

== Nudge theory ==

Nudge is a concept in behavioral science, political theory and economics which proposes designs or changes in decision environments as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals—in other words, it&#x27;s &quot;a way to manipulate people&#x27;s choices to lead them to make specific decisions&quot;.

The first formulation of the term and associated principles was developed in cybernetics by James Wilk before 1995 and described by Brunel University academic D. J. Stewart as &quot;the art of the nudge&quot; (sometimes referred to as micronudges). It also drew on methodological influences from clinical psychotherapy tracing back to Gregory Bateson, including contributions from Milton Erickson, Watzlawick, Weakland and Fisch, and Bill O&#x27;Hanlon. In this variant, the nudge is a microtargeted design geared towards a specific group of people, irrespective of the scale of intended intervention.

In 2008, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein&#x27;s book &quot;Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness&quot; brought nudge theory to prominence. It also gained a following among US and UK politicians, in the private sector and in public health. The authors refer to influencing behavior without coercion as libertarian paternalism and the influencers as choice architects. Thaler and Sunstein defined their concept as:

Nudging techniques aim to capitalise on the judgemental heuristics of people. In other words, a nudge alters the environment so that when heuristic, or System 1, decision-making is used, the resulting choice will be the most positive or desired outcome. An example of such a nudge is switching the placement of junk food in a store, so that fruit and other healthy options are located next to the cash register, while junk food is relocated to another part of the store.

In 2008, the United States appointed Sunstein, who helped develop the theory, as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

Notable applications of nudge theory include the formation of the British Behavioural Insights Team in 2010. It is often called the &quot;Nudge Unit&quot;, at the British Cabinet Office, headed by David Halpern. In addition, the Penn Medicine Nudge Unit is the world&#x27;s first behavioral design team embedded within a health system.

Nudge theory has also been applied to business management and corporate culture, such as in relation to health, safety and environment (HSE) and human resources. Regarding its application to HSE, one of the primary goals of nudge is to achieve a &quot;zero accident culture&quot;.

=== Criticisms ===

Cass Sunstein has responded to critiques at length in his &quot;The Ethics of Influence&quot; making the case in favor of nudging against charges that nudges diminish autonomy, threaten dignity, violate liberties, or reduce welfare. Ethicists have debated this rigorously. These charges have been made by various participants in the debate from Bovens to Goodwin. Wilkinson for example charges nudges for being manipulative, while others such as Yeung question their scientific credibility.

Some, such as Hausman &amp; Welch have inquired whether nudging should be permissible on grounds of (distributive) justice; Lepenies &amp; Malecka have questioned whether nudges are compatible with the rule of law. Similarly, legal scholars have discussed the role of nudges and the law.

Behavioral economists such as Bob Sugden have pointed out that the underlying normative benchmark of nudging is still homo economicus, despite the proponents&#x27; claim to the contrary.

It has been remarked that nudging is also a euphemism for psychological manipulation as practiced in social engineering.

There exists an anticipation and, simultaneously, implicit criticism of the nudge theory in works of Hungarian social psychologists who emphasize the active participation in the nudge of its target (Ferenc Merei and Laszlo Garai).

== Concepts ==
Behavioral economics aims to improve or overhaul traditional economic theory by studying failures in its assumptions that people are rational and selfish. Specifically, it studies the biases, tendencies and heuristics of people&#x27;s economic decisions. It aids in determining whether people make good choices and whether they could be helped to make better choices. It can be applied both before and after a decision is made.

=== Search heuristics ===

Behavioral economics proposes search heuristics as an aid for evaluating options. It is motivated by the fact that it is costly to gain information about options and it aims to maximise the utility of searching for information. While each heuristic is not wholistic in its explanation of the search process alone, a combination of these heuristics may be used in the decision-making process. There are three primary search heuristics.

Satisficing

Satisficing is the idea that there is some minimum requirement from the search and once that has been met, stop searching. After satisficing, a person may not have the most optimal option (i.e. the one with the highest utility), but would have a &quot;good enough&quot; one. This heuristic may be problematic if the aspiration level is set at such a level that no products exist that could meet the requirements.

Directed cognition

Directed cognition is a search heuristic in which a person treats each opportunity to research information as their last. Rather than a contingent plan that indicates what will be done based on the results of each search, directed cognition considers only if one more search should be conducted and what alternative should be researched.

Elimination by aspects

Whereas satisficing and directed cognition compare choices, elimination by aspects compares certain qualities. A person using the elimination by aspects heuristic first chooses the quality that they value most in what they are searching for and sets an aspiration level. This may be repeated to refine the search. i.e. identify the second most valued quality and set an aspiration level. Using this heuristic, options will be eliminated as they fail to meet the minimum requirements of the chosen qualities.

=== Heuristics and cognitive effects ===
Besides searching, behavioral economists and psychologists have identified other heuristics and other cognitive effects that affect people&#x27;s decision making. These include:

Mental accounting

Mental accounting refers to the propensity to allocate resources for specific purposes. Mental accounting is a behavioral bias that causes one to separate money into different categories known as mental accounts either based on the source or the intention of the money.

Anchoring

Anchoring describes when people have a mental reference point with which they compare results to. For example, a person who anticipates that the weather on a particular day would be raining, but finds that on the day it is actually clear blue skies, would gain more utility from the pleasant weather because they anticipated that it would be bad.

Herd behavior

This is a relatively simple bias that reflects the tendency of people to mimic what everyone else is doing and follow the general consensus.

Framing effects

People tend to choose differently depending on how the options are presented to them. People tend to have little control over their susceptibility to the framing effect, as often their choice-making process is based on intuition.

=== Biases and fallacies ===

While heuristics are tactics or mental shortcuts to aid in the decision-making process, people are also affected by a number of biases and fallacies. Behavioral economics identifies a number of these biases that negatively affect decision making such as:

Present bias

Present bias reflects the human tendency to want rewards sooner. It describes people who are more likely to forego a greater payoff in the future in favour of receiving a smaller benefit sooner. An example of this is a smoker who is trying to quit. Although they know that in the future they will suffer health consequences, the immediate gain from the nicotine hit is more favourable to a person affected by present bias. Present bias is commonly split into people who are aware of their present bias (sophisticated) and those who are not (naive).

Gambler&#x27;s fallacy

The gambler&#x27;s fallacy stems from law of small numbers. It is the belief that an event that has occurred often in the past is less likely to occur in the future, despite the probability remaining constant. For example, if a coin had been flipped three times and turned up heads every single time, a person influenced by the gambler&#x27;s fallacy would predict that the next one ought to be tails because of the abnormal number of heads flipped in the past, even though the probability of a heads occurring is still 50%.

Hot hand fallacy

The hot hand fallacy is the opposite of the gambler&#x27;s fallacy. It is the belief that an event that has occurred often in the past is more likely to occur again in the future such that the streak will continue. This fallacy is particularly common within sports. For example, if a football team has consistently won the last few games they have participated in, then it is often said that they are &#x27;on form&#x27; and thus, it is expected that the football team will maintain their winning streak.

Narrative fallacy

Narrative fallacy refers to when people use narratives to connect the dots between random events to make sense of arbitrary information. The term stems from Nassim Taleb&#x27;s book &quot;The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable&quot;. The narrative fallacy can be problematic as it can lead to individuals making false cause-effect relationships between events. For example, a startup may get funding because investors are swayed by a narrative that sounds plausible, rather than by a more reasoned analysis of available evidence.

Loss aversion

Loss aversion refers to the tendency to place greater weight on losses compared to equivalent gains. In other words, this means that when an individual receives a loss, this will cause their utility to decline more so than the same-sized gain. This means that they are far more likely to try to assign a higher priority on avoiding losses than making investment gains. As a result, some investors might want a higher payout to compensate for losses. If the high payout is not likely, they might try to avoid losses altogether even if the investment&#x27;s risk is acceptable from a rational standpoint.

Recency bias

Recency bias is the belief that of a particular outcome is more probably simply because it had just occurred. For example, if the previous one or two flips were heads, a person affected by recency bias would continue to predict that heads would be flipped.

Confirmation bias

Confirmation bias is the tendency to prefer information consistent with one&#x27;s beliefs and discount evidence inconsistent with them.

Familiarity bias

Familiarity bias simply describes the tendency of people to return to what they know and are comfortable with. Familiarity bias discourages affected people from exploring new options and may limit their ability to find an optimal solution.

Status quo bias

Status quo bias describes the tendency of people to keep things as they are. It is a particular aversion to change in favor of remaining comfortable with what is known.

Connected to this concept is the endowment effect, a theory that people value things more if they own them - they require more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.

== Behavioral finance ==
Behavioral finance is the study of the influence of psychology on the behavior of investors or financial analysts. It assumes that investors are not always rational, have limits to their self-control and are influenced by their own biases. For example, behavioral law and economics scholars studying the growth of financial firms&#x27; technological capabilities have attributed decision science to irrational consumer decisions. It also includes the subsequent effects on the markets. Behavioral Finance attempts to explain the reasoning patterns of investors and measures the influential power of these patterns on the investor&#x27;s decision making. The central issue in behavioral finance is explaining why market participants make irrational systematic errors contrary to assumption of rational market participants. Such errors affect prices and returns, creating market inefficiencies.

=== Traditional finance ===
The accepted theories of finance are referred to as traditional finance. The foundation of traditional finance is associated with the modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH). Modern portfolio theory is based on a stock or portfolio&#x27;s expected return, standard deviation, and its correlation with the other assets held within the portfolio. With these three concepts, an efficient portfolio can be created for any group of assets. An efficient portfolio is a group of assets that has the maximum expected return given the amount of risk. The efficient-market hypothesis states that all public information is already reflected in a security&#x27;s price. The proponents of the traditional theories believe that &quot;investors should just own the entire market rather than attempting to outperform the market&quot;. Behavioral finance has emerged as an alternative to these theories of traditional finance and the behavioral aspects of psychology and sociology are integral catalysts within this field of study.

=== Evolution ===

The foundations of behavioral finance can be traced back over 150 years. Several original books written in the 1800s and early 1900s marked the beginning of the behavioral finance school. Originally published in 1841, MacKay&#x27;s &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot; presents a chronological timeline of the various panics and schemes throughout history. This work shows how group behavior applies to the financial markets of today. Le Bon&#x27;s important work, &quot;The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind&quot;, discusses the role of &quot;crowds&quot; (also known as crowd psychology) and group behavior as they apply to the fields of behavioral finance, social psychology, sociology and history. Selden&#x27;s 1912 book &quot;Psychology of The Stock Market&quot; applies the field of psychology directly to the stock market and discusses the emotional and psychological forces at work on investors and traders in the financial markets. These three works along with several others form the foundation of applying psychology and sociology to the field of finance. The foundation of behavioral finance is an area based on an interdisciplinary approach including scholars from the social sciences and business schools. From the liberal arts perspective, this includes the fields of psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics and behavioral economics. On the business administration side, this covers areas such as management, marketing, finance, technology and accounting.

Critics contend that behavioral finance is more a collection of anomalies than a true branch of finance and that these anomalies are either quickly priced out of the market or explained by appealing to market microstructure arguments. However, individual cognitive biases are distinct from social biases; the former can be averaged out by the market, while the other can create positive feedback loops that drive the market further and further from a &quot;fair price&quot; equilibrium. It is observed that, the problem with the general area of behavioral finance is that it only serves as a complement to general economics. Similarly, for an anomaly to violate market efficiency, an investor must be able to trade against it and earn abnormal profits; this is not the case for many anomalies. A specific example of this criticism appears in some explanations of the equity premium puzzle. It is argued that the cause is entry barriers (both practical and psychological) and that the equity premium should reduce as electronic resources open up the stock market to more traders. In response, others contend that most personal investment funds are managed through superannuation funds, minimizing the effect of these putative entry barriers. In addition, professional investors and fund managers seem to hold more bonds than one would expect given return differentials.

=== Quantitative behavioral finance ===
Quantitative behavioral finance uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases.
Some financial models used in money management and asset valuation, as well as more theoretical models, likewise, incorporate behavioral finance parameters. Examples:
* Thaler&#x27;s model of price reactions to information, with three phases (underreaction, adjustment, and overreaction), creating a price trend. (One characteristic of overreaction is that average returns following announcements of good news is lower than following bad news. In other words, overreaction occurs if the market reacts too strongly or for too long to news, thus requiring an adjustment in the opposite direction. As a result, outperforming assets in one period is likely to underperform in the following period. This also applies to customers&#x27; irrational purchasing habits.)
* The stock image coefficient
* Artificial financial market
* Market microstructure

== Applied issues ==

=== Behavioral game theory ===

Behavioral game theory, invented by Colin Camerer, analyzes interactive strategic decisions and behavior using the methods of game theory, experimental economics, and experimental psychology. Experiments include testing deviations from typical simplifications of economic theory such as the independence axiom and neglect of altruism, fairness, and framing effects. On the positive side, the method has been applied to interactive learning and social preferences. As a research program, the subject is a development of the last three decades.

=== Artificial intelligence ===

Much of the decisions are more and more made either by human beings with the assistance of artificial intelligent machines or wholly made by these machines. Tshilidzi Marwala and Evan Hurwitz in their book, studied the utility of behavioral economics in such situations and concluded that these intelligent machines reduce the impact of bounded rational decision making. In particular, they observed that these intelligent machines reduce the degree of information asymmetry in the market, improve decision making and thus making markets more rational.

The use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic theories. Other theories where AI has had impact include in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning point, portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking.

=== Other areas of research ===
Other branches of behavioral economics enrich the model of the utility function without implying inconsistency in preferences. Ernst Fehr, Armin Falk, and Rabin studied fairness, inequity aversion and reciprocal altruism, weakening the neoclassical assumption of perfect selfishness. This work is particularly applicable to wage setting. The work on &quot;intrinsic motivation by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini and &quot;identity&quot; by George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton assumes that agents derive utility from adopting personal and social norms in addition to conditional expected utility. According to Aggarwal, in addition to behavioral deviations from rational equilibrium, markets are also likely to suffer from lagged responses, search costs, externalities of the commons, and other frictions making it difficult to disentangle behavioral effects in market behavior.

&quot;Conditional expected utility&quot; is a form of reasoning where the individual has an illusion of control, and calculates the probabilities of external events and hence their utility as a function of their own action, even when they have no causal ability to affect those external events.

Behavioral economics caught on among the general public with the success of books such as Dan Ariely&#x27;s &quot;Predictably Irrational.&quot; Practitioners of the discipline have studied quasi-public policy topics such as broadband mapping.

Applications for behavioral economics include the modeling of the consumer decision-making process for applications in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The Silicon Valley–based start-up Singularities is using the AGM postulates proposed by Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson—the formalization of the concepts of beliefs and change for rational entities—in a symbolic logic to create a &quot;machine learning and deduction engine that uses the latest data science and big data algorithms in order to generate the content and conditional rules (counterfactuals) that capture customer&#x27;s behaviors and beliefs.&quot;

The University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Center for Health Incentives &amp; Behavioral Economics (CHIBE) looks at how behavioral economics can improve health outcomes. CHIBE researchers have found evidence that many behavioral economics principles (incentives, patient and clinician nudges, gamification, loss aversion, and more) can be helpful to encourage vaccine uptake, smoking cessation, medication adherence, and physical activity, for example.

Applications of behavioral economics also exist in other disciplines, for example in the area of supply chain management.

Taken together, two landmark papers in economic theory which were published before the field of Behavioral Economics emerged, the first is the paper &quot;Uncertainty, Evolution, and Economic Theory&quot; by Armen Alchian from 1950 and the second is the paper &quot;Irrational Behavior and Economic Theory&quot; from 1962 by Gary Becker, both of which were published in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot;, provide a justification for standard neoclassical economic analysis. Alchian&#x27;s 1950 paper uses the logic of natural selection, the Evolutionary Landscape model, stochastic processes, probability theory, and several other lines of reasoning to justify many of the results derived from standard supply analysis assuming firms which maximizing their profits, are certain about the future, and have accurate foresight without having to assume any of those things. Becker&#x27;s 1962 paper shows that downward sloping market demand curves (the most important implication of the law of demand) do not actually require an assumption that the consumers in that market are rational, as is claimed by behavioral economists and they also follow from a wide variety of irrational behavior as well.

The lines of reasoning and argumentation used in these two papers is re-expressed and expanded upon in (at least) one other professional economic publication for each of them. As for Alchian&#x27;s evolutionary economics via natural selection by way of environmental adoption thesis, it is summarized, followed by an explicit exploration of its theoretical implications for Behavioral Economic theory, then illustrated via examples in several different industries including banking, hospitality, and transportation, in the 2014 paper &quot;Uncertainty, Evolution, and Behavioral Economic Theory,&quot; by Manne and Zywicki. And the argument made in Becker&#x27;s 1962 paper, that a &#x27;pure&#x27; increase in the (relative) price (or terms of trade) of good X must reduce the amount of X demanded in the market for good X, is explained in greater detail in chapters (or as he calls them, &quot;Lectures&quot; because this textbook is more or less a transcription of his lectures given in his Price Theory course taught to 1st year PhD students several years earlier) 4 (called The Opportunity Set) and 5 (called Substitution Effects) of Gary Becker&#x27;s graduate level textbook Economic Theory, originally published in 1971.

Besides the three critical aforementioned articles, critics of behavioral economics typically stress the rationality of economic agents. A fundamental critique is provided by Maialeh (2019) who argues that no behavioral research can establish an economic theory. Examples provided on this account include pillars of behavioral economics such as satisficing behavior or prospect theory, which are confronted from the neoclassical perspective of utility maximization and expected utility theory respectively. The author shows that behavioral findings are hardly generalizable and that they do not disprove typical mainstream axioms related to rational behavior.

Others, such as the essayist and former trader Nassim Taleb note that cognitive theories, such as prospect theory, are models of decision-making, not generalized economic behavior, and are only applicable to the sort of once-off decision problems presented to experiment participants or survey respondents. It is noteworthy that in the episode of EconTalk in which Taleb said this, he and the host, Russ Roberts discuss the significance of Gary Becker&#x27;s 1962 paper cited in the first paragraph in this section as an argument against any implications which can be drawn from one shot psychological experiments on market level outcomes outside of laboratory settings, i.e. in the real world. Others argue that decision-making models, such as the endowment effect theory, that have been widely accepted by behavioral economists may be erroneously established as a consequence of poor experimental design practices that do not adequately control subject misconceptions.

Despite a great deal of rhetoric, no unified behavioral theory has yet been espoused: behavioral economists have proposed no alternative unified theory of their own to replace neoclassical economics with.

David Gal has argued that many of these issues stem from behavioral economics being too concerned with understanding &quot;how&quot; behavior deviates from standard economic models rather than with understanding &quot;why&quot; people behave the way they do. Understanding why behavior occurs is necessary for the creation of generalizable knowledge, the goal of science. He has referred to behavioral economics as a &quot;triumph of marketing&quot; and particularly cited the example of loss aversion.

Traditional economists are skeptical of the experimental and survey-based techniques that behavioral economics uses extensively. Economists typically stress revealed preferences over stated preferences (from surveys) in the determination of economic value. Experiments and surveys are at risk of systemic biases, strategic behavior and lack of incentive compatibility. Some researchers point out that participants of experiments conducted by behavioral economists are not representative enough and drawing broad conclusions on the basis of such experiments is not possible. An acronym WEIRD has been coined in order to describe the studies participants—as those who come from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic societies.

=== Responses ===

Matthew Rabin dismisses these criticisms, countering that consistent results typically are obtained in multiple situations and geographies and can produce good theoretical insight. Behavioral economists, however, responded to these criticisms by focusing on field studies rather than lab experiments. Some economists see a fundamental schism between experimental economics and behavioral economics, but prominent behavioral and experimental economists tend to share techniques and approaches in answering common questions. For example, behavioral economists are investigating neuroeconomics, which is entirely experimental and has not been verified in the field.

The epistemological, ontological, and methodological components of behavioral economics are increasingly debated, in particular by historians of economics and economic methodologists.

According to some researchers, when studying the mechanisms that form the basis of decision-making, especially financial decision-making, it is necessary to recognize that most decisions are made under stress because, &quot;Stress is the nonspecific body response to any demands presented to it.&quot;

== Related fields ==
=== Experimental economics ===

Experimental economics is the application of experimental methods, including statistical, econometric, and computational, to study economic questions. Data collected in experiments are used to estimate effect size, test the validity of economic theories, and illuminate market mechanisms. Economic experiments usually use cash to motivate subjects, in order to mimic real-world incentives. Experiments are used to help understand how and why markets and other exchange systems function as they do. Experimental economics have also expanded to understand institutions and the law (experimental law and economics).

A fundamental aspect of the subject is design of experiments. Experiments may be conducted in the field or in laboratory settings, whether of individual or group behavior.

Variants of the subject outside such formal confines include natural and quasi-natural experiments.

=== Neuroeconomics ===

Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to explain human decision making, the ability to process multiple alternatives and to follow a course of action. It studies how economic behavior can shape our understanding of the brain, and how neuroscientific discoveries can constrain and guide models of economics. It combines research methods from neuroscience, experimental and behavioral economics, and cognitive and social psychology. As research into decision-making behavior becomes increasingly computational, it has also incorporated new approaches from theoretical biology, computer science, and mathematics.

Neuroeconomics studies decision making by using a combination of tools from these fields so as to avoid the shortcomings that arise from a single-perspective approach. In mainstream economics, expected utility (EU) and the concept of rational agents are still being used. Many economic behaviors are not fully explained by these models, such as heuristics and framing. Behavioral economics emerged to account for these anomalies by integrating social, cognitive, and emotional factors in understanding economic decisions. Neuroeconomics adds another layer by using neuroscientific methods in understanding the interplay between economic behavior and neural mechanisms. By using tools from various fields, some scholars claim that neuroeconomics offers a more integrative way of understanding decision making.

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
An evolutionary psychology perspective states that many of the perceived limitations in rational choice can be explained as being rational in the context of maximizing biological fitness in the ancestral environment, but not necessarily in the current one. Thus, when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may result in death, it may have been rational to place a greater value on preventing losses than on obtaining gains. It may also explain behavioral differences between groups, such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable reproductive success than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success from successful risk-seeking much more than females can.

<text>In economics and finance, risk aversion is the tendency of people to prefer outcomes with low uncertainty to those outcomes with high uncertainty, even if the average outcome of the latter is equal to or higher in monetary value than the more certain outcome. 

Risk aversion explains the inclination to agree to a situation with a lower average payoff that is more predictable rather than another situation with a less predictable payoff that is higher on average. For example, a risk-averse investor might choose to put their money into a bank account with a low but guaranteed interest rate, rather than into a stock that may have high expected returns, but also involves a chance of losing value.

==Example==

A person is given the choice between two scenarios: one with a guaranteed payoff, and one with a risky payoff with same average value. In the former scenario, the person receives $50. In the uncertain scenario, a coin is flipped to decide whether the person receives $100 or nothing. The expected payoff for both scenarios is $50, meaning that an individual who was insensitive to risk would not care whether they took the guaranteed payment or the gamble. However, individuals may have different risk attitudes.

A person is said to be:

* risk averse (or risk avoiding) - if they would accept a certain payment (certainty equivalent) of less than $50 (for example, $40), rather than taking the gamble and possibly receiving nothing.
* risk neutral – if they are indifferent between the bet and a certain $50 payment.
* risk loving (or risk seeking) – if they would accept the bet even when the guaranteed payment is more than $50 (for example, $60).

The average payoff of the gamble, known as its expected value, is $50. The smallest guaranteed dollar amount that an individual would be indifferent to compared to an uncertain gain of a specific average predicted value is called the certainty equivalent, which is also used as a measure of risk aversion. An individual that is risk averse has a certainty equivalent that is smaller than the prediction of uncertain gains. The risk premium is the difference between the expected value and the certainty equivalent. For risk-averse individuals, risk premium is positive, for risk-neutral persons it is zero, and for risk-loving individuals their risk premium is negative.

==Utility of money==
In expected utility theory, an agent has a utility function &quot;u&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) where &quot;c&quot; represents the value that he might receive in money or goods (in the above example &quot;c&quot; could be $0 or $40 or $100).

The utility function &quot;u&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) is defined only up to positive affine transformation – in other words, a constant could be added to the value of &quot;u&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) for all &quot;c&quot;, and/or &quot;u&quot;(&quot;c&quot;) could be multiplied by a positive constant factor, without affecting the conclusions.

An agent is risk-averse if and only if the utility function is concave. For instance &quot;u&quot;(0) could be 0, &quot;u&quot;(100) might be 10, &quot;u&quot;(40) might be 5, and for comparison &quot;u&quot;(50) might be 6.

The expected utility of the above bet (with a 50% chance of receiving 100 and a 50% chance of receiving 0) is

:formula_1

and if the person has the utility function with &quot;u&quot;(0)=0, &quot;u&quot;(40)=5, and &quot;u&quot;(100)=10 then the expected utility of the bet equals 5, which is the same as the known utility of the amount 40. Hence the certainty equivalent is 40.

The risk premium is ($50 minus $40)=$10, or in proportional terms

:formula_2

or 25% (where $50 is the expected value of the risky bet: (formula_3). This risk premium means that the person would be willing to sacrifice as much as $10 in expected value in order to achieve perfect certainty about how much money will be received. In other words, the person would be indifferent between the bet and a guarantee of $40, and would prefer anything over $40 to the bet.

In the case of a wealthier individual, the risk of losing $100 would be less significant, and for such small amounts his utility function would be likely to be almost linear. For instance, if u(0) = 0 and u(100) = 10, then u(40) might be 4.02 and u(50) might be 5.01.

The utility function for perceived gains has two key properties: an upward slope, and concavity. (i) The upward slope implies that the person feels that more is better: a larger amount received yields greater utility, and for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is first-order stochastically dominant over an alternative bet (that is, if the probability mass of the second bet is pushed to the right to form the first bet, then the first bet is preferred). (ii) The concavity of the utility function implies that the person is risk averse: a sure amount would always be preferred over a risky bet having the same expected value; moreover, for risky bets the person would prefer a bet which is a mean-preserving contraction of an alternative bet (that is, if some of the probability mass of the first bet is spread out without altering the mean to form the second bet, then the first bet is preferred).

== Measures of risk aversion under expected utility theory==
There are various measures of the risk aversion expressed by those given utility function. Several functional forms often used for utility functions are represented by these measures.

===Absolute risk aversion===
The higher the curvature of formula_4, the higher the risk aversion. However, since expected utility functions are not uniquely defined (are defined only up to affine transformations), a measure that stays constant with respect to these transformations is needed rather than just the second derivative of formula_4. One such measure is the Arrow–Pratt measure of absolute risk aversion (ARA), after the economists Kenneth Arrow and John W. Pratt, also known as the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, defined as

:formula_6

where formula_7 and formula_8 denote the first and second derivatives with respect to formula_9 of formula_4. For example, if formula_11 so formula_12 and formula_13 then formula_14 Note how formula_15 does not depend on formula_16 and formula_17 so affine transformations of formula_4 do not change it.

The following expressions relate to this term:
* Exponential utility of the form formula_19 is unique in exhibiting &quot;constant absolute risk aversion&quot; (CARA): formula_20 is constant with respect to &quot;c&quot;.
* Hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (HARA) is the most general class of utility functions that are usually used in practice (specifically, CRRA (constant relative risk aversion, see below), CARA (constant absolute risk aversion), and quadratic utility all exhibit HARA and are often used because of their mathematical tractability). A utility function exhibits HARA if its absolute risk aversion is a hyperbola, namely

:formula_21

The solution to this differential equation (omitting additive and multiplicative constant terms, which do not affect the behavior implied by the utility function) is:

:formula_22

where formula_23 and formula_24.
Note that when formula_25, this is CARA, as formula_26, and when formula_27, this is CRRA (see below), as formula_28.
See 
* &quot;Decreasing/increasing absolute risk aversion&quot; (DARA/IARA) is present if formula_15 is decreasing/increasing. Using the above definition of ARA, the following inequality holds for DARA:

:formula_30

and this can hold only if formula_31. Therefore, DARA implies that the utility function is positively skewed; that is, formula_31. Analogously, IARA can be derived with the opposite directions of inequalities, which permits but does not require a negatively skewed utility function (formula_33). An example of a DARA utility function is formula_34, with formula_35, while formula_36 formula_37, with formula_38 would represent a quadratic utility function exhibiting IARA.
*Experimental and empirical evidence is mostly consistent with decreasing absolute risk aversion.
* Contrary to what several empirical studies have assumed, wealth is not a good proxy for risk aversion when studying risk sharing in a principal-agent setting. Although formula_6 is monotonic in wealth under either DARA or IARA and constant in wealth under CARA, tests of contractual risk sharing relying on wealth as a proxy for absolute risk aversion are usually not identified.

=== Relative risk aversion ===
The Arrow–Pratt measure of relative risk aversion (RRA) or coefficient of relative risk aversion is defined as
: formula_40.

Unlike ARA whose units are in $−1, RRA is a dimensionless quantity, which allows it to be applied universally. Like for absolute risk aversion, the corresponding terms &quot;constant relative risk aversion&quot; (CRRA) and &quot;decreasing/increasing relative risk aversion&quot; (DRRA/IRRA) are used. This measure has the advantage that it is still a valid measure of risk aversion, even if the utility function changes from risk averse to risk loving as &quot;c&quot; varies, i.e. utility is not strictly convex/concave over all &quot;c&quot;. A constant RRA implies a decreasing ARA, but the reverse is not always true. As a specific example of constant relative risk aversion, the utility function formula_41 implies .

In intertemporal choice problems, the elasticity of intertemporal substitution often cannot be disentangled from the coefficient of relative risk aversion. The isoelastic utility function
: formula_42
exhibits constant relative risk aversion with formula_43 and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution formula_44. When formula_45 using l&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule shows that this simplifies to the case of &quot;log utility&quot;, , and the income effect and substitution effect on saving exactly offset.

A time-varying relative risk aversion can be considered.

===Implications of increasing/decreasing absolute and relative risk aversion===

The most straightforward implications of changing risk aversion occur in the context of forming a portfolio with one risky asset and one risk-free asset. If an investor experiences an increase in wealth, he/she will choose to decrease the total amount of wealth invested in the risky asset in proportion to absolute risk aversion and will decrease the relative fraction of the portfolio made up of the risky asset in proportion to relative risk aversion. Thus economists avoid using utility functions which exhibit increasing absolute risk aversion, because they have an unrealistic behavioral implication.

In one model in monetary economics, an increase in relative risk aversion increases the impact of households&#x27; money holdings on the overall economy. In other words, the more the relative risk aversion increases, the more money demand shocks will impact the economy.

===Portfolio theory===

In modern portfolio theory, risk aversion is measured as the additional expected reward an investor requires to accept additional risk. If an investor is risk-averse, they will invest in multiple uncertain assets, but only when the predicted return on a portfolio that is uncertain is greater than the predicted return on one that is not uncertain will the investor will prefer the former. Here, the risk-return spectrum is relevant, as it results largely from this type of risk aversion. Here risk is measured as the standard deviation of the return on investment, i.e. the square root of its variance. In advanced portfolio theory, different kinds of risk are taken into consideration. They are measured as the n-th root of the n-th central moment. The symbol used for risk aversion is A or An.

:formula_47

=== Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem ===
The von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem is another model used to denote how risk aversion influences an actor’s utility function. An extension of the expected utility function, the von Neumann-Morgenstern model includes risk aversion axiomatically rather than as an additional variable.

John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern first developed the model in their book &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behaviour.&quot; Essentially, von Neumann and Morgenstern hypothesised that individuals seek to maximise their expected utility rather than the expected monetary value of assets. In defining expected utility in this sense, the pair developed a function based on preference relations. As such, if an individual’s preferences satisfy four key axioms, then a utility function based on how they weigh different outcomes can be deduced.

In applying this model to risk aversion, the function can be used to show how an individual’s preferences of wins and losses will influence their expected utility function. For example, if a risk-averse individual with $20,000 in savings is given the option to gamble it for $100,000 with a 30% chance of winning, they may still not take the gamble in fear of losing their savings. This does not make sense using the traditional expected utility model however;

formula_48

formula_49

formula_50

The von Neumann-Morgenstern model can explain this scenario. Based on preference relations, a specific utility formula_51 can be assigned to both outcomes. Now the function becomes;

formula_52

For a risk averse person, formula_51 would equal a value that means that the individual would rather keep their $20,000 in savings than gamble it all to potentially increase their wealth to $100,000. Hence a risk averse individuals’ function would show that;

formula_54

==Limitations of expected utility treatment of risk aversion==
Using expected utility theory&#x27;s approach to risk aversion to analyze &quot;small stakes decisions&quot; has come under criticism. Matthew Rabin has showed that a risk-averse, expected-utility-maximizing individual who,

&quot;from any initial wealth level [...] turns down gambles where she loses $100 or gains $110, each with 50% probability [...] will turn down 50–50 bets of losing $1,000 or gaining any sum of money.&quot;

Rabin criticizes this implication of expected utility theory on grounds of implausibility—individuals who are risk averse for small gambles due to diminishing marginal utility would exhibit extreme forms of risk aversion in risky decisions under larger stakes. One solution to the problem observed by Rabin is that proposed by prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory, where outcomes are considered relative to a reference point (usually the status quo), rather than considering only the final wealth.

Another limitation is the reflection effect, which demonstrates the reversing of risk aversion. This effect was first presented by Kahneman and Tversky as a part of the prospect theory, in the behavioral economics domain.
The reflection effect is an identified pattern of opposite preferences between negative as opposed to positive prospects: people tend to avoid risk when the gamble is between gains, and to seek risks when the gamble is between losses. For example, most people prefer a certain gain of 3,000 to an 80% chance of a gain of 4,000. When posed the same problem, but for losses, most people prefer an 80% chance of a loss of 4,000 to a certain loss of 3,000.

The reflection effect (as well as the certainty effect) is inconsistent with the expected utility hypothesis. It is assumed that the psychological principle which stands behind this kind of behavior is the overweighting of certainty. Options which are perceived as certain are over-weighted relative to uncertain options. This pattern is an indication of risk-seeking behavior in negative prospects and eliminates other explanations for the certainty effect such as aversion for uncertainty or variability.

The initial findings regarding the reflection effect faced criticism regarding its validity, as it was claimed that there are insufficient evidence to support the effect on the individual level. Subsequently, an extensive investigation revealed its possible limitations, suggesting that the effect is most prevalent when either small or large amounts and extreme probabilities are involved.

== Bargaining and risk aversion ==
Numerous studies have shown that in riskless bargaining scenarios, being risk-averse is disadvantageous. Moreover, opponents will always prefer to play against the most risk-averse person. Based on both the von Neumann-Morgenstern and Nash Game Theory model, a risk-averse person will happily receive a smaller commodity share of the bargain. This is because their utility function concaves hence their utility increases at a decreasing rate while their non-risk averse opponents may increase at a constant or increasing rate. Intuitively, a risk-averse person will hence settle for a smaller share of the bargain as opposed to a risk-neutral or risk-seeking individual.

==In the brain==
Attitudes towards risk have attracted the interest of the field of neuroeconomics and behavioral economics. A 2009 study by Christopoulos et al. suggested that the activity of a specific brain area (right inferior frontal gyrus) correlates with risk aversion, with more risk averse participants (i.e. those having higher risk premia) also having higher responses to safer options. This result coincides with other studies, that show that neuromodulation of the same area results in participants making more or less risk averse choices, depending on whether the modulation increases or decreases the activity of the target area.

==Public understanding and risk in social activities==
In the real world, many government agencies, e.g. Health and Safety Executive, are fundamentally risk-averse in their mandate. This often means that they demand (with the power of legal enforcement) that risks be minimized, even at the cost of losing the utility of the risky activity.
It is important to consider the opportunity cost when mitigating a risk; the cost of not taking the risky action. Writing laws focused on the risk without the balance of the utility may misrepresent society&#x27;s goals. The public understanding of risk, which influences political decisions, is an area which has recently been recognised as deserving focus. In 2007 Cambridge University initiated the Winton Professorship of the Public Understanding of Risk, a role described as outreach rather than traditional academic research by the holder, David Spiegelhalter.

===Children===
Children&#x27;s services such as schools and playgrounds have become the focus of much risk-averse planning, meaning that children are often prevented from benefiting from activities that they would otherwise have had. Many playgrounds have been fitted with impact-absorbing matting surfaces. However, these are only designed to save children from death in the case of direct falls on their heads and do not achieve their main goals. They are expensive, meaning that less resources are available to benefit users in other ways (such as building a playground closer to the child&#x27;s home, reducing the risk of a road traffic accident on the way to it), and—some argue—children may attempt more dangerous acts, with confidence in the artificial surface. Shiela Sage, an early years school advisor, observes &quot;Children who are only ever kept in very safe places, are not the ones who are able to solve problems for themselves. Children need to have a certain amount of risk taking ... so they&#x27;ll know how to get out of situations.&quot;

===Game shows and investments===
One experimental study with student-subject playing the game of the TV show Deal or No Deal finds that people are more risk averse in the limelight than in the anonymity of a typical behavioral laboratory. In the laboratory treatments, subjects made decisions in a standard, computerized laboratory setting as typically employed in behavioral experiments. In the limelight treatments, subjects made their choices in a simulated game show environment, which included a live audience, a game show host, and video cameras. In line with this, studies on investor behavior find that investors trade more and more speculatively after switching from phone-based to online trading and that investors tend to keep their core investments with traditional brokers and use a small fraction of their wealth to speculate online.

== The behavioural approach to employment status ==
The basis of the theory, on the connection between employment status and risk aversion, is the varying income level of individuals. On average higher income earners are less risk averse than lower income earners. In terms of employment the greater the wealth of an individual the less risk averse they can afford to be, and they are more inclined to make the move from a secure job to an entrepreneurial venture. The literature assumes a small increase in income or wealth initiates the transition from employment to entrepreneurship-based decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA), constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), and increasing absolute risk aversion (IARA) preferences as properties in their utility function. The apportioning risk perspective can also be used to as a factor in the transition of employment status, only if the strength of downside risk aversion exceeds the strength of risk aversion. If using the behavioural approach to model an individual’s decision on their employment status there must be more variables than risk aversion and any absolute risk aversion preferences.

Incentive effects are a factor in the behavioural approach an individual takes in deciding to move from a secure job to entrepreneurship. Non-financial incentives provided by an employer can change the decision to transition into entrepreneurship as the intangible benefits helps to strengthen how risk averse an individual is relative to the strength of downside risk aversion. Utility functions do not equate for such effects and can often screw the estimated behavioural path that an individual takes towards their employment status.

The design of experiments, to determine at what increase of wealth or income would an individual change their employment status from a position of security to more risky ventures, must include flexible utility specifications with salient incentives integrated with risk preferences. The application of relevant experiments can avoid the generalisation of varying individual preferences through the use of this model and its specified utility functions.

<text>&quot;If You&#x27;re Happy and You Know It&quot; is a popular traditional repetitive children&#x27;s song, folksong, and drinking song. The song has been noted for its similarities to &quot;Molodejnaya&quot;, a song appearing in the 1938 Soviet musical film &quot;Volga-Volga&quot;.

==History==
The origin of the melody is not known, but numerous sources trace it back to Spain, Latin America, Latvia or the United States of America.

The song was published in various places through the decades following the late 1960s, including a volume of &quot;constructive recreational activities&quot; for children (1957), a book of drama projects for disabled children (1967), and a nursing home manual (1966).

In 1971, Jonico Music filed for copyright on the song, crediting it to Joe Raposo.

During the early part of the 2000s, the music Recording Industry Association of America sued individuals for downloading music using file-sharing services. Widespread media attention was paid to one 12-year-old, whose downloads included &quot;If You&#x27;re Happy and You Know It&quot; from Kazaa.

In 2007, the song was included as part of the Nihon no Uta Hyakusen, a list of the 100 most well-known folk songs in Japan. It is one of nine songs from foreign countries included on the list. It was selected by the Agency of Cultural Affairs and the National Congress of Parents and Teachers Associations of Japan.

In 2020, Granger Smith recorded a version that relied on alcohol drinking called &quot;Country and Ya Know It&quot;.

==Lyric variations==
Like many children&#x27;s songs, there are many versions of the lyrics. A popular version goes as follows:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
If you&#x27;re happy and you know it, clap your hands!
If you&#x27;re happy and you know it, clap your hands!
If you&#x27;re happy and you know it, and you really want to show it;
If you&#x27;re happy and you know it, clap your hands!&lt;/poem&gt;

This verse is usually followed by more which follow the same pattern but say: &quot;If you&#x27;re happy and you know it, stomp/stamp your feet!&quot;, &quot;If you&#x27;re happy and you know it, shout/say &#x27;hooray&#x27;!&quot; or &quot;shout/say &#x27;amen&#x27;!&quot;, &quot;If you&#x27;re happy and you know it, do all three!&quot;, &quot;If you&#x27;re happy and you know it, do all four!&quot;. Other versions of the song tend to say, &quot;then your face will surely show it&quot; in place of &quot;and you really want to show it&quot;; the form &quot;then you really ought to show it&quot; has also been used. Many variations on the substance of the first three verses exist, including:
:&quot;... stomp/stamp your feet!&quot;
:&quot;... wave your arms!&quot;
:&quot;... say, &quot;hooray!&quot;, &quot;amen!&quot;, &quot;we are!&quot;&quot;
:&quot;... do all three, four, five, etc.!&quot;

===Oh Be Careful Little Eyes===
Oh, Be Careful Little Eyes is a very popular Christian children&#x27;s song. It is sung to the tune of If You&#x27;re Happy and You Know It, and it teaches children to be careful about what they see, hear, say, and do. This song is about living a life that pleases God. The song is rooted in the biblical principle of living a life pleasing to God, particularly in line with verses such as Proverbs 4:23, which encourages guarding the heart, and Psalm 101:3, which advises not to set wicked things before people&#x27;s eyes. 

====Lyrics====
Each verse of the song addresses a different part of the body with a sense, to encourage children to be careful with what they see with their eyes, hear with their ears, trust with their mind, etc.

====Meaning====
&quot;Oh, Be Careful Little Eyes&quot; is a reminder to children that God is omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent, so to be mindful. It is satisfying for children and adults alike.

In the Japanese version as popularized by Kyu Sakamoto and included as the 11th track of &quot;Kyu Sakamoto Memorial Best&quot;, the third line has a different melody to fit the Japanese lyrics.

<doc id="177707" wikidata="Q278495" url="?curid=177707" title="Marianne Moore">
<text>Marianne Craig Moore (November 15, 1887 – February 5, 1972) was an American modernist poet, critic, translator, and editor. Her poetry is noted for its formal innovation, precise diction, irony, and wit. In 1968, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Nobel Committee member Erik Lindegren.

== Early life ==
Moore was born in Kirkwood, Missouri, in the manse of the Presbyterian church where her maternal grandfather, John Riddle Warner, served as pastor. Her father, John Milton Moore, a mechanical engineer and inventor, suffered a psychotic episode, as a consequence of which her parents separated before she was born; Moore never met him. She and her elder brother, John Warner Moore, were reared by their mother, Mary Warner Moore. The family wrote voluminous letters to one another throughout their lives, often addressing each other by playful nicknames based on characters from &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; and using a private language.

Like her mother and her brother, Moore remained a devoted Presbyterian, strongly influenced by her grandfather, approaching her Christian faith as a lesson in strength vindicated through trials and temptations; her poems often deal with the themes of strength and adversity. She thought &quot;it was not possible to live without religious faith&quot;. Moore lived in the St. Louis area until she was six. After her grandfather died in 1894, the three stayed with relatives near Pittsburgh for two years, then moved to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where her mother found employment teaching English in a private girls school.

Moore entered Bryn Mawr College in 1905. She was graduated four years later with an A.B., having majored in history, economics, and political science. The poet H.D. was among her classmates during their freshman year. At Bryn Mawr, Moore started writing short stories and poems for &quot;Tipyn O&#x27;Bob&quot;, the campus literary magazine, and decided to become a writer. After graduation, she worked briefly at Melvil Dewey&#x27;s Lake Placid Club, then taught business subjects at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School from 1911 to 1914.

== Poetic career ==
Moore&#x27;s first professionally published poems appeared in &quot;The Egoist&quot; and &quot;Poetry&quot; in the spring of 1915. Harriet Monroe, the editor of the latter, would describe them in her biography as possessing &quot;an elliptically musical profundity&quot;.

In 1916, Moore moved with her mother to Chatham, New Jersey, a community with commuting transportation to Manhattan. Two years later, the two moved to New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, where Moore socialized with many &quot;avant-garde&quot; artists, especially those associated with &quot;Others&quot; magazine. The innovative poems she was writing at that time received high praise from Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, H.D., T. S. Eliot, and later, Wallace Stevens.

Moore&#x27;s first book, &quot;Poems&quot;, was published without her permission in 1921 by the Imagist poet H.D. and H.D.&#x27;s partner, the British novelist Bryher. Moore&#x27;s later poetry shows some influence from the Imagists&#x27; principles.

Her second book, &quot;Observations&quot;, won the Dial Award in 1924. She worked part-time as a librarian during these years; then from 1925 to 1929, she edited &quot;The Dial&quot; magazine, a literary and cultural journal. This position in the literary and arts community extended her influence as an arbiter of modernist taste; much later, she encouraged promising young poets, including Elizabeth Bishop, Allen Ginsberg, John Ashbery, and James Merrill. When &quot;The Dial&quot; ceased publication in 1929, she moved to 260 Cumberland Street in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, where she remained for thirty-six years. She continued to write while caring for her ailing mother, who died in 1947. For nine years before and after her mother&#x27;s death, Moore translated the &quot;Fables of La Fontaine&quot;.
In 1933, Moore was awarded the Helen Haire Levinson Prize by &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine. In 1951, her &quot;Collected Poems&quot; won the National Book Award, the Pulitzer Prize, and the Bollingen Prize. In the book&#x27;s introduction, T. S. Eliot wrote, &quot;My conviction has remained unchanged for the last 14 years that Miss Moore&#x27;s poems form part of the small body of durable poetry written in our time.&quot; After years of seclusion, she emerged as a celebrity, speaking at college campuses across the country and appearing in photographic essays in &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Look&quot; magazines. Moore became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1955. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1962 and in 1967 she was awarded The Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony for outstanding contributions to American culture. Moore continued to publish poems in various magazines, including, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, as well as publishing various books and collections of her poetry and criticism.

She moved to 35 West Ninth Street in Manhattan in 1965. After she moved back to Greenwich Village, she was widely recognized around town for her tricorn hat and black cape. She liked athletics and was a great admirer of Muhammad Ali, for whose spoken-word album &quot;I Am the Greatest!&quot; she wrote the liner notes. She became known as a baseball fan, first of the Brooklyn Dodgers and then of the New York Yankees. She threw out the ball to open the season at Yankee Stadium in 1968.

At the age of 81, Moore received the 1968 National Medal for Literature. The committee overseeing the award stated: &quot;One of the few true inventors of poetry in our time, Marianne Moore, the first lady of poetry, gives us intimations of exquisite perfection.&quot;

Moore suffered a series of strokes in her last years. She died in 1972, and her ashes were interred with those of her mother at the family&#x27;s burial plot at the Evergreen Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. By the time of her death, she had received many honorary degrees and virtually every honor available to an American poet. The &quot;New York Times&quot; printed a full-page obituary. In 1996, she was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

Moore corresponded with Ezra Pound from 1918 onward and visited him regularly during his incarceration at St. Elizabeth&#x27;s. She opposed Benito Mussolini and Fascism from the start and objected to Pound&#x27;s antisemitism. Moore was a Republican and supported Herbert Hoover in 1928 and 1932. She was a lifelong ally and friend of the American poet Wallace Stevens, as demonstrated in her review of Stevens&#x27;s first collection, &quot;Harmonium&quot;, and, in particular, by her comment about the influence of Henri Rousseau on the poem &quot;Floral Decorations for Bananas&quot;. She also corresponded, from 1943 to 1961, with the reclusive collage artist Joseph Cornell, whose methods of collecting and appropriation were much like her own.

In 1955, Moore was invited informally by David Wallace, manager of marketing research for Ford&#x27;s &quot;E-car&quot; project, and his co-worker Bob Young, to suggest a name for the car. Wallace&#x27;s rationale was &quot;Who better to understand the nature of words than a poet?&quot; In October 1955, Moore was approached to submit &quot;inspirational names&quot; for the E-car, and on November 7, she offered her list of names, which included such notables as &quot;Resilient Bullet&quot;, &quot;Ford Silver Sword&quot;, &quot;Mongoose Civique&quot;, &quot;Varsity Stroke&quot;, &quot;Pastelogram&quot;, and &quot;Andante con Moto&quot;. On December 8, she submitted her last and most famous name, &quot;Utopian Turtletop&quot;. The E-car was christened by Ford as the Edsel.

Moore never married. Her living room has been preserved in its original layout in the collections of the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia. Her entire library, knick-knacks (including a baseball signed by Mickey Mantle), all of her correspondence, photographs, and poetry drafts are available for public viewing.

Like Robert Lowell, Moore revised many of her early poems in later life. Most of these revised works appeared in the &quot;Complete Poems&quot; of 1967. Facsimile editions of the theretofore out-of-print 1924 &quot;Observations&quot; became available in 2002. Since that time, there has been no critical consensus about which versions are authoritative. As Moore wrote, as a one-line epigraph to &quot;Complete Poems&quot;, which offered her well-known work &quot;Poetry&quot; cut down from twenty-nine lines to three: &quot;Omissions are not accidents.&quot; In a foreword to &quot;A Marianne Moore Reader&quot; in 1961, Moore said her favorite poem was the Book of Job.
Moore&#x27;s novel and an unfinished memoir have not been published. In her will, she established a fund for the support of the Camperdown Elm in Brooklyn&#x27;s Prospect Park, a rare and ancient tree that she had celebrated in a poem.

In 2012, she was inducted into the New York State Writers Hall of Fame.

== Poetic style ==
Moore&#x27;s most famous poem is perhaps , in which she praises poets who create &quot;imaginary gardens with real toads in them&quot;. It also asserts that meter and other traditional poetic devices are not as important as delight in language and precise, heartfelt expression. Moore&#x27;s meter was radically separate from the English tradition; writing her syllabic poems after the advent of free verse, she was encouraged thereby to try previously unused meters.

She credited the poetry of Edith Sitwell as &quot;intensifying her interest in rhythm and encouraging her rhythmic eccentricities&quot;. In response to a biographical sketch in 1935, Moore indicated &quot;a liking for unaccented rhyme, the movement of the poem musically is more important than the conventional look of lines upon the page, and the stanza as the unit of composition rather than the line&quot;. Later in her &quot;Selected Poems&quot; of 1969, she also commented in regard to her poetic form, that &quot;in anything I have written, there have been lines in which the chief interest is borrowed, and I have not yet been able to outgrow this hybrid method of composition&quot;.

Moore often composed her poetry in syllabics; she used stanzas with a predetermined number of syllables as her &quot;unit of sense&quot;, with indentation underlining the parallels, the shape of the stanza indicating the syllabic disposition, and her reading voice conveying the syntactical line. These syllabic lines from &quot;Poetry&quot; illustrate her position: poetry is a matter of skill and honesty in any form whatsoever, while anything written poorly, although in perfect form, cannot be poetry:

==Translations==
Moore translated the seventeenth-century Fables of La Fontaine into English. Hugh Kenner asserted that she had accomplished the task &quot;with incomparable deftness.&quot;

==Musical adaptations==

Though not as widely set to music as the work of other poets, there have been musical adaptations by several American composers, including pieces by Samuel Adler (composer), William Bolcom, Juliana Hall, Lewis Spratlan, and Virgil Thomson.

== Involvement in the American suffrage movement ==

Moore was involved in the American suffrage movement starting in her university years at Bryn Mawr, from 1905 to 1909. During this time in the American suffrage movement, Anna Howard Shaw had just taken over as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association; Harriot Stanton Blatch formed the Equality League of Self Supporting Women, which started the practice of suffrage parades; and soon (in 1910) women in the state of Washington were granted the right to vote.

Moore&#x27;s combined major in history, politics, and economics and the suffrage involvement of professors and other students at Bryn Mawr exposed her to the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, especially because it was a &quot;unique period in the history of women&#x27;s college, as the values of progressivism, women&#x27;s education, and the ideology of separate spheres came together in a kind of perfect storm that created a climate for cultural change&quot;. Moore was involved in a &quot;suffrage society&quot;, a chapter of the National College Equal Suffrage League, and she was present at most of their events. Notably, Moore wrote in her personal letters to her family that she attended lectures at Bryn Mawr by the well-known feminist Jane Addams and the British suffragette Anne Cobden-Sanderson. Of the American suffragist Anna Howard Shaw, she wrote: &quot;Miss Shaw spoke last night on the Modern Democratic ideal. I couldn&#x27;t say how she delighted me. No decent, half-kind, creature could possibly think of fighting suffrage if he or it had heard her arguments.&quot;

Moore visited New York City in 1909 with another Bryn Mawr student, where she heard a lecture by the Colorado suffragist Judge Ben Lindsey, went to a suffrage mass meeting, and saw J. M. Barrie&#x27;s classic suffragist-themed play &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot;. There is speculation that Moore also participated in the women&#x27;s suffrage parade of 1913 in Washington, D.C., one day before Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s presidential inauguration. Although in her personal letters she told her brother, Warner, that she did not participate in the parade after he cautioned her about the possible dangers she would face from the opponents of the parade, &quot;[h]er scrapbook includes programs and newspaper clippings about the march&quot;, and she later told the poet Elizabeth Bishop that she &quot;paraded with the suffragettes, led by Inez Milholland on her white horse&quot;.

Moore was never as public about her involvement in the suffrage movement after that parade in 1913, because afterward she began participating anonymously, mostly through writing, using a pseudonym. During her stay in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, she admitted years later, she &quot;wrote suffrage pieces for the Carlisle newspaper&quot;, which at the time appeared to be authored anonymously. Dr. Mary Chapman (University of British Columbia) argues that Moore was the writer of suffragist writings of the time in Carlisle news publications and that could be analyzed by examining her specific writing style alongside suffragist prose and poetry that were published in the &quot;Carlisle Evening Herald&quot; in 1915: &quot;Many of the prosuffrage articles that appeared in the &quot;Herald&quot; exhibit Moore&#x27;s characteristic reliance on quotation.&quot; Additionally, a letter appealing for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the &quot;Carlisle Evening Sentinel&quot; is signed &quot;Miss M.M.&quot;, which scholars believe could stand for Marianne Moore because &quot;the absence of any other documented unmarried female suffragists in the Carlisle area with the initials M.M. make it likely that the &quot;Sentinel&quot; reader who coyly constructs a letter to the editor almost entirely from quotation is Marianne Moore&quot;. Moore&#x27;s poem &quot;Silence&quot; (1924) also resembles the writing style that was seen in the &quot;Sentinel&quot; letter. Moore established herself on the surface as a modernist poet, and the common practice within the modernist circle of poets was to not engage with the politics of the time; but her writings displayed a &quot;sophisticated political subtext&quot;.

<doc id="177710" wikidata="Q3259845" url="?curid=177710" title="Lost in Space (Aimee Mann album)">
<text>Lost in Space is the fourth album by singer-songwriter Aimee Mann, released in 2002 on her own label, SuperEgo Records. A special edition released in 2003 featured a second disc containing six live recordings, two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs.

Mann performed the songs &quot;This Is How It Goes&quot; and &quot;Pavlov&#x27;s Bell&quot; during a guest appearance on the television show &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, in the season seven episode &quot;Sleeper&quot;. &quot;Today&#x27;s the Day&quot; is featured in the 2002 film &quot;Enough&quot;. The cover and accompanying mini-comic were drawn by Canadian cartoonist Seth.

==Reception==

&quot;Lost in Space&quot; holds a score of 74 out of 100 from Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. E! Online gave the album a B+ and stated, &quot;Mann&#x27;s cranky muse is consistently compelling, showcasing both her wry lyrics and terrific melodies.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; gave the album four stars out of five and called it &quot;textured and complex&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; also gave it four stars out of five and said the album &quot;pushes [Mann] in a new direction.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; likewise gave it four stars and said that Mann has &quot;returned to writing songs which are wry, funny, adult and perceptive, all wrapped up in handsome melodies.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; gave it a positive review and called it &quot;sonically rich&quot; and &quot;home to some of Mann&#x27;s most intimate storytelling.&quot; Neumu.net gave it seven stars out of ten and called it &quot;a rare record that simply responds to the quiet masses who maybe feel just a bit too much too often, and offers them a soothing, downbeat source of comfort without preaching or apology.&quot; &quot;Mojo&quot; gave it a positive review and stated: &quot;Michael Lockwood&#x27;s production occasionally affects a sound akin to a Vonda Sheppard reared on black dreams and Russian literature.&quot;

Other reviews are very average or mixed: &quot;Trouser Press&quot; gave it an average review and said of Mann, &quot;The songs are not as strong overall as on her previous albums, and the tempo neither flags nor picks up over the course of the album.&quot; In his &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave it a C+ and said of Mann, &quot;For her fans, the news is that she&#x27;s invested her profits in studio musicians. Takes talent to make that more boring than solo acoustic, no?&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave it two stars out of five and said, &quot;The tempos and melodies drag throughout; it&#x27;s as though we&#x27;ve heard Mann sing these songs before, only here her understated passion comes off more like overstated indifference.&quot;

<doc id="177711" wikidata="Q193364" url="?curid=177711" title="Vicar">
<text>A vicar (; Latin: &quot;vicarius&quot;) is a representative, deputy or substitute; anyone acting &quot;in the person of&quot; or for a superior (compare &quot;vicarious&quot; in the sense of &quot;at second hand&quot;). Linguistically, &quot;vicar&quot; is cognate with the English prefix &quot;vice&quot;, similarly meaning &quot;deputy&quot;. It also refers to a senior priest in the Church of England. The title appears in a number of Christian ecclesiastical contexts, but also as an administrative title, or title modifier, in the Roman Empire. In addition, in the Holy Roman Empire, a local representative of the emperor, such as an archduke, could be styled &quot;vicar&quot;.

==Catholic Church==
The Pope bears the title vicar of Christ (Latin: &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot;).

In Catholic canon law, &quot;a vicar is the representative of any ecclesiastic&quot; entity. The Romans had used the term to describe officials subordinate to the praetorian prefects. In the early Christian churches, bishops likewise had their vicars, such as the archdeacons and archpriests, and also the rural priest, the curate who had the &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;care&quot; of all the souls outside the episcopal cities. The position of the Roman Catholic vicar as it evolved is sketched in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1908).

Vicars have various titles based on what role they are performing. An apostolic vicar is a bishop or priest who heads a missionary particular Church that is not yet ready to be a full diocese – he stands as the local representative of the Pope, in the Pope&#x27;s role as bishop of all unorganized territories. A vicar capitular, who exercises authority in the place of the diocesan chapter, is a temporary ordinary of a diocese during a &quot;sede vacante&quot; period.

Vicars exercise authority as the agents of the bishop of the diocese. Most vicars, however, have ordinary power, which means that their agency is not by virtue of a delegation but is established by law. Vicars general, episcopal vicars, and judicial vicars exercise vicarious ordinary power; they each exercise a portion of the power of the diocesan bishop (judicial for the judicial vicar, executive for the others) by virtue of their office and not by virtue of a mandate.

A &quot;vicar forane&quot;, also known as an archpriest or dean, is a priest entrusted by the bishop with a certain degree of leadership in a territorial division of a diocese or a pastoral region known as a vicarate forane or a deanery.

A parochial vicar is a priest assigned to a parish in addition to, and in collaboration with, the parish priest or rector. He exercises his ministry as an agent of the parish&#x27;s pastor, who is termed &quot;parochus&quot; in Latin.
Some papal legates are given the title &quot;Vicar of the Apostolic See&quot;.

A vicar can be the priest of a &quot;chapel of ease&quot;, a building within the parish which is not the parish church. Non-resident canons led also to the institution of &quot;vicars choral&quot;, each canon having his own vicar, who sat in his stall in his absence (see Cathedral).

In Opus Dei, a regional vicar is a priest designated to fulfil responsibilities for an entire country or region, such as France or the United States.

Within religious communities, the vicar is the secondary superior of the group, subject only to the Superior General, whether of an individual community or monastery, or of a wider jurisdiction, called, e.g., a Vicar Provincial. In these organizations, the office is filled by any member of the community, whether clergy or lay.

==Eastern Orthodox Church==
In the Russian Orthodox Church and some other non-Hellenic Eastern Orthodox churches that historically follow Russian tradition, vicar (Russian: &quot;vikariy&quot; / викарий) is a term for what is known as suffragan bishop in the Anglican Communion or as auxiliary bishop in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church. A vicar bishop usually bears in his title the names of both his titular see (usually, a smaller town within the diocese he ministers in) and the see he is subordinate to. For example, Ignaty Punin, the vicar bishop under the Diocese of Smolensk, is titled &quot;The Right Reverend Ignaty, the bishop of Vyazma, the vicar of the Diocese of Smolensk&quot;, Vyasma being a smaller town inside the territory of the Diocese of Smolensk. Normally, only large dioceses have vicar bishops, sometimes more than one. Usually, Russian Orthodox vicar bishops have no independent jurisdiction (even in their titular towns) and are subordinate to their diocesan bishops; though some of them &quot;de facto&quot; may have jurisdiction over some territories, especially when there is a need to avoid an overlapping jurisdiction.

In some other Eastern Orthodox churches the term &quot;chorbishop&quot; is used instead of &quot;vicar bishop&quot;.

==Anglicanism==

In Anglicanism, a &quot;vicar&quot; is a type of parish priest. Historically, parish priests in the Church of England were divided into vicars, &quot;rectors&quot;, and &quot;perpetual curates&quot;. The parish clergy and church were supported by tithes—like a local tax (traditionally, as the etymology of &quot;tithe&quot; suggests, of ten percent) levied on the personal as well as agricultural output of the parish. Roughly speaking, the distinction was that a rector directly received both the greater and lesser tithes of his parish while a vicar received only the lesser tithes (the greater tithes going to the lay holder, or &quot;impropriator&quot;, of the living); a perpetual curate with a small cure and often aged or infirm received neither greater nor lesser tithes, and received only a small salary (paid sometimes by the diocese). (See also in Church of England.) Today, the roles of a rector and a vicar are essentially the same. Which of the two titles is held by the parish priest is historical. Some parishes have a rector, others a vicar.

In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the positions of &quot;vicar&quot; and &quot;curate&quot; are not recognized in the canons of the entire church. However, some diocesan canons do define &quot;vicar&quot; as the priest in charge of a mission; and &quot;curate&quot; is often used for assistants, being entirely analogous to the English situation.

===Vicarage===

A vicarage, or vicarage house, is a residence provided by the church for the priest. They were usually located near the church and were sometimes quite elaborate and other times inadequate. Dating from medieval times, they were often rebuilt and modernized. In the second half of the 20th century, most large vicarages were replaced with more modern and simpler houses.

==Lutheran usage==
In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, the Lutheran Church–Canada, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, a vicar is a candidate for ordained pastoral ministry, serving in a vicariate or internship, usually in the third year of seminary training, though it can be delayed to the fourth year (this is often referred to as &quot;a vicarage&quot;, a homonym of the residence of the Vicar). Typically at the end of the year of vicarage, the candidate returns to seminary and completes a final year of studies. After being issued a call or assignment, the candidate is ordained as a pastor in the ministry of Word and Sacrament. The role of a vicar in the Lutheran tradition is most comparable to that of a transitional deacon in the Anglican and Roman churches, except that Lutheran vicars are not ordained. In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in South Africa, a vicar is a person who has completed seminary training and is awaiting ordination while serving at a parish where the Diocesan Council places him or her.

The title &quot;Vikar&quot;, used in the Lutheran churches in Germany, is comparable while the Lutheran Church of Sweden calls it &quot;kyrkoherde&quot; (&quot;church shepherd&quot;), although that title is more comparable to a rector.

==In fiction==
Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s novel &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; (1766) and Honoré de Balzac&#x27;s &quot;The Curate of Tours&quot; (&quot;Le Curé de Tours&quot;; 1832) evoke the impoverished world of the 18th- and 19th-century vicar. Anthony Trollope&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot; are peopled with churchmen of varying situations, from wealthy to impoverished; the income differences prompted a digression in &quot;Framley Parsonage&quot; (chapter 14) on the incomprehensible logic that made one vicar rich and another poor. The 18th-century satirical ballad &quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot; reveals the changes of conscience a vicar (whether of the Bray in Berkshire or of that in County Wicklow) might undergo in order to retain his meagre post, between the 1680s and 1720s. &quot;The Curate of Ars&quot; (usually in French: &quot;Le Curé d&#x27;Ars&quot;) is a style often used to refer to Saint Jean Vianney, a French parish priest canonized on account of his piety and simplicity of life.

<doc id="177712" wikidata="Q315730" url="?curid=177712" title="Ronald McNair">
<text>Ronald Erwin McNair (October 21, 1950 – January 28, 1986) was an American NASA astronaut and physicist. He died at the age of 35 during the launch of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; on mission STS-51-L, in which he was serving as one of three mission specialists in a crew of seven.

Prior to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, McNair flew as a mission specialist on STS-41-B aboard &quot;Challenger&quot; from February 3 to 11, 1984, becoming the second black American in space.

== Background ==
Ronald Erwin McNair was born in Lake City, South Carolina, on October 21, 1950, to Carl C. McNair, an auto repairman, and his wife, a high school teacher named Pearl. Growing up alongside his older brother, Carl S., as well as his younger brother, Eric, McNair grew up in a low-income household, his home having lacked both electricity and running water. The family later moved into a better, though still poor-quality household following the death of McNair&#x27;s grandfather. His older brother, writing in a posthumous biography about McNair, described how the family &quot;covered the floor and furniture with pots and pans to catch the water dripping through the roof&quot; when it rained.

In the summer of 1959, McNair refused to leave the segregated Lake City Public Library without being allowed to check out his books. After the police and his mother were called, McNair was allowed to borrow books from the library; the building that housed the library at the time is now named after him. A children&#x27;s book, &quot;Ron&#x27;s Big Mission&quot;, offers a fictionalized account of this event.

McNair attended Lake City Elementary School and Carver High School, where he graduated as valedictorian in 1967.

In 1971, McNair received a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering physics, magna cum laude, from the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, North Carolina. At North Carolina A&amp;T, he studied under professor Donald Edwards, who had established the physics curriculum at the university.

In 1976, McNair received a PhD degree in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the guidance of Michael Feld, becoming nationally recognized for his work in the field of laser physics. That same year, McNair won the AAU Karate gold medal. He would subsequently win five regional championships and earn a fifth-degree black belt in karate.

McNair received four honorary doctorates, as well as a score of fellowships and commendations. He became a staff physicist at the Hughes Research Lab in Malibu, California. McNair was also a member of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity.

McNair was a member of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, which emphasizes the unity of humanity and harmony between science and religion. He first encountered the religion in Lake City, South Carolina, in the 1960s and remained a lifelong adherent. McNair even carried a book of Bahá’í prayers with him on the Challenger mission, reflecting his commitment to the faith.

==Astronaut career==
In 1978, McNair was selected as one of 35 applicants from a pool of 10,000 for the NASA astronaut program. He was one of several astronauts recruited by Nichelle Nichols as part of a NASA effort to increase the number of minority and female astronauts. McNair flew as a mission specialist on STS-41-B aboard &quot;Challenger&quot; from February 3 to 11, 1984, becoming the second African American to fly in space.

===&quot;Challenger&quot; disaster===

Following the STS-41-B mission, McNair was selected for STS-51-L as one of three mission specialists in a crew of seven. The mission launched on January 28, 1986. He and the other six crew members were killed when &quot;Challenger&quot; disintegrated nine miles above the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds after liftoff.

McNair was initially buried at Rest Lawn Memorial Park in Lake City, South Carolina. His remains were disinterred in 2004 and moved to Ronald E. McNair Memorial Park, located elsewhere in Lake City.

==Music in space==

McNair was an accomplished saxophonist and jazz enthusiast.

Before his last fateful space mission, McNair worked with French composer and performer Jean-Michel Jarre on a piece of music for Jarre&#x27;s then-upcoming album &quot;Rendez-Vous&quot;. It was intended that McNair would record his saxophone solo on board the &quot;Challenger&quot;, which would have made McNair&#x27;s solo the first original piece of music to have been recorded in space (although the song &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; had been played on a harmonica during an earlier Gemini 6 spaceflight). However, the recording was never made, as the flight ended in the disaster and the deaths of its entire crew. The final track on &quot;Rendez-Vous&quot;, &quot;Last Rendez-Vous,&quot; has the subtitle &quot;Ron&#x27;s Piece,&quot; and the liner notes include a dedication from Jarre: &quot;Ron was so excited about the piece that he rehearsed it continuously until the last moment. May the memory of my friend the astronaut and the artist Ron McNair live on through this piece.&quot; McNair was supposed to have taken part in Jarre&#x27;s &quot;Rendez-vous Houston&quot; concert through a live feed from the orbiting Shuttlecraft.

==Public honors==

McNair was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 2004, along with all crew members lost in the &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; disasters.

A variety of public places, people and programs have been renamed in honor of McNair:
* The crater McNair on the Moon is named in his honor.
* The McNair Building (a.k.a. Building 37) at MIT, his alma mater, houses the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.
* The McNair Science Center at Francis Marion University in Florence, South Carolina

* On January 29, 2011, the Lake City, South Carolina library was dedicated as the Ronald McNair Life History Center. When Ronald McNair was nine, the police and his mother were called because he wished to check out books from this library, which served only white patrons before he arrived. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ll wait,&quot; to the lady and sat on the counter until the police and his mother arrived, and the officer said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you just give him the books?&quot; which the lady behind the counter reluctantly did. He said, &quot;Thank you, ma&#x27;am,&quot; as he got the books. The episode, as recalled by his brother Carl McNair, has been depicted in a short animated film.

<text>The Coast Mountains () are a major mountain range in the Pacific Coast Ranges of western North America, extending from southwestern Yukon through the Alaska Panhandle and virtually all of the Coast of British Columbia south to the Fraser River. The mountain range&#x27;s name derives from its proximity to the sea coast, and it is often referred to as the Coast Range. The range includes volcanic and non-volcanic mountains and the extensive ice fields of the Pacific and Boundary Ranges, and the northern end of the volcanic system known as the Cascade Volcanoes. The Coast Mountains are part of a larger mountain system called the Pacific Coast Ranges or the Pacific Mountain System, which includes the Cascade Range, the Insular Mountains, the Olympic Mountains, the Oregon Coast Range, the California Coast Ranges, the Saint Elias Mountains and the Chugach Mountains. The Coast Mountains are also part of the American Cordilleraa Spanish term for an extensive chain of mountain rangesthat consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western backbone of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica.

The Coast Mountains are approximately long and average in width. The range&#x27;s southern and southeastern boundaries are surrounded by the Fraser River and the Interior Plateau while its far northwestern edge is delimited by the Kelsall and Tatshenshini Rivers at the north end of the Alaska Panhandle, beyond which are the Saint Elias Mountains, and by Champagne Pass in the Yukon Territory. Covered in dense temperate rainforest on its western exposures, the range rises to heavily glaciated peaks, including the largest temperate-latitude ice fields in the world. On its eastern flanks, the range tapers to the dry Interior Plateau and the subarctic boreal forests of the Skeena Mountains and Stikine Plateau.

The Coast Mountains are part of the Pacific Ring of Firethe ring of volcanoes and associated mountains around the Pacific Oceanand contain some of British Columbia&#x27;s highest mountains. Mount Waddington is the highest mountain of the Coast Mountains and the highest that lies entirely within British Columbia, located northeast of the head of Knight Inlet with an elevation of .

==Geography==
The Coast Mountains consists of three subdivisions known as the Pacific Ranges, the Kitimat Ranges, and the Boundary Ranges. The Pacific Ranges are the southernmost subdivision of the Coast Mountains, extending from the lower stretches of the Fraser River to Bella Coola. Included in this subdivision is four of the five major coastal icecaps in the southern Coast Mountains. These are the largest temperate-latitude icecaps in the world and fuel a number of major rivers. Other than logging and a large ski resort at the resort town of Whistler, most of the land in the range is completely undeveloped. Mount Waddington, the highest mountain of the Coast Mountains, lies in the Waddington Range of the Pacific Ranges.

Just north of the Pacific Ranges lies the central subdivision known as the Kitimat Ranges. This subdivision extends from the Bella Coola River and Burke Channel in the south to the Nass River in the north.
The third and northernmost subdivision of the Coast Mountains is the Boundary Ranges, extending from the Nass River in the south to the Kelsall River in the north. It is also the largest subdivision of the Coast Mountains, spanning the British Columbia-Alaska border and northwards into Yukon flanking the west side of the Yukon River drainage as far as Champagne Pass, north of which being the Yukon Ranges. The Boundary Ranges include several large icefields, including the Juneau Icefield between Juneau, Alaska and Atlin Lake in British Columbia, and the Stikine Icecap, which lies between the lower Stikine River and the Whiting River.

Because the Coast Mountains are just east of the Pacific Ocean, they have a profound effect on British Columbia&#x27;s climate by forcing moisture-laden air off the Pacific Ocean to rise, dropping heavy rainfalls on the western slopes where lush forests exist. This precipitation is among the heaviest in North America. The eastern slopes are relatively dry and less steep and protect the British Columbia Interior from the Pacific weather systems, resulting in dry warm summers and dry cold winters.

Beyond the eastern slopes is a plateau occupying the southern and central portions of British Columbia called the Interior Plateau. Included within the Interior Plateau is a coalescing series of layered flood basalt lava flows. These sequences of fluid volcanic rock cover about of the Interior Plateau and have a volume of about , forming a large volcanic plateau constructed atop of the Interior Plateau. North of the Interior Plateau on the range&#x27;s northeastern slopes lies a huge mountainous area known by geographers as the Interior Mountains, which includes the neighbouring Skeena, Cassiar and Hazelton Mountains.

==Geology==
===Origins and growth===
The Coast Mountains consist of deformed igneous and metamorphosed structurally complex pre-Tertiary rocks. These originated in diverse locations around the globe: the area is built of several different terranes of different ages with a broad range of tectonic origins. In addition, oceanic crust under the Pacific Ocean is being subducted at the southern portion of the range to form a north–south line of volcanoes called the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, a northern extension of the Cascade Volcanoes in the northwestern United States, and contains the most explosive young volcanoes in Canada. Further north the northwesterly structural trend of the Coast Mountains lies partly in a large continental rift responsible for the creation of several volcanoes. These volcanoes form part of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, the most volcanically active area in Canada.

====Insular and Omineca Arc eruptive periods====
The first event began 130 million years ago when a group of active volcanic islands approached a pre-existing continental margin and coastline of North America. These volcanic islands, known as the Insular Islands by geoscientists, were formed on a pre-existing tectonic plate called the Insular Plate by subduction of the former Farallon Plate to the west during the early Paleozoic era. This subduction zone records another subduction zone to the east under an ancient ocean basin between the Insular Islands and the former continental margin of North America called the Bridge River Ocean. This arrangement of two parallel subduction zones is unusual in that very few twin subduction zones exist on Earth; the Philippine Mobile Belt off the southeastern coast of Asia is an example of a modern twin subduction zone. As the Insular Plate drew closer to the pre-existing continental margin by ongoing subduction under the Bridge River Ocean, the Insular Islands drew closer to the former continental margin and coastline of western North America, supporting a pre-existing volcanic arc on the former continental margin of North America called the Omineca Arc. As the North American Plate drifted west and the Insular Plate drifted east to the old continental margin of western North America, the Bridge River Ocean eventually closed by ongoing subduction under the Bridge River Ocean. This subduction zone eventually jammed and shut down completely 115 million years ago, ending the Omineca Arc and the Insular Islands collided, forming the Insular Belt. Compression resulting from this collision crushed, fractured and folded rocks along the old continental margin. The Insular Belt then welded onto the pre-existing continental margin by magma that eventually cooled to create a large mass of igneous rock, creating a new continental margin. This large mass of igneous rock is the largest granite outcropping in North America.

====Coast Range Arc eruptive period====

The final event began when the Farallon Plate continued to subduct under the new continental margin after the Insular Plate and Insular Islands collided with the old continental margin, supporting a new continental volcanic arc called the Coast Range Arc about 100 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. Magma rising from the Farallon Plate under the new continental margin ascended through the newly accreted Insular Belt, injecting huge quantities of granite into older igneous rocks of the Insular Belt. At the surface, new volcanoes were built along the continental margin. Named after the Coast Mountains, the basement of this arc was likely Early Cretaceous and Late Jurassic intrusions from the Insular Islands.
One of the major aspects that changed early during the Coast Range Arc was the status of the northern end of the Farallon Plate, a portion now known as the Kula Plate. About 85 million years ago, the Kula Plate broke off from the Farallon Plate to form a mid-ocean ridge known to geoscientists as the Kula-Farallon Ridge. This change apparently had some important ramifications for regional geologic evolution. When this change was completed, Coast Range Arc volcanism returned and sections of the arc were uplifted considerably in latest Cretaceous time. This started a period of mountain building that affected much of western North America called the Laramide orogeny. In particular a large area of dextral transpression and southwest-directed thrust faulting was active from 75 to 66 million years ago. Much of the record of this deformation has been overridden by Tertiary age structures and the zone of Cretaceous dextral thrust faulting appears to have been widespread. It was also during this period when massive amounts of molten granite intruded highly deformed ocean rocks and assorted fragments from pre-existing island arcs, largely remnants of the Bridge River Ocean. This molten granite burned the old oceanic sediments into a glittering medium-grade metamorphic rock called schist. The older intrusions of the Coast Range Arc were then deformed under the heat and pressure of later intrusions, turning them into layered metamorphic rock known as gneiss. In some places, mixtures of older intrusive rocks and the original oceanic rocks have been distorted and warped under intense heat, weight and stress to create unusual swirled patterns known as migmatite, appearing to have been nearly melted in the procedure.

Volcanism began to decline along the length of the arc about 60 million years ago during the Albian and Aptian faunal stages of the Cretaceous period. This resulted from the changing geometry of the Kula Plate, which progressively developed a more northerly movement along the Pacific Northwest. Instead of subducting beneath the Pacific Northwest, the Kula Plate began subducting underneath southwestern Yukon and Alaska and during the early Eocene period. Volcanism along the entire length of the Coast Range Arc shut down about 50 million years ago and many of the volcanoes have disappeared from erosion. What remains of the Coast Range Arc to this day are outcrops of granite when magma intruded and cooled at depth beneath the volcanoes, forming the present Coast Mountains. During construction of intrusions 70 and 57 million years ago, the northern motion of the Kula Plate might have been between and per year. However, other geologic studies determined the Kula Plate moved at a rate as fast as per year.

<text>Mount Waddington, once known as Mystery Mountain, is the highest peak in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. Although it is lower than Mount Fairweather and Mount Quincy Adams, which straddle the United States border between Alaska and British Columbia, Mount Waddington is the highest peak that lies entirely within British Columbia. It and the subrange which surround it, known as the Waddington Range, stand at the heart of the Pacific Ranges, a remote and extremely rugged set of mountains and river valleys.

It is not as far north as its extreme Arctic-like conditions might indicate, and Mount Waddington and its attendant peaks pose some of the most serious expedition mountaineering to be had in North America — and some of the most extreme relief and spectacular mountain scenery.

From Waddington&#x27;s fang to sea level at the heads of Bute and Knight Inlets is only about 32 kilometers; across the gorges of the Homathko and the Klinaklini Rivers stand mountains almost as high, and icefields even vaster and whiter, only a few aerial miles away, with a maw deeper than the Grand Canyon, comparable in relief to the Himalayas (to which the terrain of British Columbia was compared by colonial-era travellers).

Mount Waddington is the namesake of the Mount Waddington Regional District, which takes in the seaward slope of the Waddington Range and the adjoining coastline and parts of northern Vancouver Island adjacent to Queen Charlotte Strait.

==Discovery and exploration by Europeans==

In 1925, while on a trip to Mount Arrowsmith, Vancouver Island, Don and Phyllis Munday spotted what they believed to be a peak taller than Mount Robson, the then accepted tallest peak entirely within British Columbia. In the words of Don Munday, &quot;The compass showed the alluring peak stood along a line passing a little east of Bute Inlet and perhaps 150 miles away, where blank spaces on the map left ample room for many nameless mountains.&quot; While there is debate as to whether the peak they saw was Mount Waddington (Don Munday observed that the feat is impossible), they almost certainly saw a peak in the Waddington Range, and this led the Mundays to explore that area.

Over the next decade, the Mundays mounted several expeditions into the area in an attempt to climb it. Known to them as &quot;The Mystery Mountain&quot;, in 1927 the height was measured at 13,260 feet by triangulation; they reached the lower, north-west, summit on 8 July 1928, deeming the main summit too risky. On their recommendation the Geographical Names Board of Canada named the peak Mount Waddington after Alfred Waddington who was a proponent of a road route, known as Waddington&#x27;s Road, and again later the same for a railway, via the Homathko River valley and Bute Inlet, which would connect to Vancouver Island via Seymour Narrows.

In the summer of 1934, two expeditions attempted to climb the mountain. The first expedition, made up of climbers from Winnipeg, made their attempt on the northwestern flank which had not been explored by the Mundays. After crossing Tatlayoko Lake and making their way down the Homathko River, they then spent two days constructing a bridge over Nude Creek before reaching the Tiedemann Glacier on June 23. It took them three days to reach the shoulder of Mt. Waddington at . They attempted the summit on June 28 but poor weather and route conditions on the final tower forced them to retreat, from the top. The second expedition, consisting of climbers Neal Carter, Alan Lambert, Alec Dalgleish and Eric Brooks from British Columbia, made their attempt from the southeast. On June 23, they established their base camp on the Franklin Glacier. The ascent abruptly ended three days later when Dalgleish fell to his death from the southeast ridge.

In 1935, a group of climbers from the Sierra Club of California made three attempts from their base camp at the Dais Glacier. The group failed in two attempts on the south face due to stormy conditions, poor route conditions and falling ice. Two climbers succeeded in reaching the northwest summit (first climbed by the Mundays) on a third attempt but proceeded no further.

==First ascent==
On July 4, 1936, Fritz Wiessner, Bill House, Elizabeth Woolsey and Alan Willcox reached the head of the Knight Inlet. For the next twelve days they ferried loads to their base camp at Icefall Point on the Dais Glacier. While on the glacier, they were joined by another expedition led by members of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club and the Sierra Club. Wiessner and House agreed to allow the others a first chance at the summit but this group failed to find a route up the south face.

On July 20, Wiessner and House first attempted the line of a great couloir that comes directly down between the main summit tower and the northwest peak. It was an excellent line for quickly ascending but they were unable to traverse onto the south face proper due to poor rock conditions and were forced to retreat to base camp. By 3 am the next morning they were already climbing up a couloir to the right of the face. Good weather the past few days had cleared most of the snow away from the ledges making for good climbing conditions. Following the left branch of the couloir, they reached a snow patch in the middle of the face. The final of the south face then presented a fierce hurdle of &quot;sheer forbidding-looking rocks&quot; as noted by Wiessner. While Wiessner initially started in boots, he quickly changed to rope-soled shoes and gave his ice axe and extra rope to House. Wiessner led several pitches up technically difficult rock including several overhangs. After traversing east across the face they rested on a ledge just below the southeastern ridge, a full 9 hours since leaving the snow patch on the south face. After climbing a short chimney they finally reached the small snowy mass at the top, 13 hours after their start in base camp. They aborted their earlier plan of descending the shorter north face and retraced their ascent line, reaching their tent on the Dais Glacier at 2 am. The ascent to the summit and back to base camp had taken over 23 hours.

==Notable ascents==
* 1936 &quot;South Face&quot; FA by Fritz Wiessner and Bill House.
* 1942 &quot;South Face&quot; 2nd ascent by Helmut and Fred Beckey.
* 1960 &quot;Bravo Glacier&quot; ascent by Elfrida Pigou who did not summit after being killed by an avalanche.
* 1977 &quot;South Face variation&quot; FA of route, 3rd ascent of south face by Jack Tackle and Kenneth Currens.
* 2012 &quot;Flavelle-Lane Route&quot; First solo ascent of the peak by Colin Haley.
* 2019 The first &quot;complete traverse of the West Ridge&quot; by Simon Richardson and Ian Welsted who completed a 12km traverse of Mount Waddington, starting from Fury Gap at its western end, crossing bith the north-west and main summits and finishing at Rainy Knob on the eastern side of the mountain.

== Climate ==
The Waddington Range massif is known for fierce as well as unpredictable weather, located as it is at the brunt of the warm, wet winds that soak the British Columbia Coast, of which it is the highest point. Precipitation levels in the area of the peak are among the highest in the Coast Mountains. The peak has an ice cap climate (EF).

In 2010 and again in 2023, scientists successfully drilled ice cores at Combatant Col, the saddle between Mt. Waddington and Combatant Mountain, to obtain a climate and environmental record from the ice covering the last few hundred years. The 2023 core reached 219 meters in depth, at or near the base of the ice.

== Access ==
To reach Mount Waddington, one could take a long approach originating from Vancouver, with the bulk of the journey consisting of a long boat ride through the Strait of Georgia and the Knight Inlet, taking up to three days. A shorter water approach from Port McNeill, British Columbia, a northern community of Vancouver Island accessible by scheduled daily air connections and/or road from Victoria, reducing the water journey to less than a day may be undertaken.

Alternately trails and rough roads do exist from the Chilcotin side of the range, and may be accessed via BC Highway 20, from Williams Lake, departing from the main route to Bella Coola at Tatla Lake to connect to the Homathko River and up a side creek or glacier from there. This inland route is also the access route for the neighbouring Niut and Pantheon Ranges.

Mount Waddington is a popular destination among mountain climbers since it is the highest peak in the Coast Mountains and a challenging climb. It has been compared to Mont Blanc&#x27;s structure.

<text>Pythagorean comma on C using Ben Johnston&#x27;s notation. The note depicted as lower on the staff (B+++) is slightly higher in pitch (than C).

In musical tuning, the Pythagorean comma (or ditonic comma), named after the ancient mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras, is the small interval (or comma) existing in Pythagorean tuning between two enharmonically equivalent notes such as C and B, or D and C. It is equal to the frequency ratio = ≈ 1.01364, or about 23.46 cents, roughly a quarter of a semitone (in between 75:74 and 74:73). The comma that musical temperaments often &quot;temper&quot; is the Pythagorean comma.

The Pythagorean comma can be also defined as the difference between a Pythagorean apotome and a Pythagorean limma (i.e., between a chromatic and a diatonic semitone, as determined in Pythagorean tuning); the difference between 12 just perfect fifths and seven octaves; or the difference between three Pythagorean ditones and one octave. (This is why the Pythagorean comma is also called a &quot;ditonic comma&quot;.)

The diminished second, in Pythagorean tuning, is defined as the difference between limma and apotome. It coincides, therefore, with the opposite of a Pythagorean comma, and can be viewed as a &quot;descending&quot; Pythagorean comma (e.g. from C to D), equal to about −23.46 cents.

==Derivation==
As described in the introduction, the Pythagorean comma may be derived in multiple ways:

* Difference between two enharmonically equivalent notes in a Pythagorean scale, such as C and B, or D and C (see below).
* Difference between Pythagorean apotome and Pythagorean limma.
* Difference between 12 just perfect fifths and seven octaves.
* Difference between three Pythagorean ditones (major thirds) and one octave.

A just perfect fifth has a frequency ratio of 3:2. It is used in Pythagorean tuning, together with the octave, as a yardstick to define, with respect to a given initial note, the frequency of any other note.

Apotome and limma are the two kinds of semitones defined in Pythagorean tuning. Namely, the apotome (about 113.69 cents, e.g. from C to C) is the chromatic semitone, or augmented unison (A1), while the limma (about 90.23 cents, e.g. from C to D) is the diatonic semitone, or minor second (m2).

A ditone (or major third) is an interval formed by two major tones. In Pythagorean tuning, a major tone has a size of about 203.9 cents (frequency ratio 9:8), thus a Pythagorean ditone is about 407.8 cents.

| caption = Pythagorean comma as twelve justly tuned perfect fifths in Ben Johnston notation

The Pythagorean comma can also be thought of as the discrepancy between 12 justly tuned perfect fifths (ratio 3:2) and seven octaves (ratio 2:1):

:formula_3

In the following table of musical scales in the circle of fifths, the Pythagorean comma is visible as the small interval between, e.g., F and G. Going around the circle of fifths with just intervals results in a comma pump by the Pythagorean comma.

The 6 and the 6 scales are not identical—even though they are on the piano keyboard—but the scales are one Pythagorean comma lower. Disregarding this difference leads to enharmonic change.

This interval has serious implications for the various tuning schemes of the chromatic scale, because in Western music, 12 perfect fifths and seven octaves are treated as the same interval. Equal temperament, today the most common tuning system in the West, reconciled this by flattening each fifth by a twelfth of a Pythagorean comma (approximately 2 cents), thus producing perfect octaves.

Another way to express this is that the just fifth has a frequency ratio (compared to the tonic) of 3:2 or 1.5 to 1, whereas the seventh semitone (based on 12 equal logarithmic divisions of an octave) is the seventh power of the twelfth root of two or 1.4983... to 1, which is not quite the same (a difference of about 0.1%). Take the just fifth to the 12th power, then subtract seven octaves, and you get the Pythagorean comma (about a 1.4% difference).

==History==
The first to mention the comma&#x27;s proportion of 531441:524288 was Euclid, who takes as a basis the whole tone of Pythagorean tuning with the ratio of 9:8, the octave with the ratio of 2:1, and a number A = 262144. He concludes that raising this number by six whole tones yields a value, G, that is larger than that yielded by raising it by an octave (two times A). He gives G to be 531441. The necessary calculations read:

Calculation of G:
::formula_4

Calculation of the double of A:
::formula_5

Chinese mathematicians were aware of the Pythagorean comma as early as 122 BC (its calculation is detailed in the &quot;Huainanzi&quot;), and circa 50 BC, Ching Fang discovered that if the cycle of perfect fifths were continued beyond 12 all the way to 53, the difference between this 53rd pitch and the starting pitch would be much smaller than the Pythagorean comma. This much smaller interval was later named Mercator&#x27;s comma (&quot;see: history of 53 equal temperament&quot;).

In George Russell&#x27;s &quot;Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization&quot; (1953), the half step between the Lydian Tonic and 2 in his Altered Major and Minor Auxiliary Diminished Blues scales is theoretically based on the Pythagorean comma.

<doc id="177725" wikidata="Q17097785" url="?curid=177725" title="Magic and religion">
<text>People who believe in magic can be found in all societies, regardless of whether they have organized religious hierarchies, including formal clergy, or more informal systems. Such concepts tend to appear more frequently in cultures based in polytheism, animism, or shamanism. Religion and magic became conceptually separated in the West where the distinction arose between supernatural events sanctioned by approved religious doctrine versus magic rooted in other religious sources. With the rise of Christianity this became characterised with the contrast between divine miracles versus folk religion, superstition, or occult speculation.

==Distinction==
Early sociological interpretations of magic by Marcel Mauss and Henri Hubert emphasized the social conditions in which the phenomenon of magic develops. According to them, religion is the expression of a social structure and serves to maintain the cohesion of a community (religion is therefore public) and magic is an individualistic action (and therefore private).

Ralph Merrifield, the British archaeologist credited as producing the first full-length volume dedicated to a material approach to magic, defined the differences between religion and magic:
&quot;&#x27;Religion&#x27; is used to indicate the belief in supernatural or spiritual beings; &#x27;magic&#x27;, the use of practices intended to bring occult forces under control and so to influence events; &#x27;ritual&#x27;, prescribed or customary behaviour that may be religious, if it is intended to placate or win favour of supernatural beings, magical if it is intended to operate through impersonal forces of sympathy or by controlling supernatural beings, or social if its purpose is to reinforce a social organisation or facilitate social intercourse&quot;.

In 1991 Henk Versnel argued that magic and religion function in different ways and that these can be broadly defined in four areas: Intention – magic is employed to achieve clear and immediate goals for an individual, whereas religion is less purpose-motivated and has its sights set on longer-term goals; Attitude – magic is manipulative as the process is in the hands of the user, &quot;instrumental coercive manipulation&quot;, opposed to the religious attitude of &quot;personal and supplicative negotiation&quot;; Action – magic is a technical exercise that often requires professional skills to fulfil an action, whereas religion is not dependent upon these factors but the will and sentiment of the gods; Social – the goals of magic run counter to the interests of a society (in that personal gain for an individual gives them an unfair advantage over peers), whereas religion has more benevolent and positive social functions.

==Connection==
This separation of the terms &#x27;religion&#x27; and &#x27;magic&#x27; in a functional sense is disputed. It has been argued that abandoning the term magic in favour of discussing &quot;belief in spiritual beings&quot; will help to create a more meaningful understanding of all associated ritual practices. However using the word &#x27;magic&#x27; alongside &#x27;religion&#x27; is one method of trying to understand the supernatural world, even if some other term can eventually take its place.

It is a postulate of modern anthropology, at least since early 1930s, that there is complete continuity between magic and religion.

Robert Ranulph Marett (1932) said:

Ernst Cassirer (1944) wrote:

In ancient Egypt, the religion held that the gods&#x27; actions maintained &quot;maat&quot; and created and sustained all living things. They did this work using a force the Egyptians called &quot;heka&quot;, a term usually translated as &quot;magic&quot;. &quot;Heka&quot; was a fundamental power that the creator god used to form the world and the gods themselves. Magic (personified as the god &quot;heka&quot;) was an integral part of religion and culture which is known to us through a substantial corpus of texts which are products of the Egyptian tradition. While the category magic has been contentious for modern Egyptology, there is clear support for its applicability from ancient terminology. The Coptic term &quot;hik&quot; is the descendant of the pharaonic term &quot;heka&quot;, which, unlike its Coptic counterpart, had no connotation of impiety or illegality, and is attested from the Old Kingdom through to the Roman era. &quot;Heka&quot; was considered morally neutral and was applied to the practices and beliefs of both foreigners and Egyptians alike. The Instructions for Merikare informs us that &quot;heka&quot; was a beneficence gifted by the creator to humanity &quot;... in order to be weapons to ward off the blow of events&quot;. Magic was practiced by both the literate priestly hierarchy and by illiterate farmers and herdsmen, and the principle of &quot;heka&quot; underlay all ritual activity, both in the temples and in private settings.

The English word magic has its origins in ancient Greece.
During the late sixth and early fifth centuries BCE, the Persian &quot;maguš&quot; was Graecicized and introduced into the ancient Greek language as &quot;μάγος&quot; and &quot;μαγεία&quot;. In doing so it transformed meaning, gaining negative connotations, with the &quot;magos&quot; being regarded as a charlatan whose ritual practices were fraudulent, strange, unconventional, and dangerous. As noted by Davies, for the ancient Greeks—and subsequently for the ancient Romans—&quot;magic was not distinct from religion but rather an unwelcome, improper expression of it—the religion of the other&quot;. The historian Richard Gordon suggested that for the ancient Greeks, being accused of practicing magic was &quot;a form of insult&quot;. Pliny the Elder seems to acknowledge that Magi are priests of a foreign religion, along the lines of the druids of the Celts in Britain and Gaul.

Connotations of magic have varied from positive to negative at times throughout history, Within Western culture, magic has been linked to ideas of the Other, foreignness, and primitivism; indicating that it is &quot;a powerful marker of cultural difference&quot; and likewise, a non-modern phenomenon. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Western intellectuals perceived the practice of magic to be a sign of a primitive mentality and also commonly attributed it to marginalised groups of people.

==Intersections==
Even in places and times where magic and religion are considered distinct, separate concepts there have been numerous historical intersections where aspects from one would be syncretized with or borrowed from the other.
=== Rituals ===
Both magic and religion contain rituals. Most cultures have or have had in their past some form of magical tradition that recognizes a shamanistic interconnectedness of spirit. This may have been long ago, as a folk tradition that died out with the establishment of a major world religion, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam or Buddhism, or it may still co-exist with that world religion. Coptic Christians were writing magical spells from the 1st to 12th centuries.

=== Names of the gods as true names ===

There is a long-standing belief in the power of true names, this often descends from the magical belief that knowing a being&#x27;s true name grants power over it.

If names have power, then knowing the name of a god regarded as supreme in a religion should grant the greatest power of all. This belief is reflected in traditional Wicca, where the names of the Goddess and the Horned God – the two supreme deities in Wicca – are usually held as a secret to be revealed only to initiates. This belief is also reflected in ancient Judaism, which used the Tetragrammaton (YHWH, usually translated as &quot;Lord&quot; in small caps) to refer to God in the Tanakh. The same belief is seen in Hinduism, but with different conclusions; rather, attaining transcendence and the power of God is seen as a &quot;good&quot; thing. Thus, some Hindus chant the name of their favorite deities as often as possible, the most common being Krishna.

===Magic and Abrahamic religions===
Magic and Abrahamic religions have had a somewhat checkered past. The King James Version of the Bible included the famous translation &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&quot; (Exodus 22:18), and Saul is rebuked by God for seeking advice from a diviner who could contact spirits. On the other hand, seemingly magical signs are documented in the Bible: For example, both the staff of Pharaoh&#x27;s sorcerers as well as the staff of Moses and Aaron could be turned into snakes (Exodus 7:8-13). However, as Scott Noegel points out, the critical difference between the magic of Pharaoh&#x27;s magicians and the non-magic of Moses is in the means by which the staff becomes a snake. For the Pharaoh&#x27;s magicians, they employed &quot;their secret arts&quot; whereas Moses merely throws down his staff to turn it into a snake. To an ancient Egyptian, the startling difference would have been that Moses neither employed secret arts nor magical words. In the Torah, Noegel points out that YHWH does not need magical rituals to act.

The words &#x27;witch&#x27; and &#x27;witchcraft&#x27; appear in some English versions of the Bible. Exodus 22:18 in the King James Version reads: &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot; The precise meaning of the Hebrew word &quot;mechshepha&quot; (root &quot;kashaph&quot;) here translated as &#x27;witch&#x27; and in some other modern versions, &#x27;sorceress&#x27;, is uncertain. In the Septuagint it was translated as &quot;pharmakeia&quot;, meaning &#x27;pharmacy&#x27;, and on this basis, Reginald Scot claimed in the 16th century that &#x27;witch&#x27; was an incorrect translation and poisoners were intended.

<text>Herbert Manfred &quot;Zeppo&quot; Marx (February 25, 1901 – November 30, 1979) was an American comedic actor. He was the youngest, and last survivor, of the five Marx Brothers. He appeared in the first five Marx Brothers feature films from 1929 to 1933, and then left the act for careers as an engineer and theatrical agent.

==Early life==
Marx was born in Manhattan. His parents were Sam Marx (called &quot;Frenchie&quot; throughout his life) and Minnie Schönberg Marx, both Jewish. Minnie&#x27;s brother was Al Shean, who later gained fame as half of the vaudeville team Gallagher and Shean. His mother was from East Frisia in Germany and his father was a tailor from Alsace, France.

==Name==
As with all of the Marx Brothers, various theories exist regarding the origin of Zeppo&#x27;s stage name. His older brother Groucho said in his Carnegie Hall concert in 1972 that the name was derived from the Zeppelin airship, and Zeppo&#x27;s ex-wife Barbara Sinatra repeated this claim in her 2011 book &quot;Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank&quot;. In his 1961 autobiography &quot;Harpo Speaks!&quot;, older brother Harpo said that there was a trained chimpanzee named Mr. Zippo that Herbert would imitate, but when Herbert objected to being named after a chimp, it was altered to Zeppo. In a rare television interview years later, Zeppo said that &quot;Zep&quot; was Italian-American slang for &quot;baby&quot;, and the name fit as he was the youngest of the brothers.

==Career==
===Early career and the Marx Brothers===
Zeppo replaced brother Gummo in the Marx Brothers&#x27; stage act when Gummo was drafted into the army in 1918. Zeppo had been employed as a mechanic for the Ford Motor Company. He had no desire for a show business career, but Minnie Marx insisted that he replace Gummo because she wanted to maintain the act as a foursome. Zeppo remained with the team in vaudeville, Broadway and the first five Marx Brothers films as the straight man and romantic lead until leaving the act following &quot;Duck Soup&quot; in 1933. He also appeared without his brothers in a minor role the Adolphe Menjou comedy &quot;A Kiss in the Dark&quot; (1925), billed as Herbert Marx. His performance was praised by the &quot;New York Sun&quot;.

Barbara Sinatra said that he was considered too young to perform with his brothers, but when Gummo joined the army, Zeppo was asked to join the act as a last-minute replacement at a show in Texas. He and a Jewish friend were supposed to have a date with two Irish girls, but Zeppo canceled in order to board the train to Texas. His friend was shot several hours later by a gang that disapproved of Jews dating Irish girls.

Having watched his brothers for many years, Zeppo could imitate and replace any of the others when illness kept them from performing live on stage.
Groucho said: &quot;He was so good as Captain Spaulding in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; that I would have let him play the part indefinitely if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience.&quot; However, Zeppo did not develop his own comic persona to play against those of his brothers. Critic Percy Hammond wrote in 1928:
One of the handicaps to the thorough enjoyment of the Marx Brothers in their merry escapades is the plight of poor Zeppo Marx. While Groucho, Harpo, and Chico are hogging the show, as the phrase has it, their brother hides in an insignificant role, peeping out now and then to listen to plaudits in which he has no share.

Zeppo did impersonate one of his brothers -- only once -- in a movie. There was a day during the filming of &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; when Groucho couldn&#x27;t appear. The scene being filmed was Groucho and Margaret Dumont discussing strange noises during the theft of a painting. Zeppo stepped in, wearing Groucho&#x27;s costume and makeup, and the scene was rigged so there was a power failure. Thus the action could be filmed almost in darkness, hiding the deception. The giveaway is when &quot;Groucho&quot; turns his head to investigate the noises, the light catches Zeppo&#x27;s distinctive profile. 

The popular assumption that Zeppo&#x27;s character was superfluous was fueled in part by Groucho. According to Groucho&#x27;s own story, when the group became the Three Marx Brothers, the studio wanted to trim their collective salary, and Groucho replied, &quot;We&#x27;re twice as funny without Zeppo!&quot;

Zeppo was mechanically adept and largely responsible for keeping the Marx family car running. He later owned Marman Products Co., which machined parts for the war effort during World War II. The company produced a motorcycle called the Marman Twin as well as the Marman clamps used to hold the atomic bombs inside the B-29 bombers &quot;Enola Gay&quot; and &quot;Bockscar&quot;. He obtained patents for a wristwatch that monitored pulse rate and sounded an alarm if the heartbeat became irregular, and a therapeutic pad for delivering moist heat to a patient.

The 2024 book by Robert S Bader &quot;Zeppo: The Reluctant Marx Brother&quot; said that Zeppo was deeply associated with gangsters, and was called to testify before a grand jury in 1958 about missing funds in a gambling syndicate. According to Bader his brothers were so worried about his associates and high-stakes gambling that they considered disowning him; but they were always personally close.

After retiring from the screen, Zeppo founded a large theatrical agency with his brother Gummo and they represented numerous screenwriters and actors, including their brothers.

==Personal life==

Zeppo introduced Mary Livingstone to Jack Benny during a Passover seder; they married in 1926.

On April 12, 1927, Zeppo married Marion Benda (née Bimberg). They adopted two children, Timothy and Thomas, in 1944 and 1945, and divorced on May 12, 1954. On September 18, 1959, Zeppo married Barbara Blakeley. He wanted to adopt and give his surname to her son Bobby Oliver, but Bobby&#x27;s father would not allow it. However, Bobby did later use the last name of Marx.

Barbara, a Methodist, wrote in her book &quot;Lady Blue Eyes&quot; that Zeppo never forced her to convert to Judaism, but that he told her that she became Jewish by &quot;injection.&quot; Barbara also wrote that Zeppo wanted to keep her son at a distance and added a guest house separated from the main residence for him. Zeppo was reportedly pleased when the boy was sent to military school.

Zeppo owned a house on Halper Lake Drive in Rancho Mirage, California, near the residence of Frank Sinatra. Along with his brothers Groucho and Harpo, Zeppo was a member of the Hillcrest Country Club with friends such as Sinatra, George Burns, Jack Benny, Danny Kaye, Sid Caesar and Milton Berle.

Barbara became involved with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and had arranged to show &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960) for charity, selling tickets and organizing a post-screening ball. At the last minute, Barbara was told that she could not show the film, so Zeppo spoke to Sinatra, who gave them an early release of the recently completed &quot;Come Blow Your Horn&quot;. Sinatra also flew everyone involved to Palm Springs for the event.

Sinatra began to invite Barbara and Zeppo to his house two or three times per week, and often sent champagne and wine to their home. Barbara and Sinatra began a love affair without Zeppo&#x27;s knowledge, and the tabloid newspapers published photos showing them together. Barbara and Sinatra denied the affair until after she and Zeppo divorced in 1973.

In the divorce settlement, Zeppo allowed Barbara to keep a 1969 Jaguar car, and agreed to pay her US$1,500 () per month for 10 years. Barbara and Frank Sinatra continued to date and were hounded by the press until her divorce became final; they married in 1976.

In 1973, 37-year old Jean Bodul, the future wife of mobster Jimmy Fratianno, accused Zeppo of assaulting her; she sued and a jury awarded her $20,690 in 1978 ().

Zeppo became ill with cancer in 1978. The disease went into remission but returned. An ailing Zeppo turned to his former wife Barbara for support and she accompanied him to medical appointments and treatment sessions. He spent his last days with her family.

==Death==
Zeppo died of lung cancer at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage on November 30, 1979, at the age of 78. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

In his will, Zeppo left stepson Bobby Marx a few possessions and enough money to finish law school. Frank and Barbara Sinatra attended his funeral.

==Legacy==
Several critics have challenged the notion that Zeppo did not develop a comic persona in his films. James Agee considered Zeppo &quot;a peerlessly cheesy improvement on the traditional straight man.&quot; Along similar lines, Gerald Mast, in his book &quot;The Comic Mind: Comedy and Movies&quot;, noted that Zeppo&#x27;s comedic persona, while certainly more subtle than his brothers&#x27;, was undeniably present:

[He] added a fourth dimension as the cliché of the [romantic] juvenile, the bland wooden espouser of sentiments that seem to exist only in the world of the sound stage. ... [He is] too schleppy, too nasal, and too wooden to be taken seriously.

Reviewing the 1924 play &quot;I&#x27;ll Say She Is&quot;, &quot;The New York Daily News&quot; called Zeppo &quot;the obliging audience of the family – the feeder who helps his brothers be funny by playing straight himself.&quot; When &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the brothers&#x27; debut film &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; in 1929, it ranked all four Marx Brothers equally: &quot;When the four Marx brothers are on the screen, it&#x27;s a riot.&quot; The review also described each brother&#x27;s unique style of comedy and praised Zeppo as &quot;the handsome but dogged straight man with the charisma of an enamel washstand.&quot;

In his essay &quot;The Marx Brothers: From Vaudeville to Hollywood,&quot; Robert S. Bader observed that the Marx Brothers as a trio without Zeppo should be considered a different comedy team. He noted that &quot;changes in the Marx Brothers&#x27; screen personas [were] immediate and apparent&quot; with fewer vaudevillian elements, more in tune with standard Hollywood comedies in which &quot;love stories [were] injected in the plots [to] make their films more palatable to female moviegoers.&quot; He noted Zeppo&#x27;s absence in the brothers&#x27; new act:

Their zaniness and anarchy would be heavily diluted at M-G-M as the studio found them a wider audience. … These are not vaudeville&#x27;s Marx Brothers. But in the Paramount films they certainly are the Marx Brothers of the stage – the FOUR Marx Brothers, as Minnie intended them to be. While Zeppo may not be as busy as his brothers, they function best as a quartet. Groucho may have had other capable straight men, but when Zeppo takes a letter to the honorable Charles H. Hoongerdoonger, Marx Brothers fans know he&#x27;s the best man for the job. … Those five films are one of the last links to the era when vaudeville was the primary form of entertainment in America – and the Four Marx Brothers were packing vaudeville theaters across the country. Of course they were still great as a trio in their later films, but if you want to know what it was like to see them on stage, you need to start with four of them – and their first five films.

In her book &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going: Groucho &amp; His Friends&quot;, Charlotte Chandler defended Zeppo as &quot;the Marx Brothers&#x27; interpreter in the worlds they invaded. He was neither totally a straight man nor totally a comedian, but combined elements of both, as did Margaret Dumont. Zeppo&#x27;s importance to the Marx Brothers&#x27; initial success was as a Marx Brother who could &#x27;pass&#x27; as a normal person. None of Zeppo&#x27;s replacements (Allan Jones, Tony Martin and others) could assume this character as convincingly as Zeppo, because they were actors, and Zeppo was the real thing, cast to type.&quot; Chandler&#x27;s appraisal of Zeppo&#x27;s role in the films—as an &quot;interpreter&quot; for his older brothers to the audience—was essentially confirmed by Groucho, who once noted that Zeppo&#x27;s role was &quot;handsome, obtuse, slightly wooden&quot; and that he &quot;brought logic to a basically illogical story,&quot; acting as &quot;an intrusion&quot; to their otherwise complete anarchy.

Zeppo&#x27;s comic persona was further highlighted in the dictation scene of &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;. In his book &quot;Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Sometimes Zeppo&quot;, Joe Adamson analyzed the scene, detailing how it revealed Zeppo&#x27;s ability to best Groucho with simple rebuttals. In the scene, Groucho dictates a letter to his lawyer, which Zeppo writes. Adamson noted:

There is a common assumption that Zeppo = Zero, which this scene does its best to contradict. Groucho dictating a letter to anybody else would hardly be cause for rejoicing. We have to believe that someone will be there to accept all his absurdities and even respond somewhat in kind before things can progress free from conflict into this genial mishmash. Groucho clears his throat in the midst of his dictation, and Zeppo asks him if he wants that in the letter. Groucho says, &#x27;No, put it in the envelope.&#x27; Zeppo nods. And only Zeppo could even try such a thing as taking down the heading and the salutation and leaving out the letter because it didn&#x27;t sound important to him. It takes a Marx Brother to pull something like that on a Marx Brother and get away with it.

In the same book, Adamson noted Zeppo&#x27;s position as the campy parody of the juvenile romantic in &quot;Horse Feathers:&quot;

Each Marx Brother has his own form of comedy. Zeppo is at his funniest when he opens his mouth and sings. It has taken forty years, of course, for the full humor to come across. For a normal comedian this may be bad timing, but for a Marx Brother it&#x27;s immortality. Almost every crooner of 1932 looks stilted and awkward now, but with Zeppo, who was never very convincing in the first place, the effect crosses the threshold into lovable comedy. &quot;I think you&#x27;re wonderful!&quot; he oozes charmingly to Thelma Todd, and we &quot;know&quot; he never met her before shooting started.

Critic Danél Griffin, who praised Zeppo as &quot;that great comic parody of the schleppy juvenile role of the 1920s/30s musicals,&quot; believed that the onscreen dynamic between Groucho and Zeppo was one of the &quot;key relationships between the individual Marx Brothers [that] shape their comedic strategy, not counting when the four of them are onstage together.&quot; Griffin wrote that Zeppo would often offer ideas that Groucho would cultivate into comedic routines:

Zeppo&#x27;s onscreen relationship with Groucho has always been tricky to ascertain; Zeppo is generally Groucho&#x27;s aloof secretary in their films, but he is seemingly capable of reducing Groucho to stunned silence with simple, plain-English rebuttals (see &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;) when Chico&#x27;s snappy comebacks only fuel Groucho’s insults all the more. … Zeppo&#x27;s parts are usually small, but he performs exactly what is required of him as an outwardly wooden fellow who is incapable of being rattled by a man whose business is to rattle.

Allen W. Ellis wrote in his article &quot;Yes, Sir: The Legacy of Zeppo Marx&quot;:

Indeed, Zeppo is a link between the audience and Groucho, Harpo and Chico. In a sense, he &quot;is&quot; us on the screen. He knows who those guys are and what they are capable of. As he ambles out of a scene, perhaps it is to watch them do their business, to come back in as necessary to move the film along, and again to join in the celebration of the finish. Further, Zeppo is crucial to the absurdity of the Paramount films. The humor is in his incongruity. Typically he dresses like a normal person, in stark contrast to Groucho&#x27;s greasepaint and &#x27;formal&#x27; attire, Harpo&#x27;s rags, and Chico&#x27;s immigrant hand-me-downs. By most accounts, he is the handsomest of the brothers, yet that handsomeness is distorted by his familial resemblance to the others – sure, he&#x27;s handsome, but it is a decidedly peculiar, Marxian handsomeness. By making the group four, Zeppo adds symmetry, and in the surrealistic worlds of the Paramount films, this symmetry upsets rather than confirms balance: it is chaos born of symmetry. That he is a plank in a maelstrom, along with the very concept of &#x27;this guy&#x27; who is there for no real reason, who joins in and is accepted by these other three wildmen while the narrative offers no explanation, are wonderful in their pure absurdity. &#x27;To string things together in a seemingly purposeless way,&#x27; said Mark Twain, &#x27;and to be seemingly unaware that they are absurd, is the mark of American humor.&#x27; The &#x27;sense&#x27; injected into the nonsense only compounds the nonsense.

In a eulogy for Zeppo written in 1979 for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, columnist Tom Zito wrote:

Thank goodness for Zeppo, who never really cracked a joke on screen. At least not directly. He just took it from Groucho, in more ways than one. ... If Groucho, Chico and Harpo were the funny guys, Zeppo was the Everyman, the loser who&#x27;d come running out of the grocery store only to find the meter maid sticking the parking ticket on his Hungadunga.

In Marc Eliot&#x27;s 2005 biography of Cary Grant, Eliot wrote that as a teenager, Grant favored Zeppo:

While the rest of the country preferred Groucho, Zeppo, the good-looking straight man and romantic lead, was Archie&#x27;s favorite, the one whose foil timing he believed was the real key to the act&#x27;s success. Not long after, Archie began to augment his already well-practiced &quot;suave&quot; Fairbanks look and dress with a Zeppo-like fancy bowtie (called a jazz-bow, or jazzbo, during the Roaring Twenties) and copied his brilliantine hairstyle, adding Dixie Peach, a favorite pomade of American black performers and show business leads, by the palmful to his thick dark mop, to give it a molded, comb-streaked blue-black Zeppo sheen.

In his book &quot;The Anarchy of the Imagination: Interviews, Essays, Notes&quot;, filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder included Zeppo among the ten greatest film actors of all time.

In a June 2016 review of an Off-Broadway revival of &quot;I&#x27;ll Say She Is&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Adam Gopnik wrote:

Matt [Walters], becoming Zeppo, is a reminder that the Marxes were never quite as good again after they lost their one straight man. The object of the Marxes&#x27; comedy is anarchy, but its subject is fraternity: they are in it together to the end. Zeppo&#x27;s inclusion in the family made the others less like clowns and more like brothers.

==In popular culture==
In an episode of the television series &quot;Cheers&quot;, Lilith Crane says that Zeppo was her favorite Marx brother.

A third-season episode of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; is titled &quot;The Zeppo&quot; and focuses on the perspective of character Xander Harris, whose position as the least impressive or capable member of the cast is compared to the similar perception of Zeppo Marx.

The &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; character TV&#x27;s Frank revealed in Episode 323 featuring &quot;Sax Rohmer&#x27;s The Castle of Fu Manchu&quot; that while he was working at Arby&#x27;s, he was given the nickname of Zeppo because of his supposed sense of humor.

<text>Romance is a 1930 American Pre-Code film directed by Clarence Brown, and starring Greta Garbo, Lewis Stone, and Gavin Gordon. Based on the 1913 play by Edward Sheldon, the film was written by Edwin Justus Mayer and Bess Meredyth, and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

The play was previously adapted as a 1920 silent film starring Doris Keane, the actress in Sheldon&#x27;s 1913 play.

==Plot==
On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Harry tells his grandfather, a bishop, that he intends to marry an actress, even though that is frowned upon by his social class. However, his grandfather recounts via flashback a cautionary tale of a great love affair with a &quot;fallen woman&quot; during his own youth.

When he is 28 years old, Tom Armstrong, the son of an aristocratic family and the rector of St. Giles, meets the famous Italian opera star Rita Cavallini at an evening party given by Cornelius Van Tuyl. Tom falls in love with Rita even though there are rumors that she is Van Tuyl&#x27;s mistress. Tom&#x27;s family disapproves of Rita, but he continues to pursue her until he discovers that she has been lying to him about the true nature of her relationship with Van Tuyl. Though he forgives and loves her, their different lives and different social classes make an engagement untenable. Ultimately, Tom marries Harry&#x27;s grandmother.

In a surprise ending, he counsels Harry to marry the woman he loves, regardless of the consequences.

==Cast==


==Reception==
&quot;Romance&quot; cost $496,000 and grossed $733,000 in the United States and $523,000 in other markets, the worldwide gross was $1,256,000, and it made a profit of $287,000.

Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Greta Garbo&#x27;s performance in &quot;Romance&quot; is perhaps as good as anything she has done on the screen.&quot; Norbert Lusk of the movie magazine &quot;Picture Play&quot; wrote that Garbo&#x27;s performance &quot;is a thing of pure beauty, an inspiring blend of intellect and emotion, a tender, poignant, poetic portrait of a woman who thrusts love from her because she considers herself unworthy of the man who offers it.&quot;

==Accolades==
&quot;Romance&quot; received two nominations at the 3rd Academy Awards: Best Director for Brown, and Best Actress for Garbo.

<text>Their Own Desire is a 1929 American pre-Code romantic drama film directed by E. Mason Hopper and starring Norma Shearer, Belle Bennett, Lewis Stone, Robert Montgomery, and Helene Millard. The film was adapted by James Forbes and Frances Marion from the novel by Sarita Fuller (pseudonym of Beulah Marie Dix); Lucille Newmark wrote the titles. It is also the last MGM film in the 1920s. Shearer was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, but lost to herself for &quot;The Divorcee&quot;.

==Premise==
A young woman is upset by the knowledge that her father is divorcing her mother in order to marry another woman. Her own feelings change, however, when she falls in love with a young man who turns out to be the son of her father&#x27;s new love.

==Cast==
* Norma Shearer as Lucia &#x27;Lally&#x27; Marlett
* Belle Bennett as Harriet Marlett
* Lewis Stone as Henry Marlett
* Robert Montgomery as John Douglas Cheever
* Helene Millard as Beth Cheever
* Cecil Cunningham as Aunt Caroline Elrick
* Henry Hebert as Uncle Nate Elrick
* Mary Doran as Suzanne Elrick

* Isabelle Keith as Isabelle, a Polo Player / Snooty Dinner Guest (uncredited)
* Kane Richmond as Man at the Resort (uncredited)
* Oscar Rudolph as Man at the Resort (uncredited)

==Production==
The pool scenes in which John Cheever meets Lally Marlett for the first time were filmed at the Norconian Resort Supreme competition diving and swimming pools. While the diving boards and three diving platforms are long gone, the two Norconian pools are still intact, though worse for wear as of 2008, in the middle of what is now the California Rehabilitation Center in Norco, California.

<text>The Trespasser is a 1929 American pre-Code film written and directed by Edmund Goulding and starring Gloria Swanson, Robert Ames, Purnell Pratt, Henry B. Walthall, and Wally Albright. The film was released by United Artists in both silent and sound versions.

==Plot==
Marion Donnell, a stenographer in Chicago (Gloria Swanson) elopes with wealthy Jack Merrick (Robert Ames). Their marriage is opposed by his father (William Holden) who considers Marion a fortune-hunter and demands that Jack have the marriage annulled. Marion, furious that Jack has not defended her and stood up to his father, leaves him. Eighteen months later, unbeknownst to Jack, she has given birth to their son, Jackie, and is living alone to raise him. Unable to meet her bills and provide support she becomes a &quot;kept woman&quot; for her employer, Hector Ferguson (Purnell Pratt) an older, married man. He puts her up in a lavish apartment on Chicago&#x27;s Lakeshore Drive, providing her with clothing, jewels, servants and means. When Ferguson collapses, suddenly at his club, his wife (Mary Forbes) calls for Marion, telling her that he has asked for her at his deathbed. He dies leaving Marion a $500,000 inheritance and the press is quick to publicize their illicit relationship, casting doubts upon the paternity of Marion&#x27;s child.

Seeking protection for her son, she sends for Jack, now remarried to Catherine &quot;Flip&quot; Carson. (Kay Hammond) When Marion presents Jack with his son they rekindle their love for each other, Jack making plans to abandon his wife. However, Flip comes to visit Marion; having been injured in an automobile accident on a honeymoon trip to France, she requires a wheelchair and is unable to bear children. She declares that she is prepared to let Jack go, due to her disability and because she knows that he is still in love with Marion. Deeply moved by Flip&#x27;s sacrifice, and for the sake of her child, she sends Jackie to live with Jack and Flip. She sinks to the floor in despair as Jackie&#x27;s nanny, Mrs. Potter (Blanche Friderici) leads him away. She returns the $500,000 to Ferguson&#x27;s estate and relocates to New York. Some years later, Flip has died leaving Marion and Jack free to reunite.

==Production background==
&quot;The Trespasser&quot; was produced as both a silent and sound version for a total negative cost of $725,000. Gloria Swanson, in her sound film debut, received an Academy Award nomination. It was written and directed by Edmund Goulding and was first filmed as a silent film. A sound version was quickly made and was a big hit for its star, Gloria Swanson. Goulding remade the film as &quot;That Certain Woman&quot; (1937) with Bette Davis and Henry Fonda.

==Preservation status==
George Eastman House preserved the film with the help of the American Film Institute and The Film Foundation. This restored version was shown on Turner Classic Movies on December 14, 2011.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Trespasser&quot; proved to be one of Swanson&#x27;s only two hit sound films, the other being &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950) many years later. Subsequent films like &quot;What a Widow!&quot; (1930), &quot;Indiscreet&quot; (1931), &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; (1931), &quot;Perfect Understanding&quot; (1933), and &quot;Music in the Air&quot; (1934) were all box-office flops.

&quot;The Trespasser&quot; was an important film for Swanson, following the financially disastrous &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; (1929) and the hit &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; (1928). This was Swanson&#x27;s second Oscar nomination. Despite the disappointments following &quot;The Trespasser,&quot; Swanson was remembered by Billy Wilder, a screenwriter on &quot;Music in the Air&quot; (1934), when he was casting the part of Norma Desmond for &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950).
