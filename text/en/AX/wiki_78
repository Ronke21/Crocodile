<text>Subsidence is a general term for downward vertical movement of the Earth&#x27;s surface, which can be caused by both natural processes and human activities. Subsidence involves little or no horizontal movement, which distinguishes it from slope movement.

Processes that lead to subsidence include dissolution of underlying carbonate rock by groundwater; gradual compaction of sediments; withdrawal of fluid lava from beneath a solidified crust of rock; mining; pumping of subsurface fluids, such as groundwater or petroleum; or warping of the Earth&#x27;s crust by tectonic forces. Subsidence resulting from tectonic deformation of the crust is known as tectonic subsidence and can create accommodation for sediments to accumulate and eventually lithify into sedimentary rock.

Ground subsidence is of global concern to geologists, geotechnical engineers, surveyors, engineers, urban planners, landowners, and the public in general. Pumping of groundwater or petroleum has led to subsidence of as much as in many locations around the world and incurring costs measured in hundreds of millions of US dollars. Land subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal will likely increase in occurrence and related damages, primarily due to global population and economic growth, which will continue to drive higher groundwater demand.

== Causes ==

===Dissolution of limestone===
Subsidence frequently causes major problems in karst terrains, where dissolution of limestone by fluid flow in the subsurface creates voids (i.e., caves). If the roof of a void becomes too weak, it can collapse and the overlying rock and earth will fall into the space, causing subsidence at the surface. This type of subsidence can cause sinkholes which can be many hundreds of meters deep.

===Mining===
Several types of sub-surface mining, and specifically methods which intentionally cause the extracted void to collapse (such as pillar extraction, longwall mining and any metalliferous mining method which uses &quot;caving&quot; such as &quot;block caving&quot; or &quot;sub-level caving&quot;) will result in surface subsidence. Mining-induced subsidence is relatively predictable in its magnitude, manifestation and extent, except where a sudden pillar or near-surface tunnel collapse occurs (usually very old workings). Mining-induced subsidence is nearly always very localized to the surface above the mined area, plus a margin around the outside. The vertical magnitude of the subsidence itself typically does not cause problems, except in the case of drainage (including natural drainage)–rather, it is the associated surface compressive and tensile strains, curvature, tilts and horizontal displacement that are the cause of the worst damage to the natural environment, buildings and infrastructure.

Where mining activity is planned, mining-induced subsidence can be successfully managed if there is co-operation from all of the stakeholders. This is accomplished through a combination of careful mine planning, the taking of preventive measures, and the carrying out of repairs post-mining.

===Extraction of petroleum and natural gas===
If natural gas is extracted from a natural gas field the initial pressure (up to 60 MPa (600 bar)) in the field will drop over the years. The pressure helps support the soil layers above the field. If the gas is extracted, the overburden pressure sediment compacts and may lead to earthquakes and subsidence at the ground level.

Since exploitation of the Slochteren (Netherlands) gas field started in the late 1960s the ground level over a 250 km2 area has dropped by a current maximum of 30 cm.

Extraction of petroleum likewise can cause significant subsidence. The city of Long Beach, California, has experienced over the course of 34 years of petroleum extraction, resulting in damage of over $100 million to infrastructure in the area. The subsidence was brought to a halt when secondary recovery wells pumped enough water into the oil reservoir to stabilize it.

=== Earthquake ===
Land subsidence can occur in various ways during an earthquake. Large areas of land can subside drastically during an earthquake because of offset along fault lines. Land subsidence can also occur as a result of settling and compacting of unconsolidated sediment from the shaking of an earthquake.

The Geospatial Information Authority of Japan reported immediate subsidence caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. In Northern Japan, subsidence of 0.50 m (1.64 ft) was observed on the coast of the Pacific Ocean in Miyako, Tōhoku, while Rikuzentakata, Iwate measured 0.84 m (2.75 ft). In the south at Sōma, Fukushima, 0.29 m (0.95 ft) was observed. The maximum amount of subsidence was 1.2 m (3.93 ft), coupled with horizontal diastrophism of up to 5.3 m (17.3 ft) on the Oshika Peninsula in Miyagi Prefecture.

===Groundwater-related subsidence===

Groundwater-related subsidence is the subsidence (or the sinking) of land resulting from groundwater extraction. It is a growing problem in the developing world as cities increase in population and water use, without adequate pumping regulation and enforcement. One estimate has 80% of serious land subsidence problems associated with the excessive extraction of groundwater, making it a growing problem throughout the world.

Groundwater fluctuations can also indirectly affect the decay of organic material. The habitation of lowlands, such as coastal or delta plains, requires drainage. The resulting aeration of the soil leads to the oxidation of its organic components, such as peat, and this decomposition process may cause significant land subsidence. This applies especially when groundwater levels are periodically adapted to subsidence, in order to maintain desired unsaturated zone depths, exposing more and more peat to oxygen. In addition to this, drained soils consolidate as a result of increased effective stress. In this way, land subsidence has the potential of becoming self-perpetuating, having rates up to 5 cm/yr. Water management used to be tuned primarily to factors such as crop optimization but, to varying extents, avoiding subsidence has come to be taken into account as well.

===Faulting induced===
When differential stresses exist in the Earth, these can be accommodated either by geological faulting in the brittle crust, or by ductile flow in the hotter and more fluid mantle. Where faults occur, absolute subsidence may occur in the hanging wall of normal faults. In reverse, or thrust, faults, relative subsidence may be measured in the footwall.

===Isostatic subsidence===
The crust floats buoyantly in the asthenosphere, with a ratio of mass below the &quot;surface&quot; in proportion to its own density and the density of the asthenosphere. If mass is added to a local area of the crust (e.g., through deposition), the crust subsides to compensate and maintain isostatic balance.

The opposite of isostatic subsidence is known as isostatic rebound—the action of the crust returning (sometimes over periods of thousands of years) to a state of isostacy, such as after the melting of large ice sheets or the drying-up of large lakes after the last ice age. Lake Bonneville is a famous example of isostatic rebound. Due to the weight of the water once held in the lake, the earth&#x27;s crust subsided nearly to maintain equilibrium. When the lake dried up, the crust rebounded. Today at Lake Bonneville, the center of the former lake is about higher than the former lake edges.

===Seasonal effects===

Many soils contain significant proportions of clay. Because of the very small particle size, they are affected by changes in soil moisture content. Seasonal drying of the soil results in a lowering of both the volume and the surface of the soil. If building foundations are above the level reached by seasonal drying, they move, possibly resulting in damage to the building in the form of tapering cracks.

Trees and other vegetation can have a significant local effect on seasonal drying of soils. Over a number of years, a cumulative drying occurs as the tree grows. That can lead to the opposite of subsidence, known as heave or swelling of the soil, when the tree declines or is felled. As the cumulative moisture deficit is reversed, which can last up to 25 years, the surface level around the tree will rise and expand laterally. That often damages buildings unless the foundations have been strengthened or designed to cope with the effect.

=== Weight of buildings ===
High buildings can create land subsidence by pressing the soil beneath with their weight. The problem is already felt in New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Lagos.

== Impacts ==

=== Increase of flooding potential ===
Land subsidence leads to the lowering of the ground surface, altering the topography. This elevation reduction increases the risk of flooding, particularly in river flood plains and delta areas.

==== Sinking cities ====
===Earth fissures===
Earth fissures are linear fractures that appear on the land surface, characterized by openings or offsets. These fissures can be several meters deep, several meters wide, and extend for several kilometers. They form when the deformation of an aquifer, caused by pumping, concentrates stress in the sediment. This inhomogeneous deformation results in the differential compaction of the sediments. Ground fissures develop when this tensile stress exceeds the tensile strength of the sediment.

===Infrastructure damage===
Land subsidence can lead to differential settlements in buildings and other infrastructures, causing angular distortions. When these angular distortions exceed certain values, the structures can become damaged, resulting in issues such as tilting or cracking.

== Field measurement of subsidence ==
Land subsidence causes vertical displacements (subsidence or uplift). Although horizontal displacements also occur, they are generally less significant. The following are field methods used to measure vertical and horizontal displacements in subsiding areas:

* Surveying.
* Borehole extensometers.
* Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
* Interferometric Synthetic Apertura Radar (InSAR)
* LiDAR
* Tiltmeters.

Tomás et al. conducted a comparative analysis of various land subsidence monitoring techniques. The results indicated that InSAR offered the highest coverage, lowest annual cost per point of information and the highest point density. Additionally, they found that, aside from continuous acquisition systems typically installed in areas with rapid subsidence, InSAR had the highest measurement frequencies. In contrast, leveling, non-permanent GNSS, and non-permanent extensometers generally provided only one or two measurements per year.

== Land Subsidence Prediction ==

=== Empirical Methods ===
These methods project future land subsidence trends by extrapolating from existing data, treating subsidence as a function solely of time. The extrapolation can be performed either visually or by fitting appropriate curves. Common functions used for fitting include linear, bilinear, quadratic, and/or exponential models. For example, this method has been successfully applied for predicting mining-induced subsidence.

=== Semi-Empirical or Statistical Methods ===
These approaches evaluate land subsidence based on its relationship with one or more influencing factors, such as changes in groundwater levels, the volume of groundwater extraction, and clay content.

=== Theoretical Methods ===

==== 1D Model ====
This model assumes that changes in piezometric levels affecting aquifers and aquitards occur only in the vertical direction. It allows for subsidence calculations at a specific point using only vertical soil parameters.

==== Quasi-3D Model ====
Quasi-three-dimensional seepage models apply Terzaghi&#x27;s one-dimensional consolidation equation to estimate subsidence, integrating some aspects of three-dimensional effects.

==== 3D Model ====
The fully coupled three-dimensional model simulates water flow in three dimensions and calculates subsidence using Biot&#x27;s three-dimensional consolidation theory.

=== Machine learning ===
Machine learning has become a new approach for tackling nonlinear problems. It has emerged as a promising method for simulating and predicting land subsidence.

<doc id="183962" wikidata="Q469940" url="?curid=183962" title="Anhinga">
<text>The anhinga (; Anhinga anhinga), sometimes called snakebird, darter, American darter, or water turkey, is a water bird of the warmer parts of the Americas. The word &quot;anhinga&quot; comes from &quot;a&#x27;ñinga&quot; in the Brazilian Tupi language and means &quot;devil bird&quot; or &quot;snake bird&quot;. The origin of the name is apparent when swimming: only the neck appears above water, so the bird looks like a snake ready to strike. They do not have external nares (nostrils) and breathe solely through their epiglottis.

The anhinga is placed in the darter family, Anhingidae, and is closely related to Indian (&quot;Anhinga melanogaster&quot;), African (&quot;Anhinga rufa&quot;), and Australian (&quot;Anhinga novaehollandiae&quot;) darters. Like other darters, the anhinga hunts by spearing fish and other small prey using its sharp, slender beak.

==Distribution and migration==
Members of the &quot;Anhinga&quot; genus live in warm, shallow waters and swamplands worldwide. The American anhinga has been subdivided into two subspecies, &quot;A. a. anhinga&quot; and &quot;A. a. leucogaster&quot;, based on their respective location. &quot;A. a. anhinga&quot; can be found mainly east of the Andes in South America, east to the islands of Trinidad and Tobago. &quot;A. a. leucogaster&quot; can be found in the southern United States, Mexico, Cuba, and the Caribbean island of Grenada. A fossil species, &quot;Anhinga walterbolesi,&quot; has been described from the Late Oligocene to Early Miocene of Australia.

Only birds living in the extreme north or south of their respective ranges will migrate based on temperature and available sunlight; anhingas will travel closer towards the equator during winter, but this range is &quot;determined by the amount of sunshine to warm the chilled birds&quot;. Although not part of their traditional range, American anhingas have been found as far north as the states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and New York.

Kettles of anhingas often migrate with other species of birds, and have been described as resembling &quot;black paper gliders&quot;.

==Description==
The anhinga is a large bird, measuring approximately in length (with a range of ), with a wingspan. The &quot;A. a. anhinga&quot; subspecies is larger than &quot;A. a. leucogaster&quot; and has broader buffy tail tips. They weigh on average around , with a range of . The bill is relatively long (about twice the length of the head), sharply pointed, and yellow, and the webbed feet are yellow as well.

The male is glossy black-green with wings, a base of wings, and a glossy black-blue tail. The tip of the tail is white. The back of the head and the neck have elongated feathers that have been described as gray or light purple-white. The upper back of the body and wings are spotted or streaked with white.

The female anhinga is similar to the male except for its pale gray-buff or light brown head, neck, and upper chest. The lower chest or breast is a chestnut color, and the back is browner than the male&#x27;s.

The hatchling starts bald but gains tan down within a few days of hatching. Within two weeks, the tan down is replaced by white down. Three weeks after hatching, the first juvenile feathers appear. Juveniles are mostly brown until they first breed, usually after the second or third winter.

This bird is often mistaken for the double-crested cormorant due to its similar size and shape, although the two species can be differentiated by their tails and bills. The tail of the anhinga is wider and much longer than the cormorant&#x27;s. The bill of the anhinga is pointed, while the bill of the cormorant has a hook-tip.

Like other species in the genus, anhingas have a noticeable &quot;kink&quot; midway up their necks. This is due to the peculiar morphology of the eighth cervical vertebra.

==Behavior==
Anhingas swim underwater by kicking their webbed feet to pursue their prey, fish or amphibians, which they spear by rapidly outstretching their bent neck. They come up to the surface to consume and swallow prey. Unlike ducks, ospreys and pelicans, which coat their feathers with oils from the uropygial gland, the anhinga does not have this ability; anhingas lack waterproof feathers on their bodies, causing them to be saturated upon immersion into water, while the flight feathers are slightly less wettable. Thus, their habit of basking in the sun with outstretched wings is crucial. Their dense bones, wetted plumage, and neutral buoyancy in water allow them to fully submerge and hunt for underwater prey.

Anhingas cannot fly for any extended distance with soaked feathers; if they attempt to fly while wet, notable difficulty is experienced, the birds flapping vigorously while &quot;running&quot; on the water&#x27;s surface for a short distance (often escaping a perceived threat). Like cormorants, anhingas perch and rest on fallen trees, logs or rocks near the water&#x27;s edge with wings spread and feathers fanned-open in a semicircular shape, facing away from the sun, in order to dry themselves and absorb the sun&#x27;s heat. Anhingas also lose body heat relatively fast, and their posture helps them absorb solar radiation from the sun to counteract this. Because an anhinga in the drying position resembles a male turkey, it has been colloquially referred to as the &#x27;water turkey&#x27; or &#x27;swamp turkey&#x27;.

== Diet ==

Anhingas feed on moderately sized wetland fishes, amphibians, aquatic invertebrates and insects. In Alabama, the anhinga&#x27;s diet consists of fishes (such as mullet, sunfish, black bass, catfish, suckers, and chain pickerel), crayfish, crabs, shrimp, aquatic insects, tadpoles, water snakes and small terrapins. In Florida, sunfishes and bass, killifishes, and live-bearing fishes are primarily eaten by the anhingas. Other fish eaten include pupfish and percids.

Anhingas stalk fish underwater, mainly where there is some vegetation. Once they locate their prey, they partly open their bill and stab the fish swiftly. For larger fish, they use both their jaws; for small fish, they may use only the lower jaw. If the fish is too large to forage, the anhinga stabs it repeatedly and then lets it go. Anhingas bring their capture to the surface of the water, toss it backward and engulf it head-first.

==Conservation status==
The US protects the anhinga under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. The number of individual anhingas has not been estimated, but they are considered to be of least concern because of the frequency of their occurrence in their global range.

<text>William Henry Waddington (11 December 182613 January 1894) was a French who served as Prime Minister in 1879, and as an Ambassador of France to London.

==Early life and education==
Waddington was born at the Château of Saint-Rémy in Eure-et-Loir, the son of a rich British industrialist, Thomas Waddington, whose family had established a large cotton manufacturing business in France, Établissements Waddington fils et Cie.

His father and mother Anne (née Chisholm) were both naturalised French citizens, and Waddington received his early education at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He was then sent to Repton School and then Rugby School in Britain, supervised by his uncle Walter Shirley. After Rugby, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge; he took an MA degree, having won Second Prize in Classics as well as the prestigious Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal.

Waddington rowed in the victorious Cambridge eight in the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race on the Thames in race of March 1849; he did not take part in the repeat race in December that year, which Oxford won.

==Career==
=== Archaeological research ===
Returning to France, Waddington devoted himself for some years to archaeological research. He travelled throughout Asia Minor, Greece and Syria, and his experiences and discoveries are detailed in two &quot;Mémoires&quot;, the first produced by the French Institute and subsequently in his &quot;Mélanges de numismatique et de philologie&quot; (&quot;Numismatic and Philological Miscellanies&quot;, 1861).

Except for his essay on &quot;The Protestant Church in France&quot;, published in 1856 in &quot;Cambridge Essays&quot;, his remaining works all concerned archaeology. They include his &quot;Fastes des Provinces Asiatiques de l&#x27;Empire Romain&quot; (&quot;The Governor-Lists of the Asiatic Provinces of the Roman Empire&quot;, 1872), and editions of Diocletian&#x27;s &quot;Edict on Maximum Prices&quot; and of Philippe Le Bas&#x27; &quot;Voyage archéologique&quot; (1868–1877).

A Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, in 1865, Waddington was also elected a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.

===Chamber of Deputies===
After contesting the seat of the Aisne for the Chamber of Deputies unsuccessfully in 1865 and 1860, Waddington was elected as Deputy in January 1871. In 1873, he was appointed Minister of Public Instruction in Prime Minister Dufaure&#x27;s short-lived second government of 18–24 May 1873.

===Senator for the Aisne===

On 30 January 1876, he was elected Senator for Aisne and was again nominated by Prime Minister Dufaure to the ministerial brief of Public Instruction. He was charged with devising a Bill transferring extra powers to the State, a tricky task which he negotiated through the Chamber, but was defeated in the Senate. He continued to hold office under Jules Simon&#x27;s premiership until being thrown out during the &quot;Seize mai&quot; constitutional crisis (16 May 1877).

The triumph of the Republicans in the following October 1877 General Election returned Waddington to government as Minister of Foreign Affairs, again under Prime Minister Dufaure. He was one of the French plenipotentiaries at the Berlin Congress (1878). The cession of Cyprus to the United Kingdom was, at first, perceived by the French newspapers as a great blow to his diplomatic reputation, until it became clear that his discussions with Lord Salisbury had resulted in Britain&#x27;s agreement to allow France a free hand in Tunisia.
In 1885, he was re-elected for the senate. 

===Prime Minister of France===
Early in 1879 Waddington agreed to take over from Jules Dufaure as a caretaker Prime Minister with the agreement of Léon Gambetta. He kept peace between the radicals and the reactionaries till the delay of urgent reforms lost him the support of all parties. He stepped down on 27 December.

He refused the immediate offer of ambassadorship to London, preferring to take up the role in 1880 of rapporteur to the parliamentary committee for the &quot;Scrutin de liste&quot; (of elections); he delivered an adverse judgment.

===French Ambassador to London===
In 1883 Waddington accepted the appointment and dignity of &quot;Ambassadeur de France&quot; to London. He held this post for ten years until 1893, during which time his wife, Mary Alsop King, wrote some recollections of their diplomatic experiences – &quot;Letters of a Diplomat&#x27;s Wife, 1883–1900&quot; (New York, 1903), and &quot;Italian Letters of a Diplomat&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1904), which were published after her husband&#x27;s death.

==Personal life==
Waddington&#x27;s first wife, whom he married in 1850, was Mathilde (died 1852), daughter of the banker, ; they had a son Henri (1852–1939), a captain in the Chasseurs Alpins (French Army), who married Émilie de La Robertie.

In Paris in 1874, Waddington married his second wife, Mary Alsop King (died 1923), an American-born author from New York City, daughter of Congressman Charles King, 9th President of Columbia College (by his second wife, the travel writer, Henrietta Liston Low). They had one son, Francis Richard, who married (18 January 1903, Paris) Charlotte, daughter of Vice-Admiral Jean-Charles-Alexandre Sallandrouze de Lamornaix. Charlotte was the granddaughter of Charles Sallandrouze de Lamornaix.

<text>The lysocline is the depth in the ocean dependent upon the carbonate compensation depth (CCD), usually around 5 km, below which the rate of dissolution of calcite increases dramatically because of a pressure effect. While the lysocline is the upper bound of this transition zone of calcite saturation, the CCD is the lower bound of this zone.

CaCO3 content in sediment varies with different depths of the ocean, spanned by levels of separation known as the transition zone. In the mid-depth area of the ocean, sediments are rich in CaCO3, content values reaching 85–95%. This area is then spanned hundreds of meters by the transition zone, ending in the abyssal depths with 0% concentration. The lysocline is the upper bound of the transition zone, where amounts of CaCO3 content begins to noticeably drop from the mid-depth 85–95% sediment. The CaCO3 content drops to 0% concentration at the lower bound, known as the calcite compensation depth.

Shallow marine waters are generally supersaturated in calcite, CaCO3, because as marine organisms (which often have shells made of calcite or its polymorph, aragonite) die, they tend to fall downwards without dissolving. As depth and pressure increases within the water column, calcite solubility increases, causing supersaturated water above the saturation depth, allowing for preservation and burial of CaCO3 on the seafloor. However, this creates undersaturated seawater below the saturation depth, preventing CaCO3 burial on the sea floor as the shells start to dissolve.

The equation Ω = [Ca2+] X [CO32-]/K&#x27;sp expresses the CaCO3 saturation state of seawater. The calcite saturation horizon is where Ω =1; dissolution proceeds slowly below this depth. The lysocline is the depth that this dissolution impacts is again notable, also known as the inflection point with sedimentary CaCO3 versus various water depths.

== Calcite compensation depth ==
The calcite compensation depth (CCD) occurs at the depth that the rate of calcite to the sediments is balanced with the dissolution flux, the depth at which the CaCO3 content are values 2–10%. Hence, the lysocline and CCD are not equivalent. The lysocline and compensation depth occur at greater depths in the Atlantic (5000–6000 m) than in the Pacific (4000–5000 m), and at greater depths in equatorial regions than in polar regions.

The depth of the CCD varies as a function of the chemical composition of the seawater and its temperature. Specifically, it is the deep waters that are undersaturated with calcium carbonate primarily because its solubility increases strongly with increasing pressure and salinity and decreasing temperature. As the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide continues to increase, the CCD can be expected to decrease in depth, as the ocean&#x27;s acidity rises.

<text>Pierre Marie René Ernest Waldeck-Rousseau (; 2 December 184610 August 1904) was a French Republican politician who served for three years as the Prime Minister of France.

==Early life==

Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau was born in Nantes, Brittany. His father, René Waldeck-Rousseau, a barrister at the Nantes bar and a leader of the local republican party, figured in the revolution of 1848 as one of the deputies elected to the Constituent Assembly for Loire Inférieure.

The son was a delicate child whose eyesight made reading difficult, and his early education was therefore entirely oral. He studied law at Poitiers and in Paris, where he took his licentiate in January 1869. His father&#x27;s record ensured his reception in high republican circles. Jules Grévy stood sponsor for him at the Parisian bar. After six months of waiting for briefs in Paris, he decided to return home and to join the bar of St Nazaire early in 1870. In September he became, in spite of his youth, secretary to the municipal commission temporarily appointed to carry on the town business. He organized the National Defence at St Nazaire, and himself marched out with his contingent, though they saw no active service owing to lack of ammunition, their private store having been commandeered by the state.

== Under the Third Republic ==
In 1873, following the establishment of the Third Republic in 1871, he moved to the bar of Rennes, and six years later was returned to the Chamber of Deputies. In his electoral program he had stated that he was prepared to respect all liberties except those of conspiracy against the institutions of the country and of educating the young in hatred of the modern social order. In the Chamber he joined the Republican Union parliamentary group (&quot;Union républicaine&quot;) and supported the policy of Léon Gambetta.

The Waldeck-Rousseau family was strictly Catholic in spite of its republican principles; nevertheless, Waldeck-Rousseau supported the Jules Ferry laws on public, laic and mandatory education, enacted in 1881–1882. In 1881 he became minister of the interior in Gambetta&#x27;s grand ministry. He further voted for the abrogation of the law of 1814 forbidding work on Sundays and fast days, for one year of compulsory military service for seminarists and for the re-establishment of divorce. He made his reputation in the Chamber by a report which he drew up in 1880 on behalf of the committee appointed to inquire into the French judicial system.

===Capital/labour relations===
His main preoccupation was with the relations between capital and labour, and had a large share in securing the recognition of trade unions in 1884. He again became minister of the interior in the Jules Ferry cabinet of 1883–1885, when he showed considerable administrative ability. He sought to put down the system by which civil posts were obtained through the local deputy, and he made it clear that the central authority could not be defied by local officials. Waldeck-Rousseau also introduced the bill which became the 27 May 1885 act establishing penal colonies, dubbed &quot;Law on relegation of recidivists&quot;, along with Martin Feuillée. The law was supported by Gambetta and his friend, the criminologist Alexandre Lacassagne.

===Law practice===
Waldeck-Rousseau had begun to practise at the Paris bar in 1886, and in 1889 he did not seek re-election to the Chamber, but devoted himself to his legal work. The most famous of the many noteworthy cases in which his cold and penetrating intellect and his power of clear exposition were retained was the defense of Gustave Eiffel in the Panama scandals of 1893.

===Return to political life===
In 1894 he returned to political life as senator for the department of the Loire, and next year stood for the presidency of the republic against Félix Faure and Henri Brisson, being supported by the Conservatives, who were soon to be his bitter enemies. He received 184 votes, but retired before the second ballot to allow Faure to receive an absolute majority. During the political crisis of the next few years he was recognized by the Opportunist Republicans as the successor of Jules Ferry and Gambetta, and at the crisis of 1899 on the fall of the Charles Dupuy cabinet he was asked by President Émile Loubet to form a government.

===Coalition cabinet===
After an initial failure he succeeded in forming a coalition cabinet of &quot;Republican Defense&quot;, supported by the Radical-Socialists and the Socialists, which included such widely different politicians as the Socialist Alexandre Millerand and the General de Galliffet, dubbed the &quot;repressor of the Commune&quot;. He himself returned to his former post at the ministry of the interior, and set to work to quell the discontent with which the country was seething, to put an end to the various agitations which under specious pretences were directed against republican institutions (far-right leagues, Boulangist crisis, etc.), and to restore independence to the judicial authority. His appeal to all republicans to sink their differences before the common peril met with some degree of success, and enabled the government to allow the second court-martial of Alfred Dreyfus at Rennes a completely free hand, and then to find a compromise by negotiating a presidential pardon for Dreyfus. Waldeck-Rousseau achieved a considerable personal success in October by his successful intervention in the strikes at Le Creusot.

With the condemnation in January 1900 of Paul Deroulède and his nationalist followers by the High Court the worst of the danger was past, and Waldeck-Rousseau kept order in Paris without having recourse to irritating displays of force. The Senate was staunch in support of Waldeck-Rousseau, and in the Chamber he displayed remarkable astuteness in winning support from various groups. The Amnesty Bill, passed on 19 December, chiefly through his unwearied advocacy, went far to smooth down the acerbity of the preceding years. With the object of aiding the industry of wine-producing, and of discouraging the consumption of spirits and other deleterious liquors, the government passed a bill suppressing the octroi duties on the three &quot;hygienic&quot; drinks—wine, cider and beer. The act came into force at the beginning of 1901. A year earlier, in 1900, seats had been mandated for female clerks.

===Associations Bill of 1901===
The most important measure of Waldeck-Rousseau&#x27;s later administration was the Associations Bill of 1901. With his anti-clerical sentiment, he was convinced that the stability of the republic demanded restraining religious associations. All previous attempts in this direction had failed. In his speech in the Chamber, Waldeck-Rousseau recalled the fact that he had tried to pass an Associations Bill in 1882 and again in 1883. He declared that religious associations were now being subjected for the first time to the regulations common to all others and that the object of the bill was to ensure the supremacy of the civil power. Royalist sympathies given to the pupils in the religious seminaries was a principal cause of the passing of this bill, and the government took strong measures to secure the presence of officers of undoubted fidelity to the republic in the higher positions on the staff. His speeches on the religious question were published in 1901 under the title of &quot;Associations et congregations&quot;, following a volume of speeches on &quot;Questions sociales&quot; (1900).

All Conservative parties opposed Waldeck-Rousseau&#x27;s policies, especially the mass closure of church schools, as a persecution of religion. He led the anti-clerical coalition on the left, facing opposition primarily organized by the pro-Catholic Action libérale populaire, (ALP). The ALP had a stronger popular base, with better financing and a stronger network of newspapers, but had far fewer seats in parliament.

As the general election of 1902 approached, all sections of the Opposition united their efforts under the &quot;Bloc des gauches&quot;, and the name of Waldeck-Rousseau served as a battle-cry for one side, and on the other as a target for abuse. The result was a decisive victory for the left and Waldeck-Rousseau considered his task ended. Therefore, on 3 June 1902 he resigned office, having proved himself the &quot;strongest personality in French politics since the death of Gambetta.&quot;

He emerged from his retirement to protest in the Senate against the construction put on his Associations Bill by Émile Combes, who refused &quot;en masse&quot; the applications of the teaching and preaching congregations for official recognition.

==Death==
In January 1904, Waldeck-Rousseau announced that he was suffering from &quot;calculus of the liver&quot;. In May, he underwent surgery, — and, as was later revealed, attempted suicide. He died on August 11, 1904, after further surgery.

== Publication of speeches ==

His speeches were published as &quot;Discours parlementaires&quot; (1889); &quot;Pour la République, 1883–1903&quot; (1904), edited by H Leyret; &quot;L&#x27;État et la liberté&quot; (1906); and his &quot;Plaidoyers&quot; (1906) were edited by H Barboux. See also H Leyret, &quot;Waldeck-Rousseau et la Troisième République&quot; (1908).

<text>The ibis () (collective plural ibises; classical plurals ibides and ibes) are a group of long-legged wading birds in the family Threskiornithidae that inhabit wetlands, forests and plains. &quot;Ibis&quot; derives from the Latin and Ancient Greek word for this group of birds. It also occurs in the scientific name of the western cattle egret (&quot;Ardea ibis&quot;) mistakenly identified in 1757 as being the sacred ibis.

==Description==
Ibises all have long, downcurved bills, and usually feed as a group, probing mud for food items, usually crustaceans. They are monogamous and highly territorial while nesting and feeding. Most nest in trees, often with spoonbills or herons. All extant species are capable of flight, but two extinct genera were flightless, namely the kiwi-like &quot;Apteribis&quot; in the Hawaiian Islands, and the peculiar &quot;Xenicibis&quot; in Jamaica. The word &quot;ibis&quot; comes from Latin &quot;ibis&quot; from Greek ἶβις &quot;ibis&quot; from Egyptian &quot;hb&quot;, &quot;hīb&quot;.

==Species in taxonomic order==
There are 29 extant species and 4 extinct species of ibis.

An extinct species, the Jamaican ibis or clubbed-wing ibis (&quot;Xenicibis xympithecus&quot;) was uniquely characterized by its club-like wings. Extinct ibis species include the following:

* &quot;Geronticus perplexus&quot;. Discovered in France. It is known only from a piece of distal right humerus, found at Sansan France, in Middle Miocene rocks. It appears to represent an ancient member of the &quot;Geronticus&quot; lineage, in line with the theory that most living ibis genera seem to have evolved before 15 million years ago (mya).
* &quot;Geronticus apelex&quot;. Discovered in South Africa.
* &quot;Geronticus balcanicus&quot;. Discovered in Bulgaria.
* &quot;Theristicus wetmorei&quot;. Discovered in Peru.
* &quot;Eudodmus peruvianus&quot;. Discovered in Peru.
*&quot;Gerandibis pagana&quot;. Discovered in France. It is the sole species known for this genera.
*&quot;Aptertbis glenos&quot;. Discovered in Hawaii.
*&quot;Xenicibis xympithecus&quot;. Discovered in Jamaica.

== Ecology ==

=== Habitat ===
Most ibises are freshwater wetland birds using natural marshes, ponds, lakes, riversides for foraging. Some ibis species such as the white-faced ibis, and black-headed ibis benefit from flooded and irrigated agriculture. The Andean ibis is unusual in being found in high altitude grasslands of South America. The foraging and nesting behaviour, and fluctuating numbers of the white ibis matches closely with water levels in the Everglades ecosystem leading to its selection as a potential indicator species for the system. Few ibis species such as the olive ibis and green ibis are also found in dense forests. The Llanos grasslands of Venezuela have the highest global ibis diversity with seven species sharing the marshes and grasslands. Multiple ibis species manage to use the same area by exhibiting differences in the habitats used and the prey eaten. In Indian agricultural landscapes, three ibis species manage to live together by altering the habitats they use seasonally with the Black-headed Ibises and Glossy preferring shallow wetlands throughout the year, while the endemic Red-naped Ibises preferred upland areas thereby entirely avoiding potential competitive interactions. 

=== Breeding ===
Ibises breeding habits are very diverse. Many ibises such as the black-headed Ibis, scarlet ibis, glossy ibis, American white ibis and Australian white ibis breed in large colonies on trees. Nest trees are located either in large wetlands or in agricultural fields, with many species like the red-naped ibis breeding inside cities. The Australian white ibis also breeds extensively inside cities and has greatly expanded its population. The white-faced ibis sometimes nests on dry land and on low shrubs in marshes.

==In culture==
The African sacred ibis was an object of religious veneration in ancient Egypt, particularly associated with the deity Djehuty or otherwise commonly referred to in Greek as Thoth. He is responsible for writing, mathematics, measurement, and time as well as the moon and magic. In artworks of the Late Period of Ancient Egypt, Thoth is popularly depicted as an ibis-headed man in the act of writing. However, Mitogenomic diversity in sacred ibis mummies indicates that ancient Egyptians captured the birds from the wild rather than farming them.

At the town of Hermopolis, ibises were reared specifically for sacrificial purposes, and in the Ibis Galleries at Saqqara, archaeologists found the mummies of one and a half million ibises.

According to local legend in the Birecik area, the northern bald ibis was one of the first birds that Noah released from the Ark as a symbol of fertility, and a lingering religious sentiment in Turkey helped the colonies there to survive long after the demise of the species in Europe.

The mascot of the University of Miami is an American white ibis named Sebastian. The ibis was selected as the school mascot because of its legendary bravery during hurricanes. According to legend, the ibis is the last of wildlife to take shelter before a hurricane hits and the first to reappear once the storm has passed.
Harvard University&#x27;s humor magazine, &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;, uses the ibis as its symbol. A copper statue of an ibis is prominently displayed on the roof of the Harvard Lampoon Building at 44 Bow Street.

The short story &quot;The Scarlet Ibis&quot; by James Hurst uses the red bird as foreshadowing for a character&#x27;s death and as the primary symbol.

The African sacred ibis is the unit symbol of the Israeli Special Forces unit known as Unit 212 or Maglan (Hebrew מגלן).

According to Josephus, Moses used the ibis to help him defeat the Ethiopians.

The Australian white ibis has become a focus of art, pop culture, and memes since rapidly adapting to city life in recent decades, and has earned the popular nicknames &quot;bin chicken&quot; and &quot;tip turkey&quot;. In December 2017, the ibis placed second in &quot;Guardian Australia&quot; inaugural Bird of the Year poll, after leading for much of the voting period.

In April 2022, Queensland sports minister Stirling Hinchliffe suggested the ibis as a potential mascot for the 2032 Olympic Games, which are scheduled to be held in Brisbane. Hinchcliffe&#x27;s suggestion prompted much discussion in the media.

<doc id="183970" wikidata="Q23775" url="?curid=183970" title="Aragonite">
<text>Aragonite is a carbonate mineral and one of the three most common naturally occurring crystal forms of calcium carbonate (), the others being calcite and vaterite. It is formed by biological and physical processes, including precipitation from marine and freshwater environments.

The crystal lattice of aragonite differs from that of calcite, resulting in a different crystal shape, an orthorhombic crystal system with acicular crystal. Repeated twinning results in pseudo-hexagonal forms. Aragonite may be columnar or fibrous, occasionally in branching helictitic forms called &quot;flos-ferri&quot; (&quot;flowers of iron&quot;) from their association with the ores at the Carinthian iron mines.

==Occurrence==

The type location for aragonite is Molina de Aragón in the Province of Guadalajara in Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, for which it was named in 1797. Aragonite is found in this locality as cyclic twins inside gypsum and marls of the Keuper facies of the Triassic. This type of aragonite deposit is very common in Spain, and there are also some in France.

An aragonite cave, the Ochtinská Aragonite Cave, is situated in Slovakia.

In the US, aragonite in the form of stalactites and &quot;cave flowers&quot; (anthodite) is known from Carlsbad Caverns and other caves. For a few years in the early 1900s, aragonite was mined at Aragonite, Utah (now a ghost town).

Massive deposits of oolitic aragonite sand are found on the seabed in the Bahamas.

Aragonite is the high pressure polymorph of calcium carbonate. As such, it occurs in high pressure metamorphic rocks such as those formed at subduction zones.

Aragonite forms naturally in almost all mollusk shells, and as the calcareous endoskeleton of warm- and cold-water corals (Scleractinia). Several serpulids have aragonitic tubes. Because the mineral deposition in mollusk shells is strongly biologically controlled, some crystal forms are distinctively different from those of inorganic aragonite. In some mollusks, the entire shell is aragonite; in others, aragonite forms only discrete parts of a bimineralic shell (aragonite plus calcite). The nacreous layer of the aragonite fossil shells of some extinct ammonites forms an iridescent material called ammolite.

Aragonite also forms naturally in the endocarp of &quot;Celtis occidentalis&quot;.

The skeleton of some calcareous sponges is made of aragonite.

Aragonite also forms in the ocean inorganic precipitates called marine cements (in the sediment) or as free crystals (in the water column).
Inorganic precipitation of aragonite in caves can occur in the form of speleothems. Aragonite is common in serpentinites where magnesium-rich pore solutions apparently inhibit calcite growth and promote aragonite precipitation.

Aragonite is metastable at the low pressures near the Earth&#x27;s surface and is thus commonly replaced by calcite in fossils. Aragonite older than the Carboniferous is essentially unknown.

Aragonite can be synthesized by adding a calcium chloride solution to a sodium carbonate solution at temperatures above or in water-ethanol mixtures at ambient temperatures.

==Physical properties==
Aragonite is a thermodynamically unstable phase of calcium carbonate at any pressure below about at any temperature. Aragonite nonetheless frequently forms in near-surface environments at ambient temperatures. The weak Van der Waals forces inside aragonite give an important contribution to both the crystallographic and elastic properties of this mineral. The difference in stability between aragonite and calcite, as measured by the Gibbs free energy of formation, is small, and effects of grain size and impurities can be important. The formation of aragonite at temperatures and pressures where calcite should be the stable polymorph may be an example of Ostwald&#x27;s step rule, where a less stable phase is the first to form. The presence of magnesium ions may inhibit calcite formation in favor of aragonite. Once formed, aragonite tends to alter to calcite on scales of 107 to 108 years.

The mineral vaterite, also known as μ-CaCO3, is another phase of calcium carbonate that is metastable at ambient conditions typical of Earth&#x27;s surface, and decomposes even more readily than aragonite.

== Uses ==
In aquaria, aragonite is considered essential for the replication of reef conditions. Aragonite provides the materials necessary for much sea life and also keeps the pH of the water close to its natural level, to prevent the dissolution of biogenic calcium carbonate.

Aragonite has been successfully tested for the removal of pollutants like zinc, cobalt and lead from contaminated wastewaters.

<text>Corymbia, commonly known as bloodwoods, is a genus of about one hundred species of tree that, along with &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, &quot;Angophora&quot; and several smaller groups, are referred to as eucalypts. Until 1990, corymbias were included in the genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; and there is still considerable disagreement among botanists as to whether separating them is valid. As of January 2020, &quot;Corymbia&quot; is an accepted name at the Australian Plant Census.

==Description==
Eucalypts in the genus &quot;Corymbia&quot; are trees, sometimes mallee-like, that either have rough, fibrous or flaky bark, or smooth bark that is shed in small flakes or short strips. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that differ from adult leaves. The adult leaves are arranged alternately (strictly disjunct opposite, but appearing alternate), with oil glands. The flower buds are arranged in groups on a branching peduncle, each branch usually with seven buds, but with the pedicels of differing lengths, so that the inflorescence is flat-topped or convex. The anthers are joined to the filament at their mid-point and open by parallel slits. As in &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, the five sepals are fused to form an outer calyptra (or operculum) and the five petals an inner calyptra, the two calyptra being shed separately or together as the flower opens. Also as in &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; the fruit is usually a woody capsule, but in this case the disc is always depressed and the valves are always enclosed.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus &quot;Corymbia&quot; was first formally described in 1995 by Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson in the journal &quot;Telopea&quot;. The type species is &quot;C. gummifera&quot;. The genus name, &quot;Corymbia&quot; is from the Latin word &quot;corymbus&quot;, meaning &quot;a corymb&quot;.

The bloodwoods had been recognised as a distinct group within the large and diverse genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; since 1867. Molecular research in the 1990s, however, showed that they, along with the rest of the section Corymbia, are more closely related to &quot;Angophora&quot; than to &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, and are now regarded as a separate genus by the Australian Plant Census. All three genera, &quot;Angophora&quot;, &quot;Corymbia&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, are closely related, and are generally referred to as &quot;eucalypts&quot;.

Botanists Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson were the first to define the genus &quot;Corymbia&quot; in 1995, identifying the bloodwoods, ghost gums and spotted gums as a group distinct from &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;.

Since 1995, there have been ongoing investigations into the relationships between the genera. Genetic analysis of ETS and ITS sequences of DNA in 2006 by Carlos Parra-O and colleagues of 67 taxa (47 of which were within &quot;Corymbia&quot;) yielded &quot;Corymbia&quot; and &quot;Angophora&quot; as each other&#x27;s closest relatives, with the genus &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; as an earlier offshoot. The small genera &quot;Eucalyptopsis&quot;, &quot;Stockwellia&quot; and &quot;Allosyncarpia&quot; formed a clade which arose earlier still. In 2009, Parra-O and colleagues added more taxa and published a combined analysis of nuclear rDNA (ETS + ITS) and morphological characters published to clarify relationships within the genus. This confirmed two main clades, which they defined as the subgenera &quot;Corymbia&quot; and &quot;Blakella&quot;.

==Species list==
==Distribution==
Species of &quot;Corymbia&quot; occur in all mainland states of Australia and in the Northern Territory. There are about 100 species, all endemic to Australia except for four species that also occur in New Guinea, and one that is endemic to that country.

<doc id="183973" wikidata="Q5148422" url="?curid=183973" title="Colonial militia in Canada">
<text>The colonial militias in Canada were made up of various militias prior to Confederation in 1867. During the period of New France and Acadia, Newfoundland Colony, and Nova Scotia (1605–1763), these militias were made up of Canadiens (French Canadians), First Nations, British and Acadians. Traditionally, the Canadian Militia was the name used for the local sedentary militia regiments throughout the Canadas.

However, the term &quot;militia&quot; was also used to refer to the Canadian regular professional land forces, beginning with the passing of the Militia Act of 1855. Passed by the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, the act created the Active Militia, later referred to as the Permanent Active Militia. After PAM&#x27;s formation, the remaining sedentary colonial militia regiments were collectively referred to as the Non-Permanent Active Militia (NPAM). The terms PAM and NPAM continued to be used in Canada until 1940, when the Canadian militias was reorganized into the Canadian Army. The term Militia is still used to refer to the Canadian Army&#x27;s part-time Primary Reserve.

==History ==
===French colonial militia===


Military service has been part of Canadian life since the 17th century in New France, where colonists were required to serve in local militia to support regular units of the French army and navy. In 1651, Pierre Boucher received a commission of captain from the governor of New France and asked to raise militia corps in Trois-Rivières. Until the arrival of the Carignan-Salières Regiment in 1665, militia corps were the only defence of New France. In the long struggle between the French and British colonies, they were organized into companies, usually one per church parish, and structured in the same way as a regular French infantry company. The Governor General, Louis de Buade de Frontenac, arranged during the 1690s to provide all militiamen with clothing and equipment. This consisted generally of a capote, a breechcloth, leggings, a blanket, moccasins, a knife and two shirts, The clothing did not constitute a military uniform but was simply Canadian-style civilian wear. Since these men were not paid, this was a relatively economical way of maintaining an effective militia. British and colonial American troops found that the Indigenous-style tactics (i.e., guerrilla warfare, scalping) of the Canadian militia made them a formidable adversary. Perhaps the two most famous Canadian attacks against New England were the Siege of Pemaquid (1696) and the Raid on Deerfield (1704).

The success of the Canadians was underscored during the French and Indian War by George Washington&#x27;s defeat at Great Meadows and Edward Braddock&#x27;s embarrassment at the Monongahela River. The British response was to create new &quot;ranger&quot; and &quot;light infantry&quot; units adept at woodland warfare. When France ceded Canada to Great Britain in 1763, defence of the territory remained a duty shared by Canadian and British colonists, Indian nations, and the regular forces of Britain. As the colonies advanced to nationhood, its people were called to their own defence three times in the next 100 years.

Approximate numbers of militiamen in New France in 1759:

*Acadian Militia – 150 militiamen
* Canadien Cavalry: 200 cavalrymen
* District of Quebec: 5,640 militiamen
* District of Montreal: 5,455 militiamen 4,200 sent to Quebec City
* District of Trois-Rivière: 1,300 militiamen 1,100 to Quebec City
*First Nations: 1,800
====Acadia====
Until the establishment of Halifax (1749), the militia units in Acadia (present day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) were primarily Mi&#x27;kmaq, Maliseet and Acadian militia. Before the British Conquest of Acadia in 1710, these militias fought the New Englanders in King William&#x27;s War and Queen Anne&#x27;s War. After the conquest, the Mi&#x27;kmaq, Acadian and Maliseet militias continued to fight the British through Father Rale&#x27;s War, King George&#x27;s War, and Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War. The two latter wars saw the arrival Gorham&#x27;s Rangers, the first British militias established in the colony (the British regulars of the 40th Regiment of Foot was raised in the colony 1720). The Mi&#x27;kmaq and Acadian militias continued to fight in Nova Scotia throughout the French and Indian War.

===British colonial militia===
====American Revolutionary War====
In 1775, during the American Revolutionary War, plans to invade Canada were drawn up as the first major military initiative by the newly formed Continental Army. The objective of the campaign was to gain military control of the British Province of Quebec (modern day Canada), and convince the French-speaking Canadiens to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies. There were only two British regiments in the colony of Quebec. Companies of Canadian volunteers had to be raised to support the regular troops. Pro-American sympathies were a problem among the anglophone company raised by the Montreal merchants. In November 1775, Governor Carleton organized the defenders of Quebec City to face a siege by the American rebels. British regular troops were few in number. Canadian militia, from both the anglophone and francophone communities, made up the majority of the defenders. The militia of Quebec City was divided into two sections in 1775—&#x27;Canadian Militia&#x27; drawn from the francophone population, and &#x27;British Militia&#x27; made up of anglophones. During the siege of Quebec, both were issued with the same uniform: green coat without lapels, with green facings; buff waistcoats and breeches; tricorne hat. The uniforms were drawn from stocks sent from Britain in the summer of 1775 for a proposed but never raised corps of Canadian light infantry.

In the aftermath of the American Revolutionary came an exodus of 40,000 Loyalists into the Canadas, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, joined by many of the Six Nations Iroquois who had remained loyal to the United Kingdom. Since many of the new Canadians were also veterans of Loyalist regiments, they brought both the British sympathies and the military training to establish competent professional forces to oppose the perceived American threat. Called &quot;fencibles&quot;, the new units were organized within the British army, but charged wholly with the defence of their home colonies. Their professional presence also enhanced training for the citizen militia and established many traditions that continue to modern times.

====War of 1812====
In 1812, with the United Kingdom engaged in Europe, the United States took the opportunity to declare war and launch another attempt to capture Canada and expand westward into Indian territories. While British redcoats did most of the fighting in the War of 1812, Canadian militia and allied Indian warriors proved to be a vital part of Canada&#x27;s defence.

The merit of British professional commanders was illustrated by Major-General Sir Isaac Brock in Upper Canada (Ontario) and Lieutenant-Colonel Charles de Salaberry, a French Canadian, in Lower Canada (Quebec). As soon as war was declared, Brock hastened to capture the American post on Lake Huron at Michilimackinac. Besides closing a key crossing on the Great Lakes, his success earned the admiration and loyalty of the Indian leader, Tecumseh. Brock then led a force of his troops along with colonial militia, fencibles and Tecumseh&#x27;s Indians to capture Fort Detroit, securing the upper Great Lakes.

In the east, the French Canadians fought a crucial battle at Châteauguay, south of Montreal. With only a force of Canadian regulars and militia supported by allied Indians, de Salaberry turned back a larger column of Americans advancing on Montreal.

Brock died a Canadian hero as he repelled the American landing at the Battle of Queenston Heights and Tecumseh was later killed at the Battle of the Thames. Many engagements proved to be bloody but indecisive, including the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane near Niagara Falls, Ontario, the burning of both York (Toronto) and Washington, and in numerous naval engagements on the Great Lakes. When the war concluded in 1815, nothing material had changed for the European powers. The Treaty of Ghent restored all pre-war boundaries. Canadians, meanwhile, discovered the seeds of nationhood in their victories and their sacrifices, while their allies, the Indian nations, saw their hopes for secure boundaries of their own vanish.

====Rebellions of 1837–1838====
The militia were actively engaged in the Rebellions of 1837–1838, as well as the aftermath of the Patriot War, which involved American groups invading the Canadas, such as the Battle of the Windmill.

====Fenian Raids====

In 1855, the Parliament of the Province of Canada passed the Militia Act, which authorized the raising of an initial force of 5,000 (later increased to 10,000) regulars. The act was passed to raise an active force of militia which could partially compensate for the withdrawal of British regulars as a result of the Crimean War. Although additional British troops were re-deployed to Canada to deter a potential Union invasion during the American Civil War, this force played an instrumental role in the defence of Canada from that point forward.

Founded in the mid 19th-century, the Fenian Brotherhood was an association of Irish-American veterans of the American Civil War who plotted to gain Ireland independence from British rule by attacking Britain&#x27;s overseas colonies within striking distance. In response, 20,000 Canadians volunteered for militia service, many from the Orange Order. Several hundred soldiers were quickly deployed from nearby Toronto, many of them coming from The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada. In Hamilton, the 13th Battalion (today&#x27;s Royal Hamilton Light Infantry) mobilized over two hundred soldiers for frontier service.

The first serious raid came in June 1866 with 850 Fenians attacking at Ridgeway in the Niagara region, then withdrawing quickly back across the border. This was the largest and best-organized raid, and militia units, again primarily the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles and Hamilton&#x27;s 13th Battalion, were called out. The engagement ended with Fenian victory at Ridgeway, but the Fenians withdrew back to the United States through Fort Erie, where another skirmish was fought before the invaders withdrew across the Niagara River. Militia units skirmished with the Fenians sporadically until 1871. The raids ended after unsuccessful attacks during the Battle of Eccles Hill in Quebec and in the northwest frontier, near the Manitoba border. The Fenians accomplished little, but the Canadian colonies came to recognize a shared need for a vigilant and coordinated defence: a key factor leading to a confederation of the provinces into one country in 1867.

==Equipment==
==Forts==

Forts were utilized by both French and British militia units throughout Canada&#x27;s colonial history. The following forts built by the authorities of New France were used by its military, including its militia units:

Military fortifications continued to be used by the British after the conquest of 1760. In addition to using the forts already built by the previous French regime, the British Army, and Canadian militia units, also built their own fortifications. The following British-built fortifications were used by members of the Canadian militia:

<doc id="183974" wikidata="Q274540" url="?curid=183974" title="Alexandre Millerand">
<text>Alexandre Millerand (; – ) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1920 to 1924, having previously served as Prime Minister of France earlier in 1920. His participation in Waldeck-Rousseau&#x27;s cabinet at the start of the 20th century, alongside the Marquis de Galliffet, who had directed the repression of the 1871 Paris Commune, sparked a debate in the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) and in the Second International about the participation of socialists in bourgeois governments.

In 1912 Millerand was appointed as war minister in Poincaré&#x27;s cabinet. He returned to the same post during the first year of World War I, helping set French war strategy. After Clemenceau&#x27;s defeat in 1920, Millerand formed a cabinet and held both the premiership and the ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1920-1924 he served as president of France. He faced criticism for openly supporting conservative candidates in the 1924 elections and the left majority forced his resignation. Thereafter he played only a minor role in politics.

==Biography==
=== Early life and religion ===
Millerand was brought up in Paris, to Jean-François Millerand and Amélie-Mélanie Cahen of Alsatian Jewish origin, while his paternal family originated from Franche-Comté.

Millerand was baptized in 1860, while his mother converted to Catholicism. However, Millerand later became an agnostic, even going as far as to participate in a civil marriage ceremony. None of his children were baptized either.

===Early activism===
Born in Paris, he was educated for the bar and was elected Secrétaire of the Conférence des avocats du barreau de Paris. He made his reputation through his defence, in company with Georges Laguerre, of Ernest Roche and Duc-Quercy, the instigators of the strike at Decazeville in 1883. He then took Laguerre&#x27;s place on Georges Clemenceau&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;La Justice&quot;. He was a freemason between 1883 and 1905.

He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the Seine &quot;département&quot; in 1885 as a Radical Socialist. He was associated with Clemenceau and Camille Pelletan as an arbitrator in the Carmaux strike (1892). He had long had the ear of the Chamber in matters of social legislation, and after the Panama scandals had discredited so many politicians, his influence grew.

He was chief of the Independent Socialist faction, a group which then mustered sixty members. Until 1896, he edited their organ in the press, &quot;La Petite République&quot;. His programme included the collective ownership of the means of production and the international association of labour.

===Government minister===

In June 1899 he entered Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau&#x27;s cabinet of &quot;republican defence&quot; as Minister of Commerce. In contrast to his earlier activism, he now limited himself to practical reforms, devoting his attention to the improvement of the merchant marine, to the development of trade, of technical education, of the postal system, and to the amelioration of the conditions of labour. Labour questions were entrusted to a separate department, the &quot;Direction du Travail&quot;, and the pension and insurance office was also raised to the status of a &quot;direction&quot;.

In 1902, he did not join fellow independent socialist Jean Jaurès in forming the Parti Socialiste Français, but in 1907 instead formed the small Independent Socialist Party, which became the Republican-Socialist Party (PRS) in 1911. His influence with the far-left had already declined, for it was said that his departure from the true Marxist tradition had disintegrated the movement.

In 1909/1910, he served as Minister of Public Works, Posts and Telegraphs.

As labour minister, he was responsible for the introduction of a wide range of reforms, including the reduction in the maximum workday from 11 to 10 hours in 1904, the introduction of an 8-hour workday for postal employees, the prescribing of maximum hours and minimum wages for all work undertaken by public authorities, the bringing of workers&#x27; representatives into the Conseil supérieur de travail, the establishment of arbitration tribunals and inspectors of labour, and the creation of a labour section inside his Ministry of Commerce to tackle the problem of social insurance.

The introduction of trade union representatives on the &quot;Supreme Labour Council&quot;, the organisation of local labour councils, and instructions to factory inspectors to put themselves in communication with the councils of the trade unions were valuable concessions to labour. He further secured the rigorous application of earlier laws devised for the protection of the working class. His name was especially associated with a project for the establishment of old age pensions, which became law in 1905. In 1898, he became editor of &quot;La Lanterne&quot;.

Millerand twice served as Minister of War, first from 1912 to 1913 and again, during the early stages of World War I, from 1914 to 1915.

===Prime minister===

Millerand continued to move to the right, being appointed Prime Minister by the conservative President, Paul Deschanel. During his time as Prime Minister, a decree of February 1920 introduced the eight-hour day for seamen.

===Presidency and later years===
When Deschanel had to resign later in 1920 due to his mental disorder, Millerand emerged as a compromise candidate for President between the &quot;Bloc National&quot; and the remnants of the &quot;Bloc des gauches&quot;. Millerand appointed Georges Leygues, a politician with a long career of ministerial office, as Prime Minister and attempted to strengthen the executive powers of the Presidency. This move was resisted in the Chamber of Deputies and the French Senate, and Millerand was forced to appoint a stronger figure, Aristide Briand. Briand&#x27;s appointment was welcomed by both left and right, although the Socialists and the left wing of the Radical Party did not join his government.

However, Millerand dismissed Briand after just a year, and appointed the conservative republican Raymond Poincaré.

Millerand was accused of favouring conservatives in spite of the traditional neutrality of French Presidents and the composition of the legislature. On 14 July 1922, Millerand escaped an assassination attempt by Gustave Bouvet, a young French anarchist. Two years later, on 11 June 1924, Millerand resigned in the face of growing conflict between the elected legislature and the office of the President, following the victory of the &quot;Cartel des Gauches&quot;. Gaston Doumergue, who was the president of the Senate at the time, was chosen on 13 June to replace Millerand.
Millerand died in 1943 at Versailles, and was interred in the Passy Cemetery. He was awarded Serbian Order of Karađorđe&#x27;s Star.

<text>Below is a list of towns and cities in Switzerland. Until 2014 municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants were considered to be towns (, , ). Since 2014, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) uses a new algorithm (called , or ) to define whether a municipality can be called a town or not; it now also depends on its character. Currently, FSO considers 162 municipalities as towns/cities (, ) in Switzerland. Further, some municipalities which would fulfill such a definition nevertheless prefer to understand themselves still as a village, or consequently refer to themselves just as municipalities (, , ). The Swiss definition of a town differs from the definition of a municipality.

==List of towns and cities ==
This is an alphabetical list of towns or cities (these English terms can be used interchangeably, as there is no official differentiation), which follows the FSO&#x27;s definition (, ), as well as places with historic town rights (h) and/or market towns (m).

*Places in bold print are towns because of the FSO&#x27;s definition &quot;and&quot; historic town/market rights.
*Places in &quot;italics&quot; are towns excluded by the FSO&#x27;s definition, but places which have either historic town rights (h) or historic market rights (m). 
*Places in normal print are towns according to the FSO&#x27;s definition.
*Places that had lost historic town rights previously are identified with &quot;-h&quot;.
*Cantonal capitals (, , ) are underlined.

<doc id="183981" wikidata="Q208134" url="?curid=183981" title="Madura">
<text>Madura, is an Indonesian island off the northeastern coast of Java. The island comprises an area of approximately (administratively including various smaller islands to the east, southeast and north that are administratively part of Madura&#x27;s easternmost Sumenep Regency). Administratively, Madura is part of the province of East Java. It is separated from Java by the narrow Madura Strait. The administered area had a density of 755.6 people per km2 (1,957 per sq. mile) in mid-2023, while the main island had a somewhat higher figure of 840 per km2 (2,175.5 per sq. mile).

==Etymology ==

Madura is named for Madurai, the home of the Hindu deity Azhagar.

==History==

In 1624, Sultan Agung of Mataram conquered Madura, and the island&#x27;s government was brought under the Cakraningrats, a single princely line. The Cakraningrat family opposed Central Javanese rule and often conquered large parts of Mataram.

Following the First Javanese War of Succession between Amangkurat III and his uncle, Pangeran Puger, the Dutch gained control of the eastern half of Madura in 1705. Dutch recognition of Puger was influenced by the lord of West Madura, Cakraningrat II who is thought to have supported Puger&#x27;s claims in the hope that a new war in central Java would provide the Madurese with a chance to interfere. However, while Amangkurat was arrested and exiled to Ceylon, Puger took the title of Pakubuwono I and signed a treaty with the Dutch that granted them, East Madura.

The Cakraningrats agreed to help the Dutch quash the 1740 rebellion in Central Java after the Chinese massacre in 1740. In a 1743 treaty with the Dutch, Pakubuwono I ceded the full sovereignty of Madura to the Dutch, which was contested by Cakraningrat IV. Cakraningrat fled to Banjarmasin, took refuge with the British, was robbed and betrayed by the sultan, and captured by the Dutch and exiled to the Cape of Good Hope.

The Dutch continued Madura&#x27;s administrative divisions of four states each with their own regent. The island was initially important as a source of colonial troops and in the second half of the nineteenth century it became the main source of salt for Dutch-controlled territories in the archipelago. The Dutch gradually sidelined the Sultan and took over direct control of the entire island in the 1880s, governing it as the Madoera Residency. From 1948 to 1950, under the United States of Indonesia, Madura was administered as a federative state known as the State of Madura.

Madura Island is a relatively flat topography and there is no significant difference in elevation, which makes Madura a badland. Geologically, Madura is part of the northern limestone mountains of Java. The limestone hills in Madura are lower, rougher, and rounder than the hills in northern Java.

==Demography==

Madura (including its offshore islands) has a population of about four million, most of whom are ethnically Madurese. The main language of Madura is Madurese, one of a family of Austronesian languages, which is also spoken in part of eastern Java and on many of the 66 outlying islands.

The Madurese are a large ethnic population in Indonesia, numbering around 7 million inhabitants. They come from the island of Madura as well as surrounding islands, such as Gili Raja, Sapudi, Raas, and the Kangean Islands. In addition, many Madurese live in the eastern part of East Java, commonly called the &quot;Horseshoe&quot;, from Pasuruan to the north of Banyuwangi. Madurese are found in Situbondo and Bondowoso, and east of Probolinggo, Jember, and a few at most who speak Javanese, including North Surabaya, as well as some of Malang.

Madura has a Sunni Muslim majority and a large Shia minority. However, since 2012, interfaith discord has escalated violent, resulting in attacks on many Shia villages around the city of Sampang being attacked and the residents&#x27; escape for government refugee centers. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has provided details of such attacks in 2013.

== Administrative divisions ==
Madura Island is part of East Java province and is divided into the following four regencies, listed from west to east:

Note: Sumenep Regency, besides including the eastern quarter of Madura Island, also includes many offshore islands - notably the Kangean Islands to the east of Madura, the smaller Sapudi Islands lying between Madura and the Kangean Islands, and Talango Island closer to Madura; it also includes the small Masalembu Islands to the north (between Madura and Kalimantan) and the Giligenteng Islands to the southeast of Madura. The mainland (i.e. the area on Madura Island itself) covers 1,156.07 km2 (with 808,553 inhabitants in mid 2023) consisting of 18 districts, while the various islands are 937.40 km2 in area (with 333,657 people in mid 2023), comprising 9 districts, with 128 islands, 46 inhabited. 
 
==Economy==
On the whole, Madura is one of the poorest regions of the East Java province. Unlike Java, the soil is not fertile enough to make it a major agricultural producer. Limited economic opportunities have led to chronic unemployment and poverty. These factors have led to long-term emigration from the island, such that most ethnically Madurese people do not now live on Madura. People from Madura were some of the most numerous participants in government transmigration programs, moving to other parts of Indonesia.

Subsistence agriculture is a mainstay of the economy. Maize is a key subsistence crop, on the island&#x27;s many small landholdings. Cattle-raising is also a critical part of the agricultural economy, providing extra income to peasant farmer families, in addition to being the basis for Madura&#x27;s famous bull-racing competitions. Small-scale fishing is also important to the subsistence economy.

Among export industries, tobacco farming is a major contributor to the island&#x27;s economy. Madura&#x27;s soil, while unable to support many food crops, helps make the island an important producer of tobacco and cloves for the domestic &quot;kretek&quot; (clove cigarette) industry. Since the Dutch era, the island has also been a major producer and exporter of salt.

Bangkalan, on the western end of the island, has industrialized substantially since the 1980s. This region is within a short ferry ride of Surabaya, Indonesia&#x27;s second-largest city, and hence has gained a role as a suburb for commuters to Surabaya, and as a location for industry and services that need to be near the city.

The Surabaya-Madura (Suramadu) Bridge, opened in 2009, is expected to further increase the Bangkalan area&#x27;s interaction with the regional economy.

===Climate===
Almost all parts of Madura are lowlands and closer to equator, which make the island is warmer and drier than the mainland of East Java.
According to Köppen-Geiger climate classification, the climate of coastal Madura is tropical savannah (&quot;Aw&quot;).

According to Köppen-Geiger climate classification, the climate of inland Madura is tropical savannah (&quot;Aw&quot;).

==Culture==
===Bull racing===

Madura is famous for its bull-racing competition (called &quot;karapan sapi&quot;), where a jockey, usually a young boy, rides a simple wooden sled pulled by a pair of bulls over a course of about 100 meters in ten to fifteen seconds.

===Music and theatre===
Several forms of music and theatre are popular on Madura, particularly among lower-class people for whom they provide an inexpensive form of entertainment and community-building. The &quot;topeng&quot; theatre, which involves masked performances of classic stories such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata, is the Madurese performance artist best known outside the island, due to its role as a representative Madurese art form at exhibitions of regional cultures from all over Indonesia. However, performances of it are rare on Madura and are generally restricted to entertainment at large official functions. The less formal &quot;loddrok&quot; theatre, where performers do not wear masks and perform a wider range of themes, is more popular on the island.

The gamelan orchestra, best known as a classical Javanese instrument, is also played on Madura, where several of the former royal courts, such as at Bangkalan and Sumenep, possess elaborate gamelans. &quot;Tongtong&quot; music, more exclusive to Madura, is played on several wooden or bamboo drums, and often accompanies bull-racing competitions.

===Vessels===
The Madurese are considered to be excellent sailors. Madurese vessels loaded with cargoes of wood from other islands, like Borneo, used to ply their trade between Indonesia and Singapore. Traditional vessels of Madura include the golekan, leti leti (or leteh-leteh), lis-alis, and janggolan.

<doc id="183983" wikidata="Q597616" url="?curid=183983" title="Corymbia ficifolia">
<text>Corymbia ficifolia, commonly known as red flowering gum, is a species of small tree that is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shape adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, bright red, pink or orange flowers and urn-shaped fruit. It has a restricted distribution in the wild but is one of the most commonly planted ornamental eucalypts.

==Description==
&quot;Corymbia ficifolia&quot; is a straggly tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous brownish bark on the trunk and branches. The adult leaves are dull to slightly glossy, paler on the lower surface, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded to flattened operculum. Flowering occurs from December to May and the flowers are bright red to pink or orange. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit.

The other two bloodwoods found in the south-west of Western Australia are &quot;C. haemotoxylon&quot; and marri (&quot;C. calophylla&quot;). Unlike &quot;C. ficifolia&quot;, they have tessellated bark rather than fibrous bark.

==Taxonomy==
Red-flowering gum was first formally described in 1860 by Ferdinand von Mueller, who gave it the name &quot;Eucalyptus ficifolia&quot; and published the description in his book, &quot;Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae&quot;. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson changed the name to &quot;Corymbia ficifolia&quot;.

In 2009, Parra-O and colleagues published a combined analysis of nuclear rDNA (ETS + ITS) and morphological characters published to clarify relationships within the genus &quot;Corymbia&quot;. &quot;C. ficifolia&quot; was shown to comprise a natural group with two other Western Australian species &quot;C. calophylla&quot; and &quot;C. haematoxylon&quot;. They classified the group as section &quot;Calophyllae&quot; within the subgenus &quot;Corymbia&quot;.

The specific epithet &quot;ficifolia&quot; is from Latin &quot;ficus&quot; meaning &#x27;fig&#x27; and &quot;folium&quot; &#x27;leaf&#x27;, referring to the similarity of its leaves to some species of &quot;Ficus&quot;.

The type specimen was collected from around the Broke Inlet by George Maxwell.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Corymbia ficifolia&quot; grows in sandy soil in low forest on slopes and is restricted to a sub-coastal distribution south-east of Perth, east of Mount Frankland, Walpole and the Stirling Range.

==Use in horticulture==
Red-flowering gum is one of the most widely cultivated of all eucalypts, both in Australia and overseas. It is best suited to temperate districts with low summer rainfall and is rarely reliable on the east coast of Australia. In suitable climates it is moderately fast-growing and is often larger and more vigorous in cultivation than in the wild. Eucalypts are difficult to grow from cuttings and are usually grown from seed. As a result, flower colour cannot be guaranteed, although some small forms have become available as grafted plants.

In nature &quot;Corymbia ficifolia&quot; prefers infertile, sandy soils but it is readily adaptable to most temperate locations, provided it is not exposed to severe frost or sustained tropical damp. It is an ideal street tree as it is hardy, moderately fast growing, and rarely grows large enough to require pruning. The largest known single-stemmed tree of this species in the world (216.5 cm diameter) is located on Princes Street in Hamilton, New Zealand. Because of its big and lovely colourful flowers, genetic improvement for cold resistance in Dublin area in Ireland is being carried out by collecting seeds in the coldest parts of Western and Southern Australia where it grows. In Ireland most of the plants were killed by severe frosts but the surviving shoots have been kept by tissue culture.

<text>Jean Henri Georges Laguerre (24 June 1858 - 17 June 1912) was a French lawyer and politician.

Born in Paris, he was called to the bar in 1879 and distinguished himself by brilliant pleadings in favour of socialist and anarchist leaders, defending Prince Kropotkine at Lyon in 1883, and Louise Michel in the same year. In 1886, with Alexandre Millerand as a colleague, he defended Ernest Roche and Duc Quercy, the instigators of the Decazeville strike. His strictures on the &quot;procureur de la Republique&quot; on this occasion being declared libellous he was suspended for six months and in 1890 he again incurred suspension for an attack on the attorney-general, Quesnay de Beaurepaire.

He pleaded in the greatest criminal cases of his time, but from 1893 onwards exclusively in the provinces, his exclusion from the Parisian bar having been secured on the pretext of his connection with &quot;La Presse&quot;. He entered the Chamber of Deputies for Apt in 1883 as a representative of the extreme revisionist programme, and was one of the leaders of the Boulangist agitation. He had formerly written for Georges Clemenceau&#x27;s organ &quot;La Justice&quot;, but when Clemenceau refused to impose any shibboleth on the radical party he became director of &quot;La Presse&quot;. He rallied to the republican party in May 1891 some months before General Boulanger&#x27;s suicide. He was not re-elected to the Chamber in 1893.

Laguerre was an excellent lecturer on the revolutionary period of French history, concerning which he had collected many valuable and rare documents. He interested himself in the fate of the &quot;Little Dauphin&quot; (Louis XVII), whose supposed remains, buried at Ste Marguerite, proved to be those of a boy of fourteen.

<text>The Foss Dyke, or Fossdyke, connects the River Trent at Torksey to Lincoln, the county town of Lincolnshire, and may be the oldest canal in England that is still in use. It is usually thought to have been built around AD 120 by the Romans, but there is no consensus among authors. It was refurbished in 1121, during the reign of King Henry I, and responsibility for its maintenance was transferred to the city of Lincoln by King James I. Improvements made in 1671 included a navigable sluice or lock at Torksey, and warehousing and wharves were built at Brayford Pool in the centre of Lincoln.

Connection to the River Witham at Brayford was hampered by the small bore and depth of High Bridge, a medieval structure just below the pool. The channel through it was made deeper in 1795, but John Rennie&#x27;s plans to demolish it in 1803 were not adopted. The canal was leased to several generations of the Ellison family, who profited from the tolls but failed to maintain it. Although cargoes of coal and wool moved to the railway, the carriage of grain continued, and the last commercial operation was in 1972. The Brayford Mere Trust have turned Brayford Pool into a marina, and the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership are opening a footpath and cycleway from Lincoln to Torksey; the section to Saxilby was officially opened on 26 July 2011.

==Route==
The Foss Dyke joins the River Trent at Torksey. A branch leaves the main channel, passes under the A156 bridge, and immediately enters Torksey lock, which is the only lock on the canal. It has six sets of gates, three sets facing Lincoln, and three facing the river, which is tidal at this point, and so its level can be higher than the level of the canal. The gates allow the lock to be used at most states of the tide. A steel footbridge crosses the lock near the road, and both the footbridge and the lock are grade II listed structures. The canal runs to the east, and then turns south, passing to the east of Fenton and Kettlethorpe. Soon it is joined by the A57, and turns east again. The road runs along the south bank, until Saxilby is reached.

At Saxilby, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway crosses the waterway, to run along the south bank all the way to Lincoln. There was once a swing bridge beyond the railway bridge, which was removed in 1937, although the foundations are still obvious. Access over the canal at this point was reinstated in 1987, when a footbridge was installed. The original bridge was manufactured in 1884, and crossed the Great Northern Railway at Newark-on-Trent for 103 years before it was put to a new use. The A57 crosses to the north bank soon after the railway bridge. The River Till flows south and under the road to join the Foss Dyke, after which a new marina has been built at Burton Waters. Because the construction has breached the flood bank, it is protected by a flood gate. The canal crosses under the A46 on the outskirts of Lincoln, and then over a drainage ditch, to run alongside the Carholme golf club. The final bridge carries the B1273 Brayford Way over the canal as it enters Brayford Pool, once a busy commercial wharf in the centre of Lincoln, but now a marina with the University of Lincoln on the southern bank. The unnavigable River Witham flows into the bottom end of the pool, and becomes the Witham Navigation when it flows out on its way to Boston.

==History==
The Foss Dyke was long thought to have been constructed by the Romans around 120. Pointers include an inscribed statuette of the god Mars found in it at Torksey, which is now in the British Museum, but there is a lack of consensus among authors writing on the subject.

The first record of it comes from Symeon of Durham, whose &quot;Historia Regium&quot; notes the following for the year 1121:

Some take this to mean that the canal did not exist before Henry&#x27;s construction work. Thus Kevin Leahy writes:

Others, though, consider that Henry I merely scoured out an existing structure; Mark Bennett, writing for the East Midlands Archaeological Research Framework says:

The canal is about long. It possibly follows an earlier line of the Trent, which emptied into the Wash prior to the end of the last Ice Age. Together with the Car Dyke it formed part an important transport route from Peterborough to York.

It was reputedly used by the Danes when they invaded England and by the Normans to carry stone to build Lincoln Cathedral in the 11th century. Following King Henry I&#x27;s work discussed above, the canal deteriorated, until by the 17th century it was virtually impassable. Katherine Swynford, who lived in the area, is credited with having organized a protest to repair it, in 1375. King James I transferred ownership to the Corporation of Lincoln.
In 1671, during the reign of Charles II, Lincoln obtained an act of Parliament, the (22 &amp; 23 Cha. 2. c. &quot;25&quot;) which authorised improvements from Boston to the Trent. Work was carried out on the Foss Dyke, but only the first of the Witham, from Brayford Pool to High Bridge, received attention. The work was carried out by Samuel Fortrey, a man with previous experience of draining the fens. He was required to bear some of the cost himself, in exchange for some of the profits. The work was completed in 1672, and included a navigable sluice or lock at Torksey, which had first been proposed by Simon Hill in 1632. Warehouses and wharves were built at Brayford Pool, but by 1717, passage from Torksey was again difficult. Coal traffic averaged per year, bound for Lincoln, but tolls were insufficient to finance repairs. The city of Lincoln did not have the expertise to manage the waterway, and so leased it to Richard Ellison in 1741, who had experience with the River Don Navigation. He paid £75 per year for a navigation which generated around £100 in toll receipts. He dredged it to provide of depth, and re-opened it in 1744. Two years later, the tolls were £595, and continued to increase. Under his son, the tolls were £2,367 in 1789, while his grandson collected £5,159 in 1811.

Navigation through Lincoln and on to Boston was hampered by the shallow draught available under the medieval High Bridge, just below Brayford Pool. Sir Joseph Banks, when proposing the construction of the Horncastle Canal knew that the problem needed addressing, and William Jessop was commissioned to survey the Witham and the Foss Dyke in 1791, with particular reference to the junction between the two. He proposed a bypass to the south of the city, using the Sincil Dyke, or excavating the channel beneath the bridge, although he recognized that this solution was not ideal, due to the narrow width of the bridge hole, and the lack of a towing path through it. However, the city was keen to keep trade within its limits, and improvements to High Bridge, which were completed by 1795, were authorised as part of the Horncastle Canal Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 107).

The Witham Navigation was soon needing repairs, and the commissioners asked John Rennie for advice in 1802. His report, published in 1803, included recommendations to demolish High Bridge so that a waterway wide could be built under a new bridge, and improvements to the Foss Dyke costing £12,260. Neither action was followed. The canal was difficult to maintain, because much of it ran through sand and quicksand. The situation was more complex, because it had been leased to the Ellisons for three generations, and Richard Ellison III was not keen to spend any money on it. Income from tolls would have more than covered repairs, but there was little that could be done. A challenge to the legality of his lease was considered in the 1820s, but was not thought likely to succeed. He died in 1827, and Humphrey Sibthorp, his niece&#x27;s husband, who was a proprietor on the River Witham, took over responsibility for it. He asked Isambard Brunel to survey it, and although he did so in 1833, no improvements were made.
Railways arrived in Lincoln in 1848. The Wakefield, Lincoln and Boston Railway had negotiated with the proprietors of the Witham and Foss Dyke in 1846, to guarantee them an income by leasing the waterways. Richard Ellison IV had agreed a lease for 894 years, at £9,570 per year, based on the average profit for the previous three years plus 5 per cent. This was authorised by the (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. &quot;18&quot;). The line was built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR), who took over the leases already agreed. The Witham was affected more than the Foss Dyke, as the line followed its bank from Lincoln to Boston. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MSLR) passed through Saxilby to Lincoln a little later. Combined figures for the two waterways showed a drop in goods carried of two-thirds between 1848 and 1868. Cargoes of coal and wool were the first to transfer to the railways. However, the MSLR, by then renamed the Great Central Railway (GCR), built a dock and transshipment warehouse at Brayford in 1897. The Foss Dyke carried in 1905, and an average of between 1913 and 1917, most of it general goods and agricultural produce. A series of takeovers and mergers resulted in its ownership changing several times, before it was nationalised, and became the responsibility of the British Waterways Board in 1948.

Although its date of construction is unknown, the London and North Eastern Railway (successors of both the GNR and the GCR) built a small pumping station to the west of Torksey lock. It contained a steam-powered beam engine, which was probably made by Davy Brothers of Sheffield, and drove a double-acting bucket pump. It was situated close to the land drainage pumping station, which pumps into the tidal part of the Foss Dyke, draining some of low-lying land to the south of Torksey. Its job was to maintain the water levels in the navigation, but it was demolished in 1936, and no traces of it remain. A new pumping station at a similar location was commissioned in 1974. This forms part of the Trent–Witham–Ancholme transfer scheme. A pumping station at Short Ferry on Barlings Eau pumps water through an pipeline to Toft Newton reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Ancholme. The water is used to maintain the flow and level of the Ancholme during the summer months and other dry periods. When there is insufficient water in Barlings Eau and the Witham, Torksey pumping station transfers water from the Trent through a short pipeline into Foss Dyke. From there it flows for along the waterway to Brayford Pool and so into the Witham, to supplement the water available for pumping.

==Restoration==
Unlike many waterways, the Foss Dyke never closed, and continued to carry grain traffic until 1972. However, the demise of general commercial traffic had left Brayford Pool in the centre of Lincoln as a derelict body of water, full of debris such as rubbish and sunken boats. The local Chamber of Commerce sought to address the issue in 1965, and formed Brayford Improvement Committee. Advice was sought from the Inland Waterways Association, and eventually the Brayford Mere Trust was constituted. They removed the wrecks from the pool, and have rebuilt the site, so that it offers facilities for visiting pleasure craft, now the major users of the waterway. A former lift bridge, which crossed the western entrance to the pool, was replaced in August 1996 by a new concrete flyover, as part of the redevelopment of the south bank, which included the opening of the University of Lincoln in the same year. to the west of Lincoln, a new marina has been constructed at Burton Waters, as part of a housing development.

Construction of a footpath and cycleway beside the canal from Lincoln to Saxilby has been carried out by the Lincolnshire Waterways Partnership, a joint initiative by Lincolnshire County Council, the Environment Agency and British Waterways. For much of its route it runs along the top of the northern floodbank, but drops down to a new crossing of the A57 road and a new bridge across the River Till near Saxilby. The route was officially opened on 26 July 2011. Extending the path to Torksey is a longer-term aim.

<text>Jean-Gilbert Victor Fialin, Duc de Persigny (11 January 1808 – 12 January 1872) was a of the Second French Empire.

== Biography ==
Fialin was born at Saint-Germain-Lespinasse in the Loire, where his father was Receiver of Taxes, and was educated at Limoges. He entered Saumur Cavalry School in 1826, becoming &quot;Maréchal des logis&quot; in the 4th Hussars two years later. The role played by his regiment in the July Revolution of 1830 was regarded as insubordination, resulting in Fialin being dismissed from the army. He then became a journalist, and after 1833, a strong Bonapartist, assuming the style &quot;vicomte de Persigny&quot;, said to be dormant in his family.

He was involved in the abortive Bonapartist coups at Strasbourg in 1836 and at Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1840. After the second coup, he was arrested and condemned to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment in a fortress, commuted to mild detention at Versailles. There he wrote a book to prove that the Egyptian pyramids were built to prevent the Nile from silting up. The book was published in 1845 under the title &quot;De la destination et de l&#x27;utilité permanente des Pyramides&quot;.

During the 1848 Revolution, Fialin was arrested by the Provisional Government. After his release, he played a prominent part in securing Prince Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s election to the presidency. Together with Morny and Marshal Saint Arnaud he plotted the Restoration of the Empire, and was a devoted adherent of Napoleon III. He succeeded Morny as French Minister of the Interior in January 1852, and became senator later that year. He resigned in 1854, and was appointed Ambassador to London the next year, a post he occupied with a short interval (1858–1859) until 1860, when he resumed the portfolio at the Interior Ministry. But the growing influence of his rival Rouher prompted his resignation in 1863, after which Napoleon created him a duke.

A more dangerous enemy than Rouher was Empress Eugénie, whose marriage Fialin had opposed and whose presence on the Council he deprecated in a memorandum which was leaked to the Empress.

He sought in vain to see Napoleon before the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and the breach was further widened when the master and servant were in exile. Persigny returned to France in 1871 and died in Nice on 12 January 1872.

A devoted and fanatical follower of Louis-Napoleon, whose service dated back to the future Emperor&#x27;s wilderness years of exile and imprisonment, Persigny stood out among the Emperor&#x27;s motley political entourage as the most passionate ideologue of Bonapartism. The Emperor&#x27;s famous wry comment: &quot;The Empress is a Legitimist, Morny is an Orleanist, Prince Napoleon is a Republican, and I myself am a Socialist. There is only one Bonapartist, Persigny – and he is mad!&quot;

<text>Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is a hypophysiotropic hormone produced by neurons in the hypothalamus that stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and prolactin from the anterior pituitary.

TRH has been used clinically for the treatment of spinocerebellar degeneration and disturbance of consciousness in humans. Its pharmaceutical form is called protirelin (INN) ().

== Synthesis and release ==
TRH is synthesized within parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. It is translated as a 242-amino acid precursor polypeptide that contains 6 copies of the sequence -Gln-His-Pro-Gly-, with both ends of the sequence flanked by Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg sequences.

To produce the mature form, a series of enzymes are required. First, a protease cleaves to the C-terminal side of the flanking Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg. Second, a carboxypeptidase removes the Lys/Arg residues leaving Gly as the C-terminal residue. Then, this Gly is converted into an amide residue by a series of enzymes collectively known as peptidylglycine-alpha-amidating monooxygenase. Concurrently with these processing steps, the N-terminal Gln (glutamine) is converted into pyroglutamate (a cyclic residue). These multiple steps produce 6 copies of the mature TRH molecule per precursor molecule for human TRH (5 for mouse TRH).

TRH synthesizing neurons of the paraventricular nucleus project to the medial portion of the external layer of the median eminence. Following secretion at the median eminence, TRH travels to the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal system where it binds to the TRH receptor stimulating the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone from thyrotropes and prolactin from lactotropes. The half-life of TRH in the blood is approximately 6 minutes.

== Structure ==

TRH is a tripeptide, with an amino acid sequence of pyroglutamyl-histidyl-proline amide.

== History ==

The structure of TRH was first determined, and the hormone synthesized, by Roger Guillemin and Andrew V. Schally in 1969. Both parties insisted their labs determined the sequence first: Schally first suggested the possibility in 1966, but abandoned it after Guillemin proposed TRH was not actually a peptide. Guillemin&#x27;s chemist began concurring with these results in 1969, as NIH threatened to cut off funding for the project, leading both parties to return to work on synthesis.

Schally and Guillemin shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine &quot;for their discoveries concerning the peptide hormone production of the brain.&quot; News accounts of their work often focused on their &quot;fierce competition&quot; and use of a very large amount of sheep and pig brains to locate the hormone.

== Clinical significance ==
TRH is used clinically by intravenous injection (brand name Relefact TRH) to test the response of the anterior pituitary gland; this procedure is known as a TRH test. This is done as diagnostic test of thyroid disorders such as secondary hypothyroidism and in acromegaly.

TRH has anti-depressant and anti-suicidal properties, and in 2012 the U.S. Army awarded a research grant to develop a TRH nasal spray in order to prevent suicide amongst its ranks. The antidepressant properties of TRH are present when TRH is administered intrathecally, or administration into the spine, and the effects are short-lived. Some researchers are testing a prodrug approach to administer TRH orally and have TRH reach the brain without being degraded in the stomach or blood.

TRH has been shown in mice to be an anti-aging agent with a broad spectrum of activities that, because of their actions, suggest that TRH has a fundamental role in the regulation of metabolic and hormonal functions.

== Side effects ==

Side effects after intravenous TRH administration are minimal. Nausea, flushing, urinary urgency, and mild rise in blood pressure have been reported. After intrathecal administration, shaking, sweating, shivering, restlessness, and mild rise in blood pressure were observed.

<text>In cosmology and physics, cold dark matter (CDM) is a hypothetical type of dark matter. According to the current standard model of cosmology, Lambda-CDM model, approximately 27% of the universe is dark matter and 68% is dark energy, with only a small fraction being the ordinary baryonic matter that composes stars, planets, and living organisms. &quot;Cold&quot; refers to the fact that the dark matter moves slowly compared to the speed of light, giving it a vanishing equation of state. &quot;Dark&quot; indicates that it interacts very weakly with ordinary matter and electromagnetic radiation. Proposed candidates for CDM include weakly interacting massive particles, primordial black holes, and axions.

== History ==

The theory of cold dark matter was originally published in 1982 by James Peebles; while the warm dark matter picture was proposed independently at the same time by J. Richard Bond, Alex Szalay, and Michael Turner; and George Blumenthal, H. Pagels, and Joel Primack.
A review article in 1984 by Blumenthal, Sandra Moore Faber, Primack, and Martin Rees developed the details of the theory.

==Structure formation==

In the cold dark matter theory, structure grows hierarchically, with small objects collapsing under their self-gravity first and merging in a continuous hierarchy to form larger and more massive objects. Predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm are in general agreement with observations of cosmological large-scale structure. 

In the hot dark matter paradigm, popular in the early 1980s but less so in the 1990s, structure does not form hierarchically (&quot;bottom-up&quot;), but forms by fragmentation (&quot;top-down&quot;), with the largest superclusters forming first in flat pancake-like sheets and subsequently fragmenting into smaller pieces like our galaxy the Milky Way.

Since the late 1980s or 1990s, most cosmologists favor the cold dark matter theory (specifically the modern Lambda-CDM model) as a description of how the universe went from a smooth initial state at early times (as shown by the cosmic microwave background radiation) to the lumpy distribution of galaxies and their clusters we see today—the large-scale structure of the universe. Dwarf galaxies are crucial to this theory, having been created by small-scale density fluctuations in the early universe; they have now become natural building blocks that form larger structures.

==Composition==
Dark matter is detected through its gravitational interactions with ordinary matter and radiation. As such, it is very difficult to determine what the constituents of cold dark matter are. The candidates fall roughly into three categories:

* Axions, very light particles with a specific type of self-interaction that makes them a suitable CDM candidate. Since the late 2010s, axions have become one of the most promising candidates for dark matter. Axions have the theoretical advantage that their existence solves the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics, but axion particles have only been theorized and never detected. Axions are an example of a more general category of particle called a WISP (weakly interacting &quot;slender&quot; or &quot;slim&quot; particle), which are the low-mass counterparts of WIMPs. 

* Massive compact halo objects (MACHOs), large, condensed objects such as black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, very faint stars, or non-luminous objects like planets. The search for these objects consists of using gravitational lensing to detect the effects of these objects on background galaxies. Most experts believe that the constraints from those searches rule out MACHOs as a viable dark matter candidate.

* Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). There is no currently known particle with the required properties, but many extensions of the standard model of particle physics predict such particles. The search for WIMPs involves attempts at direct detection by highly sensitive detectors, as well as attempts at production of WIMPs by particle accelerators. Historically, WIMPs were regarded as one of the most promising candidates for the composition of dark matter, but since the late 2010s, WIMPs have been supplanted by axions with the non-detection of WIMPs in experiments. The DAMA/NaI experiment and its successor DAMA/LIBRA have claimed to have directly detected dark matter particles passing through the Earth, but many scientists remain skeptical because no results from similar experiments seem compatible with the DAMA results.

== Challenges ==

Several discrepancies between the predictions of cold dark matter in the ΛCDM model and observations of galaxies and their clustering have arisen. Some of these problems have proposed solutions, but it remains unclear whether they can be solved without abandoning the ΛCDM model.

===Cuspy halo problem===

The density distributions of dark matter halos in cold dark matter simulations (at least those that do not include the impact of baryonic feedback) are much more peaked than what is observed in galaxies by investigating their rotation curves.

===Dwarf galaxy problem===
Cold dark matter simulations predict large numbers of small dark matter halos, more numerous than the number of small dwarf galaxies that are observed around galaxies like the Milky Way.

===Satellite disk problem===
Dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are observed to be orbiting in thin, planar structures whereas the simulations predict that they should be distributed randomly about their parent galaxies.

===High-velocity galaxy problem===
Galaxies in the NGC 3109 association are moving away too rapidly to be consistent with expectations in the ΛCDM model. In this framework, NGC 3109 is too massive and distant from the Local Group for it to have been flung out in a three-body interaction involving the Milky Way or Andromeda Galaxy.

===Galaxy morphology problem===
If galaxies grew hierarchically, then massive galaxies required many mergers. Major mergers inevitably create a classical bulge. On the contrary, about 80% of observed galaxies give evidence of no such bulges, and giant pure-disc galaxies are commonplace. The tension can be quantified by comparing the observed distribution of galaxy shapes today with predictions from high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulations in the ΛCDM framework, revealing a highly significant problem that is unlikely to be solved by improving the resolution of the simulations. The high bulgeless fraction was nearly constant for 8 billion years.

===Fast galaxy bar problem===
If galaxies were embedded within massive halos of cold dark matter, then the bars that often develop in their central regions would be slowed down by dynamical friction with the halo. This is in serious tension with the fact that observed galaxy bars are typically fast.

===Small-scale crisis===
Comparison of the model with observations may have some problems on sub-galaxy scales, possibly predicting too many dwarf galaxies and too much dark matter in the innermost regions of galaxies. This problem is called the &quot;small scale crisis&quot;. These small scales are harder to resolve in computer simulations, so it is not yet clear whether the problem is the simulations, non-standard properties of dark matter, or a more radical error in the model.

===High redshift galaxies===
Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope have resulted in various galaxies confirmed by spectroscopy at high redshift, such as JADES-GS-z13-0 at cosmological redshift of 13.2 or JADES-GS-z14-0 at cosmological redshift of 14.32. Such a high rate of large galaxy formation in the early universe appears to contradict the rates of galaxy formation allowed in the existing Lambda CDM model via dark matter halos, as even if galaxy formation were 100% efficient and all mass were allowed to turn into stars in Lambda CDM, it wouldn&#x27;t be enough to create such large galaxies. However, this depends upon assuming a stellar initial mass function. If early star formation favored massive stars, this could explain the tension.

<text>Hysteria is a term used to mean ungovernable emotional excess and can refer to a temporary state of mind or emotion. In the nineteenth century, female hysteria was considered a diagnosable physical illness in women. It is assumed that the basis for diagnosis operated under the belief that women are predisposed to mental and behavioral conditions; an interpretation of sex-related differences in stress responses. In the twentieth century, it shifted to being considered a mental illness. Many influential people such as Sigmund Freud and Jean-Martin Charcot dedicated research to hysteria patients.

Currently, most physicians do not accept hysteria as a medical diagnosis. The blanket diagnosis of hysteria has been fragmented into myriad medical categories such as epilepsy, histrionic personality disorder, conversion disorders, dissociative disorders, or other medical conditions. Furthermore, lifestyle choices, such as choosing not to wed, are no longer considered symptoms of psychological disorders such as hysteria.

==History==
The word hysteria originates from the Greek word for uterus, &quot;hystera&quot;. The oldest record of hysteria dates back to 1900 BCE when Egyptians recorded behavioral abnormalities in adult women on the Kahun Papyrus. The Egyptians attributed the behavioral disturbances to a wandering uterusthus the condition later being dubbed hysteria. To treat hysteria Egyptian doctors prescribed various medications. For example, doctors put strong smelling substances on the patients&#x27; vulvas to encourage the uterus to return to its proper position. Another tactic was to smell or swallow unsavory herbs to encourage the uterus to flee back to the lower part of the female&#x27;s abdomen.

The ancient Greeks accepted the ancient Egyptians&#x27; explanation for hysteria; however, they included in their definition of hysteria the inability to bear children or the unwillingness to marry. Plato and Aristotle believed that hysteria, which Plato also called female madness, was directly related to these women&#x27;s lack of sexual activity and described the uterus of those who suffered from it as a sad, bad, or melancholic uterus. In the 5th century BCE Hippocrates first used the term hysteria. Ancient Romans also attributed hysteria to an abnormality in the womb; however, discarded the traditional explanation of a wandering uterus. Instead, the ancient Romans credited hysteria to a disease of the womb or a disruption in reproduction (i.e., a miscarriage, menopause, etc.). Hysteria theories from the ancient Egyptians, ancient Greeks, and ancient Romans were the basis of the Western understanding of hysteria.

Between the fifth and thirteenth centuries, however, the increasing influence of Christianity in the Latin West altered medical and public understanding of hysteria. St. Augustine&#x27;s writings suggested that human suffering resulted from sin, thus hysteria became perceived as satanic possession. With the shift in perception of hysteria came a shift in treatment options. Instead of admitting patients to a hospital, the church began treating patients through prayers, amulets, and exorcisms. At this time, writings such as Constantine the African&#x27;s &quot;Viaticum&quot; and &quot;Pantegni&quot;, described women with hysteria as the cause of amor heroycus, a form of sexual desire so strong that it caused madness, rather than someone with a problem who should be cured.

Trota de Ruggiero is considered the first female doctor in Christian Europe as well as the first gynecologist, though she could not become a . She recognized that women were often ashamed to go to a doctor with gynecological issues, and studied women&#x27;s diseases and attempted to avoid common misconceptions and prejudice of the era. She prescribed remedies such as mint for women suffering from hysteria. Hildegard of Bingen was another female doctor, whose work was part of an attempt to combine science and faith. She agreed with the theories of Hippocrates and suggested hysteria may be connected to the idea of original sin; She believed that men and women were both responsible for original sin, and could both suffer from hysteria. Furthermore, during the Renaissance period many patients of hysteria were prosecuted as witches and underwent interrogations, torture, exorcisms, and execution. During this time the common point of view was that women were inferior beings, connected to Aristotle&#x27;s ideas of male superiority. Saint Thomas Aquinas supported this idea and in his writing, Summa Theologica stated &quot;&#x27;some old women&#x27; are evil-minded; they gaze on children in a poisonous and evil way, and demons, with whom the witches enter into agreements, interacting through their eyes&quot;. This type of fear of witches and sorcery is part of the rules of celibacy and chastity imposed on the clergy. Philippe Pinel believed that there was little difference between madness and healthy people, and believed that people should be treated if they were unwell. He considered hysteria a female disorder.

However, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries activists and scholars worked to change the perception of hysteria back to a medical condition. Particularly, French physician Charles Le Pois insisted that hysteria was a malady of the brain. In addition, in 1697, English physician Thomas Sydenham theorized that hysteria was an emotional condition, instead of a physical condition. Many physicians followed Lepois and Sydenham&#x27;s lead and hysteria became disassociated with the soul and the womb. During this time period, science started to focalize hysteria in the central nervous system. As doctors developed a greater understanding of the human nervous system, the neurological model of hysteria was created, which further propelled the conception of hysteria as a mental disorder. Joseph Raulin published a work in 1748, associating hysteria with the air quality in cities, he suggested that men and women could both have hysteria, women would be more likely to have it due to laziness.

In 1859 Paul Briquet defined hysteria as a chronic syndrome manifesting in many unexplained symptoms throughout the body&#x27;s organ systems. What Briquet described became known as Briquet&#x27;s syndrome, or Somatization disorders, in 1971. Over a ten-year period, Briquet conducted 430 case studies of patients with hysteria. Following Briquet, Jean-Martin Charcot studied women in an asylum in France and used hypnosis as treatment. Charcot detailed the intricacies of hysteria, understanding it as being caused by patriarchy. He also mentored Pierre Janet, another French psychologist, who studied five of hysteria&#x27;s symptoms (anaesthesia, amnesia, abulia, motor control diseases, and character change) in depth and proposed that hysteria symptoms occurred due to a lapse in consciousness. Both Charcot and Janet inspired Freud&#x27;s work. Freud theorized hysteria stemmed from childhood sexual abuse or repression. Briquet, Freud and Charcot noted male hysteria; both genders could exhibit the syndrome. Hysterics may be able to manipulate their caretakers thus complicating treatment.

L.E. Emerson was a Freudian who worked at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital and saw hysteric patients. Investigating the files, Elizabeth Lunbeck found that most of hysteric patients at this hospital, were typically single, either being young or purposefully avoiding men due to past sexual abuse. Emerson published case studies on his patients and was interested in the stories they told, relating their stories to sex and their inner sexual conflicts. Emerson stated that their hysteria, which ranged from self-harm to immense guilt for what happened, was due to the patients&#x27; traumas or a lack of sexual knowledge, to which he stated that they were sexually repressed.

During the twentieth century, as psychiatry advanced in the West, anxiety and depression diagnoses began to replace hysteria diagnoses in Western countries. For example, from 1949 to 1978, annual admissions of hysteria patients in England and Wales decreased by roughly two-thirds. With the decrease of hysteria patients in Western cultures came an increase in anxiety and depression patients. Theories for why hysteria diagnoses began to decline vary, but many historians infer that World WarII, along with the use of the diagnosis of shell-shock, westernization, and migration shifted Western mental health expectations. Twentieth-century western societies expected depression and anxiety manifest itself more in post World War II generations and displaced individuals; and thus, individuals reported or were diagnosed accordingly. In addition, medical advancements explained ailments that were previously attributed to hysteria such as epilepsy or infertility. World Wars caused military doctors to become focused on hysteria as during this time there seemed to be a rise in cases, especially under instances of high stress, in 1919 Arthur Frederick Hurst wrote that &quot;many cases of gross hysterical symptoms occurred in soldiers who had no family or personal history of neuroses, and who were perfectly fit&quot;. In 1970 Colin P. McEvedy and Alanson W. Beard suggested that Royal Free Disease (Royal Free Hospital outbreak, now also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome a neurological disease), which mainly affected young women, was an epidemic of hysteria. They also said that hysteria had a historically negative connotation, however that should not prevent doctors from assessing symptoms of the patient. In 1980, after a gradual decline in diagnoses and reports, hysteria was removed from the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which had included hysteria as a mental disorder from its second publication in 1968.

The term is still used in the twenty-first century, though not as a diagnosis. When used, it is often a general term for any dramatic displays of outrage or emotion.

==Notable theorists==
===Charcot===
In the late nineteenth century, French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot tackled what he referred to as &quot;the great neurosis&quot; or hysteria. Charcot theorized that hysteria was a hereditary, physiological disorder. He believed hysteria impaired areas of the brain which provoked the physical symptoms displayed in each patient. While Charcot believed hysteria was hereditary, he also thought that environmental factors such as stress could trigger hysteria in an individual.

Charcot published more than 120 case studies of patients who he diagnosed with hysteria, including Marie Wittman. Whittman was referred to as the &quot;Queen of Hysterics&quot;, and remains the most famous patient of hysteria. To treat his patients, Charcot used hypnosis, which he determined was successful only when used on hysterics. Using patients as props, Charcot executed dramatic public demonstrations of hysterical patients and his cures for hysteria, which many suggest produced the hysterical phenomenon. Furthermore, Charcot noted similarities between demon possession and hysteria, and thus, he concluded &quot;demonomania&quot; was a form of hysteria.

===Freud===
In 1896 Sigmund Freud, an Austrian neurologist, published &quot;The Aetiology of Hysteria&quot;. The paper explains how Freud believes his female patients&#x27; neurosis, which he labels hysteria, resulted from sexual abuse as children. Freud named the concept of physical symptoms resulting from childhood trauma: hysterical conversion. Freud hypothesized that in order to cure hysteria the patient must relive the experiences through imagination in the most vivid form while under light hypnosis. Freud later adapted this, realizing that sexual abuse must not be the only way of developing neuroses. He then theorized that, in addition to abuse, fantasies of sexual abuse could be responsible, though he never ruled out that sexual abuse could be the cause of illness, simply not the only possible cause. Freud was also one of the first noted psychiatrists to attribute hysteria to men. He diagnosed himself with hysteria, writing that he feared his work had exacerbated his condition.

==Modern perceptions==
For the most part, hysteria does not exist as a medical diagnosis in Western culture and has been replaced by other diagnoses such as conversion or functional disorders. The effects of hysteria as a diagnosable illness in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries has had a lasting effect on the medical treatment of women&#x27;s health. The term &quot;hysterical&quot;, applied to an individual, can mean that they are emotional, irrationally upset, or frenzied. When applied to a situation not involving panic, hysteria means that that situation is uncontrollably amusingthe connotation being that it invokes hysterical laughter.

<doc id="184004" wikidata="Q688684" url="?curid=184004" title="Great Central Railway">
<text>The Great Central Railway in England was formed when the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway changed its name in 1897, anticipating the opening in 1899 of its London Extension. On 1 January 1923, the company was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway.

==History==
===New name===
On assuming its new title, the Great Central Railway had a main line from Manchester London Road Station via , Sheffield Victoria, and Grimsby to . A second line left the line at Penistone and served , and Scunthorpe, before rejoining the Grimsby line at . Other lines linked Sheffield to Barnsley (via ) and Doncaster (via Rotherham) and also and Wrawby Junction. Branch lines in north Lincolnshire ran to Barton-upon-Humber and New Holland and served ironstone quarries in the Scunthorpe area. In the Manchester area, lines ran to Stalybridge and Glossop.

In the 1890s, the MS&amp;LR began constructing its Derbyshire lines, the first part of its push southwards. Leaving its east–west main line at Woodhouse Junction, some 5½ miles south-east of Sheffield, the line headed towards Nottingham, a golden opportunity to tap into colliery traffic in the north of the county before reaching the city. A loop line was built to serve its station in Chesterfield.

====Coat of arms====
The Great Central Railway was the first railway granted a coat of arms. It was granted on 25 February 1898 by the Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy Kings of Arms as:
Argent on a cross gules voided of the field between two wings in chief sable and as many daggers erect, in base of the second, in the fesse point a morion winged of the third, on a chief also of the second a pale of the first thereon eight arrows saltirewise banded also of the third, between on the dexter side three bendlets enhanced and on the sinister a fleur de lis or. And for the Crest on a Wreath of the Colours A representation of the front of a locomotive engine between two wings Or as the same are in the margin hereof more plainly depicted to be borne and used for ever hereafter by the said Corporation of the Great Central Railway Company on seals, shields, banners or otherwise according to the Laws of Arms.
The design included elements representing Manchester (&quot;gules ... three bendlets enhanced ... or&quot;); Sheffield (&quot;eight arrows saltirewise banded&quot;); Lincoln (&quot;gules ... a fleur de lis or&quot;); Leicester (&quot;two wings&quot;); and London (&quot;Argent ... a cross gules ... daggers erect&quot;). Also represented was Mercury (&quot;a morion winged [sable]&quot;). It was used on locomotives and coaches.

The London and North Eastern Railway and the British Transport Commission, successors of the GCR, were granted arms of their own incorporating the GCR motto &quot;Forward&quot;.

The Great Central Railway (1976) Company Limited applied to the College of Arms as the successors to British Transport Commission (Loughborough to Birstall Light Railway) for permission to utilise the coat of arms of the GCR. A new design incorporating the same armorial components, updated in the modern style was proposed, but was rejected in favour of the original.

===The &quot;London extension&quot;===
The MS&amp;LR obtained an act of Parliament, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Act 1893 (56 &amp; 57 Vict. c. lxxix), giving approval for its extension to London. On 1 August 1897, the railway&#x27;s name was changed to Great Central Railway by the (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. liv). Building work started in 1895, and the new line, 92 miles (147 km) in length, opened for coal traffic on 25 July 1898, for passenger traffic on 15 March 1899, and for goods traffic on 11 April 1899. It was designed for high-speed running throughout.

It is a commonly held myth that the nomenclature for the direction of travel on the new line was the opposite of standard UK railway practice, in that trains travelling to London were referred to as &quot;down&quot; trains, and those travelling away from the capital as &quot;up&quot; trains. It is supposed that it was a result of the GCR&#x27;s headquarters at the time being in Manchester. The mileposts on the Great Central did start at zero at Manchester London Road and increase down the main line via Woodhead, Sheffield Victoria, Woodhouse, and then down the London Extension to Marylebone, 205 route miles from Manchester.

However, official documents dated 21 July 1898, detailing the method of working of mineral trains on the London Extension (used to help consolidate the new earthworks before passenger traffic began in March 1899), clearly show that the direction of travel on the new line was conventional – up to London, down to Annesley. Furthermore, contemporary descriptions in newspapers of the trains running on the new line are explicit that up trains ran to London and down trains away from it. That made the Great Central unusual amongst British railways in that its down trains went towards its &quot;milepost zero&quot; and up trains went away from it, but the convention of up and down trains in relation to London was retained.

The new line was built from Annesley in Nottinghamshire to join the Metropolitan Railway (MetR) extension to Quainton Road, where the line became joint MetR/GCR owned (after 1903), and returned to GCR tracks at Canfield Place, near Finchley Road, for the final section to . In 1903, new rails were laid parallel to the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow to the junction north of Finchley Road, enabling more traffic to use Marylebone.

===Later history===
In 1902, the company introduced an express service from Bournemouth and Southampton to York and Newcastle upon Tyne. A year later, it began a through running express from Dover and Folkestone to Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Huddersfield, Halifax, Bradford and Manchester, avoiding London and opening up the South Coast to the Midlands and the North. The route from Banbury to Reading was over Great Western track and from there it traversed South Eastern Railway track via Aldershot and Guildford to Redhill and on to Folkestone and Dover.
At the same time, the Great Central was gaining a reputation for fast services to and from London. In May 1903, the company promoted its services as &quot;Rapid Travel in Luxury&quot;, and &quot;Sheffield without a stop&quot;, adopted on 1 July 1903, became a trademark for the company, with run in three hours, an average of nearly . Slip coaches were provided for passengers for Leicester and Nottingham.

On 2 April 1906, an &quot;alternative main line&quot; route from Grendon Underwood Junction near Aylesbury to Neasden in north-west London opened. The line was joint GCR/GWR between Ashendon Junction and Northolt Junction. It was built to increase traffic on the GCR by overcoming capacity constraints on the Metropolitan extension and as a result of disagreements between the MetR and GCR after the resignation of Sir Edward Watkin due to poor health. By the time the line was built, the companies had settled their differences.

On 1 January 1923, under the terms of the Railways Act 1921, the GCR amalgamated with several other railways to create the London and North Eastern Railway.

The GCR line was the last complete mainline railway to be built in Britain until section one of High Speed 1 opened in 2003 and was also one of the shortest-lived intercity railway lines. Yet in its early years, its steam-hauled Sheffield expresses were the fastest in the country.
==Closure==
The express services from London to destinations beyond Nottingham were withdrawn in 1960. The line was closed to passenger trains between Aylesbury and Rugby on 3 September 1966. A diesel multiple-unit service ran between and until withdrawal on 3 May 1969.

=== Line retention ===
Since 1996, Chiltern Railways has used the Great Central lines south of Aylesbury for local services into London, including the alternative route south of Haddenham and widened lines south of Neasden for its intercity main line from Birmingham to London. In 2008, in a scheme partly funded by the Department for Transport, about three miles of line north of Aylesbury as far as was brought back into passenger use. None of these lines are currently electrified.

Work started in 2019 on developing East West Rail, which will extend passenger services north of Aylesbury Vale Parkway through to meet a renewed to section of the old &#x27;Varsity Line&#x27; just beyond the site of the former Great Central station at Calvert. Services are expected to start in the mid-2020s.

==Acquisitions==
*The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway (LD&amp;ECR) opened in 1897, to link the coalfields with deep-water ports, and was intended to run from Sutton-on-Sea in Lincolnshire to Warrington in Lancashire. In the event only the section between Pyewipe Junction, near Lincoln and Chesterfield Market Place station and some branch lines were built. It was purchased by the GCR on 1 January 1907, to provide a better link between the London main line and the east coast.
*Wrexham, Mold and Connah&#x27;s Quay Railway was purchased 1 January 1905.
*North Wales and Liverpool Railway was acquired at the same time.
*&quot;Wigan Junction Railway&quot; was bought on 1 January 1906, as was the Liverpool, St Helens and South Lancashire Railway
*North Lindsey Light Railway Scunthorpe to Whitton opened throughout on 1 December 1910 and was worked by the GCR. It carried passengers, although its main freight was ironstone.

==Joint working==
Apart from the three branches in the Liverpool area, the GCR lines in the north of England were all east of Manchester but GCR trains could run from coast to coast by means of joint working with other railways. The largest of those utilized in this way were those under the Cheshire Lines Committee: the other participants were the Midland Railway and the Great Northern Railway, taking in both Liverpool and Southport. Other joint undertakings were (west to east):
*Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (GCR/LNWR)
*Oldham, Ashton and Guide Bridge Railway (GCR/LNWR)
*&quot;Macclesfield, Bollington and Marple Railway&quot; (GCR/NSR); including its Hayfield branch
*South Yorkshire Joint Railway (GCR, GNR, Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, MR and North Eastern Railway)
*Sheffield District Railway(GCR and MidR)
*&quot;West Riding and Grimsby Joint Railway&quot; (GCR/GNR) - giving access to Wakefield and thence to Leeds
*Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway - opened 1916 for freight traffic only.

There were also joint lines in the south:
*Aylesbury Station Joint Committee
*Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway
**Banbury Junction Railway
*Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway
**Watford Joint Railway

==Key officers==
For those in position before 1899, dates are as served for the MS&amp;LR.

===General Managers===
*1886–1902 Sir William Pollitt (knighted 1899, later Lord Stuart of Wortley)
*1902–1922 Sir Samuel Fay (knighted 1912)

===Locomotive Engineer===
*1894–1900 Harry Pollitt
*1900–1902 John George Robinson

===Chief Mechanical Engineer===
*1902–1922 John George Robinson, for whom the post was created

==GCR locomotives==
These could generally be divided into those intended for passenger work, especially those used on the London Extension and those for the heavy freight work.

*See Locomotives of the Great Central Railway

===Pollitt&#x27;s locomotives===
Taken over from the MS&amp;LR, mainly of class F2, 2-4-2 tank locomotives, and also classes D5 and D6 4-4-0 locomotives.

===Robinson locomotives===
During Robinson&#x27;s tenure, many of the larger express passenger engines came into being:
*Classes B1-B9: 4-6-0 tender locomotives
*Classes C4/5: 4-4-2 tender locomotives
*Classes D9-11: 4-4-0 tender locomotives
*Class J13: 0-6-0T
*Classes L1/L3: 2-6-4T

==Rolling stock==
===Coaching stock===
The following GCR coaches are preserved.
===Goods wagons and freight stock===
===Cranes===
==Major stations==
*London Marylebone
*Manchester London Road
*
*

==Wath marshalling yard==

The marshalling yard at Wath-upon-Dearne opened in November 1907. It was designed to cope with coal trains, full and empty; it was worked with electro-pneumatic signalling.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 30 March 1889, an excursion train was derailed at Penistone, Yorkshire due to a failure of an axle on the locomotive hauling it. A mail train ran into the wreckage at low speed. One person was killed and 61 were injured.
*On 17 November 1899, GCR goods guard, Charles Harry Bennion was stationed at Staveley Town Railway station, Derbyshire. At approximately 08.30 am his goods train from Staveley to Frodingham was working through the thick fog when it hit two ‘light engines’ due to a &#x27;signalling error&#x27;. Charles’ injuries were fatal and he died instantly.
*On 23 December 1904, an express passenger train was derailed at , Buckinghamshire due to excessive speed on a curve. Another express passenger train ran into the wreckage at low speed. Four people were killed.
*On 2 February 1908, the driver of a freight train sneezed, his head collided with that of his fireman, knocking both of them out. Due to excessive speed, a van in the train derailed approaching station, Yorkshire and the train overran signals there. It derailed completely at . 
*On 13 December 1911, a freight train ran away and was derailed at station, Yorkshire. Both locomotive crew were killed.
*About 1913, a coal train was derailed at Torside, Derbyshire. The crew of the locomotive may have been overcome by fumes in the Woodhead Tunnel.

==Docks==
===Grimsby docks===
Grimsby, dubbed the &quot;largest fishing port in the world&quot; in the early 20th century, owed its prosperity to the ownership by the GCR and its forebear, the MS&amp;LR. Coal and timber were among its biggest cargoes. The port had two main docks: the &quot;Alexandra Dock&quot; (named for Queen Alexandra) and the &quot;Royal Dock&quot; which was completed in 1852, linked by the Union Dock. The total area of docks was 104.25 acres (42 ha).

===Immingham Dock===
Completed in 1912, this dock covered and was mainly concerned with the movement of coal. On 22 July 2012, the docks held an open day to celebrate 100 years of operation.

===Ships===
The Great Central Railway operated a number of ships.

== Immingham museum ==
Immingham museum, which portrays the role of the Great Central Railway in the building of the docks and construction of the local rail network is home to the Great Central Railway Society archive. The museum is located in the Civic Centre, Pelham Road, Immingham and is open from 1pm to 4pm, Wednesday to Saturday from March through to November.

<text>René Marie Goblet (; 26 November 1828 – 13 September 1905) was a French politician, Prime Minister of France for a period in 1886–1887.

== Biography ==
He was born at Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais and was trained in law. Under the Second Empire, he helped found a Liberal journal, &quot;Le Progrès de la Somme&quot;, and in July 1871 he was sent by the &quot;département&quot; of the Somme to the National Assembly, where he took his place on the extreme left, as a member of the Republican Union parliamentary group (&quot;Union républicaine&quot;). Having failed to secure election in 1876, he was returned for Amiens the following year. He held a minor government office in 1879, and in 1882 became minister of the interior in the Freycinet cabinet. He was minister of education, fine arts and religion in Henri Brisson&#x27;s first cabinet in 1885, and again under Freycinet in 1886, when he greatly increased his reputation by an able defence of the government&#x27;s education proposals.

Meanwhile, his independence and outspokenness had alienated him from many of his party, and throughout his life he was frequently in conflict with his political associates, from Léon Gambetta downwards. On the fall of the Freycinet cabinet in December he formed a cabinet in which be reserved for himself the portfolios of the interior and of religion. The Goblet cabinet was unpopular from the outset, and it was with difficulty that anybody could be found to accept the ministry of foreign affairs, which was finally given to Gustave Flourens.

Then came what is known as the Schnaebele incident, the arrest on the German frontier of a French official named Schnaebele, which caused immense excitement in France. For some days Goblet took no definite decision, but left Flourens, who stood for peace, to fight it out with General Boulanger, the minister of war, who urged the despatch of an ultimatum. Although he finally intervened on the side of Flourens, and peace was preserved, his weakness in the face of Boulangist propaganda became a national danger.

Defeated on the budget in May 1887, his government resigned; but he returned to office next year as foreign minister in the radical administration of Charles Floquet. He was defeated at the polls by a Boulangist candidate in 1889, and sat in the senate from 1891 to 1893 when he returned to the popular chamber. In association with Édouard Locroy, Ferdinand Sarrien and Paul Peytral he drew up a republican programme which they put forward in &quot;La Petite République française&quot;. At the elections of 1898 he was defeated, and from then on took little part in public affairs. He died in Paris.

<text>Gustave Flourens (4 August 1838 in Paris – 3 April 1871) was a French Revolutionary leader and writer, son of the physiologist Jean Pierre Flourens (who was Professor at the &quot;Collège de France&quot; and deputy in 1838-1839). He was also the elder brother of Émile Flourens, who became minister of foreign affairs under the Third Republic.

At 25 years of age Flourens undertook in 1863, on behalf of his father, a course of lectures at the Collège de France, on the subject of the history of humankind. His theories as to the manifold origin of the human race gave offence to the clergy, and he was prevented from delivering further lectures. He then went to Brussels, where he published his lectures under the title of &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;homme&quot; (1863). Gustave Flourens then visited Constantinople and Athens and took part in the Cretan insurrection of 1866-1868; he was one of those chosen for a difficult mission to Athens on behalf of the Cretan Revolutionary Assembly. He attempted to convince influential people, such as Victor Hugo, to support the Cretan insurrection. Gustave Flourens then spent some time in Italy, where an article of his in the &quot;Fe polo d&#x27;Italia&quot; caused his arrest and imprisonment, and finally, having returned to France, nearly lost his life in a duel with Paul de Cassagnac, editor of the &quot;Pays&quot;.

In Paris he devoted his time to the cause of &quot;red republicanism&quot;, and begin writing articles in the &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; weekly newspaper. At length, having failed in an attempt to organize a revolution at Belleville on 7 February 1870, was compelled to flee from France. Returning to Paris on the downfall of Napoleon III, placed himself at the head of a body of 500 &quot;tirailleurs&quot; (sharpshooters). 

Because of his insurrectionary proceedings (he was one of the organizers of the October 1870 uprising against the provisional government&#x27;s moderate policy) he was taken prisoner at Créteil, near Vincennes, by the provisional government, and confined at Mazas on 7 December 1870, but was released by his men on the night of 21–22 January. On 18 March he joined the population&#x27;s uprising, was elected a member of the revolutionary Commune by the 20th arrondissement, and was named general. Gustave Flourens was one of the most active leaders of the insurrection, and after a sortie against the Versailles troops in the morning of 3 April, he fled into an inn near the bridge that separates Chatou and Rueil. There, after he was captured and disarmed by the Gendarmerie, he was murdered by Captain Jean-Marc Démaret. Besides his &quot;Science de l&#x27;homme&quot; (Paris, 1869), Flourens was also the author of numerous fugitive pamphlets.

==Possible influence on Jules Verne==
In his notes to modern editions of some of Jules Verne&#x27;s works William Butcher, citing the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; of 5 March 1978, has suggested that one of Verne&#x27;s most famous characters, Captain Nemo, is based on Gustave Flourens. This view has been challenged by Leonidas Kallivretakis.

== Friendship with Sarah Bernhardt ==
In her autobiography, My Double Life (p. 220), the actress Sarah Bernhardt described him as follows:

&quot;I also knew and frequently saw a mad sort of fellow, full of dreams and Utopian follies. His name was Flourens, and he was tall and nice-looking. He wanted every one to be happy and every one to have money, and he shot down the soldiers without reflecting that he was commencing by making one or more of them unhappy. Reasoning with him was impossible, but he was charming and brave. I saw him two days before his death. He came to see me with a very young girl who wanted to devote herself to dramatic art. I promised him to help her. Two days later the poor child came to tell me of the heroic death of Flourens. He had refused to surrender, and, stretching out his arms, had shouted to the hesitating soldiers, &#x27;Shoot, shoot! I should not have spared you!&#x27; And their bullets killed him.&quot;

<doc id="184011" wikidata="Q935731" url="?curid=184011" title="Infinitesimal strain theory">
<text>In continuum mechanics, the infinitesimal strain theory is a mathematical approach to the description of the deformation of a solid body in which the displacements of the material particles are assumed to be much smaller (indeed, infinitesimally smaller) than any relevant dimension of the body; so that its geometry and the constitutive properties of the material (such as density and stiffness) at each point of space can be assumed to be unchanged by the deformation.

With this assumption, the equations of continuum mechanics are considerably simplified. This approach may also be called small deformation theory, small displacement theory, or small displacement-gradient theory. It is contrasted with the finite strain theory where the opposite assumption is made.

The infinitesimal strain theory is commonly adopted in civil and mechanical engineering for the stress analysis of structures built from relatively stiff elastic materials like concrete and steel, since a common goal in the design of such structures is to minimize their deformation under typical loads. However, this approximation demands caution in the case of thin flexible bodies, such as rods, plates, and shells which are susceptible to significant rotations, thus making the results unreliable.

==Infinitesimal strain tensor==

For infinitesimal deformations of a continuum body, in which the displacement gradient tensor (2nd order tensor) is small compared to unity, i.e. formula_1, 
it is possible to perform a geometric linearization of any one of the finite strain tensors used in finite strain theory, e.g. the &quot;Lagrangian finite strain tensor&quot; formula_2, and the &quot;Eulerian finite strain tensor&quot; formula_3. In such a linearization, the non-linear or second-order terms of the finite strain tensor are neglected. Thus we have

formula_4
or
formula_5
and
formula_6
or
formula_7

This linearization implies that the Lagrangian description and the Eulerian description are approximately the same as there is little difference in the material and spatial coordinates of a given material point in the continuum. Therefore, the material displacement gradient tensor components and the spatial displacement gradient tensor components are approximately equal. Thus we have
formula_8
or
formula_9
where formula_10 are the components of the &quot;infinitesimal strain tensor&quot; formula_11, also called &quot;Cauchy&#x27;s strain tensor&quot;, &quot;linear strain tensor&quot;, or &quot;small strain tensor&quot;.

formula_12
or using different notation:
formula_13

Furthermore, since the deformation gradient can be expressed as formula_14 where formula_15 is the second-order identity tensor, we have
formula_16

Also, from the general expression for the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors we have
formula_17

===Geometric derivation===

Consider a two-dimensional deformation of an infinitesimal rectangular material element with dimensions formula_18 by formula_19 (Figure 1), which after deformation, takes the form of a rhombus. From the geometry of Figure 1 we have

formula_20

For very small displacement gradients, i.e., formula_1, we have
formula_22

The normal strain in the formula_23-direction of the rectangular element is defined by
formula_24
and knowing that formula_25, we have
formula_26

Similarly, the normal strain in the and becomes
formula_27

The engineering shear strain, or the change in angle between two originally orthogonal material lines, in this case line formula_28 and formula_29, is defined as
formula_30

From the geometry of Figure 1 we have
formula_31

For small rotations, i.e., formula_32 and formula_33 are formula_34 we have
formula_35
and, again, for small displacement gradients, we have
formula_36
thus
formula_37
By interchanging formula_23 and formula_39 and formula_40 and formula_41, it can be shown that formula_42.

Similarly, for the formula_39-formula_44 and formula_23-formula_44 planes, we have
formula_47

It can be seen that the tensorial shear strain components of the infinitesimal strain tensor can then be expressed using the engineering strain definition, as
formula_48

===Physical interpretation===
From finite strain theory we have
formula_49

For infinitesimal strains then we have
formula_50

Dividing by formula_51 we have
formula_52

For small deformations we assume that formula_53, thus the second term of the left hand side becomes: formula_54.

Then we have
formula_55
where formula_56, is the unit vector in the direction of formula_57, and the left-hand-side expression is the normal strain formula_58 in the direction of formula_59. For the particular case of formula_59 in the formula_61 direction, i.e., formula_62, we have
formula_63

Similarly, for formula_64 and formula_65 we can find the normal strains formula_66 and formula_67, respectively. Therefore, the diagonal elements of the infinitesimal strain tensor are the normal strains in the coordinate directions.

=== Strain transformation rules ===
If we choose an orthonormal coordinate system (formula_68) we can write the tensor in terms of components with respect to those base vectors as
formula_69
In matrix form,
formula_70
We can easily choose to use another orthonormal coordinate system (formula_71) instead. In that case the components of the tensor are different, say
formula_72
The components of the strain in the two coordinate systems are related by
formula_73
where the Einstein summation convention for repeated indices has been used and formula_74. In matrix form
formula_75
or
formula_76

=== Strain invariants ===
Certain operations on the strain tensor give the same result without regard to which orthonormal coordinate system is used to represent the components of strain. The results of these operations are called strain invariants. The most commonly used strain invariants are
formula_77
In terms of components
formula_78

===Principal strains===
It can be shown that it is possible to find a coordinate system (formula_79) in which the components of the strain tensor are
formula_80
The components of the strain tensor in the (formula_79) coordinate system are called the principal strains and the directions formula_82 are called the directions of principal strain. Since there are no shear strain components in this coordinate system, the principal strains represent the maximum and minimum stretches of an elemental volume.

If we are given the components of the strain tensor in an arbitrary orthonormal coordinate system, we can find the principal strains using an eigenvalue decomposition determined by solving the system of equations
formula_83
This system of equations is equivalent to finding the vector formula_82 along which the strain tensor becomes a pure stretch with no shear component.

===Volumetric strain===

The volumetric strain, also called bulk strain, is the relative variation of the volume, as arising from &quot;dilation&quot; or &quot;compression&quot;; it is the first strain invariant or trace of the tensor:
formula_85
Actually, if we consider a cube with an edge length &quot;a&quot;, it is a quasi-cube after the deformation (the variations of the angles do not change the volume) with the dimensions formula_86 and &quot;V&quot;0 = &quot;a&quot;3, thus
formula_87
as we consider small deformations,
formula_88
therefore the formula.

In case of pure shear, we can see that there is no change of the volume.

===Strain deviator tensor===
The infinitesimal strain tensor formula_10, similarly to the Cauchy stress tensor, can be expressed as the sum of two other tensors: 
# a mean strain tensor or volumetric strain tensor or spherical strain tensor, formula_90, related to dilation or volume change; and
# a deviatoric component called the strain deviator tensor, formula_91, related to distortion.

formula_92
where formula_93 is the mean strain given by
formula_94

The deviatoric strain tensor can be obtained by subtracting the mean strain tensor from the infinitesimal strain tensor:
formula_95

===Octahedral strains===
Let (formula_96) be the directions of the three principal strains. An octahedral plane is one whose normal makes equal angles with the three principal directions. The engineering shear strain on an octahedral plane is called the octahedral shear strain and is given by
formula_97
where formula_98 are the principal strains.

The normal strain on an octahedral plane is given by
formula_99
=== Equivalent strain ===
A scalar quantity called the equivalent strain, or the von Mises equivalent strain, is often used to describe the state of strain in solids. Several definitions of equivalent strain can be found in the literature. A definition that is commonly used in the literature on plasticity is
formula_100
This quantity is work conjugate to the equivalent stress defined as
formula_101

==Compatibility equations==

For prescribed strain components formula_10 the strain tensor equation formula_103 represents a system of six differential equations for the determination of three displacements components formula_104, giving an over-determined system. Thus, a solution does not generally exist for an arbitrary choice of strain components. Therefore, some restrictions, named &quot;compatibility equations&quot;, are imposed upon the strain components. With the addition of the three compatibility equations the number of independent equations are reduced to three, matching the number of unknown displacement components. These constraints on the strain tensor were discovered by Saint-Venant, and are called the &quot;Saint Venant compatibility equations&quot;.

The compatibility functions serve to assure a single-valued continuous displacement function formula_104. If the elastic medium is visualised as a set of infinitesimal cubes in the unstrained state, after the medium is strained, an arbitrary strain tensor may not yield a situation in which the distorted cubes still fit together without overlapping.

In index notation, the compatibility equations are expressed as

== Special cases ==

===Plane strain===

In real engineering components, stress (and strain) are 3-D tensors but in prismatic structures such as a long metal billet, the length of the structure is much greater than the other two dimensions. The strains associated with length, i.e., the normal strain formula_67 and the shear strains formula_114 and formula_115 (if the length is the 3-direction) are constrained by nearby material and are small compared to the &quot;cross-sectional strains&quot;. Plane strain is then an acceptable approximation. The strain tensor for plane strain is written as:
formula_116
in which the double underline indicates a second order tensor. This strain state is called &quot;plane strain&quot;. The corresponding stress tensor is:
formula_117
in which the non-zero formula_118 is needed to maintain the constraint formula_119. This stress term can be temporarily removed from the analysis to leave only the in-plane terms, effectively reducing the 3-D problem to a much simpler 2-D problem.

=== Antiplane strain ===

Antiplane strain is another special state of strain that can occur in a body, for instance in a region close to a screw dislocation. The strain tensor for antiplane strain is given by
formula_120

== Relation to infinitesimal rotation tensor ==
The infinitesimal strain tensor is defined as
formula_121
Therefore the displacement gradient can be expressed as
formula_122
where
formula_123
The quantity formula_124 is the infinitesimal rotation tensor or infinitesimal angular displacement tensor (related to the &quot;infinitesimal rotation matrix&quot;). This tensor is skew symmetric. For infinitesimal deformations the scalar components of formula_124 satisfy the condition formula_126. Note that the displacement gradient is small only if the strain tensor and the rotation tensor are infinitesimal.

=== The axial vector ===
A skew symmetric second-order tensor has three independent scalar components. These three components are used to define an axial vector, formula_127, as follows
formula_128
where formula_129 is the permutation symbol. In matrix form
formula_130
The axial vector is also called the infinitesimal rotation vector. The rotation vector is related to the displacement gradient by the relation
formula_131
In index notation
formula_132
If formula_133 and formula_134 then the material undergoes an approximate rigid body rotation of magnitude formula_135 around the vector formula_127.

=== Relation between the strain tensor and the rotation vector ===
Given a continuous, single-valued displacement field formula_137 and the corresponding infinitesimal strain tensor formula_138, we have (see Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics))
formula_139
Since a change in the order of differentiation does not change the result, formula_140. Therefore
formula_141
Also
formula_142
Hence
formula_143

=== Relation between rotation tensor and rotation vector ===
From an important identity regarding the curl of a tensor we know that for a continuous, single-valued displacement field formula_137,
formula_145
Since formula_146 we have
formula_147

== Strain tensor in non-Cartesian coordinates ==

=== Strain tensor in cylindrical coordinates ===
In cylindrical polar coordinates (formula_148), the displacement vector can be written as
formula_149
The components of the strain tensor in a cylindrical coordinate system are given by:
formula_150

=== Strain tensor in spherical coordinates ===

In spherical coordinates (formula_151), the displacement vector can be written as
formula_152
The components of the strain tensor in a spherical coordinate system are given by 
formula_153

<text>JBuilder is a discontinued integrated development environment (IDE) for the programming language Java from Embarcadero Technologies. Originally developed by Borland, JBuilder was spun off with CodeGear which was eventually purchased by Embarcadero Technologies in 2008.

Oracle had based the first versions of JDeveloper on code from JBuilder licensed from Borland, but it has since been rewritten from scratch.

==Versions==
JBuilder 1 through 3 are based on the Delphi IDE. JBuilder 3.5 through 2006 are based on PrimeTime, an all-Java IDE framework. JBuilder 2007 &quot;Peloton&quot; is the first JBuilder release based on the eclipse IDE framework.

<text>The Volvocaceae are a family of unicellular or colonial biflagellates, including the typical genus &quot;Volvox&quot;. The family was named by Ehrenberg in 1834, and is known in older classifications as the Volvocidae. All species are colonial and inhabit freshwater environments.

==Description==
The simplest of the Volvocaeans are ordered assemblies of cells, each similar to the related unicellular protist &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; and embedded in a gelatinous matrix. In the genus &quot;Gonium&quot;, for example, each individual organism is a flat plate consisting of 4 to 16 separate cells, each with two flagella. Similarly, the genera &quot;Eudorina&quot; and &quot;Pandorina&quot; form hollow spheres, the former consisting of 16 cells, the latter of 32 to 64 cells. In these genera each cell can reproduce a new organism by mitosis.
Other genera of Volvocaceans represent another principle of biological development as each organism develops differented cell types. In &quot;Pleodorina&quot; and &quot;Volvox&quot;, most cells are somatic and only a few are reproductive. In &quot;Pleodorina californica&quot; a colony normally has either 128 or 64 cells, of which those in the anterior region have only a somatic function, while those in the posterior region can reproduce; the ratio being 3:5. In &quot;Volvox&quot; only very few cells are able to reproduce new individuals, and in some species of &quot;Volvox&quot; the reproductive cells are derived from cells looking and behaving like somatic cells. In &quot;V. carteri&quot;, on the other hand, the division of labor is complete with reproductive cells being set aside during cell division, and they never assume somatic functions or develop functional flagella.

Thus, the simplest Volvocaceans are colonial organisms but others are truly multicellular organisms. Larger volvocaceans have evolved a specialized form of heterogamy called oogamy, the production of small motile sperm by one mating type and relatively larger immotile eggs by another. Among the Volvocaceans are thus the simplest organisms with distinguishable male and female members. In all Volvocaceans, the fertilization reaction results in the production of a dormant diploid zygote (zygospore) capable of surviving in harsh environments. Once conditions have improved the zygospore germinates and undergoes meiosis to produce haploid offspring of both mating types.

===Colony inversion===

Colony inversion during development is a special characteristic of this order that results in new colonies having their flagella facing outwards. During this process reproductive cells first undergo successive cell divisions to form a concave-to-cup-shaped embryo or plakea composed of a single cell layer. Immediately after, the cell layer is inside out compared with the adult configuration—the apical ends of the embryo protoplasts from which flagella are formed, are oriented toward the interior of the plakea. Then the embryo undergoes inversion, during which the cell layer inverts to form a spheroidal daughter colony with the apical ends and flagella of daughter protoplasts positioned outside. This process enables appropriate locomotion of spheroidal colonies of the Volvocaceae. The mechanism of inversion has been investigated extensively at the cellular and molecular levels using a model species, &quot;Volvox carteri&quot;.

Spheroidal colony inversion evolved twice during evolution of the Chlamydomonadales. In the Volvocaceae inversion first occurred when the Volvocaceae diverged from the closely related Goniaceae (see figure). It also occurred during evolution of Astrephomene. Inversion differs between the two lineages: rotation of daughter protoplasts during successive cell divisions in &quot;Astrephomene&quot;, and inversion after cell divisions in the Volvocaceae.

<text>Marie Jean Pierre Flourens (13 April 1794 – 6 December 1867), father of Gustave Flourens, was a French physiologist, the founder of experimental brain science, and a pioneer in anesthesia.

==Biography==
Flourens was born at Maureilhan, near Béziers, in the &quot;département&quot; of Hérault. At fifteen he began studying medicine at Montpellier, where he received the degree of doctor in 1813. In the following year he went to Paris, carrying an introduction from A. P. de Candolle, the botanist, to Georges Cuvier, who received him kindly, and took an interest in him. In Paris, Flourens engaged in physiological research, occasionally contributing to publications; and, in 1821, at the Athénée, he gave a course of lectures on the physiological theory of the , which attracted much attention amongst men of science.

In 1815, Flourens pioneered the experimental method of carrying out localized lesions of the brain in living rabbits and pigeons and carefully observing their effects on motricity, sensibility and behavior. His intention was to investigate localisationism, i.e., whether different parts of the brain had different functions, as the Austrian physician Franz Joseph Gall, the founder of phrenology, was proposing. The trouble was that Gall did not use a proper scientific approach to his affirmations. In 1825, Flourens was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Flourens was able to demonstrate convincingly for the first time that the main divisions of the brain were indeed responsible for largely different functions. By removing the cerebral hemispheres, for instance, all perceptions, motricity, and judgment were abolished. The removal of the cerebellum affected the animal&#x27;s equilibrium and motor coordination, while the destruction of the brainstem (medulla oblongata) caused death. These experiments led Flourens to the conclusion that the cerebral hemispheres are responsible for higher cognitive functions, that the cerebellum regulates and integrates movements, and that the medulla controls vital functions, such as circulation, respiration and general bodily stability. On the other hand, he was unable (probably because his experimental subjects have relatively primitive cortex) to find specific regions for memory and cognition, which led him to believe that they are represented in a diffuse form around the brain. So, different functions could indeed be ascribed to particular regions of the brain, but a finer localization was lacking.

Flourens, by destroying the horizontal semicircular canal of pigeons, noted that they continue to fly in a circle, showing the purpose of the semicircular canals.

Flourens was chosen by Cuvier in 1828 to deliver a course of lectures on natural history at the Collège de France, and in the same year became, in succession to LAG Bosc, a member of the Institute, in the division &quot;Economic rurale.&quot; In 1830 he became Cuvier&#x27;s substitute as lecturer on human anatomy at the Jardin du Roi, and in 1832 was elected to the post of titular professor, which he vacated for the professorship of comparative anatomy created for him at the museum of the Jardin the same year. In 1833 Flourens, in accordance with the dying request of Cuvier, was appointed a perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences; and in 1838 he was returned as a deputy for the &quot;arrondissement&quot; of Béziers. In 1840 he was elected, in preference to Victor Hugo, to succeed Jean François Michaud at the French Academy; and in 1845 he was created a commander of the &quot;légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, and in the next year a peer of France. In 1841, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In March 1847 Flourens drew the attention of the Academy of Sciences to the anesthetic effect of chloroform on animals.

On the revolution of 1848 he withdrew completely from political life; and in 1855 he accepted the professorship of natural history at the Collège de France. He died at Montgeron, near Paris on 6 December 1867.

==Opposition to Darwinism==

Flourens was an opponent of Darwinism and criticized the idea of natural selection. In 1864, he authored &quot;Examen du livre du M. Darwin sur l&#x27;Origine des Espèces&quot;. He refuted the arguments of spontaneous generation.

He was a creationist and defended the fixity of species. Flourens criticized Charles Darwin for personifying nature. He argued that natural selection is a contradictory term as nature does not select. Flourens&#x27; book was never translated into English and no reviewers attempted to refute his arguments in detail. However, Thomas Henry Huxley took issue with his criticism of Darwinism, noting that &quot;his objections to details are of the old sort, so battered and hackneyed on this side of the Channel, that not even a Quarterly Reviewer could be induced to pick them up for the purpose of pelting Mr. Darwin over again.&quot;

==Bibliography==
Besides numerous shorter scientific memoirs, Flourens published:

<text>Lucerne ( ) or Luzern () is a city in central Switzerland, in the German-speaking portion of the country. Lucerne is the capital of the canton of Lucerne and part of the district of the same name. With a population of approximately 82,000 people, Lucerne is the most populous city in Central Switzerland, and a nexus of economics, transport, culture, and media in the region. The city&#x27;s urban area consists of 19 municipalities and towns with an overall population of about 220,000 people.
Owing to its location on the shores of Lake Lucerne () and its outflow, the river Reuss, within sight of the mounts Pilatus and Rigi in the Swiss Alps, Lucerne has long been a destination for tourists. One of the city&#x27;s landmarks is the Chapel Bridge (), a wooden bridge first erected in the 14th century.

The official language of Lucerne is German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect, Lucerne German.

== History ==

=== Early history and founding (750–1386) ===
After the fall of the Roman Empire beginning in the 6th century, Germanic Alemannic peoples increased their influence on this area of present-day Switzerland.

Around 750 the Benedictine Monastery of St. Leodegar was founded, which was later acquired by Murbach Abbey in Alsace in the middle of the 9th century, and by this time the area had become known as .

The origin of the name is uncertain, it is possibly derived from the Latin name of the pike, , thus designating a pike fishing spot in the river Reuss. Derivation from the theonym &quot;Lugus&quot; has been suggested but is phonetically implausible. In any case, the name was associated by popular etymology with Latin &#x27;lantern&#x27; from an early time.

In 1178 Lucerne acquired its independence from the jurisdiction of Murbach Abbey, and the founding of the city proper probably occurred that same year. The city gained importance as a strategically located gateway for the growing commerce from the Gotthard trade route.

By 1290, Lucerne had become a self-sufficient city of reasonable size with about 3000 inhabitants. About this time King Rudolph I von Habsburg gained authority over the Monastery of St. Leodegar and its lands, including Lucerne. The populace was not content with the increasing Habsburg influence, and Lucerne allied with neighboring towns to seek independence from their rule. Along with Lucerne, the three other forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed the &quot;eternal&quot; Swiss Confederacy, known as the , on November 7, 1332.

Later the cities of Zürich, Zug and Bern joined the alliance. With the help of these additions, the rule of Austria over the area came to an end. The issue was settled by Lucerne&#x27;s victory over the Habsburgs in the Battle of Sempach in 1386. For Lucerne this victory ignited an era of expansion. The city shortly granted many rights to itself, rights which had been withheld by the Habsburgs until then. By this time the borders of Lucerne were approximately those of today.

=== From city to city-state (1386–1520) ===
In 1415 Lucerne gained from Emperor Sigismund and became a strong member of the Swiss confederacy. The city developed its infrastructure, raised taxes, and appointed its own local officials. The city&#x27;s population of 3000 dropped about 40% due to the Black Plague and several wars around 1350.

In 1419 town records show the first witch trial against a male person.

In 1471, the law was passed to persecute the Romani people of Indian origin.

=== Swiss-Catholic town (1520–1798) ===

Among the growing towns of the confederacy, Lucerne was especially popular in attracting new residents. Remaining predominantly Catholic, Lucerne hosted its own annual passion play from 1453 to 1616, a two-day-long play of 12 hours performance per day. As the confederacy broke up during the Reformation, after 1520, most nearby cities became Protestant, but Lucerne remained Catholic. After the victory of the Catholics over the Protestants in the Battle at Kappel in 1531, the Catholic towns dominated the confederacy. It was during this period that Jesuits first came to Lucerne in 1567, with their arrival given considerable backing by Cardinal Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. The region, though, was destined to be dominated by Protestant cities such as Zürich, Bern and Basel, which defeated the Catholic forces in the 1712 Toggenburg War. The former prominent position of Lucerne in the confederacy was lost forever. In the 16th and 17th centuries, wars and epidemics became steadily less frequent and as a result the population of the country increased strongly.

Lucerne was besieged by a peasant army and quickly signed a peace treaty with the rebels in the Swiss peasant war of 1653.

=== Century of revolutions (1798–1914) ===


In 1798, nine years after the beginning of the French Revolution, the French army marched into Switzerland. The Old Swiss Confederacy collapsed and the government became democratic. The Industrial Revolution hit Lucerne rather late, and by 1860 only 1.7% of the population worked in industry, which was about a quarter of the national average at that time. Agriculture, which employed about 40% of the workers, was the main form of economic output in the canton. Nevertheless, industry was attracted to the city from areas around Lucerne. From 1850 to 1913, the population quadrupled and the flow of settlers increased. In 1856 trains first linked the city to Olten and Basel, then Zug and Zürich in 1864 and finally to the south in 1897.

The 1804 play &quot;William Tell&quot; by Friedrich Schiller did much to establish the reputation of Lucerne and its environs. Schiller himself had not been to Lucerne, but was inspired to write the play by his wife Lotte and his friend Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who had both personally visited the city and its surrounding canton. Goethe had lodged in the Hirschenplatz on his route to Italy in 1779.

It was during the latter part of the 19th century that Lucerne became a popular destination for artists, royalty and others to escape to. The German composer Richard Wagner established a residence at Tribschen in 1866, where he lived and worked. The city was then boosted by a visit by Queen Victoria to the city in 1868, during which she went sightseeing at the Kapellbrücke and Lion Monument and relished speaking with local people in her native German.

The American writer Mark Twain further popularised the city and its environs in his travel writings after visiting twice, in 1878 and 1897. In 1892 Swiss poet and future Nobel laureate Carl Spitteler also established himself in Lucerne, living there until his death in 1924.

Lucerne&#x27;s status as a fashionable destination led to it becoming one of the first centres of modern-style tourism. Some of the city&#x27;s most recognisable buildings are hotels from this period, such as the Schweizerhof Hotel (1845), Grand Hotel National (1870), and Château Gütsch (1879). It was at the National that Swiss hotelier César Ritz would establish himself as manager between 1878 and 1888.

=== 1993 great fire ===

In August 1993, the Kapellbrücke in the centre of the city suffered from a great fire which destroyed two thirds of its interior paintings. The bridge was subsequently reconstructed and reopened to the public in April 1994, after a total of CHF 3.4 million was spent on its repair.

=== Merge with Littau ===
On June 17, 2007, voters of the city of Lucerne and the adjacent town of Littau agreed to a merger in a simultaneous referendum. This took effect on January 1, 2010. The new city, still called Lucerne, has a population of around 80,000 people, making it the seventh-largest city in Switzerland. The results of this referendum are expected to pave the way for negotiations with other nearby cities and towns in an effort to create a unified city-region, based on the results of a study.

==Geography and climate==
===Topography===
Lucerne is located at the outfall of Lake Lucerne into the river Reuss, which flows from south-east to north-west. The city occupies both banks of the river and the lowest reach of the lake, with the city centre straddling the river immediately downstream of the outfall. The city&#x27;s suburbs climb the hills to the north-east and south-west, and stretch out along the river and lake banks, whilst the recently added area of Littau is to the north-west.

Besides this contiguous city area, the municipality also includes an exclave on the south shore of Lake Lucerne some away, comprising the northern slopes of the Bürgenstock. This section of the municipality is entirely surrounded by the lake and by land of the canton of Nidwalden. It does not contain any significant settlements, but the summit of the Bürgenstock is the highest point of the municipality.

The municipality has an area of . Of this area and , 28.0% is used for agricultural purposes, while 22.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 47.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (2.1%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).

===Climate===
Between 1961 and 1990 Lucerne had an average of 138.1 days of rain per year and on average received of precipitation. The wettest month was June during which time Lucerne received an average of of rainfall. During this month there was rainfall for an average of 14.2 days. The driest month of the year was February with an average of of precipitation over 10.2 days. Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).

==Politics==
===Government===

The City Council (Stadtrat) constitutes the executive government of the city of Lucerne and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors (), each presiding over a directorate (&quot;Direktion&quot;) comprising several departments and bureaus. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (&quot;Stadtpräsident&quot;). In the mandate period (&quot;Legislatur&quot;) September 2020 – August 2024 the City Council is presided by &quot;Stadtpräsident&quot; Beat Züsli. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Grand City Council are carried by the City Council. The regular election of the City Council by any inhabitant valid to vote is held every four years. Any resident of Lucerne allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the City Council. The delegates are selected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor is elected as such as well by public election while the heads of the other directorates are assigned by the collegiate.

, Luzern&#x27;s City Council is made up of one representative of the SP (Social Democratic Party, who is also the mayor), and one each of CVP (Christian Democratic Party), GPS (Green Party), FDP (FDP.The Liberals), and glp (Green Liberal Party). The last regular election was held on 29 March/28 June 2020. All members have been re-elected, though two of them (Bitz Staub and Jost) only with the second round.


Michèle Bucher (FDP) is Town Chronicler (&quot;Stadtschreiberin&quot;) since 2020.

===Parliament===

The Grand City Council (Grosser Stadtrat) holds legislative power. It is made up of 48 members, with elections held every four years. The Grand City Council decrees regulations and by-laws that are executed by the City Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of proportional representation.

The sessions of the Grand City Council are public. Unlike members of the City Council, members of the Grand City Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Luzern allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Grand City Council. The parliament holds its meetings in the &quot;Rathaus&quot; (Town Hall) am Kornmarkt.

The last regular election of the Grand City Council was held on 29 March 2020 for the mandate period () from September 2020 to August 2024.

Suva, one of Switzerland&#x27;s oldest accident insurance companies, is also based in Lucerne, as is the University of Lucerne, the youngest of Switzerland&#x27;s traditional universities. An international company is the EF Education First.

Thanks to its continuous tax-cutting policies, Lucerne has become Switzerland&#x27;s most business-friendly canton. Lucerne offers Switzerland&#x27;s lowest corporate tax rate at cantonal level.

Furthermore, Lucerne also offers very moderate personal income tax rates. In a recent published study of BAK Basel Economics taxation index 2012, Lucerne made it to the 4th place with an only marginally 2% higher tax rate compared to the top canton in this comparison.

One of the first export oriented branches was the production of scythes from the 14th century onwards. Lucerne imported iron and steel and the cities blacksmiths produced scythes which were exported to western Switzerland and northern Italy. The workshops of the blacksmiths were located in the outskirts of the city due to fire concerns. The workshops at the Krienbach creek included hammers moved by watermills.

==Sights==

Since the city straddles the Reuss where it drains the lake, it has a number of bridges. These include the Chapel Bridge (&quot;Kapellbrücke&quot;), a long wooden covered bridge originally built in 1333, the oldest covered bridge in Europe, although much of it had to be replaced after a fire on 18 August 1993, allegedly caused by a discarded cigarette. Partway across, the bridge runs by the octagonal Water Tower (&quot;Wasserturm&quot;), a fortification from the 13th century. Inside the bridge are a series of paintings from the 17th century depicting events from Lucerne&#x27;s history.
Downriver, between the Kasernenplatz and the Mühlenplatz, the Spreuer Bridge (&quot;Spreuerbrücke&quot; or &quot;Mühlenbrücke&quot;, Mill Bridge) zigzags across the Reuss. Constructed in 1408, it features a series of medieval-style 17th century plague paintings by Kaspar Meglinger (de) titled &quot;Dance of Death&quot; (&quot;Totentanzzyklus&quot;). The bridge has a small chapel in the middle that was added in 1568.

Old Town Lucerne is mainly located just north of the Reuss, and still has several fine half-timber structures with painted fronts. Remnants of the old town walls exist on the hill above Lucerne, complete with eight tall watch towers. An additional gated tower sits at the base of the hill on the banks of the Reuss.

The twin needle towers of the Church of St. Leodegar, which was named after the city&#x27;s patron saint, sit on a small hill just above the lake front. Originally built in 735, the present structure was erected in 1633 in the late Renaissance style. However, the towers are surviving remnants of an earlier structure. The interior is richly decorated. The church is popularly called the &quot;Hofkirche&quot; (in German) and is known locally as the &quot;Hofchile&quot; (in Swiss-German).

Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s carving of a dying lion (the &quot;Lion Monument&quot;, or &quot;Löwendenkmal&quot;) is found in a small park just off the Löwenplatz. The carving commemorates the hundreds of Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution, when an armed mob stormed the Tuileries Palace in Paris.

The Swiss Museum of Transport is a large and comprehensive museum exhibiting all forms of transport, including locomotives, automobiles, ships, and aircraft. It is to be found beside the lake in the northern-eastern section of the city.

The Culture and Convention Center (KKL) beside the lake in the center of the city was designed by Jean Nouvel. The center has one of the world&#x27;s leading concert halls, with acoustics by Russell Johnson.

The Richard Wagner Museum is found on the lake at Tribschen and is dedicated to the composer Richard Wagner. Wagner lived in Lucerne from 1866 to 1872 and his former villa now hosts the museum dedicated to him.

===Culture===

Since plans for the new culture and convention centre arose in the late 1980s, Lucerne has found a balance between the so-called established culture and alternative culture. A consensus was reached that culminated in a culture compromise (Kulturkompromiss). The established culture comprises the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre (KKL), the city theater (Luzerner Theater) and, in a broader sense, smaller establishments such as the Kleintheater, founded by comedian Emil Steinberger, a Lucerne native, or Stadtkeller, a music restaurant in the city&#x27;s old town. KKL houses a concert hall as well as the Museum of Art Lucerne (Kunstmuseum Luzern).

Alternative culture took place mostly on the premises of a former tube factory, which became known as Boa. Other localities for alternative culture have since emerged in the same inner city area as Boa. Initially, Boa staged various plays, but concerts became more and more common; this new use of the building clashed with the development of apartment buildings on nearby lots of land. Due to possible noise pollution, Boa was closed and a replacement in a less heavily inhabited area is currently under construction. Critics claimed though that the new establishment would not meet the requirements for an alternative culture.

Südpol is a center for performing arts in Lucerne presenting music-, dance- and theatre-events. The house at the foot of Pilatus opened in November 2008.

Lucerne is home to the Luzerner Sinfonieorchester, a category A symphonic orchestra, and to the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra, and they both hold most of their performances in the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre.

Lucerne is also home to Keramikkonzerte, a series of classical chamber music concerts held throughout each year, as well as Zaubersee, a festival dedicated to Russian classical music.

On November 27, 2024 faith leaders from the Catholic Church of the City of Lucerne and researchers from the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts jointly released a report detailing findings from the experimental &quot;Deus in Machina&quot; exhibit that ran for two months. The exhibit&#x27;s purpose was to explore the intersection between faith and artificial intelligence (AI). The exhibit was found in a confessional booth within the Peter&#x27;s chapel of the historic St. Peters-Kapelle, an 18th-century church. The exhibit consisted of an avatar Jesus who would have faith-based discussions with people via the use of Open AI&#x27;s large language model, GPT-4o. The report details findings from a total of 900 conversations that visitors to the chapel had with the exhibit, and subsequent exit surveys. The exhibit attracted reverent individuals of all kinds of faith communities from Catholics to Buddhists. The project was led by the chapel&#x27;s theologian, Marco Schmid. The public&#x27;s reception of the exhibit was quite varied with praises from some and accusations of blasphemy by others.

===Events===

Every year, towards the end of winter, &quot;Fasnacht&quot; (Carnival) breaks out in the streets, alleyways and squares of the old town. This is a glittering outdoor party, where chaos and merriness reign, and nothing is as it normally is. Strange characters in fantastic masks and costumes make their way through the alleyways, while &quot;Guggenmusiken&quot; (carnival bands) blow their instruments in joyful cacophony and thousands of bizarrely clad people sing and dance away the winter. , based on religious, Catholic backgrounds, starts every year on the Thursday before &quot;Aschermittwoch&quot; (Ash Wednesday) at 5 am with a detonation called &quot;Urknall&quot; (Big Bang), the signal to begin the &quot;Tagwache&quot; (wake-up procession). There are big parades in the afternoon on &quot;Schmotzige Donnerstag&quot; (literally: Lardy Thursday) and the following Monday, called &quot;Güdismontag&quot; (literally: Paunch Monday), which attract tens of thousands of people. Lucerne&#x27;s Carnival ends with a crowning finish on &quot;Güdisdienstag&quot; (literally: Paunch Tuesday) evening with the &quot;Monstercorso&quot;, a tremendous parade of &quot;Guggenmusiken&quot;, lights and lanterns with even a larger audience. Rather recently a fourth Fasnacht day has been introduced on the Saturday between the other Fasnacht days, the &quot;Rüüdige Samstag&quot; while mainly several indoor balls take place. From dusk till dawn on the evenings of &quot;Schmotzige Donnerstag&quot;, &quot;Güdismontag&quot;, and after the &quot;Monstercorso&quot; many bands wander through the historical part of the city playing typical Fasnacht tunes. Until midnight, the historical part of the city usually is packed with people participating. A large part of the audience are also dressed up in costumes, even a majority in the evenings.

The city hosts various renowned festivals throughout the year. The Lucerne Festival for classical music takes place in the summer. Its orchestra, the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, is hand-picked from some of the finest instrumentalists in the world. In June yearly the pop music festival B-Sides takes place in Lucerne. It focuses on international acts in alternative music, indie rock, experimental rock and other cutting edge and left field artistic musical genres. In July, the Blue Balls Festival brings jazz, blues and punk music to the lake promenade and halls of the Culture and Convention Center. The Lucerne Blues Festival is another musical festival which usually takes place in November. Since spring 2004, Lucerne has hosted the Festival Rose d&#x27;Or for television entertainment. And in April, the well-established comics festival &quot;Fumetto&quot; attracts an international audience.

Being the cultural center of a rather rural region, Lucerne regularly holds different folklore festivals, such as Lucerne Cheese Festival, held annually. In 2004, Lucerne was the focus of Swiss Wrestling fans when it had hosted the Swiss Wrestling and Alpine festival (&quot;Eidgenössisches Schwing- und Älplerfest&quot;), which takes place every three years in a different location. A national music festival (&quot;Eidgenössiches Musikfest&quot;) attracted marching bands from all parts of Switzerland in 2006. In summer 2008, the yodelling festival (&quot;Eidgenössisches Jodlerfest&quot;) had a similar impact.

The 2021 Winter Universiade was planned to be hosted by Lucerne, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Transport==
After Ferdinand von Zeppelin landed his airship in Lucerne in 1909, the city became a pioneer for the aeronautical industry in Switzerland. In February 1910 the countries first (and after the DELAG of Germany the second in the world) air transport company was founded, in July the same year then also the first airship hangar at Tribschenmoos. The company provided flights with airships until 1914 without notable accidents.

Lucerne boasts a developed and well-run transport network, with the main operator, Verkehrsbetriebe Luzern (VBL), running both the trolleybuses in Lucerne and a motor buses network in the city and to neighboring municipalities.

There are 40 trains per day between Lucerne and Zürich, with an average travel time of 48 minutes. Zurich Airport can be reached in just over an hour. Adjacent to the station is Luzern Bahnhofquai, from which ships of the Lake Lucerne Navigation Company operate to various destinations on Lake Lucerne. Between April and mid October, the tourist oriented Gotthard Panorama Express connects Lucerne with Lugano once a day by boat and train, travelling by boat along the length of Lake Lucerne and then by train over the historic high-level Gotthard route.

Three other railway stations are located within the city boundaries, with close to the Swissporarena in the south of the city, in the former municipality of Littau and the adjacent to the Swiss Museum of Transport in the east.

Lucerne&#x27;s city transit system is fully integrated into the coherent and integrated fare network system called passepartout encompassing all kind of public transport in the cantons of Lucerne, Obwalden, and Nidwalden.

A funicular, Gütschbahn, links the city to Château Gütsch, 90 m above. Standseilbahn Hotel Montana runs from the lakefront to Hotel Montana. From 1912 to 1978, there was Dietschibergbahn at Dietschiberg.

In the past, Lucerne also produced national successes in men&#x27;s handball and women&#x27;s volleyball and softball.

Having a long tradition of equestrian sports, Lucerne has co-hosted CSIO Switzerland, an international equestrian show jumping event, until it left entirely for St. Gallen in 2006. Since then, the Lucerne Equestrian Masters replaced it. There is also an annual horse racing event, usually taking place in August.

Lucerne annually hosts the final leg of the World Rowing Cup on Rotsee Lake. Numerous World Rowing Championships have been held in Lucerne including the inaugural World Championships of 1962 and then the regattas of 1974, 1982 and 2001.

<text>Chlamydomonadales, also known as Volvocales, are an order of flagellated or pseudociliated green algae, specifically of the Chlorophyceae. Chlamydomonadales can form planar or spherical colonies. These vary from &quot;Gonium&quot; (four to 32 cells) up to &quot;Volvox&quot; (500 cells or more). Each cell has two flagella, and is similar in appearance to &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot;, with the flagella throughout the colony moving in coordination.

Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur. In the former, cells divide until they form new colonies, which are then released. In the smaller forms, typically all cells are involved, but larger forms have anterior vegetative and posterior reproductive cells. Sexual reproduction varies from isogamy (both genders produce flagellated gametes of equal size) to oogamy (one gender produces a much larger, nonmotile gamete).

The classification of the Chlamydomonadales varies. Very often they are taken to include the orders Volvocales and Dunallielales, which contain closely related unicellular flagellates, as suborders. Colony inversion is believed to have arisen twice in this order. Spheroidal colony formation differs between the two lineages: rotation of daughter protoplasts during successive cell divisions in Astrephomene, and inversion after cell divisions in the Volvocaceae.

==Phylogeny==
Traditionally, families and genera within Chlamydomonadales have been classified based on their morphology. However, molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the evolutionary relationships do not correspond to the traditional taxonomic classifications. Despite this, the families and genera are still in use, because the differences have not been reconciled into a single, useful classification system.

In 2008, Nakada &quot;et al.&quot; defined a number of well-supported clades within Chlamydomonadales using &quot;PhyloCode&quot;. Their relationships, as well as a few representative genera and species, are shown below.

<text>Fynbos (; , ) is a small belt of natural shrubland or heathland vegetation located in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. The area is predominantly coastal and mountainous, with a Mediterranean climate. The fynbos ecoregion is within the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. In fields related to biogeography, fynbos is known for its exceptional degree of biodiversity and endemism, consisting of about 80% (8,500 fynbos) species of the Cape floral kingdom, where nearly 6,000 of them are endemic. The area continues to face severe human-caused threats, but due to the many economic uses of the fynbos, conservation efforts are being made to help restore it.

==Origin of the term==
The word &quot;&quot; is often taken literally to mean &quot;fine bush&quot;, as in Afrikaans &quot;&quot; means &quot;bush&quot;, whereas in this instance &quot;bush&quot; refers to the type of vegetation. Typical fynbos foliage is ericoid rather than &quot;fine&quot;. The term in its pre-Afrikaans, Dutch form, &quot;&quot;, was recorded by Noble as being in casual use in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, John Bews referred to: &quot;South-Western or Cape Region of Macchia or Fynbosch&quot;. He said: &quot;In this well-known region where the rain occurs in winter and the summers are more or less dry, the dominant vegetation is of a sclerophyllous type and there is little or no natural grassland, though there are many kinds of grass...&quot; He also refers to a high degree of endemism in the grasses in that region. Elsewhere he speaks of the term as &quot;...applied by the inhabitants of the Cape to any sort of small woodland growth that does not include timber trees&quot;; in the current vernacular, this still is the effective sense of the word. However, in the technical, ecological sense, the constraints are more demanding. In the latter half of the 20th century, &quot;fynbos&quot; gained currency as the term for the &quot;distinctive vegetation of the southwestern Cape&quot;.

==Cape Floral Kingdom==
Fynbos – which grows in a 100-to-200-km-wide coastal belt stretching from Clanwilliam on the West coast to Port Elizabeth on the Southeast coast – forms part of the Cape floral kingdom, where it accounts for half of the surface area and 80% of the plant species. The fynbos in the western regions is richer and more varied than in the eastern regions of South Africa.

Of the world&#x27;s six floral kingdoms, this is the smallest and richest per unit of area. The Holarctic kingdom, in contrast, incorporates the whole of the Northern Hemisphere north of the tropics. The diversity of fynbos plants is extremely high, with over 9,000 species of plants occurring in the area, around 6,200 of which are endemic, i.e. growing nowhere else in the world. South Africa&#x27;s Western Cape has the vast majority of species with one estimate finding 8,550 species in 89,000 km2, which is higher than that estimated for the Malayan forests, 7,900 species in 132,000 km2. It has been claimed that it exceeds even the richest tropical rainforest in South America, including the Amazon. Of the &quot;Ericas&quot;, over 600 occur in the fynbos kingdom, while only two or three dozen have been described in the rest of the world. This is in an area of 46,000 km2 – by comparison, the Netherlands, with an area of 33,000 km2, has 1,400 species, none of them endemic. Table Mountain in Cape Town supports 2,200 species, more than the entire United Kingdom. Thus, although the fynbos covers only 6% of the area of southern Africa, it has half the species on the subcontinent – and in fact has almost one in five of all African plant species so far described.

Five main river systems traverse the Cape floral kingdom: the Oliphants River of the Western Cape; the Berg River which drains the West Coast Forelands plain stretching from the Cape Flats to the Olifants; the Breede, which is the largest river on the Cape; the Olifants River (Southern Cape); Gourits and the Groot Rivers which drain the Little Karoo basin and the South Coast Forelands; and the Baviaanskloof and Gamtoos Rivers to the east.

==Flora==
The most conspicuous components of the flora are evergreen sclerophyllous plants, many with ericoid leaves and gracile habit, as opposed to timber forest. Several plant families are conspicuous in fynbos; the Proteaceae are prominent, with genera such as &quot;Protea&quot;, &quot;Leucospermum&quot; (the &quot;pincushions&quot;), and &quot;Leucadendron&quot; (the silver tree and &quot;cone bushes&quot;). Proteas are represented by many species and are prominent in the landscape, generally with large striking flowers, many of which are pollinated by birds, and others by small mammals. Most of these do not have anything like ericoid leaves, and nor do most Rhamnaceae, Fabaceae, or Geraniaceae. Fynbos Ericaceae include more species of &quot;Erica&quot; than all other regions combined. They are popularly called heaths and are generally smaller plants bearing many small, tubular or globular flowers and ericoid leaves. Restionaceae also occur in greater variety in fynbos than anywhere else; their species are superficially grass-like. Many of them grow in wet areas such as seasonal marshes and spongy basins in the sources of mountain streams, but others grow in decidedly arid conditions.

Depending on the locality and the aspects under discussion, several other families have equal claim to being characteristic, including Asteraceae, Rutaceae, and Iridaceae. More than 1400 bulb species occur among the fynbos, of which 96 are &quot;Gladiolus&quot; and 54 &quot;Lachenalia&quot;. Areas that are dominated by &quot;renosterbos&quot;, &quot;Dicerothamnus rhinocerotis&quot;, (Asteraceae) are known as Renosterveld (Afrikaans for &quot;rhinoceros field&quot;).

==Fauna==
The fynbos is home to many unique and endemic animals, with seven species of endemic bird and an unknown number of endemic reptiles, amphibians, and arthropods. The seven avian endemics include the Cape rockjumper, Cape sugarbird, Victorin&#x27;s warbler, Orange-breasted sunbird, Protea canary, Cape siskin, and Fynbos buttonquail.

==Ecoregions==
The fynbos area has been divided into two very similar ecoregions: the lowland fynbos (below 300 m above sea level) on the sandy soil of the west coast, and the montane fynbos of the Cape Fold Belt.

The Lowland Fynbos and Renosterveld experiences regular winter rainfall, especially to the west of Cape Agulhas. The ecoregion has been subdivided into nine areas: the West Coast Forelands from the Cape Flats to the Olifants River (Western Cape); the Warm Bokkeveld basin around the town of Ceres; the Elgin Valley around the town of Elgin; the sandy Agulhas Plain on the coast; the Breede River valley around the town of Worcester; the South Coast Forelands from Caledon west to Mossel Bay; the south-eastern end of the Little Karoo; Langkloof valley; and the Southeastern Coast Forelands west from Tsitsikamma to Gqeberha.

The flora of the lowlands contains a high number of endemic species, and tends to favour larger plants than those growing on the hillier areas. They include the larger Restionaceae such as species of &quot;Elegia&quot;, &quot;Thamnochortus&quot;, and &quot;Willdenowia&quot; and proteas such as king protea (&quot;Protea cynaroides&quot;) and blushing bride (&quot;Serruria florida&quot;). Particular types of lowland fynbos include the shrubs and herbs of the coastal sand dunes, the mixture of ericoids and restoids with thickets of shrubs such as &quot;Maytenus&quot;, and other Celastraceae, sideroxylons and other Sapotaceae, and &quot;Rhus&quot; and other Anacardiaceae on the coastal sands; the classic fynbos of the sandplains of the West Coast Forelands, and the Agulhas Plain; the grassy fynbos of the hillier and wetter areas of the South and South-Eastern Coast Forelands; areas where fynbos and renosterveld are mixed; coastal renosterveld on the West and South Coast Forelands; and the inland renosterveld of the drier inland Little Karoo and Warm Bokkeveld.

The area is also home to a large number of endemic creatures that have adapted to life in this area, such as the monkey beetles which pollinate &quot;Ixia viridiflora&quot;. Endemic species of fish in the five river systems occur in the area, too. Endemic reptiles and amphibians include a number of tortoises and the chameleon-like arum frog (&quot;Hyperolius horstockii&quot;).

The Montane Fynbos and Renosterveld is the area above , a total of of the Cape Fold Mountains. The same level of floral variety, including all three characteristic fynbos families, is found there, but ericas predominate. Because the higher and wetter areas are more protected and contain important water sources, the original flora is more intact than in the lowlands; but agriculture and global warming are still threats. The region includes the mountains in the west from the Cape Peninsula to the Kouebokkeveld Mountains, the south coast hinterland from Elgin to Gqeberha, the mountains north of the Little Karoo from Laingsburg to Willowmore, and the inselberg hills within the Little Karoo. About half of these areas are originally fynbos, and about half are renosterveld.

Many different microclimates occur, so the flora changes from west to east, and also varies with altitude up the hillsides away from the coast and according to compass direction. Lower elevations are covered with protea fynbos, with ericas taking over further up. Plant species include pincushions (&quot;Leucospermum&quot;). The wildlife includes a number of endemic bees, beetles, horseflies, and ants, and birds such as Cape sugarbirds and the orange-breasted sunbird. Many of these birds and insects are important and specific pollinators for the fynbos, such as the mountain pride butterfly (&quot;Aeropetes tulbaghia&quot;) which only visits red flowers such as &quot;Disa uniflora&quot; and pollinates 15 different species. Larger animals include antelopes, particularly Cape grysbok (&quot;Raphicerus melanotis&quot;), common duiker (&quot;Sylvicapra grimmia&quot;), and klipspringer (&quot;Oreotragus oreotragus&quot;). The extinct blue antelope and quagga were also fynbos natives.

==Economic uses==
Rooibos (&quot;Aspalathus linearis&quot;) and honeybush (&quot;Cyclopia intermedia&quot;) are of economic importance, grown and harvested in large quantities in the Cederberg area, and providing important exports. Restios continue to be used for thatching, as they have for hundreds or even thousands of years. Proteas and other floral species are grown in many areas and their flowers harvested for export.

In many areas with Mediterranean climates, fynbos species have become popular garden plants, in particular aloes and geraniums, and in cooler regions are used as window plants.

A very large number of fynbos plant species are used in traditional medicine, and while only a tiny proportion have as yet been subjected to formal testing, many have already been identified as having medicinal properties.

==Threats and conservation==
The fynbos is the region of South Africa most affected by invasive alien species which collectively cover around 10% of the entire country. The most common invasive plants are wattles and hakeas, native to Australia, and pines native to Europe and the Californian coast of the United States. Pines had been introduced to South Africa by the 19th century and the wattles were imported into the mid-1870s to stabilize sand dunes. In 1997 it was estimated that invasion caused the fynbos region to decline in value by US$750 million per year.

The Working for Water (WfW) program was started in 1995 by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to control these invasive species which were shown to sequester 9.95% of usable surface water runoff. Since then, over 100,000 hectares of land have been cleared of invasive species while providing jobs to around 20,000 people per year, most of which are women and unskilled workers. Systematic monitoring of WfW&#x27;s progress is lacking but there is anecdotal evidence that endemic silver peas have returned to Table Mountain after being thought extinct.

<text>Pierre-Joseph Cambon (, 10 June 1756 – 15 February 1820) was a French statesman. He is perhaps best known for speaking up against Maximilien Robespierre at the National Convention, sparking the end of Robespierre&#x27;s reign.

Born in Montpellier, Cambon was the son of a wealthy cotton merchant. In 1785, his father retired, leaving Pierre and his two brothers to run the business, but in 1788 Pierre entered politics, and was sent by his fellow-citizens as deputy suppliant to the Estates-General, where he was mostly a spectator. In January 1790 he returned to Montpellier, was elected a member of the municipality, co-founded the Jacobin Club in that city, and on the flight to Varennes of King Louis XVI in 1791, he drew up a petition to invite the National Constituent Assembly to proclaim a Republic —the first in date of such petitions.

Elected to the Legislative Assembly, Cambon was viewed as independent, honest, and talented in the financial domain. He was the most active member of the committee of finance and was often charged to verify the state of the treasury. His analytical skills were recorded in his remarkable speech of 24 November 1791.

It was Cambon who made the initial suggestion for the state debt to be &quot;rendered republican and uniform&quot; and it was he who proposed to convert all the contracts of the creditors of the state into an inscription in a great book, which should be called the &quot;Great Book of the Public Debt&quot;. This proposal was implemented in 1792 when the Great Book of the Public Debt was created as a consolidation of all the states debts.

He held his distance from political clubs and even factions, but nonetheless defended the new institutions of the state. On 9 February 1792, he succeeded in having a law passed confiscating the possessions of the &quot;émigrés&quot;, and tried to arrange the deportation of non-juring priests to French Guiana. He was the last president of the Legislative Assembly.

Re-elected to the National Convention, Cambon opposed the pretensions of the Paris Commune and the proposed grant of money to the municipality of Paris by the state. On 15 December 1792, he persuaded the convention to adopt a proclamation to all nations in favour of a universal republic. In the year after he denounced Jean-Paul Marat&#x27;s placards as inciting to murder, summoned Georges Danton to give an account of his ministry, supervised the furnishing of military supplies to the French Revolutionary Army, and was a strong opponent of Charles François Dumouriez, in spite of the general&#x27;s great popularity.

Cambon incurred the hatred of the theist Maximilien Robespierre (see Cult of the Supreme Being) by proposing the suppression of the pay to the clergy, which would have meant the separation of church and state. His authority grew steadily.

Although he took part in toppling Robespierre in July 1794, Cambon was targeted and pursued by the Thermidorian Reaction, and had to live in hiding in Montpellier. During the Hundred Days, he was a deputy to the lower chamber, but only took part in debates over the budget. Proscribed by the Bourbon Restoration in 1816, he died at Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, near Brussels.

<doc id="184025" wikidata="Q571923" url="?curid=184025" title="Ancistrus">
<text>Ancistrus is a genus of nocturnal freshwater fish in the family Loricariidae of order Siluriformes, native to freshwater habitats in South America and Panama. Fish of this genus are common in the aquarium trade where they are known as bushynose or bristlenose catfish. In the aquarium hobby they are often referred to as bushynose or bristlenose plecos instead, but this may lead to confusion as &quot;pleco&quot; usually is used for &quot;Hypostomus plecostomus&quot; and its allies and is often used as a catchall term for any loricariids remotely resembling that species.

==Taxonomy==
The type species is &quot;Ancistrus cirrhosus&quot;. This genus is the largest genus within the tribe Ancistrini.

The name ancistrus derives from the Ancient Greek &quot;agkistron&quot; &quot;hook&quot; – a reference to the form of the cheek odontodes. The genera &quot;Pristiancistrus&quot;, &quot;Thysanocara&quot; and &quot;Xenocara&quot; are now synonyms of &quot;Ancistrus&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Ancistrus&quot; species show all the typical features of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth. The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head. &quot;Tentacules&quot;, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species. Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout. In comparison with a typical loricariid (pleco), a bristlenose is typically shorter (4–6 inches or 15 cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common. In contrast to many other loricariid &#x27;plecos&#x27; (many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity), the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks, contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby.

&quot;Ancistrus&quot; species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an X0 sex-determination system, which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Ancistrus&quot; is one of the widest ranging Loricariid genera, and representatives are found in most areas where the family in general is present. Many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the Amazon basin, but there are also species elsewhere in tropical South America, as well as species on the island of Trinidad and two species, &quot;A. centrolepis&quot; and &quot;A. chagresi&quot; in Panama. Three species are true cavefish (troglobites): &quot;A. cryptophthalmus&quot;, &quot;A. galani&quot; and &quot;A. formoso&quot;. These are the only known loricariids that possess adaptions for a subterranean lifestyle, such as reduced pigmentation (appearing overall whitish) and eyes.

==Aquarium maintenance==
In the wild, &quot;Ancistrus&quot; species prefer flowing water, so tanks with flow are typically used when keeping them in captivity. Since they are bottom-dwelling fish, substrate is considered preferable to a bare tank floor. Mixtures of gravel, dirt, and clay are frequently used as substrate for &quot;Ancistrus&quot;. 

The aquarium size that is considered by some to be a minimum for fish of this genus is 25 gallons.

==Species==
There are currently 76 recognized species in this genus:
==Ecology==

The diet of this genus is typical for a Loricariid – algae, aufwuchs, and detritus, with sediment, sand, and gravel presumably ingested accidentally alongside food items. Despite reports among fish-keepers that they require wood in their diet, no scientific evidence to date supports members of this genus feeding on wood. Bristlenoses do not school but hide when not feeding, juveniles however are typically found in brightly lit shallows at the water margin making them susceptible to predation by birds.

&quot;Ancistrus&quot; species have the capability of obtaining oxygen through their modified stomach. This allows them to survive in conditions with low oxygen levels.

Breeding takes place in hollows, caves and mud holes in banks. Males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest. Courtship includes expanding the dorsal and caudal fins and attempts by the male to escort the female to the nest. While the female inspects the nest, the male keeps close contact. The female may lay 20–200 adhesive eggs, usually to the ceiling of the cavity.

The female plays no role in parental care; the male takes care of its young. Males will clean the eggs and the cavity with its fins and mouth. Males inspect eggs to remove diseased or infertile eggs, and aerates the clutch by fanning them with its pectoral and pelvic fins. During this time, a male usually will not leave the cavity to feed, or will leave only occasionally and quickly return. The eggs hatch in 4–10 days over a period of 2–6 hours; the male guards the eggs for 7–10 days after hatching. The fry remain in the cave, attaching to the walls and ceiling with their mouths, absorbing their yolk sac in 2–4 days and becoming free swimming.

Males of these species are competitive and territorial. Males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other, head to tail, with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted. If this escalates to combat, the males will circle each other and direct attacks at the head. If an intruding male manages to evict another male from the nest, it may cannibalize the other male&#x27;s young.

A male bristlenose may guard several clutches of eggs simultaneously. Females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females, which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs. Several clutches in various states of development from eggs to free-swimming larvae can be found in one nest.

==In the aquarium==

These fish are often kept by aquarists, as they are dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in pet shops. They reach up to in males, and in females. Their recommended temperature is . Their lifespan is up to 12 years. They are hardy animals, tolerant to a wide range of water conditions. They breed easily in captivity, and are compatible with most other freshwater fish. Though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color, other species are more exotic – spots of bright yellow on a dark background being a common pattern. Albino variants are also common. The albino morph is not caused by exposure to light during development, it is a morph controlled by genetics.

Historically, commonly available species of &quot;Ancistrus&quot; were &quot;Ancistrus cirrhosus&quot; and &quot;Ancistrus temminckii&quot;; other species are now available, though exact identification is difficult.

Feeding is easy, bristlenoses will graze on algae/ algae wafers and other surface growing organisms as well as eating algae wafers or tablets, flake food, squash, spinach, cucumber, zucchini, green beans peas and even sliced carrots. They have also been known to accept frozen bloodworms as part of their diet. Aquarium specimens may starve for lack of algae or other plant matter; algae wafers or other low-protein foods are recommended. Keepers should watch for the abdomen to take on a sunken appearance, indicating insufficient nutrition.

Sexing is very easy as the female will only occasionally have bristles, around the edge of the chin, whereas the male will have them up the center of the head.

Breeding is also possible. Males attract females to a small cave or hollow, then guard eggs after fertilization through hatching (4–8 days) until fry are free swimming (4–6 days after hatching); the aquarist need only supply a suitable cave, food, and one of each sex.

Caution should be taken with the spines (odontodes); although the risk of personal injury is small with this genus, the hooked nature of the odontodes means that a bristlenose may become trapped in non-natural material such as sponge filters and netting.

<doc id="184030" wikidata="Q505466" url="?curid=184030" title="Idries Shah">
<text>Idries Shah (; , , ; 16 June 1924 – 23 November 1996), also known as Idris Shah, Indries Shah, né [[Sayyid|Sayed]] Idries el-[[Hashemite|Hashimi]] (Arabic: ) and by the pen name Arkon Daraul, was an Afghan author, thinker and teacher in the Sufi tradition. Shah wrote over three dozen books on topics ranging from psychology and spirituality to travelogues and culture studies.

Born in British India, the descendant of a family of Afghan nobles on his father&#x27;s side and a Scottish mother, Shah grew up mainly in England. His early writings centred on magic and witchcraft. In 1960 he established a publishing house, Octagon Press, producing translations of Sufi classics as well as titles of his own. His seminal work was &quot;The Sufis&quot;, which appeared in 1964 and was well received internationally. In 1965, Shah founded the Institute for Cultural Research, a London-based educational charity devoted to the study of human behaviour and culture. A similar organisation, the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK), was established in the United States under the directorship of Stanford University psychology professor Robert Ornstein, whom Shah appointed as his deputy in the U.S.

In his writings, Shah presented Sufism as a universal form of wisdom that predated Islam. Emphasizing that Sufism was not static but always adapted itself to the current time, place and people, he framed his teaching in Western psychological terms. Shah made extensive use of traditional teaching stories and parables, texts that contained multiple layers of meaning designed to trigger insight and self-reflection in the reader. He is perhaps best known for his collections of humorous Mulla Nasrudin stories.

Shah was at times criticized by orientalists who questioned his credentials and background. His role in the controversy surrounding a new translation of the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;, published by his friend Robert Graves and his older brother Omar Ali-Shah, came in for particular scrutiny. However, he also had many notable defenders, chief among them the novelist Doris Lessing. Shah came to be recognized as a spokesman for Sufism in the West and lectured as a visiting professor at a number of Western universities. His works have played a significant part in presenting Sufism as a form of spiritual wisdom approachable by individuals and not necessarily attached to any specific religion.

== Life ==
=== Family and early life ===
Idries Shah was born in Simla, Punjab Province, British India, to an Afghan-Indian father of Pashtun descent; Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, a writer and diplomat, and a Scottish mother; Saira Elizabeth Luiza Shah. His family on the paternal side were Musavi Sayyids. Their ancestral home was near the Paghman Gardens of Kabul, Afghanistan. His paternal grandfather, Sayed Amjad Ali Shah, was the &quot;nawab&quot; of Sardhana in the North-Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, a hereditary title the family had gained thanks to the services an earlier ancestor, Jan-Fishan Khan, had rendered to the British.

Shah mainly grew up in the vicinity of London. According to L. F. Rushbrook Williams, Shah began accompanying his father in his travels from a very young age, and although they both travelled widely and often, they always returned to England, where the family made their home for many years. Through these travels, which were often part of Ikbal Ali Shah&#x27;s Sufi work, Shah was able to meet and spend time with prominent statesmen and distinguished personalities in both East and West. Williams writes,
Such an upbringing presented to a young man of marked intelligence, such as Idries Shah soon proved himself to possess, many opportunities to acquire a truly international outlook, a broad vision, and an acquaintance with people and places that any professional diplomat of more advanced age and longer experience might well envy. But a career of diplomacy did not attract Idries Shah...

Shah described his own unconventional upbringing in a 1971 BBC interview with Pat Williams. He described how his father and his extended family and friends always tried to expose the children to a &quot;multiplicity of impacts&quot; and a wide range of contacts and experiences with the intention of producing a well-rounded person. Shah described this as &quot;the Sufi approach&quot; to education.

After his family moved from London to Oxford in 1940 to escape The Blitz (German bombing), he spent two or three years at the City of Oxford High School for Boys. In 1945, he accompanied his father to Uruguay as secretary to his father&#x27;s &quot;halal&quot; meat mission. He returned to England in October 1946, following allegations of improper business dealings.

=== Personal life ===

Shah married the Parsi-Zoroastrian Cynthia (Kashfi) Kabraji, daughter of Indian poet Fredoon Kabraji, in 1958; they had a daughter, Saira Shah, in 1964, followed by twins – a son, Tahir Shah, and another daughter, Safia Shah – in 1966.

=== Friendship with Gerald Gardner and Robert Graves, and publication of &quot;The Sufis&quot; ===

Towards the end of the 1950s, Shah established contact with Wiccan circles in London and then acted as a secretary and companion to Gerald Gardner, the founder of modern Wicca, for some time. In those days, Shah used to hold court for anyone interested in Sufism at a table in the Cosmo restaurant in Swiss Cottage (North London) every Tuesday evening.

In 1960, Shah founded his publishing house, Octagon Press; one of its first titles was Gardner&#x27;s biography – &quot;Gerald Gardner, Witch&quot;. The book was attributed to one of Gardner&#x27;s followers, Jack L. Bracelin, but had in fact been written by Shah.

According to Wiccan Frederic Lamond, Bracelin&#x27;s name was used because Shah &quot;did not want to confuse his Sufi students by being seen to take an interest in another esoteric tradition.&quot; Lamond said that Shah seemed to have become somewhat disillusioned with Gardner, and had told him one day, when he was visiting for tea:When I was interviewing Gerald, I sometimes wished I was a &quot;News of the World&quot; reporter. What marvellous material for an exposé! And yet I have it on good authority that this group will be the cornerstone of the religion of the coming age. But rationally, rationally I can&#x27;t see it!

In January 1961, while on a trip to Mallorca with Gardner, Shah met the English poet Robert Graves. Shah wrote to Graves from his &quot;pension&quot; in Palma, requesting an opportunity of &quot;saluting you one day before very long&quot;. He added that he was currently researching ecstatic religions, and that he had been &quot;attending... experiments conducted by the witches in Britain, into mushroom-eating and so on&quot; – a topic that had been of interest to Graves for some time.

Shah also told Graves that he was &quot;intensely preoccupied at the moment with the carrying forward of ecstatic and intuitive knowledge.&quot; Graves and Shah soon became close friends and confidants. Graves took a supportive interest in Shah&#x27;s writing career and encouraged him to publish an authoritative treatment of Sufism for a Western readership, along with the practical means for its study; this was to become &quot;The Sufis&quot;. Shah managed to obtain a substantial advance on the book, resolving temporary financial difficulties.

In 1964, &quot;The Sufis&quot; appeared, published by Doubleday, Robert Graves&#x27;s American publisher, with a long introduction by Graves. The book chronicles the impact of Sufism on the development of Western civilisation and traditions from the seventh century onward through the work of such figures as Roger Bacon, John of the Cross, Raymond Lully, Chaucer and others. Like Shah&#x27;s other books on the topic, &quot;The Sufis&quot; was conspicuous for avoiding terminology that might have identified his interpretation of Sufism with traditional Islam.

The book also employed a deliberately &quot;scattered&quot; style; Shah wrote to Graves that its aim was to &quot;de-condition people, and prevent their reconditioning&quot;; had it been otherwise, he might have used a more conventional form of exposition. The book sold poorly at first, and Shah invested a considerable amount of his own money in advertising it. Graves told him not to worry; even though he had some misgivings about the writing, and was hurt that Shah had not allowed him to proofread it before publication, he said he was &quot;so proud in having assisted in its publication&quot;, and assured Shah that it was &quot;a marvellous book, and will be recognised as such before long. Leave it to find its own readers who will hear your voice spreading, not those envisaged by Doubleday.&quot;

=== John G. Bennett and the Gurdjieff connection ===

In June 1962, a couple of years prior to the publication of &quot;The Sufis&quot;, Shah had also established contact with members of the movement that had formed around the mystical teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. A press article had appeared, describing the author&#x27;s visit to a secret monastery in Central Asia, where methods strikingly similar to Gurdjieff&#x27;s methods were apparently being taught. The otherwise unattested monastery had, it was implied, a representative in England.

One of Ouspensky&#x27;s earliest pupils, Reggie Hoare, who had been part of the Gurdjieff work since 1924, made contact with Shah through that article. Hoare &quot;attached special significance to what Shah had told him about the enneagram symbol and said that Shah had revealed secrets about it that went far beyond what we had heard from Ouspensky.&quot; Through Hoare, Shah was introduced to other Gurdjieffians, including John G. Bennett, a noted Gurdjieff student and founder of an &quot;Institute for the Comparative Study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences&quot; located at Coombe Springs, a estate in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey.

At that time, Bennett had already investigated the Sufi origins of many of Gurdjieff&#x27;s teachings, based on both Gurdjieff&#x27;s own numerous statements, and on travels Bennett himself made in the East where he met various Sufi Sheikhs. He was convinced that Gurdjieff had adopted many of the ideas and techniques of the Sufis and that, for those who heard Gurdjieff&#x27;s lectures in the early 1920s, &quot;the Sufi origin of his teaching was unmistakable to anyone who had studied both.&quot;

Bennett wrote about his first meeting with Shah in his autobiography &quot;Witness&quot; (1974):At first, I was wary. I had just decided to go forward on my own and now another &#x27;teacher&#x27; had appeared. One or two conversations with Reggie convinced me that I ought at least to see for myself. Elizabeth and I went to dinner with the Hoares to meet Shah, who turned out to be a young man in his early 40s. He spoke impeccable English and but for his beard and some of his gestures might well have been taken for an English public school type. Our first impressions were unfavourable. He was restless, smoked incessantly and seemed too intent on making a good impression. Halfway through the evening, our attitude completely changed. We recognized that he was not only an unusually gifted man, but that he had the indefinable something that marks the man who has worked seriously upon himself... Knowing Reggie to be a very cautious man, trained moreover in assessing information by many years in the Intelligence Service, I accepted his assurances and also his belief that Shah had a very important mission in the West that we ought to help him to accomplish.

Shah gave Bennett a &quot;Declaration of the People of the Tradition&quot; and authorised him to share this with other Gurdjieffians. The document announced that there was now an opportunity for the transmission of &quot;a secret, hidden, special, superior form of knowledge&quot;; combined with the personal impression Bennett formed of Shah, it convinced Bennett that Shah was a genuine emissary of the &quot;Sarmoung Monastery&quot; in Afghanistan, an inner circle of Sufis whose teachings had inspired Gurdjieff.

For the next few years, Bennett and Shah had weekly private talks that lasted for hours. Later, Shah also gave talks to the students at Coombe Springs. Bennett says that Shah&#x27;s plans included &quot;reaching people who occupied positions of authority and power who were already half-consciously aware that the problems of mankind could no longer be solved by economic, political or social action. Such people were touched, he said, by the new forces moving in the world to help mankind to survive the coming crisis.&quot;

Bennett agreed with these ideas and also agreed that &quot;people attracted by overtly spiritual or esoteric movements seldom possessed the qualities needed to reach and occupy positions of authority&quot; and that &quot;there were sufficient grounds for believing that throughout the world there were already people occupying important positions, who were capable of looking beyond the limitations of nationality and cultures and who could see for themselves that the only hope for mankind lies in the intervention of a Higher Source.&quot;

Bennett wrote, &quot;I had seen enough of Shah to know that he was no charlatan or idle boaster and that he was intensely serious about the task he had been given.&quot; Due to extreme pressure from Shah, Bennett decided in 1965, after agonising for a long time and discussing the matter with the council and members of his Institute, to give the Coombe Springs property to Shah, who had insisted that any such gift must be made with no strings attached. Once the property was transferred to Shah, he banned Bennett&#x27;s associates from visiting, and made Bennett himself feel unwelcome.

Bennett says he did receive an invitation to the &quot;Midsummer Revels&quot;, a party Shah held at Coombe Springs that lasted two days and two nights, primarily for the young people whom Shah was then attracting. Anthony Blake, who worked with Bennett for 15 years, says, &quot;When Idries Shah acquired Coombe Springs, his main activity was giving parties. I had only a few encounters with him but much enjoyed his irreverent attitude. Bennett once said to me, &#x27;There are different styles in the work. Mine is like Gurdjieff&#x27;s, around struggle with one&#x27;s denial. But Shah&#x27;s way is to treat the work as a joke.&#x27;&quot;

After a few months, Shah sold the plot – worth more than £100,000 – to a developer and used the proceeds to establish himself and his work activities at Langton House in Langton Green, near Tunbridge Wells, a estate that once belonged to the family of Lord Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts.

Along with the Coombe Springs property, Bennett also handed the care of his body of pupils to Shah, comprising some 300 people. Shah promised he would integrate all those who were suitable; about half of their number found a place in Shah&#x27;s work. Some 20 years later, the Gurdjieffian author James Moore suggested that Bennett had been duped by Shah. Bennett gave an account of the matter himself in his autobiography (1974); he said that Shah&#x27;s behaviour after the transfer of the property was &quot;hard to bear&quot;, but also insisted that Shah was a &quot;man of exquisite manners and delicate sensibilities&quot; and considered that Shah might have adopted his behaviour deliberately, &quot;to make sure that all bonds with Coombe Springs were severed&quot;. He added that Langton Green was a far more suitable place for Shah&#x27;s work than Coombe Springs could have been and said he felt no sadness that Coombe Springs lost its identity; he concluded his account of the matter by stating that he had &quot;gained freedom&quot; through his contact with Shah, and had learned &quot;to love people whom [he] could not understand&quot;.

According to Bennett, Shah later also engaged in discussions with the heads of the Gurdjieff groups in New York. In a letter to Paul Anderson from 5 March 1968, Bennett wrote, &quot;Madame de Salzmann and all the others... are aware of their own limitations and do no more than they are able to do. While I was in New York, Elizabeth and I visited the Foundation, and we saw most of the leading people in the New York group as well as Jeanne de Salzmann herself. Something is preparing, but whether it will come to fruition I cannot tell. I refer to their connection with Idries Shah and his capacity for turning everything upside down. It is useless with such people to be passive, and it is useless to avoid the issue. For the time being, we can only hope that some good will come, and meanwhile continue our own work...&quot;

The author and clinical psychologist Kathleen Speeth later wrote,

Witnessing the growing conservatism within the [Gurdjieff] Foundation, John Bennett hoped new blood and leadership would come from elsewhere... Although there may have been flirtation with Shah, nothing came of it. The prevailing sense [among the leaders of the Gurdjieff work] that nothing must change, that a treasure in their safekeeping must at all costs be preserved in its original form, was stronger than any wish for a new wave of inspiration.&quot;

=== Sufi studies and institutes ===

In 1965, Shah founded the Society for Understanding Fundamental Ideas (SUFI), later renamed The Institute for Cultural Research (ICR) – an educational charity aimed at stimulating &quot;study, debate, education and research into all aspects of human thought, behaviour and culture&quot;. He also established the Society for Sufi Studies (SSS).

Langton House at Langton Green became a place of gathering and discussion for poets, philosophers and statesmen from around the world, and an established part of the literary scene of the time. The ICR held meetings and gave lectures there, awarding fellowships to international scholars including Sir John Glubb, Aquila Berlas Kiani, Richard Gregory and Robert Cecil, the head of European studies at the University of Reading who became chairman of the institute in the early 1970s.

Shah was an early member and supporter of the Club of Rome. Fellow Club of Rome members, such as scientist Alexander King made presentations at the Institute.

Other visitors, pupils, and would-be pupils included the poet Ted Hughes, novelists J. D. Salinger, Alan Sillitoe and Doris Lessing, zoologist Desmond Morris, and psychologist Robert Ornstein. The interior of the house was decorated in a Middle-Eastern fashion, and buffet lunches were held every Sunday for guests in a large dining room that was once the estate stable, nicknamed &quot;The Elephant&quot; (a reference to the Eastern tale of the &quot;Elephant in the Dark&quot;).

Over the following years, Shah developed Octagon Press as a means of publishing and distributing reprints of translations of numerous Sufi classics. In addition, he collected, translated and wrote thousands of Sufi tales, making these available to a Western audience through his books and lectures. Several of Shah&#x27;s books feature the Mullah Nasruddin character, sometimes with illustrations provided by Richard Williams. In Shah&#x27;s interpretation, the Mulla Nasruddin stories, previously considered a folkloric part of Muslim cultures, were presented as Sufi parables.

Nasruddin was featured in Shah&#x27;s television documentary &quot;Dreamwalkers&quot;, which aired on the BBC in 1970. Segments included Richard Williams being interviewed about his unfinished animated film about Nasruddin, and scientist John Kermisch discussing the use of Nasruddin stories at the Rand Corporation Think Tank. Other guests included the British psychiatrist William Sargant discussing the hampering effects of brainwashing and social conditioning on creativity and problem-solving, and the comedian Marty Feldman talking with Shah about the role of humour and ritual in human life. The program ended with Shah asserting that humanity could further its own evolution by &quot;breaking psychological limitations&quot; but that there was a &quot;constant accretion of pessimism which effectively prevents evolution in this form from going ahead... Man is asleep – must he die before he wakes up?&quot;

Shah also organised Sufi study groups in the United States. Claudio Naranjo, a Chilean psychiatrist who was teaching in California in the late 1960s, says that, after being &quot;disappointed in the extent to which Gurdjieff&#x27;s school entailed a living lineage&quot;, he had turned towards Sufism and had &quot;become part of a group under the guidance of Idries Shah.&quot; Naranjo co-wrote a book with Robert Ornstein, entitled &quot;On The Psychology of Meditation&quot; (1971). Both of them were associated with the University of California, where Ornstein was a research psychologist at the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute.

Ornstein was also president and founder of the Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge, established in 1969; seeing a need in the U.S. for books and collections on ancient and new ways of thinking, he formed the ISHK Book Service in 1972 as a central source for important contemporary and traditional literature, becoming the sole U.S. distributor of the works of Idries Shah published by Octagon Press.

Another Shah associate, the scientist and professor Leonard Lewin, who was teaching telecommunications at the University of Colorado at the time, set up Sufi study groups and other enterprises for the promotion of Sufi ideas like the Institute for Research on the Dissemination of Human Knowledge (IRDHK), and also edited an anthology of writings by and about Shah entitled &quot;The Diffusion of Sufi Ideas in the West&quot; (1972).

The planned animated feature film by Williams, provisionally titled &quot;The Amazing Nasruddin&quot;, never materialised, as the relationship between Williams and the Shah family soured in 1972 amid disputes about copyrights and funds; however, Williams later used some of the ideas for his film &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;.

=== Later years ===

Shah wrote around two dozen more books over the following decades, many of them drawing on classical Sufi sources. Achieving a huge worldwide circulation, his writings appealed primarily to an intellectually oriented Western audience. By translating Sufi teachings into contemporary psychological language, he presented them in vernacular and hence accessible terms. His folktales, illustrating Sufi wisdom through anecdote and example, proved particularly popular. Shah received and accepted invitations to lecture as a visiting professor at academic institutions including the University of California, the University of Geneva, the National University of La Plata and various English universities. Besides his literary and educational work, he found time to design an air ioniser (forming a company together with Coppy Laws) and run a number of textile, ceramics and electronics companies. He also undertook several journeys to his ancestral Afghanistan and involved himself in setting up relief efforts there; he drew on these experiences later on in his book &quot;Kara Kush&quot;, a novel about the Soviet–Afghan War.

=== Illness ===

In late spring of 1987, about a year after his final visit to Afghanistan, Shah suffered two successive and massive heart attacks. He was told that he had only eight per cent of his heart function left, and could not expect to survive. Despite intermittent bouts of illness, he continued working and produced further books over the next nine years.

=== Death ===
Idries Shah died in London on 23 November 1996, at the age of 72 and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery. According to his obituary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Idries Shah was a collaborator with Mujahideen in the Soviet–Afghan War, a Director of Studies for the Institute for Cultural Research and a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables. He was also a member of the Athenaeum Club. At the time of his death, Shah&#x27;s books had sold over 15 million copies in a dozen languages worldwide, and had been reviewed in numerous international journals and newspapers.

== Teachings ==
=== Books on magic and the occult ===

Shah&#x27;s early books were studies of what he called &quot;minority beliefs&quot;. His first book &quot;Oriental Magic&quot;, published in 1956, was originally intended to be titled &quot;Considerations in Eastern and African Minority Beliefs&quot;. He followed this in 1957 with &quot;The Secret Lore of Magic: Book of the Sorcerers&quot;, originally entitled &quot;Some Materials on European Minority-Belief Literature&quot;. The names of these books were, according to a contributor to a 1973 &quot;festschrift&quot; for Shah, changed before publication due to the &quot;exigencies of commercial publishing practices.&quot;

Before his death in 1969, Shah&#x27;s father asserted that the reason why he and his son had published books on the subject of magic and the occult was &quot;to forestall a probable popular revival or belief among a significant number of people in this nonsense. My son... eventually completed this task, when he researched for several years and published two important books on the subject.&quot;

In an interview in &quot;Psychology Today&quot; from 1975, Shah elaborated:The main purpose of my books on magic was to make this material available to the general reader. For too long people believed that there were secret books, hidden places, and amazing things. They held onto this information as something to frighten themselves with. So the first purpose was information. This is the magic of East and West. That&#x27;s all. There is no more. The second purpose of those books was to show that there do seem to be forces, some of which are either rationalized by this magic or may be developed from it, which do not come within customary physics or within the experience of ordinary people. I think this should be studied, that we should gather the data and analyze the phenomena. We need to separate the chemistry of magic from the alchemy, as it were.

Shah went on to say that his books on the subject were not written for the current devotees of magic and witchcraft, and that in fact he subsequently had to avoid them, as they would only be disappointed in what he had to say.

These books were followed by the publication of the travelogue &quot;Destination Mecca&quot; (1957), which was featured on television by Sir David Attenborough. Both &quot;Destination Mecca&quot; and &quot;Oriental Magic&quot; contain sections on the subject of Sufism.

=== Sufism as a form of timeless wisdom ===

Shah presented Sufism as a form of timeless wisdom that predated Islam. He emphasised that the nature of Sufism was alive, not static, and that it always adapted its visible manifestations to new times, places and people: &quot;Sufi schools are like waves which break upon rocks: [they are] from the same sea, in different forms, for the same purpose,&quot; he wrote, quoting Ahmad al-Badawi.

Shah was often dismissive of orientalists&#x27; descriptions of Sufism, holding that academic or personal study of its historical forms and methods was not a sufficient basis for gaining a correct understanding of it. In fact, an obsession with its traditional forms might actually become an obstacle: &quot;Show a man too many camels&#x27; bones, or show them to him too often, and he will not be able to recognise a camel when he comes across a live one,&quot; is how he expressed this idea in one of his books.

Shah, like Inayat Khan, presented Sufism as a path that transcended individual religions, and adapted it to a Western audience. Unlike Khan, however, he deemphasised religious or spiritual trappings and portrayed Sufism as a psychological technology, a method or science that could be used to achieve self-realisation. In doing so, his approach seemed to be especially addressed to followers of Gurdjieff, students of the Human Potential Movement, and intellectuals acquainted with modern psychology. For example, he wrote, &quot;Sufism ... states that man may become objective, and that objectivity enables the individual to grasp &#x27;higher&#x27; facts. Man is therefore invited to push his evolution ahead towards what is sometimes called in Sufism &#x27;real intellect&#x27;.&quot; Shah taught that the human being could acquire new subtle sense organs in response to need:

Shah dismissed other Eastern and Western projections of Sufism as &quot;watered down, generalised or partial&quot;; he included in this not only Khan&#x27;s version, but also the overtly Muslim forms of Sufism found in most Islamic countries. On the other hand, the writings of Shah&#x27;s associates implied that he was the &quot;Grand Sheikh of the Sufis&quot; – a position of authority undercut by the failure of any other Sufis to acknowledge its existence. Shah felt the best way to introduce Sufi wisdom in the West, while at the same time overcoming the problems of gurus and cults, was to clarify the difference between a cult and an educational system, and to contribute to knowledge. In an interview, he explained,
&quot;You must work within an educational pattern – not in the mumbo-jumbo area.&quot; As part of this approach, he acted as Director of Studies at the ICR. He also lectured on the study of Sufism in the West at the University of Sussex in 1966. This was later published as a monograph entitled &quot;Special Problems in the Study of Sufi Ideas.&quot;

Shah later explained that Sufi activities were divided into different components or departments: &quot;studies &quot;in&quot; Sufism&quot;, &quot;studies &quot;of&quot; Sufism&quot;, and &quot;studies &quot;for&quot; Sufism&quot;.

Studies &quot;for&quot; Sufism helped lead people towards Sufism and included the promotion of knowledge which might be lacking in the culture and needed to be restored and spread, such as an understanding of social conditioning and brainwashing, the difference between the rational and intuitive modes of thought, and other activities so that people&#x27;s minds could become more free and wide-ranging. Studies &quot;of&quot; Sufism included institutions and activities, such as lectures and seminars, which provided information about Sufism and acted as a cultural liaison between the Sufis and the public. Finally, Studies &quot;in&quot; Sufism referred to being in a Sufi school, carrying out those activities prescribed by the teacher as part of a training, and this could take many forms which did not necessarily fit into the preconceived notion of a &quot;mystical school&quot;.

Shah&#x27;s Sufi aims and methodologies were also delineated in the &quot;Declaration of the People of the Tradition&quot; given at Coombe Springs:
In addition to making this announcement, to feeding into certain fields of thought certain ideas, and pointing out some of the factors surrounding this work, the projectors of this declaration have a practical task. This task is to locate individuals who have the capacity for obtaining the special knowledge of man which is available; to group them in a special, not haphazard, manner, so that each such group forms a harmonious organism; to do this in the right place at the right time; to provide an external and interior format with which to work, as well as a formulation of &#x27;ideas&#x27; suitable to local conditions; to balance theory with practice.

In a BBC interview from 1971, Shah explained his contemporary, adaptive approach: &quot;I am interested in making available in the West those aspects of Sufism which shall be of use to the West at this time. I don&#x27;t want to turn good Europeans into poor Asiatics. People have asked me why I don&#x27;t use traditional methods of spiritual training, for instance, in dealing with people who seek me out or hunt me down; and of course, the answer is, that it&#x27;s for the same reason that you came to my house today in a motorcar and not on the back of a camel. Sufism is, in fact, not a mystical system, not a religion, but a body of knowledge.&quot;

Shah frequently characterised some of his work as really only preliminary to actual Sufi study, in the same way that learning to read and write might be seen as preliminary to a study of literature: &quot;Unless the psychology is correctly oriented, there is no spirituality, though there can be obsession and emotionality, often mistaken for it.&quot; &quot;Anyone trying to graft spiritual practices upon an unregenerate personality ... will end up with an aberration&quot;, he argued. For this reason, most of the work he produced from &quot;The Sufis&quot; onwards was psychological in nature, focused on attacking the &quot;nafs-i-ammara&quot;, the false self: &quot;I have nothing to give you except the way to understand how to seek – but you think you can already do that.&quot;

Shah was frequently criticised for not mentioning God very much in his writings; his reply was that given man&#x27;s present state, there would not be much point in talking about God. He illustrated the problem in a parable in his book &quot;Thinkers of the East&quot;: &quot;Finding I could speak the language of ants, I approached one and inquired, &#x27;What is God like? Does he resemble the ant?&#x27; He answered, &#x27;God! No indeed – we have only a single sting but God, He has &quot;two&quot;!&#x27;&quot;

=== Teaching stories ===
Shah used teaching stories and humour to great effect in his work. Shah emphasised the therapeutic function of surprising anecdotes, and the fresh perspectives these tales revealed. The reading and discussion of such tales in a group setting became a significant part of the activities in which the members of Shah&#x27;s study circles engaged. The transformative way in which these puzzling or surprising tales could destabilise the student&#x27;s normal (and unaware) mode of consciousness was studied by Stanford University psychology professor Robert Ornstein, who along with fellow psychologist Charles Tart and eminent writers such as Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Nobel-Prize-winning novelist Doris Lessing was one of several notable thinkers profoundly influenced by Shah.

Shah and Ornstein met in the 1960s. Realising that Ornstein could be an ideal partner in propagating his teachings, translating them into the idiom of psychotherapy, Shah made him his deputy (&quot;khalifa&quot;) in the United States. Ornstein&#x27;s &quot;The Psychology of Consciousness&quot; (1972) was enthusiastically received by the academic psychology community, as it coincided with new interests in the field, such as the study of biofeedback and other techniques designed to achieve shifts in mood and awareness. Ornstein has published more books in the field over the years.

Philosopher of science and physicist Henri Bortoft used teaching tales from Shah&#x27;s corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Bortoft&#x27;s &quot;The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe&#x27;s Way of Science&quot; includes tales from &quot;Tales of the Dervishes&quot;, &quot;The Exploits of the Incomparable Mullah Nasruddin&quot; and &quot;A Perfumed Scorpion&quot;.

In their original historical and cultural setting, Sufi teaching stories of the kind popularised by Shah – first told orally, and later written down for the purpose of transmitting Sufi faith and practice to successive generations – were considered suitable for people of all ages, including children, as they contained multiple layers of meaning. Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach: &quot;A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you. You can eat the peach and taste a further delight ... You can throw away the stone – or crack it and find a delicious kernel within. This is the hidden depth.&quot; It was in this manner that Shah invited his audience to receive the Sufi story. By failing to uncover the kernel, and regarding the story as merely amusing or superficial, a person would accomplish nothing more than looking at the peach, while others internalised the tale and allowed themselves to be touched by it.

Tahir Shah mentions his father&#x27;s storytelling at several points throughout his 2008 book &quot;In Arabian Nights&quot;, first to discuss how Idries Shah made use of teaching stories: &quot;My father never told us how the stories worked. He did not reveal the layers, the nuggets of information, the fragments of truth and fantasy. He didn&#x27;t need to – because, given the right conditions, the stories activated, sowing themselves.&quot; He then explains how his father used these stories to impart wisdom: &quot;My father always had a tale at hand to divert our attention, or to use as a way of transmitting an idea or a thought. He used to say that the great collections of stories from the East were like encyclopedias, storehouses of wisdom and knowledge ready to be studied, to be appreciated and cherished. To him, stories represented much more than mere entertainment. He saw them as complex psychological documents, forming a body of knowledge that had been collected and refined since the dawn of humanity and, more often than not, passed down by word of mouth.&quot;

Later on in the book, he continues his discussion of stories as teaching tools, quoting the following explanation his father gave him at the end of a story:
Olav Hammer, in &quot;Sufism in Europe and North America&quot; (2004), cites an example of such a story. It tells of a man who is looking for his key on the ground. When a passing neighbour asks the man whether this is in fact the place where he lost the key, the man replies, &quot;No, I lost it at home, but there is more light here than in my own house.&quot; Versions of this story have been known for many years in the West (see Streetlight effect). This is an example of the long-noted phenomenon of similar tales existing in many different cultures, which was a central idea in Shah&#x27;s folktale collection &quot;World Tales&quot;.

Peter Wilson, writing in &quot;New Trends and Developments in the World of Islam&quot; (1998), quotes another such story, featuring a dervish who is asked to describe the qualities of his teacher, Alim. The dervish explains that Alim wrote beautiful poetry, and inspired him with his self-sacrifice and his service to his fellow man. His questioner readily approves of these qualities, only to find the dervish rebuking him: &quot;Those are the qualities which would have recommended Alim to &quot;you&quot;.&quot; Then he proceeds to list the qualities which actually enabled Alim to be an effective teacher: &quot;Hazrat Alim Azimi made me irritated, which caused me to examine my irritation, to trace its source. Alim Azimi made me angry, so that I could feel and transform my anger.&quot; He explains that Alim Azimi followed the path of blame, intentionally provoking vicious attacks upon himself, in order to bring the failings of both his students and critics to light, allowing them to be seen for what they really were: &quot;He showed us the strange, so that the strange became commonplace and we could realise what it really is.&quot;

=== Views on culture and practical life ===

Shah&#x27;s concern was to reveal essentials underlying all cultures, and the hidden factors determining individual behaviour. He discounted the Western focus on appearances and superficialities, which often reflected mere fashion and habit, and drew attention to the origins of culture and the unconscious and mixed motivations of people and the groups formed by them. He pointed out how both on the individual and group levels, short-term disasters often turn into blessings – and vice versa – and yet the knowledge of this has done little to affect the way people respond to events as they occur.

Shah did not advocate the abandonment of worldly duties; instead, he argued that the treasure sought by the would-be disciple should derive from one&#x27;s struggles in everyday living. He considered practical work the means through which a seeker could do self-work, in line with the traditional adoption by Sufis of ordinary professions, through which they earned their livelihoods and &quot;worked&quot; on themselves.

Shah&#x27;s status as a teacher remained indefinable; disclaiming both the guru identity and any desire to found a cult or sect, he also rejected the academic hat. Michael Rubinstein, writing in &quot;Makers of Modern Culture&quot;, concluded that &quot;he is perhaps best seen as an embodiment of the tradition in which the contemplative and intuitive aspects of the mind are regarded as being most productive when working together.&quot;

=== Legacy ===

Idries Shah considered his books his legacy; in themselves, they would fulfil the function he had fulfilled when he could no longer be there. Promoting and distributing their teacher&#x27;s publications has been an important activity or &quot;work&quot; for Shah&#x27;s students, both for fund-raising purposes and for transforming public awareness. The ICR suspended its activities in 2013 following the formation of a new charity, The Idries Shah Foundation, while the SSS had ceased its activities earlier. The ISHK (Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge), headed by Ornstein, is active in the United States; after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, for example, it sent out a brochure advertising Afghanistan-related books authored by Shah and his circle to members of the Middle East Studies Association, thus linking these publications to the need for improved cross-cultural understanding.

When Elizabeth Hall interviewed Shah for &quot;Psychology Today&quot; in July 1975, she asked him: &quot;For the sake of humanity, what would you like to see happen?&quot; Shah replied: &quot;What I would really want, in case anybody is listening, is for the products of the last 50 years of psychological research to be studied by the public, by everybody, so that the findings become part of their way of thinking (...) they have this great body of psychological information and refuse to use it.&quot;

Shah&#x27;s brother, Omar Ali-Shah (1922–2005), was also a writer and teacher of Sufism; the brothers taught students together for a while in the 1960s, but in 1977 &quot;agreed to disagree&quot; and went their separate ways. Following Idries Shah&#x27;s death in 1996, a fair number of his students became affiliated with Omar Ali-Shah&#x27;s movement.

One of Shah&#x27;s daughters, Saira Shah, became notable in 2001 for reporting on women&#x27;s rights in Afghanistan in her documentary &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot;. His son, Tahir Shah, is a noted travel writer, journalist and adventurer.

==== Translations ====

Idries Shah&#x27;s works have been translated into many languages, such as French, German, Latvian, Persian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish and others.

Idries Shah work was relatively late to reach the Polish reader. The pioneering translation into Polish was done by specialist in Iranian studies and translator Ivonna Nowicka who rendered the &quot;Tales of the Dervishes&quot; of her own initiative in 1999–2000. After a few unsuccessful attempts, she managed to find a publisher, the WAM Publishing House, and the book was finally published in 2002. The &quot;Wisdom of the Fools&quot; and &quot;The Magic Monastery&quot; in her translation followed in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

== Reception ==

Shah&#x27;s books on Sufism achieved considerable critical acclaim. He was the subject of a BBC documentary (&quot;One Pair of Eyes&quot;) in 1969, and two of his works (&quot;The Way of the Sufi&quot; and &quot;Reflections&quot;) were chosen as &quot;Outstanding Book of the Year&quot; by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Critics&quot; programme. Among other honours, Shah won six first prizes at the UNESCO World Book Year in 1973, and the Islamic scholar James Kritzeck, commenting on Shah&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Dervishes&quot;, said that it was &quot;beautifully translated&quot;.

A collection of positive assessments of Shah&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Sufi Studies: East and West&quot; was published in 1973 which included, among others, contributions from L. F. Rushbrook Williams, Rom Landau, Mohammad Hidayatullah, Gyula Germanus, Sir John Glubb, Sir Razik Fareed, Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi, Ahmet Emin Yalman, Mahmoud Youssef Shawarbi and Nasrollah S. Fatemi.

Colin Wilson stated that &quot;partly through Idries Shah, I have begun to see some rather new and interesting implications [about the subject of mysticism]&quot; and in his review of &quot;The Magic Monastery&quot; (1972) noted that Shah &quot;is not primarily concerned with propagating some secret doctrine. He is concerned with the method by which mystical knowledge is transmitted... [The Sufis] transmit knowledge through direct intuition rather in the manner of the Zen masters, and one of the chief means of doing this is by means of brief stories and parables which work their way into the subconscious and activate its hidden forces.&quot;

In Afghanistan, the &quot;Kabul Times&quot; said that &quot;Caravan of Dreams&quot; (1968) was &quot;highly recommended&quot; and &quot;of especial interest to Afghans&quot; because it is &quot;basically an anthology of short stories, tales and proverbs, jokes and extracts, from the written and oral literature which forms a part of many an evening&#x27;s talk and interchange – even in these modern times – in Afghanistan.&quot; &quot;The Afghanistan News&quot; reported that &quot;The Sufis&quot; &quot;covers important Afghan contributions to world philosophy and science&quot; and was &quot;the first authoritative book on Sufism and the human development system of the dervishes.&quot; As far as doubts about Shah&#x27;s background and credentials are concerned, the Sardar Haji Faiz Muhammad Khan Zikeria, an Afghan scholar who had served as Afghan Minister of Education and later Ambassador and Foreign Minister of Afghanistan, issued a notarized Declaration for the scholars of the world about the Shah family in 1970: &quot;The Musavi Saiyids of Afghanistan and Khans of Paghman are recognized as the descendants of the Prophet – may peace be upon him. They are recognized to be of the most noble descent of Islam and are respected as Sufi teachers and erudite scholars. Saiyid Idries Shah, son of the late Saiyid Ikbal Ali Shah, is personally known to me as an honourable man whose rank, titles and descent are attested and known by repute.&quot;

In 1980, Professor Khalilullah Khalili, former Poet Laureate of Afghanistan, praised the work of his &quot;compatriot and friend the &quot;Arif&quot; (Sufi Illuminate) The Sayed Idries Shah&quot;, saying &quot;Especially to be appreciated are his brilliant and important services in revealing the celestial inspirations and inner thoughts of the great teachers of Islam and Sufis.&quot;

The &quot;Hindustan Standard&quot; of India found that &quot;Caravan of Dreams&quot;, was a &quot;fine anthology, dippable-into at any time for entertainment, refreshment, consolation, and inspiration... witty, engrossing, utterly and appealingly human.&quot;

The Institute for Cross-cultural Exchange (ICE), a Canadian charity founded in 2004, decided to use Idries Shah&#x27;s children&#x27;s books to distribute to thousands of needy children in Canada, Mexico and Afghanistan, as part of their children&#x27;s literacy programme and promotion of cross-cultural understanding. This series of books is published by Hoopoe Books, a non-profit initiative by the American psychologist Robert Ornstein&#x27;s Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge (ISHK).

A hostile critic was James Moore, a Gurdjieffian who disagreed with Shah&#x27;s assertion that Gurdjieff&#x27;s teaching was essentially Sufic in nature and took exception to the publication of a chronologically impossible, pseudonymous book on the matter (&quot;The Teachers of Gurdjieff&quot; by Rafael Lefort) that was linked to Shah. In a 1986 article in &quot;Religion Today&quot; (now the &quot;Journal of Contemporary Religion&quot;), Moore covered the Bennett and Graves controversies and noted that Shah was surrounded by a &quot;nimbus of exorbitant adulation: an adulation he himself has fanned&quot;. He described Shah as supported by a &quot;coterie of serviceable journalists, editors, critics, animators, broadcasters, and travel writers, which gamely choruses Shah&#x27;s praise&quot;. Moore questioned Shah&#x27;s purported Sufi heritage and upbringing and deplored the body of pseudonymous &quot;Shah-school&quot; writings from such authors as &quot;Omar Michael Burke PhD&quot; and &quot;Hadrat B. M. Dervish&quot;, who from 1960 heaped intemperate praise – ostensibly from disinterested parties – on Shah, referring to him as the &quot;Tariqa Grand Sheikh Idries Shah Saheb&quot;, &quot;Prince Idries Shah&quot;, &quot;King Enoch&quot;, &quot;The Presence&quot;, &quot;The Studious King&quot;, the &quot;Incarnation of Ali&quot;, and even the Qutb or &quot;Axis&quot; – all in support of Shah&#x27;s incipient efforts to market Sufism to a Western audience.

Peter Wilson similarly commented on the &quot;very poor quality&quot; of much that had been written in Shah&#x27;s support, noting an &quot;unfortunately fulsome style&quot;, claims that Shah possessed various paranormal abilities, &quot;a tone of superiority; an attitude, sometimes smug, condescending, or pitying, towards those &#x27;on the outside&#x27;, and the apparent absence of any motivation to substantiate claims which might be thought to merit such treatment&quot;. In his view, there was a &quot;marked difference in quality between Shah&#x27;s own writings&quot; and the quality of this secondary literature. Both Moore and Wilson, however, also noted similarities in style, and considered the possibility that much of this pseudonymous work, frequently published by Octagon Press, Shah&#x27;s own publishing house, might have been written by Shah himself.

Arguing for an alternative interpretation of this literature, the religious scholar Andrew Rawlinson proposed that rather than a &quot;transparently self-serving [...] deception&quot;, it may have been a &quot;masquerade – something that by definition has to be seen through&quot;. Stating that &quot;a critique of entrenched positions cannot itself be fixed and doctrinal&quot;, and noting that Shah&#x27;s intent had always been to undermine false certainties, he argued that the &quot;Shah myth&quot; created by these writings may have been a teaching tool, rather than a tool of concealment; something &quot;made to be deconstructed – that is &quot;supposed&quot; to dissolve when you touch it&quot;. Rawlinson concluded that Shah &quot;cannot be taken at face value. His own axioms preclude the very possibility.&quot;

=== Assessment ===
Doris Lessing, one of Shah&#x27;s greatest defenders, stated in a 1981 interview: &quot;I found Sufism as taught by Idries Shah, which claims to be the reintroduction of an ancient teaching, suitable for this time and this place. It is not some regurgitated stuff from the East or watered-down Islam or anything like that.&quot; In 1996, commenting on Shah&#x27;s death in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, she stated that she met Shah because of &quot;The Sufis&quot;, which was to her the most surprising book she had read, and a book that changed her life. Describing Shah&#x27;s œuvre as a &quot;phenomenon like nothing else in our time&quot;, she characterised him as a many-sided man, the wittiest person she ever expected to meet, kind, generous, modest (&quot;Don&#x27;t look so much at my face, but take what is in my hand&quot;, she quotes him as saying), and her good friend and teacher for 30-odd years.

Arthur J. Deikman, a professor of psychiatry and long-time researcher in the area of meditation and change of consciousness who began his study of Sufi teaching stories in the early seventies, expressed the view that Western psychotherapists could benefit from the perspective provided by Sufism and its universal essence, provided suitable materials were studied in the correct manner and sequence. Given that Shah&#x27;s writings and translations of Sufi teaching stories were designed with that purpose in mind, he recommended them to those interested in assessing the matter for themselves, and noted that many authorities had accepted Shah&#x27;s position as a spokesman for contemporary Sufism. The psychologist and consciousness researcher Charles Tart commented that Shah&#x27;s writings had &quot;produced a more profound appreciation in [him] of what psychology is about than anything else ever written&quot;.

Asked to give an assessment of Shah in 1973, J.G. Bennett said that Shah was doing important work on a large scale, &quot;stirring people up very effectively all over the place, making them think, showing them that modes of thought that appear to be free are really largely conditioned.&quot; He referred to Shah as the Krishnamurti of Sufism, breaking down people&#x27;s fixed ideas in many directions as part of an awakening process that is &quot;a very necessary preparation for the new world.&quot;

The Indian philosopher and mystic Rajneesh, later known as Osho, commenting on Shah&#x27;s work, described &quot;The Sufis&quot; as &quot;just a diamond. The value of what he has done in &quot;The Sufis&quot; is immeasurable&quot;. He added that Shah was &quot;the man who introduced Mulla Nasrudin to the West, and he has done an incredible service. He cannot be repaid. [...] Idries Shah has made just the small anecdotes of Nasrudin even more beautiful ... [he] not only has the capacity to exactly translate the parables, but even to beautify them, to make them more poignant, sharper.&quot;

Richard Smoley and Jay Kinney, writing in &quot;Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions&quot; (2006), pronounced Shah&#x27;s &quot;The Sufis&quot; an &quot;extremely readable and wide-ranging introduction to Sufism&quot;, adding that &quot;Shah&#x27;s own slant is evident throughout, and some historical assertions are debatable (none are footnoted), but no other book is as successful as this one in provoking interest in Sufism for the general reader.&quot; They described &quot;Learning How to Learn&quot;, a collection of interviews, talks and short writings, as one of Shah&#x27;s best works, providing a solid orientation to his &quot;psychological&quot; approach to Sufi work, noting that at his best, &quot;Shah provides insights that inoculate students against much of the nonsense in the spiritual marketplace.&quot;

Ivan Tyrrell and social psychologist Joe Griffin, in their book about innate emotional needs, &quot;Human Givens: A new approach to emotional health and clear thinking&quot;, wrote that Shah &quot;more than anyone else, understood and appreciated the real significance of the givens of human nature&quot;. In another book, &quot;Godhead: The Brain&#x27;s Big Bang – The explosive origin of creativity, mysticism and mental illness&quot;, they said that Shah&#x27;s stories, &quot;when told to young and old alike [...] lay down blueprints in the mind, not only for living and overcoming everyday difficulties but also for travelling the spiritual path. Their impact may not be recognized or felt for months or years after first hearing or reading them, but eventually the structural content they contain will exploit the pattern-matching nature of the brain and make it possible for students to observe the functioning of their own emotionally conditioned responses to changing life circumstances. It then makes it easier for them to take any action required by reality, and for their minds to connect to higher realms. Teaching stories should be read, told and reflected on, but not intellectually analysed, because that destroys the beneficial impact that they would otherwise have had on your mind.&quot; Shah, they added, was &quot;a great collector and publisher of tales and writings that contain this &#x27;long-term impact&#x27; quality. He understood the vital importance for humanity of the &#x27;mental blueprint&#x27; aspect of them and his books are full of nourishing examples.&quot;

Olav Hammer notes that during Shah&#x27;s last years, when the generosity of admirers had made him truly wealthy, and he had become a respected figure among the higher echelons of British society, controversies arose due to discrepancies between autobiographical data – mentioning kinship with the prophet Muhammad, affiliations with a secret Sufi order in Central Asia, or the tradition in which Gurdjieff was taught – and recoverable historical facts. While there may have been a link of kinship with the prophet Muhammad, the number of people sharing such a link today, 1300 years later, would be at least one million. Other elements of Shah&#x27;s autobiography appeared to have been pure fiction. Even so, Hammer noted that Shah&#x27;s books have remained in public demand, and that he has played &quot;a significant role in representing the essence of Sufism as a non-confessional, individualistic and life-affirming distillation of spiritual wisdom.&quot;

Peter Wilson wrote that if Shah had been a swindler, he had been an &quot;extremely gifted one&quot;, because unlike merely commercial writers, he had taken the time to produce an elaborate and internally consistent system that attracted a &quot;whole range of more or less eminent people&quot;, and had &quot;provoked and stimulated thought in many diverse quarters&quot;. Moore acknowledged that Shah had made a contribution of sorts in popularising a humanistic Sufism, and had &quot;brought energy and resource to his self-aggrandisement&quot;, but ended with the damning conclusion that Shah&#x27;s was &quot;a &#x27;Sufism&#x27; without self-sacrifice, without self-transcendence, without the aspiration of gnosis, without tradition, without the Prophet, without the Qur&#x27;an, without Islam, and without God. Merely that.&quot;

Gore Vidal opined that Shah&#x27;s &quot;books are a great deal harder to read than they were to write.&quot;

==== &quot;The Sufis&quot; reception ====

The reception of Shah&#x27;s body of work was also marked by controversy. Some orientalists were hostile, in part because Shah presented classical Sufi writings as tools for self-development to be used by contemporary people, rather than as objects of historical study. The internationally renowned German orientalist Annemarie Schimmel commented that &quot;The Sufis&quot;, along with Shah&#x27;s other books, &quot;should be avoided by serious students&quot;.

Graves&#x27; introduction to &quot;The Sufis&quot;, written with Shah&#x27;s help, described Shah as being &quot;in the senior male line of descent from the prophet Mohammed&quot; and as having inherited &quot;secret mysteries from the Caliphs, his ancestors. He is, in fact, a Grand Sheikh of the Sufi &quot;Tariqa&quot;... &quot; Privately, however, writing to a friend, Graves confessed that this was &quot;misleading: he is one of us, not a Moslem personage.&quot; The introduction is not included in Octagon Press editions of the book after 1983 but has always been included in the Anchor/Doubleday editions.

Shah&#x27;s fiercest critic, University of Edinburgh scholar L.P. Elwell-Sutton, published in 1975 an article critical of what he called &quot;pseudo-Sufis&quot; like Gurdjieff and Shah. He opined that Graves had been trying to &quot;upgrade&quot; Shah&#x27;s &quot;rather undistinguished lineage&quot;, and that the reference to Mohammed&#x27;s senior male line of descent was a &quot;rather unfortunate gaffe&quot;, as Mohammed&#x27;s sons had all died in infancy. Elwell-Sutton accepted that the family were Sayyids descended from the seventh Imam Musa al-Kazim, the great-great-grandson of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the younger son of the marriage of Fatima (the daughter of the Prophet) and Ali. However, he considered this an &quot;undistinguished lineage&quot; with no special sanctity because &quot;Sayyids proliferate throughout the Islamic world, in all walks of society and on both sides of every religious and political fence.&quot; He described Shah&#x27;s books as &quot;trivial&quot;, replete with errors of fact, slovenly and inaccurate translations and even misspellings of Oriental names and words – &quot;a muddle of platitudes, irrelevancies and plain mumbo-jumbo&quot;, adding for good measure that Shah had &quot;a remarkable opinion of his own importance&quot;. He took a dim view of Rushbrook Williams&#x27; &quot;festschrift&quot; (collection written in honour) of Shah, saying he considered many of the claims made in the book on behalf of Shah and his father, concerning their representing the Sufi tradition, to be self-serving publicity marked by a &quot;disarming disregard for facts&quot;. Expressing amusement and amazement at the &quot;sycophantic manner&quot; of Shah&#x27;s interlocutors in a BBC radio interview, Elwell-Sutton concluded that some Western intellectuals were &quot;so desperate to find answers to the questions that baffle them, that, confronted with wisdom from &#x27;the mysterious East,&#x27; they abandon their critical faculties and submit to brainwashing of the crudest kind&quot;. To Elwell-Sutton, Shah&#x27;s Sufism belonged to the realm of &quot;Pseudo-Sufism&quot;, &quot;centred not on God but on man.&quot;

==== Omar Khayyam affair ====

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Shah came under attack over a controversy surrounding the 1967 publication of a new translation of Omar Khayyam&#x27;s Rubaiyat, by Robert Graves and Shah&#x27;s older brother, Omar Ali-Shah. The translation, which presented the Rubaiyat as a Sufi poem, was based on an annotated &quot;crib&quot;, supposedly derived from a manuscript that had been in the Shah family&#x27;s possession for 800 years. L. P. Elwell-Sutton, an orientalist at Edinburgh University, and others who reviewed the book expressed their conviction that the story of the ancient manuscript was false.

Shah&#x27;s father, the Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, was expected by Graves to present the original manuscript to clear the matter up, but he died in a car accident in Tangier in November 1969. A year later, Graves asked Idries Shah to produce the manuscript. Shah replied in a letter that the manuscript was not in his possession, but even if it were, producing it would prove nothing, because it could not be accurately dated using the current methods and its authenticity would still be contested. It was time, Shah wrote, &quot;that we realised that the hyenas who are making so much noise are intent only on opposition, destructiveness and carrying on a campaign when, let&#x27;s face it, nobody is really listening.&quot; He added that his father had been so infuriated by those casting these aspersions that he refused to engage with them, and he felt his father&#x27;s response had been correct. Graves, noting that he was now widely perceived as having fallen prey to the Shah brothers&#x27; gross deception, and that this affected income from sales of his other historical writings, insisted that producing the manuscript had become &quot;a matter of family honour&quot;. He pressed Shah again, reminding him of previous promises to produce the manuscript if it were necessary.

Neither of the brothers ever produced the manuscript, leading Graves&#x27; nephew and biographer to muse that it was hard to believe – bearing in mind the Shah brothers&#x27; many obligations to Graves – that they would have withheld the manuscript if it had ever existed in the first place. According to his widow writing many years later, Graves had &quot;complete faith&quot; in the authenticity of the manuscript because of his friendship with Shah, even though he never had a chance to view the text in person. The scholarly consensus today is that the &quot;Jan-Fishan Khan&quot; manuscript was a hoax, and that the Graves/Ali-Shah translation was in fact based on a Victorian amateur scholar&#x27;s analysis of the sources used by previous Rubaiyat translator Edward FitzGerald.

<text>Maurice Rouvier (; 17 April 1842 – 7 June 1911) was a French statesman of the &quot;Opportunist&quot; faction, who twice served as the Prime Minister of France. He is best known for his financial policies and his unpopular policies designed to avoid a rupture with Germany.

==Career==
He was born in Aix-en-Provence, and spent his early career in business at Marseille. He supported Léon Gambetta&#x27;s candidature there in 1867, and in 1870 he founded an anti-imperial journal, &quot;L&#x27;Egalité&quot;. He also belonged to the same masonic lodge as Gambetta, &quot;La Réforme&quot; in Marseille. Becoming secretary general of the prefecture of Bouches-du-Rhône in 1870–71, he refused the office of prefect. In July 1871 he was returned to the National Assembly for Marseille at a by-election, and voted steadily with the Republican party. He became a recognized authority on finance, and repeatedly served on the Budget Commission as reporter or president.

At the general elections of 1881, after the fall of the Jules Ferry cabinet he was returned to the chamber on a programme which included the separation of Church and State, a policy of decentralization, and the imposition of an income tax. He then joined Gambetta&#x27;s cabinet as minister of commerce and the colonies, and in the 1883-85 cabinet of Jules Ferry he held the same office. He became premier and minister of finance on 31 May 1887, with the support of the moderate republican groups, the Radicals holding aloof in support of General Boulanger, who began a violent agitation against the government.

Then came the scandal of the decorations in which President Grévy&#x27;s son-in-law Daniel Wilson figured, and the Rouvier cabinet fell in its attempt to screen the president. Rouvier&#x27;s opposition in his capacity of president of the Budget Commission was one of the causes of the defeat of Charles Floquet&#x27;s cabinet in February 1889. In the new Tirard ministry formed to combat the Boulangist agitation, he was minister of finance. He kept the same post in the Freycinet, Loubet and Ribot cabinets of 1890–93. Accusations that he accepted bribes from Cornelius Herz and the baron de Reinach compelled his resignation from the Ribot cabinet during the Panama scandals in December 1892. He became a successful banker and was known for his thorough familiarity with financial and budgetary issues.

==Prime minister==
In 1902, he once again became minister of finance, after nearly ten years of exclusion from office, in the Radical cabinet of Émile Combes; and on the fall of the Combes ministry in January 1905 he was invited by the president to form a new ministry. In this cabinet he at first held the ministry of finance. In his initial declaration to the chamber the new premier had declared his intention of continuing the policy of the previous cabinet, pledging the new ministry to a policy of conciliation, to the consideration of old age pensions, an income-tax, and separation of Church and State. Under a law passed in April 1905, for instance, a certain credit was earmarked in the French budget for the purpose of public subsidies for unemployment benefit funds.

===Foreign policy===
Public attention, however, was chiefly concentrated on foreign policy. During the Combes ministry Theophile Delcassé had come to a secret understanding with Spain on the Moroccan question, and had established an understanding with Britain. His policy had aroused German jealousy, which became evident in the asperity with which the question of Morocco was handled in Berlin.

At a cabinet meeting on 5 June Rouvier reproached the Foreign Minister with imprudence over Morocco, and after a heated discussion Delcassé resigned. Rouvier himself took the portfolio of foreign affairs at this crucial point. After critical negotiations, he secured on 8 July an agreement with Germany accepting the international conference proposed by the sultan of Morocco on the assurance that Germany would recognize the special nature of the interest of France in maintaining order on the frontier of her Algerian empire. Lengthy discussions resulted in a new convention in September, which contained the programme of the proposed conference, and in December Rouvier was able to make a statement about the whole proceedings in the chamber, which received the assent of all parties. Rouvier&#x27;s government did not long survive the presidential election of 1906.

===Church and state===
In 1905, the government introduced the law on the separation of Church and State, heavily supported by Emile Combes, who had been strictly enforcing the 1901 voluntary association law and the 1904 law on religious congregations&#x27; freedom of teaching (more than 2,500 private teaching establishments were by then closed by the State, causing bitter opposition from the Catholic and conservative population). On 10 February 1905, the Chamber declared that &quot;the attitude of the Vatican&quot; had rendered the separation of Church and State inevitable and the law of the separation of church and state was passed in December, 1905. The disturbances arising in connection with the Separation Law were skillfully handled by Georges Clemenceau to discredit the ministry, which gave place to a cabinet under the direction of Sarrien.
He died in Neuilly-sur-Seine.

<text>Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is a 1989 book by United States academic Noam Chomsky concerning political power using propaganda to distort and distract from major issues to maintain confusion and complicity, preventing real democracy from becoming effective. The title of this book borrows a phrase from the writings of Reinhold Niebuhr.

Nearly the entire first half of the book is based on Chomsky&#x27;s five 1988 Massey Lectures on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio from November 1988 and extends his and Edward S. Herman&#x27;s propaganda model to a variety of new situations. The remaining appendices address criticisms of the work and provide additional detail.

<doc id="184038" wikidata="Q503827" url="?curid=184038" title="Théophile Delcassé">
<text>Théophile Delcassé (; 1 March 185222 February 1923) was a French politician who served as foreign minister from 1898 to 1905. He is best known for his hatred of Germany and efforts to secure alliances with Russia and Great Britain that became the Entente Cordiale. He belonged to the Radical Party and was a protege of Léon Gambetta.

==Biography==
Delcassé was born on 1 March 1852, at Pamiers, in the Ariège département. He wrote articles on foreign affairs for the &quot;République Française&quot; and &quot;Le Temps&quot;, and in 1888 was elected &quot;conseiller général&quot; of his native &quot;département&quot;, standing as &quot;un disciple fidèle de Léon Gambetta&quot;. In the following year he entered the chamber as deputy for Foix.

===Colonial affairs===

Delcassé was appointed under-secretary for the colonies in the second Ribot cabinet (January to April 1893), and retained his post in the Dupuy cabinet till its fall in December 1893. It was largely owing to his efforts that the French colonial office was made a separate department with a minister at its head, and to this office he was appointed in the second Dupuy cabinet (May 1894 to January 1895). He gave a great impetus to French colonial enterprise, especially in West Africa, where he organized the newly acquired colony of Dahomey, and despatched the Liotard mission to the upper Ubangi. While in opposition, Delcassé devoted special attention to naval affairs, and in noted speeches he declared that the function of the French navy was to secure and develop colonial enterprise, deprecated all attempts to rival the British fleet, and advocated the construction of commerce destroyers as France&#x27;s best reply to England.

===Foreign minister===

On the formation of the second Brisson cabinet in June 1898 he succeeded Gabriel Hanotaux as Foreign Minister, and retained that post under the subsequent premierships of Dupuy, Waldeck-Rousseau, Combes and Rouvier. In 1898 Delcassé had to deal with the delicate situation caused by Captain Marchand&#x27;s occupation of the town of Fashoda in the Sudan (the Fashoda Incident) for which, as he admitted in a speech in the chamber on 23 January 1899, he accepted full responsibility, since it arose directly out of the Liotard expedition; and in March 1899 he concluded an agreement with Britain by which the difficulty was finally adjusted, and France consolidated her vast colonial empire in North-West Africa. In the same year he acted as mediator (the main mediator being Jules Cambon, French ambassador in Washington) between the United States of America and Spain, and brought the peace negotiations to a successful conclusion.

Delcassé was originally a moderate willing to find a compromise with Germany, but Berlin ignored his overtures. He then became very anti-German, to the point that Kaiser Wilhelm called him &quot;The most dangerous man for Germany in France.&quot; Delcassé improved relations between France and Italy: at the same time, he adhered firmly to the alliance with Russia, and in August 1899 made a visit to Saint Petersburg, which he repeated in April 1901. In June 1900 he made an arrangement with Spain, fixing the long-disputed boundaries of the French and Spanish possessions in West Africa. Finally, in his greatest achievement, he concluded the Entente Cordiale with Great Britain, covering colonial and other questions which had long been a matter of dispute, especially concerning Egypt, Newfoundland and Morocco. Suspicion of the growing entente between France and England soon arose in Germany, and in 1905 German assertiveness was shown in a crisis which was forced on in the matter of French policy by Delcassé personally, a sore point with Germany. The situation became acute, and Germany forced Delcassé&#x27;s resignation in June 1906. He retired into private life, but in 1908 was warmly welcomed on a visit to England.

===Naval affairs===
In 1909 Delcassé was appointed chairman of a commission appointed to investigate the French navy.
The report was drawn up on 24 May 1909 and concluded that the French navy was unprepared and the naval administration and organization were in disarray. Delcassé was appointed Minister of Marine on 2 March 1911 in the cabinet of Ernest Monis. Delcassé promulgated closer cooperation between the British and French fleets. This arrangement was an important factor in leading Britain to side with France against Germany when World War I started.

On 25 September 1911, as the battleship &quot;Liberté&quot; was moored in Toulon harbor, an accidental explosion in one of her forward ammunition magazines for the secondary guns destroyed the ship. 210 men died and 136 were seriously injured. The captain, Louis Jaurès, was on leave at the time. After the explosion there was a debate in the Chamber of Deputies in which the honour of Jaurès and the responsibility for the use of unstable powder by the navy was questioned. Jaurès had to face a court martial, but was acquitted unanimously on 21 December 1911. Paul Painlevé, president of the navy committee, appointed a commission of inquiry after the explosion, which followed that of the battleship &quot;Iéna&quot;. Captain Antoine Schwerer was a member of the commission of inquiry and wrote a scathing &quot;Report on Naval Powders&quot; (1912). Delcassé ordered that all ammunition made before 1907 be replaced. The older ammunition was removed from the ships, and the remainder was steadily replaced with a new explosive containing diphenylamine as a stabilizer. Continued efforts were made to improve the powders, and there were no more major disasters.
It was not until 1914 that the &quot;powder crisis&quot; was fully resolved.

Delcassé retained his position in the cabinet of Joseph Caillaux until its fall on 14 January 1912. Raymond Poincaré then urged Delcassé to become prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, but Delcassé declined; however, he would later agree to remain in Poincaré&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of the Navy.

===Later career===

President Armand Fallières&#x27; term in office expired in January 1913, and Delcassé decided to leave the Ministry of Marine and run for the presidency. 
He did not succeed. After the election, which was won by Poincaré, a new cabinet was formed by Aristide Briand.
Briand offered Delcassé the post of minister of marine or minister of war in the new cabinet, but Delcassé declined. 
He would soon be appointed ambassador to Russia, and then minister of war. On 26 August 1914 after the Germans announced successes in the north and east, René Viviani announced the resignation of the cabinet.
In the new cabinet, announced within an hour, Viviani retained his post. Delcassé was minister of foreign affairs, Aristide Briand was minister of justice and Alexandre Millerand was Minister of War.

Delcassé resigned from the Cabinet on 14 October 1915, partly on the grounds of differing opinions and partly because of ill health.

<text>Albert Auguste Gabriel Hanotaux, known as Gabriel Hanotaux (19 November 1853 – 11 April 1944) was a French and historian who was France&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1894 to 1895 and 1896 to 1898.

==Biography==
He was born at Beaurevoir in the &quot;département&quot; of Aisne. He studied history at the École des Chartes, and became &quot;maître de conférence&quot; in the École des Hautes Études. His political career was that of a civil servant rather than a party politician. In 1879 he entered the ministry of foreign affairs as a secretary, and rose gradually through the diplomatic service.

In 1886, he was elected deputy for Aisne, but, defeated in 1889, he returned to his diplomatic career, and on 31 May 1894 accepted the offer of Charles Dupuy to be minister of foreign affairs. With one interruption (from 28 October 1895 to 29 April 1896, during the ministry of Leon Bourgeois) he held this portfolio until 14 June 1898. During his ministry he developed the &quot;rapprochement&quot; of France with Russia—visiting Saint Petersburg with the president, Félix Faure—and sought to delimit the French colonies in Africa through agreements with the British. The Fashoda Incident of July 1898 was the most notable result of this policy. This seems to have intensified Hanotaux&#x27;s distrust of England, which is apparent in his literary works (though most of these were written after he had left the Quai d&#x27;Orsay).

Hanotaux was elected a member of the Académie française on 1 April 1897. He served as a delegate for France with the League of Nations and participated in the 1st (15 November – 18 December 1920), 2nd (5 September – 5 October 1921), 3rd (4–30 September 1922) and 4th Assemblies (3–29 September 1923). In the early 1920s, there were proposals for the League of Nations to accept Esperanto as a working language. Ten delegates accepted the proposals with only one voice against, the French delegate, Gabriel Hanotaux. The French employed their veto as a member of the League Council on all such votes, starting with the vote on 18 December 1920. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language of diplomacy and saw Esperanto as a threat.

Gabriel Hanotaux died in Paris in 1944 and was interred in the Passy Cemetery. His home in Orchaise now serves as a botanical garden, the Parc botanique du Prieuré d&#x27;Orchaise.

<doc id="184044" wikidata="Q157071" url="?curid=184044" title="Vicia sativa">
<text>Vicia sativa, known as the common vetch, garden vetch, tare or simply vetch, is a nitrogen-fixing leguminous plant in the family Fabaceae. It is now naturalised throughout the world occurring on every continent, except Antarctica and the Arctic. The centre of diversity is thought to be the Fertile Crescent, although gold standard molecular confirmation is currently not available. 

Global common vetch cultivation is limited due to anti-nutritional compounds in the seed although it is grown in dryland agricultural zones in Australia, China and Ethiopia due to its drought tolerance and very low nutrient requirements compared to other legumes. In these agricultural zones common vetch is grown as a green manure, livestock fodder or rotation crop. In cultivated grainfields, like lentils, it is often considered a weed due to downgrading of harvested mixed grain, resulting in farmers receiving less financial returns.

==Description==
&quot;Vicia sativa&quot; is a sprawling annual herb, with hollow, four-sided, hairless to sparsely hairy stems which can reach two meters in maximum length.

The leaves are stipulate, alternate and compound, each made up of 3–8 opposite pairs of linear, lance-shaped, oblong, or wedge-shaped, needle-tipped leaflets up to long. Each compound leaf ends in a branched tendril.

The pea-like flowers occur in the leaf axils, solitary or in pairs. The flower corolla is long and bright pink-purple in colour, more rarely whitish or yellow. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees.

The fruit is a legume pod up to long, which is hairy when new, smooth later, then brown or black when ripe. It contains 4–12 seeds.
==Cultivation==
Sown for fodder, the seed is sown densely, up to . However, when grown for seed, less seed should be used; otherwise the crop will be too thick, reducing flower and seed production. When meant for seed, sowing is done early in the planting season for good returns; but, when for green manure, any time in spring is suitable. Sometimes, a full crop can be obtained even when sown as late as summer, though sowing so late is not recommended.

After the seed is sown and the land carefully harrowed, a light roller ought to be drawn across, to smooth the surface and permit the scythe to work without interruption. Also, the field should be watched for several days to prevent pigeons from eating too much of the sown seed.

Horses thrive very well on common vetch, even better than on clover and rye grass; the same applies to fattening cattle, which feed faster on vetch than on most grasses or other edible plants. Danger often arises from livestock eating too much vetch, especially when podded; colics and other stomach disorders are apt to be produced by the excessive amounts devoured.

Cereal grains can be sown with vetch so it can use their stronger stems for support, attaching via tendrils. When grown with oats or other grasses, the vetch can grow upright; otherwise its weak stems may sprawl along the ground. Several cultivars are available for agricultural use, and as for some other legume crops, rhizobia can be added to the seed.

Pests that attack this crop include the powdery mildew fungus &quot;Erysiphe pisi&quot;, the pea aphid &quot;Acyrthosiphon pisum&quot;, the corn earworm (&quot;Heliothis zea&quot;), the fall armyworm (&quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot;), and spider mites of genus &quot;Tetranychus&quot;.

During the early 20th century, a mutant of the common vetch arose with lens-shaped seeds resembling those of the lentil, leading to vetch invasions of lentil fields. D. G. Rowlands showed in 1959 that this was due to a single recessive mutation. The transition from traditional winnowing to mechanised farming practices largely solved this problem.

Improved varieties of &quot;Vicia sativa&quot; developed by the National Vetch Breeding Program for Australian farmers include; Timok, Volga, Rasina and more recently Studenica. These varieties are mostly cultivated in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. More than per year of &quot;Vicia sativa&quot; was grown in Australia in 2019.

==History==
Common vetch has long been part of the human diet, as attested by carbonised remains found at early Neolithic sites in Syria, Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia. It has also been reported from Predynastic sites of ancient Egypt, and several Bronze Age sites in Turkmenia and Slovakia. However, definite evidence for later vetch cultivation is available only for Roman times.

Although &quot;V. sativa&quot; is sometimes known as tare, the &quot;tare&quot; referred to in some English translations of the Bible (as in the &quot;Parable of the Tares&quot;) is thought to be darnel ryegrass, &quot;Lolium temulentum&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Vicia sativa&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. Since that time, a number of synonyms have published:

*&quot;Vicia abyssinica&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia alba&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia amphicarpa&quot;

*&quot;Vicia lentisperma&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia leucosperma&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia macrocarpa&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia maculata&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia maculata&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia melanosperma&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia morisiana&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia nemoralis&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia nemoralis&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia notota&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia pallida&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia pilosa&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia pimpinelloides&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia segetalis&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia subterranea&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia terana&quot; 
*&quot;Vicia vulgaris&quot; 
There are at least four generally accepted subspecies:
* &quot;Vicia sativa&quot; subsp. &quot;cordata&quot; 
* &quot;Vicia sativa&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot; – narrow-leaved vetch (= subsp. / var. &quot;angustifolia&quot;, subsp. &quot;consobrina&quot;, subsp. &quot;cordata&quot; , subsp. &quot;cuneata&quot;, subsp. &quot;heterophylla&quot;, var. &quot;minor&quot;, var. &quot;nigra&quot;)
* &quot;Vicia sativa&quot; subsp. &quot;sativa&quot; (= var. &quot;linearis&quot;, ssp. &quot;notata&quot;)
* &quot;Vicia sativa&quot; subsp. &quot;segetalis&quot; (sometimes included in subsp. &quot;nigra&quot;)

== Genome ==
The &quot;Vicia sativa&quot; karyotype consists of 5, 6 or 7 chromosomes, with six (n=6) being the most common and best described. Given the &quot;Vicia sativa&#x27;s&quot; genome is relatively large genome size (1.75Gb) due to large amounts of repetitive DNA, sequencing the genome was challenging compared to other legumes such as &quot;Medicago truncatula&quot; or soybeans.

A high-quality chromosome level genome assembly was published in 2022 of variety Studencia (n=6), following a draft genome assembly of line KSR5 (n=7). Variety Studencia, is predicted to have 53,318 protein coding genes. Whole genome sequence comparisons showed that &quot;Vicia sativa&quot; is most closely related to pea.

A high-quality genome sequence facilitates the application of genome editing and genomic selection for healthy, higher yielding varieties.

<doc id="184046" wikidata="Q157799" url="?curid=184046" title="Valdemar II of Denmark">
<text>Valdemar II Valdemarsen (28 June 1170 – 28 March 1241), later remembered as Valdemar the Victorious () and Valdemar the Conqueror, was King of Denmark from 1202 until his death in 1241. 

In 1207, Valdemar invaded and conquered Lybeck and Holstein, expanding the Danish territories. His involvement in the Norwegian succession led to the second Bagler War, temporarily settling the issue and making the Norwegian king owe allegiance to Denmark. He faced disputes with the papacy over the appointment of the Prince-Archbishop of Bremen and the Bishop of Schleswig. Valdemar&#x27;s military campaigns included conflicts in northern Germany and the establishment of Danish rule in Estonia in 1219. His reign saw the adoption of a feudal system in Denmark and the creation of the Code of Jutland, which served as Denmark&#x27;s legal code until 1683.

==Background==

He was the second son of King Valdemar I of Denmark and Sophia of Polotsk. When his father died, young Valdemar was only twelve years old. He was named duke of Southern Jutland (.) His regent was Bishop Valdemar Knudsen, the illegitimate son of King Canute V of Denmark. Bishop Valdemar was an ambitious man and disguised his own ambitions as young Valdemar&#x27;s. When Bishop Valdemar was named archbishop of Bremen in 1192, his plot to overthrow King Canute VI of Denmark (elder brother of Duke Valdemar) with the help of the German nobility and place himself on Denmark&#x27;s throne, was revealed.

Duke Valdemar realized the threat Bishop Valdemar represented. He thus invited him to Aabenraa in 1192. The bishop then fled to Norway to avoid arrest. The following year, Bishop Valdemar organised – supported by the Hohenstaufens – a fleet of 35 ships and harried the coasts of Denmark, claiming the Danish throne for himself based on the fact that he was the son of King Canute V. In 1193, King Canute VI captured him. Bishop Valdemar stayed in captivity in Nordborg (1193–1198) and then in the tower at Søborg Castle on Zealand until 1206. He was later released upon the initiative of Dagmar of Bohemia (the wife of Duke Valdemar) and Pope Innocent III, after swearing to never interfere again in Danish affairs.

Young Valdemar faced another threat from Count Adolf III of Holstein. Adolf tried to stir up other German counts to take southern Jutland from Denmark, and to assist Bishop Valdemar&#x27;s plot to take the Danish throne. With the bishop again in prison, Duke Valdemar went after Count Adolph, and with his own troop levies, he marched south and captured Adolph&#x27;s new fortress at Rendsburg. He defeated and captured the count at the Battle of Stellau in 1201, and imprisoned him in a cell next to Bishop Valdemar. Two years later, due to an illness, Count Adolph was able to buy his way out of prison by ceding all of Schleswig, north of the Elbe, to Duke Valdemar. In November 1202, Duke Valdemar&#x27;s elder brother, King Canute VI, unexpectedly died childless.

==Reign==

Duke Valdemar was subsequently proclaimed king at the Jutland Assembly (). The nearby Holy Roman Empire was torn by civil war due to having two rivals contesting for its throne, Otto IV, House of Guelf, and King Philip, House of Hohenstaufen. Valdemar II allied himself with Otto IV against Phillip.

In 1203 Valdemar invaded and conquered Lybeck and Holstein, adding them to the territories controlled by Denmark. In 1204 he attempted to influence the outcome of the Norwegian succession by leading a Danish fleet and army to Viken in Norway in support of Erling Steinvegg, the pretender to the Norwegian throne. This resulted in the second Bagler War which lasted until 1208. The question of the Norwegian succession was temporarily settled and the Norwegian king owed allegiance to the king of Denmark.
In 1207, a majority of Bremian capitulars again elected Bishop Valdemar as prince-archbishop, while a minority, led by the capitular provost Burkhard, Count of Stumpenhausen fled for Hamburg, being the seat of a Bremian subchapter with regional competence and delegating for episcopal elections two participants to the main Bremian chapter. The German King Philip recognised Valdemar as the legitimate prince-archbishop of Bremen, because thus the prince-archbishopric would become his ally against Valdemar II.

Valdemar II and the fled capitulars protested to Pope Innocent III, who first wanted to research the case. When Bishop Valdemar left Rome for Bremen against Pope Innocent&#x27;s order to wait his decision, he banished Valdemar by an anathema and in 1208 finally dismissed him as Bishop of Schleswig. In 1208, Burkhard, Count of Stumpenhausen, was elected by the fled capitulars in Hamburg as rival prince-archbishop and Valdemar II, usurping imperial power, invested Burkhard with the regalia – with effect only in the prince-archiepiscopal and diocesan territory north of the Elbe. In 1209 Innocent III finally consented the consecration of Bishop Nicholas I of Schleswig, a close confidant and consultant of King Valdemar, as successor of the deposed Bishop Valdemar. In 1214 King Valdemar appointed Bishop Nicholas I as Chancellor of Denmark, succeeding the late , Bishop of Roskilde.

In the same year Valdemar II invaded with Danish troops the prince-archiepiscopal territory south of the Elbe and conquered Stade. In August Prince-Archbishop Valdemar reconquered the city only to lose it soon after again to Valdemar II, who now built a bridge of the Elbe and fortified a forward post in Harburg upon Elbe. In 1209 Otto IV persuaded Valdemar II to withdraw into the north of the Elbe, urged Burkhard to resign and expelled Prince-Archbishop Valdemar.

In 1210, Innocent III made Gerhard I, Count of Oldenburg-Wildeshausen Bremen&#x27;s new Prince-Archbishop. In 1211 Duke Bernard III of the younger Duchy of Saxony escorted his brother-in-law Valdemar, the papally dismissed Prince-Archbishop, into the city of Bremen, de facto regaining the See and enjoying the sudden support of Otto IV, who meanwhile fell out with Innocent over Sicily. As a reaction Valdemar II recaptured Stade, while in 1213 Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine, conquered it for Prince-Archbishop Valdemar.

In 1213 Valdemar instituted a war tax in Norway, and the peasants murdered Valdemar&#x27;s tax collector at the Trøndelag Assembly and revolted. The uprising spread over several regions in Norway.

In 1216, Valdemar II and his Danish troops ravaged the County of Stade and conquered Hamburg. Two years later Valdemar II and Gerhard I allied to expel Henry V and Otto IV from the Prince-Archbishopric. Prince-Archbishop Valdemar finally resigned and entered into a monastery. Valdemar supported Emperor Frederick II and was rewarded with the emperor acknowledging Denmark rule of Schleswig and Holstein, all of the Wendish lands and Pomerania.

===Battle of Lindanise===

The Livonian Knights, who had been attempting to Christianize the peoples of the eastern Baltic, were (by 1219) being hard pressed and turned to Valdemar for help. Pope Honorius III elevated Valdemar&#x27;s invasion of Estonia into a crusade. Valdemar raised an army and called all of Denmark&#x27;s ships to gather to transport the army eastward. Once assembled, the fleet numbered 1500 ships.

When the army landed in Estonia, near modern-day Tallinn, the chiefs of the Estonians sat down with the Danes and agreed to acknowledge the Danish king as their overlord. A few of them allowed themselves to be baptized which seemed to be a good sign. Three days later on 15 June 1219 while the Danes were attending mass, thousands of Estonians broke into the Danish camp from all sides. Confusion reigned and things looked bad for Valdemar&#x27;s crusade. Luckily for him, Vitslav of Rügen gathered his men in a second camp and attacked the Estonians from the rear.

During the Battle of Lindanise, the legend says that whenever Bishop Sunesen raised his arms the Danes surged forward and when his arms grew tired and he let them fall the Estonians turned the Danes back. Attendants rushed forward to raise his arms once again and the Danes surged forward again. At the height of the battle Bishop Sunsen prayed for a sign and it came in the form of a red cloth with a white cross which drifted down from the sky just as the Danes began to fall back. A voice was heard to say &quot;When this banner is raised on high, you shall be victorious!&quot; The Danes surged forward and won the battle. At the end of the day thousands of Estonians lay dead on the field, and Estonia was added to the Danish realm. Estonians were forcibly baptised as Christians, but according to an in depth study of the by the historian Edgar Sachs, the Estonians quite voluntarily converted to the Christian faith.

Valdemar ordered the construction of a great fortress at Reval, near the site of the battle. Eventually a city grew around the hilltop castle which is still called Tallinn, &quot;Danish-castle/town&quot; in the Estonian language. The red banner with a white cross (&quot;Dannebrog&quot;) has been the national flag of the Danes since 1219. Dannebrog is Europe&#x27;s oldest flag design still in modern use.

===Battle of Bornhöved===
In 1223, King Valdemar and his eldest son, prince Valdemar, were abducted by Count Henry I of Schwerin (), while hunting on the island of Lyø near Funen. Count Henry demanded that Denmark surrender the land conquered in Holstein 20 years ago and become a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor. Danish envoys refused these terms and Denmark declared war. While Valdemar sat in prison, most of the German territories tore themselves away from Denmark. Danish armies were dispatched to hold them in line. The war ended in defeat of the Danish troops under the command of Albert II of Orlamünde at Mölln in 1225. To secure his release Valdemar had to acknowledge the break away territories in Germany, pay 44,000 silver marks, and sign a promise not to seek revenge on Count Henry.

Valdemar immediately appealed to Pope Honorius III to have his oath declared void, a request granted by the Pope. Honorius III excused Valdemar from his forced oath, and he immediately set about trying to restore the German territories. Valdemar concluded a treaty with his nephew Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and headed south to take back what he thought were his lands by right, but his luck deserted him. A series of Danish defeats culminating in the Battle of Bornhöved on 22 July 1227 cemented the loss of Denmark&#x27;s north German territories. Valdemar himself was saved only by the chivalrous acts of a German knight who carried Valdemar to safety on his horse.

===Code of Jutland===
From that time on, King Valdemar II focused his efforts on domestic affairs. One of the changes he instituted was the feudal system, where he gave properties to men with the understanding that they owed him service in return. This increased the power of the noble families () and gave rise to the lesser nobles (), who controlled most of Denmark. Free peasants lost the traditional rights and privileges they had enjoyed since the Viking era.

King Valdemar II spent the remainder of his life putting together a code of laws for Jutland, Zealand, and Skåne. These codes were used as Denmark&#x27;s legal code until 1683. This was a significant change from the local law-making at the regional assemblies (), which had been a long-standing tradition. Several methods of determining guilt or innocence were outlawed, including trial by ordeal and trial by combat. The Code of Jutland () was approved at the meeting of the nobility at Vordingborg Castle in 1241, just prior to Valdemar&#x27;s death there. Valdemar was buried next to his first wife, Queen Dagmar, at Ringsted in Zealand.

==Marriages==
Before his first marriage, Valdemar had been betrothed to Rixa of Bavaria, daughter of the Duke of Saxony. When that arrangement failed, he married first Dagmar of Bohemia, also known as Margaret of Bohemia, in 1205. She was the daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia by his first wife, Adelaide of Meissen, and soon became popular with the Danes. By this marriage, Valdemar had a son, Valdemar the Young, whom he elevated as co-king at Schleswig in 1218. Valdemar the Young was accidentally shot while hunting at Refsnæs in North Jutland in 1231. Queen Dagmar died in childbirth in 1212. Old folk ballads say that on her death bed, she begged Valdemar to marry Kirsten, the daughter of Karl von Rise, and not the &quot;beautiful flower&quot;, Berengaria of Portugal (&quot;Bengerd&quot;). In other words, she predicted Berengaria&#x27;s sons&#x27; fight over the throne would bring trouble to Denmark.

After Dagmar&#x27;s death, in order to build good relations with Flanders, Valdemar married Berengária of Portugal in 1214. She was the orphan daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal and Dulce of Aragon, and a sister of Ferdinand, Count of Flanders, with whom she stayed until her marriage. Queen Berengária was beautiful, but so hard-hearted that she was generally hated by the Danes until her early death, in childbirth, in 1221. Valdemar&#x27;s two wives played a prominent role in Danish ballads and myths – Dagmar as the soft, pious, and popular ideal wife, and Berengária as the beautiful and haughty woman.

===Issue===
With his first wife, Dagmar of Bohemia, whom he wed in 1205, Valdamar had the following children:

== Legacy ==
Valdemar enjoys a central position in Danish history because of his position as &quot;the king of Dannebrog&quot; and as a legislator. To posterity, the civil wars and dissolution that followed his death made him appear to be the last king of a golden age. Since 1912, June 15 has officially been called (&quot;Valdemar&#x27;s Day&quot;). The date now belongs to the group of 33 Danish annual &quot;Flag Days&quot; where &quot;Dannebrog&quot; is raised in celebration.

The 1997 film &quot;Eye of the Eagle&quot; was about a fictional story about Valdemar the Young. His father Valdemar was played by Lars Lohmann. 

The Estonian capital Tallinn has a park at Toompea called the Danish King&#x27;s Garden where the Danish flag &quot;Dannebrog&quot; was born according to prevailing legends. Every year on 15 June, the &quot;Day of the Danish Flag&quot; is celebrated in the garden.

<text>Aralia elata, also known as the Japanese angelica tree, Chinese angelica-tree, or Korean angelica-tree, is a species of woody plant in the family Araliaceae native to eastern Asia (in Russia, China, Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan).

==Description==
It is an upright deciduous small tree or shrub growing up to in height.

The bark is rough and gray with prickles. The leaves are alternate, large, 60–120 cm long, and double pinnate. The flowers are produced in large umbels in late summer, each flower small and white. The fruit is a small black drupe.

&quot;Aralia elata&quot; is closely related to the American species &quot;Aralia spinosa&quot;, with which it is easily confused. &quot;A. elata&quot; can be differentiated by having its inflorescence on a horizontal axis.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Aralia elata&quot; is cultivated, often in a variegated form, for its exotic appearance. It prefers deep loamy soils in partial shade, but will grow in poorer soils and in full sun. The cultivars &#x27;Variegata&#x27; and &#x27;Aureovariegata&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

== Culinary uses ==

=== Japan ===

In Japan, the shoots are eaten in the spring. They are picked from the end of the branches and are commonly fried in a tempura batter. They can also be blanched or stir fried, among other methods.

=== Korea ===

In Korea, young shoots are harvested during a month, from early April to early May, when they are soft and fragrant. In Korean cuisine, the shoots are commonly eaten blanched, pickled, pan-fried, or deep-fried.

==Invasive species==

The tree was introduced into the United States in 1830. Birds like to eat the fruits, and are spreading its seeds, allowing the tree to expand its range as an invasive species in the northeastern United States.

<text>Chiltern Railways (legal name The Chiltern Railway Company Limited) is a British train operating company that has operated the Chiltern Railways franchise since July 1996. Since 2009, it has been a subsidiary of Arriva UK Trains.

Chiltern Railways was founded as M40 Trains by a group of ex-British Rail managers backed by John Laing and 3i; in June 1996, it was announced that M40 Trains had been awarded the Chiltern Railways franchise. On 21 July 1996, it took over operations from British Rail. The company promptly commenced the redoubling of the Chiltern Main Line under the &quot;Evergreen&quot; initiative and ordered the Class 168 &quot;Clubman&quot; diesel multiple units (DMUs) to supplement its ex-British Rail fleet. Following the awarding of a 20-year franchise to Chiltern Railways in August 2000, Evergreen phase 2 works begun to raise line speeds around , built two new platforms at its London Marylebone terminus. In January 2010, a £250 million upgrade package was agreed for Evergreen phase 3, remodelling the line and permitting 100 mph operations, thus greatly reducing journey times.

In August 2002, the John Laing Group became the sole owner of Chiltern Railways after buying out all other shareholders; shortly after John Laing&#x27;s purchase by Henderson Equity Partners, the company was sold to the German publicly owned railway company Deutsche Bahn in January 2008. Chiltern Railways became a subsidiary of Arriva UK Trains as a result of restructuring during early 2011. Around this time, Chiltern was considered one of the best railway operators in Britain, with Public performance measure (PPM) regularly over 90%. However, the introduction of new timetables during the 2010s was repeatedly received negatively by the travelling public. Severe disruption to Chiltern&#x27;s services occurred following the collapse of Gerrards Cross Tunnel on 30 June 2005; an unplanned six week closure of the main line was forced, resulting in compensation being paid by Tesco (which planned to build a supermarket over the tunnel) to both Chiltern Railways and Network Rail.

Chiltern Railways operates commuter/regional rail passenger services from its central London terminus at Marylebone along the M40 corridor to destinations in Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire (King&#x27;s Sutton) and Warwickshire, as well as long-distance services to the West Midlands along two routes. Services on the Chiltern Main Line run from London to , and , with some peak-hour services extended to . Chiltern Railways also runs trains on the London–Aylesbury line to (some of which continue on to ), and on the Princes Risborough to Aylesbury and Oxford to Bicester branch lines. From December 2010, Chiltern began operating the &quot;Chiltern Mainline&quot; service of two peak-hour locomotive-hauled services consisting of a hauling a rake of modernised Mark 3 coaches and a Driving Van Trailer.

==History==
Chiltern Railways originated with a number of former British Rail managers who sought to conduct a management buyout on one of the soon-to-be-created rail franchises that would be produced as a part of the privatisation of British Rail. In April 1995, they were granted a licence by the railway regulator. However, the team recognised that they lacked the resources to successfully pursue a bid, thus they secured the backing of the infrastructure investment group John Laing and the venture capital specialist 3i.

In October 1995, M40 Trains was established; the various railway managers held a combined 51% shareholding in the business, while the John Laing Group and 3i held 26% and 23% stakes respectively. The company reportedly spent £38 million in its bid for the Chiltern Railways franchise. In June 1996, the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising awarded the franchise to M40 Trains for an initial period of seven years. It was the only franchise operator to have as many as 51% of its shares controlled by its directors.

On 21 July 1996, the company commenced operations, taking over from the publicly owned British Rail. Chiltern Railways was the first railway franchise to order new rolling stock in the post-privatisation era in the form of the Class 168 &quot;Clubman&quot; diesel multiple units (DMUs). However, their introduction was marred by unreliability, in part due to their rushed entry into service in response to booming passenger demand. By April 1999, the company claimed to employ 50% more staff than it had at the start of the franchise, and to be running 25% more services than had been operated by British Rail. Meanwhile, under the terms of the franchise agreement, the annual subsidy provided by the British government was gradually reduced.

During early 1999, the ownership of M40 Trains underwent substantial changes; the John Laing Group opted to increase its shareholding in the venture to 84% via the purchase of shares from their previous holders; the outstanding 16% of shares were owned by several members of the former British Rail management team.

In March 2000, the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority announced that both M40 Trains and the British transport group Go-Ahead had been shortlisted to bid for the next Chiltern franchise. In August 2000, M40 Trains was awarded the new franchise, which was set to run for 20 years, conditional on various investments being made across that period. On 3 March 2002, the new franchise period began.

In August 2002, John Laing acquired the remaining 16% of shares in M40 Trains that it did not already own. In September 2006, John Laing was purchased by the global investment firm Henderson Equity Partners in exchange for £887 million.

During December 2004, Chiltern Railways took over operation of passenger services on the to branch line from First Great Western Link. In June 2006, M40 Trains was invited by the Department for Transport (DfT) to lodge a bid to operate the Snow Hill Lines, then operated by Central Trains, as part of the letting of the West Midlands franchise. However, this bid was not successful.

During mid-2005, Chiltern Railways&#x27; services were heavily disrupted by the collapse of Gerrards Cross Tunnel. In 1996, the British retailer Tesco sought to build a supermarket near Gerrards Cross railway station; despite the local council&#x27;s initial objection to the scheme, it was approved by the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott in July 1998. Due to a lack of available space, Tesco started building a tunnel over the active railway line to provide suitable land for the development. On 30 June 2005, the partially-constructed tunnel collapsed; nobody was injured, but a complete closure of the line was enacted for over six weeks before being permitted to reopen on 20 August 2005. Tesco paid an estimated £200million of compensation to both Chiltern Railways and Network Rail for the disruption; the retailer also pledged to fund a media campaign to win back passengers lost by the route&#x27;s unplanned closure. The tunnel&#x27;s construction resumed in January 2009. In late November 2010, the completed store was opened.

In July 2007, Henderson Equity Partners announced its intention to sell on Laing Rail along with the Chiltern Railways franchise. Amongst the parties to express interest in acquiring the company were the transport groups Arriva and Go-Ahead. However, by December 2007, only the German publicly owned railway company Deutsche Bahn and the Dutch transport company NedRail reportedly remained in the bidding contest. In January 2008, Laing Rail was purchased by Deutsche Bahn; accordingly Chiltern Railways became a part of the DB Regio group. During early 2011, the company was restructured, with DB Regio becoming a subsidiary of Arriva UK Trains.

During May 2011, Chiltern took over operating services on the Oxford–Bicester line from First Great Western. On 26 October 2015, the company opened two new stations, Oxford Parkway and Bicester Village, providing services between north Oxford and London Marylebone. In December 2016, Chiltern Railways started running train services from Oxford to London Marylebone.

In 2021, following the COVID-19 emergency measures, Chiltern was awarded a new direct contract by the DfT, replacing its franchise agreement, with a core term until 1 April 2025 and expiring on 12 December 2027.

Chiltern Railways is one of several train operators impacted by the 2022–2024 United Kingdom railway strikes, the first national rail strike in the UK for three decades. Its workers were amongst those are participating in industrial action due to a dispute over pay and working conditions.

On 21 October 2024 Chiltern Railways, along with Great Western Railway began testing trains on the full route of stage 1 of East West Rail between and , ahead of its 2025 opening.

==Services==
Chiltern Railways operates regular services on five routes.

The Chiltern Main Line is the core route for the majority of Chiltern Railways services and is one of two &quot;mainline routes&quot; operated by the company. The route links the major cities of London and Birmingham (Marylebone and Moor Street stations respectively), passing through the towns of High Wycombe, Banbury, Royal Leamington Spa, Warwick and Solihull. Chiltern Railways operates trains along the entire line, services ranging from stopping suburban trains (e.g. London Marylebone – Gerrards Cross) to express trains running the full length of the line between London and Birmingham. The fastest timetabled journey from Birmingham to London by this route is 99minutes (compared with 82minutes using Avanti West Coast services between Birmingham New Street and London Euston via the West Coast Main Line). In addition to the Chiltern Railways services, CrossCountry also operates regular services on the line north of Banbury, and West Midlands Trains operates regular services north of Dorridge.

The London–Aylesbury line is the second &quot;mainline route&quot; operated by the company. The route links London (Marylebone) with Aylesbury via Amersham. All Chiltern Railways services on this route run the full length of the line between Marylebone and Aylesbury stations and call at all stations north of Amersham; most trains are extended one station further to Aylesbury Vale Parkway. The line runs alongside London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line between (just north of Marylebone station) and Harrow-on-the-Hill, each operator running on separate tracks. Beyond Harrow-on-the-Hill, the tracks are shared between Chiltern Railways and Metropolitan line services. This is an example of National Rail services using non-Network Rail tracks, and it uses a unique unregulated track-access agreement with London Underground. Beyond Amersham (where the Metropolitan line terminates), all services are operated by Chiltern Railways only.

The other three routes regularly served by the company are all branch lines. The Aylesbury–Princes Risborough line links Princes Risborough, on the Chiltern Main Line, with Aylesbury, on the London to Aylesbury Line. Most trains on the line continue beyond Princes Risborough to London Marylebone, which gives Aylesbury an alternative route to reach central London; however, a few services terminate at Princes Risborough. The Oxford–Bicester line branches off the Chiltern Main Line just south of Bicester and links the town with Oxford. The line is mostly served by express services to and from Marylebone. Until December 2016, the line terminated a few miles northeast of Oxford, at the nearby Oxford Parkway station; the line was then extended to the main Oxford station. The Leamington–Stratford line branches off the Chiltern Main Line at Hatton (a few miles west of Leamington Spa) and runs to Stratford-upon-Avon. The branch line is also operated by regular West Midlands Trains services.

As of May 2023, a simplified description of the routes served off-peak Monday to Friday are as follows:


===Parliamentary trains===
Chiltern Railways operates two parliamentary train services:
* &quot;Cherwell Valley line&quot;: there is a single daily parliamentary service operating on the Cherwell Valley line from to Banbury, operated by Chiltern Railways. This service runs on Tuesdays to Saturdays just after midnight and calls at , and - the three intermediate stations on the line. There is no corresponding return service heading towards Oxford. This service exists to maintain route knowledge for Chiltern Railways&#x27; drivers. Regular services on the line are operated by Great Western Railway and CrossCountry.
* &quot;New North Main line/Greenford branch line&quot;: the company also operated a weekday parliamentary service to and from in the late morning. Until December 2018, these services ran to and from . They were then diverted to West Ealing following closure of the easternmost section of the New North Main line for High Speed 2 construction. The parliamentary service used to run a return service, with the returning service terminating at High Wycombe. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the service was suspended until December 2021. , the service no longer runs and has been replaced by a bus service.

===Buckinghamshire Railway Centre===
On certain Bank Holiday Mondays, services are extended from Aylesbury to the Buckinghamshire Railway Heritage Centre facilities at , a short way north of . However, this did not happen in 2019 and their future is uncertain. The link will continue to be used by freight services to Calvert.

==Tickets==

Since winning the franchise, Chiltern has introduced &quot;Route: High Wycombe&quot; tickets for the Chiltern route between Birmingham and London that are considerably cheaper than &quot;Route: Any Permitted&quot; tickets, valid on the faster Avanti West Coast service to London Euston as well a number of other operators and routes. Chiltern offers only standard class, not standard and First Class as on Avanti services.

Until January 2022, Chiltern offered a premium economy &quot;Business Zone&quot; carriage on their Class 68 loco-hauled services between Birmingham or Oxford and London. Passengers would pay an upgrade fee to sit in a larger first-class-style seat; and formerly, this upgrade came with complimentary refreshments but, since May 2017, refreshment services have been cut on all Chiltern Railways services, meaning the &quot;Business Zone&quot; no longer comes with complimentary refreshments.

From January 2022, Business Zone is no longer offered, and the former Business Zone carriage can be used by any customers holding a valid ticket to travel at no extra cost.

==Performance==

Chiltern Railways&#x27; early operations were subject to considerable criticism. During 1998, its poor performance figures in criteria such as reliability, punctuality, and customer approval has led to financial penalties being incurred by the company, some of which was in the form of refunds to its passengers.

By the mid-2010s, Chiltern was considered one of the best railway operators in Britain, with Public Performance Measure (PPM) regularly over 90%, until the introduction of changes in November 2015, and infrastructure issues saw punctuality fall to 86% in December 2015. Chiltern&#x27;s PPM is measured on stricter conditions than its long-distance rivals, such as Avanti West Coast, as Chiltern has a five-minute window for performance while others have a ten-minute window.

Performance figures published by Network Rail rate Chiltern Railways sixth in train operating companies in the UK at 89.4% (PPM – period 9) and 94.3% (MAA) for the year to 12 December 2015.

A new timetable introduced in September 2011, combined with significant disruption caused by engineering work, caused a negative reaction from customers. A petition to have the service reviewed was started, and articles describing the disrupted journeys of commuters appeared in the local press.

A new timetable introduced in December 2012 also met with frustration and opposition from some customers, particularly those using Saunderton and Princes Risborough stations.

==Project Evergreen==
Evergreen is the name given by Chiltern to the major infrastructure works that the company has committed to over the 20-year duration of its franchise to improve routes and services. This has been divided into three distinct phases.

===Evergreen 1===
The main focus of phase 1 was the redoubling of the Chiltern Main Line between and , with work taking place during 1998, as well as between Bicester North and Aynho Junction during 2001. Furthermore, several stations were subject to reconstruction works. was rebuilt to have two operational platforms instead of a single platform; a new platform was also installed at . Finally, the line speed limit was raised following appropriate infrastructure improvements.

===Evergreen 2===
Phase 2 commenced shortly following the award of Chiltern&#x27;s 20-year franchise period in August 2000. The most extensive works undertaken was the realignment of the route through , which permitted line speeds to be increased to . Further improvements in this phase included the enactment of signalling improvements between High Wycombe and Bicester, as well as between Princes Risborough and Aylesbury, two new platforms were constructed at London Marylebone on land formerly occupied by the carriage sidings, while a new depot was constructed at Wembley.

===Evergreen 3===
The DfT, Chiltern Railways and Network Rail agreed in January 2010 to a £250million upgrade of the Chiltern Main Line.

====Phase 1====
Phase 1 of the project, now complete, involved upgrading the Marylebone – Birmingham Chiltern Main Line to permit running on an additional of route. Junctions at Neasden, Northolt and Aynho were remodelled to permit higher speeds. The &#x27;up&#x27; through track has been restored at , the existing &#x27;up&#x27; line becoming a platform loop, a new turnback siding has been provided at , and a new, straighter &#x27;down&#x27; through track built from Northolt Junction (where the original layout favoured the now little-used Paddington route) to Ruislip Gardens. The existing &#x27;down&#x27; track continues to serve station. The former speed restrictions through have been removed to permit 100mph running. Two additional terminating platforms at Birmingham Moor Street were reopened in December 2010. Accelerated services were initially planned to start in May 2011, but there were delays and it was not until 5 September 2011 that Chiltern was able to introduce a new timetable to take advantage of the improvements.

As a result of the speed increases, journey times have been reduced significantly. From Marylebone, the fastest peak-hour journey time to Birmingham Moor Street is now 90minutes, instead of 117minutes previously. Chiltern Railways former chairman Adrian Shooter stated: &quot;This is the biggest passenger rail project for several generations not to call on the taxpayer for support. Working closely with Network Rail, we are going to create a new main-line railway for the people of Oxfordshire and the Midlands. This deal demonstrates that real improvements to rail services can be paid for without public subsidy by attracting people out of their cars and on to trains.&quot;

The table below outlines the peak timetable improvements.

====Phase 2====

During October 2012, the Secretary of State for Transport granted permission for work to begin on Phase 2 of the Evergreen 3 project, with services between London Marylebone and Oxford. Under Phase 2, a quarter-of-a-mile double track has been constructed joining the Oxford–Bicester line at to the Chiltern Main Line, allowing a new Oxford to London Marylebone service to operate. A new station, , has been constructed at Water Eaton; the service between Oxford Parkway and London started on 26 October 2015, with the link from Oxford Parkway to becoming operational on 12 December 2016. All signalling on the route (including the new platforms at Oxford) is controlled by the Marylebone Signalling Centre.

As part of Phase 2, the Oxford to Bicester Village service transferred from First Great Western to Chiltern in May 2011. Part of the line between Wolvercote Tunnel (on the outskirts of Oxford) and Bicester Village was restored to double track, and the scheme included additional platforms at Oxford, and Bicester Village.

Network Rail provided the capital for the upgrade and will recover this through a facility charge over the subsequent 30 years, initially payable by Chiltern until its franchise expires, and then by the next franchisee. The infrastructure upgrade was carried out by main contractor BAM Nuttall, in partnership with Jarvis and WS Atkins.

Oxfordshire County Council supported the scheme, but required convincing of the benefits of the new Oxford Parkway station at Water Eaton, which is in the Green Belt. In November 2011, there was a further setback to the project when a planning inspector withheld approval due to the discovery of bats roosting in Wolvercote Tunnel. Great crested newts also had a breeding habitat close to the route. In early 2012, the &quot;bat problem&quot; was apparently resolved.

===Post-Evergreen plans===
In addition to the completed Evergreen initiatives, other potential enhancements for Chiltern&#x27;s route have been discussed, but had not progressed as at the end of 2017. These include:
* Upgrading the Acton–Northolt line (formerly the &quot;New North Main Line&quot;) to new platforms at . This upgrade will also extend to to increase capacity on the Chiltern Main Line as there is no room to expand the station at Marylebone.
* Restoration of fast through lines at Beaconsfield as part of a longer-term aspiration for a 90-minute journey time between London and Birmingham.
* Remodelling Banbury Station and tracks.
* Building of the West Hampstead interchange to allow easy interchange with the London Overground - North London Line, Jubilee line, Metropolitan line and Thameslink services.
* New Chiltern Metro Service that would operate more than four trains per hour for Wembley Stadium, Sudbury &amp; Harrow Road, Sudbury Hill Harrow, Northolt Park, South Ruislip and West Ruislip. This would require a reversing facility at West Ruislip, passing loops at Sudbury Hill Harrow, and a passing loop at Wembley Stadium (part of the old down fast line is in use as a central reversing siding, for stock movements and additionally for eight-car football shuttles to convey passengers to the stadium for events). This &#x27;Chiltern Metro&#x27; service was not programmed into the last round of franchising agreements.
* Re-opening the passenger line between and as part of the East West Rail project, and from to East West Rail at Claydon LNE Junction to provide a route to Milton Keynes and the West Coast Main Line via . Two miles of the line north of Aylesbury re-opened on 14 December 2008, terminating at a new station, . However, during late 2017, the Government announced that the private company, East West Rail Company, had been formed to build and operate the line exclusively.
* Opening a rail line from Aylesbury to an M6-M1 Parkway Station near Rugby.
* Extending Oyster Pay-as-you-go to and . Extension of Contactless to High Wycombe took place in June 2024.

Since successful completion of Project Evergreen 3 has fulfilled Chiltern Railways&#x27; obligation to invest in infrastructure, there is no clear road to completion for these projects.

==Rolling stock==

Chiltern Railways inherited a fleet of 34 Class 165 &quot;Turbos&quot; diesel multiple units (DMUs) from British Rail. From the franchise&#x27;s onset in July 1996, the company publicly promised to introduce new rolling stock. During December 2004, a further five Class 165s were transferred from First Great Western Link. Between 2003 and 2005, all 39 Class 165s were overhauled by Bombardier at Ilford EMU Depot; during this work, air conditioning units were installed throughout the fleet, while the hopper opening windows were removed; a first-class seating area was also implemented. As the fleet had been designed for suburban use, rather than InterCity travel, the Class 165s tend to be concentrated on services to Aylesbury and Banbury, although this stock can also be found operating the service between Birmingham and Leamington Spa.

Chiltern ordered several batches of Class 168 &quot;Clubman&quot; DMUs. Between 1998 and 2004, these entered revenue service, the company eventually operated nine three-car and ten four-car sets. These operate across the network.

During April 2003, Chiltern restored a single Class 121 &quot;Bubble Car&quot; for use on the to shuttles. In May 2011, a second Class 121 followed after being overhauled at Tyseley TMD. During March 2013, a third Class 121 (121032) was acquired from Arriva Trains Wales for use as a spare parts donor. On 19 May 2017, the Chiltern Bubble cars ran for the last time, as their age made spare parts increasingly difficult to obtain.

In January 2008, Chiltern ordered four two-coach Class 172 &quot;Turbostars&quot;; these entered service during June 2011. Because they cannot be fitted with the tripcock safety equipment necessary to operate on London Underground lines, none of the Class 172s can operate via unless attached to a Class 165 or Class 168 DMU. Although initially intended for use on all-stations services out of London, they frequently operated as far afield as Birmingham. During mid-2021, all of Chiltern&#x27;s Class 172s were leased to West Midlands Trains for use with their existing Class 172 fleet pending the delivery of British Rail Class 196 DMUs. In December 2021, it was later announced that the Class 172/1 fleet would not be returning to Chiltern once the Class 196s enter service with WMT.

Starting in December 2010, Chiltern began operating two peak-hour loco-hauled services consisting of a Class 67 diesel locomotive hauling a rake of Mark 3 coaches and a Driving Van Trailer. A single set was initially hired from fellow DB Regio subsidiary Wrexham &amp; Shropshire to operate a Birmingham Moor Street to London Marylebone service while another was made up of some DB-Regio-owned Mark 3s painted in British Rail blue/grey and Virgin Trains livery and operated from to London Marylebone.

After Wrexham &amp; Shropshire ceased operations in January 2011, Chiltern started using a second ex-Wrexham &amp; Shropshire set from May 2011. For the introduction of Chiltern&#x27;s new timetable in September 2011, these sets had a &quot;Mainline&quot; logo and blue stripes added to their silver livery. Motive power continued to be provided by several Class 67s, including 67010, 67012-015 and 67018, all of which had been modified to operate with Driving Van Trailers.

During 2012, the ex-Wrexham &amp; Shropshire Mark 3 coaches were overhauled and fitted with sliding plug doors (similar to those fitted to South West Trains&#x27; Class 444 &quot;Desiros&quot;) and toilet retention tanks by Wabtec&#x27;s Doncaster Works. Once this work was completed, a further ten Mark 3s were overhauled by Wabtec to create a fifth set and to extend the existing sets up to six coaches. In 2012, the DB-Regio-owned Mark 3s used on the peak-hour Banbury service were given a light overhaul at LNWR, Bristol, and the Virgin-liveried examples repainted into British Rail blue/grey. To allow Class 168s to be cascaded to the new Oxford services as part of Evergreen 3, more Mark 3s are to be returned to service in the future.

Between 2015 and 2016, Class 170 &quot;Turbostars&quot; with First TransPennine Express transferred to Chiltern Railways. Chiltern took five of the First TransPennine Class 170s from May 2015 and the remaining four in July 2016. Upon delivery, the Class 170s were modified to allow them to be used with Chiltern&#x27;s existing Class 168s, and reclassified as Class 168/3s.

In early 2014, Chiltern Railways agreed a sub-lease from Direct Rail Services (DRS) for six Class 68 locomotives for use on its London Marylebone to Birmingham service to replace the existing fleet of Class 67s. Maintenance and commissioning for the new fleet is assisted by DRS.

During 2017, Chiltern Railways entered into an agreement with Artemis Intelligent Power and the Rail Safety and Standards Board to provide one of its redundant DVTs as a donor vehicle for conversion into a new type of diesel locomotive.

In July 2021, Chiltern Railways converted a single Class 168 unit (168329) into a Battery Hybrid train, referred to as &quot;HybridFlex&quot;; during February 2022, it was first run on services between London and Aylesbury. The company promoted the HybridFlex as increasing acceleration while reducing fuel consumption, vibration, and noise emissions, along with lessening the environmental impact of rail travel.

In August 2023, Chiltern Railways issued a tender for new trains.

In October 2024, the first of newly refurbished Class 168 units ran in passenger service for the first time. This £12million refurbishment, which will carry on for the full fleet during 2025, includes a heavy maintenance baseline including battery and air system overhauls, repainting the exterior of the units, upgrading the interior passenger environment, a new Wi-Fi system, installation of USB charging sockets, improvements to the fleet&#x27;s reliability, an overhaul of the heating and cooling system, new seat cushions and covers, new carpets, and new lighting.

<text>The Red Arrows, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, is the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force (RAF) based at RAF Waddington. The team was formed in late 1964 as an all-Royal Air Force team, replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by RAF commands.

The Red Arrows have a prominent place in British popular culture, with their aerobatic displays a fixture of British summer events. The badge of the Red Arrows shows the aircraft in their trademark diamond nine formation, with the motto &quot;Éclat&quot;, a French word meaning &quot;brilliance&quot; or &quot;excellence&quot;.

The four published roles of the Red Arrows are:

* Representing and showcasing the skills and values of the Royal Air Force
* Supporting British industry
* Assisting in defence diplomacy
* Aiding recruitment for the UK Armed Forces

Initially, they were equipped with seven Folland Gnat trainers inherited from the RAF Yellowjacks display team. This aircraft was chosen because it was less expensive to operate than front-line fighters. In their first season, they flew at 65 shows across Europe. In 1966, the team was increased to nine members, enabling them to develop their &quot;Diamond Nine&quot; formation. In late 1979, they switched to the BAE Hawk trainer. The Red Arrows have performed over 4,800 displays in 57 countries worldwide.

The team is currently and publicly celebrating their 60th Diamond Season in 2024, with an anniversary decal applied to the fuselage and fin, as well as a special &#x27;anniversary break&#x27; manoeuvre being included in the display.

==History==

===Predecessors===
The Red Arrows were not the first RAF aerobatics team. An RAF pageant was held at Hendon in 1920 with teams from front-line biplane squadrons.

In 1925, No. 32 Squadron RAF flew an air display six nights a week entitled &quot;London Defended&quot; at the British Empire Exhibition. Similar to the display they had done the previous year, when the aircraft were painted black, it consisted of a night-time air display over the Wembley Exhibition flying RAF Sopwith Snipes which were painted red for the display and fitted with white lights on the wings, tail, and fuselage. The display involved firing blank ammunition into the stadium crowds and dropping pyrotechnics from the aeroplanes to simulate shrapnel from guns on the ground. Explosions on the ground also produced the effect of bombs being dropped into the stadium by the aeroplanes. One of the pilots in the display was Flying Officer C. W. A. Scott, who later became famous for breaking three England–Australia solo flight records and winning the MacRobertson Air Race with co-pilot Tom Campbell Black in 1934.

In 1947, the first jet team of three de Havilland Vampires came from RAF Odiham Fighter Wing. Various teams flew the Vampire, and in 1950, No. 72 Squadron was flying a team of seven. No. 54 Squadron became the first RAF jet formation team to use smoke trails. Vampires were replaced by Gloster Meteors, No. 66 Squadron developing a formation team of six aircraft.

Hawker Hunter aircraft were first used for aerobatics teams in 1955, when No. 54 Squadron flew a formation of four.

The official RAF team was provided by No. 111 Squadron in 1956, and for the first time, the aircraft had a special colour scheme, which was an all-black finish. After a demonstration in France, they were hailed as &quot;Les Fleches Noires&quot; and from then on known as the Black Arrows. This team became the first team to fly a five-Hunter formation. In 1958, the Black Arrows performed a loop and barrel roll of 22 Hunters, a world record for the greatest number of aircraft looped in formation. The Black Arrows were the premier team until 1961, when the Blue Diamonds (No. 92 Squadron) continued their role, flying 16 blue Hunters.

In 1960, the Tigers (No. 74 Squadron) were re-equipped with the supersonic English Electric Lightning and performed wing-overs and rolls with nine aircraft in tight formation. They sometimes gave co-ordinated displays with the Blue Diamonds. Yet another aerobatics team was formed in 1960 by No. 56 Squadron, the Firebirds, with nine red and silver Lightnings.

In 1964, the Red Pelicans, flying six BAC Jet Provost T Mk 4s, assumed the role of the RAF&#x27;s leading display team. In that same year, a team of five yellow Gnat trainers from No 4 Flying Training School displayed at the Farnborough Airshow. This team became known as the Yellowjacks after Flight Lieutenant Lee Jones&#x27;s call sign, &quot;Yellowjack&quot;.

In 1964, all the RAF display teams were amalgamated, as it was feared pilots were spending too much time practising formation aerobatics rather than operational training. The new team name took the word &quot;red&quot; from the fact that the Red Pelicans&#x27; planes had been painted red (for safety reasons, as it was a far clearer and more visible colour in the sky) and &quot;arrows&quot; after the Black Arrows.

===Establishment===
The Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the formal name of the Red Arrows, began life at RAF Little Rissington in Gloucestershire, then the Central Flying School before moving to RAF Fairford. The Red Arrows moved to RAF Kemble, now Cotswold Airport, in 1966 after RAF Fairford became the place of choice for BAC to run test flights for the Concorde supersonic airliner. When RAF Scampton (near Lincoln) became the CFS headquarters in 1983, the Red Arrows moved there. As an economy measure, Scampton closed in 1995, so the Red Arrows moved to RAF Cranwell; however, as they still used the air space above Scampton, the emergency facilities and runways had to be maintained. On 21 December 2000, the Red Arrows returned to RAF Scampton. On 13 October 2022, the Red Arrows moved to their new base at RAF Waddington.
The first team, led by Flight Lieutenant Lee Jones, had seven display pilots and flew the Folland Gnat T1 jet trainer. The first display in the UK was on 6 May 1965, at Little Rissington for a press day. At the subsequent National Air Day display, three days later, at Clermont Ferrand in France, one French journalist described the team as &quot;Les Fleches Rouges&quot;, confirming the name &quot;The Red Arrows&quot;. By the end of their first season, the Red Arrows had displayed 65 times in Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium and were awarded the Britannia Trophy by the Royal Aero Club for their contribution to aviation.

In 1968, the then team leader (Sqn Ldr Ray Hanna) expanded the team from seven to nine jets, as he wanted to expand the team&#x27;s capabilities and the permutations of formation patterns. During this season, the &#x27;Diamond Nine&#x27; pattern was formed and it has remained the team&#x27;s trademark pattern ever since. Ray Hanna served as Red Leader for three consecutive years until 1968 and was recalled to supersede Squadron Leader Timothy Nelson for the 1969 display season, a record four seasons as Leader, which still stands. For his considerable achievements of airmanship with the team, Ray Hanna was awarded a bar to his existing Air Force Cross.

After displaying 1,292 times in the Folland Gnat, the Red Arrows took delivery of the BAE Hawk in 1979. Since being introduced into service with the Red Arrows, the Hawk has performed with the Red Arrows in 50 countries.

===Later years===

In July 2004, speculation surfaced in the British media that the Red Arrows would be disbanded, after a defence spending review, due to running costs between £5 million and £6 million. The Arrows were not disbanded and their expense has been justified through their public relations benefit of helping to develop business in the defence industry and promoting recruitment for the RAF. According to the BBC, disbanding the Red Arrows will be highly unlikely, as they are a considerable attraction throughout the world. This was reiterated by Prime Minister David Cameron on 20 February 2013, when he guaranteed the estimated £9m per annum costs while visiting India to discuss a possible sale of Hawk aircraft to be used by India&#x27;s military aerobatics team, the Surya Kiran.

With the planned closure of RAF Scampton, the future home of the Red Arrows became uncertain. On 20 May 2008, months of speculation were ended when it was revealed that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) were moving the Red Arrows to nearby RAF Waddington. However, in December 2011, those plans were put under review. The MoD confirmed in June 2012 that the Red Arrows would remain at RAF Scampton until at least the end of the decade. Scampton&#x27;s runway was resurfaced as a result.

In July 2018 the RAF announced that RAF Scampton, the wartime base of No. 617 Squadron also known as &quot;The Dambusters&quot;, would close by 2022. In March 2019, the MoD indicated that RAF Waddington, alongside RAF Leeming and RAF Wittering, was being considered as their future home. It was confirmed in May 2020 that Waddington had been selected. The move was completed on 13 October 2022. The Red Arrows will continue to use airspace above RAF Scampton for their training.

===Misconduct inquiry===
In December 2021, Chief of the Air Staff Mike Wigston ordered an RAF inquiry into the Red Arrows, which &quot;The Times&quot; later reported related to allegations of bullying, misogyny, sexual harassment and drunkenness. Up to 40 personnel on the squadron, many of whom were female, described the culture as &quot;toxic&quot;. While the inquiry was ongoing some pilots left, leaving a smaller display team. An inquiry delivered in November 2022 concluded that at least two pilots from the team had enough of a service case against them to warrant their discharge from the service. In November 2022 it was announced that the commanding officer had been suspended for investigations. The whole team were required to attend courses on &quot;unacceptable behaviour&quot; and &quot;active bystander&quot; training after one former female member claimed that newly arrived females on the team were seen as &quot;fresh meat&quot;, and would be inundated with unwanted WhatsApp messages.

A further formal investigation into the command, leadership, and management of the squadron was conducted in 2023, and redacted versions of both reports were published on 1 November 2023. Chief of the Air Staff Sir Richard Knighton apologised and stated &quot;I was appalled when I read the investigations&#x27; findings&quot; and that few serving at that time were still in the squadron and he had confidence in the current command. Four of the victims who made formal complainants subsequently criticised the inquiry in a &quot;Sky News&quot; documentary, and stated that the RAF had falsely told a parliamentary committee that the sexism allegations did not meet a criminal threshold.

==Pilots==
Since 1966, the team has had nine display pilots each year, all volunteers. Pilots must have completed one or more operational tours on a fast jet such as the Tornado, Harrier, or Typhoon, have accumulated at least 1,500 flying hours, and have been assessed as above average in their operational role to be eligible. Even then, more than ten pilots apply for each place on the team. Pilots stay with the Red Arrows for a three-year tour of duty. Three pilots are changed every year, such that normally three first-year pilots, three second-year pilots, and three in their final year are on the team. The team leader also spends three years with the team. The &#x27;Boss&#x27;, as he is known to the rest of the team, is always a pilot who has previously completed a three-year tour with the Red Arrows, often (although not always) including a season as the leader of the Synchro Pair.

During the second half of each display, the Red Arrows split into two sections. Reds 1 to 5 are known as &#x27;Enid&#x27; (named after Enid Blyton, author of the &quot;Famous Five&quot; books) and Reds 6 to 9 are known as &#x27;Hanna&#x27; (named after Red Arrows&#x27; founding member Squadron Leader Ray Hanna). Enid continue to perform close-formation aerobatics, while Hanna perform more dynamic manoeuvres. Red 6 (Syncro Leader) and Red 7 (Synchro 2) make up the Synchro Pair and they perform a series of opposition passes during this second half. At the end of each season, one of that year&#x27;s new pilots will be chosen to be Red 7 for the following season, with that year&#x27;s Red 7 taking over as Red 6.
The Reds have no reserve pilots, as spare pilots would not perform often enough to fly to the standard required, nor would they be able to learn the intricacies of each position in the formation. If one of the pilots is not able to fly, the team flies an eight-plane formation. However, if the Team Leader, &#x27;Red 1&#x27;, is unable to fly, then the team does not display at all. Each pilot always flies the same position in the formation during a season. The pilots spend six months from October to April practising for the display season. Pilots wear green flying suits during training, and are only allowed to wear their red flying suits once they are awarded their Public Display Authority at the end of winter training.

The new pilots joining the team spend their first season flying at the front of the formation near the team leader. As their experience and proficiency improve, they move to positions further back in the formation in their second and third seasons. Pilots who start on the left of the formation stay on that side for the duration of their three-year tour; the pilots on the right side stay on the right. The exception to this are Reds 6 and 7 (the Synchro Pair), who fly in the &#x27;stem&#x27; of the formation - the two positions behind the team leader.

During an aerobatics display, Red Arrows pilots experience forces up to five times that of gravity (1g), and when performing the aerobatic manoeuvre &#x27;Vixen Break&#x27;, forces up to 7g can be reached, close to the 8g structural limit of the aircraft.

As well as the nine pilots, &#x27;Red 10&#x27;, who is the team supervisor, is a fully qualified Hawk pilot who flies the tenth aircraft when the Red Arrows are away from base. This means the team have a reserve aircraft at the display site. Red 10&#x27;s duties include co-ordination of all practices and displays and acting as the team&#x27;s ground safety officer. Red 10 often flies TV cameramen and photographers for air-to-air pictures of the Red Arrows and also provides the commentary for all of the team&#x27;s displays.

On 13 May 2009, it was announced that the Red Arrows would include their first female display pilot. Flt Lt Kirsty Moore (née Stewart) joined for the 2010 season. Flt Lt Moore was not the first female to apply to become a Red Arrow, but was the first to be taken forward to the intense final selection process. She joined the RAF in 1998 and was a qualified flying instructor on the Hawk aircraft at RAF Valley. Prior to joining the team, she flew the Tornado GR4 at RAF Marham.

==The &#x27;Blues&#x27;==
The engineering and support team that supports the Red Arrows is known as &quot;The Blues&quot; and consists of more than 90 members drawn from a wide-variety of technical and support trades in the RAF. The vast majority of this team is commanded by the Senior Engineering Officer, who is responsible for all engineering and logistics delivery of the aircraft and display support; including the Red Arrow&#x27;s famous red, white and blue smoke trails. Other display support areas are led by a Chief of Staff, PR Manager and Operations Officer. 

The diverse constitution of the Blues team includes aircraft technicians, survival equipment specialists, drivers, logisticians, photographers and operations specialists. Each season up to eleven members of the Blues are selected to be members of the &#x27;Circus&#x27;. The position of &quot;Circus 1&quot; (the engineer who accompanies Red 1) is normally occupied by the Junior Engineering Officer. Similarly, the position of Circus Leader (Red 9) is occupied by a technician of sergeant rank; the other slots being filled by technicians holding corporal or senior aircraftman rank, with a photographer in the &quot;Circus 10&quot; position and, typically, the Senior Engineering Officer as &quot;Circus 11&quot;, when the Officer Commanding flies. Each member of the Circus works with the same pilot for the duration of the season and is responsible for servicing and refuelling their aircraft and preparing their flying kit prior to each display. Circus members fly in the back seats of the jets during transit flight to ensure ground support at any location where the team lands. Two specialist engineering &quot;Dye&quot; Teams also support the Red Arrows when moving around the UK, or overseas, deploying with a &#x27;smoke rig&#x27; to strategic locations in order to replenish the smoke pod.

==Aircraft==

The team use the same two-seat training aircraft used for advanced pilot training, at first the Folland Gnat which was replaced in 1979 by the BAE Systems Hawk T1.

The Hawks in 1979 were assembled at RAF Bitteswell in Leicestershire; the site had 1,100 workers. The first of the ten Hawks was delivered on Friday 17 August 1979, with the ninth &#x27;XX266&#x27; being delivered on 15 November 1979.

The full set of Hawks would be shown to the public at Bitteswell on 18 November 1979, which was moved to 15 November 1978. The Hawk had less acceleration than the Gnat.

British Aerospace (Hawker Siddeley before 1977) at Bitteswell had been the engineering &#x27;home&#x27; of the unit since the era of the Gnats in 1968. The winter overhaul would be at Bitteswell, from 1968. After a Gnat had left Bitteswell, it would have another 1,000 hours of flying life. The aircraft would be totally stripped of red paint, and repainted red only once flight tests were acceptable. Team pilots would visit Bitteswell.

The Gnat Orpheus engine was built by Rolls-Royce at Anstey, and serviced there, with components made in Coventry. The Hawk Adour engine was built in Derby.

Hawks would be sent for repair to Bitteswell.155 Hawks were being delivered to the RAF, with 20 more after November 1979. 1980 was the first Hawk season. Margaret Thatcher visited the site on 27 June 1980, sitting in a Hawk jet. In late March 1982 it was announced that the 567-acre Bitteswell site would close in 1983, due to widespread defence cuts, one week before the Falklands war. It had been a repair site since 1956. It is now a huge distribution centre.

The Hawks are modified with an uprated engine and a modification to enable smoke to be generated; diesel is mixed with a coloured dye and ejected into the jet exhaust to produce either red, white or blue smoke.
==Displays==

The first display by the Red Arrows was at RAF Little Rissington on 6 May 1965. The display was to introduce the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team to the media. However, the first public display was on 9 May 1965 in France, at the French National Air Day in Clermont-Ferrand. The first public display in the UK was on 15 May 1965 at the Biggin Hill International Air Fair. The first display with nine aircraft was on 8 July 1966 at RAF Little Rissington.

The first display in Germany was at RAF Laarbruch on 6 August 1965. The Red Arrows performed in Germany a further 170 times before formation aerobatics were banned in Germany following the Ramstein airshow disaster in 1988.

During displays, the aircraft do not fly directly over the crowd apart from entering the display area by flying over the crowd from behind; any manoeuvres in front of and parallel to the audience can be as low as , the &#x27;synchro pair&#x27; can go as low as straight and level, or when in inverted flight. To carry out a full looping display the cloud base must be above to avoid the team entering the cloud while looping. If the cloud base is less than but more than the Team will perform the Rolling Display, substituting wing-overs and rolls for the loops. If the cloud base is less than the Team will fly the Flat Display, which consists of a series of fly-pasts and steep turns.

The greatest number of displays flown in any year was in 1995, when the Red Arrows performed 136 times. The smallest number of displays in one year was in 1975, after the 1973 oil crisis limited their appearances. At a charity auction in 2008, a British woman paid £1.5 million to fly with them.

By the end of the 2009 season, the Red Arrows had performed a total of 4,269 displays in 53 countries. The 4,000th display was at RAF Leuchars during the Battle of Britain Airshow in September 2006.

Following the accidents during the 2011 season, the Red Arrows retained Red 8 and moved the original Red 10 to the Red 5 position to enable them to continue displaying with nine aircraft. In March 2012, the MoD announced that the Red Arrows would fly aerobatic displays with seven aircraft during the 2012 display season as Flt Lt Kirsty Stewart had moved into a ground-based role with the team. It is believed this was due to the emotional stress she had been suffering over the loss of her two Red Arrows colleagues the previous year. As a consequence of this, Red 8 also dropped out of the display team to enable an odd number of aircraft to perform and thus maintain formation symmetry. However, the team carried out official flypasts with nine aircraft by utilising Red 8 as well as ex-Red Arrow display pilot and then Red 10 Mike Ling. The Red Arrows returned to a full aerobatic formation of nine aircraft in 2013.
In 2014, The Red Arrows celebrated 50 years of Aerobatic history as a display team returning to RAF Fairford for the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT). For the entirety of the 2014 display season, the aircraft carried special 50th Anniversary markings on their tails instead of just the red, white and blue stripes.
After the 2016 display season, the Red Arrows embarked on an Asia-Pacific and Middle East Tour. They performed flypasts or displays in Karachi in Pakistan; Hindon and Hyderabad in India; Dhaka in Bangladesh; Singapore; Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia; Danang in Vietnam; Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Zhuhai in China; Muscat in Oman; Manama in Bahrain; Abu Dhabi and Kuwait. The programme was the first time the team had displayed in China, and the first time a British military aircraft had deployed to Vietnam.

The summer 2019 display season took the team on a tour of North America, known as &quot;Western Hawk 19.&quot; After performing at RIAT, the team departed across the Atlantic at the end of July. As well as performing at US and Canadian air shows, they promoted the UK through school visits and meetings with business leaders. This was the Red Arrows&#x27; biggest-ever tour, flying to more than 25 cities, 21 displays and 30 flypasts.
On 2 June 2022 Trooping the Colour, as part of Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, closed with the Queen and Royal Family observing a flypast from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.

For the 2022 display season, The Red Arrows are flying a seven aircraft display, due to &quot;2 formation pilots moving to other roles within the RAF&quot;. Flypasts are still intended to be performed with nine aircraft, with experienced Red Arrows pilots flying the remaining 2 aircraft. On 2 June 2022 Trooping the Colour, as part of Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, closed with the Queen and Royal Family observing a flypast from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.

===Display charges===
In 1977, a charge of £200 was introduced by the MoD for a Red Arrows display. By 2000, the charge had risen to £2,000 (including VAT and insurance). In 2011 the team manager quoted the charge as £9,000.

===Transits===
On a transit flight (getting to or from a display location) the team may fly at the relatively low altitude of . This avoids the complication of moving through the cloud base in formation, and also avoids much controlled air space. Jets are more efficient at higher altitude, so longer flights are made at . On transit flights, the formation can include spare planes. Sometimes a C-130 Hercules or an Atlas C.1 accompanies them, carrying spare parts. They often provide flypasts and brief displays to smaller events if they are already passing over or it is a small detour.
As the fuel capacity of the Hawk sets a limit to nonstop flight distance, and the Hawk is incapable of air-to-air refuelling, very long flights between display sites may need landings on the way to refuel. For example, a flight from RAF Scampton to Quebec for an international air display team competition had to be done in seven hops: RAF Scampton, RAF Kinloss (Scotland), Keflavík (Iceland), Kangerlussuaq (west Greenland), Narsarsuaq (south tip of Greenland), Goose Bay (Newfoundland) and Bagotville (Quebec).

For the same reason, Red Arrows displays in New Zealand are unlikely because there is no land near enough for a Hawk to land and refuel to reach New Zealand on the most fuel that it can carry.

===Smoke===
The smoke trails left by the team are made by releasing diesel into the exhaust; this vaporises in the hot exhaust flow, then re-condenses into very fine droplets that give the appearance of a white smoke trail. Dyes can be added to produce the red and blue colour. The diesel is stored in the pod on the underside of the plane; it houses three tanks: one tank of pure diesel and two tanks of blue and red dyed diesel. The smoke system uses per minute; therefore each plane can trail smoke for a total of seven minutes: – five minutes of white smoke, a minute of blue and a minute of red.

In 2021, the MoD asked the civil sector to help develop an environmentally friendly smoke system for the team&#x27;s aircraft. This is part of its drive to make the RAF net-zero by 2040.

==Incidents and accidents==
&quot;Data from:&quot; Ejection History – Red Arrows
;: Gnat XR573 hit trees while joining formation during a practice at RAF Kemble. Flt Lt Jerry Bowler did not activate the ejection seat and was killed.
;15 June 1969: Three aircraft hit a flock of birds in a display at RAF Wildenrath
;: Two Gnats crashed, XR995 at Kemble, on fire and XR992 in a field near Chelworth. The pilots both ejected safely although a fire warning from air traffic was intended for XR995.
;: Gnats XR986 and XR545, collided during the cross-over manoeuvre over the runway at Kemble, with four fatalities.
;26 April 1971: Over Kent, two aircraft touched and had to make an emergency landing
;13 December 1971: Gnat XR567 crashed on approach to RAF Upper Heyford. Flt Lt Clem Longdon and Flt Lt Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Michael Storr did not eject and were killed. 
;16 February 1976:Gnat XP531 struck a cable and made emergency landing at RAF Kemble; damaged beyond repair. Both crew ejected safely.
; June 1976: Gnat XR987 – Flight instrument technician in the rear seat ejected during check flight to investigate uncommanded control movements. Pilot Flt Lt Dudley Carvell – Cpl Ginger Whelan ejected through the canopy from the back seat when he thought control of aircraft had been lost. &quot;No-one was hurt and we had the aircraft flying again the next week&quot;
;24 June 1976:Gnat Red 1 XS111 – The undercarriage collapsed when the aircraft ran into the overrun area after the brakes failed on landing at RAF Kemble, Gloucestershire; Sqn Ldr Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Duckett was unhurt.
;3 March 1978:Gnat Red 4 XR981 – Struck ground whilst practising Vic rollback aerobatics at RAF Kemble. Pilot Flt Lt Stephen Edward Noble and Wg. Cdr. Dennis George Hazell AFC died; XR981 happened during pre-season practice, specifically while the team were practicing roll-backs at low altitude. The aircraft ended up inverted and neither occupant left the aircraft. One seat fired, but couldn&#x27;t go anywhere. Steve Noble survived initially but died later that day. Quote: &quot;3 Mar 1978, in the footnote you are not sure which ejection seat fired. It was the rear seat (Wg Cdr Hazell). The aircraft had hit the ground and then bounced back into the air, one wing then dug in and the aircraft cartwheeled eventually ending up upside down. During this time it was still travelling at some speed and as the rear seat was a little higher and the canopy was broken, it made contact with the ground pulling the top handle of the seat and setting off the ejection sequence, but as you say the seat could not go anywhere and so the seat rails came out through the bottom of the floor. Sadly I witnessed this crash from start to finish, with many others, as it was a families day for the Red Arrows and many people were there to watch the practice&quot;.
;22 May 1979:Gnat XP539 had a fuel blockage that caused engine problems and aircraft was abandoned at RAF Leeming, Yorkshire. Wg Cdr Ernie Jones ejected OK (XP539 actually belonged to the Red Arrows, but was a reserve ship not fitted with smoke. It was flown by Wg Cdr Ernie Jones, who was the only person on board, and was visiting Training Command HQ. The accident was due to asymmetric fuelling of the aircraft – when one side ran out of fuel the flow proportioner, which equalised usage from both sides, cut the fuel flow off from the other side, causing embarrassment).
;: Hawk XX262 hit a yacht mast at an air show in Brighton, Sussex. The pilot, Sqn Ldr Steve Johnson, ejected safely.
;: A Hawk hit the ground at RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, while practising a loop. The pilot, Flt Lt Chris Hirst, suffered serious injuries when the impact with the ground forced the ejection seat through the canopy and deployed the drogue chute, dragging him out.
;:Hawk XX257 crashed into the sea 3 miles off Sidmouth, Devon after the engine suffered a failure of a rotor blade in the low pressure compressor. Pilot, Flt Lt P.D. Lees was rescued by a Sidmouth independent inshore rescue boat.
;: A Hawk rammed into the back of another on a runway.
;:Hawk XX297 flown by Flt Lt Dan Findlay flew into the jet wash of the leading aircraft during a practice display at RAF Scampton and was unable to relight the Hawk&#x27;s engine. The pilot ejected safely after unsuccessfully attempting an emergency landing back at RAF Scampton.
;: Hawks XX241 &amp; XX259 collided during a winter training practice with one aircraft crashing into a house in the village of Welton, Lincolnshire. The aircraft of Flt Lt Spike Newbery struck the aircraft of new Team Leader Sqn Ldr Tim Miller from behind, knocking off the tail. Both pilots ejected successfully. Flt Lt Newbery suffered a broken leg and had to leave the team.
;:Hawk XX304 crashed whilst attempting to take off, and the fuel tanks exploded. The pilot Sqn Ldr Pete J. Collins, Red Arrows&#x27; deputy leader, ejected safely.
;:Hawk XX243 crashed practising a &quot;roll back&quot; at RAF Scampton. The pilot Flt Lt Neil Duncan MacLachlan was killed.
;: Flt Lt R. Edwards landed short of the runway after a practice run at the Red Arrows then home base, RAF Cranwell, and ejected safely at low altitude.
;: A Hawk overshot the runway while landing at Jersey Airport in advance of an air display. The pilot Flt Lt Jez Griggs ran the jet into a gravel pile and little damage was sustained.
;: The wingtip of a Hawk hit the tail of another during a practice flight near RAF Scampton.
;: Two Hawks were involved in a mid-air collision. The synchro pair were practising one of their manoeuvres when the two aircraft collided. Red 7 (Flt Lt David Montenegro) landed his plane safely, but Red 6 (Flt Lt Mike Ling) ejected and suffered a dislocated shoulder. The incident took place during pre-season training in Crete. Due to his injuries, Flt Lt Ling was unable to participate in the forthcoming display season and was replaced by 2008&#x27;s Red 6, Flt Lt Paul O&#x27;Grady.

:A Hawk aircraft crashed into a field near Throop Mill, one mile from Bournemouth Airport following a display at the Bournemouth Air Festival. Flt Lt Jon Egging, pilot of Red 4 (XX179), died in the accident. The investigation into the incident determined that Flt Lt Egging was incapacitated due to the effects of g-force induced loss of consciousness until very shortly before impact. A memorial to Egging was originally unveiled in 2012 at East Cliff, Bournemouth, before being moved to a new location nearby in 2017 following a landslip. His widow Emma Egging was made an OBE in the 2021 Birthday Honours.
;: Pilot Flt Lt Sean Cunningham was ejected from his aircraft while it was on the ground at RAF Scampton and subsequently died from his injuries. He was shot into the air and received fatal injuries when his parachute failed to open. The UK Health and Safety Executive announced in 2016 that it would be prosecuting the ejection seat manufacturer Martin-Baker for breach of Health and Safety law. The company has since pleaded guilty to breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. 
;20 March 2018: A Hawk crashed at RAF Valley. Two people, the pilot and an engineer, were on board at the time. The pilot of Red 3, Flt Lt David Stark, was hospitalised with non-life-threatening injuries whilst the engineer, Cpl Jonathan Bayliss, was killed. According to the coroner the crash could have been avoided. Flt Lt Stark was unable to resume his place in the 2018 display team and was replaced by Sqn Ldr Mike Ling, outgoing Red 10.
;28 August 2022
: A bird strike smashed the cockpit canopy of Red 6 during the closing display at Rhyl Air Show. As a result the display was cut short and the Red Arrows returned to Hawarden airfield where they were based for the weekend. The pilot, Sqn Ldr Gregor Ogston was unharmed. Images shared on The Red Arrows social media accounts showed his helmet had taken the impact force of the bird strike.

==Video game==
In 1985, Database Software released a flight simulator called &quot;Red Arrows&quot;, made in cooperation with the flight team. In the simulator, stunts have to be performed while flying in formation. It was available for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro and Atari.

==Former pilots==
* Sqn Ldr Jeff Glover, from 1988; he was shot down in May 1982 in Harrier &quot;XZ972&quot; of 1 Sqn, by a Blowpipe missile, and taken prisoner in the Falklands; he was the only British pilot to be captured by the Argentinians, and held for seven weeks, with 12 days in a darkened room; he originated from Eccleston in Merseyside, attending the Cowley Grammar School, joined Oxford University Air Squadron, studying engineering, and played for the university football team, playing at Wembley in December 1972; he broke his collar bone and left shoulder in the ejection in 1982; he joined the unit, aged 33, in January 1988, to replace 32 year old Flt Lt Neil MacLachlan, who was killed.

<text>Enallage (; , &quot;enallagḗ&quot;, &quot;interchange&quot;) is one type of scheme of rhetorical figures of speech which is used to refer to the use of tense, form, or person for a grammatically incorrect counterpart.

==Form==
One use of enallage is to give a sentence improper form quite deliberately. Shakespeare wrote, &quot;‘Is there not wars? Is there not employment?’&quot; (2nd Henry IV, I, ii) In these cases, he uses enallage to achieve parallel structure. Byron stated, &quot;The idols are broke in the temple of Baal.&quot; Here he used the past tense form of &quot;break&quot; instead of the past participle, &quot;broken,&quot; which should have been used. In the opening lines of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Virgil speaks of the “walls of lofty Rome.” Daniel Mendelsohn, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, cites this as an example of enallage: &quot;The poet knew what he was doing—&#x27;lofty walls&#x27; is about architecture, but &#x27;lofty Rome&#x27; is about empire,&quot; though arguably this figure could be considered &quot;hypallage,&quot; the transposition of the natural relations of two elements in a proposition.

Another noted example is when professional prize fight manager Joe Jacobs cried, &quot;We was robbed!&quot;, after his fighter lost a decision in 1932. Through this utterance Arthur Quinn claimed Jacobs &quot;achieved for himself linguistic immortality.&quot;

Apple&#x27;s advertising slogan Think Different can be viewed as a deliberately incorrect grammatical construction.

==Person==
Limhi, a king in the Book of Mormon, gave an example of enallage by switching persons during one of his discourses. Limhi began his discourse by addressing his people using the second person pronouns &quot;ye&quot; and &quot;you&quot;: &quot;O &quot;ye&quot;, my people, lift up &quot;your&quot; heads and be comforted&quot; (Mosiah 7:18). However, later in his discourse Limhi shifted to the third person when addressing his people: &quot;But behold, &quot;they&quot; would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among &quot;them&quot;, even so much that &quot;they&quot; did shed blood among &quot;themselves&quot;&quot; (Mosiah 7:25). One possible reason why Limhi performed this second-person to third-person pronoun shifting was to create distance between his people and their actions, allowing them to become objective observers of their own behavior.

At the conclusion of his discourse Limhi switched back to the second person: &quot;And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and &quot;ye&quot; are smitten and afflicted. But if &quot;ye&quot; will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put &quot;your&quot; trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if &quot;ye&quot; do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver &quot;you&quot; out of bondage&quot; (Mosiah 7:32–33). Switching back to the second-person allowed Limhi to personalize the message of deliverance to his people, allowing them to understand that even though they had committed grave errors, they could still repent and be delivered out of bondage.

<text>Düren () is a Kreis (district) in the west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Heinsberg, Neuss, Rhein-Erft-Kreis, Euskirchen and Aachen.

==History==

The district was created in 1972 by merging the former districts of Jülich and Düren. Both districts date back to 1816 when the new Prussian province Rhineland was created. Before the Napoleonic Wars all of the area belonged to the duchy of Jülich.

==Geography==

Geographically it covers both the lowlands of the Lower Rhine Bay as well as the mountains and hills of the Eifel. The district has rich lignite (brown coal) deposits, which is used in open pit mining. Another big industry is paper production, which dates back to the second part of the 16th century. The main river in the district is the Rur.

<doc id="184071" wikidata="Q181882" url="?curid=184071" title="County Carlow">
<text>County Carlow ( ; ) is a county located in the Southern Region of Ireland, within the province of Leinster. Carlow is the second smallest and the third least populous of Ireland&#x27;s 32 traditional counties. Carlow County Council is the governing local authority.

The county is named after the town of Carlow, which lies on the River Barrow and is both the county town and largest settlement, with over 40% of the county&#x27;s population. Much of the remainder of the population also reside within the Barrow valley, in towns such as Leighlinbridge, Bagenalstown, Tinnahinch, Borris and St Mullins. Carlow shares a border with Kildare and Laois to the north, Kilkenny to the west, Wicklow to the east and Wexford to the southeast.

Carlow is known as &quot;The Dolmen County&quot;, a nickname based on the Brownshill Dolmen, a 6,000-year-old megalithic portal tomb which is reputed to have the heaviest capstone in Europe, weighing over 100 metric tonnes. The town of Carlow was founded by the Normans in 1207 and the county was shired shortly thereafter, making it one of the oldest counties in Ireland. During the 14th century, the county was the seat of power of the Kingdom of Leinster, as well as the capital of the Lordship of Ireland from 1361 to 1374.

==Etymology==

The county was named after the town of Carlow, which is an anglicisation of the Irish &quot;Ceatharlach&quot;. Historically, it was anglicised as &quot;Caherlagh&quot;, &quot;Caterlagh&quot; and &quot;Catherlagh&quot;, which are closer to the Irish spelling. In the 19th century, John O&#x27;Donovan, a scholar working with Ordnance Survey Ireland, hypothesised that the origin of the name was &quot;Ceatharloch&quot; (meaning &quot;quadruple lake&quot;), since &quot;ceathar&quot; means &quot;four&quot; and &quot;loch&quot; means &quot;lake&quot;. It is therefore directly translated as &quot;Four lakes&quot;. This was accepted by the foremost etymologist of the time, PW Joyce, as the definitive origin of the name; although Joyce noted there was no evidence to suggest that these lakes ever existed in the area.

It is today believed that the first part of the name derives from the Old Irish word &quot;cethrae&quot; (&quot;animals, cattle, herds, flocks&quot;), which is related to &quot;ceathar&quot; (&quot;four&quot;) and therefore signified &quot;four-legged&quot;. The second part of the name is the ending &quot;-lach&quot;, meaning that &quot;Ceatharlach&quot; referred to a &quot;place of cattle or herds&quot;. As the local dialect of Irish evolved, the &quot;th&quot; phoneme became obsolete. Consequently, by the 13th century the pronunciation of the name would have been much closer to its modern anglicised form. Surviving texts from the 15th and 16th centuries which spell the name as &quot;Carelagh&quot; and &quot;Kerlac&quot; seem to reflect this change in pronunciation.

==Geography and subdivisions==
Carlow is the second-smallest of Ireland&#x27;s 32 counties by area, and the third-smallest in terms of population. It is the second-smallest of Leinster&#x27;s 12 counties in both size and population. Carlow is landlocked and bordered by five counties – Kilkenny to the west, Wicklow to the east, Wexford to the southeast, and Laois and Kildare to the north. Carlow town is both the county town and largest settlement, and is situated on the River Barrow in the north of the county approximately from Waterford and from Dublin.

===Physical geography===
Carlow&#x27;s southern, western and eastern boundaries are demarcated by the county&#x27;s three principal geographic features – the River Barrow, the River Slaney and the Blackstairs Mountains – which are all European Union designated Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). The county is divided into six physiographic regions – the Barrow Valley, Castlecomer Plateau, Nurney Ridge and Blackstairs Mountains, as well as the Tullow Lowlands and Southern Wedge, which are grouped together as an &quot;Intermediate Region&quot;. The county is generally rural in nature and has a population density of 63 people per km2, with the majority of the population living within the Barrow Valley.

The River Barrow, at in length, is Ireland&#x27;s second longest river. The river cuts out a low-lying valley as it traverse through the county, and much of the county is drained by the Barrow and its tributaries. The most prominent tributary of the Barrow in the area is the Burren River, which rises at Mount Leinster and flows through the county for before joining the Barrow at Carlow town. The east and northeast of the county are drained by the River Slaney and its tributaries – the River Derreen, which flows through Hacketstown and Tullow, and the River Derry, which rises at Eagle Hill south of Hacketstown and forms the border between Carlow and Wexford before joining the Slaney at Bunclody.

As of 2017, there is a total of of forest cover in the county, representing 9.4% of total land area. This is below the national average of 11% forest cover and represents just 1.1% of the national forest total. The majority of the county&#x27;s forests are located in upland areas, namely the Blackstairs Mountains in the east of the county, and the Castlecomer Plateau in the west of the county. Conifers are primarily grown in these areas and constitute 69.9% of all forest cover within the county. Due to the high quality of land in the lowlands and southern wedge, the area under forest is low, as most of the land is used for agricultural purposes. Some of the oldest deciduous trees in the county are found in the yew grove at the Huntington Gardens, which were planted by the Esmonde family over 500 years ago. Other notable woodland areas include the Oak Park Forest, which is a ca. 123 acre mixed forest of beech, oak, Scots pine, silver fir, larch and sycamore; the Altamont Gardens and the Barrow Way.

====Climate====
Carlow is in a maritime temperate oceanic region according to Köppen climate classification. It experiences cool winters, mild humid summers, and a lack of temperature extremes. Met Éireann records climate data for Carlow from their station at Oak Park, situated at above sea level. The coldest month is February, with an average daily minimum temperature of , and the hottest month is July, with an average daily maximum temperature of . The driest months are April and May, with and of rain respectively. The wettest month is November, with of rain on average. Humidity is high year round and rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year. A number of synoptic stations which record rainfall are located throughout the county. The driest area of the county is at Tullow, which receives of rainfall per year, and the Blackstairs Mountains are the wettest area, receiving of rainfall per year.

While Carlow is often marketed as being part of the Sunny Southeast alongside Wexford and Waterford, due to its inland location it does not typically benefit from the elevated sunshine hours observed in the coastal areas of those counties. However, it does experience significantly higher average temperatures and lighter winds during the summer months due to its sheltered location. This was exemplified during the 2018 summer heat wave, when Oak Park was both the hottest and driest location in Ireland.

===Geology===
The bedrock geology of Carlow consists primarily of granite, which underlies roughly 70% of the county. Following the closure of the Iapetus Ocean approximately 400 Mya, a mountain range formed in the area which was then intruded with magma. This cooled slowly beneath the surface, forming a large granite pluton. The mountains, which were mostly composed of Ordovician seafloor sediments, were eventually eroded away, exposing the granite at the surface. During the Carboniferous, ca. 300 Mya, limestone re-buried this granite, but has also since been eroded away. More resilient Carboniferous period shales and sandstones are preserved in the Castlecomer Plateau, along with significant quantities of coal.

The oldest rocks in the county are the surviving remnants of these Ordovician seafloor sediments (ca. 540 Mya), and are found in a thin belt extending across the east of the county. These sediments were intensely metamorphosed by the heat of the granite into high-grade schists and hornfels. Minerals such as staurolite, andalusite and garnet are commonplace in these older formations.

The soils of the county are mostly derived from glacial till, rather than solid bedrock geology. These typically consist of a mix of clay, sand and gravel. Occasionally glacial melt-water would form a long ridge of sand and gravel known as an esker. One such example is preserved within the county and is a proposed natural heritage area, referred to as the Ballymoon Esker. The north of the county is generally flat, while central and southern Carlow are characterised by an undulating to rolling topography which becomes progressively hillier towards the south and east. The Blackstairs Mountains are the highest and most extensive upland area, with Mount Leinster rising to , making it the highest point in both Carlow and Wexford and the seventh highest county top in Ireland.

===Baronies===

There are seven historic baronies in the county. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for administrative purposes. The last boundary change of a barony in Carlow was in 1841, when the barony of St. Mullin&#x27;s was divided into St. Mullin&#x27;s Lower and St. Mullin&#x27;s Upper. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under &quot;Administrative units&quot;. The largest barony in Carlow is Idrone East, at 52,857 acres (214 km2), and the smallest barony is St. Mullin&#x27;s Upper, at 7,784 acres (32 km2).

===Civil parishes and townlands===

Townlands are the smallest officially defined geographical divisions in Ireland. There are 650 townlands in Carlow, of which 22 are historic town boundaries. These town boundaries are registered as their own townlands and are much larger than rural townlands. The rural townlands of Carlow range from just 1 acre in size (Acuan) to 1,822 acres (Kilbrannish South), with the average size of a townland in the county (excluding towns) being 371 acres.

==Governance and politics==
===Local government===
Local government in County Carlow is governed by the Local Government Acts. There is a single level of local government in the county, with Carlow County Council responsible for local services.

There are 18 councillors on the county council. It is currently divided into three local electoral areas (LEAs), each of which is also a municipal district: Carlow (7), Muine Bheag (5) and Tullow (6).

Council elections are held every 5 years, with the next election due to be held in June 2029. The 2024 Carlow local election had a voter turnout of 47.5%, a decrease of 1.9% on the 2019 local election. The highest turnout was at Muine Bheag (51.3%) and the lowest was at Carlow (43.5%).
As was the case in much of Ireland, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael emerged as the two dominant parties in the 2024 local elections, holding 11 of the 18 seats between them. Sinn Féin hold 2 seats, the Labour Party, People Before Profit, and Independent Ireland hold 1 seat each, and there are 2 independents.

As part of the Southern Region (NUTS II Region), the council has two representatives on the Southern Regional Assembly, where it is part of the South-East strategic planning area (NUTS III Region).

===Former districts===
It was formerly divided into the rural districts of Baltinglass No. 2, Carlow, and Idrone, and the urban district of Carlow. The rural districts were abolished in 1925. Bagnelstown (Muine Bheag) and Tullow, within the former rural district of Carlow, had town commissioners. The town of Tullow was later disestablished as separate area. In 2002, the urban district of Carlow and the town commissioners of Muinebheag became town councils. All town councils in Ireland were abolished in 2014.

===National elections===
Carlow is part of the Dáil constituency of Carlow–Kilkenny which returns 5 TDs. The constituency has been in existence since the 1948 general election.

Prior to 1801, the county was represented in the Irish House of Commons through the constituencies of County Carlow, Carlow and the bishop&#x27;s borough of Old Leighlin, each of which returned two MPs. Following the Act of Union, the county was represented in Westminster through the County Carlow constituency, which returned two MPs (reduced to one under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. It was this constituency that gave Carlow representation in the First Dáil, convened in 1919.

It was part of the Dáil constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny from 1921 to 1937. Between 1937 and 1948 the county was divided, with the northern half of the county part of the Carlow-Kildare constituency, and the southern half joining the Wexford constituency. Since 1948, the county has again been joined with Kilkenny for national elections as Carlow–Kilkenny. From 1997 to 2020, a portion of the county was in the Wicklow, rejoining the rest of Carlow at the 2020 general election.

Carlow is part of the European Parliament constituency of South (5 seats).

==History==

The area of present-day Carlow has been inhabited for thousands of years, and the county has perhaps the highest concentration of megalithic monuments per square kilometre in Ireland. Numerous standing stones, bullauns and cairns mark the landscape. Carlow is nicknamed the &quot;Dolmen County&quot;, reflecting the abundance of dolmens found within its borders, of which the Brownshill Dolmen is reputed to be the largest in Europe. The historic clan territories of the county included Uí Drona (O&#x27;Ryan), Fothairt Feadh (O&#x27;Nolan), Uí Ceinnselaig (Kinsella), Dál Coirpri Cliach (Kerwick), (Kearney), Uí Felmeda Tuaidh (O&#x27;Garvey) and (O&#x27;Gorman). As Carlow contained both the navigable river Barrow as well as the Slighe Cualann (one of the key arterial roads leading to Tara), control of the area was vital to the claim of any prospective king of Leinster, and the area was much fought over. By the 11th century the Mac Murchada branch of the Uí Ceinnselaig dynasty had firmly established themselves as the Kings of Leinster.

===Emergence as a County===

With the exception of a short-lived Norse–Gael settlement near St. Mullin&#x27;s in the 9th century, the area remained under the control of the Kingdom of Leinster until the early 13th century. Following the Norman conquest, the &quot;Borough of Carlow&quot; was founded in July 1210, and formed part of the Norman palatine county of Leinster. This was later divided and the independent Liberty of Carlow was established in 1247. At that time the county was over three times larger than it is today, covering approximately and encompassing the majority of the old Diocese of Leighlin, extending to and including the coastal area around Arklow. 

The modern county boundary was shaped by the Gaelic Resurgence from the 14th to 16th centuries. During this period, Carlow was part of the patrimony of the Anglo-Norman Butler dynasty; however Art MacMurrough-Kavanagh, the ascendant King of Leinster, controlled more than half of the liberty. He was paid by the Anglo-Normans for his &quot;services&quot; in keeping the roads and trade routes of the area free of bandits, but in reality this amounted to nothing more than rent exacted by MacMurrough-Kavanagh as recognition of his sovereignty over the area. His authority was so absolute that the MacMurrough-Kavanagh&#x27;s retained control over large portions of the county for centuries, despite radical political changes. In the late 15th-century, James Butler, the 9th Earl of Ormond, purchased land within the county to give to his heirs, rather than enter into conflict with the dynasty. Descendants of the King of Leinster are still in possession of their ancestral home of Borris House to this day.

The informal alliance between the Kingdom of Leinster and the Anglo-Normans remained the status quo for decades, as it kept the peace and made both sides immensely wealthy. Cognisant of the political landscape, the Anglo-Normans began to marry into Gaelic families and adapt to native customs, forging alliances with Irish kingdoms to gain the upper hand over their fellow Anglo-Norman rivals. In a bid to halt the decline of English authority in the region, the crown made Carlow the capital of the Lordship of Ireland from 1361 until 1374, just north of MacMurrough-Kavanagh&#x27;s permanent residence at Leighlin.

Large areas on the northern and eastern fringes of the Liberty of Carlow gradually fell completely to the O&#x27;Moores, O&#x27;Byrnes and other chiefdoms. Consequently, when the Tudors reconquered these areas in the mid 16th century ownership was not reverted to the Anglo-Normans of Carlow but was instead granted to settlers from Britain. Carlow retained its Irish Sea border, though control of this land became disputed with the ruling chiefs of the area who were petitioning for their own shire. These areas were eventually given over to County Wicklow in 1606. The present-day boundary of Carlow therefore represents the core Norman holdings in the area which had persisted since the 12th century, propped up by the Caomhánach dynasty.

===Early modern history===

Following the Irish Confederate Wars in the 1650s, the great majority of Gaelic Irish and Anglo-Norman landowners were dispossessed, and their lands were granted to English soldiers who took part in the Cromwellian conquest. Carlow was one of four counties set aside by the Commonwealth government for the payment of public debt, although much of the land in these counties eventually ended up in the hands of notable regicides, considered &quot;friends of the Republic&quot;. These lands were legally deemed to be in the possession of King Charles II following the Restoration, and many dispossessed Irish nobles were able to petition the king and recover their lands. The Cromwellian conquest therefore had a limited impact on Carlow, as both Charles and the Parliament of Ireland had shown leniency to ordinary soldiers who were granted land elsewhere in Ireland, but all regicides were either exiled or executed.

Carlow, along with neighbouring Wexford, saw some of the fiercest fighting of the 1798 Rebellion. The rebellion in Carlow is particularly infamous for the sectarian excesses committed within the county. Prior to the rebellion, United Irishmen member William Farrell had claimed &quot;there was no part of Ireland where a better feeling of friendship existed between both Catholics and Protestants, nor no part where greater numbers of both were blood relations&quot;. However, in the wake of the French Revolution, local members of the Orange Order organised into a Yeomanry Cavalry Corps which conducted nightly raids on Catholic and Dissenter homes, often burning them to the ground, in search of weapons and revolutionary literature. 

As feelings of persecution and religious division grew amongst the overwhelmingly Catholic populace, local United Irish leader Laurence Griffin lamented &quot;the people of Carlow think of all Protestants as Orangemen&quot;. Catholics and non-Anglican Protestants could not vote to effect change, so they eventually joined forces with radical liberal Anglicans to overthrow the Parliament. The Battle of Carlow was one of the opening skirmishes of the rebellion in May 1798, and ended in a crushing defeat for the rebel forces. Months of intimidation and revenge attacks followed, led by Reverend Robert Rochfort of Clogrennan House, who oversaw the unlawful kidnapping, torture and execution of suspected United Irishmen, earning Rochfort the nickname &quot;the slashing parson&quot;.

The Irish language was still spoken in Carlow as late as the 1870s.

===Revolutionary Period===

During the War of Independence, the Carlow Brigade of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had 6 battalions which operated in the shadow of the Curragh Camp – the British Army&#x27;s headquarters in Ireland – across Carlow, western Wicklow, southern Kildare and eastern Laois and Kilkenny. The abandoned estate at Duckett&#x27;s Grove served as both an IRA training camp and the headquarters of the Carlow Brigade from 1919 to 1922.

Plagued by poor supply-lines and hindered by a heavy Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) presence, the Carlow Brigade was one of the least active of the war and mostly specialised in delaying tactics such as blocking roads, destroying bridges and intercepting mail. The brigade carried out a botched ambush near Ballymurphy in April 1921, with the loss of 12 members (4 killed and 8 captured) and vital munitions, after which no further active engagements with either the RIC or British Army were attempted.

The Carlow Republican District Court, established in February 1922 at the Carlow Courthouse, was the first post-independence court held by the government of the Irish Free State. Carlow saw relatively little action during the Civil War, as the Free State Army deployed hundreds of soldiers to the former RIC strongholds within the county, effectively strangling the Irregulars. The first head of an independent Irish-Government, President of the Executive Council W. T. Cosgrave, served as TD for Carlow–Kilkenny from 1921 to 1927.

==Places of interest==
===Landmarks===
==== Prehistoric era ====

Carlow is nicknamed the &quot;Dolmen County&quot;, reflecting the abundance of dolmens found within its borders. Dolmens or &quot;portal tombs&quot; are above-grove burial chambers which were used by Neolithic farming communities. The Brownshill Dolmen, situated on the Hacketstown Road (R726), has a capstone which weighs an estimated 100 metric tons, and is reputed to be the heaviest in Europe. The tomb is listed as a national monument. There are at least 10 megalithic tombs within the county, of which 7 are dolmens. Carlow and Kilkenny have 14 dolmens between them, many of which are among the most impressive in Ireland. This is unusual for such a small area. In contrast, County Galway, over twice the size of Carlow and Kilkenny combined, has 7 dolmens, and Cork – Ireland&#x27;s largest county – has just 2. This suggests that the fertile plains of the Barrow and its tributaries were well inhabited during the prehistoric era.

A wealth of Neolithic, Mesolithic and Bronze Age artefacts were discovered during excavations for the M9 Carlow Bypass in 2006. A total of 57 archaeological sites were identified along the proposed route and yielded a variety of relics, including flint arrowheads and bone scrapers, pottery, hammers and axeheads made of granite and an Iron Age glass bead. These artefacts are now housed in the Carlow County Museum. Their discovery a significant distance from any water sources revealed that the extent of early settlement in the area was more widespread than previously thought.

Numerous surviving Ogham stones dot the landscape of the county. The stones use Ogham inscription to record personal names, and were most likely commemorative monuments to the deceased individual. Many of the stones are inscribed with Old Irish, but some have been distinctly &quot;Christianised&quot; through the influence of local monastic settlements, such as the Rathglass Ogham Stone which reads &quot;Donaidonas Maqi Mariani&quot; – Donaidonas son of. Marianus. The stones are typically cut from weather-resistant granite, although they are not immune to decay. The Patrickswell Ogham Stone, believed to have been associated with the Waterstown ecclesiastical site, is now illegible.

==== Religious Structures ====
Early Christian settlements were founded throughout Carlow from the 5th to 7th century. An extensive monastic site is located at St Mullin&#x27;s in the southern tip of the county. The village is named after Saint Moling, who founded a monastery there in the early 7th century. The monastery was said to have been built with the help of &quot;Gobán Saor&quot;, the legendary Irish builder. An 8th-century manuscript, The Book of Mulling, contains a plan of the monastery – the earliest known plan of an Irish monastery – which shows four crosses inside and eight crosses outside the circular monastic wall. 

Old Leighlin was the site of one of the largest monastic settlements in Ireland, founded by St Goban in the 6th century. In 630 AD a church synod was held at Old Leighlin which determined the date of Easter. The main abbey of Old Leighlin was destroyed by fire in 1060 and replaced in the 12th century with St Laserian&#x27;s Cathedral. The cathedral remains in use to this day and was modified over centuries, with each change adding unique elements to the building. Among the most recent additions are the stained glass windows created by Catherine Amelia O&#x27;Brien in 1934. Once the cathedral church of the former Diocese of Leighlin, it is now one of the six cathedrals in the Diocese of Cashel and Ossory of the Church of Ireland.

The remote abbey of Clonmore was founded in the 6th century by Máedóc of Ferns. It flourished until the 11th century and taught Saint Finian Lobhar as well as Saint Oncho, who is buried at the site. While the monastery&#x27;s buildings have long since been demolished, a substantial cemetery remains which includes high crosses, ogham stones, ballaun stones and numerous inscribed grave slabs from Early Christian Ireland.

Another monastery was established by Saint Comhgall in 634 and is located in present-day Carlow town. The Normans built a stone wall around the town in the 13th century. The monastery, which was by that stage in ruins, lay just outside of it. The burial grounds survive today at Castle Hill and a new church was built at the site in 1727, known as St. Mary&#x27;s Church. A spire was added in 1834, which remains the tallest building in the county.

The Cathedral of the Assumption in Carlow town was built in a Gothic Revival style in the early 1800s and is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin. It once boasted a -tall ornately carved wooden pulpit, which is now on display in the Carlow County Museum and was featured in A History of Ireland in 100 Objects, a national project which identified one hundred archaeological or cultural objects that are important to Irish history.

====Castles====
The oldest known castles within the county date from the first few centuries AD. The two most common forms of early defensive structures were ringforts and Motte-and-bailey castles. This style of fortification remained prevalent for centuries, persisting even after the Norman Invasion in the 12th century.

The Rathvilly Moat, constructed in the 400s, was home to Crimthann mac Énnai, King of Leinster. The town of Rathvilly itself is named after an unknown historic ringfort, derived from the Irish ().

The arrival of the Normans was followed by the widespread construction of stone castles and tower houses throughout Ireland. These structures did not entirely supplant the earlier forms of fortification, as evidenced by Castlemore Moat, which is an example of a much later Motte-and-bailey. It was built by Raymond FitzGerald in the 12th century following his conquest of O&#x27;Nolan lands in the Barony of Forth. 

Although stone castles were generally of far superior quality, wooden structures were still favoured by the more mobile Irish kingdoms, as they could be easily constructed and abandoned when necessary. As late as the 1370s, the King of Leinster, Art McMurrough-Kavanagh, is recorded as residing in a large wooden fortress in the woods near Old Leighlin.

For six centuries, Carlow Castle was the oldest and most imposing stone castle in the county. Built from 1207 to 1213, the town of Carlow grew around it, and it once stood as the centrepiece of the walled medieval town, complete with four towers (of which two survive). The castle endured numerous sieges and conquests, and changed hands dozens of times throughout its history, remaining intact. In 1812 the castle was leased to Dr. Phillip Parry Price Middleton, who intended to convert it into a psychiatric hospital. In an ill-fated attempt at remodelling, Middleton used gunpowder to create cut-and-cover tunnels beneath the castle. This undermined the castle&#x27;s foundations and its entire eastern side collapsed into rubble. It lay abandoned until the Office of Public Works renovated the site in the 1990s.

Other notable castles and castle ruins which are listed as National Monuments include the 15th century Leighlinbridge Castle, around which the town of Leighlinbridge grew; Ballymoon Castle, which was constructed in the 13th century near Muine Bheag; and Ballyloughan Castle which belonged to the Kavanagh dynasty until the 16th century.

====Estates and Manor Houses====
Carlow was at the epicentre of the estates period of the late-18th and 19th centuries, and the county had a greater number of country houses and demesnes per hectare than any other rural county in Ireland. These &quot;Big Houses&quot; and their occupants dominated the economic and political landscape until the turn of the 20th century. Although the term was never applied at the time, historian Jimmy O&#x27;Toole refers to Carlow as &quot;the most gentrified county in Ireland&quot; due to the concentration of aristocratic families and their grand estates within its borders.

A valuation survey undertaken in 1876 revealed that just 21 families owned – almost 40% of the entire county. Although not as prevalent as in other counties, absenteeism by the landholding class in Carlow was still common. Towards the end of the 19th century, anger at high-rents and the widespread eviction of tenant farmers in Ireland resulted in the Land War (1879–1882) and the formation of the Irish National Land League led by Charles Stewart Parnell, which heralded the end of the estates period.

While as many as 300 Big Houses across Ireland were burned down during the revolutionary period, Carlow was left relatively untouched, losing just three Big Houses between 1919 and 1923, two of which were unoccupied. Éamon de Valera was against such burnings and addressed supporters at the gates of Browne&#x27;s Hill House in January 1923, stating that &quot;nothing was to be achieved by the burning or damaging of homes, big or small... raid for arms, yes, but leave them as they found them&quot;.

Some of the most prominent Big Houses are currently in public ownership, such as Altamont House, Oak Park and Duckett&#x27;s Grove. Several historically significant Big Houses such as Borris House, Huntington Castle and Dunleckney Manor are privately owned but open to tours and visitors at certain times of year. The majority of the surviving Big Houses within the county are in use as either private residences or hotels, while a small number have been abandoned and are in a derelict state.

===Natural Attractions===
====Gardens and Trails====

The Carlow Garden Trail features 21 gardens and curated woodlands of former estate houses located within the county. Gardens include the Delta Sensory Gardens in Carlow town, the Edinburgh Woollen Mills Arboretum in Leighlinbridge, the Borris House gardens and woodlands, Lucy&#x27;s Wood and the Newtownbarry House gardens near Bunclody, the Kilgraney house gardens, the Hardymount house gardens and the Duckett&#x27;s Grove gardens. The Robinsonian-style gardens of Altamont House are often referred to as &quot;the jewel in Ireland&#x27;s gardening crown&quot;.

There are several long-distance trails which traverse the county. Ireland&#x27;s flagship long-distance trail – the Wicklow Way – ends in Clonegal in northeastern Carlow, after crossing the Wicklow Mountains for . The Barrow Way follows the course of River Barrow for from Robertstown, County Kildare to St Mullin&#x27;s. The South Leinster Way begins at the foot of Mount Leinster near Kildavin, and runs for before joining the River Suir at Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary.

The Blackstairs Mountains are a designated Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) and contain a diverse range of habitats which are protected under Irish and European law. These habitats range from dense forested areas to open heath and blanket bog. Vegetation within the range is limited to those adapted to the strong winds and often freezing temperatures of the mountain-tops, and include Western gorse (Ulex gallii), Ling heather (Calluna vulgaris) and Bell Heather (Erica cinerea). The last recorded Irish wolf was shot and killed in Fenagh after wandering down from Mount Leinster in 1786. Populations of Red deer and Feral goats roam the range; however, human intervention is required to control their population as they now lack natural predators.

Other natural features and wildlife habitats within Carlow which have been identified as proposed Natural Heritage Areas include Baggot&#x27;s Wood, John&#x27;s Hill, Ardristan Fen, the Ballymoon Esker, the Slaney River Valley and Cloghristick Wood.

===Urban areas===
Carlow is the county town and by far the largest settlement, with approximately 44% of the county&#x27;s population. It is the 12th largest urban area in the State and, excluding cities, the 7th largest town.

Under CSO classification, an &quot;Urban Area&quot; is a town with a population greater than 1,500. Despite having only three towns which qualify as urban areas, County Carlow is predominantly an urban county. As of the 2022 census, 57.2 percent of the county lived in urban areas (i.e. the three largest towns), and the remaining 42.8 percent lived in rural areas. Nearly two-thirds (65.6 percent) of the county&#x27;s population live in the ten largest settlements.
==Economy==
The Central Statistics Office estimate of Carlow&#x27;s total household income in 2017 was €1.48 billion, ranking 24th out of 26 counties However, Carlow residents were the 13th highest per capita tax contributors in the State, returning a total of €331 million in taxes in 2017. This was primarily driven by the higher aggregate value of economic output from the county, along with higher wages when compared to counties in other regions such as the Midland or Border Region. Per capita disposable income in 2017 was €20,154, or 96.63% of the State average, ranking it 8th in the country. The primary economic sectors within the county are retail, services, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and the food and drink industry.

===Agriculture===
Despite its small size, Carlow has a large agricultural sector, and is a major producer of dairy, cereals and vegetables. Carlow has a tradition of producing high-quality agricultural products. Samuel Lewis&#x27;s 1837 Topographical Dictionary of Ireland noted the &quot;highly improved state&quot; of the county&#x27;s agricultural practices. It further states that &quot;wheat of a superior quality is grown in every part&quot; and that barley grown in Carlow &quot;has long been celebrated and in great demand, and large quantities are annually shipped to England&quot;.

Dairying is the most profitable agricultural sector in the county, which historically has always been the case. Lewis&#x27;s 1837 description states &quot;Dairies are numerous and the dairy farms extensive and profitable; butter, generally of very superior quality and much esteemed in English and foreign markets, is the chief produce&quot;. As of 2018, there were 102,357 cows within the county, approximately 60% of which were beef cattle, and the remainder dairy cattle. The county also has Ireland&#x27;s 13th largest sheep herd (108,851 sheep) and 13th largest pig herd (40,715 pigs).

There are 1,806 individual farms in the county, with a total farmed area of , accounting for 79% of land area. Of this, is under tillage, the 9th highest in Ireland, and of land is dedicated to horticulture and fruit, the 8th highest. The average size of a farm in the county is , significantly above the national average of and according to the Irish Farmers&#x27; Association, the total value of agricultural produce from Carlow in 2016 was €188 million.

===Industry===

Historically, Carlow was the primary producer of sugar beet in Ireland. The Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company was created in 1926 by Carlow businessman Edward Duggan, and was a landmark moment in the industrialisation of the nascent Irish State. In 1933 the plant was nationalised by the newly elected Fianna Fáil government. The government were pursuing a policy of autarky and recognised sugar manufacturing as a core national industry, creating a State-owned sugar company – Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann – with the Carlow plant as its headquarters. The plant&#x27;s forced closure in 2005 due to the introduction of EU sugar quotas was highly controversial.

Manufacturing, biosciences, retail, services and agribusiness are the county&#x27;s primary economic sectors. Burnside Group are the largest single employer in the county, with over 800 employees at their sites in Tullow, Bagenalstown and Carlow. Manufacturing firm Autolaunch employ 300 people at their plant in Muine Bheag. Pharmaceutical giant Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme has a vaccine manufacturing plant in Carlow, which employs 300 people, and Tirlán agribusiness has two feed mills in the county, at Carlow and Tinnahinch. The county is also a key supplier to the Tirlán milk pool.

In the services and IT sector, US-based insurance firm Unum employs 150 people in Carlow town, and indigenous security firm Netwatch, headquartered in Carlow town, employs 160 people, with an additional 340 employees in the UK and USA.

Multinational oil and gas exploration company Tullow Oil was founded in Tullow by Aidan Heavey in 1985. The company, which is now headquartered in London, is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and recorded a revenue of just over €1.6 billion in 2023.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
====Road====
County Carlow is located along the main Dublin to Waterford motorway, the M9. The M9 bypasses Carlow town to the south and has aided the growth of other commuter towns located near junctions along the M9, such as Leighlinbridge and Ballinabranna. The N80 cross-cuts the county for , running from Carlow town to the Wexford border at Bunclody. The N81 was built to replace the old local railway line and traverses the county for from Ballon, through Rathvilly and Tullow, up to the County Wicklow border and on to Dublin city.

Bus Éireann, as well as private coach operators, provide bus services to villages and towns across the county.

The county is served by the following national primary roads and secondary roads:
====Rail====

Rail coverage in Carlow is sparse, with only one active rail line currently serving the county. The Great Southern and Western Railway extended to Carlow town in August 1846. This line remains in use and serves both Carlow town and Muine Bheag along the main Dublin–Waterford railway line. The line is operated by Irish Rail and runs eight trains per day (Monday to Friday) from Carlow to Heuston Station. It is primarily used by commuters to Dublin city.

Historically, the railway network was more extensive. A rail line ran from Naas in County Kildare to Tullow and Rathvilly. This line opened in 1886 and was designed to pass through the scenic west Wicklow hills. The line closed for passenger traffic in 1947, and finally terminated all operations in 1959.

An additional line connecting Carlow to Wexford was constructed by the Bagenalstown and Wexford Railway Company. It opened its first station in December 1858 and operated two trains per day before going bankrupt in June 1864. Great Southern and Western Railway bought the line, and its successor CIÉ continued its services until 1 January 1963.

====Air====

For international flights, Dublin Airport is the closest international airport to Carlow. The airport is less than 2 hours by car from most towns and villages in the county. The airport can also be accessed via bus from some of the larger towns, or by linking the train from Carlow town or Bagenalstown to the Aircoach in Dublin city. Waterford Airport is the closest regional airport; however, it is currently non-operational.

The county has two airstrips which are used for light aircraft and recreational flying. The Hacketstown Airfield (ICAO Code: EIHN) is located on the Tinaheally Road approximately south of Hacketstown and has one 375m runway. The Killamaster Airstrip is located northwest of Carlow town.

==Sport==
===GAA===
In GAA, Carlow is recognised as a dual county, meaning that Gaelic football and Hurling are equally popular. The county competes in Division 1B of the National Hurling League and Division 3 of the National Football League. Historically, the county has seen little success at top level in either sport, its biggest achievement being a Leinster football provincial win in 1944. That year, Carlow progressed to the All-Ireland semi-final, in which they were beaten by Kerry.

At club level, the county has seen much more success. Football clubs compete annually in the Carlow Senior Football Championship. The competition was first played for two years in 1889 and 1890, after which financial constraints suspended activities until 1897. Ballon O&#x27;Gorman Mahons won the first, and what would be their only, championship title in 1889, beating the Tullow Stars and Stripes 1–01 to 0–00. The most successful club in the county is Éire Óg, with 28 Senior Football Championship titles. At provincial level, clubs from Carlow have won 6 Leinster Senior Club Football Championship titles, the 3rd most of any county. Of these, Éire Óg have won 5 and O&#x27;Hanrahans GFC have won 1, the most recent of which was in 2000. No team from Carlow has ever won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship, although Éire Óg have been runners up on two occasions in 1993 and 1996.

The county&#x27;s hurling tradition is more recent, dating back to the first Carlow Senior Hurling Championship in 1927. The first championship was won by Carlow town in a 2–03 to 1–04 victory over Bagnelstown. The most successful hurling club in the county is St. Mullin&#x27;s, with 27 titles. In 2013 Mount Leinster Rangers became the first Carlow club to win a Leinster Senior Club Hurling title, and the club made in to the finals of the All-Ireland the following year, but were beaten by Portumna.

===Other sports===

In addition to Gaelic games, clubs for other organised sports were set up across the county in the latter half of the 19th century. Several Carlow landlords were involved in the formation of the Phoenix Cricket Club (Ireland&#x27;s oldest cricket club) in 1830. Local aristocrat Horace Rochfort founded the Carlow Cricket Club the following year. The Bagnelstown Cricket Club was set up in 1843, making the derby between these two clubs the longest provincial cricket rivalry in Ireland. Towards the end of his life, Rochfort also established the Carlow Rugby Football Club (Ireland&#x27;s second oldest rugby club) in 1873, as well as the Carlow (and later Ireland) Polo club.

In association football, Carlow was represented in the League of Ireland by F.C. Carlow, which competed in the A Championship until the club&#x27;s disbandment in 2016. While the county currently lacks a prominent football club, local amateur clubs compete in the Carlow and District Football League. There are also over a dozen golf courses within the county, among them the Carlow Golf Club, Killerig castle, Borris Golf Club and the Mount Wolseley Spa and Golf Resort.

==Culture and Heritage==

The patrimony of the Butlers of Ormond encompassed parts of County Carlow as well as most of the modern counties of Tipperary and Kilkenny, and all three counties share a similarly styled coat of arms which reflect the Butler dynasty. Their first recorded use was in 1665, collectively making them the oldest county coats of arms in Ireland. Most other counties adopted a coat of arms after independence, whereas Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary continue to use their historic Butler-era coat of arms.

The county&#x27;s coat of arms comprises an Ermine field – a white background with a pattern of black shapes representing the winter coat of the stoat. The linings of medieval coronation cloaks and some other garments, usually reserved for use by high-ranking peers such as the Butlers, were made by sewing many ermine furs together to produce a luxurious white fur with patterns of hanging black-tipped tails.

There are two further symbols per Fess. On the left side, a red lions rampant, the heraldic symbol of the branch of the Butler dynasty which resided within Carlow. On the right side, two lions passant from the coat of arms of Normandy, which symbolise that the Butlers derived their authority from the Angevin monarch. This latter symbol makes Carlow&#x27;s coat of arms unique in the Republic of Ireland, where British monarchical emblems are not typically present on local or national government seals.

In Gaelic games, the county flag was first adopted in 1910. The flag is a green, red and yellow tricolour adapted from the coat of arms of Carlow town. The town&#x27;s coat of arms displays a green and yellow flag with the Butler red lion in the centre, flying over Carlow Castle. The county flag has several variant forms, often displaying either the county coat of arms or the Carlow GAA logo in the middle.

===County Songs===
The Irish folk song &quot;Follow Me Up to Carlow&quot; is the county anthem, and is used for a variety of tourism and sporting purposes. However, the song itself is not actually about Carlow. It celebrates the defeat of the English army by Fiach Mac Aodh Ó Broin at the Battle of Glenmalure in 1580. A &quot;Song for Carlow&quot; competition was held in 2005 to select a new unofficial anthem based on the county. Out of 112 entries, a song entitled &quot;The Red, Yellow and Green&quot; by country singer Derek Ryan was chosen as the winner by a live audience and panel of judges. Comedian Richie Kavanagh has also written numerous songs which make reference to the county and its landmarks, including &quot;It&#x27;s Called the County Carlow&quot; and &quot;The Carlow Fence&quot; – a comedic song of admiration for the county&#x27;s unique Quaker-style decorative granite fences.

===Art and Festivals===
The VISUAL Centre is located on the Old Dublin Road in Carlow town and hosts a contemporary art museum as well as the George Bernard Shaw Theatre. Shaw had familial ties to the town and inherited properties through his mother&#x27;s family. He donated his properties to the Carlow Urban Council in 1944 for the &quot;common welfare&quot;, specifically stipulating that the properties could not be privately sold or used to subsidise the local rates.

There are a number of cultural activities and events held within the county each year. The Carlow Arts Festival has been held annually since 1979 and is aimed at promoting culture and the arts within the county. The Taste of Carlow Festival is centred around local cuisine and showcases locally produced bread, cheese, pastries and Craft Beers. The Festival of Writing and Ideas is held each year on the grounds of Borris House and features live discussions with novelists, poets and journalists.

<text>Forced perspective is a technique that employs optical illusion to make an object appear farther away, closer, larger or smaller than it actually is. It manipulates human visual perception through the use of scaled objects and the correlation between them and the vantage point of the spectator or camera. It has uses in photography, filmmaking and architecture.

==In filmmaking==
Forced perspective had been a feature of German silent films, and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; revived the practice. Movies, especially B-movies in the 1950s and 1960s, were produced on limited budgets and often featured forced perspective shots.

Forced perspective can be made more believable when environmental conditions obscure the difference in perspective. For example, the final scene of the famous movie &quot;Casablanca&quot; takes place at an airport in the middle of a storm, although the entire scene was shot in a studio. This was accomplished by using a painted backdrop of an aircraft, which was &quot;serviced&quot; by dwarfs standing next to the backdrop. A downpour (created in the studio) draws much of the viewer&#x27;s attention away from the backdrop and extras, making the simulated perspective less noticeable.

===Role of light===
Early instances of forced perspective used in low-budget motion pictures showed objects that were clearly different from their surroundings, often blurred or at a different light level. The principal cause of this was geometric. Light from a point source travels in a spherical wave, decreasing in intensity (or &quot;illuminance&quot;) as the inverse square of the distance travelled. This means that a light source must be four times as bright to produce the same illuminance at an object twice as far away. Thus to create the illusion of a distant object being at the same distance as a near object and scaled accordingly, much more light is required. When shooting with forced perspective, it&#x27;s important to have the aperture stopped down sufficiently to achieve proper depth of field (DOF), so that the foreground object and background are both sharp. Since miniature models would need to be subjected to far greater lighting than the main focus of the camera, the area of action, it is important to ensure that these can withstand the significant heat generated by the incandescent light sources typically used in film and TV production.

===In motion===
Peter Jackson&#x27;s film adaptations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; make extended use of forced perspective. Characters apparently standing next to each other would be displaced by several feet in depth from the camera. This, in a still shot, makes some characters (Dwarves and Hobbits) appear much smaller than others. If the camera&#x27;s point of view were moved, then parallax would reveal the true relative positions of the characters in space. Even if the camera is just rotated, its point of view may move accidentally if the camera is not rotated about the correct point. This point of view is called the &#x27;zero-parallax-point&#x27; (or front nodal point), and is approximated in practice as the centre of the entrance pupil.

An extensively used technique in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; was an enhancement of this principle, which could be used in moving shots. Portions of sets were mounted on movable platforms which would move precisely according to the movement of the camera, so that the optical illusion would be preserved at all times for the duration of the shot. The same techniques were used in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; movies to make the character Rubeus Hagrid look like a giant. Props around Harry and his friends are of normal size, while seemingly identical props placed around Hagrid are in fact smaller.

===Comic effects===
As with many film genres and effects, forced perspective can be used to visual-comedy effect. Typically, when an object or character is portrayed in a scene, its size is defined by its surroundings. A character then interacts with the object or character, in the process showing that the viewer has been fooled and there is forced perspective in use.

The 1930 Laurel and Hardy movie &quot;Brats&quot; used forced perspective to depict Stan and Ollie simultaneously as adults and as their own sons. An example used for comic effect can be found in the slapstick comedy &quot;Top Secret!&quot; in a scene which appears to begin as a close-up of a ringing phone with the characters in the distance. However, when the character walks up to the phone (towards the camera) and picks it up, it becomes apparent that the phone is extremely oversized instead of being close to the camera. Another scene in the same movie begins with a close-up of a wristwatch. The next cut shows that the character actually has a gargantuan wristwatch.

The same technique is also used in the Dennis Waterman sketch in the British BBC sketch show &quot;Little Britain&quot;. In the television version, larger than life props are used to make the caricatured Waterman look just three feet tall or less. In &quot;The History of the World, Part I&quot;, while escaping the French peasants, Mel Brooks&#x27; character, Jacques, who is doubling for King Louis, runs down a hall of the palace, which turns into a ramp, showing the smaller forced perspective door at the end. As he backs down into the normal part of the room, he mutters, &quot;Who designed this place?&quot;

One of the recurring &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; sketches featured Mr. Tyzik, &quot;The Headcrusher&quot;, who used forced perspective (from his own point of view) to &quot;crush&quot; other people&#x27;s heads between his fingers. This is also done by the character Sheldon Cooper in the TV show &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; to his friends when they displease him. In the making of Season 5 of &quot;Red vs. Blue&quot;, the creators used forced perspective to make the character of Tucker&#x27;s baby, Junior, look small. In the game, the alien character used as Junior is the same height as other characters. The short-lived 2013 Internet meme &quot;baby mugging&quot; used forced perspective to make babies look like they were inside items like mugs and teacups.

==In architecture==

In architecture, a structure can be made to seem larger, taller, farther away or otherwise by adjusting the scale of objects in relation to the spectator, increasing or decreasing perceived . When forced perspective is supposed to make an object appear farther away, the following method can be used: by constantly decreasing the scale of objects from expectancy and convention toward the farthest point from the spectator, an illusion is created that the scale of said objects is decreasing due to their distant location. In contrast, the opposite technique was sometimes used in classical garden designs and other follies to shorten the perceived distances of points of interest along a path.

The Statue of Liberty is built with a slight forced perspective so that it appears more correctly proportioned when viewed from its base. When the statue was designed in the late 19th century (before easy air flight), there were few other angles from which to view the statue. This caused a difficulty for special effects technicians working on the movie &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, who had to reduce the amount of forced perspective used when replicating the statue for the movie so that their model (which was photographed head-on) would not look top-heavy. This effect can also be seen in Michelangelo&#x27;s statue of &quot;David&quot;.

==Through depth perception==

The technique takes advantage of the visual cues humans use to perceive depth such as angular size, aerial perspective, shading, and relative size. In film, photography and art, perceived object distance is manipulated by altering fundamental monocular cues used to discern the depth of an object in the scene such as aerial perspective, blurring, relative size and lighting. Using these monocular cues in concert with angular size, the eyes can perceive the distance of an object. Artists are able to freely move the visual plane of objects by obscuring these cues to their advantage.

Increasing the object&#x27;s distance from the audience makes an object appear smaller, its apparent size decreases as distance from the audience increases. This phenomenon is that of the manipulation of angular and apparent size.

A person perceives the size of an object based on the size of the object&#x27;s image on the retina. This depends solely on the angle created by the rays coming from the topmost and bottommost part of the object that pass through the center of the lens of the eye. The larger the angle an object subtends, the larger the apparent size of the object. The subtended angle increases as the object moves closer to the lens. Two objects with different actual size have the same apparent size when they subtend the same angle. Similarly, two objects of the same actual size can have drastically varying apparent size when they are moved to different distances from the lens.

===Calculating angular size===

The formula for calculating angular size is as follows:
:formula_1

in which &quot;θ&quot; is the subtended angle, &quot;h&quot; is the actual size of the object and &quot;D&quot; is the distance from the lens to the object.

===Techniques employed===
* Solely manipulating angular size by moving objects closer and farther away cannot fully trick the eye. Objects that are farther away from the eye have a lower luminescent contrast due to atmospheric scattering of rays. Fewer rays of light reach the eye from more distant objects. Using the monocular cue of aerial perspective, the eye uses the relative luminescence of objects in a scene to discern relative distance. Filmmakers and photographers combat this cue by manually increasing the luminescence of objects farther away to equal that of objects in the desired plane. This effect is achieved by making the more distant object more bright by shining more light on it. Because luminance decreases by ½&quot;d&quot; (where &quot;d&quot; is distance from the eye), artists can calculate the exact amount of light needed to counter the cue of aerial perspective.
* Similarly, blurring can create the opposite effect by giving the impression of depth. Selectively blurring an object moves it out of its original visual plane without having to manually move the object.
* A perceptive illusion that may be infused in film culture is the idea of Gestalt psychology, which holds that people often view the whole of an object as opposed to the sum of its individual parts.
* Another monocular cue of depth perception is that of lighting and shading. Shading in a scene or on an object allows the audience to locate the light source relative to the object. Making two objects at different distances have the same shading gives the impression that they are in similar positions relative to the light source; therefore, they appear closer to each other than they actually are.
* Artists may also employ the simpler technique of manipulating relative size. Once the audience becomes acquainted with the size of an object in proportion to the rest of the objects in a scene, the photographer or filmmaker can replace the object with a larger or smaller replica to change another part of the scene&#x27;s apparent size. This is done frequently in movies. For example, to aid in the appearance of a person as a giant next to a &quot;regular sized&quot; person, a filmmaker might have a shot of two identical glasses together, then follow with the person who is supposed to play the giant holding a much smaller replica of the glass and the person who is playing the regular-sized person holding a much larger replica. Because the audience sees that the glasses are the same size in the original shot, the difference in relation to the two characters allows the audience to perceive the characters as different sizes based on their relative size to the glasses they hold.
* A painter can give the illusion of distance by adding blue or red tinting to the color of the object he is painting. This monocular cue takes advantage of the trend for the color of distant objects to shift towards the blue end of the spectrum, while the colors of closer objects shift toward the red end of the spectrum. The optical phenomenon is known as chromostereopsis.

=== Examples ===

====In film====
Forced perspective has been employed to realize characters in film. One notable example is Rubeus Hagrid, the half-giant in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series.

The technique is used in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series for depicting the apparent heights of the hobbit characters, such as Frodo, who are supposed to be around half the height or less of the humans and wizards, such as Gandalf. In reality, the difference in height between the respective actors playing those roles is only , where Elijah Wood as the hobbit Frodo is tall, and Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf is . The use of camera angles and trick scenery and props creates the illusion of a much greater difference in size and height.

Numerous camera angle tricks are played in the comedy film &quot;Elf&quot; (2003) to make the elf characters in the movie appear smaller than the human characters.

====In art====

In his painting entitled &quot;Still life with a curtain&quot;, Paul Cézanne creates the illusion of depth by using brighter colors on objects closer to the viewer and dimmer colors and shading to distance the &quot;light source&quot; from objects that he wanted to appear farther away. His shading technique allows the audience to discern the distance between objects due to their relative distances from a stationary light source that illuminates the scene. Furthermore, he uses a blue tint on objects that should be farther away and redder tint to objects in the foreground.

====Full size dioramas====
Modern museum dioramas may be seen in most major natural history museums. Typically, these displays use a tilted plane to represent what would otherwise be a level surface, incorporate a painted background of distant objects, and often employ false perspective, carefully modifying the scale of objects placed on the plane to reinforce the illusion through depth perception in which objects of identical real-world size placed farther from the observer appear smaller than those closer. Often the distant painted background or sky will be painted upon a continuous curved surface so that the viewer is not distracted by corners, seams, or edges. All of these techniques are means of presenting a realistic view of a large scene in a compact space. A photograph or single-eye view of such a diorama can be especially convincing since in this case there is no distraction by the binocular perception of depth.

Carl Akeley, a naturalist, sculptor, and taxidermist, is credited with creating the first ever habitat diorama in the year 1889. Akeley&#x27;s diorama featured taxidermied beavers in a three-dimensional habitat with a realistic, painted background. With the support of curator Frank M. Chapman, Akeley designed the popular habitat dioramas featured at the American Museum of Natural History. Combining art with science, these exhibitions were intended to educate the public about the growing need for habitat conservation. The modern AMNH Exhibitions Lab is charged with the creation of all dioramas and otherwise immersive environments in the museum.

====Theme parks====
Forced perspective is extensively employed at theme parks and other such architecture as found in Disneyland and Las Vegas, often to make structures seem larger than they are in reality where physically larger structures would not be feasible or desirable, or to otherwise provide an optical illusion for entertainment value. Most notably, it is used by Walt Disney Imagineering in the Disney Theme Parks. Some notable examples of forced perspective in the parks, used to make the objects bigger, are the castles (Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Belle, Magical Dreams, and Enchanted Storybook). One of the most notable examples of forced perspective being used to make the object appear smaller is The American Adventure pavilion in Epcot.

<doc id="184073" wikidata="Q156005" url="?curid=184073" title="Ebony">
<text>Ebony is a dense black/brown hardwood, coming from several species in the genus &quot;Diospyros&quot;, which also includes the persimmon tree. A few &quot;Diospyros&quot; species, such as macassar and mun ebony, are dense enough to sink in water. Ebony is finely textured and has a mirror finish when polished, making it valuable as an ornamental wood. It is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;ebony&quot; comes from the Ancient Egyptian &#x27;, through the Ancient Greek (&#x27;), into Latin () and Middle English.

== Species ==
Species of ebony include &quot;Diospyros ebenum&quot; (Ceylon ebony), native to southern India and Sri Lanka; &quot;D. crassiflora&quot; (Gabon ebony), native to western Africa; &quot;D. humilis&quot; (Queensland ebony), native to Queensland, the Northern Territory, New Guinea and Timor; and &quot;D. celebica&quot; (Sulawesi ebony), native to Indonesia and prized for its luxuriant, multi-colored wood grain. Mauritius ebony, &quot;D. tessellaria&quot;, was largely exploited by the Dutch in the 17th century. Some species in the genus yield an ebony with similar physical properties, but striped rather than the even black of &quot;D. ebenum&quot;.

== Uses ==
Ebony has a long history of use, and carved pieces have been found in Ancient Egyptian tombs.

By the end of the 16th century, fine cabinets for the luxury trade were made of ebony in Antwerp. The wood&#x27;s dense hardness lent itself to refined moldings framing finely detailed pictorial panels with carving in very low relief (bas-relief), usually of allegorical subjects, or with scenes taken from classical or Christian history. Within a short time, such cabinets were also being made in Paris, where their makers became known as &quot;ébénistes&quot;, which remains the French term for a cabinetmaker.

Modern uses are largely restricted to small items, such as crucifixes, the main body of some musical instruments such as the clarinet, oboe, or piccolo and musical instrument parts, including black piano, organ, and harpsichord keys; violin, viola, mandolin, guitar, double bass, and cello fingerboards; tailpieces; tuning pegs; chinrests; and bow frogs. Many plectrums, or guitar picks, are made from ebony.

Traditionally, black chess pieces were made from ebony, with boxwood or ivory being used for the white pieces. Modern East Midlands-style lace-making bobbins, also being small, are often made of ebony and look particularly decorative when bound with brass or silver wire. Some expensive handgun grips and rifle fore-end tips are still made of ebony, as are the butts of pool cues.

As a result of unsustainable harvesting, many species yielding ebony are now considered threatened. Most indigenous ebony in Africa in particular has been cut down illegally.

Ebony is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world, along with African blackwood, sandalwood, pink ivory and agarwood.

==Protection==
In 2011, the Gibson Guitar company was raided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service for violations of the Lacey Act of 1900, which prohibits the illegal importation of threatened woods and other materials.

An ebony and rosewood expert at the Missouri Botanical Garden calls the Madagascar wood trade the &quot;equivalent of Africa&#x27;s blood diamonds&quot;.

<text>The Araliaceae are a family of flowering plants composed of about 43 genera and around 1500 species consisting of primarily woody plants and some herbaceous plants commonly called the ginseng family. The morphology of Araliaceae varies widely, but it is predominantly distinguishable based on its woody habit, tropical distribution, and the presence of simple umbels.

There are numerous plants of economic importance. Some genera, such as &quot;Hedera&quot; (the ivies), &quot;Fatsia&quot; (Japanese aralias) and &quot;Heptapleurum&quot; (formerly &quot;Schefflera&quot;, the umbrella trees), are used as ornamental foliage plants. The family also includes &quot;Panax ginseng&quot;, the root of which is ginseng, used in traditional Chinese medicine.

==Overview==
The morphology of Araliaceae varies widely. Many studies have found that there is no unifying characteristic capable of classifying the family. In general, Araliaceae species have large, usually alternate leaves, often with aromatic ethereal oils, five-petaled flowers, two to five carpels, simple umbels, and berries without carpophores or oil cavities. Some taxa carry prickles, and the family is often woody but also occasionally herbaceous. While Araliaceae is predominantly a tropical family, some taxa are also endemic to temperate climates. They are found in the Americas, Eurasia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Pacific islands.

Some examples of Araliaceae include the angelica tree (&quot;Aralia spinosa&quot;), the devil&#x27;s club (&quot;Oplopanax horridus&quot;), ivy (&quot;Hedera&quot; spp., including&quot; H. helix&quot;), and herbs such as ginseng (&quot;Panax&quot; spp.). Leaves are sometimes lauroid (resembling &quot;Laurus&quot;) and are simple to compound; when compound, they are ternate, pinnate, or palmate.

Araliaceae are found in the pluvial montane forest, very humid montane forest, and humid lowland river forest regions. They are also present in laurel forest, cloud forest, and warm, humid habitats.

== Taxonomy and Systematics ==
Araliaceae is one of six angiosperm families recognized by APG IV belonging to the Apiales, an order within the Asterids. Araliaceae is accepted to be a monophyletic branch within the Apiales.

Within Araliaceae, there are four accepted groups:

1. The Greater &quot;Raukaua&quot; group, sister to the rest of the main Araliaceae clades.

2. The Aralia-Panax group, consisting of the mostly monophyletic genera &quot;Aralia&quot; and &quot;Panax.&quot;

3. The Polyscias-Pseudopanax group, sister to both genus &quot;Cussonia&quot; and the Asian Palmate group.

4. The Asian Palmate group, largest of the groups representing Araliaceae.

There are also multiple taxa that float around these groups, but are not within them.

The generic level classification of the Araliaceae has been unstable and remains under study. For instance, numerous genera have been synonymized under &quot;Schefflera&quot;, within which about half the species within Araliaceae are placed. Recent molecular phylogenies have shown that this large pantropical genus is polyphyletic and some believe it should be divided again into several genera, though these would probably not correspond with the previously recognized genera.

Recent molecular systematics techniques have made major improvements into understanding of the evolution of Araliaceae, leading to the knowledge existing today. Due to widely varying morphological characters, the systematics of Araliaceae had been largely debated over the past century, especially in the absence of molecular evidence. For instance, Araliaceae were previously merged into the closely related Apiaceae (synonym: Umbelliferae) in some taxonomic treatments that have since been rejected. The family is closely related to the Apiaceae and Pittosporaceae, but some of the exact boundaries between Araliaceae and the other families of Apiales are still uncertain and are currently being examined.

One example group that proved problematic for Araliaceae systematics is subfamily Hydrocotyloideae. Molecular phylogenies suggest at least some of the genera traditionally spanning across Araliaceae and Apiaceae as Hydrocotyloideae appear to be more closely related to Araliaceae. It has been recommended that subfamily Hydrocotyloideae be narrowed to just include genera &quot;Hydrocotyle,&quot; &quot;Trachymene,&quot; and &quot;Harmsiopanax&quot; to form a monophyletic group in Araliaceae.
