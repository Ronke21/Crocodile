<text>Holstein (; ; ; ; ) is the region between the rivers Elbe and Eider. It is the southern half of Schleswig-Holstein, the northernmost state of Germany.

Holstein once existed as the German County of Holstein (; 811–1474), the later [[Duchy of Holstein]] (; 1474–1866), and was the northernmost territory of the Holy Roman Empire. The history of Holstein is closely intertwined with the history of the Danish Duchy of Schleswig (). The capital of Holstein is Kiel.

Holstein&#x27;s name comes from the Holcetae, a Saxon tribe mentioned by Adam of Bremen as living on the north bank of the Elbe, to the west of Hamburg. The name means &quot;dwellers in the wood&quot; or &quot;hill-sitters&quot; (Northern Low Saxon: ; ).
==History==

===Origins===
After the Migration Period of the Early Middle Ages, Holstein was adjacent to the Obotrites on the coast of the Baltic Sea and the land of the Danes in Jutland.

With the conquest of Old Saxony by Charlemagne &quot;circa&quot; 800, he granted the land north of the Eider River (Schleswig) to the Danes by the Treaty of Heiligen signed in 811. The ownership of what would late become eastern Holstein (districts of Plön and Ostholstein) was given to the Obotrites, namely the Wagrians, and the Saxon elite was deported to various areas of the empire. After 814, however, the Saxons were restored to Western Holstein. The Wagrians were pushed out of the Limes Saxoniae - the new border running from the Elbe River near Boizenburg northwards along the Bille River to the mouth of the Schwentine at the Kiel Fjord and the Baltic Sea. For the following 300 years, Holstein continued to be a part of Saxony.

===County of Holstein===
The new county of Holstein was established in 1111; it was first a fief of the Duchy of Saxony. After that, it belonged to the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, and finally it came into a possession of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck. 

With the establishment of the new territorial unit, expansion to the East began and the Wagrians were finally defeated in 1138.

The County of Holstein was ruled by the House of Schaumburg; the first count was Adolf I, Count of Holstein. 

Holstein was temporarily occupied by Denmark after the Battle of Stellau (1201), but was reconquered by the Count of Schauenburg and his allies in the Battle of Bornhöved (1227).

===Partitions of the County of Holstein (1111–1474)===
The Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein partitioned Holstein several times among the inheriting sons into up to six lines, named after their towns of residence: 
* Holstein-Itzehoe, branch county between 1261 and 1290, partitioned from Holstein, repartitioned into Holstein-Pinneberg, Holstein-Plön and Holstein-Rendsburg
* Holstein-Kiel, branch county between 1261 and 1390, partitioned from Holstein, in 1273 Holstein-Segeberg (first) was partitioned from Holstein-Kiel, but reverted in 1308, but then lost to Holstein-Pinneberg, Holstein-Plön and Holstein-Rendsburg in 1316; Holstein-Kiel acquired Holstein-Plön in 1350, and merged itself into Holstein-Rendsburg
* Holstein-Pinneberg, branch county between 1290 and 1640, partitioned from Holstein-Itzehoe, acquired a share of Holstein-Segeberg in 1316, merged into the Duchy of Holstein
* Holstein-Plön, branch county between 1290 and 1390, partitioned from Holstein-Itzehoe, acquired a share of Holstein-Segeberg in 1316, merged into Holstein-Kiel
* Holstein-Rendsburg, branch county between 1290 and 1474, partitioned from Holstein-Itzehoe, acquired a share of Holstein-Segeberg (first) in 1316, and Holstein-Kiel in 1390, in 1381/1384 Holstein-Segeberg (second) was partitioned from Holstein-Rendsburg, but reverted in 1403, elevated to ducal rank in 1474
* Holstein-Segeberg (first), branch county between 1273 and 1308, partitioned from and reverted to Holstein-Kiel, but seized by allied Holstein-Pinneberg, Holstein-Plön, and Holstein-Rendsburg, partitioning Segeberg in three shares, each merged into one of the lines in 1316
* Holstein-Segeberg (second), branch county between 1381/1384 and 1403, partitioned from and reverted to Holstein-Rendsburg

In 1386 King Oluf II of Denmark and his mother, Queen Margaret I, enfeoffed in Nyborg Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg and his cognatic successors with the Duchy of Schleswig. He thus became as Gerhard II duke of Schleswig. Until 1390 the Rendsburg branch united by inheritance all branches except of that of Holstein-Pinneberg.

When the Holstein-Rendsburg line of the Schauenburg counts became extinct with the death of Adolf VIII of Holstein-Rendsburg (and in personal union as Adolf I Duke of Schleswig) in 1459, Christian I of Denmark inherited – from his maternal uncle Adolf I – the Duchy of Schleswig, a Danish fief. Through the Treaty of Ribe (1460) Christian was elected Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, then still a Saxe-Lauenburgian subfief within the Holy Roman Empire.

===Duchy of Holstein===

In 1474 Lauenburg&#x27;s liege lord, the German Emperor Frederick III, elevated Christian I as Count of Holstein-Rendsburg to Duke of Holstein, thus becoming an immediate imperial (&quot;reichsunmittelbar&quot;) vassal (see imperial immediacy). The Duchy of Holstein retained that status until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.

===Partitions of the Duchy of Holstein (1474–1866)===

In 1490, the Duchy of Holstein was divided into Holstein-Segeberg and Holstein-Gottorp. Holstein-Segeberg remained with the Danish king and was also known as Royal Holstein; later it came to be known as Holstein-Glückstadt. Holstein-Gottorp, also known as Ducal Holstein, was given to a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg, to which the kings of Denmark belonged.

Between 1533 and 1544 King Christian III of Denmark ruled the entire Duchies of Holstein and of Schleswig also in the name of his then still minor half-brothers John the Elder and Adolf. In 1544 they partitioned the Duchies of Holstein (a fief of the Holy Roman Empire) and of Schleswig (a Danish fief) in an unusual way, following negotiations between the brothers and the Estates of the Realm of the duchies, which had constituted in 1460 by the Treaty of Ribe and strictly opposed a factual partition. The elder three brothers determined their youngest brother Frederick for a career as Lutheran administrator of an ecclesiastical state within the Holy Roman Empire.

So the revenues of the duchies were divided in three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and landed estates to each of the elder brothers, while other general revenues, such as taxes from towns and customs dues, were levied together but then shared among the brothers. The estates, whose revenues were assigned to the parties, made Holstein and Schleswig look like patchworks, technically inhibiting the emergence of separate new duchies, as intended by the estates of the duchies. The secular rule in the fiscally divided duchies thus became a condominium of the parties. As dukes of Holstein and Schleswig the rulers of both houses bore the formal title of &quot;Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Ditmarsh and Stormarn&quot;. The three shares are usually called:

* Gottorp ducal share in Holstein and Schleswig, partitioned from ducal Holstein in 1544, acquired half of Haderslev share in 1581 (thus thereafter simply called ducal share), merged into the royal share in 1773 with its ruler receiving in return the prior Danish-held County of Oldenburg.
* Haderslev ducal share in Holstein and Schleswig, partitioned from ducal Holstein in 1544, halved between Gottorp and royal share in 1581
* Royal share in Holstein and Schleswig, acquired half of Haderslev share in 1581, the County of Holstein-Pinneberg in 1640 and the Gottorp share in 1713 (northern part) and 1773 (southern part), thus then comprising all of Holstein. Between 1648 and 1773 the royal share used to be called Holstein-Glückstadt after its capital Glückstadt. Parts of the former County of Holstein-Pinneberg were transformed 1649/50 into the Imperial County of Rantzau, which fell back to the Danish Crown in 1726.

The dynastic name Holstein-Gottorp comes as convenient usage from the technically more correct Duke of Schleswig and Holstein at Gottorp. Adolf, the third son of Duke and King Frederick I and the second youngest half-brother of King Christian III, founded the dynastic branch called House of Holstein-Gottorp, which is a cadet branch of the then royal Danish House of Oldenburg. The Danish monarchs and the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp ruled both duchies together as to general government, however, collected their revenues in their separate estates. John the Elder conveniently called Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev produced no issue, so no branch emerged from his side.

Similar to the above-mentioned agreement Christian III&#x27;s youngest son John the Younger gained for him and his heirs a share in Holstein&#x27;s and Schleswig&#x27;s revenues in 1564, comprising a third of the royal share, thus a ninth of Holstein and Schleswig as to the fiscal point of view. John the Younger and his heirs, however, had no share in the condominial rule, so they were not ruling but mere titular dukes.

The share of John the Elder, who died in 1581, was halved between Adolf and Frederick II, thus increasing again the royal share by a fiscal sixth of Holstein and Schleswig. As an effect the complicated fiscal division of both separate duchies, Holstein and Schleswig, with shares of each party scattered in both duchies, provided them with a condominial government binding both together, partially superseding their legally different affiliation as Holy Roman and Danish fiefs.

The County of Holstein-Pinneberg, which had remained a separately ruled territory in Holstein until its line was extinct in 1640, was merged into the then royal share of the Duchy of Holstein. The Duke of Holstein-Gottorp became emperor of Russia in 1762 as Peter III and was planning an attack on Denmark to recover the Holstein-Gottorp lands possessions in Schleswig, which were seized by the Danish king in 1713. Although Peter was soon overthrown by his wife, Catherine the Great, the Danes determined to rid themselves of this problem. In 1773, they exchanged the County of Oldenburg for the Gottorp lands in Holstein, bringing all of Holstein under their control. Thus, Holstein was again united in one state.

The territory of Holstein was enlarged by the conquest of the independent Republic of Dithmarschen in 1559, which was divided among the three ducal houses. After 1581 the southern part remained to the Danish Crown, the northern part was ruled by the House of Gottorp until 1773.

===United Holstein===
With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 Holstein&#x27;s imperial vassal status turned void. It thus became a sovereign state. Because of its personal union with Denmark, the Duchy of Holstein did not come under French occupation during the Napoleonic era (however, the neighboring duchy of Lauenburg was annexed by France in 1811 and became a part of Bouches-de-l&#x27;Elbe). From 1815 to 1864 it was a member of the German Confederation, though still in personal union with Denmark (the King of Denmark being also Duke of Holstein).

 Following the death of King Frederick VII of Denmark (House of Oldenburg) in 1863, the inheritance of Schleswig and Holstein was disputed. The new king, Christian IX (House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg), made his claim to the Danish throne through a female line. The Duke of Augustenborg, a minor scion from another cadet line of the House of Oldenburg, claimed the Duchies, and soon the German Confederation, led by Prussia and Austria, went to the Second Schleswig War with Denmark, quickly defeating it in 1864 and forcing it to cede the duchies.

However, the duchies were not given to the Duke of Augustenborg. In 1865 an arrangement was worked out between Prussia and Austria where the Austrians occupied and administered Holstein, while the Prussians did the same in Schleswig. This arrangement came to an end with the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, which resulted in Schleswig and Holstein both being incorporated into Prussia as the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. Holstein, meanwhile including former Saxe-Lauenburg (as of 1876) and the former Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck and Region of Lübeck (both as of 1937) regained statehood, now united with Schleswig, in 1946, when the British occupation government elevated the province to the State of Schleswig-Holstein, followed by the official dissolution of Prussia in 1947.

==Geography==
As of 1864, Holstein bordered Denmark in the north, the Principality of Lübeck (formerly the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg), the Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck, and the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg in the east, and the Kingdom of Hanover and the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg in the south. It also borders the North Sea in the west and the Baltic Sea in the east. Its only major island is Fehmarn, originally a part of the Duchy of Schleswig until 1867.

Cities in Holstein included Kiel, Altona, Glückstadt, Rendsburg, Segeberg, Heiligenhafen, Oldenburg in Holstein, and Plön. It had an area of 8,385 km2.

<text>Fecal incontinence (FI), or in some forms, encopresis, is a lack of control over defecation, leading to involuntary loss of bowel contents — including flatus (gas), liquid stool elements and mucus, or solid feces. FI is a sign or a symptom, not a diagnosis. Incontinence can result from different causes and might occur with either constipation or diarrhea. Continence is maintained by several interrelated factors, including the anal sampling mechanism, and incontinence usually results from a deficiency of multiple mechanisms. The most common causes are thought to be immediate or delayed damage from childbirth, complications from prior anorectal surgery (especially involving the anal sphincters or hemorrhoidal vascular cushions), altered bowel habits (e.g., caused by irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn&#x27;s disease, ulcerative colitis, food intolerance, or constipation with overflow incontinence). Reported prevalence figures vary: an estimated 2.2% of community-dwelling adults are affected, while 8.39% among non-institutionalized U.S adults between 2005 and 2010 has been reported, and among institutionalized elders figures come close to 50%.

Fecal incontinence has three main consequences: local reactions of the perianal skin and urinary tract, including maceration (softening and whitening of the skin due to continuous moisture), urinary tract infections, or decubitus ulcers (pressure sores); a financial expense for individuals (due to the cost of medication and incontinence products, and loss of productivity), employers (days off), and medical insurers and society generally (health care costs, unemployment); and an associated decrease in quality of life. There is often reduced self-esteem, shame, humiliation, depression, a need to organize life around easy access to a toilet, and avoidance of enjoyable activities. FI is an example of a stigmatized medical condition, which creates barriers to successful management and makes the problem worse. People may be too embarrassed to seek medical help and attempt to self-manage the symptom in secrecy from others.

FI is one of the most psychologically and socially debilitating conditions in an otherwise healthy individual and is generally treatable. More than 50% of hospitalized seriously ill patients rated bladder or fecal incontinence as &quot;worse than death&quot;. Management may be achieved through an individualized mix of dietary, pharmacologic, and surgical measures. Health care professionals are often poorly informed about treatment options, and may fail to recognize the effect of FI.
== Signs and symptoms ==

FI affects virtually all aspects of peoples&#x27; lives, greatly diminishing physical and mental health, and affecting personal, social, and professional life. Emotional effects may include stress, fearfulness, anxiety, exhaustion, fear of public humiliation, feeling dirty, poor body image, reduced desire for sex, anger, humiliation, depression, isolation, secrecy, frustration, and embarrassment. Some patients cope by controlling their emotions or behavior. Physical symptoms such as skin soreness, pain and odor may also affect quality of life. Physical activity such as shopping or exercise is often affected. Travel may be affected, requiring careful planning. Working is also affected for most. Relationships, social activities and self-image likewise often suffer. Symptoms may worsen over time.

== Causes ==
FI is a sign or a symptom, not a diagnosis, and represents an extensive list of causes. Usually, it is the result of a complex interplay of several coexisting factors, many of which may be simple to correct. Up to 80% of people may have more than one abnormality that is contributing. Deficits of individual functional components of the continence mechanism can be partially compensated for a certain period, until the compensating components themselves fail. For example, obstetric injury may precede onset by decades, but postmenopausal changes in the tissue strength reduce in turn the competence of the compensatory mechanisms. The most common factors in the development are thought to be obstetric injury and after-effects of anorectal surgery, especially those involving the anal sphincters and hemorrhoidal vascular cushions. The majority of incontinent persons over the age of 18 fall into one of several groups: those with structural anorectal abnormalities (sphincter trauma, sphincter degeneration, perianal fistula, rectal prolapse), neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, spina bifida, stroke, etc.), constipation/fecal loading (presence of a large amount of feces in the rectum with stool of any consistency), cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction (dementia, learning disabilities), diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#x27;s disease), irritable bowel syndrome, disability related (people who are frail, acutely unwell, or have chronic/acute disabilities), and those cases which are idiopathic (of unknown cause). Diabetes mellitus is also known to be a cause, but the mechanism of this relationship is not well understood.

=== Childbirth ===
Vaginal delivery causes stretching of the pelvic muscles and the pudendal nerve. Obstetric injury is a leading cause of fecal incontinence. Obstetric injury may tear the anal sphincters, and some of these injuries may be occult (undetected). The risk of injury is greatest when labor has been especially difficult or prolonged, when forceps are used, with higher birth weights, or when a midline episiotomy is performed. Only when there is post-operative investigation of FI such as endoanal ultrasound is the injury discovered. Vaginal birth may lead to pudendal nerve damage. The pudendal nerve may sustain irreversible injury if it is stretched more than 12% of its original length. The nerve is especially vulnerable to stretch damage during childbirth because of the course of the nerve, as it runs in close proximity to pelvic muscles (piriformis and coccygeus) and ligaments, before exiting and then re-entering the pelvic cavity. The damage is likely to occur at the exit from the pudendal canal, because the course of the nerve is relatively fixed at this point. Stretching occurs during delivery, especially from the child&#x27;s head. The risk increases when delivering larger-than-average babies or with prolonged (especially second stage) or difficult labour. The risk of damage to the pudendal nerve is also higher if obstetrical forceps are used. 60% of females who sustained obstetric tears were demonstrated to also have pudendal nerve damage. Any damage to the pudendal nerve occurring during childbirth may not become fully apparent until years later, for example at the onset of menopause.

===Surgery===
FI is a much under-reported complication of surgery. The IAS is easily damaged with an anal retractor (especially the Park&#x27;s anal retractor), leading to reduced resting pressure postoperatively. Since the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions contribute 15% of the resting anal tone, surgeries involving these structures may affect continence status. Partial internal sphincterotomy, fistulotomy, anal stretch (Lord&#x27;s operation), hemorrhoidectomy or transanal advancement flaps may all lead to FI postoperatively, with soiling being far more common than solid FI. The &quot;keyhole deformity&quot; refers to scarring within the anal canal and is another cause of mucus leakage and minor incontinence. This defect is also described as a groove in the anal canal wall and may occur after posterior midline fissurectomy or fistulotomy, or with lateral IAS defects. There is increased risk of FI after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.

=== Anal sphincter weakness ===
The anal canal presents the final barrier to continence. The resting tone of the anal canal is not the only important factor; both the length of the high-pressure zone and its radial translation of force are required for continence. This means that even with normal anal canal pressure, focal defects such as the keyhole deformity can be the cause of substantial symptoms. External anal sphincter (EAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired voluntary control, whereas internal anal sphincter (IAS) dysfunction is associated with impaired fine-tuning of fecal control. Defects of the external anal sphincter are associated with urge incontinence. The external anal sphincter is supplied by the pudendal nerve. Damage to the nerve supply of the external anal sphincter on one side may not result in severe symptoms because there is substantial overlap in innervation by the nerves on the other side. The internal anal sphincter receives extrinsic autonomic innervation via the inferior hypogastric plexus, with sympathetic innervation derived from spinal levels L1-L2, and parasympathetic innervation derived from S2-S4. Disruption of the function of the internal anal sphincter results in reduced resting pressure in the anal canal. This is associated with passive leakage.

Lesions which mechanically interfere with, or prevent the complete closure of the anal canal can cause a liquid stool or mucous rectal discharge. Such lesions include piles (inflamed hemorrhoids), anal fissures, anal cancer, or fistulae.

Nontraumatic conditions causing anal sphincter weakness include scleroderma, damage to the pudendal nerves, and IAS degeneration of unknown cause.

=== Pelvic floor weakness and pudendal neuropathy===
Many people with FI have a generalized weakness of the pelvic floor, especially puborectalis. A weakened puborectalis leads to widening of the anorectal angle and impaired barrier to the stool in the rectum entering the anal canal, and this is associated with incontinence to solids. Abnormal descent of the pelvic floor can also be a sign of pelvic floor weakness. Abnormal descent manifests as descending perineum syndrome (&gt;4 cm perineal descent). This syndrome initially gives constipation, and later FI. The pelvic floor is innervated by the pudendal nerve and the S3 and S4 branches of the pelvic plexus. With recurrent straining, e.g. during difficult labour or long-term constipation, then stretch injury can damage the nerves supplying levator ani. If the pelvic floor muscles lose their innervation, they cease to contract and their muscle fibres are in time replaced by fibrous tissue, which is associated with pelvic floor weakness and incontinence. Increased pudendal nerve terminal motor latency may indicate pelvic floor weakness. Pudendal neuropathy (nerve damage) is detectable in up to 70% of people with FI.

===Obstructed defecation (incomplete evacuation of stool)===
Normal evacuation of rectal contents is 90100%. If there is incomplete evacuation during defecation, residual stool will be left in the rectum and threaten continence once defecation is finished. This is a feature of people with soiling secondary to obstructed defecation. Obstructed defecation is often due to anismus (paradoxical contraction or relaxation failure of the puborectalis). Whilst anismus is largely a functional disorder, organic pathologic lesions may mechanically interfere with rectal evacuation. Other causes of incomplete evacuation include non-emptying defects like a rectocele. Straining to defecate pushes stool into the rectocele, which acts like a diverticulum and causes stool sequestration. Once the voluntary attempt to defecate, albeit dysfunctional, is finished, the voluntary muscles relax, and residual rectal contents are then able to descend into the anal canal and cause leaking. The various types of prolapse of the posterior compartment (e.g. external rectal prolapse, mucosal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception &amp; solitary rectal ulcer syndrome) may also cause coexisting obstructed defecation.

=== Reduced rectal storage capacity ===
The rectum needs to be of a sufficient volume to store stool until defecation. The rectal walls need to be &quot;compliant&quot; i.e. able to distend to an extent to accommodate stool. Rectal storage capacity (i.e. rectal volume + rectal compliance) may be affected in the following ways. Surgery involving the rectum (e.g. lower anterior resection, often performed for colorectal cancer), radiotherapy directed at the rectum, and inflammatory bowel disease can cause scarring, which may result in the walls of the rectum becoming stiff and inelastic, reducing compliance. Reduced rectal storage capacity may lead to urge incontinence, where there is an urgent need to defecate as soon as stool enters the rectum, where normally stool would be stored until there was enough to distend the rectal walls and initiate the defecation cycle. Tumors and rectal strictures also may impair reservoir function.

===Rectal hyposensitivity===
Rectal sensation is required to detect the presence, nature, and amount of rectal contents. Reduced rectal sensation may be a contributory factor. If the sensory nerves are damaged, the detection of stool in the rectum is dulled or absent, and the person will not feel the need to defecate until too late. Rectal hyposensitivity may manifest as constipation, FI, or both. Rectal hyposensitivity was reported to be present in 10% of people with FI. Pudendal neuropathy is one cause of rectal hyposensitivity and may lead to fecal loading/impaction, megarectum and overflow FI (see overflow incontinence).

=== Overflow incontinence ===
This may occur when there is a large mass of feces in the rectum (fecal loading), which may become hardened (fecal impaction). Liquid stool elements can pass around the obstruction, leading to incontinence. Megarectum (enlarged rectal volume) and rectal hyposensitivity are associated with overflow incontinence. Hospitalized patients and care home residents may develop FI via this mechanism, possibly a result of lack of mobility, reduced alertness, the constipating effect of medication, and/or dehydration. In overflow incontinence, the rectum is constantly distended because of the presence of retained feces in the rectum. Therefore, the recto-anal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is persistently activated, meaning the internal anal sphincter relaxes, which is not under voluntary control.

=== Central nervous system ===
Continence requires conscious and subconscious networking of information from and to the anorectum. Defects/brain damage may affect the central nervous system focally (e.g. stroke, tumor, spinal cord lesions, trauma, multiple sclerosis) or diffusely (e.g. dementia, multiple sclerosis, infection, Parkinson&#x27;s disease or drug-induced). FI (and urinary incontinence) may also occur during epileptic seizures. Dural ectasia is an example of a spinal cord lesion that may affect continence.

=== Diarrhea ===
Liquid stool is more difficult to control than formed, solid stool. Hence, FI can be exacerbated by diarrhea. Some consider diarrhea to be the most common aggravating factor. Where diarrhea is caused by temporary problems such as mild infections or food reactions, incontinence tends to be short-lived. Chronic conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn&#x27;s disease, can cause severe diarrhea lasting for weeks or months. Diseases, drugs, and indigestible dietary fats that interfere with the intestineal absorption may cause steatorrhea (oily rectal discharge &amp; fatty diarrhea) and degrees of FI. Respective examples include cystic fibrosis, orlistat, and olestra. Postcholecystectomy diarrhea is diarrhea that occurs following gall bladder removal, due to excess bile acid. Orlistat is an anti-obesity (weight loss) drug that blocks the absorption of fats. This may give side effects of FI, diarrhea, and steatorrhea.

===Radiation===
Irradiation may occur during radiotherapy, e.g. for prostate cancer. Radiation-induced FI may involve the anal canal as well as the rectum, when proctitis, anal fistula formation, and diminished function of internal and external sphincter occur.

=== Trauma===
Fecal incontinence caused by trauma is uncommon. Rare causes of traumatic injury to the anal sphincters include military or traffic accidents complicated by pelvic fractures, spine injuries or perineal lacerations, insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and anal sexual abuse.

===Anal penetration===
Most people engaging in anal sex do not experience subsequent fecal incontinence. However, some cases of anal sex have been associated with an increased risk. Factors include high frequency, and practices such as anal fisting, psychoactive drug use and BDSM. Females have lower anal canal pressures and less robust sphincters than males, which may make them more susceptible to incontinence, particularly if coercion is involved.

=== Congenital defects===
Anorectal anomalies and spinal cord defects may be a cause in children. These are usually picked up and operated upon during early life, but continence is often imperfect thereafter.

== Pathophysiology ==

The mechanisms and factors contributing to normal continence are multiple and interrelated. The puborectalis sling, forming the anorectal angle (see diagram), is responsible for the gross continence of solid stool. The IAS is an involuntary muscle, contributing about 50-85% of the resting anal pressure. Together with the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions, the IAS maintains continence of flatus and liquid during rest. The EAS is a voluntary muscle, that doubles the pressure in the anal canal during contraction, which is possible for a short time. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is an involuntary IAS relaxation in response to rectal distension, allowing some rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where it is brought into contact with specialized sensory mucosa to detect consistency. The rectoanal excitatory reflex (RAER) is an initial, semi-voluntary contraction of the EAS and puborectalis which in turn prevents incontinence following the RAIR. Other factors include the specialized anti-peristaltic function of the last part of the sigmoid colon, which keeps the rectum empty most of the time, sensation in the lining of the rectum and the anal canal to detect when there is stool present, its consistency and quantity, and the presence of normal rectoanal reflexes and defecation cycle which completely evacuates stool from the rectum and anal canal. Problems affecting any of these mechanisms and factors may be involved in the cause.

== Diagnosis ==

Identification of the exact causes usually begins with a thorough medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication, and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assess resting pressure and voluntary contraction (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess the functioning of the anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and contraction. The procedure is also able to assess the sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects in the structure of the rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative that is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.

Functional FI is common. The Rome process published diagnostic criteria for functional FI, which they defined as &quot;recurrent uncontrolled passage of fecal material in an individual with a developmental age of at least four years&quot;. The diagnostic criteria are, one or more of the following factors present for the last three months: abnormal functioning of normally innervated and structurally intact muscles, minor abnormalities of sphincter structure/innervation (nerve supply), normal or disordered bowel habits, (i.e., fecal retention or diarrhea), and psychological causes. Furthermore, exclusion criteria are given. These are factors that all must be excluded for a diagnosis of functional FI, and are abnormal innervation caused by lesion(s) within the brain (e.g., dementia), spinal cord (at or below T12), or sacral nerve roots, or mixed lesions (e.g., multiple sclerosis), or as part of a generalized peripheral or autonomic neuropathy (e.g., due to diabetes), anal sphincter abnormalities associated with a multisystem disease (e.g., scleroderma), and structural or neurogenic abnormalities that are the major cause.

=== Definition ===

There is no globally accepted definition, but fecal incontinence is generally defined as the recurrent inability to voluntarily control the passage of bowel contents through the anal canal and expel it at a socially acceptable location and time, occurring in individuals over the age of four. &quot;Social continence&quot; has been given various precise definitions for the purposes of research; however, generally it refers to symptoms being controlled to an extent that is acceptable to the individual in question, with no significant effect on their life. There is no consensus about the best way to classify FI, and several methods are used.

Symptoms can be directly or indirectly related to the loss of bowel control. The direct (primary) symptom is a lack of control over bowel contents which tends to worsen without treatment. Indirect (secondary) symptoms, which are the result of leakage, include pruritus ani (an intense itching sensation from the anus), perianal dermatitis (irritation and inflammation of the skin around the anus), and urinary tract infections. Due to embarrassment, people may only mention secondary symptoms rather than acknowledge incontinence. Any major underlying cause will produce additional signs and symptoms, such as protrusion of mucosa in external rectal prolapse. Symptoms of fecal leakage (FL) are similar and may occur after defecation. There may be loss of small amounts of brown fluid and staining of the underwear.

=== Types ===

FI can be divided into those people who experience a defecation urge before leakage (urge incontinence), and those who experience no sensation before leakage (passive incontinence or soiling). Urge incontinence is characterized by a sudden need to defecate, with little time to reach a toilet. Urge and passive FI may be associated with weakness of the external anal sphincter (EAS) and internal anal sphincter (IAS) respectively. Urgency may also be associated with reduced rectal volume, reduced ability of the rectal walls to distend and accommodate stool, and increased rectal sensitivity.

There is a continuous spectrum of different clinical presentations from incontinence of flatus (gas), through incontinence of mucus or liquid stool, to solids. The term &quot;anal incontinence&quot; often is used to describe &quot;flatus incontinence&quot; (that is, involuntary loss of flatus). In other sources, the term &quot;anal incontinence&quot; is distinguished as involuntary loss of feces or flatus caused by loss of control of the anal sphincter; whereas &quot;fecal incontinence&quot; may be given the definition of involuntary loss of solid or liquid feces which may also be caused by enlarged skin tags, poor hygiene, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, and fistula in ano. It may occur together with incontinence of liquids or solids, or it may present in isolation. Flatus incontinence may be the first sign of FI. Once continence to flatus is lost, it is rarely restored. Anal incontinence may be equally disabling as the other types. However, the term &quot;anal incontinence&quot; is also often used interchangeably as a synonym for FI generally, and use a wider definition for FI which includes 
uncontrolled passage of feces or gas.

Fecal leakage, fecal soiling and fecal seepage are minor degrees of FI, and describe incontinence of liquid stool, mucus, or very small amounts of solid stool. They cover a spectrum of increasing symptom severity (staining, soiling, seepage, and accidents). Rarely, minor FI in adults may be described as encopresis. Fecal leakage is a related topic to rectal discharge, but this term does not necessarily imply any degree of incontinence. Discharge generally refers to conditions where there is pus or increased mucus production, or anatomical lesions that prevent the anal canal from closing fully, whereas fecal leakage generally concerns disorders of IAS function and functional evacuation disorders which cause a solid fecal mass to be retained in the rectum. Solid stool incontinence may be called complete (or major) incontinence, and anything less as partial (or minor) incontinence (i.e. incontinence of flatus (gas), liquid stool and/or mucus).

In children over the age of four who have been toilet trained, a similar condition is generally termed encopresis (or soiling), which refers to the voluntary or involuntary loss of (usually soft or semi-liquid) stool. The term pseudoincontinence is used when there is FI in children who have anatomical defects (e.g. enlarged sigmoid colon or anal stenosis). Encopresis is a term that is usually applied when there are no such anatomical defects present. The ICD-10 classifies nonorganic encopresis under &quot;behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence&quot; and organic causes of encopresis along with FI.

=== Clinical measurement ===

Several severity scales exist. The Cleveland Clinic (Wexner) fecal incontinence score takes into account five parameters that are scored on a scale from zero (absent) to four (daily) frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid, solid, of need to wear pad, and of lifestyle changes. The Park&#x27;s incontinence score uses four categories:
# those continent for solid and liquid stool and also for flatus.
# those continent for solid and liquid stool but incontinent for flatus (with or without urgency).
# those continent for solid stool but incontinent for liquid stool or flatus.
# those incontinent to formed stool (complete incontinence).
The fecal incontinence severity index is based on four types of leakage (gas, mucus, liquid stool, solid stool) and five frequencies (once to three times per month, once per week, twice per week, once per day, twice or more per day). Other severity scales include AMS, Pescatori, Williams score, Kirwan, Miller score, Saint Mark&#x27;s score, and the Vaizey scale.

=== Differential diagnosis ===

FI may present with signs similar to rectal discharge (e.g. fistulae, proctitis, or rectal prolapse), pseudoincontinence, encopresis (with no organic cause), and irritable bowel syndrome.

== Management ==


FI is generally treatable with conservative management, surgery, or both. The success of treatment depends upon the exact causes and how easily these are corrected. Treatment choice depends on the cause and severity of the disease, and the motivation and general health of the person affected. Commonly, conservative measures are used together, and if appropriate surgery is carried out. Treatments may be attempted until symptoms are satisfactorily controlled. A treatment algorithm based upon the cause has been proposed, including conservative, non-operative and surgical measures (neosphincter refers to either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial bowel sphincter, lavage refers to retrograde rectal irrigation).

Conservative measures include dietary modification, drug treatment, retrograde anal irrigation, biofeedback retraining anal sphincter exercises. Incontinence products refer to devices such as anal plugs and perineal pads and garments such as diapers/nappies. Perineal pads are efficient and acceptable for only minor incontinence. If all other measures are ineffective removing the entire colon may be an option.

=== Diet ===

Dietary modification may be important for successful management. Both diarrhea and constipation can contribute to different cases, so dietary advice must be tailored to address the underlying cause or it may be ineffective or counterproductive. In persons with disease aggravated by diarrhea or those with rectal loading by soft stools, the following suggestions may be beneficial: increase dietary fiber; reduce wholegrain cereals/bread; reduce fruit and vegetables which contain natural laxative compounds (rhubarb, figs, prunes/plums); limit beans, pulses, cabbage and sprouts; reduce spices (especially chili); reduce artificial sweeteners (e.g. sugar-free chewing gum); reduce alcohol (especially stout, beer and ale); reduce lactose if there is some degree of lactase deficiency; and reduce caffeine. Caffeine lowers the resting tone of the anal canal and also causes diarrhea. Excessive doses of vitamin C, magnesium, phosphorus and/or calcium supplements may increase FI. Reducing the olestra fat substitute, which can cause diarrhea, may also help.

=== Medication ===

Pharmacological management may include anti-diarrheal/constipating agents and laxatives/stool bulking agents. Stopping or substituting any previous medication that causes diarrhea may be helpful in some (see table). There is no good evidence for the use of any medications, however.

In people who have undergone gallbladder removal, the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine may help minor degrees of FI. Bulking agents also absorb water, so may be helpful for those with diarrhea. A common side effect is bloating and flatulence. Topical agents to treat and prevent dermatitis may also be used, such as topical antifungals when there is evidence of perianal candidiasis or occasionally mild topical anti-inflammatory medication. Prevention of secondary lesions is carried out by perineal cleansing, moisturization, and the use of a skin protectant.

=== Other measures ===

Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. glycerine or bisacodyl suppositories may be prescribed. People may have a poor resting tone of the anal canal, and consequently may not be able to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, the stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and the development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have an incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and others report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.

Biofeedback (the use of equipment to record or amplify and then feed back activities of the body) is a commonly used and researched treatment, but the benefits are uncertain. Biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered, but it is unknown if one type has benefits over another.

The role of pelvic floor exercises and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. While there may be some benefits they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle that therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people doing them. This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed, or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).

Electrical stimulation can also be applied to the anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative. In light of the above, intra-anal electrical stimulation (using an anal probe as an electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as an electrode). Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted sacral nerve stimulation may be more effective than exercises, and electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves. TENS is also sometimes used to treat FI by transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation.

In a minority of people, anal plugs may be useful for either standalone therapy or in concert with other treatments. Anal plugs (sometimes termed tampons) aim to block the involuntary loss of fecal material, and they vary in design and composition. Polyurethane plugs were reported to perform better than those made of polyvinyl-alcohol. Plugs are less likely to help those with frequent bowel movements, and many find them difficult to tolerate.

=== Surgery ===
Surgery may be carried out if conservative measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated due to a lack of good-quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, tibial nerve stimulation, correction of anorectal deformity), replacement/imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents and implantable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral nerve stimulation. If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated. Substantial muscular and/or neural defects may be treated with neosphincter initially.

== Epidemiology ==

FI is thought to be very common, but much under-reported due to embarrassment. One study reported a prevalence of 2.2% in the general population. It affects people of all ages but is more common in older adults (but it should not be considered a normal part of aging). Females are more likely to develop it than males (63% of those with FI over 30 may be female). In 2014, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that one out of every six seniors in the U.S. who lived in their own homes or apartment had FI. Men and women were equally affected. 45–50% of people with FI have severe physical and/or mental disabilities. People with dementia are four times more likely to have fecal incontinence compared to people of similar ages.

Risk factors include age, female gender, urinary incontinence, history of vaginal delivery (non-Caesarean section childbirth), obesity, prior anorectal surgery, poor general health, and physical limitations. Combined urinary and fecal incontinence is sometimes termed double incontinence, and it is more likely to be present in those with urinary incontinence.

Traditionally, FI was thought to be an insignificant complication of surgery, but it is now known that a variety of different procedures are associated with this possible complication, and sometimes at high levels. Examples are midline internal sphincterotomy (8% risk), lateral internal sphincterotomy, fistulectomy, fistulotomy (1852%), hemorrhoidectomy (33%), ileo-anal reservoir reconstruction, lower anterior resection, total abdominal colectomy, ureterosigmoidostomy, and anal dilation (Lord&#x27;s procedure, 0-50%). Some authors consider obstetric trauma to be the most common cause.

== History ==

While the first mention of urinary incontinence occurs in 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus, the first mention of FI in a medical context is unknown. For many centuries, colonic irrigation was the only treatment available. Stoma creation was described in AD 1776, FI associated with rectal prolapse in AD 1873 and anterior sphincter repair in AD 1875. During the mid 20th century, several operations were developed for instances where the sphincters were intact but weakened. Muscle transpositions using the gluteus maximus or the gracilis were devised, but did not become used widely until later. End-to-end sphincteroplasty is shown to have a high failure rate in 1940. In AD 1971, Parks and McPartlin first describe an overlapping sphincteroplasty procedure. Biofeedback is first introduced in 1974. In 1975, Parks describes post anal repair, a technique to reinforce the pelvic floor and EAS to treat idiopathic cases. Endoanal ultrasound is invented in 1991, which starts to demonstrate the high number of occult sphincter tears following vaginal deliveries. In 1994, the use of an endoanal coil during pelvic MRI shows greater detail of the anal canal than previously. During the last 20 years, dynamic graciliplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, injectable perianal bulking agents and radiofrequency ablation have been devised, mainly due to the relatively poor success rates and high morbidity associated with the earlier procedures.

== Society and culture ==

Persons with this symptom are frequently ridiculed and ostracized in public. It has been described as one of the most psychologically and socially debilitating conditions in an otherwise healthy individual. In older people, it is one of the most common reasons for admission into a care home. Persons who develop FI earlier in life are less likely to marry and obtain employment. Often, people will go to great lengths to keep their condition secret. It has been termed &quot;the silent affliction&quot; since many do not discuss the problem with their close family, employers, or clinicians. They may be subject to gossip, hostility, and other forms of social exclusion. The economic cost has not received much attention.

=== Netherlands ===

In the Netherlands, a 2004 study estimated that total costs of patients with fecal incontinence were €2169 per patient per year. Over half of this was productivity loss in work.

=== United States ===

In the US, the average lifetime cost (treatment and follow-up) was $17,166 per person in 1996. The average hospital charge for sphincteroplasty was $8555 per procedure. Overall, in the US, the total charges associated with surgery increased from $34 million in 1998 to $57.5 million in 2003. Sacral nerve stimulation, dynamic graciloplasty, and colostomy were all shown to be cost-effective.

=== Japan ===

Some insults in Japan relate to incontinence, such as &quot;kusotare/kusottare&quot; and &quot;shikkotare&quot; which mean &quot;shit hanger/leaker/oozer&quot; and &quot;piss leaker/oozer&quot; respectively, though these have not been in common use since the 1980s.

=== Law ===

The case &quot;Hiltibran et al v. Levy et al&quot; in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri resulted in that court issuing an order in 2011. That order requires incontinence briefs funded by Medicaid to be given by the State of Missouri to adults who would be institutionalized without them.

<doc id="179407" wikidata="Q312433" url="?curid=179407" title="Schlei">
<text>The Schlei (; or ) is a narrow inlet of the Baltic Sea in Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany. It stretches for approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Baltic near Kappeln and Arnis to the town of Schleswig. Along the Schlei are many small bays and swamps. It separates the Angeln peninsula to the north from the Schwansen peninsula to the south.

The important Viking settlement of Hedeby was located at the head of the firth (fjord), but was later abandoned in favor of the town of Schleswig. A museum has been built on the site, telling the story of the abandoned town.

==Etymology==
The Schlei&#x27;s name was once presumably &quot;Angel&quot;, later giving its name to the region Angeln. This name derives from the Norse word &quot;angr&quot; (&quot;narrow&quot;). &quot;Angel&quot; therefore meant &quot;narrow fjord&quot;, which fits the long and narrow Schlei well.

The current name is thought to have been used only for the inner Schlei (the broads at the top of the firth now known in Danish as the &quot;Store Bredning&quot; and &quot;Lille Bredning&quot; and in German as the &quot;Große Breite&quot; and &quot;Kleine Breite&quot;, near Schleswig). The word is thought to be connected with the Danish word &quot;slæ&quot; (&quot;reeds, water plants&quot;).

<doc id="179408" wikidata="Q380573" url="?curid=179408" title="Dorgon">
<text>Dorgon (17 November 1612 – 31 December 1650) was a Manchu prince and regent of the early Qing dynasty. Born in the House of Aisin-Gioro as the 14th son of Nurhaci (the founder of the Later Jin dynasty, which was the predecessor of the Qing), Dorgon started his career in military campaigns against the Mongols, the Koreans, and the Ming dynasty during the reign of Hong Taiji (his eighth brother) who succeeded their father.

After Hong Taiji&#x27;s death in 1643, he was involved in a power struggle against Hong Taiji&#x27;s eldest son, Hooge, over the succession to the throne. Both of them eventually came to a compromise by backing out and letting Hong Taiji&#x27;s ninth son, Fulin, become the emperor; Fulin was installed on the throne as the Shunzhi Emperor. Dorgon served as Prince-Regent from 1643 to 1650, throughout the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s early reign. In 1645, he was given the honorary title &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Uncle and Prince-Regent&quot; (皇叔父攝政王); the title was changed to &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Father and Prince-Regent&quot; (皇父攝政王) in 1649.

Under Dorgon&#x27;s regency, Qing forces occupied Beijing, the capital of the fallen Ming dynasty, and gradually conquered the rest of the Ming in a series of battles against Ming loyalists and other opposing forces around China. Dorgon also introduced the policy of forcing all Han Chinese men to shave the front of the heads and wear their hair in queues just like the Manchus. He died in 1650 during a hunting trip and was posthumously honoured as an emperor even though he was never an emperor during his lifetime. A year after Dorgon&#x27;s death, however, the Shunzhi Emperor accused Dorgon of several crimes, stripped him of his titles, and ordered his remains to be exhumed and flogged in public. Dorgon was posthumously rehabilitated and restored of his honorary titles by the Qianlong Emperor in 1778.

==Early life==
Dorgon was born in the Manchu Aisin-Gioro clan as the 14th son of Nurhaci, the Khan of the Later Jin dynasty (the precursor to the Qing dynasty). His mother was Nurhaci&#x27;s primary consort, Lady Abahai. Ajige and Dodo were his full brothers, and Hong Taiji was one of his half-brothers. Dorgon was one of the most influential among Nurhaci&#x27;s sons, and his role was instrumental to the Qing occupation of Beijing, the capital of the fallen Ming dynasty, in 1644. During Hong Taiji&#x27;s reign, Dorgon participated in many military campaigns, including the conquests of Mongolia and Korea. He fought against the Chahar Mongols in 1628 and 1635.

== Rise to power ==
After Hong Taiji died in 1643, Dorgon became involved in a power struggle with Hong Taiji&#x27;s eldest son, Hooge, over the succession to the throne. The conflict was resolved with a compromise – both backed out, and Hong Taiji&#x27;s ninth son, Fulin, ascended the throne as the Shunzhi Emperor. Since the Shunzhi Emperor was only six years old at that time, Dorgon and his cousin Jirgalang were appointed co-regents. In 1645, Dorgon was conferred the title &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Uncle and Prince-Regent&quot; (皇叔父攝政王). Later, in 1649, the title was changed to &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Father and Prince-Regent&quot; (皇父攝政王). It was rumoured that Dorgon had a romantic affair with the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s mother, Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang, and even secretly married her, but there are also refutations. Whether they secretly married, had a secret affair or kept their distance remains a controversy in Chinese history.

==Dorgon&#x27;s regency (1643–1650)==

===A quasi-emperor===
On 17 February 1644, Jirgalang, who was a capable military leader but appeared uninterested in managing state affairs, willingly yielded control of all official matters to Dorgon. After an alleged plot by Hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 May of that year, Hooge was stripped of his princely title and his co-conspirators were executed. Dorgon soon replaced Hooge&#x27;s supporters (mostly from the Yellow Banners) with his own, thus gaining closer control of two more banners. By early June 1644, he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military.

In early 1644, just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the Ming Empire, peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching Beijing. On 24 April of that year, rebel forces led by Li Zicheng breached the walls of the Ming capital. The last Ming emperor, the Chongzhen Emperor, hanged himself at a hill behind the Forbidden City. Hearing the news, Dorgon&#x27;s Han Chinese advisors Hong Chengchou and Fan Wencheng (范文程; 1597–1666) urged the prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen Ming Empire and claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing Empire. The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Wu Sangui, a former Ming general guarding the Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall. 

Wu Sangui was caught between the Manchus and Li Zicheng&#x27;s forces. He requested Dorgon&#x27;s help in ousting the rebels and restoring the Ming Empire. When Dorgon asked Wu Sangui to work for the Qing Empire instead, Wu had little choice but to accept. Aided by Wu Sangui&#x27;s elite soldiers, who fought the rebel army for hours before Dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry, the Qing army won a decisive victory against Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May. Li Zicheng and his defeated troops looted Beijing for several days until they left the capital on 4 June with all the wealth they could carry.

===Settling in the capital===
After six weeks of mistreatment at the hands of rebel troops, the residents of Beijing sent a party of elders and officials to greet their liberators on 5 June. They were startled when, instead of meeting Wu Sangui and the Ming heir apparent, they saw Dorgon, a horse-riding Manchu with the front half of his head shaved, present himself as the Prince-Regent. In the midst of this upheaval, Dorgon installed himself as Prince-Regent in Wuying Palace (武英殿), the only building that remained more or less intact after Li Zicheng had set fire to the Forbidden City on 3 June. Banner troops were ordered not to loot; their discipline made the transition to Qing rule &quot;remarkably smooth.&quot; Yet, at the same time, as he claimed to have come to avenge the Ming Empire, Dorgon ordered that all claimants to the Ming throne (including descendants of the last Ming emperor) should be executed along with their supporters.

On 7 June, just two days after entering the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population surrendered, the officials would be allowed to stay at their posts. Besides, all the men had to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues. He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing, threatening Qing control over the capital region.

Dorgon greeted the Shunzhi Emperor at the gates of Beijing on 19 October 1644. On 30 October the six-year-old monarch performed sacrifices to Heaven and Earth at the Altar of Heaven. The southern cadet branch of Confucius&#x27;s descendants who held the title &quot;wujing boshi&quot; and the northern branch 65th generation descendant of Confucius to hold the title Duke Yansheng had their titles confirmed by the Shunzhi Emperor on 31 October. A formal ritual of enthronement for the Shunzhi Emperor was held on 8 November, during which the young emperor compared Dorgon&#x27;s achievements to those of the Duke of Zhou, a revered regent of the Zhou dynasty. During the ceremony, Dorgon&#x27;s official title was raised from &quot;Prince Regent&quot; to &quot;Uncle and Prince Regent&quot; (叔父攝政王), in which the Manchu term for &quot;Uncle&quot; (&quot;ecike&quot;) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince. Three days later Dorgon&#x27;s co-regent, Jirgalang, was demoted from &quot;Prince Regent&quot; to &quot;Assistant Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (輔政叔王). In June 1645, Dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as &quot;Imperial Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (皇叔父攝政王), leaving him one step short of claiming the throne for himself.

Dorgon gave a Manchu woman as a wife to the Han Chinese official Feng Quan, who had defected from the Ming to the Qing. The Manchu queue hairstyle was willingly adopted by Feng Quan before it was enforced on the Han population and Feng learned the Manchu language.

To promote ethnic harmony, a 1648 decree from the Shunzhi Emperor allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners, it was only later in the Qing dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with. The decree was formulated by Dorgon.

One of Dorgon&#x27;s first orders in the new Qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of Beijing and give it to Bannermen, including Han Chinese Bannermen. The Yellow Banners were given the place of honor north of the palace, followed by the White Banners to the east, the Red Banners to the west, and the Blue Banners to the south. This distribution complied with the order established in the Manchu homeland before the conquest and under which &quot;each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass.&quot; Despite tax remissions and large-scale building programmes designed to facilitate the transition, in 1648 many Chinese civilians still lived among the newly arrived Banner population and there was still animosity between the two groups. Agricultural land outside the capital was also delineated (&quot;quan&quot; 圈) and given to Qing troops. Former landowners now became tenants who had to pay rent to their absentee Bannermen landlords. This transition in land use caused &quot;several decades of disruption and hardship.&quot;

In 1646, Dorgon also ordered that the imperial civil service examinations for selecting government officials be reinstated. From then on, examinations were held every three years as under the Ming Empire. In the very first imperial examination held under Qing rule in 1646, candidates, most of whom were northern Chinese, were asked how the Manchus and Han Chinese could work together for a common purpose. The 1649 examination asked &quot;how Manchus and Han Chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division.&quot; Under the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign, the average number of graduates of the metropolitan examination per session was the highest of the Qing dynasty (&quot;to win more Chinese support&quot;), continuing until 1660 when lower quotas were established.

=== Conquest of the Ming ===


Under the reign of Dorgon – whom historians have called &quot;the mastermind of the Qing conquest&quot; and &quot;the principal architect of the great Manchu enterprise&quot; – the Qing subdued almost all of China and pushed loyalist &quot;Southern Ming&quot; resistance into the far southwestern reaches of China. After repressing anti-Qing revolts in Hebei and Shandong in the summer and fall of 1644, Dorgon sent armies to root out Li Zicheng from the important city of Xi&#x27;an (Shaanxi province), where Li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing Beijing in early June 1644. Under the pressure of Qing armies, Li was forced to leave Xi&#x27;an in February 1645. He was killed – either by his own hand or by a peasant group that had organised for self-defence during this time of rampant banditry – in September 1645 after fleeing though several provinces.

From newly captured Xi&#x27;an, in early April 1645, the Qing forces mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of Jiangnan south of the lower Yangtze River, where in June 1644 the Prince of Fu had established a regime loyal to the Ming. Factional bickering and numerous defections prevented the Southern Ming from mounting an efficient resistance. Several Qing armies swept south, taking the key city of Xuzhou north of the Huai River in early May 1645 and soon converging on Yangzhou, the main city on the Southern Ming&#x27;s northern line of defence. Bravely defended by Shi Kefa, who refused to surrender, Yangzhou fell to Qing artillery on 20 May after a one-week siege. Dorgon&#x27;s brother, Dodo, then ordered the slaughter of Yangzhou&#x27;s entire population. As intended, this massacre terrorised other Jiangnan cities into surrendering to the Qing Empire. Indeed, Nanjing surrendered without a fight on 16 June after its last defenders made Dodo promise he would not harm the population. The Qing forces soon captured the Ming emperor (who died in Beijing the following year) and seized Jiangnan&#x27;s main cities, including Suzhou and Hangzhou; by early July 1645, the frontier between the Qing Empire and the Southern Ming regime had been pushed south to the Qiantang River.

On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan had been superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all Han Chinese men to shave the front half of their heads and wear the rest of their hair in queues identical to those of the Manchus. The punishment for non-compliance was death. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus distinguish friend from foe. For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one&#x27;s body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility. Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (李成東; d. 1649), respectively on 24 August and 22 September. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city walls were finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by the previous Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing Empire in the Lower Yangtze. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolise their continued defiance against Qing rule.

After the fall of Nanjing, two more members of the Ming imperial household created new Southern Ming regimes: one centred in coastal Fujian around the “Longwu Emperor” Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang, – a ninth-generation descendant of the Hongwu Emperor, the Ming dynasty&#x27;s founder – and one in Zhejiang around &quot;Regent&quot; Zhu Yihai, Prince of Lu. But the two loyalist groups failed to cooperate, making their chances of success even lower than they already were. In July 1646, a new southern campaign led by Bolo sent Prince Lu&#x27;s Zhejiang court into disarray and proceeded to attack the Longwu regime in Fujian. Zhu Yujian was caught and summarily executed in Tingzhou (western Fujian) on 6 October. His adoptive son Zheng Chenggong fled to the island of Taiwan with his fleet. Finally in November, the remaining centers of Ming resistance in Jiangxi province fell to the Qing.
In late 1646, two more Southern Ming monarchs emerged in the southern province of Guangzhou, reigning under the era names of Shaowu and Yongli. Short of official robes, the Shaowu court had to purchase from local theatre troupes. The two Ming regimes fought each other until 20 January 1647, when a small Qing force led by Li Chengdong captured Guangzhou, killed the Shaowu Emperor, and sent the Yongli court fleeing to Nanning in Guangxi. In May 1648, however, Li mutinied against the Qing Empire, and the concurrent rebellion of another former Ming general in Jiangxi helped the Yongli Emperor to retake most of south China. Li&#x27;s loyalist resurgence failed. New Qing armies managed to reconquer the central provinces of Huguang (present-day Hubei and Hunan), Jiangxi, and Guangdong in 1649 and 1650. The Yongli Emperor had to flee again. Finally on 24 November 1650, Qing forces led by Shang Kexi captured Guangzhou and massacred the city&#x27;s population, killing as many as 70,000 people. Although Dutch traveler Johan Nieuhof who witnessed the event happened claimed only 8000 people were slaughtered

Meanwhile, in October 1646, Qing armies led by Hooge reached Sichuan, where their mission was to destroy the regime of bandit chief Zhang Xianzhong. Zhang was killed in a battle against Qing forces near Xichong in central Sichuan on 1 February 1647. Also late in 1646 but further north, forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as Milayin (米喇印) revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou (Gansu). He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong (丁國棟). Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the Ming, they occupied a number of towns in Gansu, including the provincial capital Lanzhou. These rebels&#x27; willingness to collaborate with non-Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion. Both Milayin and Ding Guodong were captured and killed by Meng Qiaofang (孟喬芳; 1595–1654) in 1648, and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties.·

==Death==

Dorgon died on 31 December 1650, during a hunting trip in Kharahotun (present-day Chengde, Hebei), after sustaining injuries despite the presence of imperial doctors. He was posthumously granted the title &quot;Emperor Yi&quot; (義皇帝) and the temple name &quot;Chengzong&quot; (成宗), even though he was never emperor during his lifetime, which is unique in all history of feudal China when only direct ancestors and deceased heirs of a higher degree to an emperor (such as one&#x27;s own older brothers, one&#x27;s father&#x27;s older brothers, or one&#x27;s cousins born into such uncles) were posthumously granted the title of Emperor. The Shunzhi Emperor even bowed thrice in front of Dorgon&#x27;s coffin during the funeral.

However, the suspicion that Dorgon was actually murdered by his political enemies while being away from the heavy protection afforded him inside the Forbidden City never went away. Dorgon had 25 years of experience of horse-riding and managed to survive, on horseback, numerous battles with the Koreans, Mongols, Han Chinese rebels, as well as regular Han Chinese armies. The official Qing history claim that he injured his leg while riding on his horse and that the injuries were so severe that he could not survive the trip back to the Forbidden City, despite the presence of imperial doctors, was dubious at best. In the dry winter of northern China, the ground was not wet. Or else, it would have easily caused horses to trip. Another cause for suspicion is that Dorgon&#x27;s corpse was exhumed, flogged, and incinerated in the purge ordered by Emperor Shunzhi, a likely method camouflaged as the ultimate punishment for his alleged plot to take over the throne, in order to remove all evidence that Dorgon was murdered.

His death also took place when Emperor Shunzhi was about 13, an appropriate age for removing the regency over his head. That is, if Dorgon had died any earlier, Shunzhi would still need a regent to supervise the empire on his behalf.

==Posthumous demotion and restoration==

In 1651, Dorgon&#x27;s political enemies, led by his former co-regent Jirgalang, submitted to the Shunzhi Emperor a long memorial listing a series of crimes committed by Dorgon, which included: possession of yellow robes, which were strictly for use only by the emperor; plotting to seize the throne from the Shunzhi Emperor by calling himself &quot;Emperor&#x27;s Father&quot;; killing Hooge and taking Hooge&#x27;s wife for himself. It is difficult to prove verbal accusations made at the time when all records were ordered to be purged by the Qianlong Emperor in 1778 when he also ordered the rehabilitation of Dorgon. The last charge that Dorgon took Hooge&#x27;s wife was mostly contrived, as the Manchu tradition dating from the 12th century had allowed a male relative to marry the deceased person&#x27;s wife almost as a charitable act to save her and her children from being starved to death in the minus 20, merciless winters of the northeastern tip of China, known nowadays as Manchuria.

Jirgalang was an ally of Hooge in the 1643 bitter fight against Dorgon, who allied with his biological brothers for succession to the throne. Jirgalang had been expelled by Dorgon from the joint regency in 1646. This time, Jirgalang succeeded in convincing Emperor Shunzhi that even Dorgon&#x27;s descendants could become a threat to the throne. As a result, Shunzhi posthumously stripped Dorgon of his titles and even had Dorgon&#x27;s corpse exhumed and flogged in public. In the February 1651 imperial edict trying to justify the ultimate punishment to a dead person as well as a key member of the imperial clan, Shunzhi ordered that not only Dorgon&#x27;s name be removed from the scrolls of the imperial ancestral temple. His biological mother, Empress Xiaoliewu, got the same treatment. It was a political act to remove the legitimacy for succession to the throne by any future heir descended from Empress Xiaoliewu.

Execution of all of Dorgon&#x27;s heirs was also ordered but intentionally not recorded in official Qing history. Dorgon had two biological brothers: Ajige, the 12th son of Nurhaci and Dodo, the 15th. With Dodo dying of smallpox a few months prior to the death of Dorgon in December 1650 and the death of Ajige after he was arrested by Jirgalang&#x27;s forces and put in jail, the 1651 purge was meant to permanently eliminate the potential that a future prince descending from Empress Xiaolewu would repeat the two Dorgon competitions for succession to the throne happening in 1626, upon the death of Nurhaci, and 1643, upon the death of Hongtaiji.

However, Dorgon was posthumously rehabilitated during the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign. In 1778, the Qianlong Emperor granted Dorgon a posthumous name &quot;zhong&quot; (忠; &quot;loyal&quot;), so Dorgon&#x27;s full posthumous title became &quot;Prince Ruizhong of the First Rank&quot; (和碩睿忠親王). The word &quot;loyal&quot; was intentionally picked. It starkly testified that the charges made by Jirgalang in 1651 were all trumped up. The Qianlong Emperor, either intentionally or inadvertently, contradicted the records of the imperial ancestral temple left behind by Shunzhi when he ordered that the words &quot;Dorgon&#x27;s heirs having been exterminated&quot; (后嗣废绝) be included into official Qing history to indicate why Dorbo, a fifth generation descendant of Dodo, was designated to inherit the iron-cap princely title of Dorgon. The expression &quot;Dorgon&#x27;s heirs having been exterminated&quot; (后嗣废绝) does not carry the same meaning as &quot;Dorgon never had a son.&quot; Regardless, after a lapse of 128 years, the Qianlong Emperor could no longer find the heirs of Dorgon. The Qianlong Emperor also ordered that the rehabilitation of Dorgon be accompanied by a destruction of all the records related to the elimination of the heirs of Dorgon. This was an inglorious chapter not only of Qing history but also the history of the imperial clan of Aisin-Gioro.

==Myths about direct descendants of Dorgon ==

In the March 1651 purge of Dorgon, Shunzhi also ordered that the ancestral temple records be written to indicate that no woman had ever conceived a son for Dorgon (not that all of his sons had died due to infant mortality or some other reasons), to conceal this political conspiracy against Dorgon and his two biological brothers, who had conquered more than half of China for the young Qing empire since 1644. The extermination of Dorgon&#x27;s heirs did not include his daughter, whose birth year of 1650, the same year when Dorgon died, was allowed to be left on records. Dorgon had married at least 10 wives and concubines over a period of 25 years or more. Records in the imperial ancestral temple indicate that none of his 10 wives and concubines was able to conceive a son for Dorgon over a period of 25 years, whereas only a daughter was born at the end of this 25-year period, in the same year when he died. These records do not suggest that Dorgon was infertile.

In the midst of the 1651 purge, a son of Dorgon managed to escape from execution. He fled Beijing with the active assistance of a key member of the White Banner under the command of Dorgon when he was alive. This heir of Dorgon ran all the way to modern-day Zhongshan, Guangdong province, the southern tip of China fronting the South China Sea, where there was no more way to maximize the distance between his hiding place and the Forbidden City. He changed his family name from Aisin-Gioro to Yuan 袁 (or Yuen in the Cantonese dialect). As a Chinese character, Yuan 袁 (Yuen) substantially resembles the word &quot;Gon 袞&quot; as in &quot;Dorgon 多尔袞&quot; in the written form. After successfully escaping execution, the camouflage to re-emerge as a Han Chinese person was considered perfect, as Yuan 袁 (Yuen) was also the family name of Yuan Chonghuan 袁崇煥 the Han Chinese general who fatally wounded Nurhaci in the 1626 Battle of Ningyuan, making it highly unlikely that pursuing forces from the Forbidden City would suspect that he and/or his descendants were members of the Dorgon clan. He named the large piece of land where he finally settled Haizhou 海洲, a combination of Haixi 海西，the tribal native place of Empress Xiaoliewu, his grandmother; and Jianzhou 建洲, the tribal native place of Nurhaci, his grandfather. The village where his descendants have sprung up since 1651 was named &quot;Revelation of the Dragon 顯龍&quot;, indicating his hope that one day someone in his line would be able to reclaim the throne, which never happened through the remaining years of the Qing dynasty.

==Legacy of Dorgon==
After Dorgon led Manchu and Han Chinese troops loyal to him into Beijing on 6 June 1644, he immediately ordered restoration of order, as well as penalties for extortion and corruption activities conducted by any member of the imperial clan and other officials. Later, he declared that all Ming officials would be re-employed and the restoration of the civil service system to look for talents nationwide.

Dorgon is usually considered a good, devoted politician but he is also blamed for &quot;Six Bad Policies (六大弊政)&quot;. These were policies designed to bolster the rule of the Qing conquerors, but which caused considerable disturbance and bloodshed in China, and included:
*Forced head-shaving (剃发) and adopting Manchu clothing (易服): Chinese men were compelled to shave the front half of their heads and tie their hair in queues after the Manchu fashion, on pain of death. Massacres occurred in southern Chinese cities whose inhabitants resisted the imposition of the law. 
*Land enclosure (圈地) and requisitioning of homes (占房): to provide economic bases for the Bannermen, they were allowed to enclose &#x27;wasteland without owners&#x27; for their use; this law was however abused to take farmlands and estates which were already inhabited, with military force. 
*Forced slavery (投充) and anti-escapee (逃人) laws: in the wake of the enclosure of vast agricultural estates, the manpower was provided by allowing Bannermen to seize commoners and enslave them. This in turn necessitated decrees to tackle the problem of escapees, including summary executions of people harbouring escaped slaves and hanging for repeated escapees.

==Physical appearance==
According to the account of Japanese travellers, Dorgon was a 34- or 35-year-old man with slightly dark skin complexion and sharp eyes. He was handsome, tall and slim, and had a shiny and beautiful beard.

<text>Giuseppe Michael Agrelot Vilá (April 21, 1927 – January 28, 2004), also known as José Miguel Agrelot or Don Cholito, was a Puerto Rican comedian, radio and television host.

==Biography==
Agrelot was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was the third of four children of Felipe Antonio Agrelot Fittipaldi and Ana Luisa Vilá Cruz. His paternal grandparents were born in Lauria, Italy and immigrated to Puerto Rico in 1892, two years before his father&#x27;s birth. His sister, Ana Luisa, a teacher, later became a part-time comedic actress as well. He started working on radio stations when he was 14. At that time, he was employed by radio entrepreneur Tomás Muñiz, then the general manager of WIAC-AM and the father of later producer and actor Tommy Muñiz. During this period Agrelot developed his first comedic character, &quot;Torito Fuertes&quot;, a mischievous eight-year-old for a family comedy show sponsored by Borden, Inc. and its evaporated milk (the name Torito Fuertes was a pun on &quot;strong calf&quot;, a desirable consequence of drinking good milk). The character later took a life of his own on a radio show first named &quot;El Profesor Colgate&quot; (sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive&#x27;s flagship toothpaste) and later called &quot;El Colegio de la Alegría&quot; (&quot;The School of Joy&quot;). This program featured Tommy Muñiz as the schoolteacher of a rather dysfunctional classroom.

Apart from appearances in numerous commercials, Agrelot&#x27;s credits in Puerto Rican television included:

*&quot;La Criada Malcriada&quot; (&quot;The Rude Maid&quot;)
*&quot;El Especial de Corona&quot; (&quot;The Corona Special&quot;)
*&quot;Desafiando a los Genios&quot; (&quot;Challenging The Geniuses&quot;), a personal favorite of Pablo Casals
*&quot;Haciendo Historia&quot; (&quot;Making History&quot;)
*&quot;El Show del Mediodia&quot; (&quot;The Midday show&quot;, as &quot;Don Cholito&quot;, another legendary character of his)
*&quot;Parece Increible&quot; (&quot;It Seems Incredible&quot;)
*&quot;Ja ja, Ji ji, Jo jo con Agrelot&quot;

==Comedic characters==
Agrelot created the following characters:

*&quot;Don Pulula&quot;, a mild mannered evangelical pastor with a proclivity for mild double entendres (he modeled his voice after that of Rafael Quiñones Vidal, a Puerto Rican television host),
*&quot;Mario Trauma&quot;, a crazed mental patient who constantly screamed in falsetto and was in reality saner than the people around him (he modeled his voice after a floor coordinator at WAPA-TV),
*&quot;Pasión&quot;, an old maid desperately looking for male company,
*&quot;Serafín Sin Fin y Sin Meta&quot;, an effeminate man with a heart-shaped birthmark in his cheek (while claiming that Serafín was not a homosexual and never made a pass to anyone during the character&#x27;s run, Agrelot faced protests from the local chapter of GLAAD and discontinued the character)
*&quot;Soldado Manteca&quot;, an inept Beetle Bailey-like character who was part of the United States Army (Agrelot described him once as Torito Fuertes, all grown up)
*&quot;Cerebrito Ligón&quot;, a man who claimed to be a peeping Tom but wouldn&#x27;t dare to peep. A famous episode had a young Alida Arizmendi, later a Puerto Rican legislator, confronting him while he tried to sneak into an all-female gym;
*&quot;Speedy González&quot;, an extremely fast gibberish-talking handyman, who would always charge US$10.00 for his services (later increased to US$20.00 because of inflation). This character was a favorite of Benicio del Toro&#x27;s.
*&quot;Don Remigio Rodríguez y Rodriguez&quot;, an almost catatonic, extremely frank businessman (and the owner of &quot;Rodríguez y Rodriguez Sociedad en Comandita&quot;) who had a proclivity for face gestures and sticking out his tongue. He had a standing feud with Joaquín, the Spanish-born store owner across the street (played by Spanish actor Ricardo Fabregues), to whom he constantly insulted (&quot;¡Joaquín, pillo!&quot;) Don Rodríguez later starred in Sunshine Logroño&#x27;s film, &quot;Chona, La Puerca Asesina&quot;
*&quot;El Juez&quot;, a character modeled after Pigmeat Markham and Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Here Come Da Judge&quot; character (more Davis&#x27;s than Markham&#x27;s) who had a huge mallet and would use it against a defendant&#x27;s head if necessary during trials
*&quot;Don Segismundo&quot;, the mayor of Trujillo Bajo, a fictional municipality in Puerto Rico (Agrelot said once that Segismundo was actually Don Rodríguez y Rodríguez turned public servant)
*&quot;Pancho Matanzas&quot;, a Cuban immigrant that, as many did at the time, would sell anything to support himself and his family.
*&quot;Juan Macana&quot;, a not-very-bright police officer, PRPD badge number 13,378 who popularized in Puerto Rico a phrase Agrelot constantly heard in Mexico during one of his tours: &quot;Sí, ¿cómo no?&quot; (&quot;Yeah, why not?&quot;)

Agrelot would also parody famous characters from film and cinema in his comedy program, &quot;Ja Ja, Ji Ji, Jo Jo Con Agrelot&quot;. His most famous parody was that of Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone in The Godfather movie trilogy.

Agrelot appeared as Padre Ambrosio, a priest, in Jacobo Morales&#x27;s &quot;Dios Los Cria II&quot;. He also played a serious dramatic role in a television miniseries, &quot;Nadie lo va a saber&quot;, in 1991.

<text>Gonesse () is a commune in the Val-d&#x27;Oise department, in the north-eastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris.

The commune lies approximately eight kilometres (five miles) north of Le Bourget Airport, and it is six kilometres (four miles) south-west of Charles de Gaulle International Airport.

==History==

Since Carolingian times, cereals have been grown in Gonesse. In the period of the 12th through to the 16th centuries, the cultivation of grain was supplemented by drapery, in particular the production of the coarse woollen material of the &quot;gaunace&quot;. The commune was an important producer of wheat for the Parisian market in modern times, until the decline of its bakery trade at the end of the 18th century helped feed a strong migration to the capital.
The world&#x27;s first hydrogen filled balloon—the unmanned balloon launched by Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers from the Champ de Mars in Paris on 27 August 1783—flew for 45 minutes and landed in Gonesse, where the reportedly terrified local peasants destroyed it with pitchforks. This caused the government to issue a statement on the harmlessness and the scientific value of such experiments.

In 1815, Marshal Grouchy arrived in Gonesse in the course of the War of the Sixth Coalition, with 40,000 troops and 120 artillery pieces. On 2 July, the Duke of Wellington made his headquarters at the commune.

Since June 1939, the property Frapart (the &quot;Castle&quot;) is used as the main establishment of the urban administration.

Jean Camus, Louis Furmanek, Pierre Lorgnet, and Albert Drouhot from Gonesse belonged to the French Resistance movement during the German occupation of France from 1940 to 1944.

On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590—a Concorde supersonic transport—crashed onto a hotel in the town after a tyre blew out, caused by running over a strip of metal that had fallen off a DC-10 at nearby Charles de Gaulle International Airport. The crash led to the deaths of all 109 people on board and four more on the ground. The Concorde crash occurred fewer than 6 km from Goussainville, the site of the crash of the supersonic Tupolev Tu-144 during the 1973 Paris Air Show.

==Population==

== Sights ==

Among the places worthwhile to visit in the town are the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, the old Hotel-Dieu, the Hotel-Dieu, the lofts Garlande and Orgemont, and the estates of Malmaison and of Coulanges.

==Transport==
Gonesse is served neither by the Paris Métro, RER, nor the suburban rail network. The closest station is the Villiers-le-Bel–Gonesse–Arnouville station on the Paris RER D. This station is located in the neighbouring commune of Arnouville-lès-Gonesse, from Gonesse town centre.

==Education==
, the commune had 20 municipal primary schools with a total of 3,526; pupils, including 11 pre-schools (&quot;écoles maternelles&quot;) with a total of 1,389 pupils (in addition to 20 children in &quot;toute petite&quot; programmes) and nine elementary schools with 2,137 total pupils.

Junior high schools:
* College Philippe Auguste
* Collège Robert Doisneau
* Collège François Truffaut

There is one senior high school, Lycée René Cassin-Gonesse.

==Notable people==
*Philip Augustus, King of France born in Gonesse 21 August 1165.
*Simon Abkarian, French-Armenian actor
*Ernest Broquet, former mayor of Gonesse and recipient of the Legion of Honor
*Woyo Coulibaly, footballer
*Axel Disasi, footballer

<text>A demilitarized zone (DMZ or DZ) is an area in which treaties or agreements between states, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities, or personnel. A DZ often lies along an established frontier or boundary between two or more military powers or alliances. A DZ may sometimes form a &quot;de facto&quot; international border, such as the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Other examples of demilitarized zones are a wide area between Iraq and Kuwait; Antarctica (preserved for scientific exploration and study); and outer space (space more than from the Earth&#x27;s surface).

Some zones remain demilitarized after an agreement has awarded control to a state which (under the DZ terms) had originally ceded its right to maintain military forces in the disputed territory. It is also possible for powers to agree on the demilitarization of a zone without formally settling their respective territorial claims, enabling the dispute to be resolved by peaceful means such as diplomatic dialogue or an international court.

Several demilitarized zones have also unintentionally become wildlife preserves because their land is unsafe for construction or less exposed to human disturbances (including hunting). Examples include the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the Cypriot Demilitarized Zone (The Green Line), and the former Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone which divided Vietnam into two countries (North Vietnam and South Vietnam) from 21 July 1954 to 2 July 1976.

==Current demilitarized zones==
* Antarctica – The Antarctic Treaty forbids military activity in Antarctica, such as &quot;the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military manoeuvres, as well as the testing of any type of weapon&quot;. The Treaty does however provide for the &quot;use of military personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other peaceful purpose&quot;.
* Joint Control Commission – Known locally as the Dniester Valley Security Zone, the demilitarized buffer zone was created by the cease-fire agreement ending the War of Transnistria. The Commission&#x27;s peacekeeping mission monitors the demilitarized zone which roughly outlines the Dnister river between Moldova and Transnistria. It is 225 kilometers long and from 1 to 15 kilometers wide.
* Korean Demilitarized Zone – The Korean Armistice Agreement created a 4 km (2.5 mi)-wide demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea following the Korean War. It is currently one of the most heavily militarized areas in the world despite the name.
* Kuwait–Iraq barrier – The United Nations Security Council approved the creation of a demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait in Resolution 689 after the Persian Gulf War. Although the demilitarized zone is no longer mandated by the council, it continues to exist.
* Martín García Island – An Argentine island surrounded by Uruguayan waters of the Río de la Plata, according to the 45th article of the Río de la Plata Treaty it states that &quot;the Martín García Island will be destined exclusively as a natural reserve for the conservation and preservation of the native fauna and flora, under the jurisdiction of the Argentine Republic&quot;, stating a demilitarized zone in the island.
* Preah Vihear Temple – The International Court of Justice had ordered the creation of a &quot;provisional demilitarized zone&quot; around the Temple whose ownership is claimed by both Cambodia and Thailand.
* Sinai Peninsula – The Egypt–Israel peace treaty sets a limit to the amount of forces Egypt can place in the Sinai Peninsula. Parts of the peninsula are demilitarized to various degrees, especially within of Israel. Israel also agreed to limit its forces within of the Egyptian border. The areas are monitored by the Multinational Force and Observers. Because of the Sinai insurgency all sides agreed and encouraged Egypt to send large amounts of military forces into the area, including tanks and helicopters, to fight Islamist groups.
* Sudan – A demilitarized zone along the Sudan – South Sudan border.
* United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus – The United Nations Security Council created a buffer zone separating the self-proclaimed, internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus from the Republic of Cyprus. It was authorized by Resolution 186 and is patrolled by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.
* United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone – The United Nations Security Council approved the creation of a demilitarized zone in a portion of the Israeli-occupied territory of the Golan Heights in Syria in Resolution 350 after the Yom Kippur War. The zone is monitored by the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force.
* Åland – The Åland Convention of 1921, which was concluded following a decision of the League of Nations in response to the Åland crisis, mandates that the Finnish government maintain the territory as a demilitarized area.

==Former demilitarized zones==

* A neutral territory was established between the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and Spain after the end of the 1727 siege. A strip of land 600 toises (about ) long, more than two cannon shots&#x27; distance between the British and Spanish guns, was called &quot;the neutral ground&quot; and shown as such on older maps. In 1908, the British built a fence in a portion claimed to be the British half of the neutral territory. Spain does not recognize British sovereignty over the isthmus (including the border), asserting it is Spanish soil. Although both the United Kingdom and Spain used to be part of the European Union (before the United Kingdom&#x27;s exit), the border was a &quot;de facto&quot; international frontier with customs and immigration checks; Spain does not formally recognize it as a &quot;frontier&quot;, referring to it as a &quot;fence&quot;. Whatever its name, Gibraltar opted out of the European Union Customs Union and is not part of the Schengen Area; the border is open 24 hours a day, with customs duties payable on designated goods entering Spain or Gibraltar.
*Rhineland – The Treaty of Versailles designated the Rhineland as a demilitarized zone after World War I, prohibiting the Weimar Republic from deploying its military there. It was re-occupied and re-militarized in 1936 by Nazi Germany in violation of international treaties.
*Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone – The Uqair Protocol established a demilitarized zone between the Sultanate of Nejd and the Kingdom of Iraq, which at the time was a League of Nations mandate administered by the British Empire. Nejd was later incorporated into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The zone was partitioned in 1981 but the treaty was not filed with the United Nations. The zone was finally officially abolished during the Persian Gulf War, when Iraq and Saudi Arabia cancelled all international agreements with each other. 
*Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone – The Uqair Protocol established a neutral zone between the Sultanate of Nejd and the British protectorate of Kuwait in 1922. It was partitioned by mutual agreement in 1970.
*Israel and Egypt:
**Following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, a DMZ (the El Auja Zone) was created by the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Egypt.
*Israel and Jordan:
**The Israeli enclave and Jordanian area on Mt. Scopus was designated as a DMZ.
**The area around the Latrun salient.
*Israel and Syria: Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, three DMZs were created by the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Syria.
*China – The Imperial Japanese Army conquered Manchuria between September 1931 and February 1932, when they proclaimed the region the state of Manchukuo. In May 1933, the Tanggu Truce between China and Japan was concluded, establishing a demilitarized zone between Manchukuo and China. In 1937 Japan violated this truce with an invasion of the remainder of China. In 1945, after the fall of the Japanese empire at the end of the Asia-Pacific theater of World War II, Manchuria was re-incorporated into China.
*Ecuador – a demilitarized zone was established on 2 October 1941, after the war between Ecuador and Peru, which existed under Ecuadorian administration and under the observation of neutral mediator nations: the United States, Brazil and Argentina. The DMZ was abolished in 1942, with the withdrawal of Peruvian forces from El Oro Province after the signing of the Rio Protocol.
*Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone – The demilitarized zone between North Vietnam and South Vietnam was established in July 1954 as a result of the Geneva Conference ending the war between the Viet Minh and France. The DMZ in Vietnam officially lay at the 17th parallel and ended in 1976; in reality, it extended about on either side of the Bến Hải River and west to east from the Lao border to the South China Sea.
*Norway and Sweden established a demilitarized zone of 1 km (1,100 yards) on each side of their border after the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. The zone was abolished by mutual agreement in 1993.
*El Caguán DMZ – A demilitarized zone was established in southern Colombia between 1999 and 2002, during the failed peace process that involved the Government of President Andrés Pastrana and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
*Northern Syria Buffer Zone – A demilitarized zone in northern Syria straddling portions of the Syria–Turkey border. It was established between Turkey and the United States, both NATO allies, during the Syrian Civil War to prevent clashes between Kurdish and Turkish forces. The DMZ collapsed in October 2019, after Turkey dismissed the agreement and the United States ordered a withdrawal of US forces from northern Syria, allowing the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria to go ahead.
*Ground Safety Zone – A demilitarized area between Serbia and Kosovo was created under the Kumanovo Agreement following the Kosovo War that existed between 1999 and 2001. Following the Insurgency in the Preševo Valley, Serbian forces were allowed to enter GSZ. 
* Idlib demilitarization agreement zone – A demilitarized zone, created by agreement between Russian and Turkish government, splitting the last major stronghold of the Syrian rebels from the Syrian government controlled area amidst the Syrian Civil War.

<text>Stevan Robert Harnad (Hernád István Róbert, Hesslein István, born 1945) is a Canadian cognitive scientist based in Montreal.

==Early life and education==
Harnad was born in Budapest, Hungary. He did his undergraduate work at McGill University and his graduate work at Princeton University&#x27;s Department of Psychology. Harnad completed his Master of Arts degree in Psychology from McGill University in 1969 and received his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Princeton University in 1992. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by University of Liège in 2013.

== Research ==
Harnad&#x27;s research interests are in cognitive science, open access and animal sentience. He is currently professor of psychology at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), McGill University, and professor emeritus of cognitive science at the University of Southampton. Elected external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2001 (resigned in protest, 8 October 2016), he was Canada Research Chair in cognitive science 2001–2015. His research is on categorization, communication, cognition, and consciousness and he has written extensively on categorical perception, symbol grounding, origin of language, lateralization, the Turing test, distributed cognition, scientometrics, and consciousness. Harnad is a former student of Donald O. Hebb and Julian Jaynes.

== Research publishing and open access ==
In 1978, Harnad was the founder of &quot;Behavioral and Brain Sciences&quot;, of which he remained editor-in-chief until 2002. In addition, he founded &quot;Psycoloquy&quot; (an early electronic journal sponsored by the American Psychological Association), &quot;CogPrints&quot; (an electronic eprint archive in the cognitive sciences hosted by the University of Southampton), and the American Scientist Open Access Forum (since 1998; now the Global Open Access List, GOAL). Harnad, an active promoter of open access self-archiving and EPrints is currently Editor-in-Chief of the refereed journal &quot;Animal Sentience&quot;.

=== Scholarly skywriting ===
Scholarly skywriting, coined by Harnad around 1987, is the combination of multiple email and a topic threaded web archive such as a newsgroup, electronic mailing list, hypermail, netnews or Internet forum, linked and sortable by date, author, or subject-heading threads. The name derives from the idea that texts can be written in the &quot;sky&quot; (via multiple email and a web archive) for all to see (&quot;skyreading&quot;) and all to add their own comments to (&quot;skywriting&quot;). Harnad suggested that it could be a kind of open peer review, a supplement to classical peer review, but not a substitute for it. What Harnad called student skywriting is scholarly skywriting done in a teaching/learning context.

== Political activism ==
Harnad is the author of a 2011 open letter signed by over 60 external members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences addressed to the Academy&#x27;s President, József Pálinkás, concerning the press and police harassment campaign against Hungarian philosophers who were critics of the current Hungarian ruling party, Fidesz, and its prime minister, Viktor Orbán. Harnad resigned from his external membership of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences on 8 October 2016 in protest against the increasingly &quot;Illiberal democracy&quot; of Viktor Orban.

== Animal welfare ==
Harnad is Editor-in-Chief of the refereed journal &quot;Animal Sentience&quot; launched in 2015 by the Institute of Science and Policy of The Humane Society of the United States. A vegan, Harnad is increasingly active in animal welfare, animal rights, and animal law.

<doc id="179431" wikidata="Q232323" url="?curid=179431" title="Berengaria of Castile">
<text>Berengaria (Castilian: &quot;Berenguela&quot;), nicknamed the Great (Castilian: la Grande) (1179 or 1180 – 8 November 1246), was Queen of Castile for a brief time in 1217, and Queen of León from 1197 to 1204 as the second wife of King Alfonso IX. As the eldest child and heiress presumptive of Alfonso VIII of Castile, she was a sought-after bride, and was engaged to Conrad, the son of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I. After Conrad&#x27;s death, she married her cousin Alfonso IX of León to secure the peace between him and her father. She had five children with him before their marriage was voided by Pope Innocent III.

When her father died, Berengaria served as regent for her younger brother Henry I in Castile until she succeeded him on his untimely death. Within months, she turned Castile over to her son Ferdinand III, concerned that as a woman she would not be able to lead Castile&#x27;s forces. However, she remained one of his closest advisors, guiding policy, negotiating, and ruling on his behalf for the rest of her life. She was responsible for the re-unification of Castile and León under her son&#x27;s authority, and supported his efforts in the Reconquista. She was a patron of religious institutions and supported the writing of a history of the two countries.

==Early life==
Berengaria was born either in 1179 or 1180, in Burgos. She was the eldest daughter of King Alfonso VIII of Castile and his wife, Eleanor of England. She was the elder sister of Henry I of Castile and was named in honor of Alfonso VIII&#x27;s grandmother Berengaria of Barcelona. Those who cared for the young infanta were generously rewarded. Her nurse, Estefanía, received land from Alfonso and Eleanor on her retirement in May 1181. Another nurse, Elvira, received a similar retirement gift in 1189 at Berengaria&#x27;s request.

As the eldest child of King Alfonso and Queen Eleanor, who preferred to give birth to a son and therefore later king, Berengaria was the heiress presumptive to the throne of Castile for several years because many of the children born later to the couple died shortly after birth or in early infancy. She became a greatly-desired bride throughout Europe.

Berengaria&#x27;s first engagement was agreed in 1187 when her hand was sought by Conrad, the fifth child of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. The next year, the marriage contract was signed in Seligenstadt, including a dowry of 42000 Maravedí. Conrad then marched to Castile, where in Carrión the engagement was celebrated and Conrad was knighted making him a servant of his new lord, Alfonso. Berengaria&#x27;s claim to the throne was based in part on documentation in the treaty and marriage contract, which specified that she would inherit the kingdom after her father or any childless brothers who might come along. Conrad would only be allowed to co-rule as her spouse, and Castile would not become part of the Empire. Furthermore, he was not allowed to claim the throne for himself in case of Alfonso&#x27;s death, but was obliged to defend and protect the kingdom until Berengaria arrived. The treaty also documented traditional rights and obligations between the future sovereign and the nobility.

The marriage was not consummated because Berengaria was less than 10 years old. Conrad and Berengaria never saw each other again. By 1191, Berengaria requested an annulment of the engagement from the pope, influenced, no doubt, by third parties such as her grandmother Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was not interested in having a Hohenstaufen as a neighbor to her French fiefdoms. Those fears were neutralized when Conrad was assassinated in 1196.

==Queen consort of León==
In order to help secure peace between Castile and León and by becoming a mediator between her father and her husband, Berengaria married King Alfonso IX of León, her first cousin once removed, in Valladolid in 1197. As part of the marriage, and in accordance with Spanish customs of the time, she received direct control over a number of castles and lands within León. Most of these were along the border with Castile, and the nobles who ran them in her name were allowed to seek justice from either king in the event of being wronged by the other. In turn, these knights were charged with maintaining the peace along the border in the queen&#x27;s name.

Starting in 1198, Pope Innocent III objected to the marriage on the grounds of consanguinity and even threatened to excommunicate Alfonso, though the couple stayed together until 1204. They vehemently sought a dispensation in order to stay together, including offering large sums of money. The pope denied their request, but they succeeded in establishing the legitimacy of their children. The marriage was dissolved in 1204. Berengaria returned to her parents in Castile in May, where she dedicated herself to the care of her children. The eldest of them, Eleanor (1198/99-1202), had died; Constance (1200–1242), Ferdinand (1201–1252), Alfonso (1203–1272), and Berengaria (1204–1237) survived infancy.

==Between queenships==
Though she had left her role as queen of León, she retained authority over and taxing rights in many of the lands she had received there, including Salamanca and Castroverde, which she gave to her son Ferdinand in 1206. Some of the nobles who had served her as queen followed her back to the court in Castille. The peace which had prevailed since her marriage was lost, and there was war again between León and Castille, in part over her control of these lands. In 1205, 1207, and 1209, treaties were made again between the two countries, each expanding her control. In the treaties of 1207 and 1209, Berengaria and her son were given again significant properties along the border, including many key castles, including Villalpando. The treaty in 1207 is the first existing public document in the Castilian dialect.

In 1214, on the death of her father, Alfonso VIII, the Castilian crown passed to his only surviving son, Berengaria&#x27;s 10-year-old brother, Henry I. Their mother Eleanor assumed the regency, but died 24 days after her husband. Berengaria, now heir presumptive again, replaced her as regent. At this point internal strife began, instigated by the nobility, primarily the House of Lara. They forced Berengaria to cede regency and guardianship of her brother to Count Álvaro Núñez de Lara.

In 1216, an extraordinary parliamentary session was held in Valladolid, attended by such Castilian magnates as Lope Díaz II de Haro, Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón, Álvaro Díaz de Cameros, Alfonso Téllez de Meneses and others, who agreed, with the support of Berengaria, to make common cause against Álvaro Núñez de Lara. At the end of May the situation in Castile had grown perilous for Berengaria, so she decided to take refuge in the castle of Autillo de Campos, which was held by Gonzalo Rodríguez Girón (one of her allies) and sent her son Ferdinand to the court of his father. On 15 August 1216, an assembly of all the magnates of Castile was held to attempt to reach an accord that would prevent civil war, but disagreements led the families of Girón, Téllez de Meneses, and Haro to break definitively with Álvaro de Lara.

==Queen of Castile==

Circumstances changed suddenly when Henry died on 6 June 1217 after receiving a head wound from a tile which came loose while he was playing with other children at the palace of the bishop of Palencia. His guardian, Count Álvaro Núñez de Lara, tried to hide the fact, taking the king&#x27;s body to the castle of Tariego, although it was inevitable that the news would reach Berengaria.

The new sovereign was well aware of the danger her former husband posed to her reign; being her brother&#x27;s closest agnate, it was feared that he would claim the crown for himself. Therefore, she kept her brother&#x27;s death and her own accession secret from Alfonso. She wrote to Alfonso asking that Ferdinand be sent to visit her, and then abdicated in their son&#x27;s favour on 31 August. In part, she abdicated as she would be unable to be the military leader Castile needed its king to be in that time.

==Royal advisor==
Although she did not reign for long, Berengaria continued to be her son&#x27;s closest advisor, intervening in state policy, albeit in an indirect manner. Well into her son&#x27;s reign, contemporary authors wrote that she still wielded authority over him. One example was how she arranged the marriage of her son with princess Elisabeth of Hohenstaufen (known as &quot;Beatriz&quot; in Castile), daughter of Duke Philip of Swabia and granddaughter of two emperors: Frederick Barbarossa and Isaac II Angelos of Byzantium. The wedding took place on 30 November 1219 at Burgos. Another instance in which Berengaria&#x27;s mediation stood out developed in 1218 when the scheming Lara family, still headed by former regent Álvaro Núñez de Lara, conspired to have Alfonso IX, King of León and King Ferdinand&#x27;s father, invade Castile to seize his son&#x27;s throne. However, the capture of Count Lara facilitated the intervention of Berengaria, who got father and son to sign the Pact of Toro on 26 August 1218, putting an end to confrontations between Castile and León.

In 1222, Berengaria intervened anew in favor of her son, achieving the ratification of the Convention of Zafra, thereby making peace with the Laras by arranging the marriage of Mafalda, daughter and heiress of the Lord of Molina, Gonzalo Pérez de Lara, to her own son and King Ferdinand&#x27;s brother, Alfonso. In 1224 she arranged the marriage of her daughter Berengaria to John of Brienne, a maneuver which brought Ferdinand III closer to the throne of León, since John was the candidate Alfonso IX had in mind to marry his eldest daughter Sancha. By proceeding more quickly, Berengaria prevented the daughters of her former husband from marrying a man who could claim the throne of León.

Perhaps her most decisive intervention on Ferdinand&#x27;s behalf took place in 1230, when Alfonso IX died and designated as heirs to the throne his daughters Sancha and Dulce from his first marriage to Theresa of Portugal, superseding the rights of Ferdinand III. Berengaria met with the princesses&#x27; mother and succeeded in the ratification of the Treaty of Las Tercerías, by which they renounced the throne in favor of their half-brother in exchange for a substantial sum of money and other benefits. Thus were the thrones of León and Castile re-united in the person of Ferdinand III, which had been divided by Alfonso VII in 1157. She intervened again by arranging the second marriage of Ferdinand after the death of Elisabeth of Hohenstaufen. Although he already had plenty of children, Berengaria was concerned that the king&#x27;s virtue not be diminished with illicit relations. This time, she chose a French noblewoman, Joan of Dammartin, a candidate put forth by the king&#x27;s aunt and Berengaria&#x27;s sister Blanche, widow of King Louis VIII of France. Berengaria served again as regent, ruling while her son Ferdinand was in the south on his long campaigns of the Reconquista. She governed Castile and León with her characteristic skill, relieving him of the need to divide his attention during this time.

==Patronage and legacy==

She met with her son a final time in Pozuelo de Calatrava in 1245, afterwards returning to Toledo. She died on 8 November 1246 and was buried at Las Huelgas near Burgos.

Much like her mother, she was a strong patron of religious institutions. She worked with her mother to support the Abbey of Santa María la Real de Las Huelgas. As queen of León, she supported the Order of Santiago and supported the Basilica of San Isidoro, not only donating to it, but also exempting it from any taxes. She re-established the tradition of Leónese royal women supporting the Monastery of San Pedro de Eslonza, last performed by her great-grand aunt, Sancha Raimúndez.

She is portrayed as a wise and virtuous woman by the chroniclers of the time. She was also concerned with literature and history, charging Lucas de Tuy to compose a chronicle on the Kings of Castile and León to aid and instruct future rulers of the joint kingdom. She herself was discussed in the works of Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, whose work was sponsored by her son Ferdinand, and Juan of Osma, who was chancellor of Castile under Ferdinand.

==Commemoration==
The Spanish Navy screw frigate , in commission from 1857 to 1877, was named for Berengaria of Castile.

<doc id="179434" wikidata="Q1685535" url="?curid=179434" title="Jean-François Rewbell">
<text>Jean-François Reubell () or Rewbell (6 October 1747 – 24 November 1807) was a French lawyer, diplomat, and politician of the Revolution.

==The revolutionary==
Born at Colmar (now in the &quot;département&quot; of Haut-Rhin), he became president of the local order of lawyers, and in 1789 was elected as a deputy to the Estates-General by the Third Estate of the &quot;bailliage&quot; of Colmar-Schlestadt.

In the National Constituent Assembly his oratory, legal knowledge and austerity of life gave him much influence. A partisan of revolutionary reforms, Rewbell voted in favor of reforms such as the &quot;Civil Constitution of the Clergy&quot;, but opposed the recognition of citizenship rights for Alsatian Jews.

In July 1791, after the flight of Louis XVI, the constitutional king, Rewbell left the Jacobin Club and joined the &quot;Feuillants&quot;. During the session of the Legislative Assembly, after the Constituent Assembly was dissolved in September of that year, he exercised the functions of &quot;procureur syndic&quot;, and was subsequently secretary-general of the &quot;département&quot; of Haut-Rhin. He was elected to the Republic&#x27;s National Convention in 1792, and was its envoy to the Rhineland, advocating the union of the Electorate of the Palatinate and other territories with France. A zealous promoter of the Trial of Louis XVI, he was absent on mission at the time of the king&#x27;s condemnation. 

==Directorate and retirement==
He took part in the Thermidorian Reaction movement which led to the fall of Maximilien Robespierre, and became a member of the reorganised Committee of Public Safety and of the Committee of General Security. In early 1795, he assisted Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès in negotiating the surrender of the Batavian Republic to the French Republic. His moderation caused his election by seventeen &quot;départements&quot; to the Council of Five Hundred.

Appointed a member of the Directory in November 1795, he became its president in 1796; he then entered the Council of Ancients. In office, Rewbell dealt with the Royalist attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; (The 18 Fructidor), as well as the Conspiracy of the Equals; he engineered the annexation of the Rhineland and the southern Low Countries to the Republic, as well as the invasion of the Old Swiss Confederacy and the creation of the Helvetic Republic. He was retired by ballot in 1799, after being held responsible for the French defeats of that year in front of the Second Coalition.

After Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s coup of 18 Brumaire he retired from public life, and died at Colmar.

<text>Brumaire () was the second month in the French Republican calendar. The month was named after the French &#x27;fog&#x27;, which occurs frequently in France at that time of the year.

Brumaire was the second month of the autumn quarter (&quot;mois d&#x27;automne&quot;). It started between 22 October and 24 October, ending between 20 November and 22 November. It follows Vendémiaire and precedes Frimaire.

In political/historical usage, Brumaire can refer to the coup of 18 Brumaire in the year VIII (9 November 1799), by which General Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the government of the Directory to replace it with the Consulate, as referenced by Karl Marx in his pamphlet, &quot;The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte&quot;, in which Marx parallels Napoleon&#x27;s original coup with the later 1851 Coup of his nephew, Louis-Napoleon.

== Day name table ==

Like all FRC months Brumaire lasted 30 days and was divided into three 10-day weeks called &quot;décades&quot; (decades). Every day had the name of an agricultural plant, except the 5th (Quintidi) and 10th day (Decadi) of every decade, which had the name of a domestic animal (Quintidi) or an agricultural tool (Decadi).

<text>Helmut Newton (born Helmut Neustädter; 31 October 192023 January 2004) was a German-Australian photographer. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described him as a &quot;prolific, widely imitated fashion photographer whose provocative, erotically charged black-and-white photos were a mainstay of &quot;Vogue&quot; and other publications.&quot;

==Early life==
Newton was born in Berlin, the son of Klara &quot;Claire&quot; (née Marquis) and Max Neustädter, a button factory owner. His family was Jewish. Newton attended the Heinrich-von-Treitschke-Realgymnasium and the American School in Berlin. Interested in photography from the age of 12, when he purchased his first camera, he worked for the German photographer Yva (Elsie Neuländer Simon) from 1936.
The increasingly oppressive restrictions placed on Jews under the Nuremberg laws, meant that his father lost control of the factory in which he manufactured buttons and buckles. He was briefly interned in a concentration camp on Kristallnacht, 9 November 1938, which finally compelled the family to leave Germany. Newton&#x27;s parents fled to Argentina. Newton was issued with a passport just after turning 18 and left Germany on 5 December 1938. At Trieste, he boarded the &quot;Conte Rosso&quot;, along with about 200 others escaping the Nazis, intending to journey to China. After arriving in Singapore, Newton found he was able to remain there, first briefly as a photographer for the &quot;Straits Times&quot; and then as a portrait photographer.

==From 1940: Life in Australia==
Newton was interned by British authorities while in Singapore and was sent to Australia on board the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, arriving in Sydney on 27 September 1940. Internees were taken to a camp at Tatura by train under armed guard. Newton was released from internment in 1942 and briefly worked as a fruit picker in Northern Victoria. In August 1942, he enlisted with the Australian Army and worked as a truck driver. After the war in 1945, he became a British subject, and changed his name to Newton in 1946.
 
In 1948, he married actress June Browne, who performed under the stage name June Brunell. Later, she became a successful photographer, under the ironic pseudonym Alice Springs, after Alice Springs, the town in Central Australia.
In 1946, Newton set up a studio in fashionable Flinders Lane in Melbourne and worked on fashion, theatre and industrial photography in the affluent post-war years. In May 1953, he shared his first exhibition with Wolfgang Sievers, a German refugee like himself, who had also served in the same company. The exhibition, &quot;New Visions in Photography&quot;, was displayed at the Federal Hotel in Collins Street and was probably the first presentation of New Objectivity photography in Australia. Newton went into partnership with Henry Talbot, a fellow German Jew, who had also been interned at Tatura, and his association with the studio continued even after 1957, when Newton left Australia for London. The studio was renamed Helmut Newton and Henry Talbot.

==Late 1950s: to London, Europe, a return to Australia==
Newton&#x27;s growing reputation as a fashion photographer was rewarded when he secured a commission to illustrate fashions in a special Australian supplement for &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, published in January 1956. He won a 12-month contract with &quot;British Vogue&quot; and left for London in February 1957, leaving Talbot to manage the business. Newton left the magazine before the end of his contract and went to Paris, where he worked for French and German magazines. He returned to Melbourne in March 1959 to a contract for Australian &quot;Vogue&quot;.

==1961: to Paris==
Newton and his wife finally settled in Paris in 1961 and his work as a fashion photographer continued. His images appeared in magazines including the French edition of &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.
Newton established a particular style, marked by erotic, stylised images, often with sado-masochistic and fetishistic subtexts. A heart attack in 1970 reduced his output, but his wife&#x27;s encouragement led to his profile continuing to expand, especially with the 1980 studio-bound stark infinity of the &quot;Big Nudes&quot; series. His &quot;Naked and Dressed&quot; portfolio followed and, in 1992, &quot;Domestic Nudes&quot;, which marked the pinnacle of his erotic-urban style. The series were underpinned with the prowess of his technical skills. Newton also worked in portraiture and more fantastical studies.
Newton shot a number of pictorials for &quot;Playboy&quot;, including Nastassja Kinski and Kristine DeBell. Original prints of the photographs from his August 1976 pictorial of DeBell, &quot;200 Motels, or How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot;, were sold at auctions of &quot;Playboy&quot; archives by Bonhams in 2002 for $21,075, and by Christie&#x27;s in December 2003 for $26,290.
==&quot;Three Boys from Pasadena&quot;==
In 2009, June Browne conceptualised a tribute exhibition to Newton, featuring three photographers who had befriended Newton in Los Angeles in 1980: Mark Arbeit, Just Loomis, and George Holz. All three had been photography students at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. All three became friends with Helmut and June Newton and, to varying degrees, assisted Helmut Newton. Each went on to independent careers. The exhibition premiered at the Helmut Newton Foundation in Berlin and combined the work of all three with personal snapshots, contact sheets, and letters from their time with Newton.
==Polaroids==
From the 1970s, Newton regularly used Polaroid instant cameras and film to get an immediate visualisation of composition and lighting, especially for his fashion photography. By his own admission, for the shoot of the &quot;Naked and Dressed&quot; series that started in 1981 for the Italian and French Vogue, he used Polaroid film “by the crate”. The Polaroids also served as a sketchbook, in which he scribbled notes with regard to the model, client, location and date. In 1992, Newton published Pola Woman, a book consisting only of his Polaroids. Over 300 works based on the original Polaroids were shown at 2011 exhibition, “Helmut Newton Polaroids”, at the Museum für Fotografie in Berlin.

==Death==

In later life, Newton lived in both Monte Carlo and Los Angeles, California, where he spent winters at the Chateau Marmont, which he had done every year since 1957. On 23 January 2004, he suffered a serious heart attack while driving down Marmont Lane from the Chateau Marmont to Sunset Boulevard. He was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center but doctors were unable to save him, and he was pronounced dead. His ashes are buried at the Städtischer Friedhof III in Berlin.

<doc id="179439" wikidata="Q371759" url="?curid=179439" title="London congestion charge">
<text>The London congestion charge is a fee charged on most cars and motor vehicles being driven within the Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ) in Central London between 7:00am and 6:00pm Monday to Friday, and between 12:00noon and 6:00pm Saturday and Sunday.

Inspired by Singapore&#x27;s Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system after London officials had travelled to the country, the charge was first introduced on 17 February 2003. The London charge zone is one of the largest congestion charge zones in the world, despite the removal of the Western Extension which operated between February 2007 and January 2011. The charge not only helps to reduce high traffic flow in the city streets, but also reduces air and noise pollution in the central London area and raises investment funds for London&#x27;s transport system.

The standard charge is £15, Monday–Friday from 7:00am to 6:00pm, and 12:00noon to 6:00pm on Saturday and Sunday (and Bank Holidays), for each non-exempt vehicle driven within the zone, with a penalty of between £65 and £195 levied for non-payment. The congestion charge does not operate between Christmas Day (25 December) and New Years Day (1 January) inclusive. In July 2013 the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any vehicle that emits 75 g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 standards for air quality. On 8 April 2019, the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) was introduced, which applies 24/7 to vehicles which do not meet the emissions standards: Euro 4 standards for petrol vehicles, and Euro 6 or VI for diesel and large vehicles. In October 2021, the ULEZ was expanded to cover the Inner London area within the North and South Circular Roads, and in August 2023 to all of Greater London. The ULEZ replaced the T-charge (toxicity charge) which applied to vehicles below Euro 4 standard. Since 2021 the congestion charge exemption has applied only to pure electric vehicles and from 2025 there will be no discounts for electric vehicles.

Enforcement is primarily based on automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR). Transport for London (TfL) is responsible for the charge which has been operated by IBM since 2009. During the first ten years since the introduction of the scheme, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion up to the end of December 2013. From 2003 to 2013, about £1.2 billion has been invested in public transport, road and bridge improvement and walking and cycling schemes. Of these, a total of £960 million was invested on improvements to the bus network.

The congestion charging scheme possibly facilitated a 10% reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions, and an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012, though these changes cannot be causally attributed to the congestion charge. Despite these gains, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network in order to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. TfL concluded in 2006 that, while levels of congestion in central London are close to levels before the congestion charge was implemented, its effectiveness in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the congestion charging scheme, though later studies emphasise that causality has not been established.

== Present scheme ==

=== Boundary ===

The current congestion charge zone covers the area within the London Inner Ring Road which includes both the City of London, which is the main financial district, and also the West End, which is London&#x27;s primary commercial and entertainment centre. Although primarily a commercial area, there are also 136,000 residents, out of a total Greater London population of almost 9,000,000. There is little heavy industry within the zone.

Starting at the northernmost point and moving clockwise, the major roads defining the boundary are Pentonville Road, City Road, Old Street, Commercial Street, Mansell Street, Tower Bridge Road, New Kent Road, Elephant and Castle, Kennington Lane, Vauxhall Bridge Road, Park Lane, Edgware Road, Marylebone Road and Euston Road (other roads fill the small gaps between these roads). Signs were erected and symbols painted on the road to help drivers recognise the congestion charge area.

The Western Extension, introduced in February 2007 and removed on 4 January 2011, included areas surrounded by the following roads starting from the north-westernmost point: Scrubs Lane, Harrow Road, Westway (part of the A40), Park Lane, Vauxhall Bridge Road, Grosvenor Road, Chelsea Embankment, Earl&#x27;s Court Road and part of the West Cross Route (A3320), but the Westway itself was not part of the zone.

=== Charges ===
In January 2013, Transport for London opened a public consultation to increase the standard charge by 15% by mid 2014, from £10 per day to £11.50, if paid in advance or on the day. The increase was expected to generate an estimated £84 million of additional revenue by the end of 2017/18. The consultation process ran from January 2014 to March 2014. According to TfL, the objective of the increase was to recoup inflation over the past three years and ensure the charge remains an effective deterrent to making unnecessary journeys in central London.

On 15 May 2020, the Congestion Charge was re-implemented following a period of suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic. From 22 June 2020, it will temporarily run from 7:00am to 10:00pm seven days a week (as opposed to the previous 7:00am to 6:00pm on weekdays), and the daily charge will rise from £11.50 to £15 per day for a period of one year.

====Fees and penalties====

, the following penalty charges apply:

The standard fee is £15 per day if paid in advance, by midnight on the day of travel, or if registered with Fleet Auto Pay or CC Autopay, an automated payment system which records the number of charging days a vehicle travels within the charging zone each month and bills the customer debit or credit card each month, or £17.50 if paid by midnight the third day after travel. Failure to pay after the third day after travel results in the issuance of a Penalty Charge Notice for £160, reduced to £80 if paid within 14 days, but increased to £240 if unpaid after 28 days.

====Discounts and exemptions====
Refunds are available to people who pay monthly or annually in advance whose plans change; reimbursements are available to NHS patients assessed to be too ill to travel by public transport, NHS staff using vehicles on official business, and care home employees. Residents living within or very close to the zone are eligible for a 90% discount which is charged via CC Autopay.

The system gives 100% discounts to registered cars which emit 75 g/km or less of carbon dioxide and meet the Euro 5 emission standard, vehicles with nine or more seats, motor-tricycles, two-wheeled motorcycles (and sidecars), mopeds, accredited breakdown companies, and roadside recovery vehicles. All-electric vehicles (BEVs) and eligible plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) qualify for a 100% congestion charge discount. A plug-in electric drive vehicle qualifies if the vehicle is registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and has a fuel type of &quot;electric&quot;, or alternatively, if the vehicle is a &quot;plug-in hybrid&quot; and is on the government&#x27;s list of PHEVs eligible for the OLEV grant. , approved PHEVs include all extended-range vehicles such as the BMW i3 REx, and plug-in hybrids such as the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, BMW i8, Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV (passenger and van variants), Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, and Volkswagen Golf GTE.

Taxis and private hire vehicles (PHVs) were exempt from the charge but the PHV exemption ended in April 2019, except for PHVs which are wheelchair accessible vehicles.

====End of Greener Vehicle Discount====
In November 2012, TfL presented a proposal to end the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited mainly vehicles with small diesel engines, that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100 g/km of CO2. The proposal was approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013 and the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75 g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. , there are no internal combustion-only vehicles that meet these criteria. The measure was designed to curb the growing number of diesel vehicles on London&#x27;s roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before they have to pay the full congestion charge. Other changes were the removal of the option to pay the charge in shops, and the penalty charge was increased to £10. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016. In December 2018, a further tightening of the standards was announced, in part to bring standards beyond that of the ULEZ. This means that since April 2019 only vehicles which are Euro 6, emit up to 75 g/km of and have a minimum 20 mile zero emission range have qualified for the discount. A further phase from October 2021 will mean that only zero-emission vehicles (pure electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles) can qualify, and the discount will be phased out completely from December 2025.

==== T-Charge emissions surcharge ====
An emissions surcharge, known as the Toxicity Charge or T-Charge, was introduced on 23 October 2017. It operated for the same hours as the congestion charge (7:00am to 6:00pm on weekdays). Older cars and vans that did not meet Euro 4 standards had to pay an extra £10 charge on top of the congestion charge to drive in central London, within the Congestion Charge Zone (CCZ). The charge typically applied to diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006, and the levy affected up to 10,000 vehicles. The public consultation on the T-Charge proposals began in July 2016.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced the introduction of the scheme on 17 February 2017 after London achieved record air pollution levels in January 2017, and the city was put on a high pollution alert for the first time ever, as cold and stationary weather failed to clear toxic pollutants emitted mainly by diesel vehicles.

In December 2017, TfL said that the charge had cut the number of non-compliant vehicles by around 1,000 per day, with the remaining 2,000 paying the £10 charge (a further 3,000 vehicles are eligible for discounts due to Blue Badges etc.).

The T-Charge was replaced by the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) on 8 April 2019. For the ULEZ sunset period the T-Charge was still levied for uncompliant vehicles on holders of the residents&#x27; discount.

====Ultra Low Emission Zone====

The ULEZ went into effect in April 2019 and replaced the T-Charge. It initially covered the same area as the T-Charge and the Congestion Charge Zone but applies 24/7, every day of the year (except Christmas Day), with charges of £12.50 a day for cars, vans and motorcycles, and £100 a day for lorries, buses and coaches. The ULEZ caused a 20% reduction in emissions and resulted in a drop of non compliant vehicles entering the zone each day from 35,578 to 23,054. The zone was extended to the North Circular and South Circular roads in October 2021 and was extended to the whole of Greater London from 29 August 2023.

===Suspensions, avoidance and evasion===
TfL can and does suspend the congestion charge either in a small local area to cope with incidents and if directed to do so by a police officer. The congestion charge was suspended on 7 and 8 July 2005 in response to the terrorist attacks on London Transport. The congestion charge was also suspended on 2 February 2009, in response to an extreme weather event (heavy snowfall) in the London area.

Although avoidance has become more sophisticated, compliance with the scheme and terms of payment has improved over the last few years, as is evidenced by the income from penalties dropping by approximately a quarter between 2005 and 2007. However, even after charges were increased, enforcement charges still made up a significant proportion (42–48%) of total revenues.

The 2008 annual report on the operation of the scheme shows that around 26% of penalties go unpaid, because the notice is cancelled on appeal or the amount cannot be recovered, for example if the registered keeper of the vehicle cannot be traced, has died, or is bankrupt.

Several newspapers have reported about the use of copied number plates to avoid the congestion charge, resulting in vehicle owners receiving penalty notices for failure to pay when their vehicles have not been inside the zone. Numbers known to be copied are stored in a database and trigger alerts, including police vehicle ANPR camera alerts, when observed in use.

=== Payment by embassies ===
Following pressure from the Mayor of London, an increasing number of embassies accepted the charge and by 2008 a total of 99 out of 128 embassies had agreed to the charge. Among others, decliners include Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States, who, by 2015, collectively owed £95 million. The United States and Germany are reported to consider it to be a local tax, from which they are protected by the Vienna Convention, rather than a toll.

In May 2011, Johnson raised the issue with the President of the United States, Barack Obama, who was fined £120 after driving through London in the Presidential state car without paying the toll during a state visit to Buckingham Palace. The United States subsequently claimed diplomatic immunity. A TfL spokesperson noted that US embassies do pay tolls in Oslo and Singapore. In 2024 Transport for London estimated that, by the end of 2023, £143 million was owed by foreign embassies in London: since the charge was introduced in 2003, the US Embassy owed the most with £14.6 million, followed by Japan at £10 million, India with £8.5 million, and Nigeria with £8.4 million.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The government&#x27;s Smeed Report of 1964 was the first full assessment of the practicality of road pricing in a British city on the basis of congestion. It recommended a method of &quot;car user restraint&quot; by a variable system of charging for road usageif the government had the will to do so. During the early years of the Greater London Council, which was formed in 1965, the first plans were drawn up for a system of cordon charging or supplementary licensing for use in the central area. A formal study was undertaken into the merits of the scheme, and in 1973 concluded that it would improve traffic and environmental conditions in the centre. These plans were being developed at the same time as the London Ringways, a series of four orbital motorways around and within London including Ringway 1 (the London Motorway Box) leading to widespread public protest by Homes before Roads and others. Only a small section of these road schemes had been implemented by the time Labour gained control in the 1973 Greater London Council elections, and the new administration abandoned the road building plans in favour of public transport and traffic management. The new administration, to which Ken Livingstone had just been elected for the first time, studied a congestion scheme similar to the one which was eventually adopted the following year.

=== Planning and preparation ===
In 1995, the London Congestion Research Programme concluded that the city&#x27;s economy would benefit from a congestion charge scheme, the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 required local authorities to study and reduce traffic volumes and any future London mayors were given the power to introduce &quot;Road user charging&quot; by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. In his manifesto for the 2000 London Mayoral election, Ken Livingstone had proposed to introduce a £5 charge for vehicles entering central London.

Following his victory, the Mayor made a draft order and requested a report from TfL, which summarised the reasons for introducing the scheme. The scheme was to be introduced to reduce congestion in the centre of the capital following the &quot;Draft Transport Strategy&quot; of January 2001 which had highlighted the importance that the Mayor placed on tackling this issue. The charge was to be part of a series of measures to improve the transport system in London and was to combined with public transport improvements and increased enforcement of parking and traffic regulations. The report stated that the scheme was expected to be the most effective in reducing through traffic, reducing congestion both within and outside the zone, improving the speed of buses and the quality of life in central London. It was stated that improved traffic flows would make London more attractive to business investment. Substantial net revenues were anticipated, which were to be invested in London&#x27;s transport system. It also states that 90% of those who responded to a consultation on the scheme, viewed reducing traffic congestion in central London as &#x27;important&#x27;.

In July 2002, Westminster City Council launched a legal challenge against the plans, arguing that they would increase pollution and were a breach of human rights of residents on the boundary of the zone. The High Court rejected the claim. The London Ambulance Service (LAS) anticipated increased volumes of traffic around the edge of the zone and an increase in demand within the zone, that might both adversely affect clinical outcomes.

Before the charge&#x27;s introduction, there were fears of a very chaotic few days as people got used to the new situation. Indeed, Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London and key proponent of the charge, himself predicted a &quot;difficult few days&quot; and a &quot;bloody day&quot;.

On introduction, the scheme was the largest ever undertaken by a capital city.

=== Introduction (February 2003) ===
The charge was introduced on 17 February 2003 covering the approximate area of the London Inner Ring Road. Starting at the northernmost point and moving clockwise, the major roads defining the boundary were Pentonville Road, City Road, Old Street, Commercial Street, Mansell Street, Tower Bridge Road, New Kent Road, Elephant and Castle, Vauxhall Bridge Road, Park Lane, Edgware Road, Marylebone Road and Euston Road (other roads filled the small gaps between these roads). The zone therefore included the whole of the City of London, the financial district, and the West End, London&#x27;s primary commercial and entertainment centre.

On the launch date of the original zone, an extra 300 buses (out of a total of around 8,000) were introduced. Bus and London Underground managers reported that buses and tubes were a little, if at all, busier than normal.

Originally, Capita Group maintained the system under a five-year contract worth around £230m. Having been threatened with the termination of the contract by Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London, for poor performance, when the zone was subsequently extended, Capita was awarded an extension to the original contract up until February 2009 to cover the expanded zone. Capita employed sub-contractors including India-based Mastek, who were responsible for much of the Information Technology infrastructure. Due to the wide spread of sub-contractors around the world and due to varying data protection regulations in different countries, the scheme had prompted concerns about privacy.

=== Immediate impact ===
On the first day 190,000 vehicles moved into or within the zone during charging hours, a decrease of around 25% on normal traffic levels, partly due to it also being the half-term school holiday. A report from the Bow Group stated that historically, London congestion is at its worst during the morning rush hour, and that the early days of congestion charging had little impact on that critical time, the main effect occurring after 11:00am. Just over 100,000 motorists paid the charge personally, 15–20,000 were fleet vehicles paying under fleet arrangements, and it was believed around 10,000 liable motorists did not pay the due charge.

Initial suggestions that school holidays were responsible for part of the traffic drop during the first week of operation of the charge were confirmed when traffic rose again by 5% following the return to school at the beginning of the second week of the charge. Reports indicated that, over the first month or so of operation, traffic was consistently down at least 15% on pre-charge levels, with the second week seeing the reduction drop to 20%.

The AA Motoring Trust suggested that changes to the timing of traffic lights and the end of major road works had also impacted congestion.

The effect of the congestion charge zone on local businesses is a contested issue. The TfL estimates that the effect on business has been overall neutral. However the effect on business differs significantly between stores. Some shops and businesses are reported to be heavily affected by the charge, both in terms of lost sales due to reduced traffic and increased delivery costs, as recognised by the London Chamber of Commerce. In August 2003, the John Lewis Partnership, a large department store, announced that in the first six months of the charge&#x27;s operation, sales at their Oxford Street store fell by 7.3% whilst sales at other stores in the Greater London area but outside the Congestion Charge Zone rose by 1.7%. To partly compensate for the loss of revenue they extended opening hours and introduced regular Sunday opening for the first time. However London First&#x27;s own report indicated that business was broadly supportive. Subsequently, another report stated that there had been a reduction in some employment in the charging zone. TfL criticised the reports as unrepresentative and that its own statistics reported no effect on business.

After the introduction of the charge, there were a number of suggestions for its future. Soon after charging commenced, Livingstone announced that he would carry out a formal review of the charge&#x27;s success or failure six months after its introductionbrought forward from one year, following the smooth start. On 25 February 2003 Livingstone stated, &quot;I can&#x27;t conceive of any circumstances in the foreseeable future where we would want to change the charge, although perhaps ten years down the line it may be necessary&quot; referring to the amount that drivers have to pay, indicating that £5 was sufficient to bring about the reduction in traffic that he had hoped for.

The London Assembly Budget Committee 2003 report on the company criticised the contract with Capita as not providing value for money. It was reported in July 2003 that TfL agreed to subsidise Capita by paying it £31 million because it was making no profits from the project, and that the most critical problem was the 103,000 outstanding penalty notices not paid.

On 23 October 2003 TfL published a report reviewing the first six months of the charge. The report&#x27;s main findings were that the average number of cars and delivery vehicles entering the central zone was 60,000 fewer than the previous year. Around 50–60% of this reduction was attributed to transfers to public transport, 20–30% to journeys avoiding the zone, 15–25% switching to car share, and the remainder to reduced number of journeys, more travelling outside the hours of operation, and increased use of motorbikes and bicycles. Journey times were found to have been reduced by 14%. Variation in journey time for a particular route repeated on many occasions also decreased. The report also claimed that although the charge was responsible for about 4,000 fewer people visiting the zone daily, that the charge was responsible for only a small fraction of the 7% drop in retail sales reported.
The report also stated that around 100,000 penalty fines were issued each month, of which about 2,000 were contested. By comparison, the initial seven-month trial in 2006 of the Stockholm congestion tax in the Swedish capital saw an average 25% reduction in traffic numbers.

In November 2003, &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine listed Ken Livingstone as one of the top 50 visionaries building a better world and who were considered to have contributed most to science and technology during the year. They praised the mayor for his &quot;guts and leadership&quot; in introducing the charge which had reduced traffic and his &quot;courage&quot; in combating a classic case of externality, i.e. &quot;the exploitation of common resources by some people at the expense of others&quot;. They noted that other cities were now considering similar projects.

=== 2004 election campaign ===
In February, shortly before the June 2004 mayoral election TfL issued a consultation document on the expansion of the zone to the west that would cover the rest (western portion) of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The proposed extension was to cover around 230,000 residents, compared with the 150,000 in the original zone.

Steven Norris, the Conservative Party candidate for mayor in 2004, has been a fierce critic of the charge, branding it the &quot;Kengestion charge&quot; (a blend of &quot;Ken&quot; Livingstone and Con&quot;gestion&quot;). A few days before the scheme came into operation, he wrote in a BBC report that it had been &quot;shambolically organised&quot;, that the public transport network had insufficient spare capacity to cater for travellers deterred from using their cars in the area by the charge. Further, he said that the scheme would affect poorer sections of society more than the rich, with the daily charge being the same for all, regardless of vehicle size. He pledged to scrap it if he became mayor in June 2004 and said he would grant an amnesty to anyone with an outstanding fine for non-payment of the charge.

The Liberal Democrat candidate, Simon Hughes, however, supported the basic principles of the scheme. Amongst some of the changes he proposed were changing the end time from 6:30pm to 5:00pm and automatically giving all vehicles five free days each year so as not to affect occasional visitors.

=== Preparing for the Western Extension ===
In August 2004, following Livingstone&#x27;s re-election, the results of the consultation on the Western Extension were published which showed that a substantial majority of respondents did not want the extension; however, Livingstone said he was going ahead and that the polls were a &quot;charade&quot; which did not diminish his electoral mandate. &quot;A consultation is not a referendum&quot; he said. Protests continued against the extension, with residents arguing that only 5% of the road space in the selected area was congested. Following on in May 2005 a further TfL consultation began with specific proposals about the extensions. These included a plan to reduce the operating hours of the charge by half-an-hour to &quot;boost trade at London&#x27;s theatres, restaurants and cinemas&quot;.

In October 2004, TfL stated that only seven of the 13 government aims for London transport would be met by 2010. The target on reducing congestion for Greater London overall will not be met, the report said.

By November 2004, Livingstone directly contradicted his belief that the charge would not be raised, saying: &quot;I have always said that during this term [his second term in office] it will go up to at least £6.&quot; By the end of the month, Livingstone announced that, in fact, the rise would be to £8 for private vehicles and £7 for commercial traffic. Business groups such as London First said following the announcement that the charges were &quot;totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable&quot;. The rise to £8 was announced formally on 1 April 2005, along with discounts for drivers buying month or year-long tickets. On 10 May 2006, in a live TV debate, Livingstone supported a rise in the charge to £10 by 2008.

A report in May 2005 stated that the number of shoppers had declined by 7% year-on-year in March, 8% in April and 11% in the first two weeks of May. TfL countered that an economic downturn, the SARS outbreak and threat of terrorism were likely factors. At the same time, a London Chamber of Commerce report indicated that 25% of businesses were planning on relocation following the charge&#x27;s introduction. However, an independent report six months after the charge was implemented suggested that businesses were then supporting the charge. London First commissioned the study which reported that 49% of businesses felt the scheme was working and only 16% that it was failing. The Fourth Annual Review by TfL in 2004 indicated that business activity within the charge zone had been higher in both productivity and profitability and that the charge had a &quot;broadly neutral impact&quot; on the London-wide economy. The Fifth Annual Review continued to show the central congestion zone outperforming the wider London economy.

In May 2005, businessman Miguel Camacho set up fivepounds.co.uk (referring to the then-current pricing), whose sole function was to sign up private drivers to their &quot;fleet&quot;, thus offering the convenience of not having to pay the charge pro-actively, avoiding fines in the case of a forgotten journey and also potentially getting a &quot;free journey&quot; if undetected by the cameras. TfL moved quickly to quash the loophole, by demanding that fleet operators provide the registration document for each vehicle in their fleet. Fivepounds went out of business on 26 February 2006.

The June 2005 increase in charges by 60% only resulted in a relatively small rise in revenues, as there were fewer penalty payments. The anticipated start-up costs of the Western extension were £125 million with operating costs of £33 million; expected gross revenues were expected to be £80 million, resulting in net revenues of £50 million.

In 2005, the Liberal Democrats claimed that Capita had been fined £4.5 million for missing the targets set for the congestion charge, that was equivalent to £7,400 for every day that the charge had existed.

At the end of September 2005, London Mayor Ken Livingstone confirmed the western expansion of the congestion charge, which came into effect on 19 February 2007. It was expected that the extension would increase congestion in the zone by around 5% as the 60,000 residents in the new zone will be entitled to the discounts available. Several roads were also to be left charge-free between the original zone and the extension.

In 2005, &quot;The Guardian&quot; obtained documentation under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 which showed that out of 65,534 penalty tickets issued to non UK-registered vehicles, only 1,993 had been paid.

TfL ran a six-month trial of &quot;tag and beacon&quot; (transponder) from February 2006 to replace the camera-based system. This uses an electronic card affixed to the windscreen of a vehicle and can be used to produce &quot;smart tolls&quot; where charges can be varied dependent on time and direction of travel. This system automatically deducts the charge so that the 50,000 drivers a year who forget to pay the fine would not be penalised. TfL has suggested that this scheme could be introduced from 2009.

Shortly before it was introduced, the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) predicted that the West London extension would cause 6,000 job losses. This was later contested by the Greater London Authority economist unit in a report, arguing the CEBR results were &quot;unfounded&quot;.

=== Introduction of the Western Extension ===
The boundary of the zone, as of 19 February 2007, started at the northern end of Vauxhall Bridge and (travelling in a clockwise direction) heads along the northern bank of the River Thames as Grosvenor Road, the Chelsea Embankment and Cheyne Walk. From there, it heads north, along the eastern edges of the Kensington and Earl&#x27;s Court one-way systems, part of the A3220, with the roads in between charged, before continuing to the A40 Westway as the Holland Road and the West Cross Route. The boundary then includes parts of North Kensington, but the actual boundary is defined by the West London Line railway track, which runs between Latimer Road (inside the zone) and Wood Lane (outside the zone), until Scrubs Lane, before turning east, following the Great Western Main Line out of Paddington towards Ladbroke Grove. Here, the boundary followed the Grand Union Canal and rejoined the existing zone at Edgware Road after skirting Paddington, by way of the Bishop&#x27;s Bridge Road, Eastbourne Terrace, Praed Street and Sussex Gardens.

The Western Extension was officially removed from the charging zone beginning 4 January 2011, with charging on the Western extension effectively ended on 24 December 2010 and enacted during the week of Christmas to New Year holiday period.

TfL provided some free through routes, where drivers do not have to pay the charge. The main route was defined by the western boundary of the original zone Vauxhall Bridge Road, Grosvenor Place, Park Lane and Edgware Road, with some additions around Victoria. To the north, the through route is the Marylebone Road, Euston Road and Pentonville Road. The Westway flyover at the eastern end is the other exempt route even though it cuts across the north-west corner of the zone.

In May 2007, a survey of 150 local businesses stated they had seen an average drop in business of 25% following the introduction of the charge. TfL disputed the findings, stating that there had been &quot;no overall effect&quot; on business and that it had outperformed the rest of the UK in the central zone during 2006.

In 2007 a green motoring website alleged to TfL that owners of luxury cars were registering their vehicles as minicabs to qualify for exemption from the charge. Registering a vehicle as a minicab costs £82 plus £27 per year licence fee, much less than the congestion charge. TfL responded that it carried out regular checks to confirm that cars were being used for the purposes they were registered for, and that they had not discovered any such cases.

Transport for London consulted on a charge for the Blackwall Tunnel in east London, but these proposals were suspended in November 2007 following significant opposition from the public. Former Mayor Ken Livingstone has stated that he had &quot;absolutely no plans to set up a congestion charging zone to charge vehicles that use the Blackwall Tunnel or the Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road. But if Greenwich wishes to do so on any of its roads then I will support them&quot;.

=== Proposed CO2 emissions based charging ===

In 2006 mayor Ken Livingstone proposed variable charges based on CO2 emission rate Vehicle Excise Duty bands. Charges would be reduced or eliminated for &quot;Band A&quot; vehicles, but would be increase it to up to £25 a day for the most polluting &quot;Band G&quot; vehicles. Consultation on these proposals began in August 2007 and ended on 19 October 2007. On 12 February 2008 TfL announced that they would introduce a new charging structure for vehicles entering the congestion zone, based on potential CO2 emission rates on 27 October 2008 following the imminent mayoral elections. The main change would be the introduction of two new fees:
* £25 per day (with no residents&#x27; discount) for &quot;cars&quot; which, if first registered on or after 1 March 2001 are rated in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) &quot;Band G&quot; (emitting above 225g/km of CO2), or if first registered before 1 March 2001 have an engine capacity of greater than 3000 cc and for &quot;pickups&quot; with two rows of seats which either are rated as emitting above 225g/km of CO2 or which have an engine capacity of greater than 3000 cc. In Alistair Darling&#x27;s 2008 budget it was announced that VED Band G would be lowered to 151g/km of CO2. TfL had not clarified whether the £25 daily charge would be linked to the band until the point became moot as the scheme was cancelled.
* £0 per day (a 100% discount) for cars that either are rated as emitting less than 100g/km CO2 and which meet the Euro 5 air pollution emissions standard or which are rated as emitting no more than 120g/km CO2 and which appear on the PowerShift register.

According to a report commissioned by Land Rover, the scheme would increase traffic delays and air pollution. Porsche announced they intended to request a judicial review, claiming that the new charges were disproportionate and would make no &quot;meaningful difference&quot; to the environment. Acting director of the RAC Sheila Raingner commented that &quot;The congestion charge was originally developed to reduce congestion and that the changes would confuse the public and reduce support and trust for future initiatives.&quot;

At the request of Porsche, King&#x27;s College released the full report of the possible effects of the new system that was originally commissioned by Transport for London which indicated that the proposed new system would reduce CO2 emissions in central London by 2,200 tonnes by 2012, but would increase CO2 emissions by 182,000 tonnes in outer London, due to drivers of more polluting vehicles avoiding congestion charge zones. A spokesman Transport for London stated that the methodology used by King&#x27;s was &quot;less robust and accurate than TfL&#x27;s methodology&quot; and that their findings suggested reductions of up to 5,000 tonnes of CO2 by 2009. They claimed that King&#x27;s College agreed with these results and were making revisions to their report.

=== 2008 mayoral election ===
The congestion charge remained an issue during the run up to the 2008 mayoral election. Boris Johnson, the Conservative Party candidate said he would look at a graduated charging scheme, would consult on whether to reduce the size of the charging zone and would not introduce the proposed emissions based charging system. Brian Paddick, the Liberal Democrat candidate, suggested exempting delivery vehicles from the charge. Johnson was elected and immediately announced that the emissions based charges would not be implemented.

===Johnson administration===
Following his election, Johnson announced that the CO2 emissions based charging would not go ahead, saying &quot;I am delighted that we have been able to scrap the £25 charge, which would have hit families and small businesses hardest. I believe the proposal would actually have made congestion worse by allowing thousands of small cars in for free&quot;. Porsche announced that they had been successful in the high court and had been awarded their legal costs which would run to &quot;a six-figure sum&quot;. Their managing director said: &quot;The charge was clearly unfair and was actually going to increase emissions in London... Porsche is proud to have played a decisive role in striking down such a blatantly political tax increase targeting motorists.&quot;

Johnson also announced that he would review the Western Extension following a public consultation planned for September 2008. Having held this consultation with residents he announced that the extension would be removed by 2010. Out of 28,000 people who responded to the consultation, 67% of the respondents, including 86% of businesses, said they wanted the extended zone removed.

On 20 October 2010, TfL announced that Western Extension would formally be removed on 4 January 2011, noting that charging on the Western Extension would in practice end on 24 December 2010 at the start of the Christmas break. Other changes implemented on 4 January 2011 included an increase of the charge to £10 if paid in advance or on the day and to £12 if paid by midnight the charging day after travel, with a reduced charge of £9 for people who sign up to CC Autopay (with a £10 registration fee) which allowed users to nominate up to five vehicles with all fees being automatically debited from a nominated bank account at the end of each month.

In the lead-up to the 2012 London mayoral election Johnson announced that he would give the Metropolitan Police access to cameras used to monitor vehicles travelling in the London congestion charge zone and the region-wide low emission zone, to help detect crime and would ensure that automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) was used &quot;across all London&quot; to help track down the vehicles of criminals. Ken Livingstone said he would freeze the congestion charge for 4 years. The election was won by Johnson.

=== 2020 ===
In 2020, the congestion charge was suspended from 23 March to 18 May in order to facilitate travel around the city for critical workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. NHS and care workers are exempt from the charge.

The congestion charge became controversial again with the proposed expansion of the charge to the Greater London area. Critics cite the charge&#x27;s failure to reduce congestion, and see the charge as a tax on those living close to London.

On the 22 June 2020 temporary measures were introduced under the terms of Transport for London&#x27;s £1.6bn rescue package from the government resulting in charge rises to £15 a day and being extended from 5 to 7 days a week.

== Effects ==
A number of studies have been made of its effects on congestion, traffic levels, road safety, the use of public transport, the environment, and business activity matters. 

One such study concluded that these effects cannot be causally attributed to the congestion charge, as the trends in these factors began before the introduction of the congestion charge, and continued largely unchanged after the introduction of the charge.

=== Traffic changes ===

====Traffic volume====

A year before the congestion zone, TfL set up automatic traffic counters and augmented them with regular classified traffic counts at key locations, to monitor flows.

TfL&#x27;s report in June 2007 found that the number of chargeable vehicles entering the zone had reduced by 30% (primarily cars and minicabs, although vans and lorries had decreased by 13%), while there were overall increases in the numbers of taxis, buses, and especially bicycles. The daily profile of traffic flows had changed, with less traffic after 9:30 am and a peak immediately before and after the end of the charging period. The level of traffic entering the zone during the morning peak had not reduced as much as at other times. The overall level of traffic of all vehicle types entering the central Congestion Charge Zone was consistently 16% lower in 2006 than the pre-charge levels in 2002. Year on year, counts of inbound traffic approaching the zone had also seen a distinct and significant 5–7% decline in the number of chargeable vehicles, which was unexplained. They had noted a small but pervasive long-term trend of less traffic entering the zone, expected to be a result of people changing their location and lifestyle, perhaps influenced by the charge. The conservative Bow Group noted that the main effect occurred after 11 am.

Once within the charging zone car and delivery traffic remained unchanged, suggesting that the journeys made by residents and businesses within the zone were broadly unaffected. Changes to the road network over the years has made direct comparisons difficult, but TfL suspect that certain routes used heavily by taxis and buses within the zone have seen substantially increased traffic. On some of the boundary roads traffic numbers had increased slightly but congestion and delays were largely unchanged from 2002 levels.

Following the introduction of the Western Extension, TfL stated that traffic had fallen around 10 to 15% in the extended zone. The original zone showed a 4% increase in congestion, following expansion of the congestion charging area and the introduction of discounts extended to residents of the new zone and buffer zone. TfL assessed the increase in charges in 2005 to have had only a slight impact overall.

In February 2013, ten years after the scheme introduction, TfL reported a 10% reduction in traffic levels from baseline conditions. TfL assessed that the scheme has had a significant impact in shifting people away from using cars, contributing to an overall reduction of 11% in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012.

A 2024 study found that the congestion charge reduced traffic in downtown London, as well as on untolled suburban roads leading downtown. The study found that the charge had a progressive impact, as low-skill commuters in the suburbs benefitted from less traffic.

====Traffic speeds====
The charge operates for under one third of the hours in a year and covers around two-thirds of the central London traffic. In total 8% of traffic kilometres (miles) are affected by the scheme. TfL have extrapolated the trends in road speed in the congestion zone; they have suggested that speeds would have dropped from 17 km/h (10 mph) in 2003 to 11.5 km/h (7 mph) by 2006, had the scheme not been put in place.

A report by TfL in early 2007 indicated that there were 2.27 traffic delays per kilometre (3.65 per mile) in the original charging zone. This compared with a figure of 2.3 per kilometre (3.7 per mile) before the introduction of the congestion charge. After the scheme was introduced they had measured an improvement in journey times of 0.7 minutes per km (1.1 per mile), or 30%. This improvement had decreased to 22% in 2006, and during 2006 congestion levels had increased so that the improvement, compared to the year before the scheme, was just 7%. TfL explained this as a result of changes to road priorities within the zone, delays caused by new pedestrian and road user safety schemes, and, most particularly, a doubling of road works in the latter half of 2006. Utilities were encouraged to complete planned road works in the year preceding the congestion charge, so it would appear that the first year of measurement used for later comparisons would also have been affected by streetworks to some extent.

TfL reported in January 2014, that despite a reduction of traffic volume within London, traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade, particularly in central London. TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network to improve the urban environment, increase road safety and prioritise public transport, pedestrian and cycle traffic, as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006. This explains the lower levels of congestion reduction compared to the pre-charge baseline: 8% in 2006, compared to 30% in 2004. Since 2006 this trend towards slower traffic movement has ceased and traffic speeds have remained more stable, as evidenced by GPS satellite tracking data from 2006 to 2012. Indicators of excess delay or congestion also suggest a stable overall picture, with some improvements in the past two years. TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre-charging levels, the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme.

=== Air quality ===
The pre-commencement report from TfL noted that the scheme was not expected to significantly affect air quality, but that offering a discount to encourage the use of greener fuels would be a positive measure.

TfL reported that levels of nitrogen oxides (NOX), fell by 13.4% between 2002 and 2003, and carbon dioxide, as well as the levels of airborne particulates (PM10) within and alongside the Inner Ring Road boundary of the zone.

Since 2002, the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) produced by diesel exhaust has become a serious problem, with the London Air Quality Network of Imperial College reporting that the annual mean NO2 objective (of 40 μgm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006. Although no areas within the Congestion Charge Zone reported NO2 levels above an upper limit of 200 μgm-3 (105 ppb), some monitoring areas near the zone boundary experienced very long periods at such levels, notably the A23 near Brixton (3741 hours) and the Marylebone Road (849 hours).

In 2007, the &quot;Fifth Annual Monitoring Report&quot; by TfL stated that between 2003 and 2006, NOX emissions fell by 17%, PM10 by 24% and CO2 by 3%, with some being attributed to the effects of reduced levels of traffic flowing better, with the majority being as a result of improved vehicle technology. In total, the rate of fall in CO2 has been almost 20% as of 2007.

The 2007 TfL report makes it clear that only a one-off reduction of emissions could be expected from the introduction of the charge, whilst further reductions are unlikely to be as a result of the charge. It notes that lower vehicles emissions may not necessarily feed through into improvements in air quality as vehicle emissions are only one contributor to total emissions of a particular pollutant along industrial sources and that weather conditions play a significant role, and that pollutant concentrations were being affected by changes in the make up of the vehicle fleet. It also suggests that the rate of decline in certain pollutants is decreasing.

A 2011 independent study published by the Health Effects Institute (HEI), and led by a researcher from King&#x27;s College London, found that there is little evidence the congestion charge scheme has improved air quality. This research used modelling and also compared actual air pollutant measurements within the congestion charge zone with those of control sites located in Outer London. The investigators concluded that &quot;it is difficult to identify significant air quality improvements from a specific programespecially one targeted at a small area within a large cityagainst the backdrop of broader regional pollutant and weather changes.&quot; National trends had already shown a rapid decline of some other emissions during the late 1990s, notably carbon monoxide, and levels have been relatively stable since 2002 across London.

A 2020 study of London found that the London congestion charge led to reductions in pollution and reductions in driving, but it increased pollution from diesel taxis and buses (which are exempt from the charge).

=== Public transport ===
On the launch date of the original zone, an extra 300 buses (out of a total of around 8,000) were introduced. Bus route changes have been made to take advantage of the presumed higher traffic speeds and the greater demand for public transport; route 452 was introduced and three others (routes 31, 46 and 430) were extended. The frequency of buses on other routes through the zone extension were also increased.

In 2007 TfL reported that bus patronage in the central London area (not the same as the Congestion Charge Zone) had increased from under 90,000 pre-charge to stabilise at 116,000 journeys per day by 2007. It also reported that usage of the Underground has increased by 1% above pre-charge levels, having fallen substantially in 2003–2004. They could not attribute any change in National Rail patronage to the introduction of the central zone charge.

===Road safety===
TfL estimated that the charge has led to a small reduction in road traffic casualties against a background trend of improvement across London and across the rest of Great Britain over the period. Cars and motorcycles have seen the biggest reduction in accidents, whereas bicyclists have seen a slight increase, which may reflect their increased numbers.

Of the reduction from 2,598 personal injury crashes inside the zone in the year before the scheme to 1,629 by 2005 TfL estimated that some 40 and 70 injuries may have been avoided annually due to the introduction of the charging zone, with most of the remaining reduction attributed to other changes to the road network favouring its people-moving capacity.

== Operations and technology ==

Whilst TfL is responsible for the scheme, the operation is sub-contracted to a number of outside companies. Since 2009, IBM has been responsible for the day-to-day operation of the charging system, whilst Siemens Traffic Solutions provides and operates the physical enforcement infrastructure. Transport for London announced that from 2009 IBM would operate the charge, along with the London low emission zone under contract.

The scheme makes use of purpose-built automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, manufactured by PIPs Technology, to record vehicles entering and exiting the zone. Cameras can record number plates with a 90% accuracy rate through the technology. The majority of vehicles within the zone are captured on camera. The cameras take two still pictures in colour and black and white and use infrared technology to identify the number plates. The camera network and other roadside equipment is managed largely automatically by an installation system developed by Roke Manor Research Ltd, which delivers number plates to the billing system. These identified numbers are checked against the list of payers overnight by computer. In those cases when a number plate has not been recognised then they are checked manually. Those that have paid but have not been seen in the central zone are not refunded, and those that have not paid and are seen are fined. The registered keeper of such a vehicle is looked up in a database provided by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), based in Swansea.

== Income and costs ==
TfL&#x27;s annual report for 2017–18 shows that revenues from the congestion charge were £229.8m over the financial year, representing 4.3% of TfL&#x27;s annual revenues. A quarter of this was spent on the cost of running the toll system, at £57.7 million. Once other charges were deducted, the congestion charge brought in an annual operating net income of £155.9m for TfL. This income compares with TfL&#x27;s total revenue that year from bus and tube fares of £4.319 billion.

The initial operating revenues from the congestion charge did not reach the levels that were originally expected. Within six months of the start of the scheme, the reduction in traffic had been such that TfL were predicting a £65 million revenue shortfall.

By law, all surpluses raised must be reinvested into London&#x27;s transport infrastructure; at the start of the scheme it was anticipated that this would be around £200 million. According to a report issued in February 2007, the initial costs of setting up the scheme were £161.7 million, with an annual operating cost of about £115m anticipated. Total revenues over the first three-and-a-half years had been £677.4 million, with TfL reporting a surplus over operating costs of £189.7 million. The Bow Group, using TfL data, estimated that by 2007 the project had only returned a modest £10 million profit.

Although Parliament has limited the amount that authorities can borrow, for some time it had been speculated that the regular income obtained from the congestion charge and other revenues could be used to securitise a bond issue that finances other transport projects across London. TfL issued their first bond for £200 million in 2005, to be repaid at 5% interest over 30 years. TfL plans to borrow £3.1 billion more to fund a five-year transport programme across London, including works on London Underground and road safety schemes.



From the scheme&#x27;s introduction in 2003 until December 2013, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, of which, over £1.2 billion (46%) has been invested in transport, including £960 million on improvements to the bus network; £102 million on roads and bridges; £70 million on road safety; £51 million on local transport/borough plans; and £36 million on sustainable transport and the environment.

<doc id="179443" wikidata="Q106978" url="?curid=179443" title="List of cities and towns in Latvia">
<text>There are 10 cities (, &quot;state city&quot;, ) and 71 towns (, &quot;municipality town&quot;, ) in Latvia. 

By Latvian law, towns are settlements that are centers of culture and commerce with a well-developed architectural infrastructure and street grid, and have at least 2,000 residents. A settlement can still be designated a town if it has fewer residents, but fulfills all other requirements (or has been a historic town). 

To become a city, a town must typically have at least 25,000 residents. Additionally, cities should have a well-developed commercial district, transport, public utilities, social infrastructure, and be a significant center of culture. However, these requirements may be disregarded if there is sufficient population.

In 2020, an agreement was reached in Latvian parliament, Saeima, to rename the previous nine &quot;republic&quot; cities with the new title of &quot;state city&quot; (&quot;valstspilsēta&quot;). It was at this time that a tenth state city, Ogre (formerly a town), was added to the list.

The 7 largest state cities have their own local governance independent of any municipalities, whereas the smallest 3 (Jēkabpils, Ogre and Valmiera) belong to their wider corresponding municipalities.

<doc id="179444" wikidata="Q743079" url="?curid=179444" title="Leslie Charteris">
<text>Leslie Charteris (; born Leslie Charles Bowyer-Yin; 12 May 1907 – 15 April 1993), was a British-Chinese author of adventure fiction, as well as a screenwriter. He was best known for his many books chronicling the adventures of his hero Simon Templar, alias &quot;The Saint&quot;.

==Early life==
Charteris was born Leslie Charles Bowyer-Yin, in Singapore. His mother, Lydia Florence Bowyer, was English. His father, Dr S. C. Yin (Yin Suat Chuan, 1877–1958), was a Chinese physician who claimed to be able to trace his lineage back to the emperors of the Shang dynasty.

Leslie became interested in writing at an early age. At one point, he created his own magazine with articles, short stories, poems, editorials, serials, and even a comic strip. He attended Saint Andrew&#x27;s School, Singapore, and after moving to England, Rossall School in Fleetwood, Lancashire. His formal education continued at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he read law. However, he dropped out in his first year to focus on developing his burgeoning literary career.

In 1926, Leslie legally changed his surname to &quot;Charteris&quot;. In the BBC Radio 4 documentary &quot;Leslie Charteris – A Saintly Centennial&quot;, his daughter stated that he had selected the name from a telephone directory. This information is contradicted by other sources, however. William Ruehlmann (author of &quot;Saint with a Gun: The Unlawful American Private Eye&quot;, in an introduction to the 1988 edition of &quot;The Saint in New York&quot;, &quot;He acquired..., in 1928, the legal name of Charteris, after the roguish Col. Francis, gambler, duellist and founder of the Hellfire Club&quot; – however this confuses the rake Col. Francis Charteris with Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer, also a rake and founder of the Hellfire Club.

==Career==
Charteris wrote his first book during his first year at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Once it was accepted, he left the university and embarked on a new career, motivated by a desire to be unconventional and to become financially well off by doing what he liked to do. He continued to write British thriller stories while working at various jobs, from shipping out on a freighter to working as a barman in a country inn. He prospected for gold, dived for pearls, worked in a tin mine and on a rubber plantation, toured Britain with a carnival, and drove a bus.

===Origin of Simon Templar===

Charteris&#x27;s third novel, &quot;Meet the Tiger&quot; (1928), introduced his most famous creation, Simon Templar. However, in his 1980 introduction to a reprint by Charter Books, Charteris indicated he was dissatisfied with the work, suggesting its only value was as the start of the long-running Saint series. Occasionally, he chose to ignore the existence of &quot;Meet the Tiger&quot; altogether and claimed that the Saint series actually began with the second volume, &quot;Enter the Saint&quot; (1930); an example of this can be found in the introduction Charteris wrote to an early 1960s edition of &quot;Enter the Saint&quot; published by Fiction Publishing Company (an imprint of Doubleday).

Charteris wrote a few other books, including a novelization of his screenplay for the Deanna Durbin mystery-comedy &quot;Lady on a Train&quot;, and the English translation of &quot;Juan Belmonte: Killer of Bulls&quot; by Manuel Chaves Nogales. However, his lifework – at least in the literary world – consisted primarily of Simon Templar Saint adventures, which were presented in the novel, novella, and short-story formats over the next 35 years. From 1963 onward, other authors ghost-wrote the stories, while Charteris acted as an editor, approving stories and making revisions when needed.

===Move to the United States===
Charteris relocated to the United States in 1932, where he continued to publish short stories and also became a writer for Paramount Pictures, working on the George Raft film &quot;Midnight Club&quot;. Charteris also wrote scripts for Alex Raymond&#x27;s newspaper comic &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; in 1935 to 1936. One story was drawn by Raymond, and the other two by Raymond&#x27;s successor Charles Flanders.

However, Charteris was excluded from permanent residency in the United States because of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a law which prohibited immigration for persons of &quot;50% or greater&quot; Oriental blood. As a result, Charteris was continually forced to renew his six-month temporary visitor&#x27;s visa. Eventually, an act of Congress personally granted his daughter and him the right of permanent residence in the United States, with eligibility for naturalization, which he later completed in 1946.

===Other activities===
In 1936, Charteris was a passenger on the maiden voyage of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. In America, &quot;The Saint&quot; became a radio series starring Vincent Price. In the 1940s, Charteris, besides continuing to write &quot;The Saint&quot; stories, scripted the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; radio series featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. In 1941, Charteris appeared in a &quot;Life&quot; photographic adaptation of a short story of &quot;The Saint&quot;, with himself playing the Saint.

===The Saint on film===
Long-term success eluded Charteris&#x27; creation outside the literary arena until RKO produced an eight-film series between 1938 and 1943: 
&quot;The Saint in New York&quot; (1938) with Louis Hayward as The Saint;
&quot;The Saint Strikes Back&quot; (1939), 
&quot;The Saint in London&quot; (1939, filmed on location), 
&quot;The Saint&#x27;s Double Trouble&quot; (1940),
&quot;The Saint Takes Over&quot; (1940), and 
&quot;The Saint in Palm Springs&quot; (1941) all with George Sanders as The Saint. Another Briton, Hugh Sinclair, took over the role in &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (filmed by RKO&#x27;s British studio in 1941) and &quot;The Saint Meets the Tiger&quot; (again produced by RKO in 1941 but shelved until Republic Pictures released it in 1943).

A ninth film, &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Return&quot; (known as &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Girl Friday&quot; in the US) from 1953, with Louis Hayward returning as The Saint, is sometimes regarded as part of the RKO series. However, it was produced by British Hammer Film Productions, based on a special agreement between Hammer Films and Leslie Charteris, which gave Charteris a percentage in the film. RKO acted only as the film&#x27;s US distributor, six months after the UK release.

Both George Sanders and Leslie Charteris had complaints about the Saint pictures; Sanders because he disliked playing the same role again and again, and Charteris because of the liberties taken by the screenwriters. RKO dropped the Saint series and replaced it with &quot;The Falcon&quot;, another debonair amateur sleuth played by Sanders. Charteris saw this as a ploy to deprive him of his royalties and sued RKO. Sanders bailed out of the &quot;Falcon&quot; series after three films, and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway.

A film loosely based on the character simply titled &quot;The Saint&quot; was released in 1997 with Val Kilmer in the title role.

===The Saint on TV===
In 1962–1969 the British-produced television series &quot;The Saint&quot; went into production with Roger Moore in the Simon Templar role.

Many episodes of the TV series were based upon Charteris&#x27; short stories. Later, as original scripts were commissioned, Charteris permitted some of these scripts to be novelized and published as further adventures of the Saint in printed form (these later books, with titles such as &quot;The Saint on TV&quot; and &quot;The Saint and the Fiction Makers&quot;, carried Charteris&#x27; name as author, but were in fact written by others). Charteris lived to see a second British TV series, &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; starring Ian Ogilvy as Simon Templar, enjoy a well-received, if brief, run in the late 1970s (with Charteris himself making a cameo appearance in one episode) and, in the 1980s, a series of TV movies produced by an international co-production and starring Simon Dutton kept interest in &quot;The Saint&quot; alive. Also, an ill-fated attempt at a 1980s TV series was made in the United States, which resulted in only a pilot episode being produced and broadcast. He also produced the original theme tune for the series, as can be seen in the end credits.

==Later life==
The adventures of &quot;The Saint&quot; were chronicled in nearly 100 books (about 50 published in the UK and US, with others published in France). Charteris himself stepped away from writing the books after &quot;The Saint in the Sun&quot; (1963). The next year, &quot;Vendetta for the Saint&quot; was published and while it was credited to Charteris, it was actually written by science fiction writer Harry Harrison. Following &quot;Vendetta&quot; came a number of books adapting televised episodes, credited to Charteris, but written by others, although Charteris did collaborate on several Saint books in the 1970s. Charteris appears to have served in an editorial capacity for these later volumes. He also edited and contributed to &quot;The Saint Mystery Magazine&quot;, a digest-sized publication. The final book in the Saint series was &quot;Salvage for the Saint&quot;, published in 1983. Two additional books were published in 1997, a novelization of the film loosely based on the character, and an original novel published by &quot;The Saint Club&quot;, a fan club that Charteris himself founded in the 1930s. Both books were written by Burl Barer, who also wrote the definitive history on Charteris and &quot;The Saint&quot;.

Charteris spent 55 years – 1928 to 1983 – as either writer of or custodian of Simon Templar&#x27;s literary adventures, one of the longest uninterrupted spans of a single author in the history of mystery fiction, equalling that of Agatha Christie, who wrote her novels and stories featuring detective Hercule Poirot.

A comic book adaptation of &quot;The Saint&quot; was produced in Sweden from 1969 to 1991 with at least 170 stories produced. As part of the contract, all story ideas had to be approved by Charteris himself before the story was completed. Among the creators of these stories were writers Norman Worker and Donne Avenell; the latter also co-wrote the novels &quot;The Saint and the Templar Treasure&quot; and the novella collection &quot;Count on the Saint&quot;, while Worker contributed to the novella collection &quot;Catch the Saint&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Charteris also wrote a column on cuisine for an American magazine, and invented a wordless, pictorial sign language called Paleneo, which he wrote a book about. Charteris was one of the earliest members of Mensa.

Charteris married four times (see the Family section below for details). In 1952, Charteris married Hollywood actress Audrey Long (1922–2014); the couple eventually returned to England, where he spent his last years living in Surrey. Their address was Corfield, Ridgemead Road, Englefield Green. He died at Princess Margaret&#x27;s Hospital Windsor, Berkshire, on 15 April 1993, survived by his wife and daughter, Patricia Charteris Higgins. Audrey died at Egham, Surrey in September 2014, aged 92.

==Family==
He was married four times:
#(in 1931) to Pauline Schishkin (1911–1975), daughter of a Russian diplomat and mother of Charteris&#x27; only child, a daughter, born in 1932
#(in 1938) to Barbara Meyer (1907–1950), editor at &quot;The American Magazine&quot;
#(in 1943) to Elizabeth Bryant Borst (1909–2003), Boston society woman and night club singer
#(in 1952) to Audrey Long (1922–2014), film actress

Charteris was the brother of Rev Roy Bowyer-Yin.

<doc id="179445" wikidata="Q202628" url="?curid=179445" title="Oldham">
<text>Oldham is a town in Greater Manchester, England. It lies amongst the Pennines on elevated ground between the rivers Irk and Medlock, southeast of Rochdale, and northeast of Manchester. It is the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, which had a population of 237,110 in 2019.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, and with little early history to speak of, Oldham rose to prominence in the 19th century as an international centre of textile manufacture. It was a boomtown of the Industrial Revolution, and among the first ever industrialised towns, rapidly becoming &quot;one of the most important centres of cotton and textile industries in England.&quot; At its zenith, it was the most productive cotton spinning mill town in the world, producing more cotton than France and Germany combined. Oldham&#x27;s textile industry fell into decline in the mid-20th century; the town&#x27;s last mill closed in 1998.

The demise of textile processing in Oldham depressed and heavily affected the local economy. The town centre is the focus of a project that aims to transform Oldham into a centre for further education and the performing arts. It is, however, still distinguished architecturally by the surviving cotton mills and other buildings associated with that industry.

In the 2011 United Kingdom census Oldham Built-up area subdivision, as defined by the Office for National Statistics, had a population of 96,555 and an area of , giving a population density of , while the Borough of Oldham had a population of 224,897, an area of , and a population density of .

== History ==

=== Toponymy ===
The toponymy of Oldham seems to imply &quot;old village or place&quot; from &quot;Eald&quot; (Saxon) signifying oldness or antiquity, and &quot;Ham&quot; (Saxon) a house, farm or hamlet. Oldham is however known to be a derivative of &quot;Aldehulme&quot;, undoubtedly an Old Norse name. It is believed to be derived from the Old English &quot;ald&quot; combined with the Old Norse &quot;holmi&quot; or &quot;holmr&quot;, meaning &quot;promontory or outcrop&quot;, possibly describing the town&#x27;s hilltop position. It has alternatively been suggested that it may mean &quot;holm or hulme of a farmer named Alda&quot;. The name is understood to date from 865, during the period of the Danelaw. Cumbric &quot;alt&quot;, meaning &quot;steep height, cliff&quot;, has also been suggested for the first element.

=== Early history ===
The earliest known evidence of a human presence in what is now Oldham is attested by the discovery of Neolithic flint arrow-heads and workings found at Werneth and Besom Hill, implying habitation 7–10,000 years ago. Evidence of later Roman and Celtic activity is confirmed by an ancient Roman road and Bronze Age archaeological relics found at various sites within the town. Placenames of Celtic origin are still to be found in Oldham: Werneth derives from a Celtic personal name identical to the Gaulish &quot;vernetum&quot;, &quot;alder swamp&quot;, and Glodwick may be related to the modern Welsh &quot;clawdd&quot;, meaning &quot;dyke&quot; or &quot;ditch&quot;. Nearby Chadderton is also pre-Anglo-Saxon in origin, from the Old Welsh &quot;cadeir&quot;, itself deriving from the Latin &quot;cathedra&quot; meaning &quot;chair&quot;. Although Anglo-Saxons occupied territory around the area centuries earlier, Oldham as a permanent, named place of dwelling is believed to date from 865, when Danish invaders established a settlement called Aldehulme.

From its founding in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, Oldham is believed to have been little more than a scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked Manchester to York. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, Oldham does appear in legal documents from the Middle Ages, invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall. Richard de Oldham was recorded as lord of the manor of Werneth/Oldham (1354). His daughter and heiress, Margery (d.1384), married John de Cudworth (d.1384), from whom descended the Cudworths of Werneth Hall who were successive lords of the manor. A Member of this family was James I&#x27;s Chaplain, Ralph Cudworth (father of the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Ralph Cudworth). The Cudworths remained lords of the manor until their sale of the estate (1683) to Sir Ralph Assheton of Middleton.

=== Industrial Revolution and cotton ===

Much of Oldham&#x27;s history is concerned with textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution; it has been said that &quot;if ever the Industrial Revolution placed a town firmly and squarely on the map of the world, that town is Oldham.&quot; Oldham&#x27;s soils were too thin and poor to sustain crop growing, and so for decades prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local woollen weaving trade.

By 1756, Oldham had emerged as centre of the hatting industry in England. The rough felt used in the production process is the origin of the term &quot;Owdham Roughyed&quot; a nickname for people from Oldham. It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that Oldham changed from being a cottage industry township producing woollen garments via domestic manual labour, to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories. The climate, geology, and topography of Oldham were unrelenting constraints upon the social and economic activities of the human inhabitants. At above sea level and with no major river or visible natural resources, Oldham had poor geographic attributes compared with other settlements for investors and their engineers. As a result, Oldham played no part in the initial period of the Industrial Revolution, although it did later become seen as obvious territory to industrialise because of its convenient position between the labour forces of Manchester and southwest Yorkshire.

Cotton spinning and milling were introduced to Oldham when its first mill, Lees Hall, was built by William Clegg in about 1778, the beginning of a spiralling process of urbanisation and socioeconomic transformation. Within a year, 11 other mills had been constructed, and by 1818 there were 19 – not a large number in comparison with other local settlements. Oldham&#x27;s small local population was greatly increased by the mass migration of workers from outlying villages, resulting in a population increase from just over in 1801 to in 1901. The speed of this urban growth meant that Oldham, with little pre-industrial history to speak of, was effectively born as a factory town.
Oldham became the world&#x27;s manufacturing centre for cotton spinning in the second half of the 19th century. In 1851, over 30% of Oldham&#x27;s population was employed within the textile sector, compared to 5% across Great Britain. It overtook the major urban centres of Manchester and Bolton as the result of a mill building boom in the 1860s and 1870s, a period during which Oldham became the most productive cotton-spinning town in the world. In 1871, Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. By 1911 there were 16.4 million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58 million in the United Kingdom and 143.5 million in the world; in 1928, with the construction of the UK&#x27;s largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were more than 360 mills, operating night and day;

Oldham&#x27;s townscape was dominated by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills. Oldham was hit hard by the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut off. Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased with the intention of employing local cotton workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the 20th century, Oldham&#x27;s economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton spinning. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.

==== Engineering ====
Facilitated by its flourishing textile industry, Oldham developed extensive structural and mechanical engineering sectors during the 18th and 19th centuries. The manufacture of spinning and weaving machinery in Oldham belongs to the last decade of the 19th century, when it became a leading centre in the field of engineering. The Platt Brothers, originated in nearby Dobcross village, but moved to Oldham. They were pioneers of cotton-spinning machinery, developing innovative products that enabled the mass-production of cotton yarn. Platt Brothers became the largest textile machine makers in the world, employing over people in the 1890s, twice the number of their nearest rivals Dobson &amp; Barlow in Bolton and Asa Lees on Greenacres Moor. They were keen investors in the local area and at one time, were supporting 42% of the population. The centre of the company lay at the New Hartford Works in Werneth, a massive complex of buildings and internal railways on a site overlooking Manchester. The railway station which served this site later formed the basis of Oldham Werneth railway station. The main building exists to this day. Platts gained prestigious awards from around the world, and were heavily involved with local politics and civic pride in Oldham. John and James Platt were the largest subscribers for promoting Oldham from a township to a Borough, pledging £100 (more than double the next largest sum) in advance towards any expenses which may have been incurred by the Royal Charter. In 1854 John Platt was made the (fourth) Mayor of Oldham, an office he was to hold twice more in 1855–56 and 1861–62. John Platt was elected in 1865 to become a Member of Parliament (MP) for Oldham, and was re-elected in 1868; he remained in office until his death in 1872. A bronze statue of Platt existed in the town centre for years, though was moved to Alexandra Park. There have been recommendations for it to be returned to the town centre.

Abraham Henthorn Stott, the son of a stonemason, was born in nearby Shaw &amp; Crompton in 1822. He served a seven-year apprenticeship with Sir Charles Barry, before starting a structural engineering practice in Oldham in 1847 that went on to become the pre-eminent mill architect firm in Lancashire. Philip Sydney Stott, third son of Abraham and later titled as Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet, was the most prominent and famous of the Stott mill architects. He established his own practice in 1883 and designed over a hundred mills in several countries. His factories, which improved upon his father&#x27;s fireproof mills, accounted for a 40% increase in Oldham&#x27;s spindles between 1887 and 1914.

Although textile-related engineering declined with the processing industry, leading to the demise of both Stotts and Platts, other engineering firms existed, notably electrical and later electronic engineers Ferranti in 1896. Ferranti went into receivership in 1993, but some of its former works continue in other hands. Part of the original Hollinwood site was operated by Siemens Metering and Semiconductor divisions. The remainder of the site is occupied by Mirror Colour Print Ltd; the printing division of Reach, which prints and distributes thirty-six major newspapers, and employs five hundred staff.

==== Coal mining ====
On the back of the Industrial Revolution, Oldham developed an extensive coal mining sector, correlated to supporting the local cotton industry and the town&#x27;s inhabitants, though there is evidence of small scale coal mining in the area as early as the 16th century. The Oldham Coalfield stretched from Royton in the north to Bardsley in the south and in addition to Oldham, included the towns of Middleton and Chadderton to the west. The Oldham Coalfield was the site of over 150 collieries during its recorded history. Although some contemporary sources suggest there was coal mining in Oldham at a commercial scale by 1738, older sources attribute the commercial expansion of coal mining with the arrival in the town of two Welsh labourers, John Evans and William Jones, around 1770. Foreseeing the growth in demand for coal as a source of steam power, they acquired colliery rights for Oldham, which by 1771 had 14 colliers. The mines were largely to the southwest of the town around Hollinwood and Werneth and provided enough coal to accelerate Oldham&#x27;s rapid development at the centre of the cotton boom. At its height in the mid-19th century, when it was dominated by the Lees and Jones families, Oldham coal was mainly sourced from many small collieries whose lives varied from a few years to many decades, although two of the four largest collieries survived to nationalisation. In 1851, collieries employed more than 2,000 men in Oldham, although the amount of coal in the town was somewhat overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry. Today, the only visible remnants of the mines are disused shafts and boreholes.

=== Social history ===

Oldham&#x27;s social history, like that of other former unenfranchised towns, is marked by politicised civil disturbances, as well as events related to the Luddite, Suffragette and other Labour movements from the working classes. There has been a significant presence of &quot;friendly societies&quot;. It has been put that the people of Oldham became radical in politics in the early part of the 19th century, and movements suspected of sedition found patronage in the town. Oldham was frequently disturbed by bread and labour riots, facilitated by periods of scarcity and the disturbance of employment following the introduction of cotton-spinning machinery.

On 20 April 1812, a &quot;large crowd of riotous individuals&quot; compelled local retailers to sell foods at a loss, whilst on the same day Luddites numbering in their thousands, many of whom were from Oldham, attacked a cotton mill in nearby Middleton. On 16 August 1819, Oldham sent a contingent estimated at well above 10,000 to hear speakers in St Peter&#x27;s Fields at Manchester discuss political reform; it was the largest contingent sent to Manchester. John Lees, a cotton operative and ex-soldier who had fought at Waterloo, was one of the fifteen victims of the Peterloo Massacre which followed. The &#x27;Oldham inquest&#x27; which proceeded the massacre was anxiously watched; the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, however, decided that the proceedings were irregular, and the jury were discharged without giving a verdict.

Annie Kenney, born in nearby Springhead, and who worked in Oldham&#x27;s cotton mills, was a notable member of the Suffragette movement credited with sparking off suffragette militancy when she heckled Winston Churchill, and later (with Emmeline Pankhurst) the first Suffragist to be imprisoned. Oldham Women&#x27;s Suffrage Society was established in 1910 with Margery Lees as president and quickly joined the Manchester and District Federation of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies. The Chartist and Co-operative movements had strong support in the town, whilst many Oldhamers protested in support of the emancipation of slaves. The Riot Act was read in 1852 on election day following a mass public brawl over the Reform Act, and irregularities with parliamentary candidate nominations.

For three days in late May 2001, Oldham became the centre of national and international media attention. Following high-profile race-related conflicts, and long-term underlying racial tensions between local White British against British Pakistani and British Bangladeshi communities, major riots broke out in the town. Occurring with particular intensity in the Glodwick and Coldhurst areas of the town, the 2001 Oldham riots were the worst racially motivated riots in the United Kingdom for fifteen years prior, briefly eclipsing the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland in the media. At least 20 people were injured in the riots, including 15 police officers, and 37 people were arrested. Similar riots took place in other towns in northern England over the following days and weeks. The 2001 riots prompted governmental and independent inquiries, which collectively agreed on community relations improvements and considerable regeneration schemes for the town. There were further fears of riots after the death of Gavin Hopley in 2002.

== Governance ==

=== Civic history ===

Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Oldham was recorded in 1212 as being one of five parts of the thegnage estate of Kaskenmoor, which was held on behalf of King John by Roger de Montbegon and William de Nevill. The other parts of this estate were Crompton, Glodwick, Sholver, and Werneth. Oldham later formed a township within the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham, in the hundred of Salford.

In 1826 commissioners for the social and economic improvement of Oldham were established. The town was made part of a parliamentary borough, in 1832, though it was in 1849 when Oldham was incorporated as a municipal borough, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom, and in 1850 the Borough Council obtained the powers of the improvement commissioners. In 1880, parts of the Hollinwood and Crossbank areas of Chadderton and Ashton-under-Lyne townships were added to the Borough of Oldham. Oldham Above Town and Oldham Below Town were, from 1851 until c. 1881, statistical units used for the gathering and organising of civil registration information, and output of census data.

The Local Government Act 1888 created elected county councils to administer services throughout England and Wales. Where a municipal borough had a population of more than 50,000 at the 1881 Census it was created a county borough, with the powers and duties of both a borough and county council. As Oldham had an 1881 population of 111,343 it duly became a county borough on 1 April 1889. The borough, while independent of Lancashire County Council for local government, remained part of the county for purposes such as the administration of justice and lieutenancy.

In 1951 parts of the Limehurst Rural District were added to the County Borough of Oldham, and in 1954 further parts of the same district added to it on its abolition. Since 1961, Oldham has been twinned with Kranj in Slovenia. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town&#x27;s autonomous county borough status was abolished, and Oldham has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, within the Metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

=== Parliamentary representation ===
The boundaries of two parliamentary constituencies divide Oldham: Oldham East and Saddleworth, and Oldham West and Royton (which includes the town centre), represented by Labour Members of Parliament (MPs) Debbie Abrahams and Jim McMahon respectively.

Created as a parliamentary borough in 1832, Oldham&#x27;s first parliamentary representatives were the radicals William Cobbett and John Fielden. Winston Churchill began his political career in Oldham. Although unsuccessful at his first attempt in 1899, Churchill was elected as the member of Parliament for the Oldham parliamentary borough constituency in the 1900 general election. He held the constituency for the Conservative Party until the 1906 general election, when he won the election for Manchester North West as a Liberal MP. After he became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1940, Churchill was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Oldham, on 2 April 1941.
=== Politics ===
In the 2016 European Union membership referendum, Oldham voted in favour of Brexit. The vote to leave was 60.9%.

== Geography ==

At (53.5444°, −2.1169°), and north-northwest of London, Oldham stands above sea level, northeast of Manchester city centre, on elevated ground between the rivers Irk and Medlock. Saddleworth and the South Pennines are close to the east, whilst on all other sides, Oldham is bound by other neighbouring towns, including Ashton-under-Lyne, Chadderton, Failsworth, Royton and Shaw and Crompton, with little or no green space between them. Oldham experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. On 23 November 1981, an F1/T2 tornado formed over Hollinwood and later passed over Oldham town centre, causing some damage.

Oldham&#x27;s topography is characterised by its rugged, elevated Pennine terrain. It has an area of . The geology of Oldham is represented by the Millstone Grit and Coal Measures series of rocks. The River Beal, flowing northwards, forms the boundary between Oldham on one side and Royton and Shaw and Crompton on the other.

To the east of this river the surface rises to a height of at Woodward Hill, on the border with the parish of Saddleworth. The rest of the surface is hilly, the average height decreasing towards the southwest to Failsworth and the city of Manchester. The ridge called Oldham Edge, high, comes southward from Royton into the centre of the town.
Oldham&#x27;s built environment is characterised by its 19th-century red-brick terraced houses, the infrastructure that was built to support these and the town&#x27;s former cotton mills – which mark the town&#x27;s skyline. The urban structure of Oldham is irregular when compared to most towns in England, its form restricted in places by its hilly upland terrain. There are irregularly constructed residential dwellings and streets clustered loosely around a central business district in the town centre, which is the local centre of commerce. In 1849, Angus Reach of Inverness said: 

In the 1870s, John Marius Wilson described Oldham as consisting of:
 Although Oldham had a thriving economy during the 19th century, the local merchants were broadly reluctant to spend on civic institutions, and so the town lacks the grandeur seen in comparable nearby towns like Bolton or Huddersfield; public expenditure was seen as an overhead that undermined the competitiveness of the town. Subsequently, Oldham&#x27;s architecture has been described as &quot;mediocre&quot;. The town has no listed buildings with a Grade I rating.

There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Oldham. There is some permanent grassland but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The territory of Oldham is contiguous with other towns on all sides except for a small section along its eastern and southern boundaries, and for purposes of the Office for National Statistics, forms the fourth largest settlement of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom&#x27;s third largest conurbation. The M60 motorway passes through the southwest of Oldham, through Hollinwood, and a heavy rail line enters Oldham from the same direction, travelling northeast to the town centre before heading northwards through Derker towards Shaw and Crompton.

=== Divisions and suburbs ===
Many of Oldham&#x27;s present divisions and suburbs have origins as pre-industrial hamlets, manorial commons and ancient chapelries. Some, such as Moorside, exist as recently constructed residential suburbia, whilst places like Hollinwood exist as electoral wards and thoroughly industrialised districts. Throughout most of its recorded history, Oldham was surrounded by large swathes of moorland, which is reflected in the placenames of Moorside, Greenacres moor, Littlemoor, Northmoor among others.

A large portion of Oldham&#x27;s residences are &quot;low value&quot; Victorian era Accrington red-brick terraced houses in a row formation, built for the most part from 1870 to 1920, to house the town&#x27;s cotton mill workers. There is more modern housing in the semi-rural east of the town, in the most sought after area in areas such as the village Moorside, although terraces are found in almost all parts of Oldham.

One of the oldest recorded named places of Oldham is Hathershaw, occurring in a deed for 1280 with the spelling &quot;Halselinechaw Clugh&quot;. Existing as a manor in the 15th century, Hathershaw Hall was the home of a Royalist family in the 17th century who lost part of their possessions due to the English Civil War. Waterhead, an upland area in the east of Oldham, traces its roots to a water cornmill over the border in Lees.

Recorded originally as &quot;Watergate&quot; and &quot;Waterhead Milne&quot;, it was for a long time a hamlet in the parish of Oldham that formed a significant part of the Oldham Above Town registration sub-district. Derker was recorded as a place of residence in 1604 with the name &quot;Dirtcar&quot;. Bound by Higginshaw to the north, Derker is the location of Derker railway station and, said to have terraced residencies &quot;unsuited to modern needs&quot;, is currently being redeveloped as part of the Housing Market Renewal Initiative.

Coldhurst, an area along Oldham&#x27;s northern boundary with Royton, was once a chapelry and the site of considerable industry and commerce, including coal mining, cotton spinning and hat manufacture. It is said to have been the scene of an action in the English Civil War in which the Parliamentarians were defeated.

== Demography ==


According to data from the United Kingdom Census 2001, Oldham had a total resident population of 103,544, making it the 55th most populous settlement in England, and the 5th most populous settlement of the Greater Manchester Urban Area. This figure in conjunction with its area provides Oldham with a population density of . The local population has been described as broadly &quot;working class&quot;; the middle classes tending to live in outlying settlements.

Oldham, considered as a combination of the 2001 electoral wards of Alexandra, Coldhurst, Hollinwood, St. James, St. Marys, St. Pauls, Waterhead and Werneth, has an average age of 33.5, and compared against the average demographics of the United Kingdom, has a high level of people of South Asian heritage, particularly those with roots in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Due to the town&#x27;s prevalence as an industrial centre and thus a hub for employment, Oldham attracted migrant workers throughout its history, including those from wider-England, Scotland, Ireland and Poland.

During the 1950s and 1960s, in an attempt to fill the shortfall of workers and revitalise local industries, citizens of the wider Commonwealth of Nations were encouraged to migrate to Oldham and other British towns. Many came from the Caribbean and Indian subcontinent and settled throughout the Oldham borough.

Today, Oldham has large communities with heritage from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and parts of the Caribbean. At the time of the 2001 census, over one in four of its residents identified themselves as from a South Asian or British Asian ethnic group. Cultural divisions along ethnic backgrounds are strong within the town, with poor cross-community integration and cohesion along Asian and white backgrounds.

With only a small local population during medieval times, as a result of the introduction of industry, mass migration of village workers into Oldham occurred, resulting in a population change from under 2,000 in 1714 to 12,000 in 1801 to 137,000 in 1901 In 1851 its population of 52,820 made Oldham the 12th most populous town in England. The following is a table outlining the population change of the town since 1801, which demonstrates a trend of rapid population growth in the 19th century and, after peaking at 147,483 people in 1911, a trend of general decline in population size during the 20th century.

In 2011, 77.5% of the Oldham metropolitan borough population were White British, 18.1% Asian and 1.2% Black. While in the town of Oldham, which had a 2011 population of 96,555, 55.4% of the population were White British, 37.6% Asian and 2% Black.

== Economy ==
For years Oldham&#x27;s economy was heavily dependent on manufacturing industry, especially textiles and mechanical engineering. Since the deindustrialisation of Oldham in the mid-20th century, these industries have been replaced by home shopping, publishing, healthcare and food processing sectors, though factory-generated employment retains a significant presence. Many of the modern sectors are low-skill and low-wage.
Oldham&#x27;s town centre contains the highest concentration of retailing, cultural facilities and employment in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. It has been extensively redeveloped during the last few decades, and its two shopping centres, Town Square and the Spindles, now provide one of the largest covered retail areas in Greater Manchester. The Spindles (named with reference to textile spindles) is a modern shopping centre with over 40 retailers, banks, building societies and catering outlets. It houses several of Europe&#x27;s largest stained glass works, a series of ceilings and skylights created by local artist Brian Clarke in celebration of the life and music of one of Oldham&#x27;s famous sons, composer and conductor Sir William Walton.

A number of culinary and medical advances have been developed in Oldham. The tubular bandage was invented and developed in Oldham in 1961. That &quot;vital contribution to advancing medical science&quot; resulted from a collaboration between local firm Seton and a cotton manufacturer in the town. There are claims that Oldham was the birthplace of the first chip shop. The sometimes disputed claim of trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes is said to have been started around 1858–60 from an outlet owned by a John Lees, on what is the present site of Oldham&#x27;s Tommyfield Market. In 1900 Oldham had the highest concentration of chip shops in the country, one for every 400 people. Rag Pudding is a savoury dish said to be native to Oldham. Yates Wine Lodge was founded in Oldham by Peter and Simon Yates in 1884.

Park Cake Bakeries, sold in 2007 by Northern Foods Group to Vision Capital, have a large food processing centre in Hathershaw, which employs in excess of 1,600 people. Over 90% of the cakes produced go to Marks &amp; Spencer. Long existing as an industrial district, Hollinwood is home to the Northern Counties Housing Association,

Ferranti Technologies is an electronic, electromechanical and electrical engineering company based in Waterhead.

The majority of poor families are now working families. Coldhurst in Oldham has child deprivation rate of 62.1pc, which is the worst in the UK.
Oldham Athletic&#x27;s contribution to the local economy have been strengthened by its community links as well as its fortunes on the field. Despite some success in the early 20th century which almost saw the club win the Football League title in 1915, the club has spent most of its time outside the top division of English football, including a 68-year spell between 1923 and 1991 – when it won promotion to the First Division a year before it became the FA Premier League. The club then survived for three years in the FA Premier League, which encouraged high attendances and boosted the club&#x27;s finances as well as boosting the local economy as it struggled to recover from post-industrial decline. Between 1990 and 1994, the club also reached two FA Cup semi-finals (taking Manchester United to a replay on both occasions) and were on the losing side in a Football League Cup final. The club&#x27;s subsequent years, however, have been less successful, with relegation in 2018 to the fourth tier of the English league for the first time in almost 50 years. The club&#x27;s financial situation has also declined, as have its attendances, in accordance with fortunes on the pitch.

== Landmarks ==


=== Town Hall ===
Oldham&#x27;s Old Town Hall is a Grade II listed Georgian neo-classical town hall built in 1841, eight years before Oldham received its borough status. One of the last purpose-built town halls in northwest England, it has a tetrastyle Ionic portico, copied from the temple of Ceres, on the River Ilissos, near Athens. Winston Churchill made his inaugural acceptance speech from the steps of the town hall when he was first elected as a Conservative MP in 1900. A Blue Plaque on the exterior of the building commemorates the event. Long existing as the political centre of the town, complete with courtrooms, the structure stood empty for many years from the mid-1980s and was regularly earmarked for redevelopment as part of regeneration project proposals, but none were actioned before plans dating to 2012 were completed in 2016.

In September 2008, it was reported that &quot;Oldham Town Hall is only months away from a major roof collapse&quot;. A tour taken by local councillors and media concluded with an account that &quot;chunks of masonry are falling from the ceilings on a daily basis ... the floors are littered with dead pigeons and ... revealed that the building is literally rotting away&quot;. In October 2009 the Victorian Society, a charity responsible for the study and protection of Britain&#x27;s Victorian and Edwardian architecture, declared Oldham Town Hall as the most endangered Victorian structure in England and Wales.
Plans to convert the hall into a leisure complex, incorporating a cinema and restaurants, were revealed in May 2012 with the hall itself being used for public consultation. This £36.72 million project was completed in 2016.

In the heart of Oldham&#x27;s retail district, the Old Town Hall has been developed into a modern multiplex Odeon cinema.

=== War memorial ===

Erected as a permanent memorial to the men of Oldham who were killed in the First World War, Oldham&#x27;s war memorial consists of a granite base surmounted by a bronze sculpture depicting five soldiers making their way along the trenches in order to go into battle. The main standing figure, having climbed out of the trenches, is shown calling on his comrades to advance, and is the same figure used at the Royal Fusiliers War Memorial in London and the 41st Division memorial at Flers in France. The base serves to house books containing the roll of honour of the 1st, 10th and 24th Battalions, Manchester Regiment. The pedestal has two bronze doors at either side.

Commissioned in 1919 by the Oldham War Memorial Committee, the memorial was designed and built by Albert Toft. It was unveiled by General Sir Ian Hamilton on 28 April 1923, before a crowd estimated at over 10,000. The monument was intended to symbolise the spirit of 1914–1918.

The inscriptions on the memorial read:

* Over doors to the north: &quot;DEATH IS THE GATE OF LIFE / 1914–1918&quot;
* Over window to the south: &quot;TO GOD BE THE PRAISE &quot;

=== Civic Centre ===
The Civic Centre tower is the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham&#x27;s centre of local governance. The chamber of the Mayor of Oldham can be located in the Civic Centre. The 15-storey white-brick building has housed the vast majority of the local government&#x27;s offices since its completion in 1977. Standing at the summit of the town, the tower stands over high. It was designed by Cecil Howitt &amp; Partners, and the topping out ceremony was held on 18 June 1976. The Civic Centre can be seen as far away as Salford, Trafford, Wythenshawe and Winter Hill in Lancashire, and offers panoramic views across the city of Manchester and the Cheshire Plain.

=== Churches ===

The Oldham Parish Church of St. Mary with St. Peter, in its present form, dates from 1830 and was designed in the Gothic Revival Style by Richard Lane, a Manchester-based architect. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. It was linked with the church of St Mary the Virgin, Prestwich and together the sites were principal churches of the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham.

A church building had existed on the site since 1280. During this time, a small chapel stood on the site to serve the local townships of Oldham, Chadderton, Royton and Crompton. This was later replaced by an Early English Gothic church in the 15th century. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, the population of Oldham increased at a rapid rate (from under 2,000 in 1714, to over 32,000 by 1831). The rapid growth of the local population warranted that the building be rebuilt into the current structure. Though the budget was originally agreed at £5,000, the final cost of building was £30,000, one third of which was spent on the crypt structure. Alternative designs by Sir Charles Barry, the designer of the Palace of Westminster, although now regarded by some as superior, were rejected. The Church, of the Anglican denomination, is in active use for worship, and forms part of the Diocese of Manchester.

There are also Roman Catholic churches in Oldham. These include Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St Patrick Church. It was built in 1870, was founded by priests from St Mary&#x27;s Church in Oldham, and is a Grade II listed building.

== Transport ==

The geography of Oldham constrained the development of major transport infrastructure, with the former County Borough Council suggesting that &quot;if it had not grown substantially before the railway age it would surely have been overlooked&quot;. Oldham has never been on a main-line railway route, and canals too have only been able to serve it from a distance, meaning that &quot;Oldham has never had a train service worthy of a town of its size&quot;.

A principal destination along the former Oldham Loop Line, Oldham once had six railway stations but this was reduced to three once Clegg Street, Oldham Central and Glodwick Road closed in the mid-20th century. Oldham Werneth, Oldham Mumps and Derker closed on 3 October 2009. Trains from Manchester Victoria station to Oldham had to climb steeply through much of its route, from around at Manchester city centre to around at Oldham Mumps. The Werneth Incline, with its gradient of 1 in 27, made the Middleton Junction to Oldham Werneth route the steepest regular passenger line in the country. The Werneth Incline route closed in 1963. It had been replaced as the main route to Manchester by the section of line built between Oldham Werneth Station and Thorpes Bridge Junction, at Newton Heath in May 1880. Oldham Mumps, the second oldest station on the line after Werneth, took its name from its location in the Mumps area of Oldham, which itself probably derived from the archaic word &quot;mumper&quot; which was slang for a beggar. The former Oldham Loop Line was converted for use with an expanded Metrolink light rail network, and renamed as the Oldham and Rochdale Line. The line between Victoria and a temporary Oldham Mumps tram stop opened on 13 June 2012, and more central stops opened on 27 January 2014.

Oldham had electric tramways to Manchester in the early 20th century; the first tram was driven from Manchester into Oldham in 1900 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester. The system came to an end on 3 August 1946, however. There was also a short-lived Oldham trolleybus system, in 1925–26. Oldham bus station has frequent bus services to Manchester, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne and Middleton with other services to the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, Tameside, and across the Pennines to Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. The roof canopy is supported internally on two rows of steel trees. The extensive use of glass and stainless steel maximises visibility, and there is a carefully co-ordinated family of information fittings, posters and seating, using robust natural materials for floors and plinths. The bus station is used by National Express coaches. First Greater Manchester has its headquarters in Oldham.

Despite the Turnpike Act 1734, Oldham had no turnpike road to Manchester for another 56 years and Church Lane, Oldham remained part of the main street through the town. But following a further Act of Parliament a turnpike was constructed. The first regular coach service to Manchester came into operation in October 1790, with a journey time of over 2 hours and a fare 2s.8d (about 13p), with half fare for travellers on top of the coach.

Oldham is about south of the major M62 motorway, but is linked to it by the M60 at Hollinwood, and A627(M) via Chadderton. There are major A roads to Ashton-under-Lyne, Huddersfield, Manchester, and Rochdale.

The Hollinwood Branch of the Ashton Canal was a canal that ran from Fairfield in Droylsden, through Littlemoss and Daisy Nook Country Park to the Hollinwood area of Oldham, with a branch from Daisy Nook to the Fairbottom Branch Canal. The canal was mainly used for the haulage of coal until it fell into disuse for commercial traffic in the 1930s. It included four aqueducts and a two-rise lock staircase.

== Sport ==

Oldham Rugby League Football Club was established in 1876 as Oldham Football Club. Renamed in 1997 to Oldham R.L.F.C., it has achieved several club honours during its history, winning the Rugby Football League Championship five times and Challenge Cup three times. They played at Watersheddings for years before joining Oldham Athletic A.F.C. at Boundary Park until 2010 when they moved to Oldham Borough&#x27;s previous ground, Whitebank Stadium.

Oldham Athletic Association Football Club, known as The Latics, was founded in 1895 as Pine Villa Football Club. Oldham Athletic have achieved both league and cup successes, particularly under Joe Royle in the 1990s. They were Football League runners-up in the last season before the outbreak of the First World War, but were relegated from the First Division in 1923. They reached the League Cup final in 1990 and won the Second Division title in 1991, ending 68 years outside the top flight. They secured their top division status a year later to become founder members of the new Premier League, but were relegated after two seasons despite reaching that year&#x27;s FA Cup semi-finals. A long slow fall through the divisions followed this relegation, until they established the unwanted record of being the first ever former Premier League club to lose their Football League status at the end of the 2021–22 season. As of the 2022–23 season they play in the National League, the fifth tier of the English football pyramid.

Oldham Borough was established in 1964 as Oldham Dew FC, and after many years playing under the name of Oldham Town changed its name to Oldham Boro in 2009, finally becoming known as Oldham Borough just months before it folded. The team played in the North West Counties Football League before going out of existence in 2015, just over fifty years after it was founded.

Oldham Netball Club&#x27;s senior team is the 2019–2020 national league division 1 champion and has won seven out of the last eight titles. Former players include England&#x27;s most capped player Jade Clarke.

Oldham has league cricket teams with a number of semi-professional league clubs including Oldham CC, and Werneth CC, both playing in the Greater Manchester Cricket League (GMCL). Oldham CC was one of the founding members, in 1892, of the Central Lancashire Cricket League, which closed in 2015.

The Manchester Fencing Centre in Oldham opened in 2015 in the former Osborne Mill, and at was said to be &quot;the largest centre of its kind&quot;. The Marshall Fencing Club trains there, under head coach and Commonwealth games medallist Stuart Marshall, and in 2019 won six gold medals at eight national ranking events.

University Campus Oldham is a centre for higher education and a sister campus of the University of Huddersfield. It was opened in May 2005 by actor Patrick Stewart, the centre&#x27;s Chancellor. The University Campus Oldham presented actress Shobna Gulati and artist, Brian Clarke (both born in Oldham) with an Honorary Doctorate of Letters at the Graduation Ceremony of November 2006, for their achievements and contributions to Oldham and its community.

== Public services ==
Home Office policing in Oldham is provided by the Greater Manchester Police. The force&#x27;s &quot;(Q) Division&quot; have their headquarters for policing the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham at central Oldham. Public transport is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, which has two stations in Oldham; at Hollins on Hollins Road, and at Clarksfield on Lees Road.

The Royal Oldham Hospital, at Oldham&#x27;s northern boundary with Royton, is a large NHS hospital administered by Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. It was opened under its existing name on 1 December 1989. Formerly known as Oldham District and General, and occupying the site of the town&#x27;s former workhouse (named Oldham Union Workhouse in 1851), the hospital is notable for being the birthplace of Louise Joy Brown – the world&#x27;s first successful &quot;In vitro&quot; fertilised &quot;test tube baby&quot;, on 25 July 1978.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. Locally produced inert waste for disposal is sent to landfill at the Beal Valley. Oldham&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is United Utilities; there are no power stations in the town. United Utilities also manages Oldham&#x27;s drinking and waste water; water supplies being sourced from several local reservoirs, including Dove Stone and Chew. There is a water treatment works at Waterhead.

== Culture ==

Oldham, though lacking in leisure and cultural amenities, is historically notable for its theatrical culture. Once having a peak of six &quot;fine&quot; theatres in 1908, Oldham is home to the Oldham Coliseum Theatre and the Oldham Theatre Workshop, which have facilitated the early careers of notable actors and writers, including Eric Sykes, Bernard Cribbins and Anne Kirkbride, daughter of acclaimed cartoonist Jack Kirkbride who worked for the &quot;Oldham Evening Chronicle&quot;. Oldham Coliseum Theatre is one of Britain&#x27;s last remaining repertory theatres; Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel performed there in the early 20th century, and contemporary actors such as Ralph Fiennes and Minnie Driver, among others, have appeared more recently.

During the 19th century the circus was a popular entertainment in Oldham; Pablo Fanque&#x27;s circus was a regular visitor, filling a 3,000-seat amphitheatre on Tommyfield in 1869. Formerly criticised for its lack of a cinema, there are plans to develop an &quot;Oldham West End&quot;. 
The Lyceum is a Grade II listed building opened in 1856 at a cost of £6,500 as a &quot;mutual improvement&quot; centre for the working men of Oldham. The facilities provided to members included a library, a newsroom and a series of lectures on geology, geography and education, microscopy and chemistry, female education and botany. Instrumental music was introduced and there were soon sixteen violinists and three cellists. Eventually the building was extended to include a school of science and art. Music had always been important in the life of the Lyceum, and in 1892 a school of music was opened, with 39 students enrolled for the &quot;theory and practice of music&quot;.

The Lyceum continued throughout the 20th century as a centre for the arts in Oldham. The Lyceum Players are a current amateur theatre company entering its 93rd year. They put on a varied programme of productions each season and the theatre is on the ground floor of the Lyceum building. In 1986 the local authority was invited by its directors and trustees to accept the building as a gift. The acceptance of the Lyceum building by the Education Committee provided the opportunity to move the music centre and &quot;further enhance the cultural activities of the town&quot;. In 1989 the Oldham Metropolitan Borough Music Centre moved into the Lyceum building, which is now the home of the Oldham Lyceum School of Music.

Oldham&#x27;s museum and gallery service dates back to 1883. Since then it has established itself as a cultural focus for Oldham and has developed one of the largest and most varied permanent collections in North West England. The current collection includes over 12,000 social and industrial history items, more than 2,000 works of art, about 1,000 items of decorative art, more than 80,000 natural history specimens, over 1,000 geological specimens, about 3,000 archaeological artefacts, 15,000 photographs and a large number of books, pamphlets and documents. Meanwhile, the Rifle Street drill hall dates back to 1897.

Oldham is now home to a newly built state-of-the-art art gallery, Gallery Oldham, which was completed in February 2002 as the first phase of the Oldham Cultural Quarter. Later phases of the development saw the opening of an extended Oldham Library, a lifelong learning centre and there are plans to include a performing arts centre.

=== Carnival ===
The annual Oldham Carnival started around 1900, although the tradition of carnivals in the town goes back much further, providing a &quot;welcomed respite from the tedium of everyday life&quot;. The carnival parade was always held in mid-to-late summer, with the primary aim of raising money for charities. It often featured local dignitaries or popular entertainers, in addition to brass, military and jazz bands, the Carnival Queen, people in fancy dress, dancers and decorated floats from local churches and businesses. Whenever possible, local people who had attained national celebrity status were invited to join the cavalcade. The carnival&#x27;s route began in the town centre, wound its way along King Street, and ended with a party in Alexandra Park.

The carnival fell out of favour in the late 1990s but was resurrected by community volunteers in 2006 and rebranded the Peoples&#x27; Carnival. The parade was moved into Alexandra Park in 2011. The event hosts live stages and other activities alongside a parade in the park. 2016 marked ten years since the carnival was reinstated by volunteers. The main organiser is Paul Davies who runs the carnival with a number of committee members and volunteers.

<text>A majordomo () is a person who speaks, makes arrangements, or takes charge for another. Typically, this is the highest (&quot;major&quot;) person of a household (&quot;domūs&quot; or &quot;domicile&quot;) staff, a head servant who acts on behalf of the owner of a large or significant residence.

A majordomo may also, more informally, be someone who oversees the day-to-day responsibilities of a business enterprise. Historically, many institutions and governments – monasteries, cathedrals, and cities – as well as noble and royal houses, also had the post of majordomo, who usually was in charge of finances.

Additionally, the Hispanos of New Mexico use the related term &quot;mayordomo&quot; to refer to the manager of an &quot;acequia&quot; system for a town or valley. Also, when translated into English, &quot;mayordomo&quot; means butler.

The origin is from , and it was borrowed into English from Spanish or Old Italian . Also, it is found as French , modern Italian , Portuguese and Galician , and Romanian and Catalan as .

== In television ==
On a few episodes of the TV sitcom &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, the Clampetts visit a castle in England and meet the castle&#x27;s majordomo, Mr. Faversham, but constantly mistake his title for his name (and mistake his name for a greeting.)

In the original run of the 1980s TV series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, Jonathan Higgins is sometimes referred to as the majordomo of the estate where he and Magnum live, though he typically referred to himself as the estate caretaker or estate manager.

In the original run of the nighttime drama &quot;Dynasty&quot;, the majordomo of the Carrington residence is Joseph Anders, played by Lee Bergere during seasons 1–3. The character dies by a self-inflicted gunshot wound early in season 4.

<doc id="179459" wikidata="Q623255" url="?curid=179459" title="Project Censored">
<text>Project Censored is an American nonprofit media watchdog organization. The group&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;educate students and the public about the importance of a truly free press for democratic self-government.&quot;

Project Censored produces an annual book, published by Seven Stories Press and the Censored Press, and a weekly radio program. Both the annual books and the weekly radio programs, as well as public events sponsored by the Project, focus on issues of news censorship, propaganda, free speech, and politics. 
Project Censored was founded at Sonoma State University in 1976 by Carl Jensen (1929-2015). Since 2010, Mickey Huff has been the group&#x27;s director. It is sponsored by the Media Freedom Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, established in 2000. The organization is based in Fair Oaks, California.

== History ==
&quot;Project Censored&quot; was founded in 1976 by Carl Jensen, Associate Professor of Media Studies at Sonoma State College, as a media research program. The project focused on student media literacy and critical thinking skills as applied to the US news media censorship.

Corporate media reporters, editors, and executives lampooned Jensen for claiming they &quot;censored&quot; news stories. They argued that the stories were not censored, but that due to time and space constraints, they could not publish every story. Jensen began an annual study that found that, rather than covering newsworthy stories, the corporate media often featured trivial and non-newsworthy stories, which Jensen termed &quot;junk food news&quot; in a 1983 interview published in &quot;Penthouse&quot;. Since the first &quot;Censored&quot; yearbook, published in 1993, each annual &quot;Censored&quot; volume has featured a chapter dedicated to exposing examples of what Jensen originally identified as &quot;junk food news&quot;.

In 1996, when Jensen retired, Peter Phillips, also a sociology professor at Sonoma State University, became director of Project Censored. He continued to expand the Project&#x27;s educational outreach and the annual book, adding the concept and analysis of &quot;News Abuse&quot; to elaborate Jensen&#x27;s idea of &quot;junk food&quot; news. &quot;News abuse&quot; refers to corporate media stories that were newsworthy, but presented in a slanted or non-newsworthy manner.

In 2000, Project Censored came under the oversight of the non-profit Media Freedom Foundation, founded by Jensen and Phillips to ensure its independence. In 2007, two of Project Censored judges resigned due to then-director Peter Phillips&#x27; decision to invite Steven E. Jones, a 9/11 Truth conspiracy theorist, as the keynote speaker to the Project&#x27;s annual conference.

Mickey Huff of Diablo Valley College became director in 2010. He and associate director Andy Lee Roth have extended the Project beyond Sonoma State University and expanded the Campus Affiliates Program launched in 2009. The top &quot;Censored&quot; news stories are identified through the Campus Affiliates Program, a collaborative effort between faculty and students at many colleges and universities.

==Activities==

=== Publications ===
Since 1993, Project Censored has published its annual list of the most under-reported news stories in the form of a book. Since 1996, Seven Stories Press in New York has published each annual &quot;Censored&quot; book, totaling 27 volumes . The first Project Censored yearbook, &quot;Censored: The News That Didn’t Make the News—And Why&quot;, edited by Carl Jensen, was published by Shelburne Press in 1993. Two subsequent volumes, the 1994 and 1995 yearbooks, were published by Four Walls Eight Windows.

The most recent yearbook, &quot;State of the Free Press 2023&quot;, includes a foreword by Heidi Boghosian and is the second to be jointly published by Seven Stories Press and Project Censored&#x27;s own publishing imprint, the Censored Press. &quot;State of the Free Press 2023&quot; describes itself as &quot;[a]pplying the critical media literacy tools Project Censored has championed since 1976.&quot; The book &quot;exposes how the corporate media&#x27;s focus on &#x27;humilitainment&#x27; and &#x27;false balance&#x27; leads to slanted news, info-free clickbait, and censorship&quot; while advancing &quot;remedies for a more robust free press&quot; and providing &quot;inspiring models for grassroots engagement.&quot; &quot;State of the Free Press&quot; includes the Project&#x27;s list of what the group considers to be the most significant but under-reported news stories of 2021-2022.

In addition to being included in the &quot;Censored&quot; book series, the organization&#x27;s annual listing of the most significant but under-reported news stories, dating back to 1976, is archived on the Project Censored website. Previous years&#x27; &quot;Censored&quot; lists have been featured in U.S. national media outlets.

==== Censored Press ====
The Censored Press is a publishing imprint that was established in 2021 by the Media Freedom Foundation and Project Censored. The Censored Press has published a number of notable titles, including &quot;Going Remote: A Teacher&#x27;s Journey&quot;, &quot;Guilty of Journalism: The Political Case Against Julian Assange&quot;, and &quot;The Media and Me: A Guide to Critical Media Literacy for Young People&quot;, which was co-published by the Censored Press and Seven Stories Press.

===Radio program===
Since 2010, Project Censored has produced a weekly public affairs program originating from KPFA in Berkeley, California, part of the Pacifica Foundation. The Project Censored Radio Show is syndicated on 40 radio stations across North America.

===Documentary films===
Project Censored has been the subject of two feature-length documentary films. In 2013, Doug Hecker and Christopher Oscar produced and directed &quot;Project Censored: The Movie: Ending the Reign of Junk Food News&quot;. The film features interviews with and commentary by Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, Dan Rather, Phil Donahue, Michael Parenti, Greg Palast, Oliver Stone, Daniel Ellsberg, Peter Kuznick, Cynthia McKinney, Nora Barrows-Friedman, John Perkins, Jonah Raskin, Khalil Bendib, Abby Martin, and faculty and students associated with Project Censored.

&quot;Project Censored: The Movie&quot; screened at numerous film festivals, including its premiere at the Sonoma International Film Festival in April 2013, the Bend Film Festival in October 2013, and the Madrid International Film Festival in July 2013, where Doug Hecker and Christopher Oscar were recognized for Best Directing of a Feature Documentary.

In 1998, Differential Films released &quot;Project Censored: Is the Press Really Free?&quot;, directed and produced by Steven Keller. In May 2000, &quot;Project Censored: Is the Press Really Free?&quot; aired on PBS stations across the United States.

== Reception ==
Project Censored stories have been cited in both national and international media. Ralph Nader described Project Censored as &quot;a deep, wide and utterly engrossing exercise to unmask censorship, self-censorship, and propaganda in the mass media.&quot; In December 2013, Nader selected &quot;Censored 2014: Fearless Speech in Fateful Times&quot; as one of his &quot;10 Books to Provoke Conversation&quot; in 2014.

China News referenced their work in an editorial criticizing U.S. press practices. Iranian State News also cited Project Censored&#x27;s work on the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq to criticize U.S. foreign policy.

On the other hand, in 2000, Don Hazen, the first executive director of the progressive news analysis and commentary website &quot;AlterNet&quot;, criticized Project Censored as &quot;stuck in the past&quot; with a &quot;dubious selection process&quot; that &quot;reinforces self-marginalizing, defeatist behavior&quot;. It has also been criticized for reporting on stories that are arguably not &quot;under-reported&quot; or &quot;censored&quot; at all, as they have appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other such high-profile publications. Furthermore, the organization&#x27;s use of the term &quot;censorship&quot; to describe under-reported items, rather than governmentally censored material, has been called into question. William Powers, writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, called this broad use of the term &quot;pernicious and deceptive.&quot;

==Awards==
The 1995 edition of &quot;Censored: The News That Didn’t Make the News—And Why&quot; won the 1996 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Nonfiction.

In 2008, Project Censored received PEN Oakland&#x27;s Censorship award.

In July 2014, Mickey Huff and Andy Lee Roth received the National Whistleblowers Center&#x27;s Pillar Award for New Media on behalf of Project Censored.

<text>Victor Lewis-Smith (12 May 1957 – 10 December 2022) was a British film, television and radio producer, a television and restaurant critic, a satirist and newspaper columnist. He was executive producer of the ITV1 Annual National Food &amp; Drink Awards. He was an alumnus of the University of York and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Westminster in November 2008.

==Early life and personal life==
Lewis-Smith was born in 1957, the son of a neurosurgeon, and grew up in Chadwell Heath, Essex, although according to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, he &quot;never knowingly gave an interview discussing his parents, background or childhood.&quot; He was married to Virginia Stewart Duff.

He worked for Radio Medway before going on to study music at the University of York, where he presented the &quot;bizarre student TV show&quot; &quot;Intimate Freshness&quot; under the name &quot;Damien Filth&quot;. During his time as a student he was arrested, convicted and fined £20 for causing a public disturbance after climbing up scaffolding at York Minster in the middle of the night and reciting the adhan, the Muslim call to prayer, from a ledge, having previously played &quot;I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside&quot; on the cathedral&#x27;s organ. When asked in the magistrates&#x27; court hearing if he had anything to say, he replied: &quot;All my leftwing friends told me they were beaten up by the police when they were in custody. But nothing of the sort happened to me. What am I to tell them when we next meet?&quot;.

==Career==
===Production company===
Lewis-Smith owned a film, television and radio production company called Associated Rediffusion Productions Limited, having in 1990 acquired the rights to the name and logo of the original company, Associated-Rediffusion.

===Television===
====TV====

====As producer====
On 1 January 2021, the Sky Documentaries Channel aired &quot;Steve McQueen: The Lost Movie&quot;, presented by David Letterman.

Lewis-Smith&#x27;s documentary, &quot;The Undiscovered Peter Cook&quot;, was the first in a series transmitted on BBC Four in November 2016. In December 2018, Lewis-Smith made three more documentaries in the style of &quot;The Undiscovered Peter Cook&quot; for Sky Arts, this time concerning Peter Sellers, Kenneth Williams and Tony Hancock. Lewis-Smith was executive producer of a series of controversial documentaries presented by Keith Allen for Channel 4. This included biographies of Nick Griffin, then leader of the British National Party, Lottery winner Michael Carroll, the TV cook Keith Floyd (who died two hours before the programme was transmitted), and the &quot;child prodigy&quot; Lauren Harries.

Lewis-Smith was executive producer of a series of 44 television programmes called &quot;21st-Century Bach - The Complete Organ Works&quot;. The series started on BBC Two in June 2003 and ran for six years. The series has since aired on Sky Arts. John Scott Whiteley was the organist.

From 2010, Lewis-Smith was the executive producer of &quot;In Confidence&quot;, a series of one-to-one interviews, featuring leading figures from the arts. Presented by Laurie Taylor, this production for Sky Arts was well received in a television review by the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, with the &quot;Telegraph&quot; noting that &quot;In an age of soapy soundbites, Sky Arts hour-long interview strand is a serious attempt to delve deeper into its subjects.&quot; Guests included Peter Maxwell Davies, Lily Allen, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Richard Dawkins, Cleo Laine, Christopher Hitchens, Peter Hitchens, Kathy Burke and Stephen Fry.

===Radio and recording===
From 1983 to 1985 Lewis-Smith produced and presented the Sunday morning programme, &quot;Snooze Button&quot; for BBC Radio York. Following this he became a producer at BBC Radio 4, working on &quot;Start the Week&quot; and &quot;Midweek&quot;: during his stint on the latter programme he recruited cockney comedian Arthur Mullard as a stand-in host for regular presenter Libby Purves.

In 1986 he became a regular contributor to Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Colour Supplement&quot; and &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, developing a writing partnership with long-time collaborator Paul Sparks, also a former music student at York, and producing sketches combining music, special effects and toilet humour. During this time he won nine awards at the 1988 Independent Radio Advertising Awards (including the gold) for his Midland Bank student campaign.

In 1989 he made his first programme for BBC Radio 1, with producer John Walters, under the pseudonym Steve Nage.

Lewis-Smith&#x27;s company made two series of the comedy show &quot;Victor Lewis-Smith&quot; for BBC Radio 1, for which he won a Best Comedy Radio Programme award in the 1990 British Comedy Awards. A compilation of his spoof calls peaked at No.1 on the iTunes comedy chart on 27 July 2006. They attracted some controversy at the time of their first broadcast: in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; on 15 April 1990, Paul Donovan opined that Lewis-Smith&#x27;s hoaxes were &quot;repugnant&quot;. However, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Lucy Mangan described some of the recordings as being &quot;touched with genius&quot;. Writing about Lewis-Smith&#x27;s hoax phone calls in &quot;The Times Higher Education&quot;, Sally Feldman observed that &quot;He chooses his victims carefully, pricking the pompous and the powerful in the very best traditions of satire. His favourite target is the media, his pranks intended to expose their smugness, their laziness and their gullibility.&quot;

One of his prank calls was featured on the intro of &quot;Towers Of Dub&quot; on The Orb album U.F.Orb.

He released two recordings of his comedy, a CD &quot;Tested on Humans for Irritancy&quot; (Virgin Records, 1991) and a cassette &quot;Nuisance Calls&quot; (ARTV, 1996).

===Writing===
In the 1980s Lewis-Smith took over from Julie Burchill in writing weekly columns for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine. He also wrote weekly columns during the same period for the short-lived &quot;Sunday Correspondent&quot; and &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; (where he often substituted for Burchill), as well as &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. He was also a food critic for &quot;The Independent&quot;, and was restaurant critic for &quot;Harpers &amp; Queen&quot; magazine from 1995 to 1998 as well as &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where he combined comedy writing and food criticism.

In 1992, Lewis-Smith began a long association with the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, contributing daily television reviews along with other writers, as well as occasional restaurant reviews and travel articles. It was announced in June 2007 that he would be retiring from his daily television column.

Beginning in 1993, he was the compiler of the &quot;Funny Old World&quot; column of bizarre news items in &quot;Private Eye&quot;, where he replaced Christopher Logue. In 2011, he was living in Cumbria and never visited the magazine&#x27;s London office. He wrote a weekly page for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; for some years until 2003. From autumn 2004 to April 2005 he was the resident restaurant critic of &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Saturday magazine supplement.

His books included &quot;Buy-Gones&quot; and &quot;Inside the Magic Rectangle&quot;, a collection of his early &quot;Evening Standard&quot; TV reviews, and &quot;TV Reviews&quot;, a collection of his &quot;Evening Standard&quot; TV reviews since 2000 (published in 2011).

==Legal==
In June 2006, the television chef Gordon Ramsay, his production company and his producer accepted an out-of-court settlement of £75,000 from Associated Newspapers, after an article in London&#x27;s &quot;Evening Standard&quot; written by Lewis-Smith alleged that Ramsay had faked television scenes and installed an incompetent chef. Ramsay said at the time, &quot;We have never done anything in a cynical, fake way.&quot; However, a year later, Channel 4 admitted that a scene in another of Ramsay&#x27;s programmes had been faked, and apologised to viewers.

On 28 July 2006, hypnotist Paul McKenna successfully sued the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; for libel over articles written by Lewis-Smith from 1997 alleging that McKenna had deliberately misled the public with a fake PhD, having obtained the qualification from the non-accredited LaSalle University in the United States, whose principal had since been imprisoned for making misleading claims about the status of degrees he handed out to candidates. He later accepted damages of £25,000.

==Death==
On 12 December 2022, it was announced by Lewis-Smith&#x27;s public-relations agency that the author had died after a short illness, at the age of 65, in Bruges, Belgium, on 10 December 2022.

<doc id="179485" wikidata="Q1074209" url="?curid=179485" title="DMZ (computing)">
<text>In computer security, a DMZ or demilitarized zone (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network or screened subnet) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization&#x27;s external-facing services to an untrusted, usually larger, network such as the Internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an organization&#x27;s local area network (LAN): an external network node can access only what is exposed in the DMZ, while the rest of the organization&#x27;s network is protected behind a firewall. The DMZ functions as a small, isolated network positioned between the Internet and the private network.

This is not to be confused with a [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ host]], a feature present in some home routers that frequently differs greatly from an ordinary DMZ.

The name is from the term &quot;demilitarized zone&quot;, an area between states in which military operations are not permitted.

==Rationale==
The DMZ is seen as not belonging to either network bordering it. This metaphor applies to the computing use as the DMZ acts as a gateway to the public Internet. It is neither as secure as the internal network, nor as insecure as the public internet.

In this case, the hosts most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network, such as e-mail, Web and Domain Name System (DNS) servers. Because of the increased potential of these hosts suffering an attack, they are placed into this specific subnetwork in order to protect the rest of the network in case any of them become compromised.

Hosts in the DMZ are permitted to have only limited connectivity to specific hosts in the internal network, as the content of DMZ is not as secure as the internal network. Similarly, communication between hosts in the DMZ and to the external network is also restricted to make the DMZ more secure than the Internet and suitable for housing these special-purpose services. This allows hosts in the DMZ to communicate with both the internal and external network, while an intervening firewall controls the traffic between the DMZ servers and the internal network clients, and another firewall would perform some level of control to protect the DMZ from the external network.

A DMZ configuration provides additional security from external attacks, but it typically has no bearing on internal attacks such as sniffing communication via a packet analyzer or spoofing such as e-mail spoofing.

It is also sometimes good practice to configure a separate classified militarized zone (CMZ), a highly monitored militarized zone comprising mostly Web servers (and similar servers that interface to the external world i.e. the Internet) that are not in the DMZ but contain sensitive information about accessing servers within the LAN (like database servers). In such architecture, the DMZ usually has the application firewall and the FTP while the CMZ hosts the Web servers. (The database servers could be in the CMZ, in the LAN, or in a separate VLAN altogether.)

Any service that is being provided to users on the external network can be placed in the DMZ. The most common of these services are:
* Web servers
* Mail servers
* FTP servers
* VoIP servers

Web servers that communicate with an internal database require access to a database server, which may not be publicly accessible and may contain sensitive information. The web servers can communicate with database servers either directly or through an application firewall for security reasons.

E-mail messages and particularly the user database are confidential, so they are typically stored on servers that cannot be accessed from the Internet (at least not in an insecure manner), but can be accessed from email servers that are exposed to the Internet.

The mail server inside the DMZ passes incoming mail to the secured/internal mail servers. It also handles outgoing mail.

For security, compliance with legal standards such as HIPAA, and monitoring reasons, in a business environment, some enterprises install a proxy server within the DMZ. This has the following benefits:
* Obliges internal users (usually employees) to use the proxy server for Internet access.
* Reduced Internet access bandwidth requirements since some web content may be cached by the proxy server.
* Simplifies recording and monitoring of user activities.
* Centralized web content filtering.

A reverse proxy server, like a proxy server, is an intermediary but is used the other way around. Instead of providing a service to internal users wanting to access an external network, it provides indirect access for an external network (usually the Internet) to internal resources.
For example, a back office application access, such as an email system, could be provided to external users (to read emails while outside the company) but the remote user would not have direct access to their email server (only the reverse proxy server can physically access the internal email server). This is an extra layer of security particularly recommended when internal resources need to be accessed from the outside, but it&#x27;s worth noting this design still allows remote (and potentially malicious) users to talk to the internal resources with the help of the proxy. Since the proxy functions as a relay between the non-trusted network and the internal resource: it may also forward malicious traffic (e.g. application level exploits) towards the internal network; therefore the proxy&#x27;s attack detection and filtering capabilities are crucial in preventing external attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities present in the internal resources that are exposed via the proxy. Usually such a reverse proxy mechanism is provided by using an application layer firewall that focuses on the specific shape and contents of the traffic rather than just controlling access to specific TCP and UDP ports (as a packet filter firewall would do), but a reverse proxy is usually not a good substitute for a well thought out DMZ design as it has to rely on continuous signature updates for updated attack vectors.

==Architecture==
There are many different ways to design a network with a DMZ. Two of the most basic methods are with a single firewall, also known as the three-legged model, and with dual firewalls, also known as back to back. These architectures can be expanded to create very complex architectures depending on the network requirements.

===Single firewall===
A single firewall with at least 3 network interfaces can be used to create a network architecture containing a DMZ. The external network is formed from the ISP to the firewall on the first network interface, the internal network is formed from the second network interface, and the DMZ is formed from the third network interface. The firewall becomes a single point of failure for the network and must be able to handle all of the traffic going to the DMZ as well as the internal network.
The zones are usually marked with colors -for example, purple for LAN, green for DMZ, red for Internet (with often another color used for wireless zones).

===Dual firewall===
The most secure approach, according to Colton Fralick, is to use two firewalls to create a DMZ. The first firewall (also called the &quot;front-end&quot; or &quot;perimeter&quot; firewall) must be configured to allow traffic destined to the DMZ only. The second firewall (also called &quot;back-end&quot; or &quot;internal&quot; firewall) only allows traffic to the DMZ from the internal network.

This setup is considered more secure since two devices would need to be compromised. There is even more protection if the two firewalls are provided by two different vendors, because it makes it less likely that both devices suffer from the same security vulnerabilities. For example, a security hole found to exist in one vendor&#x27;s system is less likely to occur in the other one. One of the drawbacks of this architecture is that it&#x27;s more costly, both to purchase and to manage. The practice of using different firewalls from different vendors is sometimes described as a component of a &quot;defense in depth&quot; security strategy.

==DMZ host==

Some routers have a feature called DMZ host. This feature could designate one node (PC or other device with an IP address) as a DMZ host. The router&#x27;s firewall exposes all ports on the DMZ host to the external network and hinders no inbound traffic from the outside going to the DMZ host. This is a less secure alternative to port forwarding, which only exposes a handful of ports. This feature must be avoided, except when:

* The node designated as DMZ host is the downstream firewall of the actual DMZ (perhaps the router itself isn&#x27;t part of a home network)
* The node runs a powerful firewall capable of regulating internal security
* The sheer number of ports is too great for the port-forwarding feature
* Correct port forwarding rules could not be formulated in advance
* The router&#x27;s port forwarding is not capable of handling relevant traffic, e.g., 6in4 or GRE tunnels 

In all but the first scenario above, the DMZ host feature is used outside a true DMZ configuration.

<doc id="179488" wikidata="Q711779" url="?curid=179488" title="Rick Laird">
<text>Richard Quentin Laird (February 5, 1941 – July 4, 2021) was an Irish musician, best known as the bassist and a founding member of the jazz fusion band Mahavishnu Orchestra, with which he performed from 1971 to 1973.

==Early life==
Laird was born in Dublin on 5 February 1941 to a musical family. His mother played the piano in a variety of styles and his father played the ukulele; Laird started playing both instruments when he was three. At around five years of age, Laird started formal tuition in the guitar and piano, and he had already started to read sheet music. He soon quit the piano as he did not perform well, which led him to take up painting and drawing. At twelve, Laird began lessons in Spanish guitar, but his teacher used books that he felt were too difficult, so he quit. He then discovered jazz from his mother, who bought her son a pair of drum brushes and made him play along to records.

==Career==
===Early career===
At sixteen, Laird moved to New Zealand with his father and worked on a sheep farm. It was here where he took music seriously, first picking up an Australian Maton guitar, learning chords, and playing along to songs on the radio. After listening to an Oscar Peterson record featuring bassist Ray Brown, Laird noted Brown &quot;doing such incredible things&quot; and started to play bass lines on his guitar. He bought a string bass and played along to Brown&#x27;s records, and two weeks later he joined a local group in Auckland. It was here, at eighteen, where Laird &quot;quit his day job&quot; and became a professional bassist.

Laird&#x27;s first band soon split, but he joined another which featured pianist Mike Nock and toured New Zealand extensively. When Laird was nineteen, he moved to Sydney, Australia for two years, where there was a more active jazz scene. Here, he played with many top jazz musicians including Don Burrows, and performed in jazz quartets on the radio. Around this time, Laird&#x27;s goal was to relocate to the US, but he was encouraged to relocate to England in 1962.

While in England, Laird toured with the vocal ensemble Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross, which led to a stint with Zoot Sims and saxophonist Al Cohn, followed by session work. From 1963 to 1964, Laird studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and played in The Brian Auger Trinity (July 1963–February 1964) and The Brian Auger Group (February–October 1964), the latter of which featured guitarist John McLaughlin. Laird clashed with Auger when he was asked to switch from upright to electric bass to complement the music they were playing, but Laird refused. Laird then accepted the offer to become house bassist at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club, playing with many visiting musicians including Wes Montgomery and Sonny Stitt. It became a valuable learning experience for Laird, as the group were given considerable freedom and Laird received constructive and helpful advice from the other musicians. Laird is featured on the soundtrack of &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966) with Sonny Rollins. With Buddy Rich, he played a residence at The Talk of the Town in 1969.

===Move to the United States and Mahavishnu Orchestra===
In 1966, Laird won a scholarship to study at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts after sending a tape of himself playing with Stan Getz. Here, Laird studied arranging, composition, and the string bass. In 1968, he took up the bass guitar &quot;so I could be heard.&quot; He gained confidence to take up the instrument after seeing The Tony Williams Lifetime in concert.
Laird was a founding member and electric bassist of the jazz fusion band Mahavishnu Orchestra, the original line-up of which were active from June 1971 to December 1973. &quot;Guitar Player&quot; described Laird&#x27;s playing: &quot;Laird&#x27;s solid, economical lines in conjunction with Billy Cobham&#x27;s meticulous, powerful drumming provided a strong anchor for the odd-tempo and often volatile solos [from the rest of the band]&quot;. After the band split, Laird moved to New York City and played with Stan Getz (a tour in 1977) and Chick Corea (a tour the following year). Laird put out one album as a leader, &quot;Soft Focus&quot;.

===Later career===
Laird retired as a performing musician in 1982. He became a successful photographer and bass teacher. He authored two intermediate- to advanced-level bass books. In 1999, Laird had started to compose on his daughter&#x27;s iMac computer. He said: &quot;I have no agenda. It&#x27;s just for my own enjoyment. Besides, I&#x27;ve come to realise our main gig on this planet is not what we do for a living – it&#x27;s to find out who we are, and to learn how to love ourselves and love others.&quot; Laird was one of a handful of musicians to play an S. D. Curlee, which was his principal fretted bass.

In March 2009, Laird discovered a collection of photographs that he had taken of musical artists, including Miles Davis, Chick Corea, Wayne Shorter, the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Elvin Jones, Keith Jarrett and many others. Much of his collection was posted online.

==Death==
In early 2021, Laird&#x27;s daughter announced that he had entered hospice care. Laird died of lung cancer in New City, Rockland County, New York on 4 July 2021, aged 80.

<doc id="179491" wikidata="Q3282147" url="?curid=179491" title="Junk food news">
<text>Junk food news is a sardonic term for news stories that deliver &quot;sensationalized, personalized, and homogenized inconsequential trivia&quot;,
especially when such stories appear at the expense of serious investigative journalism. It implies a criticism of the mass media for disseminating news that, while not very nourishing, is &quot;cheap to produce and profitable for media proprietors.&quot;

==Meaning==
The term &quot;junk food news&quot; was first used in print by Carl Jensen in the March 1983 edition of &quot;Penthouse.&quot; As the leader of Project Censored, he had frequently faulted the media for ignoring important stories. In response, says Jensen, editors claimed that other stories were more important, and bolstered this claim with ad hominem comments directed against him.
...news editors and directors...argued that the real issue isn&#x27;t censorship—but rather a difference of opinion as to what information is important to publish or broadcast. Editors often point out that there is a finite amount of time and space for news delivery—about 23 minutes for a half-hour network television evening news program—and that it&#x27;s their responsibility to determine which stories are most critical for the public to hear. The critics said I wasn&#x27;t exploring media censorship but rather I was just another frustrated academic criticizing editorial news judgment.

To give this argument a fair hearing, Jensen decided to conduct a review to determine which stories the media had considered more important. But instead of hard-hitting investigative journalism, what he discovered was the phenomenon that he termed junk food news fell into predictable categories:

* Brand name news (celebrity gossip)
* Sex news (exposés and sexual titillation)
* Yo-yo news (statistics that change daily, such as stock market numbers and box office totals)
* Show business news (movie openings)
* Latest craze news (brief fads)
* Anniversary news (anniversaries of major events or celebrity deaths)
* Sports news (sports rumours)
* Political news (bi-annual coverage of congressional campaign promises)

As the flip side to its annual list of the Top 25 Censored Stories, Project Censored publishes an annual list of the Top 10 Junk Food News stories, compiled by members of the National Organization of News Ombudsmen.

<text>Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers (; ; 11 October 1758 – 2 March 1840) was a German astronomer. He found a convenient method of calculating the orbit of comets, and in 1802 and 1807, discovered the second and the fourth asteroids Pallas and Vesta.

==Life and career==
Olbers was born in Arbergen, Germany, today part of Bremen, and studied to be a physician at Göttingen (1777–80). While he was at Göttingen, he studied mathematics with Abraham Gotthelf Kästner. In 1779, while attending to a sick fellow student, he devised a method of calculating cometary orbits which made an epoch in the treatment of the subject, as it was the first satisfactory method of calculating cometary orbits. After his graduation in 1780, he began practicing medicine in Bremen. At night he dedicated his time to astronomical observation, making the upper story of his home into an observatory.

In 1800, Olbers was one of 24 astronomers invited to participate in the group known as the &quot;celestial police&quot;, dedicated to finding new planets in the solar system. On 28 March 1802, Olbers discovered and named the asteroid Pallas. Five years later, on 29 March 1807, he discovered the asteroid Vesta, which he allowed Carl Friedrich Gauss to name. As the word &quot;asteroid&quot; was not yet coined, the literature of the time referred to these minor planets as planets in their own right. He proposed that the asteroid belt, where these objects lay, was the remnants of a planet that had been destroyed. The current view of most scientists is that tidal effects from the planet Jupiter disrupted the planet-formation process in the asteroid belt. On 6 March 1815, Olbers discovered a periodic comet, now named after him (formally designated 13P/Olbers). Olbers&#x27; paradox, described by him in 1823 (and then reformulated in 1826), states that the darkness of the night sky conflicts with the supposition of an infinite and eternal static universe.

In July 1804, the young Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel contacted Olbers to get his opinion of Bessel&#x27;s treatise on orbit calculation of Halley&#x27;s Comet. Olbers noticed the outstanding quality of this work and arranged for its publication.

In 1804, Olbers was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, in 1809, corresponding member living abroad of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1822, a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1827, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Olbers was deputed by his fellow citizens to assist at the baptism of Napoleon II of France on 9 June 1811. He was a member of the &quot;corps legislatif&quot; in Paris 1812–13. He died in Bremen aged 81. He was twice married, and one son survived him. Olbers&#x27; paradox, the argument that the dark sky at night shows that stars cannot be evenly distributed through infinite space, is named for him, though others had also advanced it.

== Honors ==
The following celestial features are named for Olbers:
* The periodic comet 13P/Olbers
* The minor planet 1002 Olbersia
* The lunar crater &quot;Olbers&quot;
* The albedo feature &quot;Olbers&quot; on Vesta&#x27;s surface

There is a statue of Olbers of 1850 in the former rampart area in Bremen.

<text>Public property is property that is dedicated to public use. The term may be used either to describe the use to which the property is put, or to describe the character of its ownership (owned collectively by the population of a state). State ownership, also called public ownership, government ownership or state property, are property interests that are vested in the state, rather than an individual or communities.

== Differences from private property ==
American economist Armen A. Alchian explored what distinguishes public property from private property, concluding that a unique difference lies in the limitations put on its alienability. That is, a crucial feature of public property lies in the inability of their owners to sell or grant them to others. According to Alchian, private property is that which can be transferred at the discretion of its owners, whilst public property is that which cannot.

Consequently, because of the absence of exchange in much of what is public property and thereby the absence of market prices reflecting its value, it is difficult for a government to appraise its holdings. This can lead to problems with economic calculation.

Both rights with respect to public and private property are in part determined by governments. The owner of a private property can control it at own discretion, whilst the state reserves the right to charge taxes and nationalize it, or temporarily use it. The difference between public and private property lies in their alienability.

Most public property is government-provided and not charged for separately to users, but open to the public. However, it is incorrect to say that all public property can be used freely by the public. Many public goods are provided only to subsets of the population, such as care for the elderly and playgrounds for children. That is, the &#x27;public&#x27; may vary and does not in fact determine its public or private nature.

== In Marxism ==
Karl Marx described private property as a fundamental social relation of bourgeois society, where it is used for appropriation of labor by capitalists. Marx considered that public property will replace the private property, as a natural historical change of a property relationship.
All property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions.

The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favour of bourgeois property.

The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.

– Marx &amp; Engels: Library: 1848: &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;: Chapter 2

Generally, in Marxism, private property is understood as property that is used by bourgeoisie to increase capital.

== Crown property ==
In the modern representative democracy, &quot;public property&quot; is said to be owned by the people as a commons or held in trust by the government for common benefit. In many Commonwealth realms, such property is said to be owned by the Crown. Examples include Crown land, Crown copyright, and Crown Dependencies.

==Examples==

=== USSR ===
According to the 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union:
State property, i. e. the common property of the Soviet people, is the principal form of socialist property.

The land, its minerals, waters, and forests are the exclusive property of the state. The state owns the basic means of production in industry, construction, and agriculture; means of transport and communication; the banks; the property of state-run trade organisations and public utilities, and other state-run undertakings; most urban housing; and other property necessary for state purposes.

– Article 11
But &quot;public property&quot; itself as a separate form was not foreseen, instead there was social ownership of the means of production.

=== United States ===
In Alaska since the 1950s was working off the model of public property in the resource sector. There was almost one third of the state with huge reserves of oil. For the realization of the right onto the public property in 1976 was founded Alaska Permanent Fund, which included 25% of the annual fee of the incomes of private oil-producing companies.

That fund is the public property of the state population.What is expressed in payment of dividends to all citizens(except convicted criminals). The average value of the dividends is between $600 and $1500, for the 2020 it was $992.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the &quot;Public Debt and Property&quot; are under the exclusive legislative authority of the parliament of Canada, rather than the Queen or the local authority, according to the Constitution Acts, 1867 and 1982, article 91.

=== Common land ===
Common land was in a public usage of a village community for cattle breeding, growing cereals, fishing. Forest lands were used for timber extraction.

<doc id="179500" wikidata="Q1407305" url="?curid=179500" title="Coors Brewing Company">
<text>The Coors Brewing Company is an American brewery and beer company based in Golden, Colorado, that was founded in 1873. In 2005, Adolph Coors Company, the holding company that owned Coors Brewing, merged with Molson, Inc. to become Molson Coors. The first Coors brewery location in Golden, Colorado is the largest single brewing facility operating in the world.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
In 1873, German immigrants Adolph Coors and Jacob Schueler from Prussia immigrated to the United States and established a brewery in Golden, Colorado, after buying a recipe for a Pilsner-style beer from a Czech immigrant William Silhan. Coors invested $2,000 in the operation, and Schueler invested $18,000. In 1880, Coors bought out his partner and became the sole owner of the brewery.

=== Prohibition ===
The Coors Brewing Company managed to survive Prohibition relatively intact. Years before the Volstead Act went into effect nationwide, Adolph Coors established the Adolph Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company, which included Herold Porcelain and other ventures, with sons Adolph Jr., Grover and Herman. The brewery itself was converted into a malted milk and near beer production facility. Coors sold much of the malted milk to the Mars candy company to produce sweets. Manna, the company&#x27;s non-alcoholic beer replacement, was a near-beer similar to current non-alcoholic beverages. However, Coors and his sons relied heavily on the porcelain company and a cement and real estate company to keep the Coors Brewing Company afloat. By 1933, after the end of Prohibition, the Coors brewery was one of only a handful of breweries that had survived.

All of the non-brewery assets of the Adolph Coors Company were spun off between 1989 and 1992. The descendant of the original Herold Porcelain ceramics business continues to operate as CoorsTek.

=== Products ===
For much of its first 100 years of existence, Coors beer was marketed solely in the American West. While California and Texas were part of the 11-state distribution area, Washington and Montana were not added until 1976 (Oregon did not approve sales in grocery stores until 1985). This gave it mystique and made it a novelty, particularly on the East Coast, and visitors returning from the western states often brought back a case. This iconic status was reflected in the 1977 film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;. The company finally established nationwide distribution in the United States in 1986. 

In 1959, Coors became the first American brewer to use an all-aluminum two-piece beverage can. Also in 1959, the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer. Coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world, known as the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), in Golden. RMMC is a joint venture between Ball Metal and Coors, having been founded in 2003.

In the mid-1970s, Coors invented the litter-free push tab can, in place of the ring pull-tab. However, consumers disliked the top and it was discontinued soon afterward.

Coors Light was introduced in 1978. The longtime slogan of &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; to describe it does not describe the beer, but rather the silver-colored can in which Coors packaged the beer. Coors once produced Coors Light in &quot;yellow-bellied&quot; cans like the full-strength Coors. However, when the yellow coloring was removed, the can was left mostly silver.

=== Mergers ===
On July 22, 2004, the Adolph Coors Company, the holding company that owned Coors Brewing, announced it would be merging with Canadian brewing company Molson, Inc. The merger was completed February 9, 2005, with the merged company being named Molson Coors Brewing Company. Coors Brewing Company became a subsidiary of the new company. Due to the merger, Molson Coors was rated the third largest producer of beer in the United States, and the second largest brewer in the United Kingdom.

==Brands==
Coors is responsible for promoting and distributing several alcoholic beverage brands. The most notable of those brands are Coors Banquet, Coors Light, Blue Moon, Keystone, and Miller.

== Controversies ==
=== Labor problems ===
In April 1977, the brewery workers union at Coors, representing 1,472 employees, went on strike. The brewery kept operating with supervisors and 250 to 300 union members, including one union executive board member who ignored the strike. Soon after, Coors announced that it would hire replacements for the striking workers. About 700 workers quit the picket line to go back to work, and Coors replaced the remaining 500 workers, keeping the beer production process uninterrupted. In December 1978, the workers at Coors voted by greater than a two-to-one ratio to decertify the union, ending 44 years of union representation at Coors. Because the strike was more than a year old, striking workers could not vote in the election.

Labor unions organized a boycott to punish Coors for its labor practices. One tactic employed by the unions was a push for states to pass laws banning the sale of unpasteurized canned and bottled beer. Because Coors was the only major brewer at the time not pasteurizing its canned and bottled beer, such laws would hurt only Coors. Sales of Coors suffered during the decade-long labor union boycott. However, Coors claimed that declining sales were also due to an industry-wide downturn in beer sales and increased competition. To maintain production, Coors expanded its sales area from the 18 western states to which it had marketed for years to nationwide distribution. This was completed in 1991, with Indiana being the last state for the brand to appear.

The AFL–CIO ended its boycott of Coors in August 1987, after negotiations with Pete Coors, head of brewery operations. The settlement details were not divulged but were said to include an early union representation election in Colorado and the use of union workers to build the new Coors brewery in Virginia.

In 1988, the Teamsters Union, which represented brewery workers at the top three U.S. beer makers at the time (Anheuser-Busch, Miller, and Stroh), gained enough signatures to trigger a union representation election inside the Coors company. Coors workers again rejected union representation by more than a two-to-one ratio.

=== Minority issues ===
Mexican Americans charged Coors with discriminatory hiring practices following the passage of the Civil Rights Act. They launched a boycott of the company&#x27;s products beginning in the late 1960s. Labor unions and gay rights activists joined the boycott, which lasted into the 1980s.

A federal lawsuit in 1975 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ended in a settlement with Coors agreeing not to discriminate against blacks, Hispanics, and women. In 1977, Coors was accused of firing gay and lesbian employees. From the late 1970s, Coors agreed not to discriminate against homosexuals; the first major brewery in the United States to make such a commitment.

Coors encouraged the organization of its gay and lesbian employees into the Lesbian and Gay Employee Resource (LAGER) in 1993. In May 1995, Coors became the 21st publicly traded corporation in the United States to extend employee benefits to same-sex partners. When company chairman Pete Coors was criticized for the company&#x27;s gay-friendly policy during his 2004 Republican primary campaign for a United States Senate seat from Colorado, he defended the policy as a basic good business practice. 

== In popular culture ==
The 1977 film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; centers on an illegal shipment of Coors from Texas to Georgia.

In 2014, Coors (as MillerCoors) entered a contract with FX Networks, the producer of TV shows such as &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;. Since season six of the show all beer in Paddy&#x27;s Pub is Coors and the bar has Coors signs and logos scattered throughout it.

<text>Ralph David Abernathy Sr. (; March 11, 1926 – April 17, 1990) was an American civil rights activist and Baptist minister. He was ordained in the Baptist tradition in 1948. Being the leader of the civil rights movement, he was a close friend and mentor of Martin Luther King Jr. He collaborated with King and E. D. Nixon to create the Montgomery Improvement Association, which led to the Montgomery bus boycott and co-created and was an executive board member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). He became president of the SCLC following the assassination of King in 1968; he led the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign in Washington, D.C., as well as other marches and demonstrations for disenfranchised Americans. He also served as an advisory committee member of the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE).

In 1971, Abernathy addressed the United Nations, speaking about world peace. He also assisted in brokering a deal between the FBI and American Indian Movement protestors during the Wounded Knee incident of 1973. He retired from his position as president of the SCLC in 1977 and became president emeritus. Later that year, he unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives for the 5th district of Georgia. He later founded the Foundation for Economic Enterprises Development, and he testified before the U.S. Congress in support of extending the Voting Rights Act in 1982.

In 1989, Abernathy wrote &quot;And the Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot;, a controversial autobiography about his and King&#x27;s involvement in the civil rights movement. Abernathy eventually became less active in politics and returned to his work as a minister. He died of heart disease on April 17, 1990. His tombstone is engraved with the words &quot;I tried.&quot;

==Early life, family, and education==
Abernathy, the 10th of William L. and Louivery Valentine Abernathy ( Bell)&#x27;s 12 children, was born on March 11, 1926, on their family farm in Linden, Alabama. Abernathy&#x27;s father was the first African-American to vote in Marengo County, Alabama, and the first to serve on a grand jury there. Abernathy attended Linden Academy (a Baptist school founded by the First Mt. Pleasant District Association). At Linden Academy, Abernathy led his first demonstrations to improve the livelihoods of his fellow students.

During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army advancing in rank becoming platoon sergeant before being discharged. Afterwards he enrolled at Alabama State University using the benefits from the G.I. Bill, which he earned with his service. As a sophomore, he was elected president of the student council, and led a successful hunger strike to raise the quality of the food served on the campus. While still a college student, Abernathy announced his call to the ministry, which he had envisioned since he was a small boy growing up in a devout Baptist family. He was ordained a Baptist minister in 1948 and preached his first sermon on Mother&#x27;s Day (in honor of his recently deceased mother). In 1950 he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics. During the summer of 1950 Abernathy hosted a radio show and became the first black disc jockey on a white radio station in Montgomery, Alabama. In the fall, he went to Atlanta University earning a Master of Arts degree in sociology with high honors in 1951. While enrolled at Alabama State, Abernathy pledged becoming an initiated brother of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

He began his professional career in 1951, when he was appointed as the dean of men at Alabama State University. Later in the same year, he became the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church, the largest black church in Montgomery; he held the position for ten years.

He married Juanita Odessa Jones of Uniontown, Alabama, on August 31, 1952. Together they had five children: Ralph David Abernathy Jr., Juandalynn Ralpheda, Donzaleigh Avis, Ralph David Abernathy III, and Kwame Luthuli Abernathy. Their first child, Ralph Abernathy Jr., died suddenly on August 18, 1953, less than two days after his birth on August 16, while their other children lived on to adulthood. His grandson, Micah Abernathy, is currently an American football player for the Atlanta Falcons.

In 1954, Abernathy met Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whoat the timewas just becoming a pastor himself at a nearby church. Abernathy mentored King and the two men eventually became close friends.

==Civil rights activism==
===Montgomery bus boycott===
After the arrest of Rosa Parks on December 1, 1955, for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white man, Abernathy, then a member of the Montgomery NAACP, collaborated with King to create the Montgomery Improvement Association, which organized the Montgomery bus boycott. Along with fellow English professor Jo Ann Robinson, they called for and distributed flyers asking the black citizens of Montgomery to stay off the buses. The boycott attracted national attention, and a federal court case that ended on December 17, 1956, when the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot;, upheld an earlier District Court decision that the bus segregation was unconstitutional. The 381-day transit boycott, challenging the &quot;Jim Crow&quot; segregation laws, had been successful. And on December 20, 1956, the boycott came to an end.

After the boycotts, Abernathy&#x27;s home and church were bombed. His family were barely able to escape their home, but they were unharmed. Abernathy&#x27;s church, Mt. Olive Church, Bell Street Church, and the home of Robert Graetz were also bombed on that evening, while King, Abernathy, and 58 other black leaders from the south were meeting at the Southern Negro Leaders Conference on Transportation and Nonviolent Integration, in Atlanta.

===Southern Christian Leadership Conference and support of Freedom Riders===
On January 11, 1957, after a two-day-long meeting, the Southern Leaders Conference on Transportation and Non-violent Integration was founded. On February 14, 1957, the conference convened again in New Orleans. During that meeting, they changed the group&#x27;s name to the Southern Leadership Conference and appointed the following executive board: King, president; Charles Kenzie Steele, vice president; Abernathy, financial secretary-treasurer; T. J. Jemison, secretary; I. M. Augustine, general counsel. On August 8, 1957, the Southern Leadership Conference held its first convention, in Montgomery. They changed the conference&#x27;s name a final time to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and decided to start voter registration drives for black people across the south.

On May 20, 1961, the Freedom Riders stopped in Montgomery while on their way from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans to protest the still segregated buses across the south. Many of the Freedom Riders were beaten by a white mob once they arrived at the Montgomery bus station, causing several of the riders to be hospitalized. The following night Abernathy and King set up an event in support of the Freedom Riders, where King would make an address, at Abernathy&#x27;s church. More than 1,500 people came to the event that night. The church was soon surrounded by a mob of white segregationists who laid siege on the church. King, from inside the church, called the Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and pleaded for help from the federal government. There was a group of United States Marshals sent there to protect the event, but they were too few in number to protect the church from the angry mob, who had begun throwing rocks and bricks through the windows of the church. Reinforcements with riot experience, from the Marshals service, were sent in to help defend the perimeter. By the next morning, the Governor of Alabama, after being called by Kennedy, sent in the Alabama National Guard, and the mob was finally dispersed. After the success of the Freedom Riders in Montgomery, Birmingham, and Huntsville, Alabama in 1961, King insisted that Abernathy assume the pastorate of the West Hunter Street Baptist Church in Atlanta; Abernathy moved his family from Montgomery becoming the pastor in 1962.

The King/Abernathy partnership spearheaded successful nonviolent movements in Montgomery; Albany, Georgia; Birmingham, Mississippi, Washington D.C., Selma, Alabama; St. Augustine, Florida; Chicago, and Memphis. King and Abernathy journeyed together, often sharing the same hotel rooms, and leisure times with their wives, children, family, and friends. And they were both jailed 17 times together, for their involvement in the movement.

===During Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s assassination===

On April 3, 1968, at the Mason Temple, Abernathy introduced King before he made his last public address; King said at the beginning of his now famous &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to the Mountaintop&quot; speech:

As I listened to Ralph Abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself, I wondered who he was talking about. It&#x27;s always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you, and Ralph Abernathy is the best friend that I have in the world.
The following day, April 4, 1968, Abernathy was with King in the room (Room 306) they shared at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. At 6:01 p.m. while Abernathy was inside the room getting cologne, King was shot while standing outside on the balcony. Once the shot was fired Abernathy ran out to the balcony and cradled King in his arms as he lay unconscious. Abernathy accompanied King to St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital within fifteen minutes of the shooting. The doctors performed an emergency surgery, but he never regained consciousness. King was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. at age 39.

==Leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference==
Until King&#x27;s assassination, Abernathy had served as Southern Christian Leadership Conference&#x27;s first Financial Secretary/Treasurer and Vice President At-Large. After King&#x27;s death, Abernathy assumed the presidency of the SCLC. One of his first roles was to take up the role of leading a march to support striking sanitation workers in Memphis which King and Abernathy had planned to attend before King&#x27;s assassination. In May 1968, Abernathy led the Poor People&#x27;s Campaign in Washington, D.C.

===Protest at NASA===
On the eve of the launch of Apollo 11, on July 15, 1969, Abernathy arrived at Cape Kennedy with several hundred members of the poor people campaign to protest against the spending by government on space exploration, while many Americans remained poor. He was met by Thomas O. Paine, the administrator of NASA, whom he told that in the face of such suffering, space flight represented an inhuman priority and funds should be spent instead to &quot;feed the hungry, clothe the naked, tend the sick, and house the homeless&quot;. Paine told Abernathy that the advances in space exploration were &quot;child&#x27;s play&quot; compared to the &quot;tremendously difficult human problems&quot; of society Abernathy was discussing. Despite protesting against the launch, Abernathy acknowledged that he was &quot;profoundly moved by the nation&#x27;s achievements in space and the heroism of the three men embarking for the moon&quot;, but added that &quot;What we can do for space and exploration we demand that we do for starving people.&quot; Later in 1969 Abernathy also took part in a labor struggle in Charleston, South Carolina, on behalf of the hospital workers of the local union 1199B, which led to a living wage increase and improved working conditions for thousands of hospital workers.

===Wounded Knee===
In 1973, Abernathy helped negotiate a peace settlement at the Wounded Knee uprising between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the leaders of the American Indian Movement, Russell Means and Dennis Banks.

Abernathy remained president of the SCLC for nine years following King&#x27;s death in 1968. After King&#x27;s death the organization lost the popularity it had under his leadership. By the time Abernathy left the organization the SCLC had become indebted, and critics stated that it wasn&#x27;t as imaginative as the SCLC led by Dr. King. In 1977 Abernathy resigned from his leadership role at the SCLC, and was bestowed the title president emeritus.

==Political career and later activism==
Abernathy addressed the United Nations in 1971; he spoke about world peace. He was also a member of the board of directors of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. In 1977, he ran unsuccessfully for Georgia&#x27;s 5th Congressional District seat, losing to Congressman Wyche Fowler. He founded the nonprofit organization Foundation for Economic Enterprises Development (FEED), which offered managerial and technical training, creating jobs, income, business and trade opportunities for underemployed and unemployed workers for underprivileged blacks.

In 1979, Abernathy endorsed Senator Edward M. Kennedy&#x27;s candidacy for the Presidency of the United States. However, he shocked critics a few weeks before the 1980 November election, when he endorsed the front-runner, Ronald Reagan, over the struggling presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter. Abernathy stated of his endorsement: &quot;The Republican Party has too long ignored us and the Democratic Party has taken us for granted and so since all of my colleagues and the latter in various places across the country were supporting the Democratic Party, I felt that I should support Ronald Reagan.&quot; Abernathy withdrew his endorsement of Reagan in 1984, citing his disappointment with the Reagan Administration on civil rights and other areas.

In 1982, Abernathy testified—along with his executive associate, James Peterson of Berkeley, California—before the Congressional Hearings calling for the Extension of the Voting Rights Act.
Documents declassified in 2017 show that Abernathy was on the National Security Agency watchlist because of FBI leadership&#x27;s hatred of the civil rights movement.

===&quot;And the Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot;===
In late 1989, HarperCollins published Abernathy&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;And the Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot;. It was his final published accounting of his close partnership with King and their work in the civil rights movement. In it he revealed King&#x27;s marital infidelity, stating that King had sexual relations with two women on the night of April 3, 1968 (after his &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to the Mountaintop&quot; speech earlier that day). The book&#x27;s revelations became the source of much controversy, as did Abernathy. Jesse Jackson and other civil rights activists made a statement in October 1989—after the book&#x27;s release—that the book was &quot;slander&quot; and that &quot;brain surgery&quot; must have altered Abernathy&#x27;s perception.

===Unification Church===
In the 1980s, the Unification Church hired Abernathy as a spokesperson to protest the news media&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Moonies&quot;, which they compared with the word &quot;nigger&quot;. Abernathy also served as vice president of the Unification Church-affiliated group American Freedom Coalition, and served on two Unification Church boards of directors.

==Death==
Abernathy died at Emory Crawford Long Memorial Hospital on the morning of April 17, 1990, from two blood clots that traveled to his heart and lungs, at the age of 64. After his death George H. W. Bush, then-President of the United States issued the following statement:

Barbara and I join with all Americans to mourn the passing of the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, a great leader in the struggle for civil rights for all Americans and a tireless campaigner for justice.
He is entombed in the Chapel Mausoleum of Lincoln Cemetery in Atlanta. At Abernathy&#x27;s behest, his tomb has the simple inscription: &quot;I TRIED.&quot;

==Tributes and portrayals==
During his lifetime Abernathy was honored with more than 300 awards and citations, including five honorary doctoral degrees. He received a Doctor of Divinity from Morehouse College, a Doctor of Divinity from Kalamazoo College in Michigan, a Doctor of Laws from Allen University of South Carolina, a Doctor of Laws from Long Island University in New York, and a Doctor of Laws from Alabama State University.

*Ralph D. Abernathy Hall at Alabama State Hall is dedicated to him, with a bust of his head in the foyer area.
*Interstate 20 Ralph David Abernathy Freeway, Abernathy Road, and Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard of Atlanta were named in his honor.

Abernathy was portrayed by Ernie Lee Banks in the 1978 miniseries &quot;King&quot;. He was also portrayed by Terrence Howard in the 2001 HBO film &quot;Boycott&quot;, Colman Domingo in the 2014 film &quot;Selma&quot;, and Dohn Norwood in the 2016 film &quot;All the Way&quot;. Hubert Point-Du Jour also portrayed Abernathy in &quot;Genius&quot;.

<text>Jean Lorrain (9 August 1855 in Fécamp, Seine-Maritime – 30 June 1906), born Paul Alexandre Martin Duval, was a French poet and novelist of the Symbolist school.

Lorrain was a dedicated disciple of dandyism and spent much of his time amongst the fashionable artistic circles in France, particularly in the cafés and bars of Montmartre.

He contributed to the satirical weekly &quot;Le Courrier français&quot;, and wrote a number of collections of verse, including &quot;La forêt bleue&quot; (1883) and &quot;L&#x27;ombre ardente&quot; (1897). He is also remembered for his Decadent novels and short stories, such as &quot;Monsieur de Phocas&quot; (1901), &quot;Monsieur de Bougrelon&quot; (1897), and &quot;Histoires des masques&quot; (1900), as well as for one of his best stories, &quot;Sonyeuse&quot;, which he linked to portraits exhibited by Antonio de La Gándara in 1893. He also wrote the libretto to Pierre de Bréville&#x27;s opera &quot;Éros vainqueur&quot; (1910).

Manuel Orazi illustrated his novella &quot;Ma petite ville&quot; in 1989.

Lorrain was openly gay, often citing ancient Greece as noble heritage for homosexuality, and became colloquially known as &quot;The Ambassador from Sodom&quot;.

Due to tubercular symptoms, he started using morphine, and then moved on to drinking ether, a habit he shared with Guy de Maupassant. Under the influence of ether Lorrain wrote several horror stories, but eventually the substance gave him stomach ulcers and health problems.

<doc id="179505" wikidata="Q4373292" url="?curid=179505" title="Physical property">
<text>A physical property is any property of a physical system that is measurable. The changes in the physical properties of a system can be used to describe its changes between momentary states. A quantifiable physical property is called &quot;physical quantity&quot;. Measurable physical quantities are often referred to as &quot;observables&quot;. 
Some physical properties are qualitative, such as shininess, brittleness, etc.; some general qualitative properties admit more specific related quantitative properties, such as in opacity, hardness, ductility, viscosity, etc.

Physical properties are often characterized as intensive and extensive properties. An intensive property does not depend on the size or extent of the system, nor on the amount of matter in the object, while an extensive property shows an additive relationship. These 
classifications are in general only valid in cases when smaller subdivisions of the sample do not interact in some physical or chemical process when combined.

Properties may also be classified with respect to the directionality of their nature. For example, isotropic properties do not change with the direction of observation, and anisotropic properties do have spatial variance.

It may be difficult to determine whether a given property is a material property or not. Color, for example, can be seen and measured; however, what one perceives as color is really an interpretation of the reflective properties of a surface and the light used to illuminate it. In this sense, many ostensibly physical properties are called supervenient. A supervenient property is one which is actual, but is secondary to some underlying reality. This is similar to the way in which objects are supervenient on atomic structure. A cup might have the physical properties of mass, shape, color, temperature, etc., but these properties are supervenient on the underlying atomic structure, which may in turn be supervenient on an underlying quantum structure.

Physical properties are contrasted with chemical properties which determine the way a material behaves in a chemical reaction.

==List of properties==

<doc id="179506" wikidata="Q747723" url="?curid=179506" title="Bob Denver">
<text>Robert Osbourne Denver (January 9, 1935 – September 2, 2005) was an American comedic actor who portrayed beatnik Maynard G. Krebs on the 1959–1963 series &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; and Gilligan on the 1964–1967 television series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

==Early life==
Denver was born on January 9, 1935, in New Rochelle, New York, and raised in Brownwood, Texas. He graduated in 1953 from David Starr Jordan High School in Long Beach, California. He graduated from Loyola University in Los Angeles, California, with a degree in political science. He acted in college productions at Loyola and met fellow student Dwayne Hickman, with whom he later co-starred in &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;. After graduation, he coached physical education and taught mathematics and history at Corpus Christi School, a Catholic elementary school in Pacific Palisades, California.

==Career==
Most of Denver&#x27;s acting career was in television, though he also appeared in several films and on Broadway. He was widely associated with the title character that he played in the 1960s television series &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, and he continued to appear as Gilligan in several movies, as a guest on other television series, in personal appearances, and as a voice actor in the animated version of the series.

===Television career===
Denver made his television debut in 1957, playing a small part in an episode of &quot;The Silent Service&quot; (S01 E37: &quot;The Loss of the Tang&quot;). While teaching at Corpus Christi in 1958, Denver was permitted to audition for a role on the sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; as a favor to his sister, who was a secretary on the production lot. He gained the role and left teaching the following year to become a regular on the series. From 1959 to 1963, he appeared on the series as Maynard G. Krebs, the teenaged beatnik best friend of Dobie Gillis, played by Dwayne Hickman. After filming the first three episodes, Denver received his draft notice, and was briefly written out of the script and replaced, but he was designated 4-F due to an old neck injury and returned to &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; having missed only one episode. Denver later reprised his Maynard G. Krebs role in the television sequels &quot;Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?&quot; (1977) and &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1988).

During his time on &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;, Denver appeared on the NBC interview program, &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;. In 1963, Denver played his only major dramatic role on television, as a physician (Dr. Paul Garrett) in one episode of &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, telecast on October 10, 1963; the episode, &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Believe the Truth ...&quot;, also featured Barbara Eden and Ken Berry. Between the end of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; and the beginning of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, Denver appeared in an episode of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and in the final episode of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;. He also had a one-episode role replacing the actor who played Dudley A. &quot;Dud&quot; Wash, the fiancé of Charlene Darling of the Darlings, on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; which was aired March 30, 1964. This was done by the network to promote Denver&#x27;s face and make him more familiar to the viewing audience since &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; was about to go on air.

Following the cancellation of &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;, Denver landed the title role on the sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, which ran for three seasons (1964–67) on CBS, and became a staple of later syndication. His role as the well-meaning but bumbling first mate among a small group of shipwrecked castaways became the one for which he is most remembered. During the run, Denver privately went out of his way to help his co-stars who warmly appreciated his efforts, such as successfully demanding that Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells be included in the series&#x27; opening credits (which also included a nod to their respective characters in the opening theme song), and insisting that Wells get an equal share of the series&#x27; publicity with Tina Louise. A decade after the series was canceled, Denver played Gilligan in the made-for-TV reunion movies &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1978), &quot;The Castaways on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1981). He also lent his voice to the animated series &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; and its sequel &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot;. During the 1980s and 1992, he reprised the character of Gilligan for numerous cameo appearances, including episodes of &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Meego&quot; and &quot;Baywatch&quot;, and played a bartender in the film &quot;Back to the Beach&quot; (1987).

After &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, Denver went on to star on other TV comedy series, including &quot;The Good Guys&quot; (1968–1970), &quot;Dusty&#x27;s Trail&quot; (1973–1974) (a show similar to &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, involving a lost wagon train headed to California), and the Sid and Marty Krofft children&#x27;s program &quot;Far Out Space Nuts&quot; (1975). Four episodes of &quot;Dusty&#x27;s Trail&quot; were later combined to create a feature film, &quot;The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West&quot; (1976).

Denver&#x27;s other television roles included guest appearances on multiple episodes of &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;The Love Boat&quot;; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. In 1983, he starred in the television pilot &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; as the bumbling mad scientist uncle of the title character.

===Film career===
Denver&#x27;s first feature film appearance was in the service farce, &quot;A Private&#x27;s Affair&quot; (1959), with Sal Mineo. Credited as Robert Denver, he had a small role in the Jimmy Stewart film, &quot;Take Her, She&#x27;s Mine&quot; (1963), playing a beatnik poet working at a coffee shop. Denver also appeared in the beach film &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot; (1964) with Tina Louise prior to the development of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;.

Other films in which Denver appeared include &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Mint?&quot; (1967), &quot;The Sweet Ride&quot; (1968), &quot;Did You Hear the One About the Traveling Saleslady?&quot; (1968) with Phyllis Diller, and &quot;The Wackiest Wagon Train in the West&quot; (1976). In 1983, he appeared in the television movie &quot;High School U.S.&quot;. His final role was a small part in the Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello comedy &quot;Back to the Beach&quot; (1987).

===Other work===

In 1970, Denver replaced Woody Allen in the original Broadway production of Allen&#x27;s comedy &quot;Play It Again, Sam&quot;, earning praise from &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Clive Barnes for conveying &quot;a genuine clown-like wistfulness&quot; that Barnes had found lacking in Allen&#x27;s own performance in the starring role.

==Personal life and death==
Denver was married four times. With his first wife he had son and a daughter. He was later married to Jean Webber (1967–1970) and Carole Abrahams (1972–1975), and with the latter fathered a daughter, Emily. His last wife was Dreama Perry, to whom he was married until his death and with whom he fathered a son, Colin.

On February 7, 1971, Denver was arrested in Anderson, California for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his car and pleaded no contest for a reduced sentence of a $250 fine. In 1998, he was arrested for marijuana delivered to his home, originally saying that the delivery came from Dawn Wells, who played Mary Ann on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, but he later refused to name her in court, testifying that &quot;some crazy fan must have sent it.&quot; He pleaded no contest and received six months probation.

Later in his life, Denver returned to his adopted home of Princeton, West Virginia, and became an FM radio personality. He and his wife Dreama ran a small &quot;oldies format&quot; radio station, WGAG-LP 93.1 FM. He also earned a small income making public appearances, often costumed as Gilligan. In 1992, he played Gilligan to benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation for a West Virginia fundraiser for the organization.

Denver was a heavy smoker. He received cancer treatment and underwent heart bypass surgery in 2005. On September 2, 2005, he died at age 70 from complications, including pneumonia following throat cancer surgery at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

<text>Albert Victor Samain (3 April 185818 August 1900) was a French poet and writer of the Symbolist school.

==Life and works==
Born in Lille, his family were Flemish and had long lived in the town or its suburbs. At the time of the poet&#x27;s birth, his father, Jean-Baptiste Samain, and his mother, Elisa-Henriette Mouquet, conducted a business in &quot;wines and spirits&quot; at 75 rue de Paris. Samain&#x27;s father died when he was quite young; it was necessary for him to leave school and seek a trade. He moved to Paris in around 1880, where his poetry won him a following and he began mixing with avant-garde literary society, and began publicly reciting his poems at &quot;Le Chat Noir&quot;. His poems were strongly influenced by those of Baudelaire, and began to strike a somewhat morbid and elegiac tone. He also was influenced by Verlaine; his works disclose a taste for indecisive, vague imagery. Samain helped found the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, and also worked on the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;.

Samain published three volumes of verse: &quot;Au Jardin de l&#x27;Infante&quot; (1893), which made him famous; &quot;Aux flancs du vase&quot; (1898) and &quot;Le Chariot d&#x27;or&quot; (1901). His poetic drama &quot;Polyphème&quot; was set to music by Jean Cras. Samain died of tuberculosis.

==Musical settings==
Many composers set Samain&#x27;s poetry to music, including Lili Boulanger, Nadia Boulanger, Alfredo Casella, Édouard Devernay, George Enescu, Gabriel Fauré, Swan Hennessy, Charles Koechlin, Jacques Leguerney, Adela Maddison, Georges Migot, Paul Paray, Ottorino Respighi, Adrien Rougier, Camille Saint-Saëns, Alice Sauvrezis, Marcelle Soulage, and others.

==Quotation==

:Je rêve de vers doux et d&#x27;intimes ramages,
:De vers à frôler l&#x27;âme ainsi que des plumages,

:De vers blonds où le sens fluide se délie
:Comme sous l&#x27;eau la chevelure d&#x27;Ophélie,

:De vers silencieux, et sans rythme et sans trame
:Où la rime sans bruit glisse comme une rame,

:De vers d&#x27;une ancienne étoffe, exténuée,
:Impalpable comme le son et la nuée,

:De vers de soir d&#x27;automne ensorcelant les heures
:Au rite féminin des syllabes mineures.

:De vers de soirs d&#x27;amour énervés de verveine,
:Où l&#x27;âme sente, exquise, une caresse à peine...

:Je rêve de vers doux mourant comme des roses.

:::::--&quot;Au Jardin de l&#x27;Infante&quot;

<doc id="179512" wikidata="Q1287451" url="?curid=179512" title="Jumping the shark">
<text>The idiom &quot;jumping the shark&quot; or to &quot;jump the shark&quot; means that a creative work or entity has evolved and reached a point in which it has exhausted its core intent and is introducing new ideas that are discordant with or an extreme exaggeration (caricature) of its original theme or purpose. The phrase was coined in 1985 by radio personality Jon Hein in response to a 1977 episode from the fifth season of the American sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;, in which the character of Fonzie (Henry Winkler) jumps over a live shark while on water-skis.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
Future radio personality Jon Hein and his University of Michigan roommate Sean Connolly coined the phrase in 1985 in response to season 5, episode 3, &quot;Hollywood: Part 3&quot; of the ABC-TV sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;, which was originally broadcast on September 20, 1977. In the episode, the central characters visit Los Angeles, where a water-skiing Fonzie (Henry Winkler) answers a challenge to his bravery by wearing swim trunks and his trademark leather jacket, and jumping over a confined shark. The stunt was created as a way to showcase Winkler&#x27;s real-life waterskiing skills.

In 1997, Hein created a website, JumpTheShark.com, to publish a list of approximately 200 television shows, and his arguments as to the moments each &quot;jumped the shark&quot;. The site became popular, and grew with additional user-contributed examples. Hein sold his company, Jump The Shark, Inc., for &quot;over $1 million&quot; in 2006.

=== Responses ===

==== Ron Howard ====
In 2006, during his contribution to &quot;The Interviews: An Oral History of Television&quot;, Ron Howard (Richie Cunningham) talked about the &quot;Happy Days&quot; episode that inspired the phrase:
&quot;I remember Donny Most and I sitting there, looking at the script. Donny was really upset. He said, &#x27;Oh man look at what our show has kind of devolved into. It&#x27;s not even very funny, and you know Fonz is jumping over a shark&#x27;... and I kept saying &#x27;Hey Donny we&#x27;re a hit show, relax. You know it&#x27;s hard to have great episodes one after another. Fonzie jumping over a shark, it&#x27;s gonna be funny and great...&#x27; I remember thinking that creatively this was not our greatest episode, but I thought it was a pretty good stunt, and I understood why they wanted to do it. And what I remember the most is, it was fun actually driving the speedboat which I did a bit of, noticing that Henry was really a pretty good water skier... But the thing that has to be remembered about the jumping the shark idea, is that the show went on to be such a massive success for years after that. So, it&#x27;s kind of a fun expression, and I get a kick out of the fact that they identified that episode (because granted maybe it was pushing things a little too far), but I think a lot of good work was still done after that show, and audiences seemed to really respond to it.&quot;

==== Fred Fox Jr. ====
In a 2010 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, former &quot;Happy Days&quot; writer Fred Fox Jr., who wrote the episode that later spawned the phrase, said &quot;Was the [shark jump] episode of &quot;Happy Days&quot; deserving of its fate? No, it wasn&#x27;t. All successful shows eventually start to decline, but this was not &quot;Happy Days&quot;″ time.&quot; Fox also points not only to the success of that episode (&quot;a huge hit&quot; with over 30 million viewers), but also to the continued popularity of the series. 

==== Henry Winkler ====
In a 2019 interview with NPR, Henry Winkler (Fonzie) told Terry Gross that the origin of the stunt began with the fact that he had been a water-skiing instructor as a teenager at a summer camp. Thus, his father used to say to him &quot;every day for years—tell Garry Marshall that you water ski. Dad, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to do that. No, no. Tell him you water ski. It&#x27;s very important. I finally tell Garry, my father wants you to know I water ski.&quot; Winkler did all of the water skiing for the scene himself, except for the actual jump. The jump was performed by professional water skier Ricky McCormick. Gross then asked Winkler what it was &quot;about that scene or that episode that came to signify when something&#x27;s time is up—when it&#x27;s over?&quot; Winkler responded: &quot;You know what? I don&#x27;t know. To them, the Fonz water skiing was just like the last straw. The only thing is it wasn&#x27;t to the audience because we were No. 1 for years after that. So it didn&#x27;t much matter to anybody.&quot; In addition, Winkler told TheWrap in 2018 that he is &quot;not embarrassed&quot; by the phrase. He stated that &quot;newspapers would mention jumping the shark... and they would show a picture of me in my leather jacket and swim shorts water-skiing. And at that time I had great legs. So I thought, &#x27;I don&#x27;t care.&#x27; And we were No. 1 for the next four or five years.&quot; As Winkler&#x27;s character Barry Zuckerkorn, in the sitcom &quot;Arrested Development,&quot; hopped over a shark in episode 13 of the second season, Winkler also noted that there &quot;was a book, there was a board game and it is an expression that is still used today... [and] I&#x27;m very proud that I am the only actor, maybe in the world, that has jumped the shark twice—once on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and once on &quot;Arrested Development&quot;.&quot;

=== Others ===
Some writers have argued that while &quot;Happy Days&quot; did eventually (figuratively) &quot;jump the shark&quot;, it was not during that episode.

== Broader usage ==

The idiom has been used to describe a wide variety of situations, such as the state of advertising in the digital video recorder era, and views on rural education policy, the anomalous pursuit of a company acquisition, and the decline of republics into degraded democracy and empire.

=== Examples ===
In September 2011, Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann repeated an anecdote claiming that the HPV vaccine causes &quot;intellectual disability&quot;; this prompted political commentator Rush Limbaugh to say on his radio show, &quot;Michele Bachmann, she might have blown it today. Well, not blown it—she might have jumped the shark today.&quot;

In January 2018, political commentator Keith Olbermann criticized the inclusion of esports players on the sports journalism website &quot;The Players&#x27; Tribune&quot;, saying that they &quot;have jumped the shark by publishing pieces by snotty random kids playing children&#x27;s games&quot; in response to an article by Doublelift, a &quot;League of Legends&quot; player.

In May 2021, CNBC news anchor Carl Quintanilla proposed that Elon Musk had jumped the shark with his advocacy of cryptocurrencies instead of focusing on Tesla, Inc., as it began to lose market share and its stock price began to plunge.

=== Nuking the fridge ===

In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; identified a term modeled after &quot;jump the shark&quot;: &quot;nuke the fridge&quot;. Specifically applicable to film, the magazine defined the term: &quot;to exhaust a Hollywood franchise with disappointing sequels.&quot;

The phrase derives from a scene in the fourth &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot;, in which Indiana Jones survives an atomic bomb detonation by fitting himself into a lead-lined refrigerator to shield himself from the explosion. The blast completely annihilates its surroundings but sends the refrigerator flying a sufficient distance away for the protagonist to escape unharmed. The scene was criticized as being scientifically implausible.

Within two days of the film&#x27;s premiere, the phrase &quot;nuke the fridge&quot; had gone viral, describing film scenes that similarly stretched credulity. Director Steven Spielberg later said the scene was &quot;my silly idea&quot; and was glad to have been part of the pop-culture phrase, while the film&#x27;s executive producer George Lucas took similar credit believing that Jones would have had an even chance of surviving the explosion.

=== Growing the beard ===

&quot;Growing the beard&quot; refers to the opposite of jumping the shark; i.e. when a show dramatically improves in quality. In the series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; the second season is considered to be better in terms of storytelling over the first season. This shift coincided with character William Riker, who was clean-shaven for the first season, growing a mustache and beard that he retained for the second season and most Star Trek media afterwards.

<text>Natalie Clifford Barney (October 31, 1876 – February 2, 1972) was an American writer who hosted a literary salon at her home in Paris that brought together French and international writers. She influenced other authors through her salon and also with her poetry, plays, and epigrams, often thematically tied to her lesbianism and feminism.

Barney was born into a wealthy family. She was partly educated in France, and expressed a desire from a young age to live openly as a lesbian. She moved to France with her first romantic partner, Eva Palmer. Inspired by the work of Sappho, Barney began publishing love poems to women under her own name as early as 1900. Writing in both French and English, she supported feminism and pacifism. She opposed monogamy and had many overlapping long and short-term relationships, including on-and-off romances with poet Renée Vivien and courtesan Liane de Pougy and longer relationships with writer Élisabeth de Gramont and painter Romaine Brooks. 

Barney hosted a salon at her home at 20-22 rue Jacob in the 6th arrondissement of Paris for more than 60 years, bringing together writers and artists from around the world, including many leading figures in French, American, and British literature. Attendees of various sexualities expressed themselves and mingled comfortably at the weekly gatherings. She worked to promote writing by women and hosted a &quot;Women&#x27;s Academy&quot; (L&#x27;Académie des Femmes) in her salon as a response to the all-male French Academy. The salon closed for the duration of World War II while Barney lived in Italy with Brooks. She initially espoused some pro-fascist views, but supported the Allies by the end of the war. After the war, she returned to Paris, resumed the salon, and continued influencing or inspiring writers such as Truman Capote.

Barney had a wide literary influence. Remy de Gourmont addressed public letters to her using the nickname &quot;l&#x27;Amazon&quot; (the Amazon), and Barney&#x27;s association with both de Gourmont and the nickname lasted until her death. Her life and love affairs served as inspiration for many novels written by others, ranging from de Pougy&#x27;s erotic French bestseller &quot;Idylle Saphique&quot; to Radclyffe Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, the most famous lesbian novel of the twentieth century.

==Early life==
Barney was born in 1876 in Dayton, Ohio, to Albert Clifford Barney and Alice Pike Barney. Alice learned to love the arts from her father, who owned Pike&#x27;s Opera House in Cincinnati, Ohio. Albert Barney partially inherited his family&#x27;s railroad car manufacturing company, Barney &amp; Smith Car Works.

When Barney was five years old, she encountered Oscar Wilde at a New York hotel. Wilde scooped her up as she ran past him fleeing a group of small boys and held her out of their reach. Then he sat her down on his knee and told her a story. The next day he joined Barney and her mother on the beach, and Wilde inspired Alice to pursue art seriously, which she did despite her husband&#x27;s disapproval. 

Like many girls of her time, Barney had a haphazard education. Her interest in the French language began with a governess who read Jules Verne stories aloud to her, so she would have to learn quickly to understand them. She and her younger sister Laura attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school in Fontainebleau, France, founded by feminist Marie Souvestre. As an adult, she spoke and wrote French fluently.

When she was ten, her family moved from Ohio to the Sheridan Circle area of Washington D.C., spending summers at their large cottage in Bar Harbor, Maine. As the rebellious and unconventional daughter of one of the wealthiest families in town, she was often mentioned in Washington newspapers. In her early twenties she made headlines by galloping through Bar Harbor while driving a second horse on a lead ahead of her, riding astride instead of sidesaddle.

Barney later said she knew she was a lesbian by age twelve, and she was determined to &quot;live openly, without hiding anything&quot;.

==Early relationships==

===Eva Palmer===
Barney&#x27;s earliest intimate relationship was with Eva Palmer. They became acquainted during summer vacations in Bar Harbor, Maine, and began a sexual relationship during one such trip in 1893. Barney likened Palmer&#x27;s appearance to that of a medieval virgin. The two remained close for several years. As young adults in Paris they shared an apartment at 4 rue Chalgrin and eventually took their own residences in Neuilly. Barney frequently solicited Palmer&#x27;s help in her romantic pursuits of other women, including Pauline Tarn. Palmer ultimately left Barney&#x27;s side for Greece and eventually married Angelos Sikelianos. Their relationship did not survive this turn of events: Barney took a dim view of Angelos and heated letters were exchanged. Later in their lives the friendship was repaired through correspondence and reunions in New York.

===Liane de Pougy===

In 1899, after seeing the courtesan Liane de Pougy at a dance hall in Paris, Barney presented herself at de Pougy&#x27;s residence in a page costume and announced she was a &quot;page of love&quot; sent by Sappho. Although de Pougy was one of the most famous women in France, constantly sought after by wealthy and titled men, Barney&#x27;s audacity charmed her.

Barney stood to inherit some family wealth held in trust if she either married or waited for her father&#x27;s death. While courting de Pougy, Barney was engaged to Robert Cassat, a member of another wealthy railroad family. Barney was open with Cassat about her love of women and relationship with de Pougy. In the hopes of securing the Barney trust money, the three briefly considered a rushed wedding between Barney and Cassat and an adoption of de Pougy. When Cassat ended the engagement, Barney attempted unsuccessfully to persuade her father to give her the money anyway.

By the end of 1899, the two had broken up after quarreling repeatedly over Barney&#x27;s desire to &quot;rescue&quot; de Pougy from her life as a courtesan. Despite the breakup, the two continued having liaisons for decades.

Their on-and-off affair became the subject of de Pougy&#x27;s tell-all &quot;roman à clef&quot;, &quot;Idylle Saphique&quot; (&quot;Sapphic Idyll&quot;). Published in 1901, the book and its sexually suggestive scenes became the talk of Paris, reprinted more than 70 times in its first year. Barney was soon well known as the model for one of the characters.

Barney herself contributed a chapter to &quot;Idylle Saphique&quot; in which she described reclining at de Pougy&#x27;s feet in a screened box at the theater, watching Sarah Bernhardt&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. During intermission, Barney (as &quot;Flossie&quot;) compares Hamlet&#x27;s plight with that of women: &quot;What is there for women who feel the passion for action when pitiless Destiny holds them in chains? Destiny made us women at a time when the law of men is the only law that is recognized.&quot; She also wrote &quot;Lettres à une Connue&quot; (&quot;Letters to a Woman I Have Known&quot;), her own epistolary novel about the affair. Although Barney failed to find a publisher for the book and later called it naïve and clumsy, it is notable for its discussion of homosexuality, which Barney regarded as natural and compared to albinism. &quot;My queerness,&quot; she said, &quot;is not a vice, is not deliberate, and harms no one.&quot;

===Renée Vivien===

In November 1899, Barney met the poet Pauline Tarn, better known by her pen name Renée Vivien. For Vivien it was love at first sight, while Barney became fascinated with Vivien after hearing her recite one of her poems, which Barney described as &quot;haunted by the desire for death&quot;. Their romantic relationship was also a creative exchange that inspired both of them to write. Barney provided a feminist theoretical framework which Vivien explored in her poetry. They adapted the imagery of the Symbolist poets along with the conventions of courtly love to describe love between women, also finding examples of heroic women in history and myth. Sappho was an especially important influence and they studied Greek so as to read the surviving fragments of her poetry in the original. Both wrote plays about her life.
Vivien saw Barney as a muse and as Barney put it, &quot;she had found new inspiration through me, almost without knowing me&quot;. Barney felt Vivien had cast her as a &quot;femme fatale&quot; and that she wanted &quot;to lose herself... entirely in suffering&quot; for the sake of her art. Vivien also believed in monogamy, which Barney was unwilling to agree to. While Barney was visiting her family in Washington, D.C. in 1901, Vivien stopped answering her letters. Barney tried to get her back for years, at one point persuading a friend, operatic mezzo-soprano Emma Calvé, to sing under Vivien&#x27;s window so she could throw a poem (wrapped around a bouquet of flowers) up to Vivien on her balcony. Both flowers and poem were intercepted and returned by a governess.

In 1904 she wrote &quot;Je Me Souviens&quot; (&quot;I Remember&quot;), an intensely personal prose poem about their relationship which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien in an attempt to win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and discussed starting a school of poetry for women like the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward, but instead stayed with the Baroness. This time, the breakup was permanent.

Vivien&#x27;s health declined rapidly after this. The author Colette, who herself had an affair with Barney in 1906, was Vivien&#x27;s friend and neighbor. According to Colette, Vivien ate almost nothing and drank heavily, even rinsing her mouth with perfumed water to hide the smell. Colette&#x27;s account has led some to call Vivien an anorexic, but this diagnosis did not yet exist at the time. Vivien was also addicted to the sedative chloral hydrate. In 1908 she attempted suicide by overdosing on laudanum and died the following year. In a memoir written fifty years later, Barney said, &quot;She could not be saved. Her life was a long suicide. Everything turned to dust and ashes in her hands.&quot;

In 1949, two years after the death of Hélène van Zuylen, Barney restored the Renée Vivien Prize with a financial grant under the authority of the &quot;Société des gens de lettres&quot; and took on the chairmanship of the jury in 1950.

===Olive Custance===

Barney purchased and read &quot;Opals&quot; in 1900, a debut collection of poems by Olive Custance. Responding to the lesbian themes in the poetry, Barney began corresponding with Custance and exchanging poems. The two met in 1901 at Barney and Vivien&#x27;s home in Paris, and they soon began a short romantic relationship. While Barney&#x27;s infidelity aggravated Vivien, Custance was also pursuing a relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas, who she would later marry.

==Poetry and plays==
In 1900, Barney published her first book, a collection of poems called &quot;Quelques Portraits-Sonnets de Femmes&quot; (&quot;Some Portrait-Sonnets of Women&quot;). The poems were written in traditional French verse and a formal, old-fashioned style since Barney did not care for free verse. &quot;Quelques Portraits&quot; has been described as &quot;apprentice work&quot;, a classifier which betrays its historical significance. According to biographer Suzanne Rodriguez, the collection&#x27;s publication meant that Barney became the first woman poet to openly write about the love of women since Sappho. Her mother contributed pastel illustrations of the poems&#x27; subjects, wholly unaware three of the four women who modelled for her were her daughter&#x27;s lovers.

Reviews were generally positive and glossed over the lesbian theme of the poems, some even misrepresenting it. The &quot;Washington Mirror&quot; said Barney &quot;writes odes to men&#x27;s lips and eyes; not like a novice, either&quot;. However, a headline in a society gossip paper cried out &quot;Sappho Sings in Washington&quot; and this alerted her father, who bought and destroyed the publisher&#x27;s remaining stock and printing plates.

To escape her father&#x27;s sway Barney published her next book, &quot;Cinq Petits Dialogues Grecs&quot; (&quot;Five Short Greek Dialogues&quot;, 1901), under the pseudonym Tryphé. The name came from the works of Pierre Louÿs, who helped edit and revise the manuscript. Barney also dedicated the book to him. The first of the dialogues is set in ancient Greece and contains a long description of Sappho, who is &quot;more faithful in her inconstancy than others in their fidelity&quot;. Another argues for paganism over Christianity. After the death of Barney&#x27;s father in 1902, his approximately $9 million fortune ($ million in 2018) was left in trust with annual income to be split equally between Barney, her mother, and her sister. His death and the money freed her from any need to conceal the authorship of her books; she never used a pseudonym again. She considered scandal &quot;the best way of getting rid of nuisances&quot; (meaning heterosexual attention from young men). 
&quot;Je Me Souviens&quot; was published in 1910, after Vivien&#x27;s death. That same year, Barney published &quot;Actes et Entr&#x27;actes&quot; (&quot;Acts and Interludes&quot;), a collection of short plays and poems. One of the plays was &quot;Équivoque&quot; (&quot;Ambiguity&quot;), a revisionist version of the legend of Sappho&#x27;s death: instead of throwing herself off a cliff for the love of Phaon the sailor, she does so out of grief that Phaon is marrying the woman she loves. The play incorporates quotations from Sappho&#x27;s fragments, with Barney&#x27;s own footnotes in Greek, and was performed with ancient Greek-inspired music and dance.

Barney did not take her poetry as seriously as Vivien did, saying &quot;if I had one ambition it was to make my life itself into a poem&quot;. Her plays were only performed through amateur productions in her garden. According to Karla Jay, most of them lacked coherent plots and &quot;would probably baffle even the most sympathetic audience&quot;. After 1910 she mostly wrote the epigrams and memoirs, for which she is better known. Her last book of poetry was called &quot;Poems &amp; Poemes: Autres Alliances&quot; and came out in 1920, bringing together romantic poetry in both French and English. Barney asked Ezra Pound to edit the poems, but ignored his detailed recommendations.

==Salon==

For over 60 years, Barney hosted a literary salon, first in Neuilly but mostly at her home at 20, Rue Jacob, in Paris. Her salon was a weekly, Friday gathering at which people met to socialize and discuss literature, art, music and any other topic of interest. Though she hosted some of the most prominent male writers of her time, Barney strove to shed light on female writers and their work.

In addition to its focus on women, Barney&#x27;s salon was distinguished by its deliberately international character. She brought together expatriate Modernists with members of the French Academy. The salon Biographer Joan Schenkar described Barney&#x27;s salon as &quot;a place where lesbian assignations &quot;and&quot; appointments with academics could coexist in a kind of cheerful, cross-pollinating, cognitive dissonance&quot;. The range of sexualities welcomed at the salon was also uncommon in Paris, and Barney&#x27;s openness with her own sexuality made her salon comfortable to homosexual or bisexual attendees.

In the 1900s Barney held early gatherings of the salon at her house in Neuilly. The entertainment included poetry readings and theatricals (in which Colette sometimes performed). Mata Hari performed a dance once, riding into the garden naked as Lady Godiva on a white horse harnessed with turquoise cloisonné. The play &quot;Equivoque&quot; may have led Barney to leave Neuilly in 1909. According to a contemporary newspaper article, her landlord objected to her holding an outdoor performance of a play about Sappho, which he felt &quot;followed nature too closely&quot;. She canceled her lease and rented the pavilion on Rue Jacob in Paris&#x27;s Latin Quarter, and her salon was held there until the late 1960s. This was a small two-story house, separated on three sides from the main building on the street. Next to the pavilion was a large, overgrown garden with a Doric &quot;Temple of Friendship&quot; tucked into one corner. In this new location, the salon grew a more prim outward face, with poetry readings and conversation, perhaps because Barney had been told the pavilion&#x27;s floors would not hold up to large dancing parties. Frequent guests during this period included poets Pierre Louÿs and Paul Claudel, diplomat Philippe Berthelot and translator J. C. Mardrus.

During World War I, the salon became a haven for those opposed to the war. Henri Barbusse gave a reading from his anti-war novel &quot;Under Fire&quot; and Barney hosted a Women&#x27;s Congress for Peace. Other visitors to the salon during the war included Oscar Milosz, Auguste Rodin and poet Alan Seeger, who came while on leave from the French Foreign Legion.
Ezra Pound was a close friend of Barney&#x27;s and often visited. The two schemed together to subsidize Paul Valéry and T. S. Eliot so they could leave their jobs and focus on writing, but Valéry found other patrons and Eliot refused the grant. Pound introduced Barney to avant-garde composer George Antheil, and, while her own taste in music leaned towards the traditional, she hosted premieres of Antheil&#x27;s &quot;Symphony for Five Instruments&quot; and &quot;First String Quartet&quot;. It was also at Barney&#x27;s salon that Pound met his longtime mistress, the violinist Olga Rudge.

In 1927 Barney started an &quot;Académie des Femmes&quot; (Women&#x27;s Academy) to honor women writers. This was a response to the influential Académie Française (French Academy) which had been founded in the 17th century by Louis XIII and whose 40 members included no women at the time. Unlike the French Academy, Barney&#x27;s was not a formal organization but rather a series of readings held as part of the regular Friday salons. Honorees included Colette, Gertrude Stein, Anna Wickham, Rachilde, Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, Mina Loy, Djuna Barnes and posthumously, Renée Vivien. The academy&#x27;s activities wound down after 1927.

Other visitors to the salon during the 1920s included French writers Jeanne Galzy, André Gide, Anatole France, Max Jacob, Louis Aragon and Jean Cocteau. English-language writers also visited, including Ford Madox Ford, W. Somerset Maugham, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, Thornton Wilder, T. S. Eliot and William Carlos Williams. Barney also hosted German poet Rainer Maria Rilke, Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore (the first Nobel laureate from Asia), Romanian aesthetician and diplomat Matila Ghyka, journalist Janet Flanner (also known as Genêt, who set the &quot;New Yorker&quot; style), journalist, activist and publisher Nancy Cunard, publishers Caresse and Harry Crosby, publisher Blanche Knopf, art collector and patron Peggy Guggenheim, Sylvia Beach (the bookstore owner who published James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;), painters Tamara de Lempicka and Marie Laurencin and dancer Isadora Duncan.

For her 1929 book &quot;Aventures de l&#x27;Esprit&quot; (&quot;Adventures of the Mind&quot;) Barney drew a social diagram which crowded the names of over a hundred people who had attended the salon into a rough map of the house, garden and Temple of Friendship. The first half of the book had reminiscences of 13 male writers she had known or met over the years and the second half had a chapter for each member of her &quot;Académie des Femmes&quot;.

In the late 1920s Radclyffe Hall drew a crowd reading her novel &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, recently banned in the UK. A reading by poet Edna St. Vincent Millay packed the salon in 1932. At another Friday salon in the 1930s Virgil Thomson sang from &quot;Four Saints in Three Acts&quot;, an opera based on a libretto by Stein.

Of the famous Modernist writers who spent time in Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an appearance at the salon. James Joyce came once or twice but did not care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday but did come once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, though he ended up too nervous to bring up the subject.

==Epigrams and novel==
&quot;Éparpillements&quot; (&quot;Scatterings&quot;, 1910) was Barney&#x27;s first collection of &quot;pensées&quot;—literally, thoughts. This literary form had been associated with salon culture in France since the 17th century, when the genre was perfected at the salon of Madame de Sablé. Barney&#x27;s &quot;pensées&quot;, like de Sablé&#x27;s own &quot;Maximes&quot;, were short, often one-line epigrams or &quot;bon mots&quot; such as &quot;There are more evil ears than bad mouths&quot; and &quot;To be married is to be neither alone nor together.&quot;
Her literary career got a boost after she sent a copy of &quot;Éparpillements&quot; to Remy de Gourmont, a French poet, literary critic, and philosopher who had become a recluse after contracting the disfiguring disease lupus vulgaris in his thirties. He was impressed enough to invite her to one of the Sunday gatherings at his home, at which he usually received only a small group of old friends. She was a rejuvenating influence in his life, coaxing him out for evening car rides, dinners at the Rue Jacob, a masked ball, even a short cruise on the Seine. He turned some of their wide-ranging conversations into a series of letters that he published in the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, addressing her as &quot;l&#x27;Amazone,&quot; a French word that can mean either &quot;horsewoman&quot; or &quot;Amazon&quot;; the letters were later collected in book form. He died in 1915, but the nickname he gave her would stay with her all her life—even her tombstone identifies her as &quot;the Amazon of Remy de Gourmont&quot;—and his &quot;Letters to the Amazon&quot; left readers wanting to know more about the woman who had inspired them.

Barney obliged in 1920 with &quot;Pensées d&#x27;une Amazone&quot; (&quot;Thoughts of an Amazon&quot;), her most overtly political work. In the first section, &quot;Sexual Adversity, War, and Feminism&quot;, she developed feminist and pacifist themes, describing war as an &quot;involuntary and collective suicide ordained by man&quot;. In war, she said, men &quot;father death as women mother life, with courage and without choice&quot;. The epigrammatic form makes it difficult to determine the details of Barney&#x27;s views; ideas are presented only to be dropped, and some &quot;pensées&quot; seem to contradict others. Some critics interpret her as saying that the aggression that leads to war is visible in all male relationships. Karla Jay, however, argues that her philosophy was not that sweeping, and is better summed up by the epigram &quot;Those who &quot;love&quot; war lack the love of an adequate sport—the art of living.&quot;

Another section of &quot;Pensées d&#x27;une Amazone&quot;, &quot;Misunderstanding, or Sappho&#x27;s Lawsuit&quot;, gathered historical writings about homosexuality along with her own commentary. She also covered topics such as alcohol, friendship, old age, and literature, writing &quot;Novels are longer than life&quot; and &quot;Romanticism is a childhood ailment; those who had it young are the most robust.&quot; A third volume, &quot;Nouvelles Pensées de l&#x27;Amazone&quot; (&quot;New Thoughts of the Amazon&quot;), appeared in 1939.

&quot;The One Who is Legion, or A.D.&#x27;s After-Life&quot; (1930) was Barney&#x27;s only book written entirely in English, as well as her only novel. Illustrated by Romaine Brooks, it concerns a person who committed suicide, known only as A.D., who is brought back to life as a genderless, hermaphroditic being and reads the book of their own life. This book-within-a-book, entitled &quot;The Love-Lives of A.D.&quot;, is a collection of hymns, poems and epigrams, much like Barney&#x27;s own other writings.

==Major relationships==

Despite several of her lovers&#x27; objections, Barney practiced, and advocated, non-monogamy. As early as 1901, in &quot;Cinq Petits Dialogues Grecs,&quot; she argued in favor of multiple relationships and against jealousy; in &quot;Éparpillements&quot; she wrote &quot;One is unfaithful to those one loves in order that their charm does not become mere habit&quot;. While she could be quite jealous herself, she actively encouraged at least some of her lovers to be non-monogamous as well.

Due in part to Jean Chalon&#x27;s early biography of her, published in English as &quot;Portrait of a Seductress&quot;, Barney had become more widely known for her many relationships than for her writing or her salon. She once wrote out a list, divided into three categories: liaisons, demi-liaisons, and adventures. Colette was a demi-liaison, while the artist and furniture designer Eyre de Lanux, with whom she had an off-and-on affair for several years, was listed as an adventure. Among the liaisons—the relationships that she considered most important—were Custance, Vivien, Élisabeth de Gramont, Brooks, and Dolly Wilde. Many of her affairs, like those with Colette and Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, evolved into lifelong friendships.

===Élisabeth de Gramont===
Élisabeth de Gramont, the Duchess of Clermont-Tonnerre, was a writer best known for her popular memoirs. A descendant of Henry IV of France, she had grown up among the aristocracy; when she was a child, according to Janet Flanner, &quot;peasants on her farm ... begged her not to clean her shoes before entering their houses&quot;. Her father&#x27;s ancestors had squandered their fortune and he married into the Rothschild family after her birth; she did not have any access to her step-mother&#x27;s wealth. She looked back on this lost world of wealth and privilege with little regret, and became known as the &quot;red duchess&quot; for her support of socialism. Encouraged by her father to wed into security, she married Philibert de Clermont-Tonnere and had two daughters. He was violent and tyrannical. 

The poet Lucie Delarue-Mardrus introduced Barney and de Gramont in 1909 or 1910. The couple shared academic interests and attended Remy de Gourmont&#x27;s salon together.
Barney wrote an unpublished novel inspired by their early relationship, &quot;L’Adultère ingénue&quot; (&quot;The Adulterous Ingénue&quot;). 

De Gramont accepted Barney&#x27;s nonmonogamy—perhaps reluctantly at first—and went out of her way to be gracious to her other lovers, always including Brooks when she invited Barney to vacation in the country.

Though the two conducted their affair clandestinely, de Gramont&#x27;s husband found them out and attempted to stop them from seeing each other. He was unsuccessful, and he divorced de Gramont in 1920 after a period of separation. In 1918 she and Barney wrote up a marriage contract stating: &quot;No one union shall be so strong as this union, nor another joining so tender—nor relationship so lasting&quot;. The relationship continued until de Gramont&#x27;s death in 1954.

===Romaine Brooks===

Barney&#x27;s longest relationship was with the American painter Romaine Brooks, whom she met around 1915. Brooks specialized in portraiture and was noted for her somber palette of gray, black, and white. During the 1920s she painted portraits of several members of Barney&#x27;s social circle, including de Gramont and Barney herself.

Brooks tolerated Barney&#x27;s casual affairs well enough to tease her about them, and had a few of her own over the years, but could become jealous when a new love became serious. Usually she simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an ultimatum to choose between her and Dolly Wilde—relenting once Barney had given in. At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, she did not want to live with her as a full-time couple; she disliked Paris, disdained Barney&#x27;s friends, hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived, and felt that she was fully herself only when alone. To accommodate Brooks&#x27;s need for solitude they built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a dining room, which they called &quot;Villa Trait d&#x27;Union&quot;, the hyphenated villa. Brooks also spent much of the year in Italy or travelling elsewhere in Europe, away from Barney. Their relationship lasted for over fifty years.

===Dolly Wilde===

Dolly Wilde was the niece of Oscar Wilde and the last of her family to bear the Wilde name. She was renowned for her epigrammatic wit but, unlike her famous uncle, never managed to apply her gifts to any publishable writing; her letters are her only legacy. She did some work as a translator and was often supported by others, including Barney, whom she met in 1927.

Barney&#x27;s support of Wilde included occasional permission to stay for a few weeks at Rue Jacob. Brooks&#x27; disapproval of the relationship increased over the years, aggravated by Wilde&#x27;s presence in Barney&#x27;s home. Wilde, the only of Barney&#x27;s loves to share her enthusiastic rejection of monogamy, strove conscientiously but futilely for Brooks&#x27; favor. This culminated in Brooks&#x27; ultimatum, delivered in 1931, in which she described Wilde as a rat &quot;gnawing at the very foundation of our friendship&quot;. Barney chose Brooks and separated from Wilde; Brooks later allowed Wilde to return and became less critical of Wilde&#x27;s ways.

Like Vivien, Wilde was intensely self-destructive and struggled deeply with mental illness. She attempted suicide several times, and spent much of her life addicted to alcohol and heroin. Barney, a vocal opponent of drug use and alcoholism, financed drug detoxifications several times; to no avail. Wilde even emerged from one nursing-home stay with a new dependency on the sleeping draught paraldehyde, then available over-the-counter.

In 1939, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and refused surgery, seeking alternative treatments. The following year, World War II separated her from Barney; she fled Paris for England while Barney went to Italy with Brooks. She died in 1941 from causes never fully explained; with one of the most common speculations being a paraldehyde overdose. Her will, written in 1932, named Barney as her only heir.

==World War II and after==
Barney&#x27;s attitudes during World War II have been controversial. In 1937, Una, Lady Troubridge, complained that Barney &quot;talked a lot of half-baked nonsense about the tyranny of fascism&quot;. Barney herself had Jewish heritage, and since she spent the war in Florence with Brooks, was investigated by Italian authorities because of this; she was able to escape their attention after her sister Laura arranged for a notarized document attesting to her confirmation. 

Nevertheless, she believed Axis propaganda that portrayed the Allies as the aggressors. Therefore, pro-Fascism seemed to her to be a logical consequence of her pacifism. An unpublished memoir she wrote during the war years is pro-Fascist and anti-Semitic, quoting speeches by Hitler, apparently with approval.

It is possible that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, she may have been influenced by Ezra Pound&#x27;s anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States. By the end of the war her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.

&quot;Villa Trait d&#x27;Union&quot; was destroyed by bombing. After the war, Brooks declined to live with Barney in Paris; she remained in Italy, and they visited each other frequently. Their relationship remained mostly monogamous until the mid-1950s, when Barney met her last new love, Janine Lahovary, the wife of a retired Romanian ambassador. Lahovary made a point of winning Brooks&#x27;s friendship, Barney reassured Brooks that their relationship still came first, and the triangle appeared to be stable.

The salon resumed in 1949 and continued to attract young writers for whom it was as much a piece of history as a place where literary reputations were made. Truman Capote was an intermittent guest for almost ten years; he described the decor as &quot;totally turn-of-the-century&quot; and remembered that Barney introduced him to the models for several characters in Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;. 

Alice B. Toklas became a regular after her partner Stein&#x27;s death in 1946. Fridays in the 1960s honored Mary McCarthy and Marguerite Yourcenar, who in 1980—eight years after Barney&#x27;s death—became the first female member of the French Academy.

Barney did not return to writing epigrams, but did publish two volumes of memoirs about other writers she had known, &quot;Souvenirs Indiscrets&quot; (&quot;Indiscreet Memories&quot;, 1960) and &quot;Traits et Portraits&quot; (&quot;Traits and Portraits&quot;, 1963). She also worked to find a publisher for Brooks&#x27;s memoirs and to place her paintings in galleries.

In the late 1960s Brooks became increasingly reclusive and paranoid; she sank into a depression and refused to see the doctors Barney sent. Bitter at Lahovary&#x27;s presence during their last years, which she had hoped they would spend exclusively together, she finally broke off contact with Barney. Barney continued to write to her, but received no replies. Brooks died in December 1970, and Barney on February 2, 1972, aged 95, from heart failure. She is buried at Passy Cemetery, Paris, Île-de-France, France. She left some of her writing, including more than 40,000 letters, to the Bibliothèque littéraire Jacques-Doucet in Paris.

==Legacy==

By the end of Natalie Barney&#x27;s life her work had been largely forgotten. In 1979, Barney was honored with a place setting in Judy Chicago&#x27;s feminist work of art &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;. In the 1980s Barney began to be recognized for what Karla Jay calls an &quot;almost uncanny anticipation&quot; of the concerns of later feminist writers. English translations of some of her memoirs, essays, and epigrams appeared in 1992, but most of her plays and poetry are untranslated.

Her indirect influence on literature, through her salon and her many literary friendships, can be seen in the number of writers who have addressed or portrayed her in their works. &quot;Claudine s&#x27;en va&quot; (&quot;Claudine and Annie&quot;, 1903) by Colette contains a brief appearance by Barney as &quot;Miss Flossie&quot;, echoing the nickname she had earlier been given in de Pougy&#x27;s novel &quot;Idylle Saphique&quot;. Renée Vivien wrote many poems about her, as well as a Symbolist novel, &quot;Une femme m&#x27;apparut&quot; (&quot;A Woman Appeared to Me&quot;, 1904), in which Barney is described as having &quot;eyes... as sharp and blue as a blade... The charm of peril emanated from her and drew me inexorably.&quot; Remy de Gourmont addressed her in his &quot;Letters to the Amazon&quot;, and Truman Capote mentioned her in his last, unfinished novel &quot;Answered Prayers&quot;. She also appeared in later novels by writers who never met her. Anna Livia&#x27;s &quot;Minimax&quot; (1991) portrays both Barney and Renée Vivien as still-living vampires. Francesco Rapazzini&#x27;s &quot;Un soir chez l&#x27;Amazone&quot; (2001) is a historical novel about Barney&#x27;s salon. The English translation by Sally Hamilton and Suzanne Stroh was published as an audiobook read by Suzanne Stroh under the title &quot;A Night at the Amazon&#x27;s&quot; (2020).

Barney appears in Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot; as the salon hostess Valérie Seymour, a symbol of self-acceptance in contrast with the protagonist&#x27;s self hatred. Hall wrote: &quot;Valérie, placid and self-assured, created an atmosphere of courage; everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour&#x27;s.&quot; According to Lillian Faderman, &quot;There was probably no lesbian in the four decades between 1928 and the late 1960s capable of reading English or any of the eleven languages into which the book was translated who was unfamiliar with &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;.&quot;

Lucie Delarue-Mardrus wrote love poems to Barney in the early years of the century, and in 1930 depicted her in a novel, &quot;L&#x27;Ange et les Pervers&quot; (&quot;The Angel and the Perverts&quot;), in which she said she &quot;analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me&quot;. The protagonist of the novel is a hermaphrodite named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien. The book&#x27;s portrayal of her is, at times, harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys. Marion tells Wells that she is &quot;perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... [but] a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion... [Y]ou are capable of loving someone just as they are, even a thief—in that lies your only fidelity. And so you have my respect.&quot;

After meeting Barney in the 1930s, the Russian poet Marina Ivanovna Tsvetaeva addressed her in a &quot;Letter to the Amazon&quot; (1934) in which she expressed her conflicted feelings about love between women. The result, according to Terry Castle, is &quot;an entirely cryptic, paranoid, overwhelming piece of reverie&quot;. 

Barney and the women in her social circle are the subject of Djuna Barnes&#x27;s &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; (1928), a &quot;roman à clef&quot; written in an archaic, Rabelaisian style, with Barnes&#x27;s own illustrations in the style of Elizabethan woodcuts. She has the lead role as Dame Evangeline Musset, &quot;who was in her Heart one Grand Red Cross for the Pursuance, the Relief and the Distraction, of such Girls as in their Hinder Parts, and their Fore Parts, and in whatsoever Parts did suffer them most, lament Cruelly&quot;. &quot;[A] Pioneer and a Menace&quot; in her youth, Dame Musset has reached &quot;a witty and learned Fifty&quot;; she rescues women in distress, dispenses wisdom, and upon her death is elevated to sainthood. Also appearing pseudonymously are de Gramont, Brooks, Dolly Wilde, Hall and her partner Una, Lady Troubridge, Janet Flanner and Solita Solano, and Mina Loy. The obscure language, inside jokes, and ambiguity of &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot; have kept critics arguing about whether it is an affectionate satire or a bitter attack, but Barney herself loved the book and reread it throughout her life.

On October 26, 2009, Barney was honored with a historical marker in her home town of Dayton, Ohio. The marker is the first in Ohio to note the sexual orientation of its honoree.

Barney&#x27;s French novel, &quot;Amants féminins ou la troisième&quot;, believed to have been written in 1926, was published in 2013. It was translated into English by Chelsea Ray and published in 2016 as &quot;Women Lovers or The Third Woman&quot;.

<text>A sport kite, also commonly known as a stunt kite, is a type of multiline kite that can be maneuvered in the air. 
A related kite, also controllable and used for recreation, but capable of generating a significant amount of pull and used for providing movement, is the power kite.

==Configuration==

One common configuration for a sport kite is a roughly triangular &quot;delta&quot; shape based on the Rogallo wing, with two lines for control. Another common configuration is a W-shaped panel based on the Hadzicki wing, with four lines for control. These kites are normally constructed from lightweight ripstop nylon or ripstop polyester with spars made from carbon fiber tubing. The flying lines are made from braided ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene, which is light, does not stretch under tension and stays slippery even when wrapped many times.

Dual-line sport kites are controlled by the pilot adding and releasing tension on the right and left lines. A pilot may pull on the right-hand line to turn right, pull left-hand line to turn left, pull equally for straight flight, push the left-hand line to release air and turn right, and so on. The pitch can be controlled by walking/running forward or backwards, giving the lines different amounts of tension. Using a combination of pulls (to add tension or direct kite motion) and pushes (to give slack and let float into motion), complex tricks and patterns can be flown. These range in difficulty from turns, loops and landings, to maneuvers where the kite is flipped and turned end over end, wrapping the lines or floating on its front or back. During diving maneuvers sport kites may reach speeds of , while in stall type maneuvers they can remain nearly motionless. This type of stall allows for various other acrobatic maneuvers to be performed.

Quad-line kites are controlled with a pair of handles, each with two lines attached to the top and bottom and attached to the kite correspondingly. To control the kite the pilot applies tension to the four lines, typically all four lines have some tension with some lines drawn back more than the others. The kite experiences more force on the lines held on higher tension. The pitch of the kite affects lift and forward drive, and since each of four lines can be moved the kite can be tilted, rotated, twisted, or pitched in any direction. Skilled use of these handles allows a quad-line kite to perform in ways that are difficult or impossible with a dual-line kite. Unique quad-line maneuvers include reverse flight, axis spins, hovers, and side to side flight.

Although some individuals consider fighter kites to be sport kites, they are generally considered a different category. Fighter kites rely on their instability to enter spins or fly straight using line tension on a single kite line. In contrast, sport kites use multiple control lines to precisely steer in any direction and control speed.

==Types==
There are three main categories of sport kites:

===Traditional dual-line sport kites===

Controllable dual line kites have been around since at least the mid-1800s, and likely much earlier considering the history of kites into antiquity. Multi-line sport kites were popularized by designs of Francis Rogallo and Domina Jalbert, which were used in televised water skiing shows and movies in the 1960s. The Rogallo wing&#x27;s simple design of triangular fabric was easy for amateurs to construct on their own. Larger kites were capable of pulling pilots or lifting passengers in water ski shows, smaller designs were flown by pilots on beaches or stands. Traditional sport kites were most prevalent from the 1970s through the 1990s. The sport kites were increasingly built for precise control, which featured heavily in competitions and demonstrations.

Kites are generally considered traditional or &quot;old school&quot; when they are flat and lack modern features. Traditional sport kites are generally flat when not billowed under wind pressure, although some later and transitionary models may include short standoffs. They often are heavier than modern kite designs with a straight-line triangular appearance. Flying was generally limited to linear flying and precise turns relying on straight-on wind pressure. The addition of standoffs, small rods to continually maintain the sail tension and the billowed shape, with kites becoming able to perform actions on slack lines generally and the ability to perform multi-dimensional acrobatic tricks marked the transition from traditional to modern designs.

===Modern dual-line sport kites===
In the 1990s sport kites saw a design change which transformed sport kite flying. Rather than requiring wind to provide billowed sail shape to catch the wind, designers formed the kite into a 3D shape allowing it to catch the wind at any angle, even when slack, drifting backward, or lying on its back. As the kite was no longer relying on wind pressure to hold its shape there were pronounced gains in competitive precision flying (especially in light winds) and creation of an entirely new branch of slackline trick flying. The major defining factor in modern kites are standoffs, which provide a 3D shape to kites even when not billowed from wind pressure. Modern kites may have additional features like yo-yo stoppers for catching the line on tricks, ballast weights to improve stability or increase instability, tapered spars to allow twisted or curved shapes, multiple horizontal spreaders to introduce curved or recurved leading edges, and battens to further modify or reinforce the shape. The size, aspect ratio, billow, camber, balance and similar design factors all affect how the kite performs.
Kites favoring team or precision flying tend to move with more precision and stability, often with a feeling of weight, that taken together make it easier for a team to fly in uniform formation. This style of flying is about demonstrating control of the kite, through flying in preset patterns, in ballet choreographed to music, or through similar complex or precise maneuvers. Kites favoring trick or freestyle flying tend to prefer agility and dexterity, sometimes described as feeling &#x27;floaty&#x27;, for improved ability to perform 3D slackline maneuvers. This style of flying can push kites to their limits with the kite flipping and rotating in extreme, acrobatic ways.

===Quad-line kites===
Quad line kites have been in use since at least 1899, documented in designs likely simultaneously invented by Wilbur Wright, John J. Montgomery, and possibly other aviation pioneers for flight control by warping the wing shape which featured as part of the Wright brothers patent war. Modern quad-line sport kites were re-popularized in 1988 with the creation of the &quot;Neos Omega&quot;, later called the &quot;Revolution 1&quot;. Both historic and modern quad-line kites allow the four lines to tension different areas of the sail body, resulting in both sail shape deformation and tension changes which in turn control the flight.

The modern quad line kites were popularized through 1989 being flown in the &quot;innovative&quot; competition category, and were quickly adopted by top fliers. Performances with the kites achieved top rankings at many competitions in 1989. Quad-line kites further gained popularity after sport kite team The Flying Squad quad-line team won back to back STACK European championships and later Team iQuad receiving industry awards for promoting the sport globally between 2006-2012. Revolution Kites initially dominated the quad-line market thanks to patent protections, but competing brands proliferated after the patents expired.

Quad-line kites are noticeable by the way that they can hover in space unlike any other sport kite. These kites can be extremely precise, hover in orientation, fly in any direction including sideways and reverse, even land at a specific spot on a wingtip.

Sport kites can be designed to fly in a wide range of conditions. Many standard kites fly best in winds from . &quot;Ultralight&quot; and &quot;super ultralight&quot; designs are made from lightweight materials that can be flown in the slightest breeze or even indoors with calm air. High wind kite designs are often made with mesh panels or an &quot;air brake&quot; attached to the lines to fly in higher winds up to approximately . Wind ranges depend significantly on the skill of the pilot; novice or first time fliers may have difficulty keeping a kite airborne believing the wind is too light while experienced pilots nearby are performing acrobatic tricks in the same wind. For smooth and consistent flying a steady breeze is required, uninhibited by trees, buildings, hills, or other tall objects which may block the wind.

Professional quality kites are made from multiple synthetic materials. Kite sails are primarily made from lightweight ripstop polyester which has been chemically treated to minimize stretch, repel water, increase airtightness, and be UV resistant. Edge material is often heavyweight Dacron or Kevlar to provide reinforcement and strength. Kite frames typically use wrapped carbon fiber tubes which are lightweight and stiff, yet can flex to absorb strong wind forces and survive hard crashes. Kite lines are made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene like Spectra or Dyneema woven specifically for kite line to have minimal stretch under tension and slip over itself even when wrapped over itself many times from kites spinning midair. Some have wingtip and tail weight attachments which change the flight characteristics of the kite, making some advanced maneuvers easier or more dramatic. Reinforcements and connectors may be made from nylon, Mylar, aluminum, and similar materials.

A dual-line kite can range from $50 for a beginner kite, to over $300 for competition and performance quality kites. A quad-line kite can range from $150 for a beginner kite to over $400 for professional quality kites. Flying lines are commonly from $50 to over $100 per set.

Some kite designs may be classified as power kites and traction kites, which can be used to tow wheeled kite buggies (kite buggying) or surfboards (kite surfing). Power kites vary in size from &quot;trainers&quot; which often have dual-lines and a small sail area, to large full size traction kites with four lines, designed to pull people on kite boards or vehicles. Many of these strong-pulling designs include a safety strap which can be engaged in emergencies to release or depower the kite, with some designs adding an additional (third or fifth) line for this purpose.

==Accessories==

Many sport kite pilots have a variety of line sets, in different lengths and strengths (normally measured in lbs or pounds) to suit the wind conditions. Specialized kite bags are designed to tote a collection of kites, along with line sets and repair materials such as tedlar tape (for fixing punctured sails) and spare parts. Kite cases or bags also facilitate traveling with kites, some designed to fit into the overhead compartments on airplanes. Other accessories include hand-held (digital) anemometers for accurate wind speed information and LED lights that attach to the frame of the kite to allow for night flying. Some manufacturers offer replacement spars or spare components for their kites, for replacing damaged components after a particularly unforgiving crash landing.

==Competition==

Developments in multi-line kites allowed forms of kite flying to develop into a sport. Kite competitions have much in common with figure skating, with competitors being judged on their performance in compulsory figures as well as a ballet-style flying using artistic interpretation of music. Performances are done as individuals, a pair of pilots, or as a team. Team flying is typically the most spectacular, with typically four pilots flying within centimeters of each other and narrowly averting disaster, while performing all manner of figures and formations in the air.

Competitions are held nationally and internationally under the auspices of Sport Team and Competitive Kiting (STACK). There is a bi-annual World Championship or World Kite Cup, typically held at Berck sur Mer, France, last held in April 2024. The 2020 and 2022 events were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. In the United States, the American Kitefliers Association (AKA) is the umbrella organization for sport kite contests; competition winners from the various regions are invited to the annual AKA convention for national championships. Other national organizations include the All-Japanese Sport Kite Association (AJSKA), FFVL France, FLD ev Germany, STACK Holland, STACK-Italia, and STACK-UK.

In 1996 the organizations AKA, STACK, and AJSKA formed the International Rule Book Committee (IRBC) to standardize rules and processes. The rulebooks include overall rules for events, descriptions of figures which may be selected for compulsory-figure flying, and guidelines for judging assorted events.

<text>The Battle of Milne Bay (25 August – 7 September 1942), also known as Operation RE or the Battle of Rabi (ラビの戦い) by the Japanese, was a battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II. Japanese naval infantry, known as &quot;Kaigun Tokubetsu Rikusentai&quot; (Special Naval Landing Forces), with two small tanks attacked the Allied airfields at Milne Bay that had been established on the eastern tip of New Guinea. Due to poor intelligence work, the Japanese miscalculated the size of the predominantly Australian garrison and, believing that the airfields were defended by only two or three companies, initially landed a force roughly equivalent in size to one battalion on 25 August 1942. The Allies, forewarned by intelligence from Ultra, had heavily reinforced the garrison.

Despite suffering a significant setback at the outset, when part of their small invasion force had its landing craft destroyed by Royal Australian Air Force aircraft as they attempted to land on the coast behind the Australian defenders, the Japanese quickly pushed inland and began their advance towards the airfields. Heavy fighting followed as they encountered the Australian Militia troops that formed the first line of defence. These troops were steadily pushed back, but the Australians brought forward veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units that the Japanese had not expected. Allied air superiority helped tip the balance, providing close support to troops in combat and targeting Japanese logistics. Finding themselves heavily outnumbered, lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties, the Japanese withdrew their forces, with fighting coming to an end on 7 September 1942.

The battle is often described as the first major battle of the war in the Pacific in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces. Although Japanese land forces had experienced local setbacks elsewhere in the Pacific earlier in the war, unlike at Milne Bay, these earlier actions had not forced them to withdraw completely and abandon their strategic objective. Nor did they have such a profound impact upon the thoughts and perceptions of the Allies towards the Japanese, and their prospects for victory. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. As a result of the battle, Allied morale was boosted and Milne Bay was developed into a major Allied base, which was used to mount subsequent operations in the region.
==Background==

===Geography===
Milne Bay is a sheltered bay at the eastern tip of the Territory of Papua (now part of Papua New Guinea). It is long and wide, and is deep enough for large ships to enter. The coastal area is flat with good aerial approaches, and therefore suitable for airstrips, although it is intercut by many tributaries of rivers and mangrove swamps. Owing to the swampy lands and high rainfall, about per year, the area is prone to malaria and flooding. After floods, the coastal plains become &quot;virtually impassable quagmires of glutinous mud&quot;, and the ground is not suited for development. The bay is bounded to its north and south by the Stirling Ranges, which at points rise to and are covered in Kunai grass and dense scrubland. The main area of firm ground suitable for construction and development is found directly at the head of the bay. In 1942 this area was occupied by plantations of palm oil, coconuts and cocoa, as well as a number of jetties and villages, connected by what was described by Major Sydney Elliott-Smith of the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) as a &quot;modest &#x27;road&#x27; system&quot; that was, in actuality, only a dirt track wide. The area was sparsely populated, although there were a number of villages along the track. Ahioma was situated the farthest east, and together with Gili Gili in the west, it bounded Lilihoa, Waga Waga, Goroni, KB Mission, Rabi and Kilarbo.

===Military situation===
The Japanese thrust into the Pacific region had begun in early December 1941 with attacks against British and Commonwealth forces in the Battle of Hong Kong and the Malayan campaign, and against the US Pacific Fleet, much of which was caught at anchor in Pearl Harbor. They rapidly advanced south, overwhelming resistance in Malaya, capturing Singapore in February 1942, and successfully occupying Timor, Rabaul and the Dutch East Indies. While a Japanese naval operation aimed at capturing Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May, elsewhere American forces in the Philippines capitulated, and Japanese forces advanced towards India through Burma.

Although the Japanese had been defeated in the Coral Sea, another attempt at capturing Port Moresby was anticipated. The Allied Supreme Commander of the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, decided to establish airbases to protect Port Moresby. To the west, he authorised the construction of an airbase at Merauke in Netherlands New Guinea. Another, codenamed &quot;Boston&quot;, was authorised to the east in the largely unexplored Abau–Mullins Harbour area on 20 May. Any Japanese force approaching Port Moresby by sea would have to sail past these bases, allowing them to be detected and attacked earlier; but the base in the east had other advantages too. Bombers flying missions to Rabaul and other Japanese bases to the north from there would not have to overfly the Owen Stanley Range, and would not be subject to the vagaries of the weather and air turbulence over the mountains. For that reason, an airstrip suitable for heavy bombers was desired so that they could stage there from Port Moresby and bases in northern Australia.

The Commander in Chief of Allied Land Forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey, selected a garrison for Boston on 24 May. The troops were informed that their mission was only to defend against Japanese raids, and in the event of a major attack they would destroy everything of value and withdraw. The Boston project fell through, as a reconnaissance of the area gave an unfavourable report and Elliott-Smith suggested Milne Bay as a more suitable alternative site. A party of twelve Americans and Australians set out to explore Milne Bay in a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat on 8 June. They were impressed by the flat areas, the roads and the jetties, all of which would ease airbase construction. On receipt of a favourable report from the party, MacArthur&#x27;s General Headquarters (GHQ) cancelled Boston on 11 June and substituted Milne Bay. Milne Bay was given the codename &quot;Fall River&quot;. The use of place names as code names proved to be unwise, as some supplies were mistakenly sent to the real Fall River, in Massachusetts.

==Prelude==
===Allies===
The first troops arrived at Milne Bay from Port Moresby in the Dutch KPM ships and , escorted by the sloop and the corvette on 25 June. &quot;Karsik&quot; docked at a pontoon wharf that had been hastily constructed from petrol drums by Papuan workers, who had been recruited by ANGAU and who subsequently assisted in unloading the ships. The troops included two and a half companies and a machine gun platoon from the 55th Infantry Battalion of the 14th Infantry Brigade, the 9th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery with eight Bofors 40 mm guns, a platoon of the US 101st Coast Artillery Battalion (Anti-Aircraft) with eight .50 calibre machine guns, and two 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery. Company E of the 46th Engineers of the US Army Corps of Engineers arrived on &quot;Bontekoe&quot; with airbase construction equipment. Some 29 KPM ships had escaped to Australia after the fall of the Dutch East Indies. They were manned by Dutch and Javanese crews, and were the lifeline of the garrison at Milne Bay, making roughly two out of every three voyages there during the campaign, the remainder being by Australian, British and US ships. Five KPM ships would be lost during the fighting in Papua.

Work on the first airfield, which became known as No. 1 Airstrip, had commenced on 8 June, with the area near Gili Gili being cleared by Papuan workers under the supervision of ANGAU and by US 96th Engineer Separate Battalion personnel. Company E of the 46th Engineers began working on it on 30 June. In addition to the runway, they had to build camouflaged dispersal areas for 32 fighters, taxiways and accommodation for 500 men. To support the airbase and the garrison, a platoon was diverted to working on the docks and roads. Although the channels in Milne Bay allowed deep draught ships to approach within of the shore, they had to be unloaded onto pontoons and the stores manhandled onto vehicles, a labour-intensive process.

Three Kittyhawks from No. 76 Squadron RAAF landed on the airstrip on 22 July, while additional aircraft from No. 76 and also No. 75 Squadron RAAF arrived on 25 July. They found that only of the runway was covered with Marston Matting, and that water was frequently over it. Landing aircraft sprayed water about, and sometimes skidded off the runway and became bogged.

With No. 1 Airstrip operational, work began on two more airfields. Some 5,000 coconut trees were removed for No. 2 Airstrip, and the site was levelled and graded, but its use first required the construction of at least two bridges, so work moved to No. 3 Airstrip near Kilarbo. Its construction was undertaken by the 2nd Battalion of the US 43rd Engineers (less Company E), which arrived on 4 August. That day Japanese aircraft began to bomb and strafe Milne Bay, focusing upon attacking the airfields and the engineers as they worked. Four Zeros and a dive bomber attacked No. 1 Airstrip. One Kittyhawk was destroyed on the ground, while a Kittyhawk from No. 76 Squadron shot down the dive bomber. Following this, the Australians established a workable radar system to provide early warning. On 11 August, 22 Kittyhawks intercepted 12 Zeroes. Despite their numerical advantage, the Australians lost three Kittyhawks, while claiming four Japanese Zeros shot down.

On 11 July, troops of the 7th Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier John Field, began arriving to bolster the garrison. The brigade consisted of three Militia battalions from Queensland, the 9th, 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions. They brought with them guns of the 4th Battery of the 101st Anti-Tank Regiment, the 2/6th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, and the 2/9th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, along with the first Australian engineer unit, the 24th Field Company. Field assumed command of &quot;Milne Force&quot;, a task force which exercised operational control over all Allied air, land and naval forces in the area, but only when an attack was imminent. He reported directly to Blamey&#x27;s Allied Land Forces in Brisbane rather than New Guinea Force in Port Moresby. His most urgent tasks were of an engineering nature. While the American engineers built the airstrips and wharves, the Australians worked on the roads and accommodation. The small force of sappers had to be augmented by infantry and Papuan labourers.

Although malaria was known to be endemic in the Milne Bay area, precautions taken against the disease were haphazard. Men wore shorts and kept their sleeves rolled up. Their mosquito repellent cream was ineffective, quinine was in short supply and many men arrived without their mosquito nets, which were stowed deep in the ships&#x27; holds and took several days to unload. A daily dosage of was prescribed but Field&#x27;s troops were told not to take their quinine until they had been in the area a week. By this time, many had become infected with the disease. The Director of Medicine at Allied Land Forces Headquarters was Brigadier Neil Hamilton Fairley, an expert on tropical medicine. He visited Port Moresby in June, and was alarmed at the ineffectiveness of the measures being taken to combat the disease, which he realised was capable of destroying the entire Allied force in Papua. He made sure that the 110th Casualty Clearing Station left Brisbane for Milne Bay with a fully equipped pathological laboratory and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies, including 200,000 quinine tablets. However, some equipment was lost or ruined in transit, and the danger from malaria was not yet appreciated at Milne Bay.

The 55th Infantry Battalion&#x27;s companies were already badly afflicted by malaria and other tropical diseases, and were withdrawn and sent back to Port Moresby in early August, but the garrison was further reinforced with Second Australian Imperial Force troops of Brigadier George Wootten&#x27;s 18th Infantry Brigade of the 7th Division, which began arriving on 12 August, although it would not be complete until 21 August. This veteran brigade, which had fought in the siege of Tobruk earlier in the war, consisted of the 2/9th, 2/10th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions. Anti-aircraft and artillery support was provided by the 9th Battery of the 2/3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, the US 709th Anti-Aircraft Battery and the 9th Battery of the 2/5th Field Regiment, while various signals and logistics troops provided further support.

With two brigades now at Milne Bay, Major General Cyril Clowes was appointed to command Milne Force, which was placed under the control of New Guinea Force, now commanded by Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell, on 12 August. Clowes&#x27; headquarters was formed in Sydney at the end of July and was flown up to Milne Bay. He arrived with some of his staff on 13 August, but had to wait until the rest arrived before he could formally assume command of Milne Force on 22 August. By this time there were 7,459 Australian and 1,365 US Army personnel at Milne Bay, of whom about 4,500 were infantry. There were also about 600 RAAF personnel.

Clowes assigned the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role, guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack, and kept the veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve, ready to counterattack. Lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was unreliable in the conditions, the Australian command and control system consisted largely of cable telephones, or where there was not enough line available, runners. The soft ground made movement by road and even on foot difficult.

===Japanese===
Japanese aircraft soon discovered the Allied presence at Milne Bay, which was appreciated as a clear threat to Japanese plans for another seaborne advance on Port Moresby, which was to start with a landing at Samarai Island in the China Strait, not far from Milne Bay. On 31 July the commander of the Japanese XVII Army, Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake, requested that Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa&#x27;s 8th Fleet capture the new Allied base at Milne Bay instead. Mikawa therefore altered his plans for the Samarai operation, and substituted the capture of Milne Bay, which was codenamed Operation &quot;RE&quot;, and scheduled for the middle of August. Operation &quot;RE&quot; received a high priority after aircraft from the 25th Air Flotilla discovered the new Milne Bay airfields on 4 August, but was then postponed due to the American landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August.

Under the misconception that the airfields were defended by only two or three companies of Australian infantry (300–600 men), the initial Japanese assault force consisted of only about 1,250 personnel. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) was unwilling to conduct the operation as it feared that landing barges sent to the area would be attacked by Allied aircraft. Following an argument between IJA and Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) officers, it was agreed that the Navy would have responsibility for the landing. As a result, the assault force was drawn from the Japanese naval infantry, known as &quot;Kaigun Rikusentai&quot; (Special Naval Landing Forces). Some 612 naval troops from the 5th Kure Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF), led by Commander Shojiro Hayashi, were scheduled to land on the east coast near a point identified by the Japanese as &quot;Rabi&quot;, along with 197 men from the 5th Sasebo SNLF, led by Lieutenant Fujikawa. It was planned that a further 350 personnel from the 10th Naval Landing Force, along with 100 men from the 2nd Air Advance Party, would land via barge on the northern coast of the peninsula at Taupota, in Goodenough Bay, from where it would strike out over the Stirling Ranges to attack the Australians from behind. Following the battle, the chief of staff of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki, assessed that the landing force was not of a high calibre as it contained many 30- to 35-year-old soldiers who were not fully fit and had &quot;inferior fighting spirit&quot;. Naval support was to be provided by the 18th Cruiser Division under the command of Rear Admiral Mitsuharu Matsuyama. The Japanese enjoyed some initial advantage in the form of possessing two Type-95 light tanks. After an initial attack, however, these tanks became marooned in the mud and abandoned. They also had control of the sea during the night, allowing reinforcement and evacuation.

===Allied intelligence advantage===
Countering these Japanese tactical advantages, the Allies enjoyed the strategic advantage of possessing superior intelligence about Japanese plans. The Japanese knew very little about Allied forces at Milne Bay, while the Allies received advance warning that the Japanese were planning an invasion. In mid-July codebreakers under the command of Commander Eric Nave informed MacArthur that toward the end of August the Japanese planned to attack Milne Bay. They provided detailed information about the numbers of soldiers to expect, which units would be involved, their standard of training, and the names of the ships that the Japanese had allocated to the operation. MacArthur&#x27;s Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Brigadier General Charles A. Willoughby, had anticipated a Japanese reaction against Milne Force, and interpreted the Japanese reconnaissance on 4 August as foreshadowing an operation. After Allied Naval Forces signals intelligence, given the code word Ultra, which covered a number of codes including the Japanese naval code JN-25, decrypted a message that disclosed that a Japanese submarine picquet line had been established to cover the approaches to Milne Bay, Willoughby predicted that an attack was imminent. In response, MacArthur rushed the 18th Infantry Brigade to Milne Bay. Major General George Kenney, the commander of the Allied Air Forces, ordered air patrols stepped up over the likely Japanese invasion routes. He also ordered pre-emptive air strikes against the Japanese airfields at Buna on 24 and 25 August, which reduced the number of Japanese fighters available to support the attack on Milne Bay to just six.

==Battle==

===Initial landing===
Over the course of 23 and 24 August, aircraft from the 25th Air Flotilla carried out preparatory bombing around the airfield at Rabi. The main Japanese invasion force left Rabaul on 24 August, under Matsuyama&#x27;s command, at 7:00 am. The fleet was made up of two light cruisers, and , as well as three destroyers, , and , in concert with the transports, &quot;Nankai Maru&quot; and &quot;Kinai Maru&quot;, and the submarine chasers and .

At 8:30 am on 24 August, Milne Bay GHQ was alerted by an RAAF Hudson bomber near Kitava Island, off the Trobriand Islands, and coastwatchers that a Japanese convoy was approaching the Milne Bay area.  – escorting the transport SS &quot;Tasman&quot; – left the Milne Bay area and sailed for Port Moresby after learning of the invasion force. Reports of the second Japanese convoy, consisting of seven barges, which had sailed from Buna carrying the force that would land at Taupota were also received at this time. In response to this sighting, after the initially poor weather had cleared, 12 RAAF Kittyhawks were scrambled at midday. The barges were spotted beached near Goodenough Island where the 350 troops of the 5th Sasebo SNLF, led by Commander Tsukioka, had gone ashore to rest. The Australian pilots then proceeded to strafe the barges and, over the course of two hours, destroyed them all and stranded their former occupants.

After the initial sighting, the main invasion force, consisting of the heavy naval screening force and the two transports, remained elusive until the morning of 25 August. In an effort to intercept it, US B-17s operating from bases at Mareeba and Charters Towers in Queensland, were dispatched, although they were unable to complete their mission as bad weather closed in. Later in the afternoon, a number of Kittyhawks and a single Hudson bomber strafed the convoy and attempted to bomb the transports with bombs near Rabi Island. Only limited damage was caused to the convoy and no ships were sunk. After this, due to the withdrawal of the only Allied naval presence in the area – &quot;Arunta&quot; and &quot;Tasman&quot; – an RAAF tender was sent to act as a picket in the bay, ready to provide early warning of the approaching Japanese.

Meanwhile, earlier in the day, Clowes decided to shorten his lines and passed the order for D Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, which had been sent to Akioma in the east, to withdraw back behind &#x27;B&#x27; Company at KB Mission and reposition itself at the No. 3 Airstrip at Gili Gili. A shortage of water craft, however, delayed D Company&#x27;s departure until the evening of 25/26 August after requisitioning three luggers &quot;Bronzewing&quot;, &quot;Elevala&quot; and &quot;Dadosee&quot;. At around 10:30 pm, the Japanese main force, consisting of over 1,000 men and two Type 95 Ha-Go tanks, had made landfall near Waga Waga, on the northern shore of the bay; due to an error in navigation they came ashore about east of where they had intended, placing them further away from their objective. Nevertheless, they quickly sent out patrols to secure the area, rounding up local villagers, and established a beachhead.

Later that evening, two of the small water craft that D Company were using to withdraw to Gili Gili encountered the Japanese landing force. In the firefight that followed, one of the craft – &quot;Elevala&quot; – was forced to beach and its occupants forced to return by taking to the jungle on foot, eventually reaching Gili Gili some time later; the other, &quot;Bronzewing&quot;, was holed and of its passengers, 11 were killed either in the engagement or by the Japanese following their capture.

===Japanese advance inland===
By dawn of 26 August, advancing west along the coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle at the edge of the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked anti-armour weapons, the Australians were able to turn back the Japanese attack. At this stage, the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft, along with B-25s, B-26s and B-17s from the US Fifth Air Force. As a result of the attack, a number of Japanese troops were killed, while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed, as were a number of the landing barges which were beached near the KB Mission. Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather.

Nevertheless, the Japanese were still pressing on the 61st Infantry Battalion&#x27;s positions throughout the day. Field, who had command responsibility for the local area, decided to send two platoons from the 25th Infantry Battalion to provide support. Later, the remaining two rifle companies from the 61st were also dispatched, along with their mortar platoon. The muddy track meant that the Australians were unable to move anti-tank guns into position; however, as a stop-gap measure quantities of sticky bombs and anti-tank mines were moved up to the forward units. At 4:45 pm, with air and artillery support, the Australians launched a minor attack upon the Japanese forward positions which were located about to the east of the mission, pushing the Japanese back a further . Weary from the day&#x27;s fighting, though, they withdrew to Motieau, west of the mission.

The Australians then attempted to break contact and withdraw towards a creek line where they hoped to establish a defensive line as darkness came. The Japanese stayed in close contact with the Australians, harassing their rear elements. The men from B Company then sought to establish their position, while the 2/10th Infantry Battalion made preparations to move eastwards towards Ahioma, passing through the lines of the 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions. In the early evening, Japanese ships shelled the Australian positions and later, at 10:00 pm, the Japanese launched a heavy attack on the Australians which continued sporadically through the night. By 4:00 am the following morning, the Japanese began to employ infiltration and deception techniques to try to outflank the Australian positions. Anticipating an armoured attack at dawn, the Australians withdrew back to the Gama River, which was situated to the west. During the night, the destroyer &quot;Hamakaze&quot; entered the bay to make contact with the Japanese troops and land supplies. The landing force had been out of radio contact since 2:00 pm, and the destroyer was unable to raise it with either her radio or visual signalling devices. As a result, &quot;Hamakaze&quot; departed Milne Bay at 2:30 am without having landed any supplies.

Shortly after dawn, in the air, a Japanese force consisting of eight dive bombers with 12 Zero fighter escorts attacked the Allied airfield at Gili Gili. One of the attacking aircraft was shot down, while only a small amount of damage was inflicted. Meanwhile, around the mission as the Japanese reconnoitred Australian positions, the 2/10th Infantry Battalion, consisting of just 420 men, was ordered to the Gama River by Clowes. This operation was badly planned and did not have a clear purpose; it was launched as both a reconnaissance in force and a counter-attack, but evolved into an attempt to establish a blocking force at KB Mission. Moreover, while the Australians had no knowledge of the strength or intentions of the Japanese, no force would be able to reinforce the battalion once it moved outside the main defensive lines near the airstrips. The 2/10th&#x27;s forward patrols made contact with the 61st Infantry Battalion at around 10:30 am on 27 August and, upon arrival at around 5:00 pm, they began to establish their position; with only limited entrenching tools, they found the going difficult. At this point, the troops from the 25th and 61st Battalion were ordered to pull back, having lost 18 men killed and a further 18 wounded, along with an unknown number missing in action.

At 8:00 pm the Japanese sent two Type 95 tanks with bright headlights into the plantation. The men from the 2/10th tried to disable them with sticky bombs, but due to the humid conditions the bombs failed to adhere to the Japanese armour. In the fighting that followed over the course of two and a half hours, the Australians suffered heavy casualties. Receiving indirect fire support from the 2/5th Field Regiment&#x27;s 25 pounder guns situated near Gili Gili, they repelled four frontal attacks. However, by midnight the Japanese were inside the Australian position and in the confusion the 2/10th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on the west bank of the Gama, which they reached by about 2:00 am on 28 August. A further assault, however, by tank-mounted infantry forced them back further, moving back through the 61st and 25th Infantry Battalions towards No. 3 Airstrip, which was still under construction, south of Kilarbo. During the brief engagement around KB Mission, they had lost 43 men killed and another 26 wounded.

As the 2/10th withdrew, the 25th Infantry Battalion, which had moved forward from Gili Gili to relieve the 61st, deployed around the airstrip and at Rabi, Duira Creek and Kilarbo, laying mines in key locations. The airstrip proved a perfect defensive location, offering a wide, clear field of fire, while at its end, thick mud served to prevent the movement of Japanese tanks. Around dawn the advancing Japanese troops reached the airstrip and, under the cover of field artillery and mortars, they launched an attack. Although the Australians did not know it, the tanks that were supporting the attack became stuck in the mud and were subsequently abandoned; they would later be discovered by an Australian patrol on 29 August. Meanwhile, troops from the 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions, along with Americans from the 709th Anti-Aircraft Battery, turned back the attacking Japanese infantry. Further strafing by Kittyhawks followed, and the Japanese were forced to fall back to the east of Rabi.

Following this, for the next two days there was a lull in the fighting. During this time, the Australians consolidated their defences. The 61st Infantry Battalion, despite being seriously depleted from the previous fighting, were ordered back to the perimeter around the airstrip, subsequently deploying around Stephen&#x27;s Ridge, tying in with the 25th Battalion&#x27;s positions between the coast and Wehria Creek. Fire support was provided by mortars from the 25th along with Vickers machine guns from the 61st and .30 and .50 calibre machine guns mounted on the American half-tracks. The American engineers and anti-aircraft gunners became the first American troops to engage in ground combat in New Guinea.

Elsewhere, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion began moving forward from Waigani to enable it to join the fighting later as a counterattacking force. They, along with the 2/9th, were subsequently tasked to carry out an attack from No. 3 Airstrip to KB Mission. Meanwhile, the Japanese also sought to reconfigure their forces and Mikawa decided to reinforce the forces that were already ashore. These reinforcements, consisting of 567 men from the 3rd Kure SNLF and 200 from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF, left Rabaul on 28 August. At around 4:30 pm an RAAF patrol spotted the Japanese convoy – consisting of one cruiser and nine destroyers – and subsequently reported this to the Allied headquarters. Believing that further landings were about to occur, Clowes cancelled his plans to begin a counterattack with the troops from the 18th Brigade. Orders were also passed for the 30 Kittyhawks at Gili Gili to be flown off to Port Moresby in case the Japanese succeeded in breaking through to the airfield. The attack did not take place, though, and consequently early in the morning on 29 August they returned, albeit minus two aircraft which had crashed during the move.

The Japanese convoy arrived off Waga Waga at 8:15 pm on 29 August, and began landing troops and supplies. While this was taking place the warships shelled Allied positions around Gili Gili and by 11:30 pm, had completed their landing. The shelling was not significant, however, and no casualties resulted from it. Throughout 30 August, the Australians carried out patrolling operations while the Japanese laid up in the jungle in preparation for an attack that night.

Later that night the Japanese began forming up along the track at the eastern end of No. 3 Airstrip by the sea, and at 3:00 am on 31 August they launched their attack. Advancing over open ground and illuminated by flares fired by the Australians, the first Japanese attack was repelled by heavy machine gun and mortar fire from 25th and 61st Infantry Battalions as well as the 46th Engineer General Service Regiment, and artillery fire from the Australian 2/5th Field Regiment. A further two &quot;banzai&quot; charges were attempted only to meet the same fate, with heavy Japanese casualties, including the Japanese commander, Hayashi. At this point, Commander Minoru Yano, who had arrived with the Japanese reinforcements on 29 August, took over from Hayashi, and after the survivors of the attack had reformed in the dead ground around Poin Creek, he led them about north of the airstrip in an attempt to outflank the 61st Infantry Battalion&#x27;s positions on Stephen&#x27;s Ridge. After running into a platoon of Australians who engaged them with Bren light machine guns, the Japanese withdrew just before dawn to the sounds of a bugle call. The Japanese troops who survived this attack were shocked by the heavy firepower the Allied forces had been able to deploy, and the assault force was left in a state of disarray.

===Australian counterattack===
Early on 31 August, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion began moving towards KB Mission, with &#x27;D&#x27; Company leading the way and struggling through muddy conditions along the track, which had been turned into a quagmire due to the heavy rain and equally heavy traffic. After passing through the 61st Infantry Battalion&#x27;s position, at around 9:00 am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay. As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties. They also encountered several Japanese soldiers who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead. In response, some Australians systematically bayoneted and shot the bodies of Japanese soldiers. At noon, the 9th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit from the 7th Infantry Brigade, dispatched two companies to occupy some of the ground that the 2/12th had regained around No. 3 Airstrip and the mission.

Making slow going amidst considerable resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission late in the day. A force of Japanese remained there, and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.

That night, a force of around 300 Japanese who had been falling back since they had run into the 61st Infantry Battalion on Stephen&#x27;s Ridge, encountered positions manned by the 2/12th and 9th Infantry Battalions around the Gama River. In a surprise attack, the Australians inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese. After the battle the Australians estimated that up to 90 had been killed. Following this the Japanese began to employ infiltration techniques in an attempt to pass through the numerous listening posts that had been set up along the side of the track which formed the front of one side of the 2/12th&#x27;s position. Elsewhere, at the mission, starting at around 8:00 pm, they carried out harassment operations in an effort to distract the Australians and assist their comrades to try to break through the Australian positions from the Gama River. This lasted throughout the night.

The following morning, 1 September, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion went on the offensive again, while a force of seven Kittyhawks attacked the Japanese headquarters around Waga Waga. By this time, the Japanese had abandoned the objective of reaching the airfields and instead sought only to hold off the Australians long enough to be evacuated. This information was not known by the Allies, however, who were in fact expecting the Japanese to undertake further offensive action. In this regard, the 2/9th, initially with orders to join the 2/12th&#x27;s counterattack, was delayed an extra day after an erroneous intelligence report from MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters warning Clowes of a renewed Japanese attack forced him to briefly adopt a more defensive posture. The attack did not occur and, as a result, on 2 September the 2/9th was moved by barge up to the KB Mission. The next day it took over from the 2/12th and led the Australian advance. With the Japanese position at Milne Bay close to collapse, on 2 September Yano sent a radio message to the headquarters of the 8th Fleet which stated: &quot;[w]e have reached the worst possible situation. We will together calmly defend our position to the death. We pray for absolute victory for the empire and for long-lasting fortune in battle for you all&quot;.

The terrain in this part of the bay offered significant advantage to defending forces, lined as it was with numerous creeks which slowed movement and obscured firing lanes. Throughout 3 September, the 2/9th Infantry Battalion came up against significant resistance; in one engagement that took place around mid-morning along a stream to the west of Elevada Creek they lost 34 men killed or wounded as they attempted to force their way across a creek. Engaged with sustained machine gun fire, the two assault platoons withdrew back across the creek while elements of another company that was in support moved to the northern flank. Launching their assault, they found that the Japanese had withdrawn, leaving about 20 of their dead.

Following this, the 2/9th advanced a further , reaching Sanderson&#x27;s Bay, before deciding to set up their night location. That night Japanese ships again shelled Australian positions on the north shore of the bay, but without causing any casualties among the defenders.

On 4 September, the Australian advance continued as the 2/9th moved up the coast either side of the coastal track. After about one hour, the advance company struck a Japanese defensive position at Goroni. Throughout the day the Australians worked to outflank the position before launching an attack at 3:15 pm. During this action, one of the 2/9th&#x27;s sections was held up by fire from three Japanese machine gun positions. Corporal John French ordered the other members of the section to take cover before he attacked and destroyed two of the machine guns with grenades. French then attacked the third position with his Thompson submachine gun. The Japanese firing ceased and the Australian section advanced to find that the machine gunners had been killed and that French had been mortally wounded in front of the third position. Despite his wounds he was conscious and could talk and was aware of what he had done. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his &quot;cool courage and disregard of his own personal safety&quot; which &quot;saved members of his section from heavy casualties and was responsible for the successful conclusion of the attack&quot;. By the end of the 4th, the Japanese force included only 50 fully fit soldiers; all the other surviving troops were either incapacitated or could only offer token resistance. In addition, the commanders of all the Japanese companies had been killed and only three or four platoon leaders remained.

===Japanese withdrawal===
Following the fighting on 31 August, the Japanese forces ashore had reported the situation to their headquarters at Rabaul. In response, plans were made to send the Aoba Detachment, which comprised the Army&#x27;s 4th Infantry Regiment and an artillery company, to Rabi to complete the capture of the airfield. However, they were not scheduled to arrive until 11 September and so it was planned in the meantime to reinforce Yano&#x27;s men with 130 men from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF. An abortive attempt was made to land these troops on 2 September and then again on 4 September. By that time, however, as further reports were received by the Japanese headquarters, it became apparent that Yano&#x27;s troops would not be able to hold out until the Aoba Detachment could arrive. As a result, on 5 September, the Japanese high command ordered a withdrawal. This was carried out from the sea that evening.

Meanwhile, six Beauforts of No. 100 Squadron RAAF had arrived at Milne Bay on 5 September. An additional three Beaufighters of No. 30 Squadron RAAF, the first to operate this aircraft, joined them the following day. The Beauforts were tasked with providing additional support against further landings and undertaking anti-shipping missions. On 6 September, the Allied offensive reached the main camp of the Japanese landing force, fighting a number of minor actions against small groups that had been left behind after the evacuation.
Shortly after ten on the evening of 6 September, as the freighter was continuing unloading cargo under her lights, the port came under fire from the Japanese cruiser &quot;Tenryū&quot; and the destroyer with &quot;Anshun&quot; receiving about ten hits from the cruiser and rolling onto her side. The Japanese ships also shelled shore positions at Gili Gili and Waga Waga and illuminated, but did not fire on, the hospital ship &quot;Manunda&quot; which was displaying her hospital ship colours and lights. The next night, two Japanese warships – a cruiser and a destroyer – bombarded Australian positions causing a number of casualties for 15 minutes before leaving the bay; it would be their final act in the battle. During the mopping up operations that followed, patrols by Australian troops tracked down and killed a number of Japanese troops who were attempting to trek overland to Buna.

The 350 Japanese troops who had been stranded on Goodenough Island after their barges were destroyed on 24 August were not rescued until late October. An attempt to evacuate the force on 11 September ended in failure when the two destroyers assigned to this mission were attacked by USAAF aircraft, resulting in the loss of . Two further attempts to rescue the force on 13 and 22 September were unsuccessful, though supplies were air-dropped on Goodenough Island. A submarine landed further supplies and evacuated 50 sick personnel on 3 and 13 October. As part of the preparations for the attack on Buna and Gona, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion was assigned responsibility for securing Goodenough Island on 19 October. The battalion landed on the island three days later. A series of small engagements on 23 and 24 October cost the Australian force 13 killed and 19 wounded, and the Japanese suffered 20 killed and 15 wounded. The remaining Japanese troops were evacuated by two barges to nearby Fergusson Island on the night of 24 October, and the light cruiser &quot;Tenryū&quot; rescued them two days later. After securing the island, the 2/12th began work on building Vivigani Airfield on its east coast.

==Aftermath==

===Base development===
The Allies continued to develop the base area at Milne Bay in support of the counter-offensive along the northern coast of Papua and New Guinea. The American base became US Advanced Sub Base A on 21 April 1943, US Advance Base A on 14 August and US Base A on 15 November. Its Australian counterpart, the Milne Bay Base Sub Area, was formed on 14 June 1943. Two  coastal guns with searchlights were provided to protect the base from naval threats. New roads were built and the existing ones upgraded to make them passable in the wet conditions. A meteorological record was set on 29 April 1944, when of rain fell in a 24-hour period. By June 1944, there was over of road in the area.

A bitumen-surfaced second runway was built at No. 1 Airstrip by No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF, after which the original runway was only used for emergencies and taxiing. The minefield around No. 3 Airstrip was lifted and the airstrip was completed, with revetments and hardstands for 70 medium bombers. A new wharf, known as Liles&#x27; wharf after the American engineer who supervised its construction, was built in September and October 1942. This was capable of handling Liberty ships. Henceforth ships could sail direct to Milne Bay from the United States, reducing the pressure on Australian ports and saving two or three days&#x27; sailing time in addition to the time formerly taken to unload and then reload the cargo on smaller ships in those ports. PT boats were based at Milne Bay from December 1942, with PT boat overhaul facilities, a destroyer base, a transshipment and staging area and a Station Hospital also constructed.

On 14 April 1943, the Allied base was attacked by 188 Japanese aircraft during the Japanese air offensive, Operation I-Go. The base&#x27;s anti-aircraft defences were limited, but a force of 24 RAAF Kittyhawk fighters were on hand to respond to the attack. Minor damage was inflicted on the supply dumps around the airfields, while one British motorship, &quot;Gorgon&quot;, was damaged and &quot;Van Heemskerk&quot;, a Dutch transport carrying US troops, was sunk. At least three Allied aircraft were shot down, while the Japanese lost seven aircraft. Later, Milne Bay was used as a staging area for mounting the landing at Lae in September 1943, and the New Britain Campaign in December. The base at Milne Bay remained operational until the end of the war.

===War crimes===
During the Australian counterattack, the advancing troops found evidence that the Japanese had committed a number of war crimes at Milne Bay, specifically the execution of prisoners of war (POWs) and civilians. None of the 36 Australian troops who were captured by the Japanese survived; a number of them were found to have been executed with some showing signs of having been mutilated as well. In addition, at least 59 civilians were also murdered between 25 August and 6 September; included in this were a number of Papuan women who were sexually assaulted before being killed. The war crimes committed at Milne Bay hardened Australian soldiers&#x27; attitudes towards Japanese troops for the remainder of the war. Historian Mark Johnston has written that &quot;the Australians&#x27; relentless killing of Japanese then and thereafter owed much to a determination both to retaliate in kind and to take revenge for Japanese atrocities and rumoured maltreatment of POWs&quot;.

Later, the Australian Minister for External Affairs, Dr. H. V. Evatt, commissioned a report by William Webb on war crimes committed by the Japanese. Webb took depositions about the Milne Bay incident from members of the Allied forces who had been present, and used them to form part of his report. In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, which had been set up by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration. Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947, but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay.

===Results===
The Australians estimated Japanese casualties to be around 700 to 750 killed in action, and a Japanese source reported 625 killed in action. Of the 1,943 Japanese soldiers that were landed at Milne Bay, ships from the Japanese 18th Cruiser Division managed to evacuate 1,318 personnel, including 311 who were wounded. The Australians suffered 373 casualties, of which 167 were killed or missing in action. US forces lost 14 personnel killed and several wounded.

Although Allied casualties during the battle had been light, in the wake of the battle, Milne Bay suffered an epidemic of malaria that posed a threat to the base as great as that from the Japanese attack. Over one-sixth of Milne Force, including Clowes, came down with the disease. The incidence of malaria soared to 33 per thousand per week in September (equivalent to 1,716 per thousand per annum), and to 82 per thousand per week in December (equivalent to 4,294 per thousand per annum). At this rate, the whole force could have been incapacitated in a matter of months. It placed enormous strain on the medical units and the supplies of anti-malarial drugs. The Chief Pathologist of New Guinea Force, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford, went to see Blamey, who was now in personal command of New Guinea Force, and told him that 1,000 men and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies were urgently required at Milne Bay to avert a disaster. Blamey took a personal interest in the matter. He expedited supply shipments, and made the required personnel available. The arrival of quantities of the new drug atabrine allowed this more effective drug to be substituted for quinine. The incidence of malaria dropped dramatically after December, the month in which atabrine became the official Australian prophylactic drug, and by March 1943 the crisis had passed. After this, the incidence of malaria amongst the garrison at Milne Bay was similar to other bases in Papua and New Guinea.

Strategically, as a result of the fighting around Milne Bay, Japanese operations within the region were constrained. The defeat at Milne Bay kept them from bypassing the holding action that the Australians were conducting on the Kokoda Track. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. The Japanese commanders were then forced to change their plans in the region, shifting their focus towards repelling the US forces that had landed on Guadalcanal, while maintaining a smaller effort around Buna–Gona, under Major General Tomitarō Horii. Once they had retaken Guadalcanal, they planned to reinforce Horii&#x27;s forces and launch a reinvigorated attack on the Australians around Port Moresby. In the end, subsequent defeats at Buna–Gona and on Guadalcanal did not allow them to implement these plans, as the Allies gained the ascendency in the region throughout late 1942 and the Japanese were forced to fall back to the northern coast of New Guinea. In the aftermath of the battle, a large amount of intelligence was also gained by the Allies, providing their planners with a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese and their equipment. It also demonstrated that the Militia were an effective fighting force.

The most significant result, though, was the effect that the victory had on the morale of Allied servicemen elsewhere in Asia and the Pacific, especially those on the Kokoda Track, and British troops fighting in Burma. Although the Japanese had previously suffered minor local defeats, such as those around Changsha in China, as well as the first landing at Wake Island and the Battle of the Tenaru on Guadalcanal, these actions, unlike Milne Bay, had not resulted in complete Japanese withdrawal and the abandonment of the military campaign. The Allied victory at Milne Bay therefore represented the first &quot;full-scale defeat [of the Japanese] on land&quot;.

In Australia, initial public reaction to the victory at the time was one of cautious optimism. An article in &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; from early September 1942 labelled the victory a &quot;tonic surprise&quot;, and while highlighting the example as a portent of future battlefield success by Australian forces in the region, also pointed out the task that lay ahead of the Australians in New Guinea remained a &quot;major problem&quot;. Most significantly, though, it highlighted the importance of morale in turning the tide in the war, describing it as &quot;the bridge that must carry all the vast and complicated effort being directed towards victory&quot;. Another article, which appeared in &quot;The West Australian&quot; at the same time, while also preparing the Australian public for the tough fighting that would follow in New Guinea, hailed the victory at Milne Bay as a &quot;turning point&quot;, the instance of which signalled an end of a &quot;rearguard campaign&quot; and the start of an Allied offensive in the region.

Amongst individual Australian soldiers, the news of the victory helped to dispel some of the notions about the invincibility of the Japanese soldier that had developed in the psyche of Allied soldiers following the defeats of early 1942, and which had impacted on Allied planning up to that point. Some of these notions would remain until the end of the war, but the news of Milne Bay allowed some soldiers to rationalise the Japanese soldiers&#x27; past victories as being the result of tangible factors, such as numerical superiority, that could be overcome, rather than innate factors associated with the intangible qualities of the Japanese soldier that were not so easily overcome. After this, amongst the Allies there was &quot;a sense that fortune&#x27;s wheel was turning&quot;, and although leaders such as Blamey emphasised the difficulties that lay ahead, a feeling of confidence in eventual victory emerged. MacArthur warned the War Department that success was attributable to good intelligence that allowed him to concentrate a superior force at Milne Bay, and might not be repeatable.

After the war, the Australian Army commemorated the battle through the awarding of a battle honour titled &quot;Milne Bay&quot; to a number of the units that took part. The units chosen were the 9th, 25th, 61st, 2/9th, 2/10th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions. The two RAAF fighter squadrons that had taken part in the fighting were also singled out for praise by the Australian commanders for their role in the battle. Rowell stated: &quot;the action of 75 and 76 Squadrons RAAF on the first day was probably the decisive factor&quot;, a view Clowes endorsed in his own report.

Unusual among governors, the governor of Connecticut has no power to pardon. The governor of Connecticut is automatically a member of the state&#x27;s Bonding Commission. He is an ex-officio member of the board of trustees of the University of Connecticut and Yale University.

There have been 69 post-Revolution governors of the state, serving 73 distinct spans in office. Four have served non-consecutive terms: Henry W. Edwards, James E. English, Marshall Jewell, and Raymond E. Baldwin. The longest terms in office were in the state&#x27;s early years, when four governors were elected to nine or more one-year terms. The longest was that of the first governor, Jonathan Trumbull, who served over 14 years, but 7 of those as colonial governor; the longest-serving state governor — with no other position included in the term — was his son, Jonathan Trumbull Jr., who served over 11 years. The shortest term was that of Hiram Bingham III, who served only one day before resigning to take an elected seat in the United States Senate. Additionally, Lowell Weicker is noted for a rare third party win in American politics, having been elected to a term in 1990 representing A Connecticut Party.

The current governor is Ned Lamont, a Democrat who took office on January 9, 2019.

== Governors ==

Connecticut was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on January 9, 1788. Before it declared its independence, Connecticut was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain.

Connecticut did not create a state constitution for itself until several decades after it became a state; until 1818, the state operated under the provisions of its colonial charter. The charter called for the election of a governor every year, but not more than once every two years, with the term commencing on the second Thursday in May.

The current Constitution of Connecticut, ratified in 1965, calls for a four-year term for the governor, commencing on the Wednesday after the first Monday in the January following an election. The previous constitution of 1818 originally had only a one-year term for governor; this was increased to two years in 1875, and four years in 1948. The 1875 amendment also set the start date of the term to its current date; before then, it was the first Wednesday in the May following an election. The constitution provides for the election of a lieutenant governor for the same term as the governor. The two offices are elected on the same ticket; this provision was added in 1962. In the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Before the adoption of the 1965 constitution, the lieutenant governor only acted as governor. There is no limit of any kind on the number of terms one may serve.

<doc id="179529" wikidata="Q2355655" url="?curid=179529" title="Harry Crosby">
<text>Harry Crosby (June 4, 1898 – December 10, 1929) was an American heir, World War I veteran, bon vivant, poet, and publisher who for some epitomized the Lost Generation in American literature. He was the son of one of the richest banking families in New England, a Boston Brahmin, and the nephew of Jane Norton Grew, the wife of financier J. P. Morgan, Jr. As such, he was heir to a portion of a substantial family fortune. He was a volunteer in the American Field Service during World War I, and later served in the U.S. Ambulance Corps. He narrowly escaped with his life.

Profoundly affected by his experience in World War I, Crosby vowed to live life on his own terms and abandoned all pretense of living the expected life of a privileged Bostonian. In 1920 he met Mrs. Richard Peabody (née Mary Phelps Jacob), six years his senior. Their affair was the source of scandal and gossip among blue-blood Boston.

Mary (or Polly as she was called) divorced her alcoholic husband and to her family&#x27;s dismay married Crosby. Two days later they left for Europe, where they devoted themselves to art and poetry. Both enjoyed a decadent lifestyle, drinking, smoking opium regularly, traveling frequently, and having an open marriage. Crosby wrote and published poetry that dwelled on the symbolism of the sun and explored themes of death and suicide.

He numbered among his friends some of the most famous individuals of the early 20th century, including Salvador Dalí, Ernest Hemingway, and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Polly took the name Caresse, and Crosby and she founded the Black Sun Press. It was the first to publish works by several struggling authors who later became famous, including James Joyce, Kay Boyle, Ernest Hemingway, Hart Crane, D. H. Lawrence, and René Crevel. Crosby died in 1929 as part of a murder–suicide or suicide pact.

==Early life==
Crosby (born Henry Sturgis Crosby — his parents Stephen Van Rensslaer Crosby and Henrietta Marion Grew later changed his middle name to Grew) was born in Boston&#x27;s exclusive Back Bay neighborhood. He was the product of generations of blue-blood English and Dutch American families, descended from the Van Rensselaers, Schuylers, Morgans, and Grews. His uncle was J. Pierpont Morgan Jr., one of the richest men in America at that time. His father&#x27;s mother was the great-granddaughter of Peggy Schuyler, sister-in-law of Alexander Hamilton. Also among Harry&#x27;s ancestors were Revolutionary War General Philip Schuyler, and William Floyd, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.

He had one sister, Katherine Schuyler Crosby, nicknamed Kitsa, who was born in 1901. They moved shortly after his birth to an estate that had, among other things, a dance floor that could accommodate 150 people. His mother instilled in him a love for poetry. He tossed water bombs off the upper stories of the house onto unsuspecting guests. The family spent its summers on the North Shore of Massachusetts at a second home in Manchester, about from Boston. His religious, affectionate mother loved nature and was one of the founders of the Garden Club of America. His father, a banker, relived his days as a college football star through his Ivy League and Boston society connections.

As a child, he attended the exclusive Noble and Greenough School. In 1913, when he was 14 years old, his parents decided it was time to send him to the leading Massachusetts prep school, St. Mark&#x27;s, from which he graduated in 1917.

==World War I==


At age 19, like many young men of upper-crust American society, Crosby volunteered to serve in the American Ambulance Service in France. Writers whose works he later published also served in the ambulance corps, including Ernest Hemingway and Malcolm Cowley. He arrived in France on July 7, 1917.

When America officially entered the War, the American Ambulance Service corps was integrated into the U. S. Army Ambulance Corps and Crosby enlisted. During the Battle of Verdun, he was very close to the front, and ferried wounded soldiers from the front lines to rear areas for three days without relief. On November 22, 1917, as Crosby and his best friend, Way &quot;Spud&quot; Spaulding, and another friend, Ben Weeden, were transporting several wounded soldiers to a medical aid station, Crosby&#x27;s Ambulance 741 was hit by an artillery shell that landed away, sending shrapnel ripping through the vehicle, completely destroying it. Miraculously, Crosby was unhurt, but Spaulding, following close behind in another ambulance, was struck in the chest by shrapnel. Crosby and Weeden were able to transport him to a hospital. After leaving Spaulding at the hospital in Beaulieu and returning to the aid station, Crosby was seen running in circles, lap after lap, without apparent purpose. Crosby declared later that that was the night he changed from a boy to a man. From that moment on, he never feared death. Spaulding was in intensive care for three months and was released from the hospital after six months.

Crosby wrote many letters home during the two years he was in France. Originally convinced that God had &quot;ordained the war&quot; to cleanse the world, his early reports home were good-spirited. Over time, however, he began to describe the horror of trench warfare and awful scenes of dead and dying soldiers.

On August 23–25, 1918, during a battle near Orme, his section (Section Sanitaire 641, attached to the 120th French Division) evacuated more than 2000 wounded and was cited for bravery in the field while under heavy German bombardment. Crosby became in 1919 one of the youngest Americans to be awarded the Croix de guerre. Harry was happy to finally have a medal to prove his valor and wrote home, &quot;Oh Boy!!!!!! won THE CROIX DE GUERRE. Thank God.&quot;

When the Armistice was signed, Crosby, like every other soldier, was anxious to go home, but waited for more than a month for orders. He wrote his mother, asking her to get &quot;Uncle Jack&quot; J.P. Morgan to intervene on his behalf. During the war, J.P. Morgan &amp; Company had loaned $1.5 billion dollars (about $ billion in today&#x27;s dollars) to the Allies to fight against the Germans. On March 21, 1919, Crosby left Brest for Boston via Philadelphia and arrived home a hero.

==Attends Harvard==
After returning from World War I, Crosby attended Harvard University in the spring of 1919 under an accelerated program for veterans. He took 19 courses, six in French (which he read and spoke fluently) and six in English literature. The remainder of his courses were in fine arts, music, Spanish, and social ethics. Taking his studies very lightly, he thought he was going to fail, and paid a knowledgeable man who was familiar with what questions would be asked on the examinations to tutor him. He graduated with a bachelor of arts in 1921.

He yearned, though, to escape the rigidity of everyday life in Boston. His experience in France made it unbearable to live among what he called &quot;dreary, drearier, dreariest Boston&quot; and to put up with &quot;Boston virgins who are brought up among sexless surroundings, who wear canvas drawers and flat-heeled shoes.&quot; He wanted to escape &quot;the horrors of Boston and particularly of Boston virgins.&quot; Any sense of propriety was wiped out by a lust for living in the moment, forgetting all risks and possible consequences.

==Meets Mrs. Richard Peabody==
Crosby&#x27;s mother invited Mrs. Richard Rogers Peabody (née Mary Phelps Jacob) to chaperone Crosby and some of his friends at a picnic on July 4, 1920, including dinner and a trip to the amusement park at Nantasket Beach. During dinner, Crosby never spoke to the girl on his left, breaking decorum. By some accounts, Crosby fell in love with the buxom Mrs. Peabody in about two hours, confessing his love for her in the Tunnel of Love at the amusement park. Two weeks later, they went to church together in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts and spent the night together. Their public relationship was a scandal among blue-blood Boston.

She was 28, six years older than Crosby, with two small children, and married. No matter what Crosby tried, Polly would not divorce Richard and marry him. Crosby took a job in Boston at the Shawmut National Bank, a job he disliked, and took the train to visit Polly in New York. In May 1921, when Polly would not respond to his demands, Crosby threatened suicide if Polly did not marry him. Polly&#x27;s husband Richard Peabody was in and out of sanatoriums several times fighting alcoholism. In June 1921, she formally separated from him. Later that winter, Polly accepted weekend visits from Crosby, who took the midnight train home to Boston afterward. In December, Polly&#x27;s husband Richard offered to divorce her, and in February 1922, their marriage was legally ended.
After eight months at the Shawmut National Bank, Crosby got drunk for six days and resigned on March 14, 1922. Crosby&#x27;s uncle, J. P. Morgan, Jr., agreed to provide a position for Crosby in Paris at Morgan, Harjes et Cie. Crosby already spoke and read fluent French and moved to Paris in May. Polly preceded him there, but returned to the United States in July, angry and jealous. On September 2, 1922, Crosby proposed to Polly via transatlantic cable, and the next day bribed his way aboard the &quot;Aquitania&quot; for New York, which made a weekly six-day express run to New York.

===Polly and Harry marry===
On September 9, 1922, Crosby and Polly were married in the Municipal Building in New York City, and two days later they reboarded the RMS &quot;Aquitania&quot; and moved with her children to Paris. There, they joined the Lost Generation of expatriate Americans disillusioned by the loss of life in World War I and the moral and social values of their parents&#x27; generation. Crosby continued his work at Morgan, Harjes et Cie, the Morgan family&#x27;s bank in Paris. They found an apartment at 12, Quai d&#x27;Orléans overlooking the Seine, on the exclusive Île Saint-Louis, and Polly donned her red bathing suit and row Crosby down the Seine in his dark business suit, formal hat, umbrella, and briefcase to the Place de la Concorde, where he walked the last few blocks to the bank on Place Vendôme. As she rowed back home, Polly, who was well endowed, enjoyed whistles, jeers, and waves from workmen. She said the exercise was good for her breasts.

After their first year in Paris, Polly shipped her children off to boarding schools in Gstaad. At the end of 1923, Crosby quit Morgan, Harjes et Cie and devoted himself to the life of a poet, and later, publisher.

=== Life as expatriates ===
Both of them were attracted to the bohemian lifestyle of the artists gathering in Montparnasse. Even by the wild standards of Paris in the 1920s, Crosby was in a league of his own. The couple lived a hedonistic and decadent life, including an open marriage and numerous affairs. They drank &quot;oceans of champagne&quot; and used opium, cocaine, and hashish. They wrote a mutual suicide pact and carried cremation instructions with them.

Polly and Crosby purchased their first race horse in June 1924, and then two more in April 1925. At the end of 1924, Crosby persuaded Polly to formally change her first name to Caresse, as he felt Polly was too prim and proper for his wife. They briefly considered Clytoris before deciding on Caresse. Crosby suggesting that her new name &quot;begin with a C to go with Crosby and it must form a cross with mine.&quot; The two names intersected at right angles at the common &quot;R,&quot; &quot;the Crosby cross.&quot;

In 1924, they rented an apartment in the Faubourg St. Germain for six months from Princess Marthe Bibesco, a friend of Crosby&#x27;s cousin Walter Berry, for 50,000 francs (the equivalent of $2,200, about $ in today&#x27;s dollars). When they moved in, they brought with them &quot;two maids and a cook, a governess, and a chauffeur.&quot;

His inheritance, multiplied by the favorable exchange rate the American dollar enjoyed in postwar Europe, allowed them to indulge in an extravagant expatriate lifestyle. Crosby&#x27;s trust fund provided them with US$12,000 per year (or $ in today&#x27;s dollars). Still, Crosby repeatedly overdrew his account at State Street Trust in Boston and at Morgan, Harjes, in Paris.

During 1929, Crosby wired his father, an investment banker, several times asking him to put more money from his inheritance into his account. In January, he asked his father to sell $4,000 ($ today) worth &quot;to make up for past extravagances in New York&quot; In May, he noted in his diary that he had sold another $4,000 worth of stock &quot;to enjoy life when you can&quot;. In mid-July, drunk on sherry cobblers, he sent a cable to his father, who was not pleased by it:
His father complied, but not without rebuking his son for his spendthrift ways.

===Lifestyle===
The couple became known for hosting small dinner parties from their giant bed in their palatial townhouse on Île Saint-Louis, and afterward everyone was invited to enjoy their huge bathtub together, taking advantage of iced bottles of champagne near at hand.

They took extended traveling tours. In January 1925, they traveled to North Africa, where they first smoked opium, a habit to which they returned often. Crosby had tattoos on the soles of his feet—a cross on one and a pagan sun symbol on the other.

On November 19, 1925, Crosby and Polly rented a fashionable apartment on 19, Rue de Lille, where they remained for the rest of their time in Paris.

Crosby developed an obsessive fascination with imagery centering on the sun. His poetry and journals often focused on the sun, a symbol to him of perfection, enthusiasm, freedom, heat, and destruction. Crosby claimed to be a &quot;sun worshiper in love with death.&quot; He often added a doodle of a &quot;black sun&quot; to his signature which also included an arrow, jutting upward from the &quot;y&quot; in Crosby&#x27;s last name and aiming toward the center of the sun&#x27;s circle: &quot;a phallic thrust received by a welcoming erogenous zone.&quot;

Crosby met Ernest Hemingway on a skiing trip to Gstaad in 1926. In July 1927, Crosby and Hemingway visited Pamplona for the running of the bulls. Crosby wrote of Hemingway that &quot;H. could drink us under the table.&quot; Harry and Caresse published the Paris edition of Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Torrents of Spring&quot;. In early 1928, they traveled to the Middle East, visiting several countries.

In late 1928, they secured a 20-year lease on a medieval mill outside of Paris in Ermenonville for living quarters, which they named Le Moulin du Soleil (&quot;The Mill of the Sun&quot;). It had three old stone buildings, no electricity or telephone, and a single bathroom. The Crosbys added a racing course on which to play donkey polo and a small swimming pool. The millstream had slowed to a trickle. Inside the mill, Caresse converted the old washrooms and cellars into a large kitchen. The ground floor of the central mill tower served as a dining room, where guests sat on logs cut from the neighboring woods. The mill also contained a solid brass marine cannon that was rolled out for special guests, who were announced with a loud report. A whitewashed wall near the stairway served as a guest book. It was signed by many guests who included D. H. Lawrence, Douglas Fairbanks, the future George VI, and Eva Braun, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s future wife.

They hosted wild parties at the mill, including drunken polo on donkeys, and entertained famous guests such as Salvador Dalí. Henry wrote in his journal:

Crosby spent hours sunbathing naked atop the mill&#x27;s turret. Contrary to fashion of the day, he did not wear a hat. He often wore a black carnation in his lapel, and was known to color his finger- and toenails. Crosby once hired four horse-drawn carriages and raced them through the Paris streets. They frequently dropped in at Drosso where they smoked opium.

Crosby experimented with photography and saw the medium as a viable art form before it was widely accepted as such. In 1929, he met Henri Cartier-Bresson in Le Bourget, where Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s air squadron commandant had placed him under house arrest for hunting without a license. Crosby persuaded the officer to release Cartier-Bresson into his custody for a few days. The two men had an interest in photography, and Henry presented Henri with his first camera. They spent their time together taking and printing pictures at Crosby&#x27;s home, Le Moulin du Soleil. Cartier-Bresson was attracted to Caresse and began a sexual relationship with her that lasted until 1931, two years after Harry&#x27;s suicide.

Crosby also learned to fly solo in November 1929, when the aeroplane was so new that its spelling had not been agreed upon.

===Extra-marital relationships===

In 1923, shortly after their arrival in Paris, Caresse introduced Crosby to her friend Constance Crowninshield Coolidge, also a Boston Brahmin, an American expatriate. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance did not care what others thought about her. She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. Crosby nicknamed her the &quot;Lady of the Golden Horse&quot;. She began a sexual relationship with Crosby that continued for several months. Harry rationalized their affair, telling Constance &quot;One should follow every instinct no matter where it leads.&quot; But Crosby would not leave Caresse nor did Constance ask this of him. When Constance received a letter from Caresse who confessed that her affair with her husband had made her &quot;very miserable&quot;, Constance wrote Harry and told him she would not see him any more. Harry was devastated by her decision. &quot;Your letter was bar none the worst blow I have ever received...I wouldn&#x27;t leave her under any circumstances nor as you say would you ever marry me.&quot; The three remained close friends, and on October 1, 1924, Constance married the Count Pierre de Jumilhac, although the marriage lasted only five years.

Harry and Caresse decided on an open marriage and had several lovers. He became legendary for his seductive abilities in some social circles in Paris, maintaining relationships with a variety of beautiful and doting young women.

Their wildness was in full flower during the drunken orgies of the annual Four Arts Balls (&quot;Bal des Quatz&#x27; Arts&quot;). In July 1927, he turned 10 live snakes loose on the dance floor. He wrote in his diary about it later:

One year, Caresse arrived topless riding a baby elephant and wearing a turquoise wig. The motif for the ball that year was Inca, and Crosby dressed for the occasion, covering himself in red ochre and wearing nothing but a loincloth and a necklace of dead pigeons.

Embracing the open sexuality offered by Crosby and his wife Caresse, Henri Cartier-Bresson fell into an intense sexual relationship with her that lasted until 1931.

== Black Sun Press ==
 
In April, 1927, they founded an English language publishing company, first titled &quot;Éditions Narcisse&quot;, after their black whippet Narcisse Noir. They used the press as an avenue to publish their own poetry in small editions of finely made hardbound volumes.

They printed, on high-quality paper, limited quantities of meticulously produced, hand-manufactured books. Publishing in Paris during the 1920s and 1930s put the company at the crossroads for many American writers who were living abroad. In 1928, as &quot;Éditions Narcisse&quot;, they printed a limited edition of 300 numbered copies of &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe with illustrations by Alastair.

In 1928, they found they enjoyed the reception their initial works received, and decided to expand the press to serve other authors, renaming the company the Black Sun Press, following on Crosby&#x27;s obsession on the symbolism of the sun. They rapidly gained notice for publishing beautifully bound, typographically flawless editions of unusual books. They took exquisite care with the books they published, choosing the finest papers and inks.

They published early works of several writers before they were well known, including James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Tales Told of Shem and Shaun&quot; (which was later integrated into &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;). They published Kay Boyle&#x27;s first book-length work, &quot;Short Stories&quot;, in 1929. and works by Hart Crane, D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, Archibald MacLeish, Ernest Hemingway, Laurence Sterne, and Eugene Jolas. The Black Sun Press evolved into one of the most important small presses in Paris in the 1920s. After Crosby died in a suicide pact with one of his many lovers, Caresse Crosby continued publishing into the 1940s.

==The Fire Princess==
On July 9, 1928, Crosby met 20-year-old Josephine Noyes Rotch, the daughter of Arthur and Helen Ludington Rotch of Boston. Ten years his junior, Josephine was shopping in Venice at the Lido for her wedding dress. She had belonged to the Vincent Club and the Junior League and graduated from Lee School before she had attended Bryn Mawr College. After only two years at Bryn Mawr, she left because she planned to marry Albert Bigelow. &quot;She was dark and intense...since the season of her coming out in 1926-1927, she had been known around Boston as fast, a &#x27;bad egg&#x27;...with a good deal of sex appeal.&quot;

They met for sex as often as her eight days in Venice would allow. He later called her the &quot;Youngest Princess of the Sun&quot; and the &quot;Fire Princess&quot;. She was also from a prominent Boston family which first settled in Provincetown, Massachusetts in 1690. Josephine inspired Crosby&#x27;s next collection of poems, which he dedicated to her, titled &quot;Transit of Venus.&quot; In a letter dated July 24, 1928, Crosby detailed the affair to his mother, in whom he had always confided:

Josephine and Crosby had an ongoing affair until June 21, 1929, when she married Albert Smith Bigelow. Their affair was over—until August, when Josephine contacted Crosby and they rekindled the affair as her husband became a first- year graduate student of architecture at Harvard. Unlike his wife Caresse, Josephine was quarrelsome and prone to fits of jealousy. She bombarded Crosby with half-incoherent cables and letters, anxious to set the date for their next tryst.

===Visit to United States===
On November 20, 1929, the Crosbys returned to the United States aboard the RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot; for a visit and the Harvard-Yale football game. Crosby and Josephine met and traveled to Detroit, where they checked into the expensive ($12 a day—about $ today) Book-Cadillac Hotel as Mr. and Mrs Harry Crane. For four days, they took meals in their room, smoked opium, and had sex.

On December 7, 1929, the lovers returned to New York, where Josephine said she was going to return to Boston and her husband. Crosby&#x27;s friend Hart Crane threw a party that evening to celebrate his completion after seven years of his poem, &quot;The Bridge&quot;. The Black Sun Press was scheduled to publish it the next week, and he wanted to bid Crosby and Caresse &quot;bon voyage&quot;, since they were due to sail back to France the next week. Among the guests present were Margaret Robson, Malcolm Cowley, Walker Evans, E. E. Cummings, and William Carlos Williams. The party went on until nearly dawn. Crosby and Caresse made plans to see Crane again before they left for Europe on December 10 to attend the popular Broadway play &quot;Berkeley Square&quot;.

On December 9, Josephine, who instead of returning to Boston, had stayed with one of her bridesmaids in New York, sent a 36-line poem to Harry Crosby, who was staying with Caresse at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel. The last line of the poem read &quot;Death is our marriage&quot;.

On the same day, Harry Crosby wrote his final entry in his journal: &quot;One is not in love unless one desires to die with one&#x27;s beloved. There is only one happiness it is to love and to be loved.&quot;

==Murder and suicide==

On the evening of the play, December 10, 1929, Caresse, Crosby&#x27;s mother Henrietta Grew, and Hart Crane met for dinner before the play, but Crosby did not show up, which was uncharacteristic of him as it was not like him to needlessly cause Caresse to worry. She called their friend Stanley Mortimer at his mother&#x27;s apartment, whose studio Crosby was known to use for his trysts. He agreed to check his studio. Mortimer had to enlist help to break open the locked door and found Crosby and Josephine&#x27;s bodies. Crosby was in bed with a .25 calibre bullet hole in his right temple next to Josephine, who had a matching hole in her left temple, in what appeared to be a suicide pact. Crosby was still clutching the Belgian automatic pistol in one hand, Josephine in the other.

The steamship tickets he had bought that morning for the return to Europe with Caresse were in his pocket. The coroner also found in his pocket a cable from Josephine addressed to Crosby on the RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot;. The coroner reported that Crosby&#x27;s toenails were painted red, and that he had a Christian cross tattooed on the sole of one foot and a pagan icon representing the sun on the other.

Crosby&#x27;s wedding ring was found crushed on the floor, not on his finger, where he always promised Caresse it would remain. Caresse refused to witness the carnage and begged Archibald MacLeish, who was in town from his farm, to take charge. While waiting for the doctors to finish their examination, MacLeish wondered if Crosby&#x27;s literary aspirations had not contributed to his death.

Crosby&#x27;s suicide, along with Hart Crane&#x27;s suicide two and a half years later, were cited by later writers as emblematic of the Lost Generation.

===Scandal follows===
The next day, the headlines revealed all: &quot;Tragedy and Disgrace.&quot; There was no suicide note, and newspapers ran sensational articles for many days about the murder or suicide pact—they could not decide which. &quot;The New York Times&quot; front page blared, &quot;COUPLE SHOT DEAD IN ARTISTS&#x27; HOTEL; Suicide Compact Is Indicated Between Henry Grew Crosby and Harvard Man&#x27;s Wife. BUT MOTIVE IS UNKNOWN. He Was Socially Prominent in Boston—Bodies Found in Friend&#x27;s Suite.&quot; The New York newspapers decided it was a murder-suicide.

Gretchen Powell had lunch with Crosby the day of his death. Her memory of the luncheon supported the notion that Josephine was one of Crosby&#x27;s many passing fancies. She related that Crosby had told her, &quot;the Rotch girl was pestering him; he was exasperated; she had threatened to kill herself in the lobby of the Savoy-Plaza if he didn&#x27;t meet her at once.&quot;

The deaths polarized the several prominent families affected. The Rotch family considered Josephine&#x27;s death to be murder. Josephine&#x27;s erstwhile husband Albert Bigelow blamed Crosby for &quot;seducing his wife and murdering her because he couldn&#x27;t have her.&quot;

Crosby&#x27;s poetry possibly gave the best clue to his motives. Death was &quot;the hand that opens the door to our cage the home we instinctively fly to.&quot; His death mortified proper society. Crosby&#x27;s biographer Geoffrey Wolff wrote, &quot;He had meant to do it; it was no mistake; it was not a joke. If anything of Harry Crosby commands respect, perhaps even awe, it was the unswerving character of his intention.&quot; Crosby&#x27;s death, given the macabre circumstances under which it occurred, scandalized Boston&#x27;s Back Bay society.

==Legacy==
Crosby as a poet was never more than a minor literary figure while he lived, and was remembered more for his scandalous suicide over his creative efforts. He has greater importance as a co-founder of the Black Sun Press, which Caresse continued to operate after his death. She also established, with Jacques Porel, a side venture, Crosby Continental Editions, that published paperback books by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, and Dorothy Parker, among others. The paperback books did not sell well, and Crosby Continental closed in 1933. The Black Sun Press, however, continued publishing into the 1950s. The Black Sun Press produced finely crafted books in small editions, including works by, among others, D. H. Lawrence, Archibald MacLeish, James Joyce, Kay Boyle, and Hart Crane.

Crosby&#x27;s friend Crane committed suicide less than two years later. Malcolm Cowley, whom Crosby had published, wrote in his 1934 book &quot;Exile&#x27;s Return&quot;, that the death of &quot;Harry Crosby becomes a symbol&quot; of the rise and fall of the Jazz Age. He recited the excesses typified by Crosby&#x27;s extravagant lifestyle as evidence of the shallowness of society during that era. When he edited and reissued the book in 1951, he softened his opinion of Crosby somewhat. &quot;I had written at length about the life of Harry Crosby, who I scarcely know,&quot; he wrote, &quot;in order to avoid discussing the more recent death of Hart Crane, whom I know so well that I couldn&#x27;t bear to write about him.&quot;

In 1931, Caresse also published &quot;Torchbearer&quot;, a collection of his poetry with an afterword by Ezra Pound, and &quot;Aphrodite in Flight&quot;, a 75-paragraph-long prose-poem and how-to manual for lovers that compared making love to a woman to flying planes. Caresse published a boxed set of Crosby&#x27;s work titled &quot;Collected poems of Harry Crosby&quot; containing &quot;Chariot of the Sun&quot; with D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s introduction, &quot;Transit of Venus&quot; with T. S. Eliot&#x27;s introduction, &quot;Sleeping Together&quot; with Stuart Gilbert&#x27;s introduction, and &quot;Torchbearer&quot; in 1931. It was hand-set in dorique type; only 50 copies were printed.

During 1931 and 1932, Caresse collaborated with Harry&#x27;s mother Henrietta to publish letters he had written to his family while serving in France from the summer of 1917 until he returned home in 1919. Henrietta added a chronology and brief preface to the letters. The book &quot;War Letters&quot; was published in a unnumbered edition of 125 copies. , a leather-bound edition of the book was priced from $2,000 to $3,500.

Caresse Crosby edited and published Crosby&#x27;s diaries and papers. She wrote and published &quot;Poems for Harry Crosby&quot; in 1931. She also published and translated some of the works of Hemingway, Faulkner, and Dorothy Parker, among others. The Black Sun Press enjoyed the greatest longevity among the several expatriate presses founded in Paris during the 1920s. Through 1936, it published nearly three times as many titles as did Edward Titus through his Black Manikin Press.

Books printed by the Black Sun Press are valued by collectors. Each book was hand-designed, beautifully printed, and illustrated with elegant typeface. A rare volume published by the Black Sun Press of Hart Crane&#x27;s book-length poem &quot;The Bridge&quot;, including photos by Walker Evans, was sold by Christie&#x27;s in 2009 for US$21,250. In 2009, Neil Pearson, an antiquarian books expert, said &quot;A Black Sun book is the literary equivalent of a Braque or a Picasso painting—except it&#x27;s a few thousand pounds, not 20 million.&quot;

&quot;Ladders to the Sun: Poems by Harry Crosby&quot;, a collection of Harry Crosby&#x27;s poetry, was published by Soul Bay Press in April 2010.

In 2004, Fine Line Features optioned Andrea Berloff&#x27;s first screenplay &quot;Harry and Caresse.&quot; Lasse Hallström was initially attached to direct and Leslie Holleran was attached as a producer.

<doc id="179533" wikidata="Q2843964" url="?curid=179533" title="Eric Stenbock">
<text>Count Eric Stanislaus (or Stanislaus Eric) Stenbock ( – ) was a Baltic Swedish poet and writer of macabre fantastic fiction.

==Life==
Stenbock was the count of Bogesund and the heir to an estate near Kolga in Estonia. He was the son of Lucy Sophia Frerichs, the daughter and heiress of Johann Andreas Frerichs, a Manchester cotton tycoon, and Count Erich Stenbock, of a distinguished Swedish noble family of the Baltic German House of nobility in Reval. The family rose to prominence in the service of King Gustav Vasa: Catherine Stenbock was the third and last consort of Gustav Vasa and Queen consort of Sweden between 1552 and 1560. Stenbock&#x27;s great-grandfather was Baron Friedrich von Stuart (1761–1842) from Courland. Immanuel Kant was a great-great-granduncle of Stenbock.

Stenbock&#x27;s father died suddenly while he was one year old; his properties were held in trust for him by his grandfather Magnus. Eric&#x27;s maternal grandfather died while Eric was quite young, also, in 1866, leaving him another trust fund.

Stenbock attended Balliol College in Oxford but never completed his studies. While at Oxford, Eric was deeply influenced by the homosexual Pre-Raphaelite artist and illustrator Simeon Solomon. He is also said to have had a relationship with the composer and conductor Norman O&#x27;Neill and with other &quot;young men&quot;.

In Oxford, Stenbock also converted to Roman Catholicism taking for himself the name Stanislaus. Some years later Eric also admitted to having tried a different religion every week in Oxford. At the end of his life, he seemed to have developed a syncretist religion containing elements of Catholicism, Buddhism and idolatry.

In 1885 Count Magnus died, upon which Stenbock, as the oldest living male relative, acceded to the status of Count and to the possession of the family&#x27;s estates in Estonia. Eric traveled to and lived in Kolga for a year and a half; he returned to England in the summer of 1887, during which time he sank deeper into alcoholism and drug addiction.

Stenbock behaved eccentrically. He kept snakes, lizards, salamanders and toads in his room, and had a &quot;zoo&quot; in his garden containing a reindeer, a fox, and a bear. When he traveled, he invariably brought with him a dog, a monkey, and a life-sized doll. This doll he referred to as &quot;le Petit Comte&quot; (&quot;the little Count&quot;) and told everyone that it was his son; he insisted it be brought to him daily, and—when it was absent—he asked about its health. (Stenbock&#x27;s family believed an unscrupulous Jesuit had been given large amounts of money by the Count for the &quot;education&quot; of this doll.)

==Work==
Stenbock lived in England most of his life, and wrote his works in the English language. He published a number of books of verse during his lifetime, including &quot;Love, Sleep, and Dreams&quot;, 1881, and &quot;Rue, Myrtle, and Cypress&quot; (1883). In 1894, Stenbock published &quot;The Shadow of Death&quot;, his last volume of verse, and &quot;Studies of Death&quot;, a collection of short stories.

==Death==
On 26 April 1895 Stenbock died from cirrhosis of the liver at his mother&#x27;s home, Withdeane Hall, near Brighton; his death went unnoticed in the press, aside from a brief mention in &quot;The Times&quot; (30 April 1895). Stenbock had named More Adey as his literary executor. On 1 May the burial service was held in the Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The band Current 93 made an album of the same name of incidental music inspired by Stenbock&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; story. Stenbock&#x27;s legacy is supported by the invitation-only Stenbock Society, notable like Stenbock himself for its infrequent activity.

Marc Almond and Michael Cashmore released the two-track CD &quot;Gabriel &amp; The Lunatic Lover&quot; in 2008 with two songs based on Stenbock&#x27;s poems by the same name. This was followed in 2011 by the album &quot;Feasting with Panthers&quot; which included two more adaptations, &quot;Sonnet XI&quot; and &quot;The Song of the Unwept Tear&quot;. All four poems were adapted and translated by Jeremy Reed.

Strange Attractor Press published a collection of Stenbock&#x27;s short stories, poems, and essays, &quot;Of Kings and Things&quot; in 2019.

<doc id="179548" wikidata="Q5455798" url="?curid=179548" title="Five-pin bowling">
<text>Five-pin bowling is a bowling variant which is played in Canada, where many bowling alleys offer it, either alone or in combination with ten-pin bowling. It was devised around 1909 by Thomas F. Ryan in Toronto, Ontario, at his Toronto Bowling Club, in response to customers who complained that the ten-pin game was too strenuous. He cut five tenpins down to about 75% of their size, and used hand-sized hard rubber balls, thus inventing the original version of five-pin bowling.

== Gameplay ==

The balls in five pin bowling are small enough to fit in the hand and therefore typically have no fingerholes, although the Canadian 5 Pin Bowlers Association (C5PBA) has approved balls with thumb holes.

At the end of the lane there are five pins arranged in a V. They are midway in size between duckpins and ten pins, and they have a heavy rubber band around their middles to make them move farther when struck. 

Unlike any other form of bowling popular in North America, the pins in five-pin bowling are worth different scoring point values, depending on their location in the V-formation. The centre pin is worth five points if knocked down, those on either side, three each, and the outermost pins, two each, giving a total of 15 in each frame.

In each frame, each player gets three attempts to knock all five pins over. Knocking all five pins down with the first ball is a strike, worth 15 points, plus the score achieved by the player&#x27;s first two balls of the next frame are added to the score for the strike; the count in the frame where the first strike was bowled is left blank until the bowler makes their first delivery of the next frame. As those points are also counted in their own frame, in effect they count double. A player who takes two balls to knock all the pins down gets a spare, which means the first ball of the next frame counts double. When a bowler bowls two strikes in succession, within a game, the bowler has scored a &quot;double&quot;. When a double has been bowled, the count for the first strike is 30 points plus the value of the pins bowled down with the first ball of the frame following the second strike. When a bowler bowls three strikes in succession, within a game, the bowler has scored a &quot;triple&quot; (also called a &quot;turkey&quot;). In scoring three successive strikes, the bowler is credited with 45 points in the frame where the first strike was bowled. As in ten-pin, if either of these happen in the last frame, the player gets to take one or two shots at a re-racked set of pins immediately.
A perfect score is 450, requiring 12 consecutive strikes bowled in the same game without fouling. It does not happen as frequently as in tenpin bowling. The C5PBA sanctions from 15 to 30 perfect games annually.

Originally the pins counted as (from left to right) 4 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 5 points. In 1952 the president of the Canadian Bowling Association proposed changing the scoring system to 2 - 3 - 5 - 3 - 2. That was accepted in the west in 1952, in Ontario in 1953, and in the rest of Canada in 1954.

In 1967 the Canadian Bowling Congress decided to abolish the counter pin (the left counter pin had to be knocked down to score any points). The counter pin was the right 2-pin for left-handed bowlers. The rule change went in effect in 1968 in eastern Canada, but the Western Canada 5-pin Bowling Association rejected the change, and as a result there were no national championships until 1972 after the west accepted abolishing the counter pin. (Although some leagues continued with the counter pin system for several more years.)

Five-pin bowling allows for more strategy in its play than the ten-pin variant, because of the differing point values for each pin. For example: If a player fails to score a strike in 10-pin bowling, it is less important how the player chooses to resolve the remaining pins, as all pins are valued the same, and knocking down more results in higher points. In five-pin bowling on the other hand, if a player misses a strike, he or she has to make a strategic decision as to which set of remaining pins they should attempt to knock down (beyond simply trying for them all), which allows players a means to minimize their losses after a mistake, by aiming for the higher-scoring group of pins, or for the lower but perhaps more easily struck group.

=== Terminology ===
Five-pin bowlers use a number of terms to denote the results of a throw:

* &quot;[number]-pack&quot;: Term for a number of consecutive strikes; e.g. six consecutive strikes is a &quot;six-pack&quot;. Also referred to as &quot;[number]-bagger&quot; (e.g. six-bagger).
* &quot;10 the hard way&quot;: After the third ball, having a frame score of 10 where the remaining pins are a 3-pin and a 2-pin that are not &quot;neighbours&quot;.
* &quot;Aces&quot; (A): taking out the headpin and both three pins but leaving the two corner pins. Also referred to as &quot;bed posts&quot;, &quot;goal posts&quot; or &quot;channel 11&quot;.
* &quot;Chop&quot; or &quot;chop-off&quot; (denoted &quot;c/o&quot;): Hitting the headpin and the 3 and 2 pins on one side on the first ball, leaving the other 3 and 2 pins on the other side.
* &quot;Clean game&quot;: Finishing a game with a strike or spare in every frame.
* &quot;Corner-pin&quot;: Leaving only the left corner pin or right corner pin standing on the first ball is denoted by an &quot;L&quot; or an &quot;R&quot; respectively on a score sheet.
* &quot;Fifteen&quot;: When all pins are knocked down after the third ball. Also referred to as a &quot;clean up&quot;.
* &quot;Headpin&quot; (denoted H on a score sheet): punching out the headpin on the first ball. This is the most dreaded result on the first ball, as converting the spare resulting from punching out the headpin (a &quot;headpin-spare&quot;) is extremely difficult to achieve.
* &quot;Punch&quot;: Hitting only one pin when two or more pins are remaining (commonly known as a &quot;cherry&quot; on the 2nd or 3rd ball)
* &quot;Split&quot; (S): Taking out the headpin and one of the three-pins, scoring 8 on the first ball. Difficult to obtain a spare on the second ball but if accomplished, this is known as a &quot;split-spare&quot;. Many bowling associations will offer a special pin for this achievement.
* &quot;Strike out&quot;: Finishing the game with Three or more strikes.
* &quot;Turkey&quot;: Three consecutive strikes
* &quot;Wood&quot; or &quot;deadwood&quot;: The pins left on the lane, usually after throwing the first two balls of a frame. This originates from when bowling pins were typically made of wood and not acrylic.

== Major tournaments ==

There are four groups overseeing the major tournaments in five pin bowling.
*Canadian Five Pin Bowler&#x27;s Association (C5PBA): The C5PBA is the body that governs the rules and regulations of the game. The C5PBA operates three major national tournaments. The showcase tournament is the &quot;Open&quot;, a scratch tournament that involves both teams and singles. The national finals of the Open span three to four days and culminate with a stepladder format to determine national champions in men&#x27;s singles, women&#x27;s singles, men&#x27;s teams, women&#x27;s teams, and mixed teams. There is a second tournament known as The Youth Challenge, which is shorter than the Open in length, but involves a similar format to the Open, this tournament is for youth bowlers between the ages of 12 and 19. The Inter-Provincial, which replaced the High Low Doubles, became a national event in 2008 and is a pins over average (POA) team format.
*Bowl Canada: Bowl Canada is the body that represents the bowling centre owners. The organization previously operated under Bowling Proprietors Association of Canada (BPAC). Bowl Canada oversees Youth Bowling Canada (YBC) and Club 55+ (formerly the Golden Age Bowler&#x27;s Club). Both organizations feature national championships. The YBC national championship is known as the &quot;Four Steps to Stardom&quot; while the Club 55+ national championship is known as the &quot;Team Triples&quot;. Bowl Canada also runs the National Classified Championships, a scratch tournament where bowlers are qualify through their bowling centre within average categories. In 2016, the National Classified was replaced with a handicap-format tournament known as the Bowl Canada Cup while the Team Triples was updated to a four-person handicap-format team known as the &quot;Club 55+ Cup&quot;. Bowl Canada runs the Canadian qualifying for the AMF World Cup and the various five-pin TV shows such as CBC&#x27;s &quot;Championship Five Pin Bowling&quot; and the &quot;TSN Pins Game&quot;. In 2006, the CBC series and the TSN series were consolidated into one tournament, the Canadian Bowling Championships. As of 2009, TSN dropped the Canadian Bowling Championships from its televised schedule.
*The Master Bowlers Association of Canada: The MBAC is a unique organization that serves as the technical branch of the sport and provides a single national championship with both total pinfall (Tournament division) and pins over average (Teaching Division) divisions. A third branch of this organization involves the Seniors Division (over 55yrs). Typically the Teaching and Senior Division bowlers hold mid- to lower-range bowling averages. Bowlers in the Teaching Division are required to serve as coaches in YBC. The Master Bowlers operate under a strict dress code including a standard shirt in the provincial colours with the bowler&#x27;s name embroidered on the back.
*The Western Canadian Bowling Tour has grown in size and now has five major cash tournaments. The &#x27;Autumn Open is held in Calgary, Alberta at Paradise Lanes. The TPC at Sherwood is at Sherwood Bowl in Sherwood Park, Alberta. Joining the WCBT in 2022 was the Manitoba Open, which is played at St. James Lanes in Winnipeg. The Regina Classic is played at the Golden Mile Bowling Center in Regina, Saskatchewan. The Heritage Traditional is played in Red Deer, Alberta at Heritage Lanes. The season is now capped off by the WCBTour Championship in August, where the Top 12 players with membership for the season go and compete in a filmed tournament to determine the Tour Champion.

Qualifying for a national championship usually requires three qualifying rounds.

* League, House or Centre round: for most provinces, this is usually not required for the C5PBA Open or C5PBA Youth Challenge.
* Zone round: the number of centres in each zone varies, but the zones are set up geographically. In some provinces and tournaments, the zone round may be bypassed.
* Provincial championships: the winners of the zone round qualify for the provincial finals. For most tournaments, Ontario runs two provincial finals—a north provincial (Northern Ontario) and a south provincial (Ontario).

Each province also offers a number of tournaments that conclude with the provincial finals. The tournaments, formats and prize offerings vary by province. These tournaments are operated through the Provincial Bowling Proprietors Association, local and provincial five pin associations, and individual bowling centres.

== Facts and figures ==

* At first, bowling pins used in five-pin were made of plastic-coated maple. Today&#x27;s pins are made of a hard plastic and often feature UV-glow capability for black light glow bowling operations. The pin makes a &quot;clack&quot; sound when hit by the ball. The base of the plastic pin can be separated from the rest of the pin. The neck stripes on plastic pins are actually a red plastic tape that wears off with use and can be replaced. In 2011, the C5PBA approved a new pin base. The new base adds 1/8 inch of height to the pin, raises the pin&#x27;s center of gravity, and lowers the contact area with the lane. This new base has a dark color, so pins with the new base may appear to the bowler as floating above the lane.
* In 1990, the Canadian 5 Pin Bowlers Association sanctioned the use of personalized bowling balls. Before then, only bowling balls supplied by the bowling centre were allowed to be used.
* Many five pin tournaments scored by handicap usually use a scoring basis of &quot;pins over average&quot;, which is the difference between the outcome of a game and the bowler&#x27;s established average. It accumulates over the number of games bowled. This statistic can be negative.
* Modern automatic scoring systems (including Steltronic, Brunswick Sync and QubicaAMF BES X) are certified for five-pin. On most string type pinsetters, automatic scoring equipment is connected directly to the pinsetter circuitry. Scoring cameras can be used on both types of pinsetting installations. Most systems mount the camera between lanes as in tenpin; however the ProScore system—when installed on free-fall—reads scores using a set of five electronic eyes mounted above the pindeck.
* Bowling centres with convertible pinsetters usually will set specific hours as to when their convertible lanes will support five-pin or ten-pin. Convertible machines may support duckpin bowling instead of ten-pin when in ten-pin mode. Only certain models of string pinsetters have been sanctioned by the USBC for ten-pin play.
* Some five-pin centres have installed lane protection devices. The device is a sheet of plexiglas mounted vertically about six inches (15 cm) above the lane and is located just past the target arrows on the lane. This device discourages bowlers from lofting the ball and damaging the lane—which is more prevalent in small ball bowling. A ball that knocks the plexiglas loose or flies over the plexiglas guard is worth zero points under C5PBA rules.
* A foul line violation in five-pin results in a 15-point penalty. Pins knocked over during a violating delivery count. The penalty is assessed at the end of the game. This compares to a zero score for the ball in other bowling disciplines.
* Some believe that the hockey term &quot;five-hole&quot; (the space between the goaltender&#x27;s legs) is taken from five-pin bowling. Knocking out the headpin (worth 5 points) by itself leaves a large hole through which it is easy to put the next one or two balls without hitting anything.
* Five-pin bowling is played in all Canadian provinces and territories. However, in Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, unlike in the rest of the country, five-pin is not the dominant form of bowling. In Quebec, five-pin is known as &quot;cinq quilles&quot; (five pins) in French, while &quot;Petites Quilles&quot; refers to the duckpin game. There is only one five-pin bowling alley in all of New Brunswick, whereas in Nova Scotia, the Worcester, Massachusetts–originated sport of candlepin bowling is more popular given that five-pin bowling alleys are located primarily on army bases. Nunavut has only one five-pin bowling alley. It is a two-lane facility located at CFS Alert and also happens to be the world&#x27;s most northerly bowling lanes. As a result, this alley is only accessible to military personnel and visitors to the base.
* Five-pin bowling was one of four sports featured on the &quot;Canadian Inventions: Sports&quot; series issued by Canada Post stamps on August 10, 2009.
* As of summer 2024 there are only 26 remaining active free fall five-pin bowling lanes.
* In 2007, five-pin bowling was ranked #4 during the CBC miniseries &quot;The Greatest Canadian Invention&quot;.
