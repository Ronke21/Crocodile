<text>The T-72 is a family of Soviet main battle tanks that entered production in 1973. The T-72 was a development based on the T-64 using thought and design of the previous Object 167M. About 25,000 T-72 tanks have been built, and refurbishment has enabled many to remain in service for decades. It has been widely exported and has seen service in 40 countries and in numerous conflicts. The Russian T-90 introduced in 1992 and the Chinese Type 99 are further developments of the T-72. Production and development of various modernized T-72 models continues today.

==Development==
===Development from the T-64===
The T-72 was a product of a rivalry between design teams. Morozov KB was led by Alexander Morozov in Kharkiv. Uralvagon KB was led by Leonid Kartsev in Nizhny Tagil.

To improve on the T-62, two designs based on the tank were tested in 1964: Nizhny Tagil&#x27;s Object 167 (T-62B) and Kharkiv&#x27;s Object 434.

Ob. 434 was a technically ambitious prototype. Under the direction of Morozov in Kharkiv, a new design emerged with the hull reduced to the minimum size possible. To do this, the crew was reduced to three soldiers, removing the loader by introducing an automated loading system.

Ob. 167 was designed based on an Object 140 rebuilt by Kartsev and Valeri Venediktov. Ob. 167 was more advanced than Kartsev&#x27;s Ob. 165 and Ob. 166, and was also Kartsev&#x27;s favored model. In October 1961, when asked to ready Ob. 166 for production, Kartsev disagreed and instead offered to prepare the Ob. 167. This suggestion was rejected, and the Ob. 166 and Ob. 165 were readied as the T-62 and T-62A respectively. Unlike the Kharkiv tank, it eschewed the state-of-the-art prototypes and used the turret from the T-62, and a manual loader. In 1964, the tank underwent comparative testing with the Ob. 434, in which the former proved its superiority to both the T-62 and T-55. Ob. 167 was favored by Uralvagonzavod director I.V. Okunev and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who believed the tank was more affordable. Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Dmitry Ustinov, believed the parallel development of Ob. 167 jeopardized the future of the Kharkiv tank. In December 1962, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union ordered Ob. 432 (later serialized as the T-64) into production, dooming Kartsev&#x27;s tank.

Kartsev continued to work on the Ob. 167. Ob. 167M incorporated an autoloader. This model too was rejected in May 1964.

Problems with the early production run were evident from the start, but a strong lobby formed around Morozov who advocated for Ob. 434 in Moscow, preventing rival developments and ideas from being discussed. Ob. 434 was accepted into Soviet Army service in May 1968 as the T-64A.

The T-64&#x27;s smaller design presented a problem when selecting a suitable engine. The chosen 700 hp 5TDF engine was unreliable, difficult to repair, and had a guaranteed lifespan similar to World War II designs.

===Object 172===
In 1967, the Uralvagonzavod formed &quot;Section 520&quot;, which was to prepare the serial production of the T-64 for 1970. Because of the time-consuming construction of the 5TDF engines, which took about twice as long as the contemporary V-45, the Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv could not provide a sufficient number of 5TDF engines for all Soviet tank factories. The Military-Industrial Commission (VPK) authorized work on two alternative engines for a wartime T-64, a so-called &quot;mobilization model&quot; that could be produced more quickly and at half the cost. Obj. 219 (which became the T-80, with a GTD-1000T gas-turbine) was designed in Leningrad. Ob. 439 with a diesel V-45 engine was designed by Uralvagon KB at Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil.

GABTU sent a T-64A prototype with a team to Uralvagonzavod. Kartsev was to lead this team.

Kartsev was unsatisfied with the innovations of the T-64, and began instead a more comprehensive project to redesign the tank. Kartsev melded what he believed were the best aspects of the T-64A, Object 167, and an upgunned T-62.

During development the tank was code-named &quot;Ural&quot; after the Ural mountain region. Uralvagonzavod produced the first prototype with a T-62 turret, D-81 125-mm gun and V-45 engine in January 1968. Ob. 439 differed so greatly from the T-64 that it was redesignated as &quot;Object 172&quot;.

Kartsev&#x27;s defiance angered GABTU, which initially reprimanded him for his insubordination. However, after the tank proved indeed to possess potential as a less costly alternative to the T-64, Kartsev was allowed to continue work on his design. Politically motivated opposition continued to beset the tank throughout its development. Vagonka tank plant manager I.F. Krutyakov sought to subordinate Uralvagonzavod under Josef Kotin. Kartsev skillfully beat back this play for power, embarrassing Krutyakov in the process. Kartsev retired in August 1969, and was succeeded by Venediktov.

The team soon found out that the more powerful V-45 engine put a lot of stress on the T-64 hull, so that after some time cracks started to materialize. A more stable solution was sought.

Finally, an idea from 1960 was used, when a modification of the T-62 had been discussed: In 1961, two prototypes of &quot;Object 167&quot; had been built by Uralvagonzavod to test a stronger hull and running gear combination for that tank. Under influence from Kharkiv, the idea had been turned down by Moscow. But this construction, with its big, rubbercoated roadwheels now formed the basis for the mobilisation model of the T-64.

Additional changes were made to the automatic loading system, which also was taken from an earlier project, originally intended for a T-62 upgrade. The 125 mm ammunition, consisting of a separate projectile and a propellant charge, was now stored horizontally on two levels, not vertically on one level as in the T-64. It was said to be more reliable than the T-64 autoloader. In 1964, two 125-mm guns of the D-81 type had been used to evaluate their installation in to the T-62, so the Ural plant was ready to adopt the 125 mm calibre for the T-64A as well.

Venediktov&#x27;s team later replaced the T-64-style suspension with the Obj. 167&#x27;s suspension. The tank was trialed in Kubinka in 1968, and Central Asia in 1969. After intensive comparative testing with the T-64A, Object 172 was re-engineered in 1970 to deal with some minor problems. Further trials took place in Transbaikal in 1971.

===T-72===
Being only a mobilisation model, serial production of Object 172 was not possible in peacetime. However, by 1971, even Ustinov was growing tired of problems with the T-64. In an unclear political process decree number 326-113 was issued, which allowed the production of Object 172 in the Soviet Union from 1 January 1972, and freed Uralvagonzavod from the T-64A production.

An initial production run began in 1972 at Nizhni Tagil. These were trialed in the Soviet Army. A final trial batch was built as &quot;Object 172M&quot; and tested in 1973 and accepted into service as the &quot;T-72&quot; in 1974.

Uralvagon KB continued to iterate on the T-72 in a series of block improvements.
Obj. 172M-1 introduced ceramic/steel laminate turret armour. The coincidence rangefinder was replaced with a laser rangefinder. Obj. 172M-1 was designated as the T-72A when it entered production in 1979. Turret armour was greatly improved with Obj. 184. A more powerful V-84 engine was introduced to offset the increased weight. Obj. 184 entered service in 1985 as the T-72B.

At least some technical documentation on the T-72 is known to have been passed to the CIA by the Polish Colonel Ryszard Kukliński between 1971 and 1982.

==Production history==

The first series production of T-72 Object 172M began in July at UKBM in Nizhny Tagil. However, due to difficulties in getting the factory organised for the change in production from T-64 to T-72, only 30 completed tanks were delivered in 1973. Troubles continued in 1974 where out of a state production quota of 440 only 220 were officially declared, with the actual number of completed tanks being close to 150. As a result, substantial investment in tooling was undertaken. Only after modernisation, could the factory begin full-scale production of the T-72. Nizhny Tagil produced the tank in various modifications until 1992.

The T-72 was the most common tank used by the Warsaw Pact from the 1970s until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It was also exported to other countries, such as Finland, India, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yugoslavia, as well as being copied elsewhere, both with and without licenses.
Licensed versions of the T-72 were made in Poland and Czechoslovakia, for Warsaw Pact consumers. The Polish-made T-72G tanks also had thinner armour compared to Soviet Army standard (410 mm for turret). Before 1990, Soviet-made T-72 export versions were similarly downgraded for non-Warsaw Pact customers (mostly the Arab countries). Many parts and tools are not interchangeable between the Soviet, Polish and Czechoslovakian versions, which caused logistics problems.

Yugoslavia developed the T-72 into the more advanced M-84, and sold hundreds of them around the world during the 1980s. The Iraqis called their T-72 copies the &quot;Lion of Babylon&quot; (&quot;Asad Babil&quot;). These Iraqi tanks were assembled from kits sold to them by the Soviet Union as a means of evading the UN-imposed weapons embargo. More modern derivatives include the Polish PT-91 &quot;Twardy&quot;. Several countries, including Russia and Ukraine, also offer modernization packages for older T-72s.

Various versions of the T-72 have been in production for decades, and the specifications for its armour have changed considerably. Original T-72 tanks had homogeneous cast steel armour incorporating spaced armour technology and were moderately well protected by the standards of the early 1970s. In 1979, the Soviets began building T-72 modification with composite armour similar to the T-64 composite armour, in the front of the turret and the front of the hull. Late in the 1980s, T-72 tanks in Soviet inventory (and many of those elsewhere in the world as well) were fitted with reactive armour tiles.

TPD-K1 laser rangefinder system have appeared in T-72 tanks since 1974; earlier examples were equipped with parallax optical rangefinders, which could not be used for distances under . Some export versions of the T-72 lacked the laser rangefinder until 1985 or sometimes only the squadron and platoon commander tanks (version K) received them. After 1985, all newly made T-72s came with reactive armour as standard, the more powerful V-84 engine and an upgraded design main gun, which can fire guided anti-tank missiles from the barrel. With these developments, the T-72 eventually became almost as powerful as the more expensive T-80 tank, but few of these late variants reached the economically ailing Warsaw Pact allies and foreign customers before the Soviet bloc fell apart in 1990. In the 1990s some reserve T-72B were given a minor upgrade of an uprated engine and better gun stabilisation to become the T-72BA. While not a popular upgrade, it solved a temporary supply shortage.

Since 2000, export vehicles have been offered with thermal imaging night-vision gear of French manufacture as well (though it may be more likely that they might simply use the locally manufactured &#x27;Buran-Catherine&#x27; system, which incorporates a French thermal imager). Depleted uranium armour-piercing ammunition for the gun has been manufactured in Russia in the form of the BM-32 projectile since around 1978, though it has never been deployed, and has less penetration than the later tungsten BM-42 and the newer BM-42M.

In 2010, Russia started an upgrade using the enormous stocks of T-72Bs held in reserve. The rebuild tank is called T-72B3 (Ob&#x27;yekt 184-M3).

In 2018, the 3rd Central Research Institute in Moscow had tested a proof-of-concept demonstration for robotic tank mobility, and was planning to further develop it based on the T-72B3 and other platforms.

In 2022, Ukrainian intelligence sources claimed that the upgrade of the Russian T-72 fleet has slowed during the invasion of Ukraine while production of the more modern T-90s and T-14 Armatas has slowed down because of the international sanctions affecting the Russian military industry. However, more tanks of T-72 and T-90 types were ordered in August 2022. A new batch of T-72B3M tanks was reportedly delivered in late 2022.

===Models===

Main models of the T-72, built in the Soviet Union and Russia. Command tanks have &quot;K&quot; added to their designation for &quot;komandirskiy&quot;, &quot;command&quot;, for example &quot;T-72K&quot; is the command version of the basic T-72. Versions with reactive armour have &quot;V&quot; added, for &quot;vzryvnoy&quot;, &quot;explosive&quot;.

==Design characteristics==

The T-72 shares many design features with other tank designs of Soviet origin. Some of these are viewed as deficiencies in a straight comparison to NATO tanks, but most are a product of the way these tanks were envisioned to be employed, based on the Soviets&#x27; practical experiences in World War II.

===Weight===
The T-72 is extremely lightweight, at forty-one tonnes, and very small compared to Western main battle tanks. Some of the roads and bridges in former Warsaw Pact countries were designed such that T-72s can travel along in formation, but NATO tanks could not pass at all, or just one-by-one, significantly reducing their mobility. The basic T-72 is relatively underpowered, with a supercharged version of the basic V12 diesel engine originally designed for the World War II-era T-34. The wide tracks run on large-diameter road wheels, which allows for easy identification of the T-72 and descendants (the T-64 family has relatively small road wheels).

The T-72 is designed to cross rivers up to deep submerged using a small diameter snorkel assembled onsite. The crew is individually supplied with simple rebreather chest-pack apparatuses for emergency situations. If the engine stops underwater, it must be restarted within six seconds, or the T-72&#x27;s engine compartment becomes flooded due to pressure loss. The snorkeling procedure is considered dangerous, but is important for maintaining operational mobility.

===Nuclear, biological, and chemical protection===

The T-72 has a nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection system. The inside of both hull and turret is lined with a synthetic fabric made of boron compound, meant to reduce the penetrating radiation from neutron bomb explosions. The crew is supplied clean air via an air filter system. A slight over-pressure prevents entry of contamination via bearings and joints. Use of an autoloader for the main gun allows for more efficient forced smoke removal compared to traditional manually loaded (&quot;pig-loader&quot;) tank guns, so NBC isolation of the fighting compartment can, in theory, be maintained indefinitely.

===Interior===

Like all Soviet-legacy tanks, the T-72&#x27;s design has traded off interior space in return for a very small silhouette and efficient use of armour, to the point of replacing the fourth crewman with a mechanical loader. There is a widespread Cold War-era myth that Soviet tanks were so cramped that height constraints were put in place, with a maximum height of 5 ft 4in (163 cm). However, official regulations state that the T-72 allowed for a height of 5 ft 9in (175 cm), which was standard for other tanks at the time. The basic T-72 design has extremely small periscope viewports, even by the constrained standards of battle tanks and the driver&#x27;s field of vision is significantly reduced when his hatch is closed. The steering system is a traditional dual-tiller layout instead of the easier-to-use steering wheel or steering yoke common in modern Western tanks. This set-up requires the near-constant use of both hands, which complicates employment of the seven speed manual transmission.

===Armour===

Armour protection of the T-72 was strengthened with each succeeding generation. The original T-72 &quot;Ural&quot; Object 172M&#x27;s (from 1973) turret is made from conventional cast high hardness steel (HHS) armour with no laminate inserts. It is believed that the maximum thickness is and the nose is . The glacis of the new laminated armour is thick, comprising HHS, double layer of laminate and RHA steel, which when inclined gives about thickness along the line of sight. In 1977 the armour of the T-72 Object 172M was slightly changed. The turret now featured insert filled with ceramic sand bars &quot;kwartz&quot; rods and the glacis plate composition was changed. It was now made up of HHA steel, glass Tekstolit laminate and RHA steel. This version was often known in Soviet circles as T-72 &quot;Ural-1&quot;. The next armour update was introduced by the T-72A (Object 172M-1), which was designed in 1976 and replaced the original on the production lines during 1979–1985. With the introduction of the T-72B (Object 184) in 1985, the composite armour was again changed. According to retired major, James M. Warford, variants developed after the T-72 base model and T-72M/T-72G MBT, featured a cast steel turret that included a cavity filled with quartz or sand in a form similar to US &quot;fused-silica&quot; armour. The T-72 Model 1978 (Obiekt 172M sb-4), which entered production in 1977, featured a new turret with special armour composed of ceramic rods.

The T-72A featured a new turret with thicker, nearly vertical, frontal armour. Due to its appearance, it was unofficially nicknamed &quot;Dolly Parton&quot; armour by the US Army. This used the new ceramic-rod turret filler, incorporated improved glacis laminate armour, and mounted new anti-shaped-charge sideskirts.

The T-72M was identical to the base T-72 Ural model in terms of protection, retaining the monolithic steel turret. The modernized T-72M1 was closer to the T-72A in terms of protection. It featured an additional of high hardness steel appliqué armour on the glacis plate, which produced an increase of in line of sight thickness. It was also the first export variant with composite armour in the turret, containing ceramic rods sometimes called &quot;sandbar armour&quot;. The turret armour composition was essentially identical to the T-72 &quot;Ural-1&quot; whereas Soviet-only T-72As had slightly increased turret protection.

Several T-72 models featured explosive reactive armour (ERA), which increased protection primarily against high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) type weapons. Certain late-model T-72 tanks featured Kontakt-5 ERA, a form of &quot;universal&quot; ERA partly effective against kinetic penetrators. It was added to the T-72 as a response to testing conducted by the Soviet Union against captured Israeli Magach-4 tanks which found that the glacis of the T-72 could be penetrated by the 105mm M111 APDSFS &quot;Hetz&quot; ammunition.

Late model T-72s, such as the T-72B, featured improved turret armour, visibly bulging the turret front—nicknamed &quot;super-Dolly Parton&quot; armour by Western intelligence. The turret armour of the T-72B was the thickest and most effective of all Soviet tank armour; it was even thicker than the frontal armour of the T-80B. The T-72B used a new &quot;reflecting-plate armour&quot; (&quot;bronya s otrazhayushchimi listami&quot;), in which the frontal cavity of the cast turret was filled with a laminate of alternating steel and non-metallic (rubber) layers. The glacis was also fitted with of appliqué armour. The late production versions of the T-72B/B1 and T-72A variants also featured an anti-radiation layer on the hull roof.

Early model T-72s did not feature side skirts; instead, the original base model featured gill or flipper-type armour panels on either side of the forward part of the hull. When the T-72A was introduced in 1979, it was the first model to feature the plastic side skirts covering the upper part of the suspension, with separate panels protecting the side of the fuel and stowage panniers.

After the collapse of the USSR, US and German analysts had a chance to examine Soviet-made T-72 tanks equipped with Kontakt-5 ERA, and they proved impenetrable to most Cold War US and German tank projectiles and anti-tank weapons. A U.S. Army spokesperson claimed at the show, &quot;the myth of Soviet inferiority in this sector of arms production that has been perpetuated by the failure of downgraded T-72 export tanks in the Gulf Wars has, finally, been laid to rest. The results of these tests show that if a NATO/Warsaw Pact confrontation had erupted in Europe, the Soviets would have had parity (or perhaps even superiority) in armour&quot;. KE-effective ERA, such as Kontakt-5, drove the development of M829A3 ammunition.

Late 1980s, Soviet developed Object 187 (Объект 187, or T-72BI), it was a parallel project to Object 188 (the T-90 tank). It was based on the T-72B, with a heavily modified turret. The &#x27;Object 187&#x27; used composite armour for the turret (&quot;Super Dolly Parton&quot; composite armour) and the hull front, and RHA for the rest of the tank. It possibly consisted of special materials including ceramic or high density uranium alloys. Maximum physical thickness of the passive armour (not counting the reactive armour – ERA) was up to 950 mm RHA. With Kontakt-5 ERA, T-72BI&#x27;s frontal armour was immune to the NATO&#x27;s 120 mm L/44 tank gun. However, after the Soviet collapse, the tank was not accepted.

In 2021, Russian Army T-72B3s were seen fitted with raised mesh screens above their turrets. The screens appeared to act as a type of slat armour attempting to protect the tanks from top attack weapons such as the FGM-148 Javelin ATGM and small air-to-ground munitions fired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

====Estimated protection level====
The following table shows the estimated protection level of different T-72 models in rolled homogeneous armour equivalency, i.e., the composite armour of the turret of a T-72B offers as much protection against an armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) round as a thick armour steel layer.

Kontakt 1 or 5 can be replaced with Relikt, a later ERA package that defends against tandem-charge warheads and reduces penetration of APFSDS rounds by over 50 percent. For a T-72B, adding Relikt improves APFSDS protection on the turret to 1,000–1,050 mm, and on the hull to 950–1,000 mm. Relikt is mounted as standard on the T-90MS, while Kontakt 5 is still standard on the T-90S.

===Gun===

The T-72 is equipped with the 2A46 series main gun, a significantly larger (20-mm larger) calibre than the standard gun found in contemporary Western MBTs, and still slightly larger than the 120 mm/L44 found in many modern Western MBTs. As is typical of Soviet tanks, the gun can fire anti-tank guided missiles, and standard main gun ammunition, including HEAT and APFSDS rounds.

The original T-72 Object 172M (1973) used the 2A26M2 model gun, which had been first mounted on the T-64. The barrel had a length of 6350 mm or 50.8 calibers and had a maximum rated chamber pressure of 450 MPa. The cannon had an electroplated chrome lining but lacked a thermal sleeve. The cannon was capable of firing 3VBM-3 rounds with 3BM-9 steel projectile sabot and 3VBM-6 rounds with 3BM-12 Tungsten sabot APFSDS projectile, allowing respectively and penetration of RHA steel at 2000m at a 0-degree angle. In addition to APFSDS rounds, T-72 Object 172M could also fire 3VBK-7 rounds incorporating 3BK-12 HEAT warheads and 3VBK-10 rounds incorporating 3BK-14 HEAT warheads. HEAT rounds allowed respectively and penetration of RHA steel at a 0-degree angle. The High Explosive rounds provided included 3WOF-22 rounds with 3OF-19 warheads or 3WOF-36 rounds with 3OF-26 warheads. For all types of rounds, Zh40 propellant was used. Complementing the original gun setup was a 2E28M &quot;Siren&quot; two-plane electrohydraulic stabilizer allowing automatic stabilization with speeds from 0.05 to 6 degrees per second.

Even as the T-72 Object 172M (1973) was entering production new ammunition was developed to offset armour developments in the West. Beginning in 1972, two new APFSDS rounds were introduced, the 3VBM-7 round with 3BM-15 Tungsten sabot projectile and the &quot;cheaper&quot; 3VBM-8 round with 3BM-17 sabot but without the tungsten carbide plug. These allowed penetration of respectively and RHA steel at 2000 m at 0-degree angle. At the same time, a universal Zh52 propellant charge was introduced. The 3VBM-7 was the most common APFSDS round found in T-72 Object 172M tanks during the 1970s.

The stated barrel life expectancy of the 2A26M2 model gun was 600 rounds of HE/HEAT equivalent to 600 EFC (Effective Full Charge) or 150 rounds of APFSDS.
The main gun of the T-72 has a mean error of at a range of . Its maximum firing distance is , due to limited positive elevation. The limit of aimed fire is with the gun-launched anti-tank guided missile. The T-72&#x27;s main gun is fitted with an integral pressure reserve drum, which assists in rapid smoke evacuation from the bore after firing. The 125 millimeter gun barrel is certified strong enough to ram the tank through forty centimeters of iron-reinforced brick wall, though doing so will negatively affect the gun&#x27;s accuracy when subsequently fired.

The vast majority of T-72s do not have advanced FLIR thermal imaging sights, which allow night vision at longer ranges and with no infrared lamps. Most of the T-72s possess the characteristic &#x27;Luna&#x27; Infrared illuminator. Export upgrades allow for installation of advanced night sights.

===Autoloader===

Like the earlier domestic-use-only T-64, the T-72 is equipped with an automatic loading system, eliminating the need for a dedicated crewmember, decreasing the size and weight of the tank.

However, the autoloader is of a noticeably different design. Both the T-64 and T-72 carry their two-section 125 mm ammunition (shell and full propellant charge, or missile and reduced propellant charge) in separate loading trays positioned on top of each other; but firstly, in T-64, 28 of these were arranged vertically as a ring under the turret ring proper, and were rotated to put the correct tray into position under the hoist system in the turret rear. This had the disadvantage of cutting the turret off from the rest of the tank, most notably, the driver. Accessing the hull required partial removal of the trays. The T-72 uses a design that has lower width requirements and does not isolate the turret compartment: the trays are arranged in a circle at the very bottom of the fighting compartment; the trade-off is the reduction of the number of trays to 22. The second difference is that in the T-64 the trays were hinged together and were flipped open as they were brought into position, allowing both the shell/missile and propellant charge to be rammed into the breech in one motion; in the T-72 the tray is brought to the breech as-is, with the shell in the lower slot and the charge in the upper one, and the mechanical rammer sequentially loads each of them, resulting in a longer reloading cycle.

The autoloader has a minimum cycle of 6.5 seconds (ATGM 8 seconds) and a maximum cycle of 15 seconds for reload, in later versions the sequence mode allows to reload in less than 5 seconds, allowing to reach 3 shots in 13 seconds.

The autoloader system also includes an automated casing removal mechanism that ejects the propellant case through an opening port in the back of the turret during the following reload cycle.

The autoloader disconnects the gun from the vertical stabilizer and cranks it up three degrees above the horizontal in order to depress the breech end of the gun and line it up with the loading tray and rammer. While loading, the gunner can still aim because he has a vertically independent sight. With a laser rangefinder and ballistic computer, final aiming takes at least another three to five seconds, but it is pipelined into the last steps of auto-loading and proceeds concurrently.

In addition to the 22 autoloaded rounds, the T-72 carries 17 rounds conventionally in the hull, which can be loaded into the emptied autoloader trays or directly into the gun.

The T-72B3 modernization replaced the old autoloader with a new one to fit longer projectiles such as 3BM59 and 3BM60. Previous variants are limited and may only carry older APFSDS rounds that can not exceed a certain length, therefore allowing less performance from anti-tank rounds.

The way that the unused rounds are stored in the autoloader system has been exposed as a flaw, as observers have noted that penetrating hits can easily set off a chain reaction that detonates all of the ammunition. The result is the turret is blown off resulting in a so-called &quot;jack-in-the-box&quot; explosion. This vulnerability was first observed during the Gulf War. However, contrary to popular belief, the flaw is mostly related to the spare ammunition in the turret, outside of the autoloader. The autoloaders have some ballistic protection, but only hold roughly half of a T-72’s ammunition. During the Chechen war in 1994, the Russians were able to reduce their losses by having their tanks carry fewer rounds so that all the ammunition and propellant was stored in the autoloaders.

==Operators and service==

The T-72 was never used in the Afghanistan War. The 40th Soviet Army that was deployed there had mainly T-55, and T-62 tanks.

The Russian Federation had over 10,000 T-72 tanks in use, including around 2,000 in active service and 8,000 in reserve (mostly T-72Bs). The T-72 has been used by the Russian Army in the fighting during the First and Second Chechen Wars, the Russo-Georgian War, and the Russo-Ukrainian War. The T-72 has been used by over 40 countries worldwide.

===Syria===
In the 1982 Lebanon War, Syrian T-72s are believed to have engaged Israeli tanks (M60A1, Magach or possibly Merkava tanks) in the south of Lebanon. On 9 June 1982, the Syrian General HQ ordered a brigade of the 1st Armoured Division, recently equipped with T-72 tanks, to move straight ahead, cross the border, and hit the right flank of the Israeli units advancing along the eastern side of Beka&#x27;a valley. The ensuing battle staved off further Israeli advance and 10 IDF main battle tanks were destroyed. After the war, Syrian president Hafez al-Assad called it &quot;the best tank in the world&quot;.

The T-72 has been in extensive use in the Syrian Civil War by the Syrian Arab Army since 2011. Several captured units have been used by anti-government forces, including the rebel Free Syrian Army, and jihadist groups such as the Islamic Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

Initially, the insurgent forces used IEDs and RPG-7 ambush tactics against the government armoured forces. Later, the rebels obtained modern Russian RPGs and Yugoslav M79 Osas, which were used successfully against T-72s. Starting in 2012, the capture from Syrian stocks and later direct delivery by external sponsors of modern anti-tank guided missiles, including Chinese-made HJ-8, Soviet-made 9K111 Fagot, 9M113 Konkurs, and 9K115 Metis, and U.S.-made BGM-71 TOW missile enabled the opposition forces to engage and destroy any government armoured vehicle types, T-72 included, from safer distances. As of March 2020, at least 837 T-72 tanks operated by the Syrian armed forces were destroyed according to visual recordings.

===Iraq===

Iraqi T-72 Ural (1973)s, T-72 Ural Modernization, T-72Ms and T-72M1s were used successfully throughout the Iran-Iraq War and in countless operations, among others Operation Nasr, in the battle for Basra and during the Tawakalna ala Allah Operations. 105 mm M68 tank guns and TOW missiles proved ineffective against the frontal armour of Iraqi T-72s. Sixty T-72 tanks were lost during the eight years of war. Ra&#x27;ad Al-Hamdani, an Iraqi general in the Iraqi Republican Guard, stating &quot;The 16th Iranian Armoured Division, which was equipped with Chieftain tanks, lost a battle against the 10th Iraqi Armoured Brigade with T-72 tanks. It is hard for an armoured brigade to destroy a division in 12 hours but it happened; it was a disaster for the Iranians&quot;. Out of the 894 Chieftain tanks that had started the war only 200 were left by the war&#x27;s end. The 3BM9 APFSDS shell was more than enough to deal with any NATO tank of the time, including the most heavily armoured such as the M60A1 and the Chieftain. According to a Soviet analysis of an Iranian Chieftain captured by the Iraqi army during the early part of the Iran-Iraq war, the Chieftain Mk.5 was considered to have totally insufficient protection even at its strongest points. The frontal part of the entire turret, hull upper front plate and lower front plate could all be defeated at 3 km or more. This essentially means that the T-72 Ural could defeat one of NATO&#x27;s toughest tanks at any reasonable combat distance. According to Iranians and Iraqis, the T-72 was the most feared tank of the Iran–Iraq War.

During the invasion of Kuwait Iraq used 690 tanks, mainly T-55s, T-62s and T-72s. Kuwait had 281 tanks, including 6 T-72s, 165 Chieftains, 70 Vickers and 40 Centurions. On the morning of 2 August, near the Mutla Pass, a tank battle took place between the Vickers tanks of the 6th Kuwaiti Mechanized Brigade and the T-72s of the Republican Guard&#x27;s 17th Armoured Brigade, 1st Hammurabi Armoured Division. Kuwaiti tanks were able to knock out one T-72 during the ambush, but were defeated in response with the commander of the 6th brigade captured. Only 20 surviving Vickers tanks were able to retreat to Saudi Arabia.

The Iraqi-assembled T-72 version Lion of Babylon engaged coalition forces in both Iraq wars. The Battle of 73 Easting took place during a sandstorm in the Iraqi desert. U.S. M1A1s and Bradley Fighting Vehicles came up against Iraqi Republican Guard T-72Ms and BMPs and inflicted 37 losses on the Iraqi armoured forces, while losing a single Bradley to enemy fire. The primary attack was conducted by 2ACR&#x27;s three squadrons of about 400 soldiers, along with the 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s two leading brigades, who attacked and destroyed the Iraqi 18th Mechanized Brigade and 37th Armoured Brigade of the Tawakalna Division, each consisting of between 2,500 and 3,000 personnel. The Iraqi T-72Ms used 3BM9 shells (removed from Soviet service in 1973), with a penetration of 245 mm at a distance of up to . M60A1s of the 1st Marine Division Task Force Ripper led the drive to the Kuwait International Airport on 27 February 1991. Task Force Ripper&#x27;s M60A1 tanks destroyed about 100 Iraqi tanks and armoured personnel carriers, including T-72 tanks. The total number of T-72s lost during Operation Desert Storm was approximately 150.

As of 1996, Iraq had 776 T-72 tanks in service from 1,038 originally received.

===Chechen wars===
During the First Chechen War (December 1994 to September 1996) fought between the Russian Federation and the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, led by Dzhokhar Dudayev, the Russian Federation deployed both T-72 and T-80 tanks. Russian AFV losses during the first three months fighting amounted to 62 tank (T-72/T-80) losses (44 T-72s of 141, 18 T-80s of 71 and 0 PT-76s of 9). Analysis of damage to non repairable vehicles showed that no T-72 were lost to frontal penetration of the hull from man portable anti tank weapons.

Analysis of the causes of these losses indicated the majority were caused by Chechen four-man anti-armour hunter-killer teams consisting of a gunner armed with a Russian RPG-7 or RPG-18 shoulder-fired antitank rocket launcher, and a machine gunner and a sniper, with five or six such teams simultaneously attacking a single armoured vehicle. The majority of losses recorded occurred from three to six kill shot hits to the sides, top and rear of a vehicle.

Highlighted were serious tactical deployment failures, once again demonstrating doctrine and tactics being a primary factor in determining a tank&#x27;s worth. Following the serious losses to the Russian Federation during their first assault upon Grozny, armoured tactics were revised. Russian armoured vehicle losses dropped off with their change in tactics to have Russian infantry move in front, with armoured combat vehicles in support of the infantry. In particular use of AAA armoured vehicles, these vehicles can elevate their main armament to higher angles than the T-72 .

The Russian army captured seven of Dudayev&#x27;s T-72s and used them in combat. During the First Chechen War, at least two tank duels took place. In the first, Dudayev&#x27;s T-72A knocked out one T-62M belonging to pro-Russian Chechens. In the second, one of Dudayev&#x27;s T-72As was destroyed by a Russian T-72B. Three Russian T-72s are recorded as destroyed, at the hands of Chechen separatists, including one tank during the Second Chechen War, during the period 1997 to 2003.

===Russo-Georgian War===

During the war in South Ossetia in 2008 both sides deployed great numbers of T-72 tanks. At the time of the conflict, the Georgian military fielded 191 T-72 tanks of which 120 were modified to T-72SIM1s. The Georgian army deployed a total of 75 of its T-72 tanks into South Ossetia. The Georgian military lost 30 T-72s, ten in combat during the fighting around Tskhinvali, and another 20 destroyed by Russian paratroopers after their capture.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===

==== War in Donbas ====
On 26 August 2014, the International Institute for Strategic Studies claimed that it had identified a mixed Russian column composed of at least 3 T-72Bs and a lone T-72B3 in the war in Donbas. The significance of this sighting was that Russia attempted to maintain plausible deniability over the issue of supplying tanks and other arms to the separatists. Russia continuously claimed that any tanks operated by the separatists must have been captured from Ukraine&#x27;s own army. The T-72B3 is in service with the Russian Army in large numbers. This modernized T-72 is not known to have been exported to nor operated by any other country.

In an interview with Dorzhi Batomunkuev in March 2015, it was revealed that he had operated a T-72B as part of a 32 tank Russian army unit when fighting for Debaltseve in Ukraine in February 2015. His tank was destroyed and he suffered severe burns.

Before the conflict Ukraine had 600 T-72s in storage. However, encountering a deficiency of serviceable armoured vehicles, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence began returning some of the T-72s to service.

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
The T-72 has seen extensive service in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine on both sides.

Russia&#x27;s most numerous tank is the T-72B3 (mod. 2011 and 2016) and the older T-72B (mod. 1985 and 1989). In the buildup to the invasion, Russian forces applied improvised steel grilles to the top of the turret, known as &quot;cope cages&quot; by some commentators. Military analysts have speculated that such grilles were added in an attempt to counter the usage of top-attack weapons, such as the US made FGM-148 Javelin and British-Swedish NLAW, by Ukrainian forces. These implementations add weight to the tank, increase its visual profile, and make it more difficult for the crew to escape from the tank. Analysts have also speculated that they may be potentially used as a countermeasure against RPG-7s fired from above during urban combat, loitering munitions, or against drone attacks, as a response to lessons learned from the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. The lack of uniformity between the makeshift cage variants made from different meshes and iron fences suggest that they are largely improvised by the tank crews, and are not standard issue. In May 2022, some Russian tankers said they eventually removed the cages, as they obstructed the use of machine guns and radios, and prevented evacuation if the tank caught fire. As of 6 February 2025, Russia has lost a total of 1,653 T-72s of all variants according to Oryx.

Before the invasion, Ukraine owned T-72s left from the Soviet Union but were partly modernized. These mainly included T-72As and T-72AVs, as well as modernized T-72AMTs (mod. 2017). On 3 April, an image of a rare T-72 &quot;Ural&quot; (1973) equipped with Kontakt-1 ERA having been damaged appeared. As of April 2022, an unspecified number of Czech T-72M1s had been provided to Ukraine. Poland also donated over 200 T-72M1/M1R tanks to Ukraine. The Ukrainian Army had lost a total of 247 T-72 tanks as of June 19, 2024, according to Oryx.

* - Broken hulls, burnt-out engines, failed combat modules - in this issue of “Military Acceptance” we will talk about repair factories where military equipment that arrived from the front line is restored. Tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, armored personnel carriers - during the Northern Military District, all this requires not only repair, but also modernization. Dozens of enterprises scattered throughout the country do this: in the Far East, in the Urals, in Siberia, in Central Russia, in the south of the country, but these factories are not written about in newspapers, they are not talked about on television, few people know about them at all. Meanwhile, they make a significant contribution to the country’s defense capability. The host of the program, Alexey Egorov, became the first Russian journalist who, during the SVO period, went on a “tour” to repair plants to find out how the restoration of “wounded” cars was going.</text><links>

<text>A sinkhole is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer. The term is sometimes used to refer to doline, enclosed depressions that are also known as shakeholes, and to openings where surface water enters into underground passages known as &quot;ponor&quot;, swallow hole or swallet. A &quot;cenote&quot; is a type of sinkhole that exposes groundwater underneath. &quot;Sink&quot;, and &quot;stream sink&quot; are more general terms for sites that drain surface water, possibly by infiltration into sediment or crumbled rock.

Most sinkholes are caused by karst processes – the chemical dissolution of carbonate rocks, collapse or suffosion processes. Sinkholes are usually circular and vary in size from tens to hundreds of meters both in diameter and depth, and vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. Sinkholes may form gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide.

== Formation ==

=== Natural processes ===
Sinkholes may capture surface drainage from running or standing water, but may also form in high and dry places in specific locations. Sinkholes that capture drainage can hold it in large limestone caves. These caves may drain into tributaries of larger rivers.

The formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock (such as limestone) by percolating water, the collapse of a cave roof, or a lowering of the water table. Sinkholes often form through the process of suffosion. For example, groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles, gradually forming a void.

Occasionally a sinkhole may exhibit a visible opening into a cave below. In the case of exceptionally large sinkholes, such as the Minyé sinkhole in Papua New Guinea or Cedar Sink at Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky, an underground stream or river may be visible across its bottom flowing from one side to the other.

Sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone or other carbonate rock, salt beds, or in other soluble rocks, such as gypsum, that can be dissolved naturally by circulating ground water. Sinkholes also occur in sandstone and quartzite terrains.

As the rock dissolves, spaces and caverns develop underground. These sinkholes can be dramatic, because the surface land usually stays intact until there is not enough support. Then, a sudden collapse of the land surface can occur.

=== Space and planetary bodies ===
On 2 July 2015, scientists reported that active pits, related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts, were found on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the &quot;Rosetta&quot; space probe.

=== Artificial processes ===

Collapses, commonly incorrectly labeled as sinkholes, also occur due to human activity, such as the collapse of abandoned mines and salt cavern storage in salt domes in places like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, in the United States. More commonly, collapses occur in urban areas due to water main breaks or sewer collapses when old pipes give way. They can also occur from the overpumping and extraction of groundwater and subsurface fluids.

Sinkholes can also form when natural water drainage patterns are changed and new water diversion systems are developed. Some sinkholes form when the land surface is changed, such as when industrial and runoff storage ponds are created; the substantial weight of the new material can trigger a collapse of the roof of an existing void or cavity in the subsurface, resulting in development of a sinkhole.

==Classification==
===Solution sinkholes===
Solution or dissolution sinkholes form where water dissolves limestone under a soil covering. Dissolution enlarges natural openings in the rock such as joints, fractures, and bedding planes. Soil settles down into the enlarged openings forming a small depression at the ground surface.
===Cover-subsidence sinkholes===
Cover-subsidence sinkholes form where voids in the underlying limestone allow more settling of the soil to create larger surface depressions.
===Cover-collapse sinkholes===
Cover-collapse sinkholes or &quot;dropouts&quot; form where so much soil settles down into voids in the limestone that the ground surface collapses. The surface collapses may occur abruptly and cause catastrophic damages. New sinkhole collapses can also form when human activity changes the natural water-drainage patterns in karst areas.
===Pseudokarst sinkholes===
Pseudokarst sinkholes resemble karst sinkholes but are formed by processes other than the natural dissolution of rock.

==Human accelerated sinkholes==
The U.S. Geological Survey notes that &quot;It is a frightening thought to imagine the ground below your feet or house suddenly collapsing and forming a big hole in the ground.&quot; Human activities can accelerate collapses of karst sinkholes, causing collapse within a few years that would normally evolve over thousands of years under natural conditions. Soil-collapse sinkholes, which are characterized by the collapse of cavities in soil that have developed where soil falls down into underlying rock cavities, pose the most serious hazards to life and property. Fluctuation of the water level accelerates this collapse process. When water rises up through fissures in the rock, it reduces soil cohesion. Later, as the water level moves downward, the softened soil seeps downwards into rock cavities. Flowing water in karst conduits carries the soil away, preventing soil from accumulating in rock cavities and allowing the collapse process to continue.

Induced sinkholes occur where human activity alters how surface water recharges groundwater. Many human-induced sinkholes occur where natural diffused recharge is disturbed and surface water becomes concentrated. Activities that can accelerate sinkhole collapses include timber removal, ditching, laying pipelines, sewers, water lines, storm drains, and drilling. These activities can increase the downward movement of water beyond the natural rate of groundwater recharge. The increased runoff from the impervious surfaces of roads, roofs, and parking lots also accelerate man-induced sinkhole collapses.

Some induced sinkholes are preceded by warning signs, such as cracks, sagging, jammed doors, or cracking noises, but others develop with little or no warning. However, karst development is well understood, and proper site characterization can avoid karst disasters. Thus most sinkhole disasters are predictable and preventable rather than &quot;acts of God&quot;. The American Society of Civil Engineers has declared that the potential for sinkhole collapse must be a part of land-use planning in karst areas. Where sinkhole collapse of structures could cause loss of life, the public should be made aware of the risks.

The most likely locations for sinkhole collapse are areas where there is already a high density of existing sinkholes. Their presence shows that the subsurface contains a cave system or other unstable voids. Where large cavities exist in the limestone large surface collapses can occur, such the Winter Park, Florida sinkhole collapse. Recommendations for land uses in karst areas should avoid or minimize alterations of the land surface and natural drainage.

Since water level changes accelerate sinkhole collapse, measures must be taken to minimize water level changes. The areas most susceptible to sinkhole collapse can be identified and avoided. In karst areas the traditional foundation evaluations (bearing capacity and settlement) of the ability of soil to support a structure must be supplemented by geotechnical site investigation for cavities and defects in the underlying rock. Since the soil/rock surface in karst areas are very irregular the number of subsurface samples (borings and core samples) required per unit area is usually much greater than in non-karst areas.

In 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated the cost for repairs of damage arising from karst-related processes as at least $300 million per year over the preceding 15 years, but noted that this may be a gross underestimate based on inadequate data. The greatest amount of karst sinkhole damage in the United States occurs in Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania. The largest recent sinkhole in the USA is possibly one that formed in 1972 in Montevallo, Alabama, as a result of man-made lowering of the water level in a nearby rock quarry. This &quot;December Giant&quot; or &quot;Golly Hole&quot; sinkhole measures long, wide and deep.

Other areas of significant karst hazards include the Ebro Basin in northern Spain; the island of Sardinia; the Italian peninsula; the Chalk areas in southern England; Sichuan, China; Jamaica; France;Croatia; Bosnia and Herzegovina; Slovenia; and Russia, where one-third of the total land area is underlain by karst.

== Occurrence ==

Sinkholes tend to occur in karst landscapes. Karst landscapes can have up to thousands of sinkholes within a small area, giving the landscape a pock-marked appearance. These sinkholes drain all the water, so there are only subterranean rivers in these areas. Examples of karst landscapes with numerous massive sinkholes include Khammouan Mountains (Laos) and Mamo Plateau (Papua New Guinea). The largest known sinkholes formed in sandstone are Sima Humboldt and Sima Martel in Venezuela.

Some sinkholes form in thick layers of homogeneous limestone. Their formation is facilitated by high groundwater flow, often caused by high rainfall; such rainfall causes formation of the giant sinkholes in the Nakanaï Mountains, on the New Britain island in Papua New Guinea. Powerful underground rivers may form on the contact between limestone and underlying insoluble rock, creating large underground voids.

In such conditions, the largest known sinkholes of the world have formed, like the Xiaozhai Tiankeng (Chongqing, China), giant sótanos in Querétaro and San Luis Potosí states in Mexico and others.

Unusual processes have formed the enormous sinkholes of Sistema Zacatón in Tamaulipas (Mexico), where more than 20 sinkholes and other karst formations have been shaped by volcanically heated, acidic groundwater. This has produced not only the formation of the deepest water-filled sinkhole in the world—Zacatón—but also unique processes of travertine sedimentation in upper parts of sinkholes, leading to sealing of these sinkholes with travertine lids.

The U.S. state of Florida in North America is known for having frequent sinkhole collapses, especially in the central part of the state. Underlying limestone there is from 15 to 25 million years old. On the fringes of the state, sinkholes are rare or non-existent; limestone there is around 120,000 years old.

The Murge area in southern Italy also has numerous sinkholes. Sinkholes can be formed in retention ponds from large amounts of rain.

On the Arctic seafloor, methane emissions have caused large sinkholes to form.

== Human uses ==
Sinkholes have been used for centuries as disposal sites for various forms of waste. A consequence of this is the pollution of groundwater resources, with serious health implications in such areas.

The Maya civilization sometimes used sinkholes in the Yucatán Peninsula (known as cenotes) as places to deposit precious items and human sacrifices.

When sinkholes are very deep or connected to caves, they may offer challenges for experienced cavers or, when water-filled, divers. Some of the most spectacular are the Zacatón cenote in Mexico (the world&#x27;s deepest water-filled sinkhole), the Boesmansgat sinkhole in South Africa, Sarisariñama tepuy in Venezuela, the Sótano del Barro in Mexico, and in the town of Mount Gambier, South Australia. Sinkholes that form in coral reefs and islands that collapse to enormous depths are known as blue holes and often become popular diving spots.
== Local names ==

Large and visually unusual sinkholes have been well known to local people since ancient times. Nowadays sinkholes are grouped and named in site-specific or generic names. Some examples of such names are listed below.

* Aven – In the south of France (this name means pit cave in the Occitan language).
* Black holes (not to be confused with cosmic black holes) – This term refers to a group of unique, round, water-filled pits in the Bahamas. These formations seem to be dissolved in carbonate mud from above, by the sea water. The dark color of the water is caused by a layer of phototropic microorganisms concentrated in a dense, purple colored layer at depth; this layer &quot;swallows&quot; the light. Metabolism in the layer of microorganisms causes heating of the water. One of them is the Black Hole of Andros.
* Blue holes – This name was initially given to the deep underwater sinkholes of the Bahamas but is often used for any deep water-filled pits formed in carbonate rocks. The name originates from the deep blue color of water in these sinkholes, which is created by the high clarity of the water and the great depth of the sinkholes; only the deep blue color of the visible spectrum can penetrate such depth and return after reflection.
* Cenote – This refers to the characteristic water-filled sinkholes in the Yucatán Peninsula, Belize and some other regions. Many cenotes have formed in limestone deposited in shallow seas created by the Chicxulub meteorite&#x27;s impact.
* Dolina – Slovenian toponym internationally used for karst sinkholes. The original meaning is &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;.
* Foiba – Friulan Italian dialect word (from the Latin fŏvea: &quot;pit&quot; or &quot;chasm&quot;). The name is given to sinkholes in the frontier zone between the Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Croatia and Slovenia, in the Karst Plateau.
* Sótanos – This name is given to several giant pits in several states of Mexico.
* Tiankengs – These are extremely large sinkholes, typically deeper and wider than , with mostly vertical walls, most often created by the collapse of caverns. The term means &quot;sky holes&quot; in Chinese; many of this largest type of sinkhole are located in China.
* Tomo – This term is used in New Zealand karst country to describe sinkholes.
* Vrtača, ponikva, dolac, dô – South Slavic terms for sinkhole.

== Piping pseudokarst==
The 2010 Guatemala City sinkhole formed suddenly in May of that year; torrential rains from Tropical Storm Agatha and a bad drainage system were blamed for its creation. It swallowed a three-story building and a house; it measured approximately wide and deep. A similar hole had formed nearby in February 2007.

This large vertical hole is not a true sinkhole, as it did not form via the dissolution of limestone, dolomite, marble, or any other water-soluble rock. Instead, they are examples of &quot;piping pseudokarst&quot;, created by the collapse of large cavities that had developed in the weak, crumbly Quaternary volcanic deposits underlying the city. Although weak and crumbly, these volcanic deposits have enough cohesion to allow them to stand in vertical faces and to develop large subterranean voids within them. A process called &quot;soil piping&quot; first created large underground voids, as water from leaking water mains flowed through these volcanic deposits and mechanically washed fine volcanic materials out of them, then progressively eroded and removed coarser materials. Eventually, these underground voids became large enough that their roofs collapsed to create large holes.

== Crown hole==

A crown hole is subsidence due to subterranean human activity, such as mining and military trenches. Examples have included, instances above World War I trenches in Ypres, Belgium; near mines in Nitra, Slovakia; a limestone quarry in Dudley, England; and above an old gypsum mine in Magheracloone, Ireland.

<doc id="186194" wikidata="Q16848181" url="?curid=186194" title="International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design">
<text>The International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design (ISCID) was a creationism advocacy organization that described itself as &quot;a cross-disciplinary professional society that investigates complex systems apart from external programmatic constraints like materialism, naturalism, or reductionism.&quot; It was founded and led by figures associated with the intelligent design movement, such as William A. Dembski and Michael Behe.

== Overview ==

The society was launched on 6 December 2001. It was co-founded by William A. Dembski, Micah Sparacio and John Bracht. Dembski served as its executive director. It had about sixty fellows, many of them figures associated with the intelligent design movement and fellows of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture, including Dembski, Behe, Jonathan Wells, William Lane Craig, and Henry F. Schaefer. Other notable ISCID fellows include philosopher of religion Alvin Plantinga and physics professor and theologian Frank J. Tipler.

ISCID hosted its first online symposium in October 2002, titled &quot;The Teleological Origin of Biological Information.&quot;

ISCID described itself as providing &quot;a forum for formulating, testing, and disseminating research on complex systems through critique, peer review, and publication,&quot; with an aim &quot;to pursue the theoretical development, empirical application, and philosophical implications of information- and design-theoretic concepts for complex systems.&quot;

ISCID maintained an online journal titled &quot;Progress in Complexity, Information and Design&quot; (&quot;PCID&quot;). Articles were submitted through its website and could appear in the journal if they had been approved by one of the fellows. Dembski and Tipler believed that this review process was preferable to the process of scholarly peer review commonly used in mainstream journals, citing that peer review &quot;too often degenerates into a vehicle for censoring novel ideas that break with existing frameworks.&quot;

ISCID also hosted an online forum called Brainstorms and maintains a copyrighted online user-written Internet encyclopedia called the &quot;ISCID Encyclopedia of Science and Philosophy&quot;. The society featured online chats with intelligent-design proponents and others sympathetic to the movement or interested in aspects of complex systems. Past chats included people such as Ray Kurzweil, David Chalmers, Stuart Kauffman, Christopher Michael Langan and Robert Wright.

In May 2011 the society&#x27;s website stated that &quot;ISCID is no longer being managed as an organization&quot;. The last issue of &quot;PCID&quot; was published in November 2005, its essay contests had been discontinued, and the last moderated chat was in 2004. By 2014, its website was no longer online.

== &quot;PCID&quot; peer review controversy ==
ISCID&#x27;s journal, &quot;Progress in Complexity, Information, and Design&quot; has been cited as an example of a journal set up by intelligent design proponents to publish articles promoting intelligent design without a peer review process with sufficient impartiality and rigor. ISCID fellows who comprised &quot;PCID&quot;&#x27;s reviewers were characterized as &quot;ardent supporters of intelligent design.&quot;

ISCID&#x27;s peer review policy for &quot;PCID&quot; was based on ISCID Fellow Frank Tipler&#x27;s article covering what he saw as problems with traditional peer review processes. ISCID required that for articles to be accepted into the archive, they &quot;need to meet basic scholarly standards and be relevant to the study of complex systems.&quot; Once in the archive, articles only needed to be approved by a single ISCID Fellow in order to be published. ISCID says that this policy is designed to provide peer review for quality without squelching paradigm changing theories. However, the American Association for the Advancement of Science contended that review processes such as &quot;PCID&quot;&#x27;s were different from the accepted standard of peer review, where &quot;reviewers are experts in the relevant scientific fields who have no conflict of interest with or especially close personal relationships to the authors or requestors.&quot;

==Fellows==
In addition to guiding the society&#x27;s various programs, fellows served as the editorial advisory board that peer-reviewed the society&#x27;s journal, &quot;PCID&quot;.

<doc id="186204" wikidata="Q172233" url="?curid=186204" title="T-34">
<text>The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank from World War II. When introduced, its 76.2 mm (3 in) tank gun was more powerful than many of its contemporaries, and its 60-degree sloped armour provided good protection against anti-tank weapons. The T-34 had a profound effect on the conflict on the Eastern Front, and had a long-lasting impact on tank design. The tank was praised by multiple German generals when encountered during Operation Barbarossa, although its armour and armament were surpassed later in the war. Its main strength was its cost and production time, meaning that German panzer forces would often fight against Soviet tank forces several times their own size. The T-34 was also a critical part of the mechanized divisions that formed the backbone of the deep battle strategy.

The T-34 was the mainstay of the Soviet Red Army armoured forces throughout the war. Its general specifications remained nearly unchanged until early 1944, when it received a firepower upgrade with the introduction of the greatly improved T-34-85 variant. Its production method was continuously refined and rationalized to meet the needs of the Eastern Front, making the T-34 quicker and cheaper to produce. The Soviets ultimately built over 80,000 T-34s of all variants, allowing steadily greater numbers to be fielded despite the loss of tens of thousands in combat against the German Wehrmacht. 

Replacing many light and medium tanks in Red Army service, it was the most-produced tank of the war, as well as the second most-produced tank of all time (after its successor, the T-54/T-55 series). With 44,900 lost or damaged during the war, it also suffered the most tank losses ever. Its development led directly to the T-44, then the T-54 and T-55 series of tanks, which in turn evolved into the later T-62, that form the armoured core of many modern armies. T-34 variants were widely exported after World War II, and as recently as 2023 more than 80 T-34s were still in service.

==Development and production==
===Origins===
In 1939, the most numerous Soviet tank models were the T-26 infantry tank and the BT series of fast tanks. The T-26 was slow-moving, designed to keep pace with infantry on the ground. The BT tanks were cavalry tanks: fast-moving and light, designed for manoeuver warfare. Both were Soviet developments of foreign designs from the early 1930s: the T-26 was based on the British Vickers 6-Ton, and the BT tanks were based on a design from American engineer J. Walter Christie.

In 1937, the Red Army had assigned engineer Mikhail Koshkin to lead a new team to design a replacement for the BT tanks at the Kharkiv Komintern Locomotive Plant (KhPZ). The prototype tank, designated A-20, had a modified BA-20 engine and was specified with of armour, a 45 mm (1.77 in) gun, the production model used a Model V-2-34 engine, a less-flammable diesel fuel in a V12 configuration designed by Konstantin Chelpan. It also had an 8×6-wheel convertible drive similar to the BT tank&#x27;s 8×2, which allowed it to run on wheels without caterpillar tracks. This feature had greatly saved on maintenance and repair of the unreliable tank tracks of the early 1930s, and allowed tanks to exceed on roads, but gave no advantage in combat and its complexity made it difficult to maintain. By 1937–38, track design had improved and the designers considered it a waste of space, weight, and maintenance resources, despite the road speed advantage. The A-20 also incorporated previous research (BT-IS and BT-SW-2 projects) into sloped armour: its all-round sloped armour plates were more likely to deflect rounds than perpendicular armour.

During the Battle of Lake Khasan in July 1938 and the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939, an undeclared border war with Japan on the frontier with occupied Manchuria, the Soviets deployed numerous tanks against the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). Although the IJA Type 95 &quot;Ha&quot;-&quot;Go&quot; light tanks had diesel engines, the Red Army&#x27;s T-26 and BT tanks used petrol engines which, while common in tank designs of the time, often burst into flames when hit by IJA tank-killer teams using Molotov cocktails. Poor-quality welds in the Soviet armour plates left small gaps between them, and flaming petrol from the Molotov cocktails easily seeped into the fighting and engine compartment; portions of the armour plating that had been assembled with rivets also proved to be vulnerable. The Soviet tanks were also easily destroyed by the Japanese Type 95 tank&#x27;s 37 mm gunfire, despite the low velocity of that gun, or &quot;at any other slightest provocation&quot;. The use of riveted armour led to a problem whereby the impact of enemy shells, even if they failed to disable the tank or kill the crew on their own, would cause the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank.
After these battles, Koshkin convinced Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to let him develop a second prototype, a more heavily armed and armoured &quot;universal tank&quot; that reflected the lessons learned and could replace both the T-26 and the BT tanks. Koshkin named the second prototype A-32, after its of frontal armour. It had an L-10 76.2 mm (3 in) gun, and the same Model V-2-34 diesel. Both were tested in field trials at Kubinka in 1939, with the heavier A-32 proving to be as mobile as the A-20. A still heavier version of the A-32, with 45 mm (1.77 in) of front armour, wider tracks, and a newer L-11 76.2 mm gun, was approved for production as the T-34. Koshkin chose the name after the year 1934, when he began to formulate his ideas about the new tank, and to commemorate that year&#x27;s decree expanding the armoured force and appointing Sergo Ordzhonikidze to head tank production.

Valuable lessons from Lake Khasan and Khalkhin Gol regarding armour protection, mobility, quality welding, and main guns were incorporated into the new T-34 tank, which represented a substantial improvement over the BT and T-26 tanks in all four areas. Koshkin&#x27;s team completed two prototype T-34s in January 1940. In April and May, they underwent a grueling drive from Kharkiv to Moscow for a demonstration for the Kremlin leaders, to the Mannerheim Line in Finland, and back to Kharkiv via Minsk and Kiev. Some drivetrain shortcomings were identified and corrected.

===Initial production===
Resistance from the military command and concerns about high production cost were finally overcome by anxieties about the poor performance of Soviet tanks in the Winter War in Finland, and the effectiveness of German tanks during the Battle of France. The first production T-34s were completed in September 1940, completely replacing the production of the T-26, the BT series and the multi-turreted T-28 medium tank at the KhPZ plant. Koshkin died of pneumonia (exacerbated by the drive from Kharkiv to Moscow) at the end of that month, and the T-34&#x27;s drivetrain developer, Alexander Morozov, was appointed Chief Designer.

The T-34 posed new challenges for the Soviet industry. It had heavier armour than any medium tank produced to date, and there were problems with defective armour plates. Only company commanders&#x27; tanks could be fitted with radios (originally the 71-TK-3 radio set), due to their expense and short supply – the rest of the tank crews in each company signalled with flags. The L-11 gun did not live up to expectations, so the Grabin Design Bureau at Gorky Factory N.92 designed the superior 76.2 mm F-34 gun. No bureaucrat would approve production of the new gun, but Gorky and KhPZ started producing it anyway; official permission came from the State Defense Committee only after troops praised the weapon&#x27;s performance in combat against the Germans.

Production of this first T-34 series – the Model 1940 – totalled only about 400, before production was switched to the Model 1941, with the F-34 gun, 9-RS radio set (also installed on the SU-100), and even thicker armour.

===Mass production===

Subassemblies for the T-34 originated at several plants: Kharkiv Diesel Factory N.75 supplied the model V-2-34 engine, Leningrad Kirovsky Factory (formerly the Putilov works) made the original L-11 gun, and the Dinamo Factory in Moscow produced electrical components. Tanks were initially built at Plant N.183, in early 1941 at the Stalingrad Tractor Factory (STZ), and starting in July at Krasnoye Sormovo Factory N.112 in Gorky.

After Germany&#x27;s surprise invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), the Wehrmacht&#x27;s rapid advances forced the evacuation and relocation of Soviet tank factories eastwards to the Ural Mountains, an undertaking of immense scale and haste that presented enormous logistic difficulties and was extremely punishing to the workers involved. Alexander Morozov personally supervised the evacuation of all skilled engineers and laborers, machinery and stock from KhPZ to re-establish the factory at the site of the Dzerzhinsky Ural Railcar Factory in Nizhny Tagil, renamed Stalin Ural Tank Factory N.183. The Kirovsky Factory, evacuated just weeks before the Germans surrounded Leningrad, moved with the Kharkiv Diesel Factory to the Stalin Tractor Factory in Chelyabinsk, soon to be nicknamed &quot;Tankograd&quot; (&quot;Tank City&quot;). The workers and machinery from Leningrad&#x27;s Voroshilov Tank Factory N.174 were incorporated into the Ural Factory and the new Omsk Factory N.174. The Ordzhonikidze Ural Heavy Machine Tool Works (UZTM) in Sverdlovsk absorbed workers and machines from several small machine shops in the path of German forces.

While these factories were being rapidly moved, the industrial complex surrounding the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory in Stalingrad continued to work double shifts throughout the period of withdrawal (September 1941 to September 1942) to make up for production lost, and produced 40% of all T-34s during the period. As the factory became surrounded by heavy fighting in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942, the situation there grew desperate: manufacturing innovations were necessitated by material shortages, and stories persist of unpainted T-34 tanks driven out of the factory directly to the battlefields around it. Stalingrad kept up production until September 1942.

Soviet designers were aware of design deficiencies in the tank, but most of the desired remedies would have slowed tank production and so were not implemented: the only changes allowed on the production lines through to 1944 were those to make production simpler and cheaper. New methods were developed for automated welding and hardening the armour plate, including innovations by Prof. Evgeny Paton. The design of the 76.2 mm F-34 gun Model 1941 was reduced from an initial 861 parts to 614. The initial narrow, cramped turrets, both the cast one and the one welded of rolled armour plates bent to shape, were since 1942 gradually replaced with the somewhat less cramped hexagonal one; as it was mostly cast with only a few, simple flat armour plates welded in (roof etc.), this turret was actually faster to produce. Limited rubber supplies led to the adoption of all-steel, internally sprung road wheels, and a new clutch was added to an improved five-speed transmission and engine, improving reliability.

Over two years, the unit production cost of the T-34 was reduced from 269,500 Rbls in 1941, to 193,000 Rbls, and then to 135,000 Rbls.

In 1943, T-34 production had reached an average of 1,300 per month; this was the equivalent of three full-strength tank divisions. By the end of 1945, over 57,300 T-34s had been built: 34,780 T-34 tanks in multiple variants with 76.2 mm guns in 1940–44, and another 22,609 of the revised T-34-85 model in 1944–45. The single largest producer was Factory N.183 (UTZ), building 28,952 T-34s and T-34-85s from 1941 to 1945. The second-largest was Krasnoye Sormovo Factory N.112 in Gorky, with 12,604 in the same period.

At the start of the German-Soviet war, T-34s comprised about four percent of the Soviet tank arsenal, but by the end it made up at least 55% of tank production (based on figures from; Zheltov lists even larger numbers

Following the end of the war, a further 2,701 T-34s were built prior to the end of Soviet production. Under licence, production was restarted in Poland (1951–55) and Czechoslovakia (1951–58), where 1,380 and 3,185 T-34-85s were made, respectively, by 1956. Altogether, as many as 84,070 T-34s are thought to have been built, plus 13,170 self-propelled guns built on T-34 chassis. It was the most-produced tank of the Second World War, and the second most-produced tank of all time, after its successor, the T-54/55 series.

== Design==
===Overview===
The T-34 had well-sloped armour, a relatively powerful engine and wide tracks. The initial T-34 version had a powerful 76.2 mm gun, and is often called the T-34/76 (originally a World War II German designation, never used by the Red Army). In 1944, a second major version began production, the T-34-85, with a larger 85 mm gun intended to deal with newer German tanks.

Comparisons can be drawn between the T-34 and the U.S. M4 Sherman tank. Both tanks were the backbone of the armoured units in their respective armies, both nations distributed these tanks to their allies, who also used them as the mainstay of their own armoured formations, and both were upgraded extensively and fitted with more powerful guns. Both were designed for mobility and ease of manufacture and maintenance, sacrificing some performance for these goals. Both chassis were used as the foundation for a variety of support vehicles, such as armour recovery vehicles, tank destroyers, and self-propelled artillery. Both were an approximately even match for the standard German medium tank, the Panzer IV, though each of these three tanks had particular advantages and weaknesses compared with the other two. Neither the T-34 nor the M4 was a match for Germany&#x27;s heavier tanks, the Panther (technically a medium tank) or the Tiger I; the Soviets used the IS-2 heavy tank and the U.S. used the M26 Pershing as the heavy tanks of their forces instead.

Dimensions, road speed and engine horsepower of the various models did not vary significantly, except for the T-43, which was slower than the T-34.

===Armour===
The heavily sloped armour design made the tank better protected than the armour thickness alone would indicate. The shape also saved weight by reducing the thickness required to achieve equal protection. A few tanks also had appliqué armour of varying thickness welded onto the hull and turret. Tanks thus modified were called &quot;s ekranami&quot; (, &quot;with screens&quot;).

The USSR donated two combat-used Model 1941 T-34s to the United States for testing purposes in late 1942. The examinations, performed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, revealed problems with overall armour build quality, especially of the plate joins and welds, as well as the use of soft steel combined with shallow surface tempering. Leak issues were noted: &quot;In a heavy rain lots of water flows through chinks/cracks, which leads to the disabling of the electrical equipment and even the ammunition&quot;. Earlier models of the T-34, until the Model 1942, had cast turrets whose armour was softer than that of the other parts of the tank, and offered poor resistance even to 37 mm anti-aircraft shells. Early T-34s also suffered from poor quality welds, leading to instances of shells which would not have penetrated the tank under normal circumstances to penetrate anyway. They also suffered from rushed manufacturing, leading to inconsistent protection.

In addition, close examination of the T-34 at the Aberdeen Testing Ground showed that a variety of alloys were used in different portions of the armour on the T-34. &quot;Mn-Si-Mo steels were employed for the thinner rolled armour sections, Cr-Mo steels for the thicker rolled armour sections, Mn-Si-Ni-Cr-Mo steels were employed for both rolled and cast steel components from 2&quot; to 5&quot; in thickness, and Ni-Cr-Mo steels were employed for some of the moderately thick cast armour sections&quot;. The armour was heat-treated in order to prevent penetration by armour-piercing shells, but this also caused it to be structurally weak, as the armor was very hard and thus brittle, resulting in strikes by high explosive shells causing spalling.

Despite these deficiencies, the T-34&#x27;s armour proved problematic for the Germans in the initial stages of the war on the Eastern Front. In one wartime account, a single T-34 came under heavy fire upon encountering one of the most common German anti-tank guns at that stage of the war: &quot;Remarkably enough, one determined 37 mm gun crew reported firing 23 times against a single T-34 tank, only managing to jam the tank’s turret ring.&quot; Similarly, a German report of May 1942 noted the ineffectiveness of their 50 mm gun as well, noting that &quot;Combating the T-34 with the 5 cm KwK tank gun is possible only at short ranges from the flank or rear, where it is important to achieve a hit as perpendicular to the surface as possible.&quot; However, a Military Commissariat Report of the 10th Tank Division, dated 2 August 1941 reported that within 300–400 m the 37 mm Pak 36&#x27;s armour-piercing shot could defeat the frontal armour. According to an examination of damaged T-34 tanks in several repair workshops in August to September 1942, collected by the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Tank Industry in January 1943, 54.3% of all T-34 losses were caused by the German long-barreled 5 cm KwK 39 gun.

As the war went on, the T-34 gradually lost some of its initial advantages. The Germans responded to the T-34 by fielding large numbers of improved anti-tank weapons such as the towed 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun, while hits from 88 mm-armed Tigers, anti-aircraft guns and 8.8 cm Pak 43 anti-tank guns usually proved lethal. In 1942 the German Panzer IVs were refitted with the 7.5 cm KwK 40 due to the inadequate anti-tank performance of previous German tank designs against the T-34. The upgunned Panzer IV posed a serious threat to the T-34-76, being able to penetrate the frontal turret of a T-34-76 at a range of at any angle.

A &quot;Wa Pruef 1&quot; report estimated that, with the target angled 30° sideward, a Panther tank could penetrate the turret of a T-34-85 from the front at ranges up to 2000 m, the mantlet at 1200 m, and the frontal hull armour at 300 m. According to the &quot;Pantherfibel&quot; (the Panther tank manual for its crew), the T-34&#x27;s glacis could be penetrated from 800 m and the mantlet from 1500 m at 30° sideward angle. 

A Waffenamt-Prüfwesen 1 report estimated that with the T-34 angled 30 degrees sidewards and APCBC round, the Tiger I&#x27;s 8.8 cm KwK 36 L/56 would have to close in to to achieve a penetration in the T-34&#x27;s glacis, and could penetrate the frontal turret of a T-34-85 at 1,400 m, the mantlet at 400 m, and the nose at 300 m Ground trials by employees of NIBT Polygon in May 1943 reported that the 88 mm KwK 36 gun could pierce the T-34 frontal hull from 1,500 meters at 90 degrees and cause a disastrous burst effect inside the tank. The examined hull showed cracks, spalling, and delamination due to the poor quality of the armour. It was recommended to increase and improve the quality of welds and armour.

Analysis of destroyed T-34 tanks in the Korean War found that the 76 and 90 mm armour-piercing rounds of the M41 Walker Bulldog and M46 Patton could penetrate the T-34 at most angles from . The maximum range at which the tanks could penetrate the T-34 could not be determined due to a lack of data at higher combat ranges.

In late 1950 a T-34-85 tank was captured by UN forces in the Korean War. An evaluation of the tank was conducted by the US which found that the sloped armour of the T-34 was desirable for deflecting shells. They also concluded that the armour was deemed as satisfactory as armour strength was comparable to US armour of similar hardness and that the quality of the material used was &quot;high-grade&quot;. Similarly, casting was seen as high quality although casting defects were found in the side armour of the tank that negatively affected armour strength. The abundance of gaps in the joints of the armour was seen as an undesirable feature of the tank due to the risk of injury from &quot;entry of bullet splash and shell fragments&quot;.

===Firepower===

The F-34 gun, fitted on the vast majority of T-34s produced through to the beginning of 1944, was able to penetrate any early German tank&#x27;s armour at normal combat ranges. When firing APCR shells, it could pierce at and of armour at The best German tanks of 1941, the Panzer III and Panzer IV, had no more than of flat frontal armour. However by 1942 the Germans had increased the hull armour on the Panzer IV to which provided good protection at normal combat distances. The F-34 also fired an adequate high explosive round.

The gun sights and range finding for the F-34 main gun (either the TMFD-7 or the PT4-7) were rather crude, especially compared to those of their German adversaries, affecting accuracy and the ability to engage at long ranges. As a result of the T-34&#x27;s two-man turret, weak optics and poor vision devices, the Germans noted:

The Germans also noted that the T-34 was very slow to find and engage targets, while their own tanks could typically get off three rounds for every one fired by the T-34. As the war progressed the Germans created heavier tank designs like the Tiger I or Panther which were both immune to the 76mm gun of the T-34 when fired upon from the front. This meant that they could only be penetrated from the sides at ranges of a few hundred metres. Due to low anti-tank performance, the T-34 was upgraded to the T-34-85 model. This model, with its 85 mm (3.35 in) ZiS gun, provided greatly increased firepower compared to the previous T-34&#x27;s 76.2mm gun. The 85 mm gun could penetrate the turret front of a Tiger I tank from and the driver&#x27;s front plate from at the side angle of 30 degrees, and the larger turret enabled the addition of another crew member, allowing the roles of commander and gunner to be separated and increasing the rate of fire and overall effectiveness. The D-5T was capable of penetrating the Tiger I&#x27;s upper hull armour at 1,000 metres. When firing on the frontal armour of the Panther at an angle of 30 degrees sidewards, the T-34-85 could not penetrate its turret at . This meant that the T-34 would have to resort to using tungsten rounds or firing on the weaker sides of the Panther to destroy it.

The greater length of the 85 mm gun barrel – – made it necessary for crews to be careful not to plough it into the ground on bumpy roads or in combat. Tank commander A.K. Rodkin commented: &quot;the tank could have dug the ground with it in the smallest ditch [filling the barrel with dirt]. If you fired it after that, the barrel would open up at the end like the petals of a flower&quot;, destroying the barrel. Standard practice when moving the T-34-85 cross-country in non-combat situations was to fully elevate the gun, or reverse the turret.

During the Korean War, the USA captured a T-34-85. US engineering analysis and testing concluded that the T-34-85 could penetrate at , performing similarly to the HVAP rounds of the M41. The Americans also concluded the maximum range of the gun was , but the effective range was only up to .

===Mobility===
The T-34 was powered by a Model V-2-34 38.8 L V12 Diesel engine of 500 hp (370 kW), giving a top speed of 53 km/h (33 mph). It used the coil-spring Christie suspension of the earlier BT-series tanks, using a &quot;slack track&quot; tread system with a rear-mounted drive sprocket and no system of return rollers for the upper run of track, but dispensed with the heavy and ineffective convertible drive. T-34 tanks equipped with the 4-speed gearbox could only use 4th gear on road, being limited to 3rd on terrain. In the first batch of T-34s, shifting from 2nd to 3rd required a force of 46-112 kg. In September 1941, however, changes were made which lowered the effort to under 31 kg by changing the 3rd gear ratio, which lowered top speed in 3rd gear from 29 km/h to 25 km/h, but made shifting easier. Using the 5-speed gearbox allowed the T-34 to use 4th gear on terrain, with which it could reach 30 km/h. 

The T-34-76&#x27;s ground pressure was around 0.72 kg/cm². Its wide tracks allowed for superior performance on dirt roads and off-road when compared to contemporary tanks. There were, however, still examples of T-34s getting stuck in mud. For example, on February 4th, 1944, the 21st Guards Tank Brigade, equipped with 32 T-34&#x27;s, was ordered to proceed by road to Tolstoye Rogi, a journey of approximately 80 kilometers. Of the 32 tanks, no less than 19 got stuck in the mud or suffered mechanical breakdowns.

===Ergonomics===
The original 76mm armed T-34 suffered from the unsatisfactory ergonomic layout of its crew compartment compared to the later 85mm variant. The two-man turret crew arrangement required the commander to aim and fire the gun, an arrangement common to most Soviet tanks of the day. The two-man turret was &quot;cramped and inefficient&quot; and was inferior to the three-man (commander, gunner, and loader) turret crews of German Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks. The Germans noted the T-34 was very slow to find and engage targets while the Panzers could typically get off three rounds for every one fired by the T-34.

Early in the war, the commander fought at a further disadvantage; the forward-opening hatch and the lack of a turret cupola forced him to observe the battlefield through a single vision slit and traversable periscope. German commanders liked to fight &quot;heads-up&quot;, with their seat raised and having a full field of view – in the T-34 this was impossible. Soviet veterans condemned the turret hatches of the early models. Nicknamed &quot;pirozhok&quot; (&quot;stuffed bun&quot;) because of its characteristic shape, it was heavy and hard to open. The complaints of the crews urged the design group led by Alexander Morozov to switch in August 1942 to using two hatches in the turret.

The loader also had a difficult job due to the lack of a turret basket (a rotating floor that moves as the turret turns); the same fault was present on all German tanks prior to the Panzer IV. The floor under the T-34&#x27;s turret was made up of ammunition stored in small metal boxes, covered by a rubber mat. There were nine ready rounds of ammunition stowed in racks on the sides of the fighting compartment. Once these rounds had been used, the crew had to pull additional ammunition out of the floor boxes, leaving the floor littered with open bins and matting and reducing their performance.

Most of the problems created by the cramped T-34/76 turret, known before the war, were corrected with the provision of a bigger cast three-man turret on the T-34-85 in 1944.

===General reliability===
The T-34&#x27;s wide track and good suspension gave it excellent cross-country performance. Early in the tank&#x27;s life, however, this advantage was greatly reduced by the numerous teething troubles the design displayed: a long road trip could be a lethal exercise for a T-34 tank at the start of the war. When in June 1941, the 8th Mechanised Corps under Dmitry Ryabyshev marched 500 km towards Dubno, the corps lost half of its vehicles. A.V. Bodnar, who was in combat in 1941–42, recalled:

The T-34 gearbox had four forward and one reverse gear, replaced by a five-speed box on the last of the 1943 model of the T-34.

The tracks of early models were the most frequently repaired part. A.V. Maryevski later remembered:

The USSR donated two combat-used Model 1941 T-34s to the United States for testing purposes in late 1942. The examinations, performed at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, highlighted these early faults, which were in turn acknowledged in a 1942 Soviet report on the results of the testing:

Testing at Aberdeen also revealed that engines could grind to a halt from dust and sand ingestion, as the original &quot;Pomon&quot; air filter was almost totally ineffective and had an insufficient air-inflow capacity, starving the combustion chambers of oxygen, lowering compression, and thereby restricting the engine from operating at full capacity. At the time of the Aberdeen testing, the alleged air filter issue was already remedied by the addition of &quot;Cyclone&quot; filters on the Model 1943, and even more efficient &quot;Multi-Cyclone&quot; filters on the T-34-85.

The testing at Aberdeen revealed other problems as well. The turret drive also suffered from poor reliability. The use of poorly machined, low quality steel side friction clutches and the T-34&#x27;s outdated and poorly manufactured transmission meant frequent mechanical failure occurred and that they &quot;create an inhuman harshness for the driver&quot;. A lack of properly installed and shielded radios – if they existed at all – restricted their operational range to under .

Soviet tests on newly built T-34s showed that in April 1943 only 10.1% could complete a 330 km trial and in June ’43 this went down to 7.7%. The percentage stayed below 50% till October 1943 when it rose to 78%, in the next month it dropped to 57% and in the period December ’43 – January ’44 the average was 82%. During February 1944 tests, 79% of tanks reached 300 kilometers, and of the test batches 33% reached 1,000 kilometers. This became immediately apparent to the tank troops. The deputy commander of the 1st Guards Tank Army, P. G. Dyner, commented that tanks in 1943 would reach only 75 percent of their guaranteed life span in engine hours and mileage, but in 1944 they reached 150 percent.

In 1944 June, a report written by the 2. Panzerjäger-Abteilung Company 128 (23. PzDiv.) described experiences acquired during operations with its &quot;Beutepanzer&quot; SU-85 and T-34:

On 29 January 1945, the State Defense Committee approved a decree that extended the service life guarantee of the T-34&#x27;s V-2-34 engine from 200 hours to 250 hours. A report by the 2nd Guards Tank Army in February 1945 revealed that the average engine service life of a T-34 was lower than the official warranty at 185–190 hours. For comparison, the US M4 Sherman had an average engine service life of 195–205 hours.

==Operational history==
===Operation Barbarossa (1941) ===


Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, its invasion of the Soviet Union, on 22 June 1941. At the start of hostilities, the Red Army had 967 T-34 tanks and 508 KV tanks concentrated in five of their twenty-nine mechanized corps. The existence of the T-34 and KV heavy tanks proved a psychological shock to German soldiers, who had expected to face an inferior enemy. The T-34 was superior to any tank the Germans then had in service. The diary of Alfred Jodl seems to express surprise at the appearance of the T-34 in Riga, noting &quot;the surprise at this new and thus unknown &quot;wunder&quot;-armament being unleashed against the German assault divisions&quot;. Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist, called it &quot;the finest tank in the world&quot; and Heinz Guderian affirmed the T-34&#x27;s &quot;vast superiority&quot; over German tanks.

Initially, the Wehrmacht had great difficulty destroying T-34s in combat, as standard German anti-tank weaponry proved ineffective against its heavy, sloped armour. In one of the first known encounters, a T-34 crushed a 3.7 cm PaK 36, destroyed two Panzer IIs, and left a long swathe of destruction in its wake before a howitzer destroyed it at close range. In another incident, a single Soviet T-34 was hit more than 30 times by a battalion-sized contingent of German 37mm and 50mm anti-tank guns, yet survived intact and drove back to its own lines a few hours later. The inability to penetrate the T-34&#x27;s armour led to the Germans&#x27; standard anti-tank gun, the 37 mm PaK 36, being dubbed the &quot;Panzeranklopfgerät&quot; (&quot;tank door knocker&quot;) because the PaK 36 crew simply revealed their presence and wasted their shells without damaging the T-34&#x27;s armour. Anti-tank gunners began aiming at tank tracks, or vulnerable margins on the turret ring and gun mantlet, rather than the bow and turret armour. The Germans were forced to deploy 105 mm field guns and 88 mm anti-aircraft guns in a direct fire role to stop them.

Despite this, the Soviet corps equipped with these new tanks lost most of them within weeks. The combat statistics for 1941 show that the Soviets lost an average of over seven tanks for every German tank lost. The Soviets lost a total of 20,500 tanks in 1941 (approximately 2,300 of them T-34s, as well as over 900 heavy tanks, mostly KVs). The destruction of the Soviet tank force was accomplished not only by the glaring disparity in the tactical and operational skills of the opponents, but also by mechanical defects that afflicted Soviet armour. Besides the poor state of older tanks, the new T-34s and KVs suffered from initial mechanical and design problems, particularly with regard to clutches and transmissions. Mechanical breakdowns accounted for at least 50 percent of the tank losses in the summer fighting, and recovery or repair equipment was not to be found. The shortage of repair equipment and recovery vehicles led the early T-34 crews to enter combat carrying a spare transmission on the engine deck.
Other key factors diminishing the initial impact of T-34s on the battlefield were the poor state of leadership, tank tactics, initial lack of radios in tanks, and crew training; these factors were partially consequences of Stalin&#x27;s purge of the Soviet officer corps in 1937, reducing the army&#x27;s efficiency and morale. This was aggravated as the campaign progressed by the loss of many of the properly trained personnel during the Red Army&#x27;s disastrous defeats early in the invasion. Typical crews went into combat with only basic military training plus 72 hours of classroom instruction; according to historian Steven Zaloga:

===Further action (1942–1943)===
As the invasion progressed, German infantry began receiving increasing numbers of the 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank guns, which were capable of penetrating the T-34&#x27;s armour at long range. Larger numbers of the 88 mm &quot;Flak&quot; guns also arrived, which could easily defeat a T-34 at very long ranges, though their size and general unwieldiness meant that they were often difficult to move into position in the rough Soviet terrain.

At the same time, the Soviets incrementally upgraded the T-34. The Model 1942 featured increased armour on the turret and many simplified components. The Model 1943 (confusingly also introduced in 1942) had yet more armour, as well as increased fuel capacity and more ammunition storage. Also added were an improved engine air filter and a new clutch mated to an improved and more reliable five-speed transmission. Finally, the Model 1943 also had a new, slightly roomier (but still two-man) turret of a distinctive hexagonal shape that was easier to manufacture, derived from the abandoned T-34M project.

The T-34 was essential in resisting the German summer offensive in 1942, and executing the double encirclement manoeuvre that cut off the German Sixth Army at Stalingrad in December 1942. The Sixth Army was surrounded, and eventually surrendered in February 1943, a campaign widely regarded as the turning point of the war on the Eastern Front.

In 1943, the Soviets formed Polish and Czechoslovak armies-in-exile, and these started to receive the T-34 Model 1943 with a hexagonal turret. Like the Soviet forces themselves, the Polish and Czechoslovak tank crews were sent into action quickly with little training, and suffered high casualties.

In July 1943, the Germans launched Operation Citadel, in the region around Kursk, their last major offensive on the Eastern Front in the Second World War. It was the debut of the German Panther tank, although the numbers employed at the resulting Battle of Kursk were small and the brunt of the burden was carried by the Panzer III, StuG III, and Panzer IV. The campaign featured the largest tank battles in history. The high-water mark of the battle was the massive armour engagement at Prokhorovka, which began on 12 July, though the vast majority of armour losses on both sides were caused by artillery and mines, rather than tanks. Over 6,000 fully tracked armoured vehicles, 4,000 combat aircraft, and 2 million men are believed to have participated in these battles.

The Soviet high command&#x27;s decision to focus on one cost-effective design, cutting costs and simplifying production wherever possible while only allowing relatively minor improvements, had proven to be an astute choice for the first two years of the war. However, the battles in the summer of 1943 demonstrated that the 76.2 mm gun of the T-34 was no longer as effective as it was in 1941. Soviet tank crews struggled at longer ranges with the additional frontal armour applied to the later variants of the Panzer III and Panzer IV, and were unable to penetrate the frontal armour of the new German Panther or Tiger I tank at standard combat ranges without tungsten rounds, and had to rely on tactical skill through flanking manoeuvres and combined arms.

===T-34-85===

After improved German Panzer IVs with the high-velocity 7.5cm (2.95 in) KwK 40 gun were encountered in combat in 1942, a project to design an entirely new Soviet tank was begun, with the goals of increasing armour protection while adding modern features like a torsion-bar suspension and a three-man turret. The new tank, the T-43, was intended to be a universal model to replace both the T-34 and the KV-1 heavy tank. However, the T-43 prototype&#x27;s armour, though heavier, was not capable against German 88 mm guns, while its mobility was found to be inferior to the T-34. Finally, although the T-43 shared over 70% of its components with the T-34, manufacturing it would still have required a significant slow-down in production. Consequently, the T-43 was cancelled.

The Germans improved not only the weaponry of their tanks, but their armor as well. Soviet firing tests against a captured Tiger I heavy tank in April 1943 showed that the T-34&#x27;s 76 mm gun could not penetrate the front of the Tiger I at all, and the side only at very close range. A Soviet 85 mm anti-aircraft gun, the M1939 (52-K), was found capable of doing the job, and so derivatives of it were developed for tanks. One of the resulting guns used on the original T-34 85 model (the D-5T) was capable of penetrating the Tiger I&#x27;s upper hull armour at 1,000 metres. It was still not enough to match the Tiger, which could destroy the T-34 from a distance of , but it was a noticeable improvement.

With the T-43 canceled, the Soviet command made the decision to retool the factories to produce an improved version of the T-34. Its turret ring was enlarged from 1,425 mm (56 in) to 1,600 mm (63 in), allowing a larger turret to be fitted supporting the larger 85 mm gun. The prototype T-43&#x27;s turret design was hurriedly adopted by Vyacheslav Kerichev at the Krasnoye Sormovo Factory to fit the T-34. This was a larger three-man turret, with radio (previously in the hull) and observation cupola in the roof. Now the tank commander needed only to command (aided by cupola and radio systems), leaving the operation of the gun to the gunner and the loader. The turret was bigger and less sloped than the original T-34 turret, making it a bigger target (due to the three-man crew and bigger gun), but with thicker 90 mm armour, making it more resistant to enemy fire. The shells were 50% heavier (9 kg) and were much better in the anti-armour role, and reasonable in a general purpose role, though only 55–60 could be carried, instead of 90–100 of the earlier shells. The resulting new tank, the T-34-85, was seen as a compromise between advocates for the T-43 and others who wanted to continue to build as many 76 mm-armed T-34s as possible without interruption.

Production of the T-34-85 began in January 1944 at Factory No. 112, first using the D-5T 85 mm gun. Parallel to the production of the T-34-85 with the D-5T gun, production of the T-34-85 using the S-53 gun (later to be modified and redesignated as the ZIS-S-53 gun) began in February 1944 at Factory No. 112. The improved T-34-85 became the standard Soviet medium tank, with an uninterrupted production run until the end of the war. A T-34-85 initially cost about 30 percent more to produce than a Model 1943, at 164,000 Rbls; by 1945 this had been reduced to 142,000 Rbls during the course of World War II the cost of a T-34 tank had almost halved, from 270,000 Rbls in 1941, while its top speed remained about the same, and its main gun&#x27;s armour penetration and turret frontal armour thickness both nearly doubled.

The T-34-85 gave the Red Army a tank with better armour and mobility than the German Panzer IV tank and StuG III assault gun. While it could not match the armour or weapons of the heavier Panther and Tiger tanks, its improved firepower made it much more effective than earlier models, and overall it was more cost-effective than the heaviest German tanks. In comparison with the T-34-85 program, the Germans instead chose an upgrade path based on the introduction of completely new, expensive, heavier, and more complex tanks, greatly slowing the growth of their tank production and helping the Soviets to maintain a substantial numerical superiority in tanks. By May 1944, T-34-85 production had reached 1,200 tanks per month. In the entire war, production figures for all Panther types reached no more than 6,557, and for all Tiger types (including the Tiger I and Tiger II) 2,027. Production figures for the T-34-85 alone reached 22,559.

On 12 January 1945, a column of Tiger IIs and other tanks from 424th Heavy Panzer Battalion were involved in a short-range engagement with T-34-85 tanks near the village of Lisow. Forty T-34-85 tanks commanded by Colonel N. Zhukov were attacked by the 424th Heavy Panzer battalion, which had been reinforced by 13 Panthers. The Germans permanently lost five Tiger IIs, seven Tiger Is and five Panthers for the loss of four T-34-85 tanks burnt out.

===German use of T-34s===
The German army often employed as much captured materiel as possible and T-34s were not an exception. Large numbers of T-34s were captured in fighting on the Eastern Front though few were T-34-85s. These were designated by the Germans as &quot;Panzerkampfwagen T-34 747(r)&quot;. From late 1941, captured T-34s were transported to a German workshop for repairs and modification to German requirements. In 1943 a local tank factory in Kharkiv was used for this purpose. These were sometimes modified to German standards by the installation of a German commander&#x27;s cupola and radio equipment.

The first captured T-34s entered German service during the summer of 1941. In order to prevent recognition mistakes, large-dimension crosses or even swastikas were painted on the tanks, including on top of the turret, in order to prevent attack by Axis aircraft. Badly damaged tanks were either dug in as pillboxes or were used for testing and training purposes.

After the end of World War II, East Germany continued to utilize the T-34.

===Manchurian campaign (August 1945)===
Just after midnight on 9 August 1945, though the terrain was believed by the Japanese to be impassable by armoured formations, the Soviet Union invaded Japanese-occupied Manchuria. Red Army combined-arms forces achieved complete surprise and used a powerful, deep-penetrating attack in a classic double encirclement pattern, spearheaded by the T-34-85. The opposing Japanese forces had been reduced as elite units had been drawn off to other fronts and the remaining forces were in the middle of a redeployment. The Japanese tanks remaining to face them were all held in the rear and not used in combat; the Japanese had weak support from IJAAF forces, engineering, and communications. Japanese forces were overwhelmed, though some put up resistance. The Japanese emperor transmitted a surrender order on 14 August, but the Kwantung Army was not given a formal cease-fire until 17 August.

===Korean War (1950–1953)===
A full North Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) brigade equipped with about 120 Soviet-supplied T-34-85s spearheaded the invasion of South Korea in June 1950. The WWII-era 2.36-inch bazookas initially used by the US troops in South Korea were useless against the KPA&#x27;s T-34 tanks, as were the 75 mm main guns of the M24 Chaffee light tank. However, following the introduction of heavier and more capable armour into the war by US and UN forces, such as the American M4 Sherman, M26 Pershing and M46 Patton tanks, as well as the British Comet and Centurion tanks, the KPA began to suffer more T-34 tank losses in combat from enemy armour, aside from further losses due to numerous US/UN airstrikes and increasingly-effective anti-tank firepower for US/UN infantry on the ground, such as the then-new 3.5-inch M20 &quot;Super Bazooka&quot; (replacing the earlier 2.36-inch model). By the time the NKPA were forced to withdraw from the south, about 239 T-34s and 74 SU-76 assault guns had been lost or abandoned. After October 1950, NKPA armour was rarely encountered. Despite China&#x27;s entry into the conflict in the following month, no major armour deployments were carried out by them, as the Chinese focus was on massed infantry attacks rather than large-scale armour assaults. Several T-34-85s and a few IS-2 tanks were fielded, primarily dispersed amongst their infantry, thus making armoured engagements with US and UN forces rare from then on.

A Chinese T-34 tank No. 215 from 4th Tank Regiment, 2nd Tank Division, allegedly destroyed four enemy tanks and damaged another M46 Patton tank during its fight from 6 to 8 July 1953. It also destroyed 26 bunkers,9 artillery pieces, and a truck. That tank is now preserved in the Military Museum of the Chinese People&#x27;s Revolution.

In summary, a 1954 US military survey concluded that there were, in all, 119 tanks vs. tank actions involving US Army and US Marine units against North Korean and Chinese forces during the Korean War, with 97 T-34-85 tanks knocked out and another 18 considered probable. American losses were somewhat greater.

===Angolan Civil War (1975–1988)===

One of the last modern conflicts which saw the extensive combat deployment of the T-34-85 was the Angolan Civil War. In 1975, the Soviet Union shipped eighty T-34-85s to Angola as part of its support for the ongoing Cuban military intervention there. Cuban crewmen instructed FAPLA personnel in their operation; other FAPLA drivers and gunners accompanied Cuban crews in an apprentice role.

FAPLA began deploying T-34-85s against the UNITA and FNLA forces on 9 June 1975.
The appearance of FAPLA and Cuban tanks prompted South Africa to reinforce UNITA with a single squadron of Eland-90 armoured cars.

===Other regions and countries===
====Balkans====

In early 1991, the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army possessed 250 T-34-85s, none of which were in active service. During the breakup of Yugoslavia, the T-34-85s were inherited by the national armies of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro and continued to see action during the Yugoslav Wars. Some were also acquired from Yugoslav reserve stocks by Serbian separatist armies, namely the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (SVK) and the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). Most of these tanks were in poor condition at the beginning of the conflict and some were soon rendered unserviceable, likely through inadequate maintenance and lack of spares.

On 3 May 1995, a VRS T-34-85 attacked an UNPROFOR outpost manned by the 21st Regiment of the Royal Engineers in Maglaj, Bosnia, injuring six British peacekeepers, with at least one of them sustaining a permanent disability. A number of T-34s being stored by the VRS at a base in Zvornik were temporarily confiscated by UNPROFOR as part of a local disarmament programme the following year.

====Middle East====
Czechoslovak-produced T-34-85s were used by Egypt in the Arab-Israeli Wars of 1956 and 1967 (Six-Day War) in the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt went on to build the T-34-100, a local and unique conversion that was made up of a Soviet BS-3 100 mm heavy field-artillery gun mounted within a heavily modified turret, as well as the T-34-122 mounting the D-30 gun. In 1956, they were used as regular tanks to support Egyptian infantry, the tank was still in use by the Yom Kippur War in October 1973.
The Syrian Army also received T-34-85s from the Soviet Union and they took part in the many artillery duels with Israeli tanks in November 1964 and in the Six-Day War of 1967.

====Warsaw Pact====
T-34-85s equipped many of the armies of Eastern European countries (later forming the Warsaw Pact) and the armies of other Soviet client-states elsewhere. East German, Hungarian and Soviet T-34-85s served in the suppression of the East German uprising of 17 June 1953 as well as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

====Afghanistan====
T-34-85s were sporadically available in Afghanistan. During the Soviet–Afghan War, most of the T-34s were fielded by the Sarandoy internal security forces. Some were also kept in service with the Army of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.

====China====
After the formation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, the Soviet Union sent many T-34-85s to the PRC&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA). Factory 617 had the ability to produce every part of the T-34-85, and during decades of service many modifications were made that visibly distinguish the PRC T-34-85 from the original specification, but no T-34-85 was actually made in China. The production plan of the T-34-85 in China was ended soon after the PRC received T-54A main battle tanks from the Soviet Union and began to build the Type 59 tank, a licensed production version of the T-54A.

====Cuba====
Cuba received 150 T-34-85 tanks as military aid from the Soviet Union in 1960. The T-34-85 was the first Soviet tank to enter service with the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), along with the IS-2. Many T-34-85 tanks first saw action in April 1961 during the Bay of Pigs Invasion with an unknown number destroyed or knocked out during the battle. In 1975, many T-34-85s were also donated by the USSR to the FAR to support its lengthy intervention in the Angolan Civil War.

A platoon of five Cuban T-34-85s saw combat in Angola against South African troops during the Battle of Cassinga. The tanks were based along with a company of Cuban mechanized infantry equipped with BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers. In May 1978, South Africa launched a major airborne raid on Cassinga with the objective of destroying a SWAPO (South West African People&#x27;s Organisation) base there. The Cuban forces were mobilised to stop them. As they approached Cassinga they were strafed by South African aircraft, which destroyed most of the BTR-152s and three of the T-34-85s; a fourth T-34-85 was disabled by an anti-tank mine buried in the road. The remaining tank continued to engage the withdrawing South African paratroops from a hull down position until the battle was over.

Over a hundred Cuban T-34-85s and their respective crews remained in Angola as of the mid 1980s. In September 1986, Cuban president Fidel Castro complained to General Konstantin Kurochkin, head of the Soviet military delegation to Angola, that his men could no longer be expected to fight South African armour with T-34s of &quot;World War II vintage&quot;; Castro insisted that the Soviets furbish the Cuban forces with a larger quantity of T-55s. By 1987 Castro&#x27;s request appeared to have been granted, as Cuban tank battalions were able to deploy substantial numbers of T-54Bs, T-55s, and T-62s; the T-34-85 was no longer in service.

====Cyprus====
Cypriot National Guard forces equipped with some 35 T-34-85 tanks helped to support a coup by the Greek junta against President Archbishop Makarios on 15 July 1974. They also saw extensive action against Turkish forces during the Turkish invasion in July and August 1974, with two major actions at Kioneli and at Kyrenia on 20 July 1974.

====Namibia====
In 1984, the South West African People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO) made a concerted attempt to establish its own conventional armoured battalion through its armed wing, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). As part of this effort, SWAPO diplomatic representatives in Europe approached the German Democratic Republic with a request for ten T-34 tanks, which were delivered. PLAN T-34s were never deployed during offensive operations against the South African military, being confined to the role of protecting strategic bases inside northern Angola.

By 1988 the PLAN T-34-85s had been stationed near Luanda, where their crews received training from Cuban instructors. In March 1989, the PLAN tanks were mobilised and moved south towards the Namibian border. South Africa accused PLAN of planning a major offensive to influence Namibia&#x27;s pending general elections, but the tank crews did not cross the border and refrained from intervening in a series of renewed clashes later that year. Between 1990 and 1991, SWAPO ordered the PLAN tanks in Angola repatriated to Namibia at its own expense. Four later entered service with the new Namibian Army.

====Finland====
The Soviet and Finnish armies used T-34s until the 1960s; the former included the 76.2 mm-armed versions until at least 1968, when they were used in filming the sequel to the movie &quot;The Alive and the Dead&quot;. The Finnish tanks were captured directly from the Soviets or purchased from Germany&#x27;s captured stocks. Many of the Т-34-85s were enhanced with Finnish or Western equipment, such as improved optics.

====Vietnam====
During the Vietnam War, the North Vietnamese Army was equipped with many Soviet T-34-85 and these were used in the Operation Lam Son 719, the 1972 Easter Offensive and the 1975 Spring Offensive. They were later used during the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and the Sino-Vietnamese War. A small number are currently being used as trainers. The rest are in storage and no longer serve as active duty battle tanks.

====Yemen====
In 2015, both T-34-85 Model 1969 tanks and SU-100 self-propelled guns were photographed being used in Houthi takeover in Yemen. Some were even being fitted with anti-tank guided missiles.

===Current active service===
In 2018, there were nine countries that maintained T-34s in the inventories of their national armed forces: Cuba, Yemen, the Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Namibia, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam. Of these operators, Vietnam possessed the largest known surviving fleet of T-34 series tanks, with 45. Yemen possessed 30, Guinea 30, Guinea-Bissau 10, Mali 21, and Laos 30. It was unclear how many Cuban and North Korean T-34s remained in service. All the Congolese, Namibian and Malian tanks were believed to be in reserve storage or inoperable. The Laotian Army retired its T-34s in early 2019 and sold them to Russia, to be used for public displays and museum exhibits.

===Successors===
In 1944, pre-war development of a more advanced T-34 tank was resumed, leading to the T-44. The new tank had a turret design based on the T-34-85&#x27;s, but featured a new hull with torsion-bar suspension and transversely mounted engine; it had a lower profile than the T-34-85 and was simpler to manufacture. Between 150 and 200 of these tanks were built before the end of the war. With substantial drivetrain changes, a new turret, and 100 mm gun, it became the T-54, starting production in 1947.

==Symbolism==

In Russia, in both 2023 and 2024, a single T-34-85 appeared as the sole tank in the Victory Day Parade held in Red Square in Moscow, leading to ridicule from Western media.

A T-34-85 tank monument in the East German city of Chemnitz (then known as Karl-Marx-Stadt) became the target of a 1980 bomb-attack that inflicted minor damage on the vehicle and blew out nearby windows. The bomber, Josef Kneifel, was sentenced to life imprisonment in Bautzen, but was released after a deal with the West German government in 1987. After German unification in 1990, the tank was transferred to a museum in Ingolstadt.

Another such tank, mounted atop the monument to Soviet tank crews in Prague, was the focus of significant controversy. The monument (known locally as &#x27;Saint Tank&#x27;) was intended to represent Lt I.G. Goncharenko&#x27;s T-34-85 (the first Soviet tank to enter Prague during the liberation of Czechoslovakia in May 1945), but actually bore an IS-2M heavy tank. To many in Prague, the tank was also a reminder of the Soviet invasion which ended the Prague Spring of 1968. The tank was painted pink by artist David Černý in 1991. Following an official protest from the Russian government, the arrest of Černý, a coat of official green paint, public demonstrations, and a further coat of pink paint applied by fifteen parliamentary deputies, the tank was finally removed to a military museum.

&quot;Czterej pancerni i pies&quot; (&quot;Four Tank-men and a Dog&quot;), a very successful war-themed Polish television series of the 1960s, adapted the novel of the same name by the Polish writer Janusz Przymanowski (1922–1998), himself a People&#x27;s Army of Poland volunteer. The series made T-34 tank number 102 an icon of Polish popular culture. It was also shown in other Soviet-bloc countries where it was also well received, surprisingly even in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). At the beginning of the 21st century reruns of the black and white series still manage to attract a large audience.

In Budapest on 23 October 2006, the 2006 protests in Hungary climaxed during the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Protesters managed to start an unarmed T-34 tank which was part of a memorial exhibit, and used it in riots against police forces. The tank drove a few hundred metres, then stopped in front of the police, causing no personal injury.
==Variants==
There were two main production families of the T-34, each with subvariants. The identification of T-34 variants can be complicated. Turret castings, superficial details, and equipment differed between factories; new features were added in the middle of production runs, or retrofitted to older tanks; damaged tanks were rebuilt, sometimes with the addition of newer-model equipment and even new turrets.

The Red Army never had a consistent policy for naming the T-34. Since at least the 1980s, however, many academic sources (notably, AFV expert Steven Zaloga) have used Soviet-style nomenclature: &quot;T-34&quot; for the models armed with 76.2 mm guns, and &quot;T-34-85&quot; for models armed with 85 mm guns, with minor models distinguished by year, as &quot;T-34 Model 1940&quot;. Some Russian historians use different names: they refer to the first T-34 as the &quot;T-34 Model 1939&quot; instead of 1940, all T-34s with the original turret and F-34 gun as &quot;Model 1941&quot; instead of Models 1941 and 1942, and the hexagonal-turret T-34 as &quot;Model 1942&quot; instead of 1943.

German military intelligence in World War II referred to the two main production families as &quot;T-34/76&quot; and &quot;T-34/85&quot;, with subvariants receiving letter designations such as &quot;T-34/76A&quot; – this nomenclature has been widely used in the West, especially in popular literature. When the German Wehrmacht used captured T-34s, it designated them &quot;Panzerkampfwagen T-34(r)&quot;, where the &quot;r&quot; stood for &quot;russisch&quot; (&quot;Russian&quot;). The Finns referred to the T-34 as the &quot;Sotka&quot; after the common goldeneye, because the side silhouette of the tank resembled a swimming waterfowl. The T-34-85 was called &quot;pitkäputkinen Sotka&quot; (&quot;long-barreled Sotka&quot;).

The T-34 (German designation: T-34/76) was the original tank with a 76.2 mm gun in a two-man turret.
* Model 1940 (T-34/76A): Early, small production run (about 400 built) with the L-11 76.2 mm tank gun.
* Model 1941 (T-34/76B): Main production with thicker armour and the superior F-34 76.2 mm gun.
* Model 1942 (T-34/76C): Thicker armour, many minor manufacturing improvements.
* Model 1943 (T-34/76D, E, and F): Introduced May 1942 (not 1943). More ammunition and fuel, very minor armour increase. New hexagonal turret, nicknamed &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; by the Germans because of its appearance with the twin, round turret-roof hatches open. Later production had a new commander&#x27;s cupola.

The T-34-85 (German designation: T-34/85) was a major improvement with an 85 mm gun in a three-man turret. All T-34-85 models are externally very similar.
* Model 1943: Short production run of January–March 1944 with D-5T 85 mm gun.
* Model 1944: Produced from March 1944 through to the end of that year, with simpler ZiS-S-53 85 mm gun, radio moved from the hull into a turret with improved layout and new gunner&#x27;s sight.
* Model 1945: Produced from 1944 to 1945, with an electrically powered turret traverse motor, an enlarged commander&#x27;s cupola with a one-piece hatch, and the TDP smoke system with electrically detonated MDSh canisters. Most produced variant of the T-34-85.
* Model 1946: Production model with the improved V-2-34M engine, new wheels, and other minor details.
* Model 1960: A refurbishing program introduced a new V-2-3411 engine and other modernizations.
* Model 1969 (also called T-34-85M): Another refurbishing program introducing night driving equipment, additional fuel, and other modernizations.

===Other armoured fighting vehicles===

* Flame-thrower tanks: OT-34 and OT-34-85 had an internally mounted flamethrower ATO-41 (ATO-42 later) replacing the hull machine-gun. 1170 OT-34-76 (mostly based on 1942/43 versions) and 331 OT-34-85 were built.
* PT-1 T-34/76: &quot;Protivominniy Tral&quot; (&quot;counter-mine trawl&quot;) Mine roller tank, mostly built on T-34 Model 1943 or T-34-85 chassis.
* &quot;Samokhodnaya Ustanovka&quot; (Self-propelled guns and tank destroyers):
** SU-122, a self-propelled howitzer based on T-34 Model 1943 chassis.
** SU-85, a tank destroyer based on T-34 Model 1943 chassis.
** SU-100, a tank destroyer based on T-34-85 chassis.
* T-34-57: 14 T-34s were fitted with the 57-mm ZiS-4 (1941, 10 tanks) or the ZIS-4M (1943/44, 4 tanks) high-velocity 57 mm gun to be used as tank destroyers.

==Surviving vehicles==

An enormous number of T-34s and T-34-85s were produced; the Soviets used them aggressively in campaigns in Europe and Asia, and they were distributed to the Soviets&#x27; allies all over the world. Due to all three factors, there are hundreds of surviving T-34s. Examples of this tank are in the collections of most significant military museums, and hundreds more serve as war memorials. Many are in private ownership, and demilitarised working tanks change hands for U.S. $20,000–40,000. Some still may serve in a second-line capacity in a number of Third World militaries, while others may find use in a civilian capacity, primarily in film-making. In many World War II films, such as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot;, and &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, T-34-85 tanks were modified to resemble Tiger I tanks, due to the rarity of the latter. In Sydney Pollack&#x27;s 1969 movie &quot;Castle Keep&quot;, barely modified T-34-85 tanks were used as German tanks.

In 2000, a T-34 Model 1943 was recovered that had spent 56 years at the bottom of a bog in Estonia. The tank had been captured and used by retreating German troops, who dumped it in the swamp when it ran out of fuel. The anaerobic environment of the bog preserved the tank and ensured there were no signs of oil leakage, rust, or other significant water damage. The engine was restored to full working order.

Other significant surviving T-34s include a Model 1941 at the Aberdeen Proving Ground (intersection of Deer Creek Loop and Target Loop) in Maryland, one of the oldest surviving vehicles. The French Musée des Blindés at Saumur holds two T-34s, including one in full working condition that is displayed in action at its summer &quot;Carrousel&quot; live tank exhibition. The Mandela Way T-34 Tank, a privately owned T-34-85 named after the street in which it is sited (in Bermondsey, London), is frequently repainted by artists and graffitists. In the United States, an operational T-34-85 is located at DriveTanks, on the Ox Ranch Property in Texas. Visitors to DriveTanks can pay to drive the T-34, as well as fire the main gun. This T-34 is reported to have served on the Eastern Front during the Russian march to take Berlin.

<text>Michael Joseph Behe ( ; born January 18, 1952) is an American biochemist and an advocate of the pseudoscientific principle of intelligent design (ID). 

Behe serves as professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and as a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture. He advocates for the validity of the argument for irreducible complexity (IC), which claims that some biochemical structures are too complex to be explained by known evolutionary mechanisms and are therefore probably the result of intelligent design. Behe has testified in several court cases related to intelligent design, including the court case &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, where his views were cited in the ruling that intelligent design is not science and is religious in nature.

Behe&#x27;s claims about the irreducible complexity of essential cellular structures have been rejected by the vast majority of the scientific community, and his own biology department at Lehigh University published a statement repudiating Behe&#x27;s views and intelligent design.

==Early life and education==
Behe was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Bishop McDevitt High School. He graduated from Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1974 with a B.S. in chemistry. He received his Ph.D. in biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1978 for his dissertation research on sickle-cell disease. 

From 1978 to 1982, he did postdoctoral work on DNA structure at the National Institutes of Health. From 1982 to 1985, he was assistant professor of chemistry at Queens College in New York City, where he met his wife, Celeste. In 1985, he moved to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where he is currently a professor of biochemistry. From 2005 to 2024, Lehigh University&#x27;s department of biological sciences exhibited a position statement on its website stating that its faculty reject Behe&#x27;s views on evolution:

As of 2024, his faculty webpage states: &quot;My arguments about irreducible complexity and intelligent design are my own, and are not endorsed either by Lehigh University in general or by the Department of Biological Sciences in particular.&quot;

==Career==

Behe says he once fully accepted the scientific theory of evolution, but that after reading &quot;&quot; (1985), by Michael Denton, he came to question evolution. Later, Behe came to believe that there was evidence, at a biochemical level, that some biological systems were &quot;irreducibly complex&quot;. He thought that these systems could not, even in principle, have evolved by natural selection. He believed that the only possible alternative explanation for such complex structures was that they were created by an &quot;intelligent designer&quot;. Irreducible complexity has been rejected by the scientific community.

The 1987 &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; U.S. Supreme Court decision barred the required teaching of creation science from public schools but allowed evolutionary theory on the grounds of scientific validity. After the decision, a later draft of the textbook &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot; (1989) systematically replaced each and every cognate of the word &quot;creation&quot; with the phrase &quot;intelligent design&quot; or similar ID terms. The books of lawyer Phillip E. Johnson on theistic realism dealt directly with criticism of evolutionary theory and its purported biased &quot;materialist&quot; science, and aimed to legitimize the teaching of creationism in schools. In March 1992, a conference at Southern Methodist University brought Behe together with other leading figures into what Johnson later called the &quot;wedge strategy.&quot; In 1993, the &quot;Johnson-Behe cadre of scholars&quot; met at Pajaro Dunes, California, and Behe presented for the first time his idea of irreducibly complex molecular machinery. Following a summer 1995 conference, &quot;The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture,&quot; the group obtained funding through the Discovery Institute. 

For the 1993 edition of &quot;Pandas&quot;, Behe wrote a chapter on blood clotting, presenting arguments which he later presented in very similar terms in a chapter in his 1996 book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Black Box&quot;. Behe later agreed that they were essentially the same when he defended intelligent design at the Dover trial.

In 1996, Behe became a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, later renamed the Center for Science and Culture, an organization dedicated to promoting intelligent design.

===&quot;Darwin&#x27;s Black Box&quot;===

In 1996, Behe published his ideas on irreducible complexity in his book &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Black Box&quot;. Behe&#x27;s refusal to identify the nature of any proposed intelligent designer frustrates scientists, who see it as a move to avoid any possibility of testing the positive claims of ID while allowing him and the intelligent design movement to distance themselves from some of the more overtly religiously motivated critics of evolution.

As to the identity of the intelligent designer, Behe responds that if, deep in the woods, one were to come across a group of flowers that clearly spelled out the name &quot;LEHIGH&quot;, one would have no doubt that the pattern was the result of intelligent design. Determining who the designer was, however, would not be nearly as easy. 

In 1997, Russell Doolittle, on whose work Behe based much of the blood-clotting discussion in &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Black Box,&quot; wrote a rebuttal to the statements about irreducible complexity of certain systems. In particular, Doolittle mentioned the issue of the blood clotting in his article, &quot;A Delicate Balance.&quot; Later on, in 2003, Doolittle&#x27;s lab published a paper in the peer-reviewed journal &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; which demonstrates that the pufferfish lacks at least three out of 26 blood clotting factors, yet still has a workable blood clotting system. According to Doolittle, this defeats a key claim in Behe&#x27;s book, that blood clotting is irreducibly complex.

In reviewing a book by Robert T. Pennock, Behe took issue with the &quot;intelligent design&quot; group being associated with &quot;creationism,&quot; saying readers would typically take that to mean biblical literalism and young Earth creationism (YEC). In 2001 Pennock responded that he had been careful to represent their views correctly, and that while several leaders of the intelligent design movement were young Earth creationists, others including Behe were &quot;old-earthers&quot; and &quot;creationists in the core sense of the term, namely, that they reject the scientific, evolutionary account of the origin of species and want to replace it with a form of special creation.&quot;

===Behe and Snoke article===
In 2004, Behe published a paper with David Snoke, in the scientific journal &quot;Protein Science&quot; that uses a simple mathematical model to simulate the rate of evolution of proteins by point mutation, which he states supports irreducible complexity, based on the calculation of the probability of mutations required for evolution to succeed. However, the paper does not mention intelligent design nor irreducible complexity, which were removed, according to Behe, at the behest of the reviewers. Nevertheless, the Discovery Institute lists it as one of the &quot;Peer-Reviewed &amp; Peer-Edited Scientific Publications Supporting the Theory of Intelligent Design.&quot;

Michael Lynch authored a response, to which Behe and Snoke responded. &quot;Protein Science&quot; discussed the papers in an editorial.

Numerous scientists have debunked the work, pointing out that not only has it been shown that a supposedly irreducibly complex structure can evolve, but that it can do so within a reasonable time even subject to unrealistically harsh restrictions, and noting that Behe and Snoke&#x27;s paper does not properly include natural selection and genetic redundancy. When the issue raised by Behe and Snoke is tested in the modern framework of evolutionary biology, numerous simple pathways to complexity have been shown. In their response, Behe and Snoke assumed that intermediate mutations are always damaging, where modern science allows for neutral or positive mutations. Some of the critics have also noted that the Discovery Institute continues to claim the paper as &#x27;published evidence for design,&#x27; despite its offering no design theory nor attempting to model the design process, and therefore not providing an alternative to random chance.

Many of Behe&#x27;s statements have been challenged by biologist Kenneth R. Miller in his book, &quot;Finding Darwin&#x27;s God&quot; (1999). Behe has subsequently disputed Miller&#x27;s points in an online essay.

===&quot;The Edge of Evolution&quot;===

In 2007, Behe&#x27;s book &quot;The Edge of Evolution&quot; was published arguing that while evolution can produce changes within species, there is a limit to the ability of evolution to generate diversity, and this limit (the &quot;edge of evolution&quot;) is somewhere between species and orders.

In this book Behe&#x27;s central assertion is that Darwinian evolution actually exists but plays only a limited role in the development and diversification of life on Earth. To this aim, he examines the genetic changes undergone by the malaria plasmodium genome and the human genome in response to each other&#x27;s biological defenses, and identifies that &quot;the situation resembles trench warfare, not an arms race&quot;, by considering the hemoglobin-destroying, protein pump-compromising as a &quot;war by attrition&quot;. Starting from this example, he takes into account the number of mutations required to &quot;travel&quot; from one genetic state to another, as well as population size for the organism in question. Then, Behe calculates what he calls the &quot;edge of evolution&quot;, i.e., the point at which Darwinian evolution would no longer be an efficacious agent of creative biological change, arguing that purposeful design plays a major role in the development of biological complexity, through the mechanism of producing &quot;non-random mutations&quot;, which are then subjected to the sculpting hand of natural selection

The book was reviewed, by prominent scientists in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;Science&quot;, and &quot;Nature&quot; who were highly critical of the work noting that Behe appears to accept almost all of evolutionary theory, barring random mutation, which is replaced with guided mutation at the hand of an unnamed designer. The book earned Behe the Pigasus Award for the year 2007.

=== &quot;Darwin Devolves&quot; ===
Behe also promotes intelligent design in his 2019 book, &quot;Darwin Devolves&quot; whose central premise is that the combination of random mutation and natural selection, apart from being incapable of generating novelty, is mainly a degradative force. Like his previous books, &quot;Darwin Devolves&quot; received negative reviews from the scientific community, including a scathing review in &quot;Science&quot; by Nathan H. Lents, Richard Lenski, and S. Joshua Swamidass, a harsh critique by Jerry Coyne in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and a scholarly rebuttal in &quot;Evolution&quot; from Gregory Lang and Amber Rice, Behe&#x27;s colleagues at Lehigh University. Lents said of &quot;Darwin Devolves&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Evolution&quot;: &quot;his [ ] two books totally missed their marks and were easily dismissed by the scientific community.&quot;

Lang and Rice&#x27;s assessment noted that while Behe rightfully acknowledges that organisms have common ancestry, it is posited that a designer is required for more distant relationships like at the family level, and that the presentation of degradative processes is exaggerated with evidence of beneficial adaptations dodged. The article also criticized the use of false analogies and neglecting evidence of new genetic raw material production for evolution (&quot;Behe is correct that the loss of genetic information is an important mechanism. However, the opposing processes of gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and introgression balance out gene loss, providing a source of new genetic material&quot;). They then concluded with examples of adaptation that contradict the book&#x27;s conclusions and expound on the flaws of Irreducible Complexity, adding that &quot;why evolution by natural selection is difficult for so many to accept is beyond the scope of this review; however, it is not for a lack of evidence.&quot;

===Publications===
Behe has written for the &quot;Boston Review&quot;, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times.&quot;

==Court cases==
=== Dover testimony ===

In &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District,&quot; the first direct challenge brought in United States federal courts to an attempt to mandate the teaching of intelligent design on First Amendment grounds, Behe was called as a primary witness for the defense and asked to support the idea that intelligent design was legitimate science. Some of the most crucial exchanges in the trial occurred during Behe&#x27;s cross-examination, where his testimony would prove devastating to the defense. Behe was forced to concede that &quot;there are no peer reviewed articles by anyone advocating for intelligent design supported by pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred&quot; and that his definition of &#x27;theory&#x27; as applied to intelligent design was so loose that astrology would also qualify. Earlier during his direct testimony, Behe had argued that a computer simulation of evolution he performed with Snoke shows that evolution is not likely to produce certain complex biochemical systems. Under cross examination however, Behe was forced to agree that &quot;the number of prokaryotes in 1 ton of soil are 7 orders of magnitude higher than the population [it would take] to produce the disulfide bond&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s entirely possible that something that couldn&#x27;t be produced in the lab in two years... could be produced over three and half billion years.&quot;

Many of Behe&#x27;s critics have pointed to these exchanges as examples they believe further undermine Behe&#x27;s statements about irreducible complexity and intelligent design. John E. Jones III, the judge in the case, would ultimately rule that intelligent design is not scientific in his 139-page decision, citing Behe&#x27;s testimony extensively as the basis for his findings:
*&quot;Consider, to illustrate, that Professor Behe remarkably and unmistakably claims that the plausibility of the argument for ID depends upon the extent to which one believes in the existence of God.&quot;
*&quot;As no evidence in the record indicates that any other scientific proposition&#x27;s validity rests on belief in God, nor is the Court aware of any such scientific propositions, Professor Behe&#x27;s assertion constitutes substantial evidence that in his view, as is commensurate with other prominent ID leaders, ID is a religious and not a scientific proposition.&quot;
*&quot;First, defense expert Professor Fuller agreed that ID aspires to &#x27;change the ground rules&#x27; of science and lead defense expert Professor Behe admitted that his broadened definition of science, which encompasses ID, would also embrace astrology. Moreover, defense expert Professor Minnich acknowledged that for ID to be considered science, the ground rules of science have to be broadened to allow consideration of supernatural forces.&quot;
*&quot;What is more, defense experts concede that ID is not a theory as that term is defined by the NAS and admit that ID is at best &#x27;fringe science&#x27; which has achieved no acceptance in the scientific community.&quot;
*&quot;We therefore find that Professor Behe&#x27;s claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large.&quot;
*&quot;ID proponents primarily argue for design through negative arguments against evolution, as illustrated by Professor Behe&#x27;s argument that &#x27;irreducibly complex&#x27; systems cannot be produced through Darwinian, or any natural, mechanisms. However, … arguments against evolution are not arguments for design. Expert testimony revealed that just because scientists cannot explain today how biological systems evolved does not mean that they cannot, and will not, be able to explain them tomorrow. As Dr. Padian aptly noted, &#x27;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&#x27;… Irreducible complexity is a negative argument against evolution, not proof of design, a point conceded by defense expert Professor Minnich.&quot;
*&quot;Professor Behe&#x27;s concept of irreducible complexity depends on ignoring ways in which evolution is known to occur. Although Professor Behe is adamant in his definition of irreducible complexity when he says a precursor &#x27;missing a part is by definition nonfunctional,&#x27; what he obviously means is that it will not function in the same way the system functions when all the parts are present. For example in the case of the bacterial flagellum, removal of a part may prevent it from acting as a rotary motor. However, Professor Behe excludes, by definition, the possibility that a precursor to the bacterial flagellum functioned not as a rotary motor, but in some other way, for example as a secretory system.&quot;
*&quot;Professor Behe has applied the concept of irreducible complexity to only a few select systems: (1) the bacterial flagellum; (2) the blood-clotting cascade; and (3) the immune system. Contrary to Professor Behe&#x27;s assertions with respect to these few biochemical systems among the myriad existing in nature, however, Dr. Miller presented evidence, based upon peer-reviewed studies, that they are not in fact irreducibly complex.&quot;
*&quot;In fact, on cross-examination, Professor Behe was questioned concerning his 1996 claim that science would never find an evolutionary explanation for the immune system. He was presented with fifty-eight peer-reviewed publications, nine books, and several immunology textbook chapters about the evolution of the immune system; however, he simply insisted that this was still not sufficient evidence of evolution, and that it was not &quot;good enough.&quot;
*&quot;With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designer&#x27;s identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. ... In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. Professor Behe&#x27;s only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies.&quot;

Jones would later say that Eric Rothschild&#x27;s cross examination of Behe was &quot;as good a cross-examination of an expert witness as I have ever seen. It was textbook.&quot;

===&quot;ACSI v. Roman Stearns&quot;===
Behe received $20,000 for testifying as an expert witness on behalf of the plaintiffs in &quot;Association of Christian Schools International v. Roman Stearns.&quot; The case was filed by Association of Christian Schools International, which argued that the University of California was being discriminatory by not recognizing science classes that use creationist books. The 2005 filing claimed that University of California&#x27;s rejection of several of their courses was illegal &quot;viewpoint discrimination and content regulation prohibited by the Free Speech Clause.&quot; In 2007, Behe&#x27;s expert witness report claimed that the Christian textbooks, including William S. Pinkston, Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Biology for Christian Schools&quot; (1980; 2nd ed. 1994), are excellent works for high school students. He defended that view in a deposition.

In August 2008, Judge S. James Otero rejected Behe&#x27;s claims, saying that Behe &quot;submitted a declaration concluding that the BJU [Bob Jones University Press] text mentions standard scientific content. ... However, Professor Behe &#x27;did not consider how much detail or depth&#x27; the texts gave to this standard content.&quot; Otero ruled in favor of the University of California&#x27;s decision to reject courses using these books.

==Personal life==
Behe is a Catholic. He is married to Celeste Behe and they have nine children who are homeschooled.

<doc id="186208" wikidata="Q2814" url="?curid=186208" title="Halle (Saale)">
<text>Halle (Saale), or simply Halle (; from the 15th to the 17th century: &quot;Hall in Sachsen&quot;; until the beginning of the 20th century: &quot;Halle an der Saale&quot; ; from 1965 to 1995: &quot;Halle/Saale&quot;), is the largest city of the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. It is the fifth-most populous city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden and Chemnitz, as well as the 31st-largest city of Germany. With around 244,000 inhabitants, it is slightly more populous than the state capital, Magdeburg. With Leipzig, the largest city of Saxony, Halle forms the polycentric Leipzig-Halle conurbation. Leipzig/Halle International Airport lies between the two cities, in Schkeuditz. The Leipzig-Halle conurbation is at the heart of the larger Central German Metropolitan Region.

Halle lies in the south of Saxony-Anhalt, in the Leipzig Bay, the southernmost part of the North German Plain, and is the largest city on the River Saale (a tributary of the Elbe), which is the third-longest river flowing entirely in Germany after the Weser and the Main. The White Elster flows into the Saale in the southern borough of Silberhöhe. Halle is the fourth-largest city in the Thuringian-Upper Saxon dialect area after Leipzig, Dresden and Chemnitz.

Halle is one of the main economic and educational centers of Central Germany. The Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, with campuses in Halle and Wittenberg, is the largest university in Saxony-Anhalt and one of the oldest universities in Germany. The university hospital of Halle (&quot;Universitätsklinikum Halle (Saale)&quot;) is the largest hospital in the state. The German National Academy of Sciences (&quot;Leopoldina&quot;) has its seat in Halle. Halle is an important radio hub - Halle Radio Tower is Germany&#x27;s second-tallest lattice tower, and at night many public German radio stations from all over the country switch to the broadcasting center of Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk in Halle which is responsible for the night program.

The Halle tramway is one of the most extensive German tramway networks, and Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof is the second-most important hub of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland rapid transit network after Leipzig Hauptbahnhof. The Saale-Elster Viaduct, the longest bridge in Germany and longest high-speed rail bridge in Europe, which is part of the Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway, runs through the southern borough of Planena.

The Nebra sky disc that was discovered in Nebra in the Unstrut valley between Halle and Erfurt, is exhibited in the Halle State Museum of Prehistory. The city is the birthplace of German-British Baroque composer George Frideric Handel, who was born in the Handel House that has been converted into a music museum. The Handel Monument in Halle is the only monument in Germany dedicated to him.

==Geography==
Halle (Saale) is located in the southern part of Saxony-Anhalt in central Germany, along the river Saale which drains the surrounding plains and the greater part of the neighboring Free State of Thuringia just to its south, and the Thuringian basin, northwards from the Thuringian Forest. Leipzig, one of Germany&#x27;s major cities, is only away. Its area is .

===Climate===
Köppen climate classification classifies its climate as oceanic (Cfb). However, it is close to being a cold semi-arid climate (BSk). Using the most current climate data from April 2017 to March 2022, the annual precipitation is 17 mm too much to be classified as a cold semi-arid climate. For example, using the climate data from September 2015 to August 2020, the climate would fulfill the requirements to be classified as a cold semi-arid climate. Notwithstanding, the great variation of annual precipitation between the years allows agriculture and large trees to grow, surviving recurring drought periods and years like in the summers of 2018 and 2019 with severe drought because of regularly occurring wet periods and years and absence of extremely high temperatures - never reaching . With its vegetation, Halle is far from the steppe or semi-desert vegetation typical of cold semi-arid climates.

==History==

===Name===
Halle&#x27;s early history is connected with the harvesting of salt. The name of the river Saale contains the Germanic root for salt, and salt-harvesting has taken place in Halle since at least the Bronze Age (2300–600 BC).

From 1965 to 1995, the official name was Halle/Saale.

=== Middle Ages until industrialisation ===
The earliest documented mention of Halle dates from AD 806. It became a part of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg in the 10th century and remained so until 1680, when the Margraviate of Brandenburg annexed it together with Magdeburg as the Duchy of Magdeburg, while it was an important location for Martin Luther&#x27;s Reformation in the 16th century. Cardinal Albert of Mainz (Archbishop of Magdeburg from 1513 to 1545) also impacted on the town in this period. According to historic documents, the city of Halle became a member of the Hanseatic League at least as early as 1281.

Halle became a center for Pietism, a movement encouraged by King Frederick William I of Prussia (reigned 1713–1740) because it caused the area&#x27;s large Lutheran population to be more inclined to Fredrick William I&#x27;s religion (Calvinism), as well as more loyal to the Prussian king instead of to the decentralized feudal system. By the 1740s Halle had established many orphanages as well as schools for the wealthy in the sober style Pietism encouraged. This Halle education was the first time the &quot;modern education&quot; system was established. The Halle Pietists also combatted poverty.

During the War of the Fourth Coalition, French and Prussian forces clashed in the Battle of Halle on 17 October 1806. The fighting moved from the covered bridges on the city&#x27;s west side, through the streets and market place, to the eastern suburbs.

In 1815 Halle became part of the Prussian Province of Saxony.

===World War II (1939–1945)===

During World War II, KZ-Außenlager Birkhahn, a subcamp of Buchenwald was in Halle, where prisoners from Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, France, Netherlands and other nations were forced to work in the Siebel aircraft plants, making combat aircraft. The plant was later dismantled. In Ammendorf, a large factory owned by produced mustard gas.

Near the end of World War II, there were two bombing raids carried out against the town: the first on 31 March 1945, the second a few days later. The first attack took place between the railway station and the city&#x27;s centre, and the second bombing was in the southern district. It killed over 1,000 inhabitants and destroyed 3,600 buildings. Among them, are the Market Church, St. George Church, the Old Town Hall, the municipal theatre, historic buildings on Bruederstrasse and on Grosse Steinstrasse, and the city cemetery.

On 17 April 1945, American soldiers occupied Halle, and the Red Tower was set on fire by artillery and destroyed. The Market Church and the Church of St. George received more hits. However, the city was spared further damage because an aerial bombardment was canceled, after former naval officer Felix von Luckner negotiated the city&#x27;s surrender to the American army. In July, the Americans withdrew and the city was occupied by the Red Army.

===German Democratic Republic (1949–1990)===
After World War II, Halle served as the capital of the short-lived administrative region of Saxony-Anhalt until 1952, when the East German government abolished its &quot;Länder&quot; (states). As a part of East Germany (until 1990), it functioned as the capital of the administrative district (&quot;Bezirk&quot;) of Halle.

===Since German unity (after 1990)===
When Saxony-Anhalt was re-established as a in 1990, Magdeburg, not Halle, became the capital.

On 9 October 2019, two people were killed in a shooting incident at a synagogue in Halle. The Federal Prosecutor (Generalbundesanwalt) classified the attack as an act of right-wing terrorism stemming from antisemitism; as a consequence security measures at Jewish facilities were increased.

==Population==

Halle has a population of about 238,000 and is the largest city in Saxony-Anhalt State. In the East Germany era, Halle had a lot of big industry with many workplaces. At the time Halle was one of the leading cities in East Germany, along with Leipzig and Dresden. Halle reached its highest population in 1991 with about 305,000 people. Since German reunification, Halle&#x27;s population began to decline due to its loss of industry, with many people moving to former West Germany. Halle is now considered one of the poorest cities in Germany. Halle&#x27;s foreign population began to grow in 2015 after refugees from Syria and other war torn countries moved to Halle.

==Industrial heritage==
Salt, also known as &quot;white gold&quot;, was extracted from four &quot;Borns&quot; (well-like structures). The four Borns/brine named Gutjahrbrunnen, Meteritzbrunnen, Deutscher Born and Hackeborn, were located around the Hallmarket (or &quot;Under Market&quot;), now a market square with a fountain, just across from the TV station, MDR. The brine was highly concentrated and boiled in &quot;Koten&quot;, simple structured houses made from reed and clay. Salters, who wore a unique uniform with eighteen silver buttons, were known as &quot;Halloren&quot;, and this name was later used for the chocolates in the shape of these buttons.

The Halloren-Werke, the oldest chocolate factory in Germany, was founded in 1804. Old documents are on display and a chocolate room can be visited.

Within East Germany, Halle&#x27;s chemical industry, now mainly shut down, was of great importance. The two main companies in the region were Buna-Werke and Leuna, and Halle-Neustadt was built in the 1960s to accommodate the employees of these two factories.

==Science and culture==
Baroque composer Georg Friedrich Händel (later &quot;George Frideric Handel&quot;) was born in Halle in 1685 and spent the first 17 years of his life in the city. The house where he lived is now a museum about his life. To celebrate his music, Halle has staged a Handel Festival since 1922, annually in June since 1952. The &quot;Franckesche Stiftungen&quot; (Francke Foundations) are home to the &quot;&quot;, which was founded before the year 1116 and is one of the oldest boys&#x27; choirs in the world.

The University of Halle was founded here in 1694. It is now combined with the University of Wittenberg and called the &quot;Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg&quot;. The university&#x27;s medical school was established by Friedrich Hoffmann. Its botanical garden, the Botanische Garten der Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg, dates back to 1698. Halle&#x27;s German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina is the oldest and one of the most respected scientific societies in Germany. Halle is also home to Germany&#x27;s oldest existing Protestant community church library, the Marienbibliothek, founded in 1552, it is the largest of its kind with 36,000 titles. The seat of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, one of the world&#x27;s largest social anthropological research institutions and a part of the Max Planck Society, is in Halle.

Halle was a centre of German Pietism and played an important role in establishing the Lutheran church in North America, when Henry Muhlenberg and others were sent as missionaries to Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century. Muhlenberg is now called the first Patriarch of the Lutheran Church in America. He and his son, Frederick Muhlenberg, who was the first Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, were graduates of Halle University.

The Silver Treasure of the &quot;Halloren&quot; is displayed occasionally at the Technical Museum Saline. It is a unique collection of silver and gold goblets dating back to 1266. The ancient craft of &quot;Schausieden&quot; (boiling of the brine) can be observed there too. The State Museum of Prehistory houses the Nebra sky disk, a significant Bronze-Age find with astronomical significance.

Halle Zoo contributes to the EAZA breeding programme, in particular for the Angolan lion and the Malaysian tiger. Halle is also known for its thriving coypu (or nutria) population, which is native to South America.

With writers such as Heine, Eichendorff, Schleiermacher, Tieck and Novalis the town was a vibrant scene of the German Romanticism. Also Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was a regular guest at the house of his close friend Johann Friedrich Reichardt.

German-American expressionist painter Lyonel Feininger worked in Halle on an invitation by the city from 1929 to 1931. As one of eleven views of the city termed &quot;Halle Cycle&quot;, he painted in 1931 &quot;Die Türme über der Stadt&quot; (The towers above the city), which is now in the Museum Ludwig in Cologne. This painting appeared on a 55 eurocent stamp on 5 December 2002 as a part of the series &quot;Deutsche Malerei des 20. Jahrhunderts&quot; (German painting of the 20th century).

==Transport history==
Ludwig Wucherer made Halle an important rail hub in central Germany. In 1840 he opened the Magdeburg-Halle-Leipzig line, completing a connection between Magdeburg and Dresden. From 1841 to 1860, other lines to Erfurt, Kassel and Berlin followed.

The centrepiece of Halle&#x27;s urban public transport system is the Halle (Saale) tramway network. It includes the world&#x27;s first major electric-powered inner-city tram line, which was opened in 1891. Halle (Saale) Hauptbahnhof is the main railway station.

Halle&#x27;s prominence as a railway centre grew with the arrival of the Erfurt-Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway. Leipzig is also connected to this route, but since it is mostly a terminus station (the Leipzig City Tunnel, opened in 2013, is mostly used by suburban S-Bahn trains and unsuitable for the high-speed network) and the route via Halle is shorter, Halle is used as an intermediate stop by many Berlin-Munich trains.

Leipzig/Halle Airport (opened in 1927) is an international airport located in Schkeuditz, Saxony, and serves both Leipzig, Saxony, and Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. it is Germany&#x27;s 11th largest airport by passengers, handling more than 2.57 million mainly with flights to European leisure destinations. In terms of cargo traffic, the airport is the fifth-busiest in Europe and the second-busiest in Germany after Frankfurt Airport.

==Sports==

The football team &quot;Hallescher FC Wacker 1900&quot; had some regional importance before World War II. In the German Championship &quot;Wacker&quot; reached the semi-finals in 1921, and the quarter-finals in 1928. The successor team became East German champions in 1949 and 1952 under the names of &quot;ZSG Union&quot; and &quot;BSG Turbine Halle&quot;. From these evolved today&#x27;s &quot;Turbine Halle&quot; and &quot;Hallescher FC&quot;. In the era of the German Democratic Republic, the latter club (as &quot;Chemie Halle&quot; ) was a mainstay in the first division and won the Cup tournament in 1956 and 1962. The most prominent player was 72-times international Bernd Bransch, who was with &quot;Chemie&quot; in the 1960s and 1970s. These days, &quot;Hallescher FC&quot; usually plays in the third division.

The general sports club &quot;&quot;, originating from &quot;Chemie Halle&quot;, created a notable number of Olympic gold medallists and world champions, mainly in nautical and watersports, e.g., swimmer Kornelia Ender won four Olympic gold medals in 1976 and Andreas Hajek won four rowing world championships between 1998 and 2001. The basketball team of the club – these days known as &quot;Lions&quot; and focusing on the woman&#x27;s team which plays in the national first division – won five men&#x27;s and 10 women&#x27;s championships of the German Democratic Republic.
The Hallescher FC&#x27;s location is extremely close to a train station.

<text>The spolia opima (Latin for &#x27;rich spoils&#x27;) were the armour, arms, and other effects that an ancient Roman general stripped from the body of an opposing commander slain in single combat. The spolia opima were regarded as the most honourable of the several types of war trophies a commander could obtain, including enemy military standards and the peaks of warships.

==Royal and Republican periods==
For the majority of the city&#x27;s existence, the Romans recognized only three instances when spolia opima were taken. The precedent was imagined in Rome&#x27;s mythical history, which tells that in 752 BC Romulus defeated and stripped Acron, king of the Caeninenses, following the Rape of the Sabine Women. In the second instance, Aulus Cornelius Cossus obtained the spolia opima from Lars Tolumnius, king of the Veientes, during Rome&#x27;s semi-legendary fifth century BC. 

The third and most historically grounded occurred before the Second Punic War, when Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 222 BC) galloped forward beyond his battle line and speared the Celtic warrior Viridomarus, a king of the Gaesatae, before stripping him of his armour on the battlefield.

The ceremony of the spolia opima was a ritual of state religion that was supposed to emulate the archaic ceremonies carried out by the founder Romulus. The victor affixed the stripped armor to the trunk of an oak tree, carried it himself in a procession to the Capitoline, and dedicated it at the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius.

To dedicate the spoils to Jupiter Feretrius, one needed be the commander of a Roman army. Thus, Titus Manlius Torquatus, Valerius Corvus and Scipio Aemilianus, though they all slew enemy leaders in single combat (the first two against Gauls and Aemilianus against a king in Hispania), were not considered to have won the spolia opima.

==Imperial period==
During the early years of the imperial regime, in 27 BC, M Licinius Crassus (grandson of the triumvir) after victories in Macedonia requested a triumph and right to dedicate spolia opima due to his slaying of an enemy chieftain in hand-to-hand combat. Dedication rights were denied by Augustus. Crassus&#x27; illustrious political lineage made him a potential rival to Augustus. While Crassus&#x27; triumph was granted, it was required to be a joint triumph with Augustus who may have argued he deserved it due to his also holding &quot;imperium&quot; in Macedonia.

Nero Claudius Drusus, a Roman general of the first century BC and member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, sought out Germanic chieftains to face in single combat during his campaigns. Sources suggest that he eventually may have been able to take the spolia opima.

<text>The Douglas DC-8 (sometimes McDonnell Douglas DC-8) is an early long-range narrow-body jetliner designed and produced by the American Douglas Aircraft Company. Work began in 1952 towards the United States Air Force&#x27;s (USAF) requirement for a jet-powered aerial refueling tanker. After losing the USAF&#x27;s tanker competition to the rival Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker in May 1954, Douglas announced in June 1955 its derived jetliner project marketed to civil operators. In October 1955, Pan Am made the first order along with the competing Boeing 707, and many other airlines soon followed. The first DC-8 was rolled out in Long Beach Airport on April 9, 1958, and flew for the first time on May 30. Following Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification in August 1959, the DC-8 entered service with Delta Air Lines on September 18.
Permitting six-abreast seating, the four-engined, low-wing jet aircraft was initially produced in four long variants. The DC-8-10 was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojets, and had a MTOW; the DC-8-20 had more powerful JT4A turbojets, for a MTOW. The models had more fuel capacity, and had an MTOW of up to ; it was powered by JT4As for the Series 30, and by Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans for the Series 40. The Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D powered the later DC-8-50 and Super 60 (DC-8-61, -62, and -63) as well as freighter versions, and reached a MTOW of . A stretched DC-8 variant was not initially considered, leading some airlines to order the competing Boeing 707 instead.
The improved Series 60 was announced in April 1965.
The DC-8-61 was stretched by for 180–220 seats in mixed-class and a MTOW of . It first flew on March 14, 1966, was certified on September 2, 1966, and entered service with United Airlines in February 1967. The long-range DC-8-62 followed in April 1967, stretched by , could seat up to 189 passengers over with a larger wing for a MTOW up to . The DC-8-63 had the long fuselage and the enlarged wing, freighters MTOW reached .
The DC-8 was produced until 1972 with 556 aircraft built; it was superseded by larger wide-body airliners including Douglas&#x27; DC-10 trijet.
Noise concerns stimulated demand for a quieter variant; from 1975, Douglas and General Electric offered the Series 70 retrofit, powered by the quieter and more fuel-efficient CFM56 turbofan engine. It largely exited passenger service during the 1980s and 1990s, but some re-engined DC-8s remain in use as freighters.

== Development ==

=== Background ===
At the end of World War II, Douglas was a dominant North American aircraft producer in the commercial aviation market, only being rivaled by Boeing, releasing the innovative all-metal Model 247 airliner in 1933, and produced prodigious quantities of the rugged four-engined B-17 Flying Fortress and sophisticated, pressurized long-range B-29 Superfortress. Douglas produced a succession of piston-engined aircraft (DC-2, DC-3, DC-4, DC-5, DC-6, and DC-7) through the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. While de Havilland flew the world&#x27;s first jet airliner, the Comet, in May 1949, Douglas initially refrained from developing a jet airliner.

De Havilland&#x27;s pioneering Comet entered airline service in May 1952. Initially, it appeared to be a success, but the Comet was grounded in 1954 after two fatal accidents which were subsequently attributed to rapid metal fatigue failure of the pressure cabin. Various aircraft manufacturers benefited from the findings and experiences gained from the investigation into Comet losses; specifically, Douglas paid significant attention to detail in the design of the DC-8&#x27;s pressurized cabin. By 1952, Douglas had continued its success as a commercial aircraft manufacturer, having received almost 300 orders for its piston-engine DC-6 and its successor, the DC-7, which had yet to fly. The Comet disasters, and the airlines&#x27; subsequent lack of interest in jets, seemed to validate the company&#x27;s decision to remain with propeller-driven aircraft, but its inaction enabled rival manufacturers to take the lead instead.

As early as 1949, rival company Boeing had started design work on a pure jet airliner. Boeing&#x27;s military arm had experience with large long-range jets, such as the B-47 Stratojet and the B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombers. While producing and supporting these bombers for the United States Air Force (USAF), Boeing had developed a close relationship with the USAF&#x27;s Strategic Air Command (SAC). The company also supplied the SAC&#x27;s refueling aircraft, the piston-engined KC-97 Stratofreighters, but these proved to be too slow and low flying to easily work with the new jet bombers. The B-52, in particular, had to descend from its cruising altitude and then slow almost to its stall speed to refuel from the KC-97. Believing that a requirement for a jet-powered tanker was a certainty, Boeing started work on a new jet aircraft for this role that could be adapted into an airliner. As an airliner, it would have similar seating capacity to the Comet, but the use of a swept wing enabled a higher cruising speed and better range. First presented in 1950 as the &quot;Model 473-60C&quot;, Boeing failed to generate any interest from airlines, yet remained confident that the project was worthwhile and pressed ahead with a prototype, the Boeing 367-80 (&quot;Dash-80&quot;). After spending $16 million of its own money to build it, the Dash-80 rolled out on May 15, 1954.

=== Early design phase ===
During mid-1952, Douglas opted to covertly begin work on definition studies for a jet-powered transport aircraft. The company&#x27;s design team examined various arrangements, including some that closely resembled the Comet. By mid-1953, the team had settled on a form similar to the final DC-8; an 80-seat, low-wing aircraft powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C turbojet engines, 30° wing sweep, and an internal cabin diameter of to allow five-abreast seating. The use of podded engines was seen as highly beneficial for maintenance purposes as well as to increase wing volume for accommodating fuel. The fuselage featured a double-bubble cross-section that produced relatively low drag while providing for a relatively spacious passenger cabin along with a large cargo deck that was sufficiently tall as to permit ground crews to stand up within it.

While Douglas remained lukewarm about the jet airliner project, it believed that the USAF tanker contract would go to two companies for two different aircraft, as several USAF transport contracts in the past had done. In May 1954, the USAF circulated its requirement for 800 jet tankers to Boeing, Douglas, Convair, Fairchild Aircraft, Lockheed Corporation, and Martin Marietta. At the time, Boeing was only two months away from having its prototype in the air. Just four months after issuing the tanker requirement, the USAF ordered the first 29 KC-135 Stratotankers from Boeing. Donald Douglas was reportedly shocked by the rapidity of the decision which, he claimed, had been made before the competing companies even had time to complete their bids. He protested to Washington, but without success.
Having already started on the DC-8 project, Douglas decided that the best option was to press on than abandon the project. Following consultations with the airlines, several design changes were made, such as the fuselage being widened by to permit six-abreast seating, which in turn led to larger wings and tail surfaces being adopted along with a lengthening of the fuselage. The existence of the DC-8 was formally announced on 7 June 1955; at the time of the announcement, the development costs had been forecast to be roughly $450 million. Four versions were offered to begin with, all with the same long airframe with a wingspan, but varying in engines and fuel capacity, and with maximum weights of about 240,000–260,000 lb (109–118 metric tons). Douglas steadfastly refused to offer different fuselage sizes. The maiden flight was planned for December 1957, with entry into revenue service in 1959. Aware that the program was lagging behind Boeing, Douglas began a major marketing push to promote its new jetliner.

=== First orders ===
Douglas&#x27; previous thinking about the airliner market seemed to be coming true; the transition to turbine power looked likely to be to turboprops rather than turbojets. The pioneering 40–60-seat Vickers Viscount was in service and proving popular with passengers and airlines: it was faster, quieter, and more comfortable than piston-engined types. Another British rival was the 90-seat Bristol Britannia, and Douglas&#x27;s main rival in the large airliner market, Lockheed Corporation, had committed to the short to medium range 80–100-seat turboprop Electra, with a launch order from American Airlines for 35 and other orders flowing in. Meanwhile, the Comet remained grounded, the French 90-passenger twin jet Sud Aviation Caravelle prototype had just flown for the first time, and the Boeing 707 was not expected to be available until late 1958. The major airlines were reluctant to commit themselves to the huge financial and technical challenges of jet aircraft; however, none could afford &quot;not&quot; to buy jets if their competitors did.

There the matter rested until October 1955, when Pan American World Airways placed simultaneous orders with Boeing for 20 707s and Douglas for 25 DC-8s. To buy one expensive and untried jet-powered aircraft type was brave: to buy both was, at the time, unheard of. In the closing months of 1955, other airlines rushed to follow suit: Air France, American Airlines, Braniff International Airways, Continental Airlines, and Sabena ordered 707s; United Airlines, National Airlines, KLM, Eastern Air Lines, Japan Air Lines, and Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) chose the DC-8. In 1956, Air India, BOAC, Lufthansa, Qantas, and TWA added over 50 to the 707 order book, while Douglas sold 22 DC-8s to Delta, Swissair, TAI, Trans Canada, and UAT. By the start of 1958, Douglas had sold 133 DC-8s compared to Boeing&#x27;s 150 707s.

=== Production and testing ===
Donald Douglas proposed to build and test the DC-8 at Santa Monica Airport, which had been the birthplace of the DC-3 and home to a Douglas plant that employed 44,000 workers during World War II. To accommodate the new jet, Douglas asked the city of Santa Monica, California to lengthen the airport&#x27;s runway. Following complaints by neighboring residents, the city refused, so Douglas moved its airliner production line to Long Beach Airport. In September 1956, production of the first prototype commenced. The first DC-8 &quot;N8008D&quot; was rolled out of the new Long Beach factory on 9 April 1958 and flew for the first time, in Series 10 form, on 30 May for two hours and seven minutes with the crew being led by A.G. Heimerdinger.

Later that year, an enlarged version of the Comet finally returned to service, but had arrived too late to secure a substantial portion of the market: de Havilland secured just 25 orders. In August, Boeing had begun delivering 707s to Pan Am. Douglas made a massive effort to close the gap with Boeing, using no fewer than ten aircraft for flight testing to achieve Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification for the first of the many DC-8 variants in August 1959. Several modifications proved to be necessary: the original air brakes on the lower rear fuselage were found to be ineffective and were deleted as engine thrust reversers had become available; unique leading-edge slots were added to improve low-speed lift; the prototype was 25 kn (46 km/h) short of its promised cruising speed and a new, slightly larger wingtip had to be developed to reduce drag. Also, a recontoured wing leading edge was later developed to extend the chord 4% and reduce drag at high Mach numbers.

On August 21, 1961, a DC-8 broke the sound barrier at Mach 1.012 (660 mph/1,062 km/h) while in a controlled dive through and maintained that speed for 16 seconds. The flight was to collect data on a new leading edge design for the wing, and, while doing so, the DC-8 became the first civilian jet – and the first jet airliner – to make a supersonic flight. The aircraft was DC-8-43 registered as &quot;CF-CPG&quot;, later delivered to Canadian Pacific Air Lines. The aircraft, crewed by Captain William Magruder, First Officer Paul Patten, Flight Engineer Joseph Tomich and Flight Test Engineer Richard Edwards, took off from Edwards Air Force Base in California and was accompanied to altitude by a F-104 Starfighter supersonic chase aircraft flown by Chuck Yeager.

=== Entry into service ===
On September 18, 1959, the DC-8 entered service with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. According to the Delta Air Lines website, the air carrier was the first to operate the DC-8 in scheduled passenger service. By March 1960, Douglas had reached its planned production rate of eight DC-8s per month. Despite a large number of DC-8 early models being available, all used the same basic airframe, differing only in engines, weights and details; in contrast, the rival Boeing 707 range offered several fuselage lengths and two wingspans: the original 707-120, a version that sacrificed space to gain longer range, and the stretched 707-320, which at overall had more cabin space than the DC-8.

Douglas&#x27; refusal to offer different fuselage sizes made it less adaptable and compelled airlines such as Delta and United to look elsewhere for short to medium range types. Delta ordered Convair 880s while United chose the newly developed short-fuselage 707-020. United prevailed on Boeing to rename the new variant the Boeing 720 in case the public thought they were dissatisfied with the DC-8. Pan Am never reordered the DC-8 and Douglas gradually lost market share to Boeing. In 1962, DC-8 sales dropped to just 26 aircraft that year, followed by 21 in 1963 and 14 in 1964; many of these later deliveries were of the Jet Trader model rather than the more-prestigious passenger versions. In 1967, Douglas merged with McDonnell Aircraft, becoming McDonnell Douglas.

=== Further developments ===
During the early 1960s, Douglas began considering stretching the DC-8, a feat that was eased by its fuselage keeping the same dimensions across its length. In April 1965, the company announced belated fuselage stretches for the DC-8 with three new models known as the &quot;Super Sixties&quot;. The DC-8 program had been in danger of closing with fewer than 300 aircraft sold, but the Super Sixties brought fresh life to it. By the time production of the DC-8 ceased in 1972, 262 of the Super Sixties had been completed, almost half of all models produced. With the ability to seat 269 passengers, the DC-8 Series 61 and 63 had the largest passenger-carrying capacity available. That remained so until the Boeing 747 arrived in 1970. The DC-8-62 featured a shorter fuselage when compared with the Series 61 and 63, but was capable of nonstop long-range operations.

All of the earlier jetliners were relatively noisy by modern standards. Increasing traffic densities and changing public attitudes led to complaints about aircraft noise and moves to introduce restrictions. As early as 1966 the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey expressed concern about the noise to be expected from the then still-unbuilt DC-8-61, and operators had to agree to operate it from New York at lower weights to reduce noise. By the early 1970s, legislation for aircraft noise standards was being introduced in many countries, and the 60 Series DC-8s were particularly at risk of being banned from major airports.
In the early 1970s, several airlines approached McDonnell Douglas with requests for noise reduction modifications to their DC-8s. While third parties had developed aftermarket hushkits, there was initially no meaningful action taken by Douglas to fulfil these requests and effectively enable the DC-8 to remain in service. Finally, in 1975, General Electric began discussions with major airlines to fit the new and vastly-quieter Franco-American CFM56 engine to both DC-8s and 707s. MDC remained reluctant but eventually came on board in the late 1970s and helped develop the Series 70. The Super Seventies proved to be a great success, being roughly 70% quieter than the 60 Series and, at the time of their introduction, the world&#x27;s quietest four-engined airliner. As well as being quieter and more powerful, the CFM56 was up to 23% more fuel-efficient than the JT3D, which reduced operating costs and extended the range. The largest single customer for the Series 70 was United, converting 29 of its Series 61 airliners at a reported cost of $400 million.

By 2002, of the 1,032 Boeing 707s and 720s manufactured for commercial use, just 80 remained in service – though many of those 707s were converted for USAF use, either in service or for spare parts. Of the 556 DC-8s made, around 200 were still in commercial service in 2002, including about 25 50-Series, 82 of the stretched 60-Series, and 96 out of the 110 re-engined 70-Series. Most of the surviving DC-8s are now used as freighters. In May 2009, 97 DC-8s were in service following UPS&#x27;s decision to retire its remaining fleet of 44. In January 2013, an estimated 36 DC-8s were in use worldwide. As a result of aging, increasing operating costs and strict noise and emissions regulations, the number of active DC-8s continues to decline, with the youngest airframes having exceeded 50 years of age in 2022.

== Variants ==

=== Series 10 ===
For domestic use, powered by 13,500 lb (60.5 kN) Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3C-6 turbojets with water injection. First Series 10 DC-8 flew on 30 May 1958. The initial DC-8-11 model had the original wingtips used on the prototype, and all remaining DC-8 Series 10 aircraft were upgraded to DC-8-12 standard. The DC-8-12 featured new low-drag wingtips and leading-edge slots, 80 inches long between the engines on each wing and 34 inches long inboard of the inner engines. These unique devices were covered by doors on the upper and lower wing surfaces that opened for low-speed flight and closed for cruise. The maximum weight increased from . This model was originally named &quot;DC-8A&quot; until the series 30 was introduced. 30 DC-8-10s were built: 23 for United and six for Delta, plus the prototype. By the mid-sixties, United had converted 16 of its 21 surviving aircraft to DC-8-20 standard and the other five to -50s. Delta converted its six to DC-8-50s. The prototype was itself also converted to a DC-8-50.

It received FAA certification on 31 August 1958, entering service with United Airlines and Delta Air Lines on 18 September 1959.

=== Series 20 ===
Higher-powered 15,800 lb (70.8 kN) thrust Pratt &amp; Whitney JT4A-3 turbojets (without water injection) allowed a weight increase to . 33 DC-8-20s were built plus 16 converted DC-8-10s. This model was originally named &quot;DC-8B&quot; but was renamed when the Series 30 was introduced.

The first Series 20 DC-8 flew on 29 November 1958 and received FAA certification on 19 January 1960.

=== Series 30 ===

For intercontinental routes, the three Series 30 variants combined JT4A engines with a one-third increase in fuel capacity and strengthened fuselage and landing gear. The DC-8-31 was certified in March 1960 with 16,800 lb (75.2 kN) JT4A-9 engines for maximum takeoff weight. The DC-8-32 was similar but allowed weight. The DC-8-33 of November 1960 substituted 17,500 lb (78.4 kN) JT4A-11 turbojets, a modification to the flap linkage to allow a 1.5° setting for more efficient cruise, stronger landing gear, and maximum weight. Many -31 and -32 DC-8s were upgraded to this standard. A total of 57 DC-8-30s were produced (five of which were later upgraded to DC-8-50 standard).

The Series 30 DC-8 first flew on 21 February 1959 and received FAA certification on 1 February 1960.

=== Series 40 ===
The DC-8-40 was essentially the -30 but with 17,500 lb (78.4 kN) Rolls-Royce Conway 509 turbofan engines for better efficiency, less noise and less smoke. The Conway was an improvement over the turbojets that preceded it, but the Series 40 sold poorly because of the traditional reluctance of U.S. airlines to buy a foreign product and because the still-more-advanced Pratt &amp; Whitney JT3D turbofan was due in early 1961. The DC-8-41 and DC-8-42 had weights of respectively, the DC-8-43 had the 1.5° flap setting of the -33 and introduced a 4% leading-edge wing extension to reduce drag and increase fuel capacity slightly – the new wing improved range by 8%, lifting capacity by 6,600 lb (3 metric tons), and cruising speed by better than . It was used on all later DC-8s. The first DC-8-40 was delivered in 1960; 32 were built (of which three would eventually be converted to DC-8-50s).

The Series 40 DC-8 first flew on 23 July 1959 and received FAA certification on 24 March 1960.

=== Series 50 ===

The definitive short-fuselage DC-8 came with the same engine that powered the vast majority of 707s, the JT3D. Twenty earlier DC-8s were converted to this standard. All but the -55 were certified in 1961. The DC-8-51, DC-8-52 and DC-8-53 all had 17,000 lb (76.1 kN) JT3D-1 or 18,000 lb (80.6 kN) JT3D-3B engines, varying mainly in their weights: , and respectively. The DC-8-55 arrived in June 1964, retaining the JT3D-3B engines but with strengthened structure from the freighter versions and maximum weight. 142 DC-8-50s were built plus the 20 converted from Series 10/30/40.

The Series 50 first flew on 20 December 1960 and received FAA certification on 1 May 1961.

* DC-8 Jet Trader: Douglas approved the development of freighter versions of the DC-8 in May 1961, based on the Series 50. An original plan to fit a fixed bulkhead separating the forward of the cabin for freight, leaving the rear cabin for 54 passenger seats was soon replaced by a more practical one to use a movable bulkhead and allow anywhere between 25 and 114 seats with the remainder set aside for cargo. A large cargo door was fitted into the forward fuselage, the cabin floor was reinforced and the rear pressure bulkhead was moved by nearly to make more space. Airlines could order a windowless cabin but only United did, ordering 15 in 1964. The DC-8F-54 had a maximum takeoff weight of and the DC-8F-55 . Both used 18,000 lb (80.6 kN) JT3D-3B powerplants. 62 aircraft built (plus one converted from a standard DC-8-50 and two of the three converted DC-8-40s).
* EC-24A: A single former United Airlines DC-8-54 (F) was used by the United States Navy as an electronic warfare training platform. It was retired in October 1998 and is now in storage with the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group.

=== Super 60 Series ===

* DC-8 Series 61: The &quot;Super DC-8&quot; Series 61 was designed for high capacity and medium range. It had the same wings, engines and pylons as the -55, and sacrificed range to gain capacity. Having decided to stretch the DC-8, Douglas inserted a plug in the forward fuselage and a plug aft, taking overall length to . The added length required strengthening of the structure, but the basic DC-8 design already had sufficient ground clearance to permit the one-third increase in cabin size without requiring longer landing gear. The variant first flew on March 14, 1966, and was certified on September 2, 1966, at a maximum weight of . Deliveries began in January 1967 and it entered service with United Airlines in February 1967. It typically carried 180–220 passengers in mixed-class configuration, or 259 in high-density configuration. A cargo door equipped DC-8-61CF was also available. 78 -61s and 10 -61CFs were built.
* DC-8 Series 62: The long-range Series 62 followed in April 1967. It had a more modest stretch, two plugs fore and aft of the wing taking overall length to , and a number of modifications to provide greater range. wingtip extensions reduced drag and added fuel capacity, and Douglas redesigned the engine pods, extending the pylons and substituting new shorter and neater nacelles, all in the cause of drag reduction. The 18,000 lb JT3D-3B was retained but the engine pylons were redesigned to eliminate their protrusion above the wing and make them sweep forward more sharply, so that the engines were some further forward. The engine pods were also modified with a reduction in diameter and the elimination of the and bypass duct. The changes all improved the aircraft&#x27;s aerodynamic efficiency. The DC-8 Series 62 is slightly heavier than the or at , and is able to seat up to 189 passengers. The had a range with full payload of about ; roughly the same as the , but with 40 extra passengers. Many late production had maximum takeoff weight and were known as the . Also available were the cargo door-equipped convertible or all cargo . Production included 51 DC-8-62s, 10 , and 6 .
* DC-8 Series 63: The &quot;Super DC-8&quot; Series 63 was the final new-build variant and entered service in June 1968. It had the long fuselage of the , the aerodynamic refinements and increased fuel capacity of the and 19,000 lb (85.1 kN) JT3D-7 engines. This allowed a maximum takeoff weight of . Like the , the Series 63 was also available as a cargo door equipped or all cargo . The freighters had a further increase in Maximum Take Off Weight to . Eastern Air Lines bought six which incorporated the strengthened floor of the freighters but lacked the main deck cargo door. Production included 41 DC-8-63s, 53 , 7 , and 6 . The Flying Tiger Line was a major early customer for the DC-8-63F.

=== Super 70 Series ===
The DC-8-71, DC-8-72, and DC-8-73 were straightforward conversions of the -61, -62 and -63 primarily involving the replacement of the JT3D engines with the more fuel-efficient CFM International CFM56-2, a high bypass turbofan, which produced 22,000 lbf (98.5 kN) of thrust. The conversions also includes new nacelles and pylons built by Grumman Aerospace. Maximum takeoff weights remained the same, but there was a slight reduction in payload because of the heavier engines. Modifications to create the -71 was more involved because the -61 did not have the improved wings and relocated engines of the -62 and -63.

All three models were certified in 1982 and a total of 110 60-series Super DC-8s were converted by the time the program ended in 1988. DC-8 series 70 conversions were overseen by Cammacorp with CFMI, McDonnell Douglas, and Grumman Aerospace as partners. Cammacorp was disbanded after the last aircraft was converted.

== Operators ==
, two DC-8s are in commercial service with Congolese cargo airline Trans Air Cargo. These are DC-8-62s (9S-AJG and 9S-AJO).

In the U.S, the DC-8 has been retired from commercial service entirely; only one example maintains active registration (with one flying). Samaritan&#x27;s Purse (a religious humanitarian relief organization) has operated a DC-8-72 Combi (acquired from Air Transport International) since 2015.

In 2024, NASA retired N817NA, a DC-8-72 flying laboratory that has supported research in meteorology, oceanography, geography, and various other scientific disciplines since 1986. NASA is to replace the DC-8 with a more capable and fuel-efficient Boeing 777-200ER. The DC-8 was donated to Idaho State University and is preserved at Pocatello Regional Airport.

== Accidents and incidents ==
, the DC-8 had been involved in 146 incidents, including 84 hull-loss accidents, with 2,255 fatalities. The DC-8 has also been involved in 46 hijackings with 2 fatalities. The deadliest incident involving the DC-8 was Nigeria Airways Flight 2120 which crashed on July 11, 1991, with 261 fatalities.

<doc id="186224" wikidata="Q148285" url="?curid=186224" title="Rajneesh">
<text>Rajneesh (born Chandra Mohan Jain; 11 December 193119 January 1990), also known as Acharya Rajneesh, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, and later as Osho (), was an Indian godman, philosopher, mystic and founder of the Rajneesh movement. He was viewed as a controversial new religious movement leader during his life. He rejected institutional religions, insisting that spiritual experience could not be organized into any one system of religious dogma. As a guru, he advocated meditation and taught a unique form called dynamic meditation. Rejecting traditional ascetic practices, he advocated that his followers live fully in the world but without attachment to it.

Rajneesh experienced a spiritual awakening in 1953 at the age of 21. Following several years in academia, in 1966 Rajneesh resigned his post at the University of Jabalpur and began traveling throughout India, becoming known as a vocal critic of the orthodoxy of mainstream religions, as well as of mainstream political ideologies and of Mahatma Gandhi. In 1970, Rajneesh spent time in Mumbai initiating followers known as &quot;neo-sannyasins&quot;. During this period, he expanded his spiritual teachings and commented extensively in discourses on the writings of religious traditions, mystics, bhakti poets, and philosophers from around the world. In 1974, Rajneesh relocated to Pune, where an ashram was established and a variety of therapies, incorporating methods first developed by the Human Potential Movement, were offered to a growing Western following. By the late 1970s, the tension between the ruling Janata Party government of Morarji Desai and the movement led to a curbing of the ashram&#x27;s development and a back tax claim estimated at $5 million.

In 1981, the Rajneesh movement&#x27;s efforts refocused on activities in the United States and Rajneesh relocated to a facility known as Rajneeshpuram in Wasco County, Oregon. The movement ran into conflict with county residents and the state government, and a succession of legal battles concerning the ashram&#x27;s construction and continued development curtailed its success. In 1985, Rajneesh publicly asked local authorities to investigate his personal secretary Ma Anand Sheela and her close supporters for a number of crimes, including a 1984 mass food-poisoning attack intended to influence county elections, an aborted assassination plot on U.S. attorney Charles H. Turner, the attempted murder of Rajneesh&#x27;s personal physician, and the bugging of his own living quarters; authorities later convicted several members of the ashram, including Sheela. That year, Rajneesh was deported from the United States on separate immigration-related charges in accordance with an &quot;Alford&quot; plea. After his deportation, 21 countries denied him entry. 

Rajneesh ultimately returned to Mumbai, India, in 1986. After staying in the house of a disciple where he resumed his discourses for six months, he returned to Pune in January 1987 and revived his ashram, where he died in 1990. Rajneesh&#x27;s ashram, now known as OSHO International Meditation Resort, and all associated intellectual property, is managed by the registered Osho International Foundation (formerly Rajneesh International Foundation). Rajneesh&#x27;s teachings have had an impact on Western New Age thought, and their popularity reportedly increased between the time of his death and 2005.

== Life ==

===Childhood and adolescence: 1931–1950===
Rajneesh (a childhood nickname from the Sanskrit , , &quot;night&quot;, and , , &quot;lord&quot;) was born Chandra Mohan Jain, the eldest of 11 children of a cloth merchant, at his maternal grandparents&#x27; house in Kuchwada; a small village in the Raisen District of Madhya Pradesh state in India. His parents, Babulal and Saraswati Jain, who were Taranpanthi Jains, let him live with his maternal grandparents until he was eight years old. By Rajneesh&#x27;s own account, this was a major influence on his development because his grandmother gave him the utmost freedom, leaving him carefree without an imposed education or restrictions.

When he was seven years old, his grandfather died, and he went to Gadarwara to live with his parents. Rajneesh was profoundly affected by his grandfather&#x27;s death, and again by the death of his childhood girlfriend Shashi from typhoid when he was 15, leading to a preoccupation with death that lasted throughout much of his childhood and youth. In his school years, he was a gifted and rebellious student, and gained a reputation as a formidable debater. Rajneesh became critical of traditional religion, took an interest in many methods to expand consciousness, including breath control, yogic exercises, meditation, fasting, the occult, and hypnosis. According to Vasant Joshi, Rajneesh read widely from an early age; although he played sports as a young boy, reading was his primary interest. After showing an interest in the writings of Marx and Engels, he was branded a communist and was threatened with expulsion from school. According to Joshi, with the help of friends, he built a small library containing mostly communist literature. Rajneesh, according to his uncle Amritlal, also formed a group of young people that regularly discussed communist ideology and their opposition to religion.

Rajneesh was later to say, &quot;I have been interested in communism from my very childhood...communist literature — perhaps there is no book that is missing from my library. I have signed and dated each book before 1950. Small details are so vivid before me, because that was my first entry into the intellectual world. First I was deeply interested in communism, but finding that it is a corpse I became interested in anarchism — that was also a Russian phenomenon — Prince Kropotkin, Bakunin, Leo Tolstoy. All three were anarchists: no state, no government in the world.&quot;

He became briefly associated with socialism and two Indian nationalist organisations: the Indian National Army and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. However, his membership in the organisations was short-lived as he could not submit to any external discipline, ideology, or system.

=== University years and public speaker: 1951–1970 ===
In 1951, aged 19, Rajneesh began his studies at Hitkarini College in Jabalpur. Asked to leave after conflicts with an instructor, he transferred to D. N. Jain College, also in Jabalpur. Having proved himself to be disruptively argumentative, he was not required to attend college classes at D. N. Jain College except for examinations and used his free time to work for a few months as an assistant editor at a local newspaper. He began speaking in public at the annual &quot;Sarva Dharma Sammelan&quot; (Meeting of all faiths) held at Jabalpur, organised by the Taranpanthi Jain community into which he was born, and participated there from 1951 to 1968. He resisted his parents&#x27; pressure to marry. Rajneesh later said, he became spiritually enlightened on 21 March 1953, when he was 21 years old, in a mystical experience while sitting under a tree in the Bhanvartal garden in Jabalpur.

Having completed his BA in philosophy at D. N. Jain College in 1955, he joined the University of Sagar, where in 1957, he earned his MA in philosophy (with distinction). He immediately secured a teaching position at Raipur Sanskrit College, but the vice-chancellor soon asked him to seek a transfer as he considered him a danger to his students&#x27; morality, character, and religion. From 1958, he taught philosophy as a lecturer at Jabalpur University, being promoted to professor in 1960. A popular lecturer, he was acknowledged by his peers as an exceptionally intelligent man who had been able to overcome the deficiencies of his early small-town education.

In parallel to his university job, he travelled throughout India under the name Acharya Rajneesh (&quot;Acharya&quot; means teacher or professor; Rajneesh was a nickname he had acquired in childhood), giving lectures critical of socialism, Gandhi, and institutional religions. He travelled so much that he would find it difficult to sleep on a normal bed, because he had grown used to sleeping amid the rocking of railway coach berths.

According to a speech given by Rajneesh in 1969, socialism is the ultimate result of capitalism, and capitalism itself, of revolution that brings about socialism. Rajneesh stated that he believed that in India, socialism was inevitable, but fifty, sixty or seventy years hence, India should apply its efforts to first creating wealth. He said that socialism would socialise only poverty, and he described Gandhi as a masochist reactionary who worshipped poverty. What India needed to escape its backwardness was capitalism, science, modern technology, and birth control. He did not regard capitalism and socialism as opposite systems, but considered it disastrous for any country to talk about socialism without first building a capitalist economy. He criticised orthodox Indian religions as dead, filled with empty rituals, oppressing their followers with fears of damnation and promises of blessings. Such statements made him controversial, but also gained him a loyal following that included a number of wealthy merchants and businessmen. These people sought individual consultations from him about their spiritual development and transforming their daily lives, in return for donations and his practice snowballed. From 1962, he began to lead 3- to 10-day meditation camps, and the first meditation centres (Jivan Jagruti Kendra) started to emerge around his teaching, then known as the Life Awakening Movement (Jivan Jagruti Andolan). After a controversial speaking tour in 1966, he resigned from his teaching post at the request of the university.

In a 1968 lecture series, later published under the title &quot;From Sex to Superconsciousness&quot;, he scandalised Hindu leaders by calling for freer acceptance of sex and became known as the &quot;sex guru&quot; in the Indian press. When in 1969, he was invited to speak at the Second World Hindu Conference, despite the misgivings of some Hindu leaders, his statements raised controversy again when he said, &quot;Any religion which considers life meaningless and full of misery and teaches the hatred of life, is not a true religion. Religion is an art that shows how to enjoy life.&quot; He compared the treatment of lower caste shudras and women with the treatment of animals. He characterised brahmin as being motivated by self-interest, provoking the &quot;Shankaracharya&quot; of Puri, who tried in vain to have his lecture stopped.

=== Mumbai: 1971–1974 ===

At a public meditation event in early 1970, Rajneesh presented his Dynamic Meditation method for the first time. Dynamic Meditation involved breathing very fast and celebrating with music and dance. He left Jabalpur for Mumbai at the end of June. On 26 September 1970, he initiated his first group of disciples or neo-sannyasins. Becoming a disciple apparently meant assuming a new name and wearing the traditional saffron dress of ascetic Hindu holy men, including a &quot;mala&quot; (beaded necklace) carrying a locket with his picture. However, his sannyasins were encouraged to follow a celebratory rather than ascetic lifestyle. He himself was not to be worshipped but regarded as a catalytic agent, &quot;a sun encouraging the flower to open&quot;.

He had by then, acquired a secretary, Laxmi Thakarsi Kuruwa, who as his first disciple had taken the name Ma Yoga Laxmi. Laxmi was the daughter of one of his early followers, a wealthy Jain, who had been a key supporter of the Indian National Congress during the struggle for Indian independence, with close ties to Gandhi, Nehru, and Morarji Desai. She raised the money that enabled Rajneesh to stop his travels and settle down. In December 1970, he moved to the Woodlands Apartments in Mumbai, where he gave lectures and received visitors, among them his first Western visitors. He now traveled rarely, no longer speaking at open public meetings. In 1971, he adopted the title &quot;Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh&quot;.

Speaking about the name change from Acharya to Bhagwan, Rajneesh said in later years, &quot;I loved the term. I said, &#x27;At least for a few years that will do. Then we can drop it.&#x27;&quot;

Rajneesh also added, “I have chosen it for a specific purpose and it has been serving well, because people who used to come to gather knowledge, they stopped. The day I called myself Bhagwan, they stopped. It was too much for them, it was too much for their egos, someone calling himself Bhagwan...It hurts the ego. Now I&#x27;ve changed my function absolutely. I started working on a different level, in a different dimension. Now I give you being, not knowledge. I was an acharya and they were students; they were learning. Now I am no more a teacher and you are not here as students. I am here to impart being. I am here to make you awaken. I am not here to give knowledge, I am going to give you knowing- and that is a totally different dimension.”Calling myself Bhagwan was simply symbolic – that now I have taken a different dimension to work. And it has been tremendously useful. All the wrong people automatically disappeared and a totally different quality of people started arriving. It worked well. It sorted out well, only those who are ready to dissolve with me, remained. All others escaped. They created space around me. Otherwise, they were crowding too much, and it was very difficult for the real seekers to come closer to me. The crowd disappeared. The word &quot;Bhagwan&quot; functioned like an atomic explosion. It did well. I am happy that I chose it.&quot;Shree is a polite form of address roughly equivalent to the English &quot;Sir&quot;; Bhagwan means &quot;blessed one&quot;, used in Indian tradition as a term of respect for a human being in whom the divine is no longer hidden but apparent. In Hinduism it can also be used to signify a deity or avatar. In many parts of India and South Asia, Bhagwan represents the abstract concept of a universal God to Hindus who are spiritual and religious but do not worship a specific deity.

Later, when he changed his name, he redefined the meaning of Bhagwan.

=== Pune ashram: 1974–1981 ===

While living in Mumbai he developed diabetes, asthma, and numerous allergies. In 1974, on the 21st anniversary of his experience in Jabalpur, he moved to a property in Koregaon Park, Pune, purchased with the help of Ma Yoga Mukta (Catherine Venizelos), a Greek shipping heiress. Rajneesh spoke at the Pune ashram from 1974 to 1981. The two adjoining houses and of land became the nucleus of an ashram, and the property is still the heart of the present-day OSHO International Meditation Resort. It allowed the regular audio recording and, later, video recording and printing of his discourses for worldwide distribution, enabling him to reach far larger audiences. The number of Western visitors increased sharply. The ashram soon featured an arts-and-crafts centre producing clothes, jewellery, ceramics, and organic cosmetics and hosted performances of theatre, music, and mime. From 1975, after the arrival of several therapists from the Human Potential Movement, the ashram began to complement meditations with a growing number of therapy groups, which became a major source of income for the ashram.

The Pune ashram was by all accounts an exciting and intense place to be, with an emotionally charged, madhouse-carnival atmosphere. The day began at 6:00 a.m. with Dynamic Meditation. From 8:00 am, Rajneesh gave a 60- to 90-minute spontaneous lecture in the ashram&#x27;s &quot;Buddha Hall&quot; auditorium, commenting on religious writings or answering questions from visitors and disciples. Until 1981, lecture series held in Hindi alternated with series held in English. During the day, various meditations and therapies took place, whose intensity was ascribed to the spiritual energy of Rajneesh&#x27;s &quot;buddhafield&quot;. In evening &quot;darshans&quot;, Rajneesh conversed with individual disciples or visitors and initiated disciples (&quot;gave sannyas&quot;). Sannyasins came for &quot;darshan&quot; when departing or returning or when they had anything they wanted to discuss.

To decide which therapies to participate in, visitors either consulted Rajneesh or selected according to their own preferences. Some of the early therapy groups in the ashram, such as the encounter group, were experimental, allowing a degree of physical aggression as well as sexual encounters between participants. Conflicting reports of injuries sustained in encounter group sessions began to appear in the press. Richard Price, at the time a prominent Human Potential Movement therapist and co-founder of the Esalen Institute, found the groups encouraged participants to &#x27;be violent&#x27; rather than &#x27;play at being violent&#x27; (the norm in encounter groups conducted in the United States), and criticized them for &quot;the worst mistakes of some inexperienced Esalen group leaders&quot;. Price is alleged to have exited the Pune ashram with a broken arm following a period of eight hours locked in a room with participants armed with wooden weapons. Bernard Gunther, his Esalen colleague, fared better in Pune and wrote a book, &quot;Dying for Enlightenment&quot;, featuring photographs and lyrical descriptions of the meditations and therapy groups. Violence in the therapy groups eventually ended in January 1979, when the ashram issued a press release stating that violence &quot;had fulfilled its function within the overall context of the ashram as an evolving spiritual commune&quot;.

Sannyasins who had &quot;graduated&quot; from months of meditation and therapy could apply to work in the ashram, in an environment that was consciously modelled on the community the Russian mystic Gurdjieff led in France in the 1930s. Key features incorporated from Gurdjieff were hard, unpaid labour, and supervisors chosen for their abrasive personality, both designed to provoke opportunities for self-observation and transcendence. Many disciples chose to stay for years. Besides the controversy around the therapies, allegations of drug use amongst sannyasin began to mar the ashram&#x27;s image. Some Western sannyasins were alleged to be financing extended stays in India through prostitution and drug-running. A few people later alleged that while Rajneesh was not directly involved, they discussed such plans and activities with him in &quot;darshan&quot; and he gave his blessing.
By the latter 1970s, the Pune ashram was too small to contain the rapid growth and Rajneesh asked that somewhere larger be found. Sannyasins from around India started looking for properties: those found included one in the province of Kutch in Gujarat and two more in India&#x27;s mountainous north. The plans were never implemented as mounting tensions between the ashram and the Janata Party government of Morarji Desai resulted in an impasse. Land-use approval was denied and, more importantly, the government stopped issuing visas to foreign visitors who indicated the ashram as their main destination. Besides, Desai&#x27;s government cancelled the tax-exempt status of the ashram with retrospective effect, resulting in a claim estimated at $5 million. Conflicts with various Indian religious leaders aggravated the situation—by 1980 the ashram had become so controversial that Indira Gandhi, despite a previous association between Rajneesh and the Indian Congress Party dating back to the sixties, was unwilling to intercede for it after her return to power. In May 1980, during one of Rajneesh&#x27;s discourses, an attempt on his life was made by Vilas Tupe, a young Hindu fundamentalist. Tupe claims that he undertook the attack because he believed Rajneesh to be an agent of the CIA.

By 1981, Rajneesh&#x27;s ashram hosted 30,000 visitors per year. Daily discourse audiences were by then predominantly European and American. Many observers noted that Rajneesh&#x27;s lecture style changed in the late &#x27;70s, becoming less focused intellectually and featuring an increasing number of ethnic or dirty jokes intended to shock or amuse his audience. On 10 April 1981, having discoursed daily for nearly 15 years, Rajneesh entered a three-and-a-half-year period of self-imposed public silence, and &quot;satsangs&quot;—silent sitting with music and readings from spiritual works such as Khalil Gibran&#x27;s &quot;The Prophet&quot; or the &quot;Isha Upanishad&quot;—replaced discourses. Around the same time, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman) replaced Ma Yoga Laxmi as Rajneesh&#x27;s secretary.

=== United States and the Oregon commune: 1981–1985 ===
====Arrival in the United States====
In 1981, the increased tensions around the Pune ashram, along with criticism of its activities and threatened punitive action by Indian authorities, provided an impetus for the ashram to consider the establishment of a new commune in the United States. According to Susan J. Palmer, the move to the United States was a plan from Sheela. Sheela and Rajneesh had discussed the idea of establishing a new commune in the US in late 1980, although he did not agree to travel there until May 1981. On 1 June that year he travelled to the United States on a tourist visa, ostensibly for medical purposes, and spent several months at a Rajneeshee retreat centre located at Kip&#x27;s Castle in Montclair, New Jersey. He had been diagnosed with a prolapsed disc in early 1981 and treated by several doctors, including James Cyriax, a St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital musculoskeletal physician and expert in epidural injections flown in from London. Rajneesh&#x27;s previous secretary, Laxmi, reported to Frances FitzGerald that &quot;she had failed to find a property in India adequate to Rajneesh&#x27;s needs, and thus, when the medical emergency came, the initiative had passed to Sheela&quot;. A public statement by Sheela indicated that Rajneesh was in grave danger if he remained in India, but would receive appropriate medical treatment in America if he needed surgery. Despite the stated serious nature of the situation, Rajneesh never sought outside medical treatment during his time in the United States, leading the Immigration and Naturalization Service to contend that he had a preconceived intent to remain there. Years later, Rajneesh pleaded guilty to immigration fraud, while maintaining his innocence of the charges that he made false statements on his initial visa application about his alleged intention to remain in the US when he came from India.

====Establishing Rajneeshpuram====
On 13 June 1981, Sheela&#x27;s husband, John Shelfer, signed a purchase contract to buy property in Oregon for US$5.75 million, and a few days later assigned the property to the US foundation. The property was a ranch, previously known as &quot;The Big Muddy Ranch&quot; and located across two counties (Wasco and Jefferson). It was renamed &quot;Rancho Rajneesh&quot; and Rajneesh moved there on 29 August. Initial local community reactions ranged from hostility to tolerance, depending on distance from the ranch. The press reported, and another study found, that the development met almost immediately with intense local, state, and federal opposition from the government, press, and citizenry. Within months a series of legal battles ensued, principally over land use. Within a year of arriving, Rajneesh and his followers had become embroiled in a series of legal battles with their neighbours, the principal conflict relating to land use. The commune leadership was uncompromising and behaved impatiently in dealing with the locals. They were also insistent upon having demands met, and engaged in implicitly threatening and directly confrontational behaviour. Whatever the true intention, the repeated changes in their stated plans looked to many like conscious deception.

In May 1982 the residents of Rancho Rajneesh voted to incorporate it as the city of Rajneeshpuram. The conflict with local residents escalated, with increasingly bitter hostility on both sides, and over the following years, the commune was subject to constant and coordinated pressures from various coalitions of Oregon residents. 1000 Friends of Oregon immediately commenced and then prosecuted over the next six years numerous court and administrative actions to void the incorporation and cause buildings and improvement to be removed. 1000 Friends publicly called for the city to be &quot;dismantled&quot;. A 1000 Friends Attorney stated that if 1000 Friends won, the Foundation would be &quot;forced to remove their sewer system and tear down many of the buildings. At one point, the commune imported large numbers of homeless people from various US cities in a failed attempt to affect the outcome of an election, before releasing them into surrounding towns and leaving some to the State of Oregon to return to their home cities at the state&#x27;s expense. In March 1982, local residents formed a group called Citizens for Constitutional Cities to oppose the Ranch development. An initiative petition was filed that would order the governor to contain, control and remove&#x27; the threat of invasion by an &#x27;alien cult.

The Oregon legislature passed several bills that sought to slow or stop the development and the City of Rajneeshpuram—including HB 3080, which stopped distribution of revenue sharing funds for any city whose legal status had been challenged. Rajneeshpuram was the only city impacted. The Governor of Oregon, Vic Atiyeh, stated in 1982 that since their neighbors did not like them, they should leave Oregon. In May 1982, United States Senator Mark Hatfield called the INS in Portland. An INS memo stated that the Senator was &quot;very concerned&quot; about how this &quot;religious cult&quot; is &quot;endangering the way of life for a small agricultural town ... and is a threat to public safety&quot;. Such actions &quot;often do have influence on immigration decisions&quot;. In 1983 the Oregon Attorney General filed a lawsuit seeking to declare the City void because of an alleged violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution. The Court found that the City property was owned and controlled by the Foundation, and entered judgement for the State. The court disregarded the controlling US constitutional cases requiring that a violation be redressed by the &quot;least intrusive means&quot; necessary to correct the violation, which it had earlier cited. The city was forced to &quot;acquiesce&quot; in the decision, as part of a settlement of Rajneesh&#x27;s immigration case.
While the various legal battles ensued Rajneesh remained behind the scenes, having withdrawn from a public facing role in what commune leadership referred to as a period of &quot;silence.&quot; During this time, which lasted until November 1984, in lieu of Rajneesh speaking publicly, videos of his discourses were played to commune audiences. His time was allegedly spent mostly in seclusion and he communicated only with a few key disciples, including Ma Anand Sheela and his caretaker girlfriend Ma Yoga Vivek (Christine Woolf). He lived in a trailer next to a covered swimming pool and other amenities. At this time he did not lecture and interacted with followers via a Rolls-Royce &#x27;drive-by&#x27; ceremony. He also gained public notoriety for amassing a large collection of Rolls-Royce cars, eventually numbering 93 vehicles. In 1981 he had given Sheela limited power of attorney, removing any remaining limits the following year. In 1983, Sheela announced that he would henceforth speak only with her. He later said that she kept him in ignorance. Many sannyasins expressed doubts about whether Sheela properly represented Rajneesh and many dissidents left Rajneeshpuram in protest of its autocratic leadership. Resident sannyasins without US citizenship experienced visa difficulties that some tried to overcome by marriages of convenience. Commune administrators tried to resolve Rajneesh&#x27;s own difficulty in this respect by declaring him the head of a religion, &quot;Rajneeshism&quot;.

During the Oregon years there was an increased emphasis on Rajneesh&#x27;s prediction that the world might be destroyed by nuclear war or other disasters in the 1990s. Rajneesh had said as early as 1964 that &quot;the third and last war is now on the way&quot; and frequently spoke of the need to create a &quot;new humanity&quot; to avoid global suicide. This now became the basis for a new exclusivity, and a 1983 article in the Rajneesh Foundation Newsletter, announcing that &quot;Rajneeshism is creating a Noah&#x27;s Ark of consciousness ... I say to you that except this there is no other way&quot;, increased the sense of urgency in building the Oregon commune. In March 1984, Sheela announced that Rajneesh had predicted the death of two-thirds of humanity from AIDS. Sannyasins were required to wear rubber gloves and condoms if they had sex, and to refrain from kissing, measures widely represented in the press as an extreme over-reaction since condoms were not usually recommended for AIDS prevention because AIDS was considered a homosexual disease at that stage. During his residence in Rajneeshpuram, Rajneesh also dictated three books under the influence of nitrous oxide administered to him by his private dentist: &quot;Glimpses of a Golden Childhood&quot;, &quot;Notes of a Madman&quot; and &quot;Books I Have Loved&quot;. Sheela later stated that Rajneesh took sixty milligrams of valium each day and was addicted to nitrous oxide. Rajneesh denied these charges when questioned about them by journalists.

At the peak of the Rajneeshpuram era, Rajneesh, assisted by a sophisticated legal and business infrastructure, had created a corporate machine consisting of various front companies and subsidiaries. At this time, the three main identifiable entities within his organisation were: the Ranch Church, or Rajneesh International Foundation (RIF); the Rajneesh Investment Corporation (RIC), through which the RIF was managed; and the Rajneesh Neo-Sannyasin International Commune (RNSIC). The umbrella organisation that oversaw all investment activities was Rajneesh Services International Ltd., a company incorporated in the UK but based in Zürich. There were also smaller organisations, such as Rajneesh Travel Corp, Rajneesh Community Holdings, and the Rajneesh Modern Car Collection Trust, whose sole purpose was to deal with the acquisition and rental of Rolls-Royces.

==== 1984 bioterror attack ====
Rajneesh had coached Sheela in using media coverage to her advantage and during his period of public silence he privately stated that when Sheela spoke, she was speaking on his behalf. He had also supported her when disputes about her behaviour arose within the commune leadership, but in early 1984, as tension amongst the inner circle peaked, a private meeting was convened with Sheela and his personal house staff. According to the testimony of Rajneesh&#x27;s dentist, Swami Devageet (Charles Harvey Newman), she was admonished during a meeting, with Rajneesh declaring that his house, and not hers, was the centre of the commune. Devageet claimed Rajneesh warned that Sheela&#x27;s jealousy of anyone close to him would inevitably make them a target.

Several months later, on 30 October 1984, he ended his period of public silence, announcing that it was time to &quot;speak his own truths&quot;. On 19 December, Rajneesh was asked if organisation was necessary for a religion to survive. Disciples present during the talk remember Rajneesh stating that &quot;I will not leave you under a fascist regime&quot;. According to the testimony of Rajneesh&#x27;s dentist, Swami Devageet, this statement seemed directly aimed at Sheela - or to be directly against the present organisational structure. The next day, sannyasins usually responsible for the editing and transcribing of the talks into book form were told by the management that the tapes of the discourse had been irreparably damaged by technical trouble and were unavailable. After rumours that Sheela had suppressed the discourse grew, Sheela created a transcription of the talk, which was reproduced in The Rajneesh Times. All suggestions that Rajneeshpuram itself had become a fascist state and Sheela was, in the words of Ma Prem Sangeet, &quot;Hitler in a red dress&quot;, had been deleted.

Rajneesh spoke almost daily, except for a three-month gap between April and July 1985. 
In July, he resumed daily public discourses; on 16 September, a few days after Sheela and her entire management team had suddenly left the commune for Europe, Rajneesh held a press conference in which he labelled Sheela and her associates a &quot;gang of fascists&quot;. He accused them of having committed serious crimes, most dating back to 1984, and invited the authorities to investigate.

The alleged crimes, which he stated had been committed without his knowledge or consent, included the attempted murder of his personal physician, poisonings of public officials in Oregon, wiretapping and bugging within the commune and within his own home, and a potentially lethal bioterror attack sickening 751 citizens of The Dalles, using &quot;Salmonella&quot; to impact county elections. While his allegations were initially greeted with scepticism by outside observers, the subsequent investigation by U.S. authorities confirmed these accusations and resulted in the conviction of Sheela and several of her lieutenants.
On 30 September 1985, Rajneesh denied that he was a religious teacher. His disciples burned 5,000 copies the book &quot;Rajneeshism: An Introduction to Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and His Religion&quot;, a 78-page compilation of his teachings that defined &quot;Rajneeshism&quot; as &quot;a religionless religion&quot;. He said he ordered the book-burning to rid the sect of the last traces of the influence of Sheela, whose robes were also &quot;added to the bonfire&quot;.

The salmonella attack is considered the first confirmed instance of chemical or biological terrorism to have occurred in the United States. Rajneesh stated that because he was in silence and isolation, meeting only with Sheela, he was unaware of the crimes committed by the Rajneeshpuram leadership until Sheela and her &quot;gang&quot; left and sannyasins came forward to inform him. A number of commentators have stated that they believe that Sheela was being used as a convenient scapegoat. Others have pointed to the fact that although Sheela had bugged Rajneesh&#x27;s living quarters and made her tapes available to the U.S. authorities as part of her own plea bargain, no evidence has ever come to light that Rajneesh had any part in her crimes. It was, however, reported that Charles Turner, David Frohnmayer, and other law enforcement officials, who had surveyed affidavits never released publicly and who listened to hundreds of hours of tape recordings, insinuated to him that Rajneesh was guilty of more crimes than those for which he was eventually prosecuted. Frohnmayer asserted that Rajneesh&#x27;s philosophy was not &quot;disapproving of poisoning&quot; and that he felt he and Sheela had been &quot;genuinely evil&quot;. 

Nonetheless, U.S. Attorney Turner and Oregon Attorney General Frohnmeyer acknowledged that &quot;they had little evidence of (Rajneesh) being involved in any of the criminal activities that unfolded at the ranch&quot;. According to court testimony by Ma Ava (Ava Avalos), a prominent disciple, Sheela played associates a tape recording of a meeting she had with Rajneesh about the &quot;need to kill people&quot; to strengthen wavering sannyasins&#x27; resolve in participating in her murderous plots, but it was difficult to hear, so Sheela produced a transcript of the tape. &quot;She came back to the meeting and ... began to play the tape. It was a little hard to hear what he was saying. ... But Param Bodhi, assisted her, and went and transcribed it. And the gist of Bhagwan&#x27;s response, yes, it was going to be necessary to kill people to stay in Oregon. And that actually killing people wasn&#x27;t such a bad thing. And actually Hitler was a great man, although he could not say that publicly because nobody would understand that. Hitler had great vision.&quot; Rajneesh&#x27;s personal attorney Philip Niren Toelkes, wrote in 2021 that, &quot;As is fully supported in the testimony of Ava Avalos, an admitted co-conspirator, Sheela presented Osho with a general question about whether people would have to die if the Community was attacked and used his general response that it would perhaps be necessary. Sheela then took an edited recording and &#x27;transcript&#x27; of the recording, prepared under her control, back to a meeting to justify her planned criminal actions and overcome the reservations of her co-conspirators.&quot; Ava Avalos also said in her testimony to the FBI investigators that &quot;Sheela informed them that Bhagwan was not to know what was going on, and that if Bhagwan were to ask them about anything that would occur, &#x27;they would have to lie to Bhagwan&#x27;.&quot;

Sheela initiated attempts to murder Rajneesh&#x27;s caretaker and girlfriend, Ma Yoga Vivek, and his personal physician, Swami Devaraj (George Meredith), because she thought that they were a threat to Rajneesh. She had secretly recorded a conversation between Devaraj and Rajneesh &quot;in which the doctor agreed to obtain drugs the guru wanted to ensure a peaceful death if he decided to take his own life&quot;. When asked if he was targeted because of a plan to give the guru euthanasia in a 2018 interview with ‘The Cut’, Rajneesh&#x27;s doctor denied this and claimed that &quot;She attacked his household and everybody in it and found any excuse she could to do that. She constantly hated the fact that we had access to Osho. We were a constant threat to her total monopoly on power. &quot;

On 23 October 1985, a federal grand jury indicted Rajneesh and several other disciples with conspiracy to evade immigration laws. The indictment was returned in camera, but word was leaked to Rajneesh&#x27;s lawyer. Negotiations to allow Rajneesh to surrender to authorities in Portland if a warrant were issued failed. Rumours of a national guard takeover and a planned violent arrest of Rajneesh led to tension and fears of shooting. On the strength of Sheela&#x27;s tape recordings, authorities later said they believed that there had been a plan that sannyasin women and children would have been asked to create a human shield if authorities tried to arrest Rajneesh at the commune. On 28 October, Rajneesh and a small number of sannyasins accompanying him were arrested aboard two rented Learjets in North Carolina at Charlotte Douglas International Airport; according to federal authorities the group was en route to Bermuda to avoid prosecution. Cash amounting to $58,000, as well as 35 watches and bracelets worth a combined $1 million, were found on the aircraft. Rajneesh had by all accounts been informed neither of the impending arrest nor the reason for the journey. Officials took the full ten days legally available to transfer him from North Carolina to Portland for arraignment, which included three nights near Oklahoma City.

In Portland on 8 November before U.S. District Court Judge Edward Leavy, Rajneesh pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to all 34 charges, was released on $500,000 bail, and returned to the commune at Rajneeshpuram. On the advice of his lawyers, he later entered an &quot;Alford plea&quot;—a type of guilty plea through which a suspect does not admit guilt, but does concede there is enough evidence to convict him—to one count of having a concealed intent to remain permanently in the U.S. at the time of his original visa application in 1981 and one count of having conspired to have sannyasins enter into a sham marriage to acquire U.S. residency. Under the deal his lawyers made with the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office he was given a ten-year suspended sentence, five years&#x27; probation, and a $400,000 penalty in fines and prosecution costs and agreed to leave the United States, not returning for at least five years without the permission of the U.S. Attorney General.

As to &quot;preconceived intent&quot;, at the time of the investigation and prosecution, federal court appellate cases and the INS regulations permitted &quot;dual intent&quot;, a desire to stay, but a willingness to comply with the law if denied permanent residence. Further, the relevant intent is that of the employer, not the employee. Given the public nature of Rajneesh&#x27;s arrival and stay, and the aggressive scrutiny by the INS, Rajneesh would appear to have had to be willing to leave the U.S. if denied benefits. The government nonetheless prosecuted him based on preconceived intent. As to arranging a marriage, the government only claimed that Rajneesh told someone who lived in his house that they should marry to stay. Such encouragement appears to constitute incitement, a crime in the United States, but not a conspiracy, which requires the formation of a plan and acts in furtherance.

=== Travels and return to Pune: 1985–1990 ===
Following his exit from the US, Rajneesh returned to India, landing in Delhi on 17 November 1985. He was given a hero&#x27;s welcome by his Indian disciples and denounced the United States, saying the world must &quot;put the monster America in its place&quot; and that &quot;Either America must be hushed up or America will be the end of the world.&quot; He then stayed for six weeks in Manali, Himachal Pradesh. In Manali, Rajneesh said that he was interested in buying, for use as a possible new commune site, an atoll in the South Pacific that Marlon Brando was trying to sell. According to Rajneesh, the island could be made much bigger by the addition of houseboats and Japanese style floating gardens. Sannyasins visited the island, but it was deemed unsuitable after they realised the area was prone to hurricanes. When non-Indians in his party had their visas revoked, he moved on to Kathmandu, Nepal, and then, a few weeks later, to Crete. Arrested after a few days by the Greek National Intelligence Service (KYP), he flew to Geneva, then to Stockholm and London, but was in each case refused entry. Next Canada refused landing permission, so his plane returned to Shannon airport, Ireland, to refuel. There he was allowed to stay for two weeks at a hotel in Limerick, on condition that he did not go out or give talks. He had been granted a Uruguayan identity card, one-year provisional residency and a possibility of permanent residency, so the party set out, stopping at Madrid, where the plane was surrounded by the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot;. He was allowed to spend one night at Dakar, then continued to Recife and Montevideo. In Uruguay, the group moved to a house at Punta del Este where Rajneesh began speaking publicly until 19 June, after which he was &quot;invited to leave&quot; for no official reason. A two-week visa was arranged for Jamaica, but on arrival in Kingston police gave the group 12 hours to leave. Refuelling in Gander and in Madrid, Rajneesh returned to Bombay, India, on 30 July 1986.

In January 1987, Rajneesh returned to the ashram in Pune where he held evening discourses each day, except when interrupted by intermittent ill health. Publishing and therapy resumed and the ashram underwent expansion, now as a &quot;Multiversity&quot; where therapy was to function as a bridge to meditation. Rajneesh devised new &quot;meditation therapy&quot; methods such as the &quot;Mystic Rose&quot; and began to lead meditations in his discourses after a gap of more than ten years. His western disciples formed no large communes, mostly preferring ordinary independent living. Red/orange dress and the &quot;mala&quot; were largely abandoned, having been optional since 1985. The wearing of maroon robes—only while on &quot;ashram&quot; premises—was reintroduced in the summer of 1989, along with white robes worn for evening meditation and black robes for group leaders.

In November 1987, Rajneesh expressed his belief that his deteriorating health (nausea, fatigue, pain in extremities, and lack of resistance to infection) was due to poisoning by the US authorities while in prison. His doctors and former attorney, Philip Toelkes (Swami Prem Niren), hypothesised radiation and thallium in a deliberately irradiated mattress, since his symptoms were concentrated on the right side of his body, but presented no hard evidence. US attorney Charles H. Hunter described this as &quot;complete fiction&quot;, while others suggested exposure to HIV or chronic diabetes and stress.

From early 1988, Rajneesh&#x27;s discourses focused exclusively on Zen. In early 1989, Rajneesh gave a series of some of the longest lectures he had given, titled &quot;Communism and Zen Fire, Zen Wind&quot;, in which he criticised capitalism and spoke of the possibilities of sannyas in Russia. In these talks he stated that communism could evolve into spiritualism, and spiritualism into anarchism. &quot;I have always been very scientific in my approach, either outside or inside. Communism can be the base. Then spirituality has to be its growth, to provide what is missing.&quot; In late December, he said he no longer wished to be referred to as &quot;Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh&quot;, and in February 1989 took the name &quot;Osho Rajneesh&quot;, shortened to &quot;Osho&quot; in September. He also requested that all trademarks previously branded with &quot;Rajneesh&quot; be rebranded &quot;OSHO&quot;. His health continued to weaken. He delivered his last public discourse in April 1989, from then on simply sitting in silence with his followers. Shortly before his death, Rajneesh suggested that one or more audience members at evening meetings (now referred to as the &quot;White Robe Brotherhood&quot;) were subjecting him to some form of evil magic. A search for the perpetrators was undertaken, but none could be found.

=== Death ===
At age 58, Rajneesh died on 19 January 1990 at the ashram in Pune, India. The official cause of death was heart failure, but a statement released by his commune said that he died because &quot;living in the body had become a hell&quot; after an alleged poisoning in U.S. jails. His ashes were placed in his newly built bedroom in Lao Tzu House at the ashram in Pune. The epitaph reads, &quot;Never Born – Never Died Only visited this planet Earth between December 11, 1931 and January 19, 1990&quot;.

== Teachings ==
Rajneesh&#x27;s teachings, delivered through his discourses, were not presented in an academic setting, but interspersed with jokes. The emphasis was not static but changed over time: Rajneesh revelled in paradox and contradiction, making his work difficult to summarise. He delighted in engaging in behaviour that seemed entirely at odds with traditional images of enlightened individuals; his early lectures in particular were famous for their humour and their refusal to take anything seriously. All such behaviour, however capricious and difficult to accept, was explained as &quot;a technique for transformation&quot; to push people &quot;beyond the mind&quot;.

He spoke on major spiritual traditions including Jainism, Hinduism, Hassidism, Tantrism, Taoism, Sikhism, Sufism, Christianity, Buddhism, on a variety of Eastern and Western mystics and on sacred scriptures such as the &quot;Upanishads&quot; and the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;. The sociologist Lewis F. Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held to be a kind of dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself. While his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti did not approve of Rajneesh, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.

Rajneesh also drew on a wide range of Western ideas. His belief in the unity of opposites recalls Heraclitus, while his description of man as a machine, condemned to the helpless acting out of unconscious, neurotic patterns, has much in common with Sigmund Freud and George Gurdjieff. His vision of the &quot;new man&quot; transcending constraints of convention is reminiscent of Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;; his promotion of sexual liberation bears comparison to D. H. Lawrence; and his &quot;dynamic&quot; meditations owe a debt to Wilhelm Reich.

=== Ego and the mind ===
According to Rajneesh every human being is a &quot;Buddha&quot; with the capacity for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually prevents this, identifying with social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that is nothing but a barrier of dreams. Otherwise man&#x27;s innate being can flower in a move from the periphery to the centre.

Rajneesh viewed the mind first and foremost as a mechanism for survival, replicating behavioural strategies that have proven successful. However, the mind&#x27;s appeal to the past, he said, deprives human beings of the ability to live authentically in the present, causing them to repress genuine emotions and to shut themselves off from joyful experiences that arise naturally when embracing the present moment: &quot;The mind has no inherent capacity for joy.[...] It only thinks about joy.&quot; The result is that people poison themselves with all manner of neuroses, jealousies, and insecurities. He argued that psychological repression, often advocated by religious leaders, makes suppressed feelings re-emerge in another guise, and that sexual repression resulted in societies obsessed with sex. Instead of suppressing, people should trust and accept themselves unconditionally. This should not merely be understood intellectually, as the mind could only assimilate it as one more piece of information: instead meditation was needed.

=== Meditation ===
Rajneesh presented meditation not just as a practice, but as a state of awareness to be maintained in every moment, a total awareness that awakens the individual from the sleep of mechanical responses conditioned by beliefs and expectations. He employed Western psychotherapy in the preparatory stages of meditation to create awareness of mental and emotional patterns.

He suggested more than a hundred meditation techniques in total. His own &quot;active meditation&quot; techniques are characterised by stages of physical activity leading to silence. The most famous of these remains dynamic meditation, which has been described as a kind of microcosm of his outlook. Performed with closed or blindfolded eyes, it comprises five stages, four of which are accompanied by music. First the meditator engages in ten minutes of rapid breathing through the nose. The second ten minutes are for catharsis: &quot;Let whatever is happening happen.[...] Laugh, shout, scream, jump, shake—whatever you feel to do, do it!&quot; Next, for ten minutes one jumps up and down with arms raised, shouting &quot;Hoo!&quot; each time one lands on the flat of the feet. At the fourth, silent stage, the meditator stops moving suddenly and totally, remaining completely motionless for fifteen minutes, witnessing everything that is happening. The last stage of the meditation consists of fifteen minutes of dancing and celebration.

Rajneesh developed other active meditation techniques, such as the Kundalini &quot;shaking&quot; meditation and the Nadabrahma &quot;humming&quot; meditation, which are less animated, although they also include physical activity of one sort or another. He also used to organise Gibberish sessions in which disciples were asked to just blabber meaningless sounds, which according to him clears out garbage from mind and relaxes it. His later &quot;meditative therapies&quot; require sessions for several days, OSHO Mystic Rose comprising three hours of laughing every day for a week, three hours of weeping each day for a second week, and a third week with three hours of silent meditation. These processes of &quot;witnessing&quot; enable a &quot;jump into awareness&quot;. Rajneesh believed such cathartic methods were necessary because it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation. Once these methods had provided a glimpse of meditation, then people would be able to use other methods without difficulty.

=== &quot;Sannyas&quot; ===
Another key ingredient was his own presence as a master: &quot;A Master shares his being with you, not his philosophy[...] He never does anything to the disciple.&quot; The initiation he offered was another such device: &quot;if your being can communicate with me, it becomes a communion[...] It is the highest form of communication possible: a transmission without words. Our beings merge. This is possible only if you become a disciple.&quot; Ultimately though, as an explicitly &quot;self-parodying&quot; guru, Rajneesh even deconstructed his own authority, declaring his teaching to be nothing more than a &quot;game&quot; or a joke. He emphasised that anything and everything could become an opportunity for meditation.

=== Renunciation and the &quot;New Man&quot; ===
Rajneesh saw his &quot;neo-sannyas&quot; as a totally new form of spiritual discipline, or one that had once existed but since been forgotten. He thought that the traditional Hindu sannyas had turned into a mere system of social renunciation and imitation. He emphasised complete inner freedom and the responsibility to oneself, not demanding superficial behavioural changes, but a deeper, inner transformation. Desires were to be accepted and surpassed rather than denied. Once this inner flowering had taken place, desires such as that for sex would be left behind.

Rajneesh said that he was &quot;the rich man&#x27;s guru&quot; and that material poverty was not a genuine spiritual value. He had himself photographed wearing sumptuous clothing and hand-made watches and, while in Oregon, drove a different Rolls-Royce each day – his followers reportedly wanted to buy him 365 of them, one for each day of the year. Publicity shots of the Rolls-Royces were sent to the press. They may have reflected both his advocacy of wealth and his desire to provoke American sensibilities, much as he had enjoyed offending Indian sensibilities earlier.

Rajneesh aimed to create a &quot;new man&quot; combining the spirituality of Gautama Buddha with the zest for life embodied by Nikos Kazantzakis&#x27; &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot;: &quot;He should be as accurate and objective as a scientist[...] as sensitive, as full of heart, as a poet[...] [and as] rooted deep down in his being as the mystic.&quot; His term the &quot;new man&quot; applied to men and women equally, whose roles he saw as complementary; most of his movement&#x27;s leadership positions were held by women. This new man, &quot;Zorba the Buddha&quot;, should reject neither science nor spirituality but embrace both. Rajneesh believed humanity was threatened with extinction due to over-population, impending nuclear holocaust and diseases such as AIDS, and thought many of society&#x27;s ills could be remedied by scientific means. The new man would no longer be trapped in institutions such as family, marriage, political ideologies and religions. In this respect Rajneesh is similar to other counter-culture gurus, and perhaps even certain postmodern and deconstructional thinkers. Rajneesh said that the new man had to be &quot;utterly ambitionless&quot;, as opposed to a life that depended on ambition. The new man, he said, &quot;is not necessarily the better man. He will be livelier. He will be more joyous. He will be more alert. But who knows whether he will be better or not? As far as politicians are concerned, he will not be better, because he will not be a better soldier. He will not be ready to be a soldier at all. He will not be competitive, and the whole competitive economy will collapse.&quot;

===&quot;Heart to heart communion&quot;===
In April 1981, Rajneesh had sent a message that he was entering the ultimate stage of his work, and would now speak only through silence. On 1 May 1981, Rajneesh stopped speaking publicly and entered a phase of &quot;silent heart to heart communion&quot;.

Rajneesh stated in the first talk he gave after ending three years of public silence on 30 October 1984, that he had gone into silence partly to put off those who were only intellectually following him.

=== Rajneesh&#x27;s &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; ===
In his early days as Acharya Rajneesh, a correspondent once asked for his &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;. In reply, Rajneesh said that it was a difficult matter because he was against any kind of commandment, but &quot;just for fun&quot;, set out the following:

#Never obey anyone&#x27;s command unless it is coming from within you also.
#There is no God other than life itself.
#Truth is within you, do not search for it elsewhere.
#Love is prayer. 
#To become a nothingness is the door to truth. Nothingness itself is the means, the goal and attainment.
#Life is now and here. 
#Live wakefully.
#Do not swim – float.
#Die each moment so that you can be new each moment.
#Do not search. That which is, is. Stop and see.

He underlined numbers 3, 7, 9 and 10. The ideas expressed in these commandments have remained constant leitmotifs in his movement.

== Legacy ==
While Rajneesh&#x27;s teachings were not welcomed by many in his own home country during his lifetime, there has been a change in Indian public opinion since Rajneesh&#x27;s death. In 1991, an Indian newspaper counted Rajneesh, along with figures such as Gautama Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi, among the ten people who had most changed India&#x27;s destiny; in Rajneesh&#x27;s case, by &quot;liberating the minds of future generations from the shackles of religiosity and conformism&quot;. Rajneesh has found more acclaim in his homeland since his death than he did while alive. Writing in &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, columnist Tanweer Alam stated, &quot;The late Rajneesh was a fine interpreter of social absurdities that destroyed human happiness.&quot; At a celebration in 2006, marking the 75th anniversary of Rajneesh&#x27;s birth, Indian singer Wasifuddin Dagar said that Rajneesh&#x27;s teachings are &quot;more pertinent in the current milieu than they were ever before&quot;. In Nepal, there were 60 Rajneesh centres with almost 45,000 initiated disciples as of January 2008. Rajneesh&#x27;s entire works have been placed in the Library of India&#x27;s National Parliament in New Delhi. The Bollywood actor, and former Minister of State for External Affairs, Vinod Khanna, worked as Rajneesh&#x27;s gardener in Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s. Over 650 books are credited to Rajneesh, expressing his views on all facets of human existence. Virtually all of them are renderings of his taped discourses. Many Bollywood personalities like Parveen Babi and Mahesh Bhatt were also known to be the followers of Rajneesh&#x27;s philosophy. His books are available in more than 60 languages from more than 200 publishing houses and have entered best-seller lists in Italy and South Korea.

Rajneesh continues to be known and published worldwide in the area of meditation and his work also includes social and political commentary. Internationally, after almost two decades of controversy and a decade of accommodation, Rajneesh&#x27;s movement has established itself in the market of new religions. His followers have redefined his contributions, reframing central elements of his teaching so as to make them appear less controversial to outsiders. Societies in North America and Western Europe have met them half-way, becoming more accommodating to spiritual topics such as yoga and meditation. The Osho International Foundation (OIF) runs stress management seminars for corporate clients such as IBM and BMW, with a reported (2000) revenue between $15 and $45 million annually in the US. In Italy, a satirical Facebook page titled Le più belle frasi di Osho repurposing pictures of Osho with humorous captions about national politics was launched in 2016 and quickly surpassed a million followers, becoming a cultural phenomenon in the country, with posts being republished by national papers and being shown on television.

Rajneesh&#x27;s ashram in Pune has become the OSHO International Meditation Resort Describing itself as the Esalen of the East, it teaches a variety of spiritual techniques from a broad range of traditions and promotes itself as a spiritual oasis, a &quot;sacred space&quot; for discovering one&#x27;s self and uniting the desires of body and mind in a beautiful resort environment. According to press reports, prominent visitors have included politicians and media personalities. In 2011, a national seminar on Rajneesh&#x27;s teachings was inaugurated at the Department of Philosophy of the Mankunwarbai College for Women in Jabalpur. Funded by the Bhopal office of the University Grants Commission, the seminar focused on Rajneesh&#x27;s &quot;Zorba the Buddha&quot; teaching, seeking to reconcile spirituality with the materialist and objective approach. As of 2013, the resort required all guests to be tested for HIV/AIDS at its Welcome Centre on arrival.

== Reception ==
Rajneesh is generally considered one of the most controversial spiritual leaders to have emerged from India in the twentieth century. His message of sexual, emotional, spiritual, and institutional liberation, as well as the pleasure he took in causing offence, ensured that his life was surrounded by controversy. Rajneesh became known as the &quot;sex guru&quot; in India, and as the &quot;Rolls-Royce guru&quot; in the United States. He attacked traditional concepts of nationalism, openly expressed contempt for politicians, and poked fun at the leading figures of various religions, who in turn found his arrogance insufferable. His teachings on sex, marriage, family, and relationships contradicted traditional values and aroused a great deal of anger and opposition around the world. His movement was widely considered a cult. Rajneesh was seen to live &quot;in ostentation and offensive opulence&quot;, while his followers, most of whom had severed ties with outside friends and family and donated all or most of their money and possessions to the commune, might be at a mere &quot;subsistence level&quot;.

=== Appraisal by scholars of religion ===
Academic assessments of Rajneesh&#x27;s work have been mixed and often directly contradictory. Uday Mehta saw errors in his interpretation of Zen and Mahayana Buddhism, speaking of &quot;gross contradictions and inconsistencies in his teachings&quot; that &quot;exploit&quot; the &quot;ignorance and gullibility&quot; of his listeners. The sociologist Bob Mullan wrote in 1983 of &quot;a borrowing of truths, half-truths and occasional misrepresentations from the great traditions... often bland, inaccurate, spurious and extremely contradictory&quot;. American religious studies professor Hugh B. Urban also said Rajneesh&#x27;s teaching was neither original nor especially profound, and concluded that most of its content had been borrowed from various Eastern and Western philosophies. George Chryssides, on the other hand, found such descriptions of Rajneesh&#x27;s teaching as a &quot;potpourri&quot; of various religious teachings unfortunate because Rajneesh was &quot;no amateur philosopher&quot;. Drawing attention to Rajneesh&#x27;s academic background he stated that; &quot;Whether or not one accepts his teachings, he was no charlatan when it came to expounding the ideas of others.&quot; He described Rajneesh as primarily a Buddhist teacher, promoting an independent form of &quot;Beat Zen&quot; and viewed the unsystematic, contradictory and outrageous aspects of Rajneesh&#x27;s teachings as seeking to induce a change in people, not as philosophy lectures aimed at intellectual understanding of the subject.

Similarly with respect to Rajneesh&#x27;s embracing of Western counter-culture and the human potential movement, though Mullan acknowledged that Rajneesh&#x27;s range and imagination were second to none, and that many of his statements were quite insightful and moving, perhaps even profound at times, he perceived &quot;a potpourri of counter-culturalist and post-counter-culturalist ideas&quot; focusing on love and freedom, the need to live for the moment, the importance of self, the feeling of &quot;being okay&quot;, the mysteriousness of life, the fun ethic, the individual&#x27;s responsibility for their own destiny, and the need to drop the ego, along with fear and guilt. Mehta notes that Rajneesh&#x27;s appeal to his Western disciples was based on his social experiments, which established a philosophical connection between the Eastern guru tradition and the Western growth movement. He saw this as a marketing strategy to meet the desires of his audience. Urban, too, viewed Rajneesh as negating a dichotomy between spiritual and material desires, reflecting the preoccupation with the body and sexuality characteristic of late capitalist consumer culture and in tune with the socio-economic conditions of his time.

The British professor of religious studies Peter B. Clarke said that most participators felt they had made progress in self-actualisation as defined by American psychologist Abraham Maslow and the human potential movement. He stated that the style of therapy Rajneesh devised, with its liberal attitude towards sexuality as a sacred part of life, had proved influential among other therapy practitioners and new age groups. Yet Clarke believes that the main motivation of seekers joining the movement was &quot;neither therapy nor sex, but the prospect of becoming enlightened, in the classical Buddhist sense&quot;.

In 2005, Urban observed that Rajneesh had undergone a &quot;remarkable apotheosis&quot; after his return to India, and especially in the years since his death, going on to describe him as a powerful illustration of what F. Max Müller, over a century ago, called &quot;that world-wide circle through which, like an electric current, Oriental thought could run to the West and Western thought return to the East&quot;. Clarke also said that Rajneesh has come to be &quot;seen as an important teacher within India itself&quot; who is &quot;increasingly recognised as a major spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, at the forefront of the current &#x27;world-accepting&#x27; trend of spirituality based on self-development&quot;.

=== Appraisal as charismatic leader ===
A number of commentators have remarked upon Rajneesh&#x27;s charisma. Comparing Rajneesh with Gurdjieff, Anthony Storr wrote that Rajneesh was &quot;personally extremely impressive&quot;, noting that &quot;many of those who visited him for the first time felt that their most intimate feelings were instantly understood, that they were accepted and unequivocally welcomed rather than judged. [Rajneesh] seemed to radiate energy and to awaken hidden possibilities in those who came into contact with him&quot;. Many sannyasins have stated that hearing Rajneesh speak, they &quot;fell in love with him&quot;. Susan J. Palmer noted that even critics attested to the power of his presence. James S. Gordon, a psychiatrist and researcher, recalls inexplicably finding himself laughing like a child, hugging strangers and having tears of gratitude in his eyes after a glance by Rajneesh from within his passing Rolls-Royce. Frances FitzGerald concluded upon listening to Rajneesh in person that he was a brilliant lecturer, and expressed surprise at his talent as a comedian, which had not been apparent from reading his books, as well as the hypnotic quality of his talks, which had a profound effect on his audience. Hugh Milne (Swami Shivamurti), an ex-devotee who between 1973 and 1982 worked closely with Rajneesh as leader of the Poona Ashram Guard and as his personal bodyguard, noted that their first meeting left him with a sense that far more than words had passed between them: &quot;There is no invasion of privacy, no alarm, but it is as if his soul is slowly slipping inside mine, and in a split second transferring vital information.&quot; Milne also observed another facet of Rajneesh&#x27;s charismatic ability in stating that he was &quot;a brilliant manipulator of the unquestioning disciple&quot;.

Hugh B. Urban said that Rajneesh appeared to fit with Max Weber&#x27;s classical image of the charismatic figure, being held to possess &quot;an extraordinary supernatural power or &#x27;grace&#x27;, which was essentially irrational and affective&quot;. Rajneesh corresponded to Weber&#x27;s pure charismatic type in rejecting all rational laws and institutions and claiming to subvert all hierarchical authority, though Urban said that the promise of absolute freedom inherent in this resulted in bureaucratic organisation and institutional control within larger communes.

Some scholars have suggested that Rajneesh may have had a narcissistic personality. In his paper &quot;The Narcissistic Guru: A Profile of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh&quot;, Ronald O. Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Religious Studies at Oregon State University, argued that Rajneesh exhibited all the typical features of narcissistic personality disorder, such as a grandiose sense of self-importance and uniqueness; a preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success; a need for constant attention and admiration; a set of characteristic responses to threats to self-esteem; disturbances in interpersonal relationships; a preoccupation with personal grooming combined with frequent resorting to prevarication or outright lying; and a lack of empathy. Drawing on Rajneesh&#x27;s reminiscences of his childhood in his book &quot;Glimpses of a Golden Childhood&quot;, he suggested that Rajneesh suffered from a fundamental lack of parental discipline, due to his growing up in the care of overindulgent grandparents. Rajneesh&#x27;s self-avowed Buddha status, he concluded, was part of a delusional system associated with his narcissistic personality disorder; a condition of ego-inflation rather than egolessness.

=== Wider appraisal as a thinker and speaker ===
There are widely divergent assessments of Rajneesh&#x27;s qualities as a thinker and speaker. Khushwant Singh, an eminent author, historian, and former editor of the &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, has described Rajneesh as &quot;the most original thinker that India has produced: the most erudite, the most clearheaded and the most innovative&quot;. Singh believes that Rajneesh was a &quot;free-thinking agnostic&quot; who had the ability to explain the most abstract concepts in simple language, illustrated with witty anecdotes, who mocked gods, prophets, scriptures, and religious practices, and gave a totally new dimension to religion. German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk, a one-time devotee of Rajneesh&#x27;s (living at the Pune ashram from 1978 to 1980), described him as a &quot;Wittgenstein of religions&quot;, ranking him as one of the greatest figures of the 20th century; in his view, Rajneesh had performed a radical deconstruction of the word games played by the world&#x27;s religions.

During the early 1980s, a number of commentators in the popular press were dismissive of Rajneesh. The Australian critic Clive James scornfully referred to him as &quot;Bagwash&quot;, likening the experience of listening to one of his discourses to sitting in a laundrette and watching &quot;your tattered underwear revolve soggily for hours while exuding grey suds. The Bagwash talks the way that he looks.&quot; James finished by saying that Rajneesh, though a &quot;fairly benign example of his type&quot;, was a &quot;rebarbative dingbat who manipulates the manipulable into manipulating one another&quot;. Responding to an enthusiastic review of Rajneesh&#x27;s talks by Bernard Levin in &quot;The Times&quot;, Dominik Wujastyk, also writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, similarly expressed his opinion that the talk he heard while visiting the Puna &quot;ashram&quot; was of a very low standard, wearyingly repetitive and often factually wrong, and stated that he felt disturbed by the personality cult surrounding Rajneesh.

Writing in the &quot;Seattle Post Intelligencer&quot; in January 1990, American author Tom Robbins stated that based on his readings of Rajneesh&#x27;s books, he was convinced Rajneesh was the 20th century&#x27;s &quot;greatest spiritual teacher&quot;. Robbins, while stressing that he was not a disciple, further stated that he had &quot;read enough vicious propaganda and slanted reports to suspect that he was one of the most maligned figures in history&quot;. Rajneesh&#x27;s commentary on the Sikh scripture known as &quot;Japuji&quot; was hailed as the best available by Giani Zail Singh, the former President of India. In 2011, author Farrukh Dhondy reported that film star Kabir Bedi was a fan of Rajneesh, and viewed Rajneesh&#x27;s works as &quot;the most sublime interpretations of Indian philosophy that he had come across&quot;. Dhondy himself said Rajneesh was &quot;the cleverest intellectual confidence trickster that India has produced. His output of the &#x27;interpretation&#x27; of Indian texts is specifically slanted towards a generation of disillusioned westerners who wanted (and perhaps still want) to &#x27;have their cake, eat it&#x27; [and] claim at the same time that cake-eating is the highest virtue according to ancient-fused-with-scientific wisdom.&quot;

<text>A speakeasy, also called a beer flat or blind pig or blind tiger, was an illicit establishment that sold alcoholic beverages. The term may also refer to a retro style bar that replicates aspects of historical speakeasies.

In the United States, speakeasy bars date back to at least the 1880s, but came into prominence in the United States during the Prohibition era (1920–1933, longer in some states). During that time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (bootlegging) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States, due to the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Speakeasies largely disappeared after Prohibition ended in 1933. The speakeasy-style trend began in 2000 with the opening of the bar Milk &amp; Honey.

==Etymology==
The phrase &quot;speak softly shop&quot;, meaning a &quot;smuggler&#x27;s house&quot;, appeared in a British slang dictionary published in 1823. The similar phrase &quot;speak easy shop&quot;, denoting a place where unlicensed liquor sales were made, appeared in a British naval memoir written in 1844.
The precise term &quot;speakeasy&quot; dates from no later than 1837 when an article in the &quot;Sydney Herald&quot; newspaper in Australia referred to &#x27;sly grog shops, called in slang terms &quot;speakeasy&#x27;s&quot; [sic] in this part – Boro Creek.&#x27;

In the United States, the word emerged in the 1880s. The first known recorded use is in a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania newspaper article from March 21, 1889, which refers to &quot;speak easy&quot; as the term used in the Pittsburgh-area town of McKeesport, Pennsylvania for &quot;a saloon that sells without a license&quot;. A later, June 30, 1889, Pittsburg Dispatch article explains the following:

&quot;Speak-easies&quot; have always existed, no matter who first called them by that name. They have been &quot;holes in the wall&quot; and various other things descriptive of their leading peculiarities, but it is only within very recent times, and in the city of Pittsburgh, that they have been dubbed &quot;speak-easies&quot;.
Speakeasies were &quot;so called because of the practice of speaking quietly about such a place in public, or when inside it, so as not to alert the police or neighbors&quot;. Although failing to account for earlier usage outside the U.S., The New York Times attributes the term to saloon owner Kate Hester, who ran an unlicensed bar in the 1880s in McKeesport, supposedly telling her rowdy customers to &quot;speak easy&quot; to avoid attention from authorities, which has become a common American anecdote. Many years later, in Prohibition-era America, the &quot;speakeasy&quot; became a common name to describe a place to get an illicit drink.

Different names for speakeasies were created. The terms &quot;blind pig&quot; and &quot;blind tiger&quot; originated in the United States in the 19th century. These terms were applied to establishments that sold alcoholic beverages illegally, and they are still in use today. The operator of an establishment (such as a saloon or bar) would charge customers to see an attraction (such as an animal) and then serve a &quot;complimentary&quot; alcoholic beverage, thus circumventing the law.

In desperate cases it has to betake itself to the exhibition of Greenland pigs and other curious animals, charging 25 cents for a sight of the pig and throwing in a gin cocktail gratuitously. [They] are in a mysterious place called a &quot;blind tiger&quot;, drinking the very bad whiskey for which Prohibition is indirectly responsible.

&quot;Blind tiger&quot; also referred to illegal drinking establishments in which the seller&#x27;s identity was concealed.

A drawer runs into a wall of what appears to be a billiard saloon. You pull out the drawer, drop in your change, shove the drawer back, call for what you want and then pull out the drawer again and there it is, &quot;Straight&quot; or &quot;Spiked&quot; just as you&#x27;d have it. Nobody is heard or seen, and the blind tiger, apparently without any keeper, works like a charm.

==History==
The first American speakeasies emerged in the Pittsburgh-area in the late 1880s. To manage the sale of &quot;intoxicating liquors,&quot; the Allegheny County Liquor Law was passed in 1872. This law introduced alcohol licenses, set closing times, banned sales to minors, and generally aimed to control the unruly environment. Pittsburgh barkeeps mostly complied with these regulations until 1888, when the Brooks High-License Act increased the annual license fee from $50 to $500. While a few bars paid the fee and others closed, most establishments went underground. By 1890, Pittsburgh had about 700 speakeasies but only 92 licensed liquor dealers. This led to national media attention, including a 1891 New York Times article noting:The commonest term in the police news of Pittsburg is the raid of a &quot;speak-easy&quot;. [...] the expression became common in McKeesport and spread to Pittsburg, Here the newspaper men accepted the term as filling a long-felt want. It now passes current all over the country as a descriptive of a resort where strong drink is sold without license.Speakeasies were numerous and popular during the Prohibition years (1920-1933). Some were operated by people who were part of organized crime. Even though police and agents of the Bureau of Prohibition would often raid them and arrest their owners and patrons, they were so profitable that they continued to flourish. The speakeasy soon became one of the biggest parts of American culture during this time. Several changes happened as speakeasies formed; one was with integration. People of all races, black or white, would gather together and even mingle. People would mix together and have few or no problems.

Another change that occurred was more participation from women. Many businesses would set up their speakeasies to attract women to get more profits. Women also began to insert themselves into the business of speakeasies. Texas Guinan, a former screen and stage actress, opened many speakeasies during Prohibition such as the 300 Club and the El Fey. Guinan greeted customers with &quot;Hey Suckers&quot; and admitted she would be nothing without Prohibition. Her two biggest competitors were Helen Morgan and Belle Livingston.

Speakeasies also affected culture during prohibition, and the speakeasy became a focal point. Films were restricted from depicting alcohol on screen, but some still continued to do so because they felt it showed the way Americans lived, such as the scene in &quot;Our Dancing Daughters&quot; in which Joan Crawford dances on a table in a speakeasy.

The poor quality bootleg liquor sold in some speakeasies was responsible for a shift away from 19th-century &quot;classic&quot; cocktails, that celebrated the raw taste of the liquor (such as the gin cocktail, made with Genever (sweet gin), to new cocktails aimed at masking the taste of rough moonshine. These masking drinks were termed &quot;pansies&quot; at the time (although some, such as the Brandy Alexander, would now be termed &quot;classic&quot;). 

The quality of the alcohol sold in speakeasies ranged from very poor to very good, depending on the owner&#x27;s source. Cheap liquor was generally used because it was more profitable. In other cases, brand names were used to specify the liquor customers wanted. However, sometimes when brand names were used, some speakeasies cheated; they lied to their customers by giving them poor quality liquor instead of the higher-quality liquor the customer ordered. Prices were four to five dollars a bottle.

Speakeasy-themed cocktail bars made a resurgence in the 2000s. In 2022, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the theme again became popular, especially in New York City.

==Varieties==
From the beginning the speakeasy was relatively small with little or no entertainment involved, but through gradual growth it popularized and expanded to many different areas with new additions of entertainment and eventually made the speakeasy one of the biggest businesses during Prohibition.

In many rural towns, small speakeasies and blind pigs were operated by local business owners. These family secrets were often kept even after Prohibition ended. In 2007 secret underground rooms thought to have been a speakeasy were found by renovators on the grounds of the Cyber Cafe West in Binghamton, New York.

Speakeasies did not need to be big to operate. &quot;It didn&#x27;t take much more than a bottle and two chairs to make a speakeasy.&quot; One example for a speakeasy location was the &quot;21&quot; Club in New York. This is one of the more famous of the speakeasies and operated until 2020. The &quot;21&quot; Club was only part of a series of businesses owned by Charlie Berns and Jack Kriendler. They started the business in Greenwich with a place called &quot;The Redhead&quot; and later moved onto the next operation &quot;The Puncheon Club&quot;. The &quot;21&quot; Club was special because of its system to remain under the radar. It was a unique system that used a doorkeeper to send a warning to the bar that it was in danger and the bar would transform into an ordinary place through a mechanism.The speakeasy spread all over New York with businesses such as the &quot;Bath Club&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s on the Bowery&quot;. &quot;The Bath Club&quot; had musicians perform in their place to keep it unique. This idea of musicians spread throughout the speakeasy business and soon enough many of them had musicians.

Beer flats were a residential version of the more upscale speakeasy, and were common in the midwestern United States.

<doc id="186228" wikidata="Q2215516" url="?curid=186228" title="Ideas and delusions of reference">
<text>Ideas of reference and delusions of reference describe the phenomenon of an individual experiencing innocuous events or mere coincidences and believing they have strong personal significance. It is &quot;the notion that everything one perceives in the world relates to one&#x27;s own destiny&quot;, usually in a negative and hostile manner.

In psychiatry, delusions of reference form part of the diagnostic criteria for psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder, and bipolar disorder with mania, as well as for the narcissistic and schizotypal types of personality disorder. To a lesser extent, their presence can be a hallmark of paranoid personality disorder, as well as body dysmorphic disorder. They can be found in autism during periods of intense stress. They can also be caused by intoxication, such as from stimulants like methamphetamine.

== Psychoanalytic views ==
In Sigmund Freud&#x27;s view, &quot;Delusions of being watched present this power in a regressive form, thus revealing its genesis...voices, as well as the undefined multitude, are brought into the foreground again by the [paranoid] disease, and so the evolution of conscience is reproduced regressively.&quot; As early as 1928, Freud&#x27;s contemporary, Carl Jung, introduced the concept of synchronicity, a theory of &quot;meaningful coincidences&quot;.

In 1946, Otto Fenichel concluded that &quot;the projection of the superego is most clearly seen in ideas of reference and of being influenced...Delusions of this kind merely bring to the patient from the outside what his self-observing and self-critical conscience actually tells him.&quot;

Jacques Lacan similarly saw ideas of reference as linked to &quot;the unbalancing of the relation to the capital Other and the radical anomaly that it involves, qualified, improperly, but not without some approximation to the truth, in old clinical medicine, as partial delusion&quot;—the &quot;big other, that is, the other of language, the Names-of-the-Father, signifiers or words&quot;, in short, the realm of the superego.

==Anti-psychiatry==

Validation rather than clinical condemnation of ideas of reference is frequently expressed by anti-psychiatrists, on the grounds, for example, that &quot;the patient&#x27;s ideas of reference and influence and delusions of persecution were merely descriptions of her parents&#x27; behavior toward her.&quot; While accepting that &quot;there is certainly confusion between persecutory fantasies and persecutory realities&quot;, figures like David Cooper believe that &quot;ideas of connection with apparently remote people, or ideas of being influenced by others equally remote, are in fact stating their experience&quot; of social influence – albeit in a distorted form by &quot;including in their network of influence institutions as absurd as Scotland Yard, the Queen of England, the President of the United States, or the BBC&quot;.

R. D. Laing took a similar view of the person who was &quot;saying that his brains have been taken from him, that his actions are controlled from outer space, etc. &quot;Such delusions are partially achieved derealization-realizations.&quot; Laing also considered how &quot;in typical paranoid ideas of reference, the person feels that the murmurings and mutterings he hears as he walks past a street crowd are about him. In a bar, a burst of laughter behind his back is at some joke cracked about him&quot;, but felt that deeper acquaintance with the patient reveals in fact that &quot;what tortures him is not so much his delusions of reference, but his harrowing suspicion that he is of no importance to anyone, that no one is referring to him at all.&quot;

==Delusions of reference==

Ideas of reference must be distinguished from delusions of reference, which may be similar in content but are held with greater conviction. With the former, but not the latter, the person holding them may have &quot;the &quot;feeling&quot; that strangers are talking about him/her, but if challenged, acknowledges that the people may be talking about something else&quot;.

From the psychoanalytic view, there may be at the same time &quot;transitions...to delusions&quot; from ideas of reference: &quot;abortive ideas of reference, in the beginning of their development or, in schizotypal personalities, continuously, may remain subject to the patient&#x27;s criticism...under adverse circumstances, by minimal economic shifts, however, reality testing may be lost and daydreams of this kind turn into delusions.&quot;

It has been noted that a person &quot;rigidly controlled by his superego...readily forms &quot;sensitive ideas of reference&quot;. A &quot;key experience&quot; may occur in his life circumstances and quite suddenly these ideas become structured as delusions of reference.&quot; Within the &quot;focus of paranoia...that man crossing his legs, that woman wearing that blouse—it can&#x27;t just be accidental. It has a particular meaning, is intended to convey something.&quot;

==Examples==

Persons with ideas of reference may experience:

* Believing that &quot;somehow everyone on a passing city bus is talking about them&quot;.
* Feeling that people on television or radio are either talking about them or talking directly to them.
* Believing that headlines or articles in newspapers have been written exclusively for them.
* Believing that events (even world events) have been deliberately contrived for them, or have special personal significance for them.
* Believing that the lyrics of a song are specifically about them.
* Believing that the normal function of cell phones, computers, and other electronic devices is to send secret and significant messages that only they can understand or believe. 
* Perceiving objects or events as having been deliberately set up to convey a particular meaning to themselves.
* Thinking &quot;that the slightest careless movement on the part of another person had great personal meaning...increased significance&quot;.
* Thinking that posts on social networking websites or Internet blogs have hidden meanings pertaining to them.
* Believing that the behavior of others is in reference to an abnormal, offensive body odor, which in reality is non-existent and cannot be smelled or detected by others (see: olfactory reference syndrome).

==Literary analogues==

* In &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; (1925), as a plane flies over a shell-shocked soldier: &quot;So, thought Septimus, they are signalling to me...smoke words&quot;. The author, Virginia Woolf, recorded in a memoir how she herself &quot;had lain in bed...thinking that the birds were singing Greek choruses and that King Edward was using the foulest possible language among Ozzie Dickinson&#x27;s azaleas&quot;.
* In Margaret Mahy&#x27;s &quot;Memory&quot; (1987), the confused adolescent hero decides &quot;to abandon himself to the magic of chance. From now on his signposts would be words overheard accidentally, graffiti, advertisements, street names...the clues the city offered him.&quot;
* The Naval Intelligence hero of Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;Treason&#x27;s Harbour&quot; (1983) reflects ruefully that &quot;after a while an intelligence-agent tended to see spies everywhere, rather as certain lunatics saw references to themselves in every newspaper.&quot;
* In Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s short story &quot;Signs and Symbols&quot; (1948), the parents of a suicidal youth suffering from a variation of this illness, &quot;referential mania&quot;, decide to remove him from a hospital in order to keep a more watchful eye.

<text>A raft is any flat structure for support or transportation over water. It is usually of basic design, characterized by the absence of a hull. Rafts are usually kept afloat by using any combination of buoyant materials such as wood, sealed barrels, or inflated air chambers (such as pontoons), and are typically not propelled by an engine. Rafts are an ancient mode of transport; naturally-occurring rafts such as entwined vegetation and pieces of wood have been used to traverse water since the dawn of humanity.

==Human-made rafts==

Traditional or primitive rafts were constructed of wood, bamboo or reeds; early buoyed or float rafts use inflated animal skins or sealed clay pots which are lashed together. Modern float rafts may also use pontoons, drums, or extruded polystyrene blocks. Depending on its use and size, it may have a superstructure, masts, or rudders.

Timber rafting is used by the logging industry for the transportation of logs, by tying them together into rafts and drifting or pulling them down a river. This method was very common up until the middle of the 20th century but is now used only rarely.
Large rafts made of balsa logs and using sails for navigation were important in maritime trade on the Pacific Ocean coast of South America from pre-Columbian times until the 19th century. Voyages were made to locations as far away as Mexico, and many trans-Pacific voyages using replicas of ancient rafts have been undertaken to demonstrate possible contacts between South America and Polynesia.

Rafts used for recreational rafting are almost exclusively inflatable rafts, manufactured of flexible materials such as PVC, hypalon, polyurethane, and nylon. These materials are resistant to the collisions and heavy wear the boats experience when traveling through whitewater. Whitewater rafts are also designed with high rocker, an raised bow and stern which allows them to pass over waves and obstacles more easily. Most have drain holes in the floor to prevent the boat from becoming swamped with water.

==Natural rafts==
In biology, particularly in island biogeography, non-manmade rafts are an important concept. Such rafts consist of matted clumps of vegetation that has been swept off the dry land by a storm, tsunami, tide, earthquake or similar event; in modern times they sometimes also incorporate other kind of flotsam and jetsam, e.g. plastic containers. They stay afloat by its natural buoyancy and can travel for hundreds, even thousands of miles and are ultimately destroyed by wave action and decomposition, or make landfall.

Rafting events are important means of oceanic dispersal for non-flying animals. For amphibians, reptiles, and small mammals, in particular, but for many invertebrates as well, such rafts of vegetation were often the only means by which they could reach and – if they were lucky – colonize oceanic islands before human-built vehicles provided another mode of transport.

<doc id="186234" wikidata="Q310765" url="?curid=186234" title="David Bohm">
<text>David Joseph Bohm (; 20 December 1917 – 27 October 1992) was an American scientist who has been described as one of the most significant theoretical physicists of the 20th century and who contributed unorthodox ideas to quantum theory, neuropsychology and the philosophy of mind. Among his many contributions to physics is his causal and deterministic interpretation of quantum theory known as De Broglie–Bohm theory.

Bohm advanced the view that quantum physics meant that the old Cartesian model of reality—that there are two kinds of substance, the mental and the physical, that somehow interact—was too limited. To complement it, he developed a mathematical and physical theory of &quot;implicate&quot; and &quot;explicate&quot; order. He also believed that the brain, at the cellular level, works according to the mathematics of some quantum effects, and postulated that thought is distributed and non-localised just as quantum entities are. Bohm&#x27;s main concern was with understanding the nature of reality in general and of consciousness in particular as a coherent whole, which according to Bohm is never static or complete.

Bohm warned of the dangers of rampant reason and technology, advocating instead the need for genuine supportive dialogue, which he claimed could bridge and unify conflicting and troublesome divisions in the social world. In this, his epistemology mirrored his ontology.

Born in the United States, Bohm obtained his Ph.D. under J. Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley. Due to his Communist affiliations, he was the subject of a federal government investigation in 1949, prompting him to leave the U.S. He pursued his career in several countries, becoming first a Brazilian and then a British citizen. He publicly distanced himself from Marxism during the controversy of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956.

== Youth and college ==
Bohm was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to a Hungarian Jewish immigrant father, Samuel Bohm, and a Lithuanian Jewish mother. He was raised mainly by his father, a furniture-store owner and assistant of the local rabbi. Despite being raised in a Jewish family, he became an agnostic in his teenage years. Bohm attended Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University), graduating in 1939, and then the California Institute of Technology, for one year. He then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he obtained his doctorate.

Bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of Oppenheimer&#x27;s other graduate students (Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz, Joseph Weinberg, and Max Friedman) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics. He was active in communist and communist-backed organizations, including the Young Communist League, the Campus Committee to Fight Conscription, and the Committee for Peace Mobilization. During his time at the Radiation Laboratory, Bohm was in a relationship with Betty Friedan and also helped to organize a local chapter of the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians, a small labor union affiliated to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).

== Work and doctorate ==

=== Manhattan Project contributions ===
During World War II, the Manhattan Project mobilized much of Berkeley&#x27;s physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb. Though Oppenheimer had asked Bohm to work with him at Los Alamos (the top-secret laboratory established in 1942 to design the atom bomb), the project&#x27;s director, Brigadier General Leslie Groves, would not approve Bohm&#x27;s security clearance after seeing evidence of his politics and his close friendship with Weinberg, who had been suspected of espionage.

During the war, Bohm remained at Berkeley, where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma, the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron. He completed his PhD in 1943 by an unusual circumstance. According to biographer F. David Peat, &quot;The scattering calculations (of collisions of protons and deuterons) that he had completed proved useful to the Manhattan Project and were immediately classified. Without security clearance, Bohm was denied access to his own work; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis, he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place!&quot; To satisfy the University, Oppenheimer certified that Bohm had successfully completed the research. Bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the Calutrons at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These calculations were used for the electromagnetic enrichment of uranium for the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.

=== McCarthyism and leaving the United States ===
After the war, Bohm became an assistant professor at Princeton University. He also worked closely with Albert Einstein at the nearby Institute for Advanced Study. In May 1949, the House Un-American Activities Committee called upon Bohm to testify because of his previous ties to unionism and suspected communists. Bohm invoked his Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify, and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues.

In 1950, Bohm was arrested for refusing to answer the committee&#x27;s questions. He was acquitted in May 1951, but Princeton had already suspended him. After his acquittal, Bohm&#x27;s colleagues sought to have him reinstated at Princeton, but Princeton President Harold W. Dodds decided not to renew Bohm&#x27;s contract. Although Einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the Institute, Oppenheimer (who had served as the Institute&#x27;s president since 1947) &quot;opposed the idea and [...] advised his former student to leave the country&quot;. His request to go to the University of Manchester received Einstein&#x27;s support but was unsuccessful. Bohm then left for Brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the University of São Paulo, at Jayme Tiomno&#x27;s invitation and on the recommendation of both Einstein and Oppenheimer.

=== Quantum theory and Bohm diffusion ===
During his early period, Bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics, particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory. As a postgraduate at Berkeley, he developed a theory of plasmas, discovering the electron phenomenon known as Bohm diffusion. His first book, &quot;Quantum Theory&quot;, published in 1951, was well received by Einstein, among others. But Bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book. Starting from the realization that the WKB approximation of quantum mechanics leads to deterministic equations and convinced that a mere approximation could not turn a probabilistic theory into a deterministic theory, he doubted the inevitability of the conventional approach to quantum mechanics.

Bohm&#x27;s aim was not to set out a deterministic, mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality, in contrast to the conventional approach. He began to develop his own interpretation (the De Broglie–Bohm theory, also called the pilot wave theory), the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory. He initially called his approach a hidden variable theory, but he later called it &quot;ontological theory&quot;, reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found. Bohm and his colleague Basil Hiley later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an &quot;interpretation in terms of hidden variables&quot; to be too restrictive, especially since their variables, position, and momentum &quot;are not actually hidden&quot;.

Bohm&#x27;s work and the EPR argument became the major factor motivating John Stewart Bell&#x27;s inequality, which rules out local hidden variable theories; the full consequences of Bell&#x27;s work are still being investigated.

=== Brazil ===
After Bohm&#x27;s arrival in Brazil on 10 October 1951, the US Consul in São Paulo confiscated his passport, informing him he could retrieve it only to return to his country, which reportedly frightened Bohm and significantly lowered his spirits, as he had hoped to travel to Europe. He applied for and received Brazilian citizenship, but by law, had to give up his US citizenship; he was able to reclaim it only decades later, in 1986, after pursuing a lawsuit.

At the University of São Paulo, Bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952. Jean-Pierre Vigier traveled to São Paulo, where he worked with Bohm for three months; Ralph Schiller, student of cosmologist Peter Bergmann, was his assistant for two years; he worked with Tiomno and Walther Schützer; and Mario Bunge stayed to work with him for one year. He was in contact with Brazilian physicists Mário Schenberg, Jean Meyer, Leite Lopes, and had discussions on occasion with visitors to Brazil, including Richard Feynman, Isidor Rabi, Léon Rosenfeld, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Herbert L. Anderson, Donald Kerst, Marcos Moshinsky, Alejandro Medina, and the former assistant to Heisenberg, Guido Beck, who encouraged him in his work and helped him to obtain funding. The Brazilian CNPq explicitly supported his work on the causal theory and funded several researchers around Bohm. His work with Vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and Louis De Broglie, in particular, on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by Madelung. 

Yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism, with many physicists holding the Copenhagen interpretation to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics. Bohm and Vigier both emphasized causality, not determinism. In this context, Bohm proposed a causal approach in which the material world could be represented at an infinite number of levels, with stochastic dynamics at every level.

From 1951 to 1953, Bohm and David Pines published the articles in which they introduced the random phase approximation and proposed the plasmon.

=== Bohm and Aharonov form of the EPR paradox ===
In 1955, Bohm relocated to Israel, where he spent two years working at the Technion, at Haifa. There, he met Sarah Woolfson, whom he married in 1956. In 1957, Bohm and his student Yakir Aharonov published a new version of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox, reformulating the original argument in terms of spin. It was that form of the EPR paradox that was discussed by John Stewart Bell in his famous paper of 1964.

=== Aharonov–Bohm effect ===
In 1957, Bohm relocated to the United Kingdom as a research fellow at the University of Bristol. In 1959, Bohm and Aharonov discovered the Aharonov–Bohm effect, showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded, but its vector potential did not vanish there. That showed for the first time that the magnetic vector potential, hitherto a mathematical convenience, could have real physical (quantum) effects.

In 1961, Bohm was made professor of theoretical physics at the University of London&#x27;s Birkbeck College, becoming emeritus in 1987. His collected papers are stored there.

=== Implicate and explicate order ===

At Birkbeck College, much of the work of Bohm and Basil Hiley expanded on the notion of implicate, explicate, and generative orders proposed by Bohm. In the view of Bohm and Hiley, &quot;things, such as particles, objects, and indeed subjects&quot; exist as &quot;semi-autonomous quasi-local features&quot; of an underlying activity. Such features can be considered to be independent only up to a certain level of approximation in which certain criteria are fulfilled. In that picture, the classical limit for quantum phenomena, in terms of a condition that the action function is not much greater than the Planck constant, indicates one such criterion. They used the word &quot;holomovement&quot; for the activity in such orders.

=== Holonomic model of the brain ===
In collaboration with Stanford University neuroscientist Karl H. Pribram, Bohm was involved in the early development of the holonomic model of the functioning of the brain, a model for human cognition that is drastically different from conventionally-accepted ideas. Bohm worked with Pribram on the theory that the brain operates in a manner that is similar to a hologram, in accordance with quantum mathematical principles and the characteristics of wave patterns.

=== Consciousness and thought ===
In addition to his scientific work, Bohm was deeply interested in exploring the nature of consciousness, with particular attention to the role of thought as it relates to attention, motivation, and conflict in the individual and in society. Those concerns were a natural extension of his earlier interest in Marxist ideology and Hegelian philosophy. His views were brought into sharper focus through extensive interactions with the philosopher, speaker, and writer Jiddu Krishnamurti, beginning in 1961. Their collaboration lasted a quarter of a century, and their recorded dialogues were published in several volumes.

Bohm&#x27;s prolonged involvement with the philosophy of Krishnamurti was regarded somewhat skeptically by some of his scientific peers. An examination in 2017 of the relationship between the two men presents it in a more positive light and shows that Bohm&#x27;s work in the psychological field was complementary to and compatible with his contributions to theoretical physics.

The mature expression of Bohm&#x27;s views in the psychological field was presented in a seminar conducted in 1990 at the Oak Grove School, founded by Krishnamurti in Ojai, California. It was one of a series of seminars held by Bohm at Oak Grove School, and it was published as &quot;Thought as a System&quot;. In the seminar, Bohm described the pervasive influence of thought throughout society, including the many erroneous assumptions about the nature of thought and its effects in daily life.

In the seminar, Bohm develops several interrelated themes. He points out that thought is the ubiquitous tool that is used to solve every kind of problem: personal, social, scientific, and so on. Yet thought, he maintains, is also inadvertently the source of many of those problems. He recognizes and acknowledges the irony of the situation: it is as if one gets sick by going to the doctor.

Bohm maintains that thought is a system, in the sense that it is an interconnected network of concepts, ideas and assumptions that pass seamlessly between individuals and throughout society. If there is a fault in the functioning of thought, therefore, it must be a systemic fault, which infects the entire network. The thought that is brought to bear to resolve any given problem, therefore, is susceptible to the same flaw that created the problem it is trying to solve.

Thought proceeds as if it is merely reporting objectively, but in fact, it is often coloring and distorting perception in unexpected ways. What is required in order to correct the distortions introduced by thought, according to Bohm, is a form of proprioception, or self-awareness. Neural receptors throughout the body inform us directly of our physical position and movement, but there is no corresponding awareness of the activity of thought. Such an awareness would represent psychological proprioception and would enable the possibility of perceiving and correcting the unintended consequences of the thinking process.

=== Further interests ===
In his book &quot;On Creativity&quot;, quoting Alfred Korzybski, the Polish-American who developed the field of General Semantics, Bohm expressed the view that &quot;metaphysics is an expression of a world view&quot; and is &quot;thus to be regarded as an art form, resembling poetry in some ways and mathematics in others, rather than as an attempt to say something true about reality as a whole&quot;.

Bohm was keenly aware of various ideas outside the scientific mainstream. In his book &quot;Science, Order and Creativity&quot;, Bohm referred to the views of various biologists on the evolution of the species, including Rupert Sheldrake. He also knew the ideas of Wilhelm Reich.

Contrary to many other scientists, Bohm did not exclude the paranormal out of hand. Bohm temporarily even held Uri Geller&#x27;s bending of keys and spoons to be possible, prompting warning remarks by his colleague Basil Hiley that it might undermine the scientific credibility of their work in physics. Martin Gardner reported this in a &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; article and also critiqued the views of Jiddu Krishnamurti, with whom Bohm had met in 1959 and had had many subsequent exchanges. Gardner said that Bohm&#x27;s view of the interconnectedness of mind and matter (on one occasion, Bohm summarized: &quot;Even the electron is informed with a certain level of mind.&quot;) &quot;flirted with panpsychism&quot;.

=== Bohm dialogue ===
To address societal problems during his later years, Bohm wrote a proposal for a solution that has become known as &quot;Bohm Dialogue&quot;, in which equal status and &quot;free space&quot; form the most important prerequisites of communication and the appreciation of differing personal beliefs. An essential ingredient in this form of dialogue is that participants &quot;suspend&quot; immediate action or judgment and give themselves and each other the opportunity to become aware of the thought process itself. Bohm suggested that if the &quot;dialogue groups&quot; were experienced on a sufficiently-wide scale, they could help overcome the isolation and fragmentation that Bohm observed in society.

== Later life ==
Bohm continued his work in quantum physics after his retirement, in 1987. His final work, the posthumously published &quot;The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory&quot; (1993), resulted from a decades-long collaboration with Basil Hiley. He also spoke to audiences across Europe and North America on the importance of dialogue as a form of sociotherapy, a concept he borrowed from London psychiatrist and practitioner of Group Analysis Patrick de Maré, and he had a series of meetings with the Dalai Lama. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1990.

Near the end of his life, Bohm began to experience a recurrence of the depression that he had suffered earlier in life. He was admitted to the Maudsley Hospital in South London on 10 May 1991. His condition worsened and it was decided that the only treatment that might help him was electroconvulsive therapy. Bohm&#x27;s wife consulted psychiatrist David Shainberg, Bohm&#x27;s longtime friend and collaborator, who agreed that electroconvulsive treatments were probably his only option. Bohm showed improvement from the treatments and was released on 29 August, but his depression returned and was treated with medication.

Bohm died after suffering a heart attack in Hendon, London, on 27 October 1992, aged 74.

The film &quot;Infinite Potential&quot; is based on Bohm&#x27;s life and studies; it adopts the same name as the biography by F. David Peat.

== Reception of causal theory ==
In the early 1950s, Bohm&#x27;s causal quantum theory of hidden variables was mostly negatively received, with a widespread tendency among physicists to systematically ignore both Bohm personally and his ideas. There was a significant revival of interest in Bohm&#x27;s ideas in the late 1950s and the early 1960s; the Ninth Symposium of the Colston Research Society in Bristol in 1957 was a key turning point toward greater tolerance of his ideas.

<text>In the context of physical geography, the [[Intermontane]] Plateaus is one of eight physiographic regions of the contiguous United States. The region consists mostly of plateaus and mountain ranges lying between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Mountains on the west. It is subdivided into three physiographic provinces: the Columbia Plateau in the north, the Basin and Range Province in the central and southwestern portions, and the Colorado Plateau in the southeast. In turn, each of these provinces are each subdivided into a number of physiographic sections.

==Physiographic provinces==

===Columbia Plateau Province===

The Columbia Plateau Province is a large igneous province of flood basalts erupted in Miocene and early Pliocence epochs across the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, and California.

===Colorado Plattiary erosion landforms===
The province was uplifted and divided into great blocks by faults or monoclinal flexures which were exposed to long-lasting denudation in a mid-Tertiary cycle of erosion. They were then broadly elevated again with renewed movement on some of the faults. The current erosion cycle started in the late Tertiary, when the deep canyons of the region were trenched. The results of the first cycle of erosion are seen in the widespread exposure of the resistant Carboniferous limestone as a broad platform in the southwestern area of greater uplift through central Arizona where the less resistant overlying formations have been eroded away. They are also seen in the development of a series of cuestas: huge, south-facing, retreating escarpments of irregular outline on the edges of the higher formations farther north. Each escarpment stands forth where a resistant formation overlies a weaker, less resistant one. Each escarpment is separated from the next higher one by a broad step of weaker strata.

A series of these geologic formations occurs in southern Utah, where in passing northward from the Carboniferous platform one ascends in succession the Chocolate Cliffs (Triassic sandstones), Vermilion and White Cliffs (Jurassic sandstones), the Gray Cliffs (Cretaceous sandstones, of remarkably cross-bedded structure, interpreted as the dunes of an ancient desert), and finally the Pink Cliffs (Eocene strata of fluviatile and lacustrine origin) of the high, forested plateaus. Associated with these irregular escarpments are occasional rectilinear ridges, the work of extensive erosion on monoclinal structures. A good example of this is Echo Cliffs lying east of the Painted Desert. The Mogollon Rim escarpment is part of the transition zone between the Mogollon Plateau of the Colorado Plateau Province and the Sonoran Desert of the Basin and Range Province.

With the renewal of uplift by which the earlier cycle of erosion was interrupted and the present cycle introduced, inequalities of surface due to renewed faulting were again introduced. These still appear as cliffs, of more nearly rectilinear front than the retreating escarpments formed in the previous cycle. These cliffs are peculiar in gradually passing from one formation to another, and in having a height dependent on the displacement of the fault rather than on the structures in the fault face. They are already somewhat battered and dissected by erosion. The most important line of cliffs of this class is associated with the western and southern boundary of the Plateau Province where it was uplifted from the lower ground. The few rivers of the region must have reached the quiescence of old age in the earlier cycle, but were revived by uplift to a vigorous youth in the current cycle. It is to this newly introduced cycle of physiographic evolution that the deep canyons of the Plateau province are due. Thus the Virgin River, a northern tributary of the Colorado River, has cut a vertical slit, 1000 ft. deep, hardly wider at the top than at the bottom, in the heavy Triassic sandstones of southern Utah. However the most famous example is the Grand Canyon of Arizona, eroded by the Colorado river across the uplifted platform of Carboniferous limestone.

During the current cycle of erosion, several of the faults, whose scarps had been worn away in the previous cycle, have been brought to light again as topographic features by the removal of the weak strata along one side of the fault line, leaving the harder strata on the other side in relief. Such scarps are known as fault-line scarps, in distinction from the original fault scarps. They are peculiar in having their altitude dependent on the depth of revived erosion, instead of the amount of faulting, and they are sometimes topographically reversed, in that the revived scarp overlooks a lowland worn on a weak formation in the upheaved fault-block. Another consequence of revived erosion is seen in the occurrence of great landslides, where the removal of weak (Permian) clays has sapped the face of the Vermilion Cliffs, so that huge slices of the cliff face have slid down and forward , all shattered into a confused tumult of forms for a or more along the cliff base.

====Volcanic features====
Volcanic features occur in abundance in the Plateau province. Some of the high plateaus in the north are capped with remnants of heavy lava flows of early eruption. A group of large volcanoes occurs on the limestone platform south of the Grand Canyon, culminating in Mount San Francisco (Humphreys Peak) (, a moderately dissected cone, and associated with many more recent smaller cones and freshlooking lava flows. Mount Taylor in western New Mexico is of similar age, but here dissection seems to have advanced farther, probably because of the weaker nature of the underlying rocks. The dissection has resulted in removing the smaller cones and exposing many lava conduits or pipes in the form of volcanic necks or buttes. The Henry Mountains in southwestern Utah are peculiar in owing their relief to the doming or blistering up of the plateau strata by the underground intrusion of large bodies or cisterns (laccolites) of lava, now more or less exposed by erosion.

===Basin and Range Province===

The large Basin and Range Province is a basin and range topography resulting from crustal extension (extensional tectonics). It is located in all or parts of Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, California, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona in the Western United States; and Sonora, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and other states southwards to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in Mexico. It involves some novel problems in its description, especially in Southern California and central Mexico.

The province is characterized by numerous disconnected mountain ranges trending north and south, from in length, the higher ranges reaching altitudes of , separated by broad, intermontane desert plains or basins at altitudes varying from sea-level (or a little less) in the southwest, to farther inland. It is an arid region.

Many of the intermontane plains, occurring mostly in the north, appear to be heavily aggraded with mountain waste. Others, mostly in the south, are valleys also heavily aggraded by mountain erosion. The structure of the region previous to faulting was dependent on long antecedent processes of accumulation and deformation and the surface of the region then was dependent on the amount of erosion suffered in the prefaulting cycle.

When the region was broken into fault blocks and the blocks were uplifted and tilted, the back slope of each block was a part of the previously eroded surface and the face of the block was a surface of fracture. The present form of the higher blocks is more or less affected by erosion since faulting, while many of the lower blocks have been buried under the waste of the higher ones.

====Northern areas====
In the north, where dislocations have invaded the field of the horizontal Columbian lavas, as in southeastern Oregon and northeastern California, the blocks are monoclinal in structure as well as in attitude. Here, the amount of dissection is relatively moderate, for some of the fault faces are described as ravined but not yet deeply dissected. Hence these dislocations appear to be of recent date.

====Central areas====
In the Great Basin of western Utah and through most of Nevada, many of the blocks exhibit deformed structures involving folds and faults of relatively ancient (Jurassic) date. In fact so ancient that the mountains formed by the folding were worn down to the lowland stage of old age before the block-faulting occurred. When this old-mountain lowland was broken into blocks and the blocks were tilted, their attitude, but not their structure, was monoclinal.

In this new attitude, they have been so maturely re-dissected in the current new cycle of erosion as to have gained elaborately carved forms in which the initial form of the uplifted blocks can hardly be perceived. Some of them still retain along one side the highly significant feature of a relatively simple base-line, transecting hard and soft structures alike indicating the faulted margin of a tilted block.

Here the less uplifted blocks are now heavily aggraded with waste from the dissected ranges. The waste takes the form of huge alluvial fans, formed chiefly by occasional boulder-bearing floods from the mountains. Each fan heads in a ravine at the mountain base and becomes laterally confluent with adjacent fans as it stretches several miles forward with decreasing slope and increasing fineness of material.

====Southern areas====
In the upper southern part of the Basin and Range Province, in the Mojave Desert of California, and Sonoran Desert of southern California and Arizona (U.S.) and northern Sonora (Mexico) states, the ranges are well dissected and some of the intermontane depressions have rock floors with gentle, centripetal slopes. This area also has huge alluvial fans, with heads at canyons exiting the mountains, and laterally confluent with adjacent fans as they extend for miles with rather consistent slopes.

The Basin and Range Province extends southeast down into Chihuahua state in northeast Mexico, and far south along the Mexican Plateau to central Mexico at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt.

====Drainage basins====
Only a small part of the Basin and Range province is drained to the sea. A few intermont areas in the north-west part of the province have outlets westward via the Klamath River through the Cascade range. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers from the Sierra Nevada pass through the Central Valley and California Coast Ranges to San Francisco Bay. A few basins in the southeast have outlet by the Rio Grande to the Gulf of Mexico.

=====Colorado River watershed=====
A much larger but still narrow medial area is drained southwestward by the Colorado River to the head of the Gulf of California, where this large and very turbid river has formed the extensive Colorado River Delta, north of which the former head of the gulf is now cut off from the sea and laid bare by evaporation as a plain below sea-level.

It is in the Lower Colorado River Valley that an irrigation project, involving the diversion of some of the river water to the low plain of the Imperial Valley, led to disaster in 1904. The river flooded through a deliberately engineered breach of the Alamo Canal and flowed across the Imperial Valley plain into the Salton Sink, forming the Salton Sea. The endorheic Salton Sea remains, now supplied by subterranean flow from over-irrigated fields draining into the aquifer.

=====Seasonal streams—lakes=====
Many streams descend from the ravines only to wither away on the desert basin floors before uniting in a trunk river along the axis of a depression. Others succeed in
uniting in the winter season, when evaporation is much reduced, and then their trunk flows for several additional miles only to disappear by sinking (evaporating) farther on. A few of the large streams, such as the Mojave River, when in flood may spread out in a temporary shallow sheet on a dead level of clay, or playa, in a basin center, but the sheet of water vanishes in the warm season (dry lake) and the stream shrinks far up its course, the absolutely barren clay floor of the playa, impassable when wet, becomes firm enough for crossing when dry.

One of the southwestern basins, with its floor below sea-level, has a plain of salt in its center. A few of the basins are occupied by endorheic lakes without outlet, of which Great Salt Lake, in north-west Utah, is the largest. Other examples are Owens Lake and Mono Lake in California.

Several smaller lakes occur in the basins of western Nevada, immediately east of the Sierra Nevada. During Pleistocene times all these lacustrine basins were occupied by lakes of much greater depth and larger size. The outlines of the eastern Lake Bonneville and the western Lake Lahontan water bodies are well recorded by shore lines and deltas on the enclosing slopes, hundreds of feet above the present lake surfaces. The abandoned shore lines have yielded evidence of past climatic changes second in importance only to those of the Pleistocene glaciated areas. The duration of the Pleistocene lakes was brief as compared with the time since the dislocation of the faulted blocks, as is shown by the small dimensions of the lacustrine beaches compared to the great volume of the ravine-heading fans on which the beaches often lie.

==Intermediate Province==
The Intermediate Province is located in parts of Washington, Oregon and Idaho.

===Lava plains===
The lava plains of the Columbia River Basin are among the most extensive volcanic outpourings in the world. They cover over in southeastern Washington, eastern Oregon, and southwestern Idaho, and are known to be deep in some river gorges.

The lava completely buries the pre-existent land forms over most of its extent. Some of the flows are still so young as to preserve their scoriaceous surface. Here, the shore-line of the lava contours evenly around the spurs and enters, bay-like, into the valleys of the enclosing mountains, occasionally isolating an outlying mass. Other parts of the lava flood are much older and have been more or less deformed and eroded. Thus the uplifted, dislocated and dissected lava sheets of Yellowstone National Park in the Rocky Mountains on the east (at the headwaters of the Snake River) are associated with the older lavas of the Columbian plains.

====River canyons====
The Columbia River has entrenched itself in a canyon-like valley around the northern and Western side of the lava plains. The Snake River has cut a deeper canyon farther southeast where the plains are higher and has disclosed the many lava sheets which build up the plains, occasionally revealing a buried mountain in which the superposed river has cut an even narrower canyon. One of the most remarkable features of the Intermediate Province is seen in the temporary course taken by the Columbia River across the plains, while its canyon was obstructed by Pleistocene glaciers that came from the
Cascade Range on the northwest. The river followed the temporary course long enough to erode a deep gorge, known as Grande Coulee, along part of its length.

The lava plains are treeless and for the most part too dry for agriculture. However they support wildlife, and cattle and horses. Along parts of their eastern
border, where the rainfall is a little increased by the approach of the westerly winds to the Rocky Mountains, there is a belt of very deep, impalpably fine soil, supposed to be a dust deposit brought from the drier parts of the plains farther west.

<text>Ivan Stang (born Douglass St. Clair Smith; August 21, 1953) is an American writer, filmmaker and broadcaster, best known as the author and publisher of the first screed of the Church of the SubGenius. He is credited with founding the Church with friend Philo Drummond in 1979, though Stang himself denied this and claimed the organization was founded in 1953 by J. R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs.

Born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, he attended the St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas. Since the publication of the first SubGenius pamphlet in 1980, Stang has embarked on a worldwide crusade (spanning at least three continents) to promote the Church. In May 2006 he finished writing, editing and designing a new SubGenius book for Thunder&#x27;s Mouth Press, &quot;The SubGenius Psychlopaedia of Slack: The Bobliographon.&quot; He has appeared on several national radio and television shows, including &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; on MTV. Stang is an instructor on the faculty of the Maybe Logic Academy. Both he and J.R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs appear as characters in John Shirley&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Kamus of Kadizar: The Black Hole of Carcosa&quot;.

== SubGenius Foundation ==
Stang also founded the business entity of the Church, the SubGenius Foundation. The SubGenius Foundation was located in Dallas, Texas, for most of its existence, though Stang relocated to Cleveland Heights, Ohio in 1999. The SubGenius Foundation was based there from 1999 to 2017, and the syndicated show &quot;The Hour of Slack&quot; is produced partially at WCSB at Cleveland State University. His &quot;Rants&quot; are a regular feature at the Starwood Festival and WinterStar Symposium, both produced by the Association for Consciousness Exploration (ACE). The Church has collaborated with ACE on a number of projects, including CDs, DVDs and the Rant &#x27;n Rave events in Cleveland, Ohio. He was awarded Best Crack-Pot Preacher by the &quot;Cleveland Scene&quot; in 2000. Stang continues to promote the Church, and he is a prominent member of Cleveland&#x27;s underground pop culture scene. In 2017 the Foundation and Stang moved to Glen Rose, Texas.

== &quot;High Weirdness by Mail&quot; ==
In 1988, Stang compiled a book called &quot;High Weirdness by Mail — A Directory of the Fringe: Crackpots, Kooks &amp; True Visionaries&quot;. The book examined many non-mainstream or marginal cultural movements of the period, as well as providing contact information for those wishing to interact directly with people involved in these movements.

== Filmmaking ==
Stang is a &quot;filmmaker&quot; and an &quot;editor&quot;. In addition to creating several stop-motion short films with such titles as &quot;Reproduction Cycle Among Unicellular Life Forms Under the Rocks of Mars&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Visit the World of the Future,&quot; he also edited the 1989 feature-length VHS video spoof-documentary &quot;Arise!&quot; for the Church of the SubGenius, as well as providing narration and commentary for the 1999 documentary &quot;Grass.&quot; Commercial jobs have included a 60-second &quot;Art Break&quot; animated short for MTV, animation in a Devo music video, as well as writing and editing the feature-length documentaries &quot;China Run&quot; and &quot;The Cu-Chi Tunnels&quot;.

<text>Electropop is a popular music fusion genre combining elements of the electronic and pop styles. It has been described as a variant of synth-pop with emphasis on a hard electronic sound. The genre was developed in the 1980s and saw a revival of popularity and influence in the late 2000s. The genre is often confused with electro, which is sometimes called electro-pop but is a separate genre which incorporates funk and early hip hop.

==History==
===Early 1980s===

Depeche Mode&#x27;s composer Martin Gore said: &quot;For anyone of our generation involved in electronic music, Kraftwerk were the godfathers&quot;.

During the early 1980s, British artists such as Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, the Human League, Soft Cell, John Foxx and Visage helped pioneer a new synth-pop style that drew more heavily from electronic music and emphasized primary usage of synthesizers.

===21st century===

==== 2000s ====
Britney Spears&#x27; highly influential fifth studio album &quot;Blackout&quot; (2007) is credited for bringing the genre to mainstream prominence. The media in 2009 ran articles proclaiming a new era of different electropop stars, and indeed the times saw a rise in popularity of several electropop artists. In the Sound of 2009 poll of 130 music experts conducted for the BBC, ten of the top fifteen artists named were of the electropop genre. Lady Gaga had major commercial success from 2008 with her debut album &quot;The Fame&quot;. Music writer Simon Reynolds noted that &quot;Everything about Gaga came from electroclash, except the music, which wasn&#x27;t particularly 1980s&quot;. Singer Michael Angelakos of Passion Pit said in a 2009 interview that while playing electropop was not his intention, the limitations of dorm life made the genre more accessible.

In 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; quoted James Oldham—head of artists and repertoire at A&amp;M Records—as saying &quot;All A&amp;R departments have been saying to managers and lawyers: &#x27;Don&#x27;t give us any more bands because we&#x27;re not going to sign them and they&#x27;re not going to sell records.&#x27; So everything we&#x27;ve been put on to is electronic in nature.&quot;
==== 2010s ====
In the 2010s, electropop music saw an increase in its commercial popularity, owing to the success of artists such as Avicii, Lady Gaga, Calvin Harris, Kesha, Rihanna, and Zedd. One of the most commercially successful electropop artists that came out from the early 2010s has been singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding.

Goulding first became known in the United Kingdom thanks to her 2009 hit single, &quot;Starry Eyed&quot;, which was featured on her folktronica debut album &quot;Lights&quot;. Goulding&#x27;s debut was met with critical acclaim, with Goulding ending up winning the BBC Sound of 2010 and the Critics Choice Brit Award. Eventually, she became internationally known thanks to the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Lights&quot;, a pop song with electronic beats, which became an sleeper-hit. &quot;Anything Could Happen&quot;, the lead single of Goulding&#x27;s second album &quot;Halcyon&quot; marked a shift on the singer-songwriter particular blend of folk and electronica, and embracing her electronic sound with fusion of pop. Furthermore, its re-issue &quot;Halcyon Days&quot; cemented Goulding as one of the mostly widely recognised figures in electropop music, collaborating with several electronic acts and achieving mainstream attention. In 2015, after the release of Goulding third album &quot;Delirium&quot;, Carrie Battan for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; dubbed Goulding as &quot;the Pop star of E.D.M.&quot; After 2016, Goulding went on a five-year hiatus, but she kept releasing successful stand-alone singles. At the end of the 2010s, Goulding was named Artist of the Decade by the Variety Hitmakers Awards, and &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked her as one of the most successful artists of the 2010s decade.

Electropop acts that achieved either commercial or critical success during the 2010s include: Sofi Tukker, Lykke Li, Mura Masa, Empire of the Sun, CHVRCHES, AlunaGeorge, Icona Pop, Tove Lo, BROODS, Troye Sivan, Charli xcx, MØ, Florrie, BANKS, Bright Light Bright Light, Foxes, AURORA, Allie X, and Marina.

The Korean pop music scene has also become dominated and influenced by electropop, particularly with boy bands and girl groups such as Super Junior, SHINee, f(x) and Girls&#x27; Generation.

==== 2020s ====
Some contemporary artists that have been highlighted as part of the new decade of electropop music include: Slayyyter, Ayesha Erotica, Sigrid and Billie Eilish, with the latter earning critical praise and commercial success just at the ending of the last decade. Kenneth Womack for &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that Eilish had &quot;staked her claim as the reigning queen of electropop&quot; with her critical and commercial hit album &quot;When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?&quot;.

<doc id="186247" wikidata="Q868678" url="?curid=186247" title="Concert for George">
<text>The Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 29 November 2002 as a memorial to George Harrison on the first anniversary of his death. The event was organised by Harrison&#x27;s widow, Olivia, and his son, Dhani, and arranged under the musical direction of Eric Clapton. The profits from the event went to the Material World Charitable Foundation, an organisation founded by Harrison.

==Performances==
The concert opened with a traditional Sanskrit invocation, the &quot;Sarvesham&quot; chant, followed by Indian music starting with Anoushka Shankar, daughter of Ravi Shankar, playing &quot;Your Eyes&quot;. Next, Anoushka Shankar, Dhani Harrison, and Jeff Lynne performed &quot;The Inner Light&quot;, followed by a Ravi Shankar composition &quot;Arpan&quot; (Sanskrit for &#x27;to give&#x27;), specially written for the occasion.

Next, there was a comedy interlude with four of the surviving members of the Monty Python troupe (Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones along with Python contributor Neil Innes) performing &quot;Sit on My Face&quot;. Then, Michael Palin came out as an over-the-top announcer who eventually states that he only ever wanted to be a lumberjack. He was then joined by the Pythons, Innes, Carol Cleveland, Tom Hanks, and The Fred Tomlinson Singers to perform &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;.

The remainder of the concert featured &quot;George&#x27;s Band&quot; and included the surviving members of the Beatles (Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr), Harrison&#x27;s son Dhani Harrison, as well as musicians Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Billy Preston, Jools Holland, Albert Lee, Sam Brown, Gary Brooker, Joe Brown, Ray Cooper, Andy Fairweather-Low, Marc Mann, Dave Bronze, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner and several other musicians who had appeared on Harrison&#x27;s recordings over the years.

They played a selection of mostly Harrison&#x27;s songs, from both Beatles and post-Beatles eras, generally staying faithful to Harrison&#x27;s arrangements. Performances included Lynne on &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; and &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)&quot;; Clapton on &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;; Petty on &quot;I Need You&quot; and &quot;Taxman&quot;; Petty, Lynne, Dhani Harrison, and Keltner on &quot;Handle With Care&quot; (reuniting most of the surviving Traveling Wilburys except for Bob Dylan); Clapton and Preston on &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Pity&quot;; Starr on &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot;; McCartney on &quot;For You Blue&quot; and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;; McCartney and Clapton on &quot;Something&quot; (McCartney opening with a solo ukulele accompaniment that shifts into a full band version featuring Clapton); Clapton, McCartney, and Starr reuniting on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. Preston on &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;; and the group performance of &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;.

Joe Brown closed the show with a rendition of &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot; on ukulele, one of Harrison&#x27;s favourite instruments.

The event was filmed and a motion picture version, directed by David Leland and photographed by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Chris Menges, was released on DVD on 17 November 2003. A compact disc version was also released on the same date although the Monty Python and Sam Brown tracks were not included on the CD. A Blu-ray version was released by Rhino Records on 22 March 2011.

In 2018, to honour what would have been Harrison&#x27;s 75th birthday, the concert made its debut on streaming services, and was issued on a vinyl LP set for the first time.

&quot;Astute&quot; arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 11 April 1950 for a six-week training period with the Royal Canadian Navy ending on 1 July. &quot;Astute&quot; spent 21 months in 1955–56 based at Halifax as part of the Canadian submarine squadron, leaving Canada for the UK on 10 December 1956.

As a response to the Cuban Missile Crisis, &quot;Astute&quot; and sister ship , both part of the Halifax-based 6th Submarine Squadron, were deployed to the North-East of the Grand Banks to warn if Soviet submarines were to be sent across the Atlantic to Cuba.

<text>The Amphion&quot; class(also known as the&quot;A&quot; classand Acheron&quot; class) of British diesel-electric submarines were designed for use in the Pacific War. Only two were completed before the end of hostilities, but following modernisation in the 1950s, they continued to serve in the Royal Navy into the 1970s.

==Development and service==

The &quot;Amphion&quot; class were ordered by the British Admiralty in 1943, upon the realisation that the new Pacific theatre of war following the attack on Pearl Harbor needed a new type of submarine. They were originally designed to replace the S-class and T-class submarines, which were too slow and unable to dive deep enough to be suited to Pacific waters during World War II. They were essentially the same size as the T class, arranged for fast, simple construction and to utilize much of the materials and equipment set aside for the T boats. They had a high, flared bow for excellent sea performance and had effective air conditioning, essential for Far East submarine operations. They were operated by a crew of between 60 and 68.

Originally, 46 submarines were ordered, but only 18 were launched (10 by Vickers-Armstrong in Barrow-in-Furness) and 16 commissioned, the other two hulls being used for crush testing. The class was designed for quick construction, using an entirely welded hull which could be fabricated in sections, a technique new to Britain but standard for Nazi Germany&#x27;s U-boats. Each submarine took about 8 months from keel-laying to launching, compared with around 15 months for the earlier T class, but only two of the boats were completed before the end of the war: , launched in August 1944, and in January 1945; neither saw action.

The &quot;Amphion&quot; class was one of only two new British submarine designs produced during World War II, the other being the X-craft 4-man submarines. Wartime experience had shown that submarines had to operate further from the United Kingdom and with larger patrol areas than had been foreseen—in the Far East and Mediterranean for example—so the faster and slightly larger A class was designed to have a longer range than the T class, with accommodation suitable for longer missions.

After World War II various modifications were made to these Overseas Patrol Submarines, as they were known. A snort mast based on the &quot;schnorkel&quot; used by U-boats during the war, a radar which could be used from periscope depth, and a night periscope were added to the A- and surviving T-class submarines.

In response to the start of the Cold War in the early 1950s their target changed from surface ships to Soviet submarines. In January 1948 the primary operational function of the British submarine fleet was announced to be interception of Soviet submarines slipping out of their bases in Northern Russia, potentially to attack British and Allied merchant vessels. The following April Assistant Chief of Naval Staff Rear-Admiral Geoffrey Oliver circulated a paper in which he proposed that British submarines take a more offensive role, attacking Soviet submarines off the Northern Russian coast and mining the waters in the area. With the dramatically reduced surface fleet, he commented that this was one of the few methods the Royal Navy had for &quot;getting to the enemy on his home ground&quot;.

The A and T classes were refitted for their new role between 1955 and 1960 with a complete rebuild of the forward and after hull section, lengthening and streamlining of the upper decks and conning towers, removal of deck guns to improve underwater speed and noise, removal of external torpedo tubes, and greatly improved sonar. When was lost in 1951 all the &quot;Amphion&quot; class were briefly confined to port pending investigation into her loss.

During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation in the mid-1960s, some &quot;Amphion&quot;-class submarines were fitted with either a QF 4-inch Mk XXIII gun or a single 20mm autocannon to counter blockade running junks. They were the last British submarines to carry a deck gun.

The &quot;Amphion&quot; class served the Royal Navy for almost three decades as the backbone of the Royal Naval Submarine Service, and was gradually replaced with the &quot;Porpoise&quot; and patrol classes that began to be phased in during 1958. The last operational &quot;Amphion&quot;-class boat, , was decommissioned in 1974.

<text>HMS &quot;Astute&quot; is an operational nuclear-powered attack
submarine in the Royal Navy, the lead boat of her class.

&quot;Astute&quot; is the second submarine of the Royal Navy to be named after the characteristic of shrewdness and discernment—the first was the World War II-era . She was the largest attack submarine in Royal Navy history when commissioned in 2010.

==Design==
Built as a successor to the , &quot;Astute&quot; is 50% larger than the T-boats but has a smaller crew. The 7,400-tonne &quot;Astute&quot;″s nuclear reactor will not need to be refuelled during the vessel&#x27;s 25-year service. Since the submarine can purify water and air, she is able to circumnavigate the planet without resurfacing. The main limit is that the submarine can only carry three months&#x27; supply of food for 98 crew.

&quot;Astute&quot; has stowage for 38 weapons and was expected to typically carry both Spearfish heavy torpedoes and Tomahawk Block IV cruise missiles, the latter costing £870,000 each.

==Construction and launch==

&quot;Astute&quot; was ordered from GEC&#x27;s Marconi Marine (now BAE Systems Submarines) on 17 March 1997. She was laid down at BAE&#x27;s submarine facility in Barrow-in-Furness on 31 January 2001, 100 years to the day after the keel was laid down for the Royal Navy&#x27;s first submarine . She was the first submarine built in the UK since HMS &quot;Vengeance&quot; (launched in 1998).

&quot;Astute&quot; was launched on 8 June 2007 by the then Duchess of Cornwall, 43 months behind schedule. The launch attracted more than 10,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAE164/2007&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her builders BAE Systems described her as &quot;the largest and most able attack submarine that the Royal Navy has operated, with a performance to rival any in the world&quot;.

&quot;Astute&quot; left Barrow on 15 November 2009 and on 20 November 2009, arrived at her home port of HMNB Clyde at Faslane.

==Sea trials and commission==

On 16 February 2010 &quot;Astute&quot; left Faslane for sea trials and dived for the first time on 18 February 2010. HMS &quot;Astute&quot; was commissioned on 27 August 2010, when she was given her HMS prefix, in a ceremony watched over by her patron the Duchess of Cornwall. She was delivered to the Royal Navy on 18 July 2013 and at that time was reported to be, &quot;nearing the end of her sea trials.&quot; In reality, the Royal Navy declared &quot;Astute&quot; to be fully operational in May 2014, some 13 years after being laid down.

==Operational history==

===Aground on Skye===
On 22 October 2010, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that &quot;Astute&quot; had &quot;run into difficulties&quot; off the Isle of Skye while on trials, after eyewitnesses reported that she had run aground a few miles from the Skye Bridge. There were no reports of injuries. The captain of the vessel elected to wait for tugboat assistance rather than using the submarine&#x27;s own power to clear the stern from the obstruction, to minimise damage to the hull&#x27;s anechoic tiles. A Royal Navy spokesman said that the vessel had been grounded on silt and was re-floated at high tide. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency-chartered emergency tow vessel &quot;Anglian Prince&quot; was dispatched to the scene from Stornoway.

The submarine returned under her own power to Faslane, where the damage was described as minor. A service inquiry concluded that the main cause of the grounding was not following navigation procedures combined with the watch officer not appreciating the proximity of danger. On 27 October 2010, the Royal Navy announced that Commander Andy Coles had been relieved of his command of &quot;Astute&quot;. Commander Iain Breckenridge previously commanded the submarine , and the Navy announced in December 2010 that he would take command. &quot;Astute&quot; had to return to port for repairs on 11 December 2010, on her first day back at sea after the grounding incident, due to a problem with her steam plant.

===2011 fatal shooting===

On 8 April 2011, one naval officer was killed and another injured in a shooting on board &quot;Astute&quot; while berthed at Southampton Docks. Southampton City Council&#x27;s leader, chief executive, and mayor were on board at the time. During a changeover of armed guards, 22-year old Able Seaman Ryan Donovan opened fire with an SA80 assault rifle in the submarine&#x27;s control room, hitting two officers before being overpowered by Southampton Council&#x27;s leader Royston Smith (a former RAF flight engineer), and chief executive Alistair Neill.

In the 48 hours before going on guard duty, Donovan had drunk 20 pints of cider and lager, as well as cocktails and double vodkas, leaving him well beyond the drink-drive limit when on duty. Heavy drinking before duties was common practice amongst the crew. According to Smith:

Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux, &quot;Astute&quot;″s weapons engineering officer, was killed. Donovan was arrested by Hampshire Constabulary officers and was charged with the murder of Molyneux and the attempted murder of Petty Officer Christopher Brown, Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, and Lieutenant Commander Christopher Hodge. He admitted to the murder of Molyneux and three counts of attempted murder; he was sentenced at Winchester Court on 19 September 2011 to life imprisonment and must serve a minimum of 25 years.

On 23 March 2012, Ian Molyneux, Royston Smith, and Alistair Neill were awarded the George Medal for gallantry. Molyneux&#x27;s widow received the Elizabeth Cross in April 2013.

===Weapons trials===

Starting in late 2011, she began a 5-month stay at the US Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) in the Bahamas, in which she fired Spearfish torpedoes and Tomahawk missiles. &quot;Astute&quot; launched two Tomahawks, the first missile on 15 November 2011. They were the Royal Navy&#x27;s ninth and tenth Tomahawk flight tests.

In February 2012, &quot;Astute&quot; rendezvoused with the underwater in the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center for a series of war games. Present were the head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope and the head of the United States Navy, Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert. It was reported that &quot;Astute&quot; &quot;surpassed expectations&quot; and that the Americans were &quot;taken aback&quot; by &quot;Astute&quot;″s capabilities. &quot;Astute&quot; had been expected to conduct her first operational deployment in 2013.

===First of class issues===
In November 2012 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that there had been a serious leak that caused an emergency surfacing because a cap for a pipe was made of the wrong metal, even though the inventory claimed proper checks had been made, that there were problems with reactor monitoring instruments because the wrong grade of lead was used, and circuit boards had not been correctly fitted. The Ministry of Defence and BAE Systems confirmed the problems were being worked on. An MoD spokesman said &quot;It is normal for first of class trials to identify areas where modifications are required and these are then incorporated into later vessels of the class.&quot;

===Maiden deployment===
&quot;Astute&quot; departed Faslane on her maiden deployment at the beginning of 2014, spending eight months abroad. Her deployment included an attached dry deck shelter aft of the sail, possibly for an SBS troop deployment. &quot;Astute&quot; returned to Faslane in October 2014.

===Major capability upgrade, sea training and return to operations===
Following her return to Faslane, &quot;Astute&quot; began a two-year major capability upgrade and sea training period. Her training saw her working with a Canadian maritime patrol aircraft and a NATO submarine in a simulated war environment. Having successfully completed this, &quot;Astute&quot; was once again declared ready for operations.

In November 2018, &quot;Astute&quot; took part in anti-submarine warfare exercises alongside Type 23 frigate in an undisclosed Scottish loch.

<text>The &quot;Astute&quot; class is the latest class of nuclear-powered fleet submarines (SSNs) in service with the Royal Navy. The boats are being constructed by BAE Systems Submarines at Barrow-in-Furness. Seven boats will be constructed: the first of class, , was launched by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, in 2007, commissioned in 2010, and declared fully operational in May 2014. The &quot;Astute&quot; class is the replacement for the fleet submarines in Royal Navy service.

==Development==

===Batch 2 &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class===
The &quot;Astute&quot;-class programme began in February 1986 when the Ministry of Defence (MOD) launched a number of studies intended to determine the capabilities and requirements for the replacement of its &quot;Swiftsure&quot; and &quot;Trafalgar&quot;-class fleet submarines. These studies, called project SSN20, were conducted during the Cold War, when the Royal Navy maintained a strong emphasis on anti-submarine warfare to counter increasingly capable Soviet submarines. To match this growing threat, the studies concluded that project SSN20 should be a revolutionary design, with significantly enhanced nuclear propulsion and firepower, and a more sophisticated &quot;integrated sonar suite&quot; and combat systems. Similarly, the United States Navy, which was facing the same threats, went on to design and build the . The estimated costs of project SSN20, although great, were not considered a &quot;constraint&quot;.

However, by 1990 the Berlin Wall had fallen and the Cold War came to an end. Project SSN20 was promptly cancelled and a new set of design studies were started, this time, with &quot;cost control&quot; as a key objective. The &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class had been an evolved derivative of the preceding &quot;Swiftsure&quot; class, and in order to reduce cost and technical risk it was concluded that this new class of fleet submarine should &quot;build upon&quot; the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; design. This became known as the Batch 2 &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class (B2TC), with approval for the studies phase given in June 1991. While the philosophy behind B2TC was that of a modern and improved &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, early design concepts of B2TC were also heavily influenced by the then under construction , in particular its nuclear steam raising plant (NSRP).

===&quot;Astute&quot; programme===
Following two years of a studies phase on B2TC, the MOD issued a draft invitation to tender in October 1993 and a final invitation to tender in July 1994. The final invitation to tender involved a formal competition between GEC-Marconi/BMT Limited and VSEL/Rolls-Royce, with bids to be submitted in June 1995. GEC-Marconi and BMT had little experience with British submarine designs, whereas VSEL and Rolls-Royce were heavily involved in both British nuclear submarine design and construction.

During the assessment phase of the bids put forward by both teams, the MOD favoured the GEC-Marconi/BMT design on both cost and capability grounds. The bid put forward by VSEL/Rolls-Royce was less attractive and considered &quot;an expensive and dull design.&quot; In June 1995, VSEL was subject to a takeover by GEC-Marconi, and with it, the Barrow shipyard. In December of the same year, the MOD announced that GEC-Marconi was the preferred bidder. The bid put forward by GEC-Marconi included the innovative use of 3D CAD software and modular construction techniques. Although the MOD had awarded the contract to GEC-Marconi, partly due to its competitive cost, it was still considered too high for the MOD to sign off on. The MOD and GEC-Marconi negotiated on a new price for the contract, amounting to £2.4 billion for the first three &quot;Astute&quot; submarines, plus in-service support. The contract was signed on 14 March 1997, for what was now called the &quot;Astute&quot; programme, with a fixed maximum price, and any cost overruns being assumed by GEC-Marconi, the contractor.

Although B2TC was intended to be a modest improvement over the &quot;Trafalgar&quot; class, it was not to be the case for &quot;Astute&quot;. With the signing of the contract in March 1997, GEC-Marconi started work on developing a complete and comprehensive design for the &quot;Astute&quot; programme. Initial realisation was that the size of the Rolls-Royce PWR2 required a much larger boat (beam and length) and significantly improved acoustic quieting. A new understanding was reached between the MOD and GEC-Marconi that this would be an entirely new class, and far more complex than originally envisioned.

===Construction, cost overruns and delays===

In November 1999, British Aerospace purchased GEC-Marconi and created BAE Systems. At the time of the takeover, it had been approximately 20 years since the &quot;Vanguard&quot; class was designed, and the last of the boats had already been launched. The workforce at the Barrow shipyard had fallen from around 13,000 to 3,000. Key skills in design and engineering had been lost, predominantly through retirement or movement into other careers. This created significant delays and challenges in getting the &quot;Astute&quot; programme from design phase and into construction phase. Further delays and cost increases were also caused by the 3D CAD software, despite originally being touted as an innovative cost saving measure, by greatly reducing man-hours. However, one of the reasons for this was a lack of experienced designers able to use the software and its expanded tools.

Despite numerous difficulties, including incomplete design drawings, the first boat, &quot;Astute&quot;, was laid down on 31 January 2001. As planned, modular construction methods were used, with the boat being built in several ring-like modules, each up to several metres in length. These were welded together using specially designed high-strength steel, and then fitted out. From boat 2 onward however, vertical outfitting has been used, whereby the ring-like sections are &quot;stood up on their ends.&quot; This has better enabled the fitting of large and heavy equipment, and has also proved to be more efficient, with reportedly &quot;thousands of man-hours saved&quot;. The class is the first nuclear submarine to be designed entirely using 3D computer software.

By 2002 both BAE and the MOD recognised they had underestimated the technical challenges and costs of the programme. In August 2002 the programme was estimated to be over three years late and hundreds of millions of pounds over budget. BAE Systems issued a profit warning on 11 December 2002 as a result of the cost overruns and delays. BAE Systems and the MOD subsequently renegotiated the contract, with an understanding that the MOD had to share some of the financial risks. In December 2003 the contract modifications were signed, with the MOD agreeing to add another £430 million to the programme and BAE Systems assuming £250 million of the cost overruns. The MOD also enlisted the advice and expertise of General Dynamics Electric Boat through a U.S. Navy contract. Eventually, a General Dynamics Electric Boat employee became the Astute Project Director at Barrow.
Input from General Dynamics helped resolve many of the software issues associated with 3D CAD; General Dynamics was also responsible for the introduction of vertical outfitting and other construction techniques. Consequently, much rework was needed on &quot;Astute&quot; now that detailed designs were complete. On 8 June 2007 &quot;Astute&quot; was launched and boats 2 and 3 (&quot;Ambush&quot; and &quot;Artful&quot;) were at various stages of construction. A month previously, procurement for boat 4 (&quot;Audacious&quot;) had been agreed. Boats 5 and 6 (&quot;Anson&quot; and &quot;Agamemnon&quot;) were approved in March 2010. In June 2012 the order was placed for the manufacture of the nuclear reactor for boat 7 (&quot;Achilles&quot;), as well as production of the first nuclear reactor for the . A £1.4 billion order to construct &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was issued by the MOD to BAE Systems on 19 April 2017

In November 2009, a House of Commons Defence Select Committee found that delays due to technical and programme issues brought the &quot;Astute&quot; class to a position of being 57 months late and 53 per cent (or £1.35 billion) over-budget, with a forecast cost of £3.9 billion for the first three boats. The handover of boat 4, HMS &quot;Audacious&quot;, was delayed from 2019 to 2021 due to &quot;emergent technical issues&quot;. In February 2020, James Heappey, parliamentary under secretary of state for defence, confirmed that the in-service date for the final SSN, HMS &quot;Achilles&quot;, had slipped to 2026.

In 2023, as part of the joint planning within the AUKUS defence group, it was indicated that, from 2027, one Astute-class submarine would forward operate on rotation from HMAS Stirling in Western Australia.

===Programme cost summary===
===Replacement===

In September 2021, the Ministry of Defence announced a £170 million investment into design work for the successor to the &quot;Astute&quot;-class. This funding included two £85 million contracts, which were awarded to BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. In March 2023, it was announced that the submarine would be a joint project between the United Kingdom, Australia and the United States and would start to replace the &quot;Astute&quot;-class in the Royal Navy in the late 2030s.

==Characteristics==

===Weapons and systems===

The &quot;Astute&quot; class has stowage for 38 weapons and would typically carry a mix of Spearfish heavy torpedoes and Tomahawk Block IV cruise missiles, the latter costing £870,000 each. The Tomahawk missiles are capable of hitting a target to within a few metres, to a range of . In May 2022, the MOD announced that it would be upgrading these missiles to Block V standard from 2024, which boasts an extended range and modernised in-flight communication and target selection. The Astute Combat Management System is a new version of the Submarine Command System used on other classes of British submarine. The system receives data from the boat&#x27;s sensors and displays the results on command consoles. The submarines also have Atlas Hydrographic DESO 25 high-precision echosounders, two CM010 non-hull-penetrating optronic masts—in place of conventional periscopes—which carry thermal imaging and low-light TV and colour CCD TV sensors. The class also mounts a Successor IFF system.

For detecting enemy ships and submarines, the &quot;Astute&quot; class is equipped with the sophisticated Sonar 2076, an integrated passive/active search and attack sonar suite with bow, intercept, flank and towed arrays. BAE claims that the 2076 is the world&#x27;s best sonar system. All of the Astute-class submarines will be fitted with the advanced Common Combat System.

===Propulsion and general specifications===
The boats of the &quot;Astute&quot; class are powered by a Rolls-Royce PWR2 (Core H) (a pressurised water reactor) and fitted with a pump-jet propulsor. The PWR2 reactor, which was developed for the &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class ballistic missile submarines, has a 25-year lifespan without the need for refuelling. As a result, the new submarines are about 30 per cent larger than previous British fleet submarines, which were powered by smaller-diameter reactors. Like all Royal Navy submarines, the bridge fin of the &quot;Astute&quot;-class boats is specially reinforced to allow surfacing through ice caps. These submarines can also be fitted with a dry deck shelter, which allows special forces (e.g. SBS) to deploy whilst the submarine is submerged. More than 39,000 acoustic tiles mask the vessel&#x27;s sonar signature, part of acoustic qualities that give the &quot;Astute&quot; class over any other submarine previously operated by the Royal Navy.

A 2009 safety assessment by the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator concluded that PWR2 reactor safety was significantly short of good practice in two important areas: loss-of-coolant accident and control of submarine depth following emergency reactor shutdown. The regulator concluded that PWR2 was &quot;potentially vulnerable to a structural failure of the primary circuit&quot;, which is a failure mode with significant safety hazards to crew and the public. Operational procedures have been amended to minimise these risks.

&quot;Astute&quot; is the second Royal Navy submarine class, after the &quot;Vanguard&quot; class, to have a bunk for each member of the ship&#x27;s company, ending the practice of &#x27;hot bunking&#x27;, whereby two sailors on opposite watches shared the same bunk at different times. However, they have less mess-deck space than the s built 45 years earlier and a Defence Board audit recognised mistakes had been made on accommodation standards and quality of life issues. Since it is nuclear powered, the boat has theoretically unlimited endurance, though in practice it is limited to 90 days at sea based on food carried (including 18,000 sausages and 4,200 Weetabix) and crew endurance.

In 2012, during the joint exercise Fellowship, &quot;Astute&quot; performed simulated battles with the latest United States Navy , . Royal Navy Commander Iain Breckenridge was quoted, &quot;Our sonar is fantastic and I have never before experienced holding a submarine at the range we were holding USS &quot;New Mexico&quot;. The Americans were utterly taken aback, blown away with what they were seeing&quot;.

The &quot;Astute&quot; class are designed to achieve a top speed of , but it was reported in 2012 that this speed could not be reached in trials due to a mismatch between the reactor and the turbine. However, in January 2015, the National Audit Office confirmed that demonstration of the top speed requirement (or Key Performance Measure (KPM)) for the &quot;Astute&quot; class was successful.

==Incidents==
*On 22 October 2010, the Ministry of Defence confirmed that &quot;Astute&quot; had &quot;run into difficulties&quot; off the Isle of Skye while on trials, after eyewitnesses reported the submarine had run aground a few miles from the Skye Bridge. There were no reports of injuries.
*On 8 April 2011, whilst the submarine was docked at Southampton, Able Seaman Ryan Samuel Donavan, using an SA 80 rifle, shot and murdered Lt Cdr Ian Molyneux in the control room of &quot;Astute&quot;. He also attempted to murder Lt Cdr Christopher Hodge (who was shot through the body), PO Christopher Brown and CPO David McCoy. He fired six shots before being wrestled to the deck by visiting City Council Leader Royston Smith and Chief Executive Alistair Neill.
*On 20 July 2016, &quot;Ambush&quot; sustained damage to the top of her conning tower during a collision with a merchant ship while surfacing on an exercise in Gibraltarian waters. It was reported that no crew members were injured during the collision and that the submarine&#x27;s nuclear reactor section remained undamaged.

==Boats in the class==
The names &quot;Astute&quot;, &quot;Ambush&quot; and &quot;Artful&quot; were last given to submarines that entered service towards the end of World War II. &quot;Audacious&quot;, &quot;Anson&quot; and &quot;Agamemnon&quot; were all names used by battleships that served in the First or Second World Wars.

<doc id="186258" wikidata="Q183883" url="?curid=186258" title="The Catcher in the Rye">
<text>The Catcher in the Rye is a novel by American author J. D. Salinger that was partially published in serial form in 1945–46 before being novelized in 1951. Originally intended for adults, it is often read by adolescents for its themes of angst and alienation, and as a critique of superficiality in society. The novel also deals with themes of innocence, identity, belonging, loss, connection, sex, and depression. The main character, Holden Caulfield, has become an icon for teenage rebellion. Caulfield, nearly of age, gives his opinion on a wide variety of topics as he narrates his recent life events.

&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; has been translated widely. About one million copies are sold each year, with total sales of more than 65 million books. The novel was included on &quot;Time&quot;″s 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, and it was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2003, it was listed at number 15 on the BBC&#x27;s survey &quot;The Big Read&quot;.

==Plot==
Holden Caulfield recalls the events of a long weekend, shortly before the previous year&#x27;s Christmas. The story begins at Pencey Preparatory Academy, an elite boarding school in the fictional town of Aggerstown, Pennsylvania, where he has been expelled after failing all his classes, except English.

Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who is heading out on a date. He is distressed when he learns that Stradlater&#x27;s date is Jane Gallagher, with whom Holden has been infatuated. When Stradlater returns, hours later, he fails to appreciate the deeply personal composition Holden has written for him about the baseball glove of Holden&#x27;s late brother, Allie, who died from leukemia years earlier, and refuses to say whether he had sex with Jane. Enraged, Holden punches and insults him, but Stradlater easily wins the fight. Fed up with the &quot;phonies&quot; at Pencey Prep, Holden decides to catch a train to New York, planning to stay away from his home until Wednesday, when his parents will have received notification of his expulsion. 

Throughout the night, Holden has unpleasant encounters with a prostitute named Sunny, and her pimp, Maurice, who ends up in a physical altercation with Holden; a familiar date, Sally Hayes, who Holden invites to run away with him but is rejected; and an old classmate Carl Luce, who Holden unrelentingly questions about his sex life. Holden eventually gets drunk, awkwardly flirts with several adults, calls Sally again, and runs out of money. 

Nostalgic to see his younger sister Phoebe, Holden sneaks into his parents&#x27; apartment while they are out and wakes her. Though happy to see him, Phoebe quickly guesses he has been expelled and chastises him for his general aimlessness and disdain. When she asks if he cares about anything, Holden shares a fantasy (based on a mishearing of Robert Burns&#x27;s &quot;Comin&#x27; Through the Rye&quot;), in which he imagines himself saving children running through a field of rye by catching them before they fall off a nearby cliff. Phoebe points out that the actual poem says, &quot;when a body meet a body, comin&#x27; through the rye.&quot; Holden breaks down in tears, and his sister tries to console him.

As his parents return home, he slips out and visits his former English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who expresses concern that Holden is headed for &quot;a terrible fall&quot;. Mr. Antolini advises him to begin applying himself and provides him with a place to sleep. Holden awakens to find Mr. Antolini patting his head, which he interprets as a sexual advance. He leaves and spends the rest of the night in a train-waiting room at Grand Central Terminal, sinking deeper into despair. 

In the morning, having lost hope of ever finding meaningful connection in the city, he decides to head out West to live as a deaf-mute gas station attendant in a log cabin. He arranges to see Phoebe at lunchtime to explain his plan and say goodbye. When they meet up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she arrives with a suitcase and asks to go with him. Holden refuses, which upsets Phoebe. He tries to cheer her by allowing her to skip school at the Central Park Zoo, but she remains angry. They eventually reach the carousel, where they reconcile after he buys her a ticket. The sight of her riding the carousel fills him with happiness.

He alludes to encountering his parents that night and &quot;getting sick&quot; and being sent to a sanatorium in California near his older brother D.B mentioning that he will be attending another academy in September. The novel ends with Holden stating that he is reluctant to say more because talk of school has made him miss his former classmates.

==History==
Various older stories by Salinger contain characters similar to those in &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. While at Columbia University, Salinger wrote a short story called &quot;The Young Folks&quot; in Whit Burnett&#x27;s class; one character from this story has been described as a &quot;thinly penciled prototype of Sally Hayes&quot;. In November 1941 he sold the story &quot;Slight Rebellion off Madison&quot;, which featured Holden Caulfield, to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, but it was not published until December 21, 1946, due to World War II. The story &quot;I&#x27;m Crazy&quot;, which was published in the December 22, 1945 issue of &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, contained material that was later used in &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. In 1946, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; accepted a 90-page manuscript about Holden Caulfield for publication, but Salinger later withdrew it. The school Holden attends is Pencey Preparatory Academy, a boarding school in Pennsylvania that Salinger may have based on the Valley Forge Military Academy and College.

==Writing style==
&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is narrated in a subjective style from the point of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes; for example, as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm, minor events, such as picking up a book or looking at a table, unfold into discussions about experiences.

Critical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenage colloquial speech of the time. Words and phrases that appear frequently include:

* &quot;Flitty&quot; – homosexual
* &quot;Give her the time&quot; – sexual intercourse
* &quot;Necking&quot; – kissing, hugging, and caressing passionately
* &quot;Phony&quot; – people who are dishonest or fake about who they really are
* &quot;Prince&quot; – a fine, generous, helpful fellow (often used in sarcastic fashion)
* &quot;Rubbernecks&quot; – people who turn their heads to gaze in curiosity
* &quot;Snowing&quot; – deceiving, misleading, or winning over by glib talk, flattery, etc.

==Interpretations==
Bruce Brooks held that Holden&#x27;s attitude remains unchanged at story&#x27;s end, implying no maturation, thus differentiating the novel from young adult fiction.
In contrast, Louis Menand thought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that &quot;alienation is just a phase.&quot; While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden&#x27;s state, in between adolescence and adulthood. Holden is quick to become emotional. &quot;I felt sorry as hell for...&quot; is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, and he talks about the golden ring and how it&#x27;s good for kids to try to grab it.

Peter Beidler in his &quot;A Reader&#x27;s Companion to J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;&quot; identified the movie that the prostitute &quot;Sunny&quot; refers to. In chapter 13 she says that in the movie a boy who looked like Holden fell off a boat, and from this detail, Beidler deduced that the movie was &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937), with the boy played by child-actor Freddie Bartholomew.

Each Caulfield child has literary talent. D.B. writes screenplays in Hollywood; Holden also reveres D.B. for his writing skill (Holden&#x27;s own best subject), but he also despises Hollywood industry-based movies, considering them the ultimate in &quot;phony&quot; as the writer has no space for his own imagination and describes D.B.&#x27;s move to Hollywood to write for films as &quot;prostituting himself&quot;; Allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove; and Phoebe is a diarist.
This &quot;catcher in the rye&quot; is an analogy for Holden, who admires in children attributes that he often struggles to find in adults, like innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and generosity. Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes. Later, Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the &quot;catcher&quot; and the &quot;fallen&quot;; he gives her his hunting hat, the catcher&#x27;s symbol, and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher.

In their biography of Salinger, David Shields and Shane Salerno argue that: &quot;&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; can best be understood as a disguised war novel.&quot; Salinger witnessed the horrors of World War II, but rather than writing a combat novel, Salinger, according to Shields and Salerno, &quot;took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; has been consistently listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Shortly after its publication, in an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Nash K. Burger called it &quot;an unusually brilliant novel,&quot; while James Stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating Holden&#x27;s. George H. W. Bush called it a &quot;marvelous book,&quot; listing it among the books that inspired him. In June 2009, the BBC&#x27;s Finlo Rohrer wrote that, 58 years since publication, the book is still regarded &quot;as the defining work on what it is like to be a teenager.&quot; Adam Gopnik considers it one of the &quot;three perfect books&quot; in American literature, along with &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, and believes that &quot;no book has ever captured a city better than &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; captured New York in the fifties.&quot; In an appraisal of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; written after the death of J. D. Salinger, Jeff Pruchnic says the novel has retained its appeal for many generations. Pruchnic describes Holden as a &quot;teenage protagonist frozen midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come.&quot; Bill Gates said that &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is one of his favorite books, as has Aaron Sorkin.

Not all reception has been positive. The book has had its share of naysayers, including the longtime &quot;Washington Post&quot; book critic Jonathan Yardley, who, in 2004, wrote that the experience of rereading the novel after several decades proved to be &quot;a painful experience: The combination of Salinger&#x27;s prose and Caulfield&#x27;s narcissism produced effects comparable to mainlining castor oil.&quot; Yardley described the novel as among the worst popular books in the annals of American literature. &quot;Why,&quot; Yardley asked, &quot;do English teachers, whose responsibility is to teach good writing, repeatedly and reflexively require students to read a book as badly written as this one?&quot; According to Rohrer, many contemporary readers, as Yardley found, &quot;just cannot understand what the fuss is about... many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in. J. D. Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique. That is to say, he has done nothing.&quot; Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book, saying that it &quot;captures existential teenage angst&quot; and has a &quot;complex central character&quot; and &quot;accessible conversational style&quot;; while at the same time some readers may dislike the &quot;use of 1940s New York vernacular&quot; and the excessive &quot;whining&quot; of the &quot;self-obsessed character&quot;.

==Censorship in the United States==
In 1960, a teacher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was fired for assigning the novel in class. She was later reinstated. Between 1961 and 1982, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; was the most censored book in high schools and libraries in the United States. The book was briefly banned in the Issaquah, Washington, high schools in 1978 when three members of the School Board alleged the book was part of an &quot;overall communist plot&quot;. This ban did not last long, and the offended board members were immediately recalled and removed in a special election. In 1981, it was both the most censored book and the second most taught book in public schools in the United States. According to the American Library Association, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; was the 10th most frequently challenged book from 1990 to 1999. It was one of the ten most challenged books of 2005, and although it had been off the list for three years, it reappeared in the list of most challenged books of 2009.

The challenges generally begin with Holden&#x27;s frequent use of vulgar language; other reasons include sexual references, blasphemy, undermining of family values and moral codes, encouragement of rebellion, and promotion of drinking, smoking, lying, promiscuity, and sexual abuse. The book was written for an adult audience, which often forms the foundation of many challengers&#x27; arguments against it. Often the challengers have been unfamiliar with the plot itself. Shelley Keller-Gage, a high school teacher who faced objections after assigning the novel in her class, noted that &quot;the challengers are being just like Holden... They are trying to be catchers in the rye.&quot; Censorship of the book often causes a Streisand effect, as such incidents cause many to put themselves on the waiting list to borrow the novel, where there was no waiting list before.

==Violent reactions==

Several shootings have been associated with Salinger&#x27;s novel, including Robert John Bardo&#x27;s murder of Rebecca Schaeffer and John Hinckley Jr.&#x27;s assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan. Additionally, after fatally shooting John Lennon, Mark David Chapman was arrested with a copy of the book that he had purchased that same day, inside of which he had written: &quot;To Holden Caulfield, From Holden Caulfield, &quot;This&quot; is my statement&quot;.

Commenting on the fascination of Hinckley and Chapman, Harvey Solomon-Brady wrote:

==Attempted adaptations==

===In film===
Early in his career, Salinger expressed a willingness to have his work adapted for the screen. In 1949, a critically panned film version of his short story &quot;Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut&quot; was released; renamed &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, the film took great liberties with Salinger&#x27;s plot and is widely considered to be among the reasons that Salinger refused to allow any subsequent film adaptations of his work. The enduring success of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, however, has resulted in repeated attempts to secure the novel&#x27;s screen rights.

When &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; was first released, many offers were made to adapt it for the screen, including one from Samuel Goldwyn, producer of &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;. In a letter written in the early 1950s, Salinger spoke of mounting a play in which he would play the role of Holden Caulfield opposite Margaret O&#x27;Brien, and, if he couldn&#x27;t play the part himself, to &quot;forget about it.&quot; Almost 50 years later, the writer Joyce Maynard definitively concluded, &quot;The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J. D. Salinger.&quot;

Salinger told Maynard in the 1970s that Jerry Lewis &quot;tried for years to get his hands on the part of Holden,&quot; the protagonist in the novel which Lewis had not read until he was in his thirties. Film industry figures including Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Ralph Bakshi, Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio have tried to make a film adaptation. In an interview with &quot;Premiere&quot;, John Cusack commented that his one regret about turning 21 was that he had become too old to play Holden Caulfield. Writer-director Billy Wilder recounted his abortive attempts to snare the novel&#x27;s rights:

In 1961, Salinger denied Elia Kazan permission to direct a stage adaptation of &quot;Catcher&quot; for Broadway. Later, Salinger&#x27;s agents received bids for the &quot;Catcher&quot; film rights from Harvey Weinstein and Steven Spielberg, neither of which was even passed on to Salinger for consideration.

In 2003, the BBC television program &quot;The Big Read&quot; featured &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, interspersing discussions of the novel with &quot;a series of short films that featured an actor playing J. D. Salinger&#x27;s adolescent antihero, Holden Caulfield.&quot; The show defended its unlicensed adaptation of the novel by claiming to be a &quot;literary review&quot;, and no major charges were filed.

In 2008, the rights of Salinger&#x27;s works were placed in the JD Salinger Literary Trust where Salinger was the sole trustee. Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger&#x27;s agent at Harold Ober Associates in New York, declined to say who the trustees are now that the author is dead. After Salinger died in 2010, Westberg stated that nothing had changed in terms of licensing film, television, or stage rights of his works. A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; released after his death. He wrote: &quot;Firstly, it is possible that one day the rights will be sold. Since there&#x27;s an ever-looming possibility that I won&#x27;t die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won&#x27;t have to see the results of the transaction.&quot; Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield&#x27;s first-person narrative into voice-over and dialogue would be contrived.

In 2020, Don Hahn revealed that The Walt Disney Company had almost made an animated film titled &quot;Dufus&quot; which would have been an adaptation of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; &quot;with German shepherds&quot;, most likely akin to &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;. The idea came from then CEO Michael Eisner who loved the book and wanted to do an adaptation. After being told that J. D. Salinger would not agree to sell the film rights, Eisner stated, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s just do that kind of story, that kind of growing up, coming of age story.&quot;

===Banned fan sequel===
In 2009, the year before he died, Salinger successfully sued to stop the U.S. publication of a novel that presents Holden Caulfield as an old man. The novel&#x27;s author, Fredrik Colting, commented: &quot;call me an ignorant Swede, but the last thing I thought possible in the U.S. was that you banned books&quot;. The issue is complicated by the nature of Colting&#x27;s book, &quot;60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye&quot;, which has been compared to fan fiction. Although commonly not authorized by writers, no legal action is usually taken against fan fiction, since it is rarely published commercially and thus involves no profit.

<doc id="186259" wikidata="Q382984" url="?curid=186259" title="Dinitrogen tetroxide">
<text>Dinitrogen tetroxide, commonly referred to as nitrogen tetroxide (NTO), and occasionally (usually among ex-USSR/Russian rocket engineers) as amyl, is the chemical compound N2O4. It is a useful reagent in chemical synthesis. It forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide. Its molar mass is 92.011 g/mol.

Dinitrogen tetroxide is a powerful oxidizer that is hypergolic (spontaneously reacts) upon contact with various forms of hydrazine, which has made the pair a common bipropellant for rockets.

==Structure and properties==
Dinitrogen tetroxide could be regarded as two nitro groups (-NO2) bonded together. It forms an equilibrium mixture with nitrogen dioxide. The molecule is planar with an N-N bond distance of 1.78Å and N-O distances of 1.19Å. The N-N distance corresponds to a weak bond, since it is significantly longer than the average N-N single bond length of 1.45Å. This exceptionally weak σ bond (amounting to overlapping of the &quot;sp&quot;2 hybrid orbitals of the two NO2 units) results from the simultaneous delocalization of the bonding electron pair across the whole N2O4 molecule, and the considerable electrostatic repulsion of the doubly occupied molecular orbitals of each NO2 unit.

Unlike NO2, N2O4 is diamagnetic since it has no unpaired electrons. The liquid is also colorless but can appear as a brownish yellow liquid due to the presence of NO2 according to the following equilibrium:
: N2O4 ⇌ 2 NO2()

Higher temperatures push the equilibrium towards nitrogen dioxide. Inevitably, some dinitrogen tetroxide is a component of smog containing nitrogen dioxide.

Solid is white, and melts at −11.2 °C.

==Production==
Nitrogen tetroxide is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia (the Ostwald process): steam is used as a diluent to reduce the combustion temperature. In the first step, the ammonia is oxidized into nitric oxide:
: 4 NH3 + 5 O2 → 4 NO + 6 H2O

Most of the water is condensed out, and the gases are further cooled; the nitric oxide that was produced is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide, which is then dimerized into nitrogen tetroxide:
: 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2
: 2 NO2 ⇌ N2O4

and the remainder of the water is removed as nitric acid. The gas is essentially pure nitrogen dioxide, which is condensed into dinitrogen tetroxide in a brine-cooled liquefier.

Dinitrogen tetroxide can also be made through the reaction of concentrated nitric acid and metallic copper. This synthesis is practical in a laboratory setting. Dinitrogen tetroxide can also be produced by heating metal nitrates. The oxidation of copper by nitric acid is a complex reaction forming various nitrogen oxides of varying stability which depends on the concentration of the nitric acid, presence of oxygen, and other factors. The unstable species further react to form nitrogen dioxide which is then purified and condensed to form dinitrogen tetroxide.

==Use as a rocket propellant==
Nitrogen tetroxide is used as an oxidizing agent in one of the most important rocket propellant systems because it can be stored as a liquid at room temperature. Pedro Paulet, a Peruvian polymath, reported in 1927 that he had experimented in the 1890s with a rocket engine that used spring-loaded nozzles that periodically introduced vaporized nitrogen tetroxide and a petroleum benzine to a spark plug for ignition, with the engine putting out 300 pulsating explosions per minute. Paulet would go on to visit the German rocket association Verein für Raumschiffahrt (VfR) and on March 15, 1928, Valier applauded Paulet&#x27;s liquid-propelled rocket design in the VfR publication &quot;Die Rakete&quot;, saying the engine had &quot;amazing power&quot;. Paulet would soon be approached by Nazi Germany to help develop rocket technology, though he refused to assist and never shared the formula for his propellant.

In early 1944, research on the usability of dinitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizing agent for rocket fuel was conducted by German scientists, although the Germans only used it to a very limited extent as an additive for S-Stoff (fuming nitric acid). It became the storable oxidizer of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. It is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel. One of the earliest uses of this combination was on the Titan family of rockets used originally as ICBMs and then as launch vehicles for many spacecraft. Used on the U.S. Gemini and Apollo spacecraft and also on the Space Shuttle, it continues to be used as station-keeping propellant on most geo-stationary satellites, and many deep-space probes. It is also the primary oxidizer for Russia&#x27;s Proton rocket.

When used as a propellant, dinitrogen tetroxide is usually referred to simply as &quot;nitrogen tetroxide&quot; and the abbreviation &quot;NTO&quot; is extensively used. Additionally, NTO is often used with the addition of a small percentage of nitric oxide that reacts to form dinitrogen trioxide, which inhibits stress-corrosion cracking of titanium alloys, and in this form, propellant-grade NTO is referred to as &quot;mixed oxides of nitrogen&quot; (&quot;MON&quot;) and can be distinguished by its green-blue color. Larger additions of nitric oxide, up to 25-30%, also lower the freezing point of NTO, improving storability in space conditions. Most spacecraft now use MON instead of NTO; for example, the Space Shuttle reaction control system used MON3 (NTO containing 3% NO by weight).

===The Apollo-Soyuz mishap===
On 24 July 1975, NTO poisoning affected three U.S. astronauts on the final descent to Earth after the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight. This was due to a switch accidentally left in the wrong position, which allowed the attitude control thrusters to fire after the cabin fresh air intake was opened, allowing NTO fumes to enter the cabin. One crew member lost consciousness during descent. Upon landing, the crew was hospitalized for five days for chemical-induced pneumonia and pulmonary edema.

==Power generation using N2O4==
The tendency of N2O4 to reversibly break into NO2 has led to research into its use in advanced power generation systems as a so-called dissociating gas. &quot;Cool&quot; dinitrogen tetroxide is compressed and heated, causing it to dissociate into nitrogen dioxide at half the molecular weight. This hot nitrogen dioxide is expanded through a turbine, cooling it and lowering the pressure, and then cooled further in a heat sink, causing it to recombine into nitrogen tetroxide at the original molecular weight. It is then much easier to compress to start the entire cycle again. Such dissociative gas Brayton cycles have the potential to considerably increase efficiencies of power conversion equipment.

The high molecular weight and smaller volumetric expansion ratio of nitrogen dioxide compared to steam allows the turbines to be more compact.

N2O4 was the main component of the &quot;nitrin&quot; working fluid in the decommissioned Pamir-630D portable nuclear reactor which operated from 1985 to 1987.

==Chemical reactions==

===Intermediate in the manufacture of nitric acid===
Nitric acid is manufactured on a large scale via N2O4. This species reacts with water to give both nitrous acid and nitric acid:
: N2O4 + H2O → HNO2 + HNO3

The coproduct HNO2 upon heating disproportionates to NO and more nitric acid. When exposed to oxygen, NO is converted back into nitrogen dioxide:
: 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2

The resulting NO2 and N2O4 can be returned to the cycle to give the mixture of nitrous and nitric acids again.

===Synthesis of metal nitrates===
N2O4 undergoes molecular autoionization to give [NO+] [NO3−], with the former nitrosonium ion being a strong oxidant. Various anhydrous transition metal nitrate complexes can be prepared from N2O4 and base metal.

: 2 N2O4 + M → 2 NO + M(NO3)2

where M = Cu, Zn, or Sn.

If metal nitrates are prepared from N2O4 in completely anhydrous conditions, a range of covalent metal nitrates can be formed with many transition metals. This is because there is a thermodynamic preference for the nitrate ion to bond covalently with such metals rather than form an ionic structure. Such compounds must be prepared in anhydrous conditions, since the nitrate ion is a much weaker ligand than water, and if water is present the simple nitrate of the hydrated metal ion will form. The anhydrous nitrates concerned are themselves covalent, and many, e.g. anhydrous copper nitrate, are volatile at room temperature. Anhydrous titanium nitrate sublimes in vacuum at only 40 °C. Many of the anhydrous transition metal nitrates have striking colours. This branch of chemistry was developed by Cliff Addison and Norman Logan at the University of Nottingham in the UK during the 1960s and 1970s when highly efficient desiccants and dry boxes started to become available.

===With organic compounds===
In even slightly basic solvents, N2O4 adds to alkenes radically, giving mixtures of nitro compounds and nitrite esters. Pure or in entirely nonbasic solvents, the compounds autoionizes as above, to give nitroso compounds and nitrate esters.

<text>Omari Ishmael Grandberry (born November 12, 1984), better known by his stage name Omarion, is an American R&amp;B singer, dancer and actor. He rose to prominence as lead vocalist of the boy band B2K, which was formed in 1998 and managed by record executive Chris Stokes. The group achieved success in the early 2000s with their singles &quot;Gots ta Be&quot;, &quot;Uh Huh&quot;, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one hit &quot;Bump, Bump, Bump&quot; (featuring P. Diddy).

After the group&#x27;s 2004 disbandment, Omarion promptly embarked on a solo career. He signed with Epic Records to release his first two studio albums, &quot;O&quot; (2005) and &quot;21&quot; (2006), both of which debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The former was led by the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top 40 single &quot;O&quot; and was nominated for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, while the latter spawned the single &quot;Ice Box&quot;, which remains his highest-charting song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 12.

==Life and career==
===1984–1998: Early life and career beginnings===
Omarion was born Omari Ishmael Grandberry on November 12, 1984, in Inglewood, California to Leslie Burrell and Trent Grandberry. His younger brother, O&#x27;Ryan, is also a singer. He appeared in commercials for both Kellogg&#x27;s Corn Pops and McDonald&#x27;s. He started his dancing career as a background dancer for the R&amp;B girl group Before Dark and appeared in their music videos. Omarion soon began pursuing a career in music, and would go on to become the lead singer of the boy band B2K.

===1998–2004: B2K===

Omari joined the group B2K in 1998 and took the stage name Omarion. The group named themselves B2K, an acronym for &quot;Boys of The New Millennium&quot;. They began touring with Lil Bow Wow and eventually released their debut single, &quot;Uh Huh&quot;, in 2001. They soon after released their debut album, the self-titled &quot;B2K&quot;, on March 12, 2002. The album peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop albums chart. They followed the album up in December with their second album, &quot;Pandemonium!&quot;, supported by their most successful single, &quot;Bump, Bump, Bump&quot; featuring P. Diddy. The single peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This would prove to be the group&#x27;s last album, as they would disband in early 2004.

===2004–2008: &quot;O&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, and &quot;Face Off&quot;===
In early 2004, Omarion appeared in several films, most notably &quot;You Got Served&quot;, in which he starred alongside Marques Houston, as well as his former B2K bandmates. The movie centered on a group of friends in a hip hop dance crew who take part in underground dance competitions. That same year, he played the role of the school bully &quot;Reggie&quot; in the comedy &quot;Fat Albert,&quot; based on the animated series &quot;Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.&quot; On February 22, 2005, Omarion released his debut solo album, &quot;O&quot;. The album debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. The first single from the album was &quot;O&quot;. The single peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The second single, &quot;Touch&quot;, peaked at No. 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album received a third and final release with &quot;I&#x27;m Tryna&quot;. &quot;O&quot; has sold over 758,000 copies in the United States since its release. Omarion received a Grammy nomination for the album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album. On December 26, 2006, Omarion released his second album, &quot;21&quot;. The album debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. The first single from the album was &quot;Entourage&quot;. The second single, &quot;Ice Box&quot;, produced by Timbaland, peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and is Omarion&#x27;s most successful solo single to date, reaching gold certification by the RIAA. &quot;21&quot; has sold over 390,000 copies in the United States since its release.

Towards the end of 2007, he displayed his acting skills in the thriller &quot;Somebody Help Me.&quot; This movie was released exclusively on DVD and aired on BET in celebration of Halloween. Omarion has also made several appearances in a number of TV shows, including &quot;One on One&quot;. Omarion also played the voice of Fifteen Cent in &quot;The Proud Family Movie.&quot; His portrayal of a rapper who gets involved with thugs in the movie &quot;Feel the Noise&quot;, which he co-produced, received mixed reviews from critics. In late 2007, Omarion and Bow Wow recorded a collaboration album titled &quot;Face Off&quot;. The album sold over 100,000 copies in its first week and went on to sell over 500,000 copies, reaching gold certification by the RIAA. The first single from the album was &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, followed up by &quot;Hey Baby&quot; as the second single.

<text>A Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, or BZ reaction, is one of a class of reactions that serve as a classical example of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, resulting in the establishment of a nonlinear chemical oscillator. The only common element in these oscillators is the inclusion of bromine and an acid. The reactions are important to theoretical chemistry in that they show that chemical reactions do not have to be dominated by equilibrium thermodynamic behavior. These reactions are far from equilibrium and remain so for a significant length of time and evolve chaotically. In this sense, they provide an interesting chemical model of nonequilibrium biological phenomena; as such, mathematical models and simulations of the BZ reactions themselves are of theoretical interest, showing phenomenon as noise-induced order.

An essential aspect of the BZ reaction is its so called &quot;excitability&quot;; under the influence of stimuli, patterns develop in what would otherwise be a perfectly quiescent medium. Some clock reactions such as Briggs–Rauscher and BZ using tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride as catalyst can be excited into self-organising activity through the influence of light.

== History ==

The discovery of the phenomenon is credited to Boris Belousov. In 1951, while trying to find the non-organic analog to the Krebs cycle, he noted that in a mix of potassium bromate, cerium(IV) sulfate, malonic acid, and citric acid in dilute sulfuric acid, the ratio of concentration of the cerium(IV) and cerium(III) ions oscillated, causing the colour of the solution to oscillate between a yellow solution and a colorless solution. This is due to the cerium(IV) ions being reduced by malonic acid to cerium(III) ions, which are then oxidized back to cerium(IV) ions by bromate(V) ions.

Belousov made two attempts to publish his finding, but was rejected on the grounds that he could not explain his results to the satisfaction of the editors of the journals to which he submitted his results. Soviet biochemist Simon El&#x27;evich Shnoll encouraged Belousov to continue his efforts to publish his results. In 1959 his work was finally published in a less respectable, nonreviewed journal.

After Belousov&#x27;s publication, Shnoll gave the project in 1961 to a graduate student, Anatol Zhabotinsky, who investigated the reaction sequence in detail; however, the results of these men&#x27;s work were still not widely disseminated, and were not known in the West until a conference in Prague in 1968.

A number of BZ cocktails are available in the chemical literature and on the web. Ferroin, a complex of phenanthroline and iron, is a common indicator. These reactions, if carried out in petri dishes, result in the formation first of colored spots. These spots grow into a series of expanding concentric rings or perhaps expanding spirals similar to the patterns generated by a cyclic cellular automaton. The colors disappear if the dishes are shaken, and then reappear. The waves continue until the reagents are consumed. The reaction can also be performed in a beaker using a magnetic stirrer.

Andrew Adamatzky, a computer scientist in the University of the West of England, reported on liquid logic gates using the BZ reaction. The BZ reaction has also been used by Juan Pérez-Mercader and his group at Harvard University to create an entirely chemical Turing machine, capable of recognizing a Chomsky type-1 language.

Strikingly similar oscillatory spiral patterns appear elsewhere in nature, at very different spatial and temporal scales, for example the growth pattern of &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;, a soil-dwelling amoeba colony. In the BZ reaction, the size of the interacting elements is molecular and the time scale of the reaction is minutes. In the case of the soil amoeba, the size of the elements is typical of single-celled organisms and the times involved are on the order of days to years.

Investigators are also exploring the creation of a &quot;wet computer&quot;, using self-creating &quot;cells&quot; and other techniques to mimic certain properties of neurons.

==Chemical mechanism==
The mechanism for this reaction is very complex and is thought to involve around 18 different steps which have been the subject of a number of research papers.

In a way similar to the Briggs–Rauscher reaction, two key processes (both of which are auto-catalytic) occur; process A generates molecular bromine, giving the red colour, and process B consumes the bromine to give bromide ions. Theoretically, the reaction resembles the ideal Turing pattern, a system that emerges qualitatively from solving the reaction diffusion equations for a reaction that generates both a reaction inhibitor and a reaction promoter, of which the two diffuse across the medium at different rates.

One of the most common variations on this reaction uses malonic acid (CH2(CO2H)2) as the acid and potassium bromate (KBrO3) as the source of bromine. The overall equation is:
: 3 CH2(CO2H)2 + 4 → 4 Br− + 9 CO2 + 6 H2O

===Variants===
Many variants of the reaction exist. The only key chemical is the bromate oxidizer. The catalyst ion is most often cerium, but it can be also manganese, or complexes of iron, ruthenium, cobalt, copper, chromium, silver, nickel and osmium. Many different reductants can be used. (Zhabotinsky, 1964b; Field and Burger, 1985)

Many different patterns can be observed when the reaction is run in a microemulsion.

<text>Malcolm A. Morley (June 7, 1931 – June 1, 2018) was a British-American visual artist and painter. He was known as an artist who pioneered in various styles, working as a photorealist and an expressionist, among many other genres. In 1984, he won the inaugural Turner Prize.

==Life==
Morley was born in north London. He had a troubled childhood—after his home was partially blown up by a bomb during World War II, his family was homeless for a time. He recalled that he had constructed a balsawood model of and placed it on his windowsill when the German bomb destroyed the house along with the model. &quot;The shock was so violent,&quot; writes one Morley expert, &quot;that Morley repressed this memory until it resurfaced 30 years later during a psychoanalytic session.&quot;

As a teenager, Morley was sentenced to three years at Wormwood Scrubs prison for housebreaking and petty theft. While there, he read Irving Stone&#x27;s 1934 novel &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, based on the life of Vincent van Gogh, and enrolled in an art correspondence course. He would later look back on these rough beginnings with some humor: &quot;I [feel] very sorry for artists that haven&#x27;t had much happen in their early life,&quot; he once said. Released after two years for good behavior, he joined an artists&#x27; colony in St. Ives, Cornwall, then studied art first at the Camberwell School of Arts, described by one art historian as being, at the time, &quot;one of the more progressive and exciting art schools in London,&quot; and then at the Royal College of Art (1955–1957), where his fellow students included Peter Blake and Frank Auerbach. In 1956, he saw the exhibition &quot;Modern Art in the United States: A Selection from the Collections at the Museum of Modern Art&quot; at the Tate Gallery, and began to produce paintings in an abstract expressionist style. All the same, he would later say that &quot;I would have liked to be Pollock, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to be after Pollock. My ambition was too big.&quot;

Morley visited New York City, which was at the time a major center of the Western art world, in 1957. He moved there the following year, after which he met artists including Barnett Newman, Cy Twombly, Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy Warhol. His first solo exhibition was at Kornblee Gallery in 1964, partly at the urging of the art dealer Ivan Karp, who had a reputation as a talent spotter and had worked with the legendary dealer Leo Castelli.

In the mid-1960s, Morley briefly taught at Ohio State University, and then moved back to New York City, where he taught at the School of Visual Arts (1967–1969) and Stony Brook University (1970–1974).

Morley had early solo gallery exhibitions at venues including the Clocktower Gallery, Institute for Art and Urban Resources, New York (1976); Nancy Hoffman Gallery, New York (1979); and Stefanotty Gallery, New York (1979). He participated in the major international exhibition Documenta, in Kassel, in 1972 and 1977, and in the Carnegie International, in 1985.

The Whitechapel Gallery, in London, organized a major retrospective exhibition in 1983, resulting in his winning the inaugural Turner Prize, awarded by the Tate, in 1984. The artist remembered the moment he learned he had won the prize: &quot;When the call came to say he had won, he was sitting in his loft studio in the Bowery, &#x27;watching a bum shitting on the street. It felt unreal: here I was watching this act; the next minute I&#x27;m told I&#x27;ve won the Turner. I was floored.&#x27;&quot;

The following year, he bought a Methodist church in Bellport, Long Island, New York State, where he would reside for the remainder of his life. In the early 1980s he was married to the Brazilian artist Marcia Grostein. Morley was granted American citizenship in 1990. He was the subject of museum exhibitions at venues including Tate Liverpool (1991); the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (1993); Fundación La Caixa, Madrid (1995); the Hayward Gallery, London (2001); and the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (2013–14).

At the time of his death Morley resided in Bellport, New York, where he shared a home with Lida Morley, his loving and caring wife since 1986. He died in Bellport on June 1, 2018, six days shy of his 87th birthday.

==Work==
Morley&#x27;s earliest work upon leaving art school, while remaining in England, adopted traditional, naturalist styles of painting. His work was &quot;a compromise between old-school observation-based naturalism and art that was modern mostly because its subjects were recognizably of the present.&quot;

After his arrival in New York, he began in the early 1960s to work abstractly, creating several paintings made up of only horizontal bands with vague suggestions of nautical themes, whether in imagery or in the works&#x27; titles.

He also met Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and, influenced in part by them, made the drastic change to a photorealist style (Morley preferred the phrase S&quot;uperrealist&quot;). Inspired by seeing Richard Artschwager using this technique, he began to use a grid to transfer photographic images (often of ships) to canvas, and became one of the first and most noted photorealists, along with Gerhard Richter, Richard Artschwager, and Vija Celmins.

After seeing one of Morley&#x27;s paintings of an ocean liner, Artschwager suggested that Morley visit Pier 57 and paint some ships from life. &quot;I went down to Pier 57, took a canvas and tried to make a painting outside,&quot; Morley said. &quot;But it was impossible to comprehend it in one glance, one end is over there, the other end is over there, a 360-degree impossibility. I was in disgust—I took a postcard of this cruise ship called the Queen of Bermuda.&quot; He would adopt this as his style for a few years, transposing images from a variety of sources (travel brochures, calendars, old paintings) to canvas. One factor that distinguished Morley from his photorealist peers was that rather than painting from the photograph itself, he was painting from printed reproductions such as postcards, sometimes even including the white border around a postcard image or the corporate logo from a calendar page. His choice of these bland materials was partly driven by a desire to find pop-culture imagery that other artists, such as Warhol and Lichtenstein, were not already using: “What I wanted was to find an iconography that was untarnished by art.&quot; Morley achieved &quot;instant success&quot; with such work.

In the 1970s, Morley&#x27;s work began to be more expressionist, with looser brushwork, and he began to incorporate collage and performance into his work, for example in 1972, when he was invited to paint a version of Raphael&#x27;s &quot;The School of Athens&quot; at the State University of New York at Potsdam, in front of an audience. He painted in costume as Pythagoras, who appears in the painting. When Morley realized that he failed to align one of the rows, he let the mistake stand in the finished work. His doing so serves as an example for one curator that the gridded reproduction technique is less concerned with faithful reproductions of the old masters and more with &quot;untested possibilities of contemporary painting and pictorial construction.&quot;

His work often drew upon various sources in a process of cross-fertilization. For example, his painting &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1977) draws its title from the 1939 novel &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot;, by Nathanael West. One scene in the painting is drawn from the opening scene of the novel, and other scenes are drawn from the 1954 film &quot;Suddenly&quot; and the 1925 Sergei Eisenstein film &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;. In the painting, the cover of a Los Angeles phone book is superimposed with a welter of imagery, some of it based on his earlier work (cruise ships, airplanes), and some on painted models, which became a mainstay of his subject matter for the remainder of his career. &quot;I don&#x27;t like to call them toys,&quot; the artist said, &quot;I like to call them models. The thing about so-called &#x27;toys&#x27; is that there is an unconsciousness in society that comes out in its toys. Toys represent an archetype of the human figure.&quot;

The artist turned to new subjects, including mythology and the Classical world, in his work of the 1980s, giving his paintings titles like &quot;Aegean Crime&quot; (1987), &quot;Cradle of Civilization with American Woman&quot; (1982), &quot;Farewell to Crete&quot;, and &quot;Black Rainbow Over Oedipus at Thebes&quot; (1988) and depicting Minoan figures; travel to the United States also resulted in prominent use of Native American kachina dolls and other motifs from those cultures. His commercial success offered him the opportunity to travel to these places and many more, resulting in diverse new influences and inspirations. He frequently adopted very loose paint handling, featuring drips and splashes. Similar expressionist brushwork and subject matter by artists such as Julian Schnabel, Eric Fischl, Georg Baselitz, and Anselm Kiefer resulted in curators identifying a &quot;neo-Expressionist&quot; movement, in which they included him, although he disliked the label.

The 1990s saw the artist return to his very early subject matter of large seagoing vessels, often with the addition of fighter planes that he built out of paper, painted with watercolor, and then attached to the surface of the canvas (resulting in, as he told an interviewer, the pun of a &quot;three-dimensional plane&quot;). In one example, &quot;Icarus&#x27;s Flight&quot; (1997), the plane is some fifty-two inches deep. The artist also branched out into full-on free-standing sculpture, with one piece, &quot;Port Clyde&quot; (1990), showing a boat on a window frame, as if referring back to the artist&#x27;s lost childhood model of HMS &quot;Nelson&quot;.

Contemporary photojournalism was the subject of the artist&#x27;s paintings of the following decade, with motorcycle and car racing, football, skiing, swimming, and horse racing coming in for attention. The artist also returned to the &quot;catastrophes&quot; that were among his early subjects, depicting car crashes (including one showing the crash that resulted in the death of auto racing star Dale Earnhardt), the aftermath of the War in Afghanistan, and the collapse of a building in Brooklyn, among other subjects. In the last decade of his life, Morley continued to depict early- and mid-twentieth-century fighter planes, as well as the pilots who flew them during World Wars I and II, including the legendary flying ace Manfred von Richthofen, the &quot;Red Baron.&quot; He also focused on 18th-century English history, creating works that incorporated military figures such as Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington and Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson. &quot;I fell in love with the period,&quot; he once said, &quot;which was a great one for the British.&quot;

<doc id="186266" wikidata="Q9589" url="?curid=186266" title="ITunes">
<text>iTunes is a media player, media library, and mobile device management utility developed by Apple. It is used to purchase, play, download and organize digital multimedia on personal computers running the macOS and Windows operating systems, and can be used to rip songs from CDs as well as playing content from dynamic, smart playlists. It includes options for sound optimization and wirelessly sharing iTunes libraries.

iTunes was announced by Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2001. Its original and main focus was music, with a library offering organization and storage of Mac users&#x27; music collections. With the 2003 addition of the iTunes Store for purchasing and downloading digital music, and a Windows version of the program, it became an ubiquitous tool for managing music and configuring other features on Apple&#x27;s line of iPod media players, which extended to the iPhone and iPad upon their introduction. From 2005 on, Apple expanded its core music features with support for digital video, podcasts, e-books, and mobile apps purchased from the iOS App Store. Since the release of iOS 5 in 2011, these devices have become less dependent on iTunes, though it can still be used to back up their contents.

Though well received in its early years, iTunes received increasing criticism for a bloated user experience, which incorporated features beyond its original focus on music. Beginning with Macs running macOS Catalina, iTunes was replaced by separate apps, namely Music, Podcasts, and TV, with Finder and Apple Devices taking over the device management capabilities. This change did not affect iTunes running on Windows or older macOS versions.

In February 2024, most features of iTunes for Windows were split into the Apple TV, Music, and Apple Devices apps. When the apps are installed, iTunes is still used for podcasts and audiobooks as there is currently no Windows version of Apple Podcasts. iTunes for Windows is still supported, and still receives security &amp; iOS device driver updates.

== History ==

SoundJam MP, released by Casady &amp; Greene in 1999, was renamed &quot;iTunes&quot; when Apple purchased it the next year. The primary developers of the software moved to Apple as part of the acquisition, and simplified SoundJam&#x27;s user interface, added the ability to burn CDs, and removed its recording feature and skin support. The first version of iTunes, promotionally dubbed &quot;World&#x27;s Best and Easiest To Use Jukebox Software&quot;, was announced on January 9, 2001. Subsequent releases of iTunes often coincided with new hardware devices, and gradually included support for new features, including &quot;smart playlists&quot;, the iTunes Store, and new audio formats.

=== Platform availability ===
Apple released iTunes for Windows on October 16, 2003.

On April 26, 2018, iTunes was released on Microsoft Store for Windows 10, primarily to allow it to be installed on Windows 10 devices configured to only allow installation of software from Microsoft Store. Unlike Windows versions for other platforms, it is more self-contained due to technical requirements for distribution on the store (not installing background helper services such as Bonjour), and is updated automatically through the store rather than using Apple Software Update.

The role of iTunes has been replaced with independent apps, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and Apple TV; with iPhone, iPod, and iPad management integrated into the Finder starting with macOS 10.15 Catalina, and appearing as Apple Devices starting with Windows 10.

== Music library ==
iTunes features a music library. Each track has attributes, called metadata, that can be edited by the user, including changing the name of the artist, album, and genre, year of release, artwork, among other additional settings. The software supports importing digital audio tracks that can then be transferred to iOS devices, as well as supporting ripping content from CDs. iTunes supports WAV, AIFF, Apple Lossless, AAC, and MP3 audio formats. It uses the Gracenote music database to provide track name listings for audio CDs. When users rip content from a CD, iTunes attempts to match songs to the Gracenote service. For self-published CDs, or those from obscure record labels, iTunes would normally only list tracks as numbered entries (&quot;Track 1&quot; and &quot;Track 2&quot;) on an unnamed album by an unknown artist, requiring manual input of data.

File metadata is displayed in users&#x27; libraries in columns, including album, artist, genre, composer, and more. Users can enable or disable different columns, as well as change view settings.

=== Special playlists ===
Introduced in 2004, &quot;Party Shuffle&quot; selected tracks to play randomly from the library, though users could press a button to skip a song and go to the next in the list. The feature was later renamed &quot;iTunes DJ&quot;, before being discontinued altogether, replaced by a simpler &quot;Up Next&quot; feature that notably lost some of &quot;iTunes DJ&quot;&#x27;s functionality.

Introduced in iTunes 8 in 2008, &quot;&quot; can automatically generate a playlist of songs from the user&#x27;s library that &quot;go great together&quot;. &quot;Genius&quot; transmits information about the user&#x27;s library to Apple anonymously, and evolves over time to enhance its recommendation system. It can also suggest purchases to fill out &quot;holes&quot; in the library. The feature was updated with iTunes 9 in 2009 to offer &quot;Genius Mixes&quot;, which generated playlists based on specific music genres.

&quot;Smart playlists&quot; are a set of playlists that can be set to automatically filter the library based on a customized list of selection criteria, much like a database query. Multiple criteria can be entered to manage the smart playlist. Selection criteria examples include a genre like Christmas music, songs that have not been played recently, or songs the user has listened to the most in a time period.

=== Library sharing ===
Through a &quot;Home Sharing&quot; feature, users can share their iTunes library wirelessly. Computer firewalls must allow network traffic, and users must specifically enable sharing in the iTunes preferences menu. iOS applications also exist that can transfer content without Internet. Additionally, users can set up a network-attached storage system, and connect to that storage system through an app.

=== Sound processing ===
iTunes includes sound processing features, such as equalization, &quot;sound enhancement&quot; and crossfade. There is also a feature called , which normalizes the playback volume of all songs in the library to the same level.

== Online music functionality ==

=== iTunes Store ===

Introduced on April 28, 2003, The iTunes Music Store allows users to buy and download songs, with 200,000 tracks available at launch. In its first week, customers bought more than one million songs. Music purchased was protected by FairPlay, an encryption layer referred to as digital rights management (DRM). The use of DRM, which limited devices capable of playing purchased files, sparked efforts to remove the protection mechanism. Eventually, after an open letter to the music industry by CEO Steve Jobs in February 2007, Apple introduced a selection of DRM-free music in the iTunes Store in April 2007, followed by its entire music catalog without DRM in January 2009.

=== iTunes in the Cloud and iTunes Match ===
In June 2011, Apple announced &quot;iTunes in the Cloud&quot;, in which music purchases were stored on Apple&#x27;s servers and made available for automatic downloading on new devices. For music the user owns, such as content ripped from CDs, the company introduced &quot;iTunes Match&quot;, a feature that can upload content to Apple&#x27;s servers, match it to its catalog, change the quality to 256 kbit/s AAC format, and make it available to other devices.

=== Internet radio, iTunes Radio and Apple Music ===

When iTunes was first released, it came with support for the Kerbango Internet radio tuner service. In June 2013, the company announced iTunes Radio, a free music streaming service. In June 2015, Apple announced Apple Music, a subscription-based music streaming service, and subsequently integrated iTunes Radio functionality. Music tracks provided by Apple Music via iTunes are available at up to 256 kbit/s AAC fidelity. The Apple Music app also integrates Apple Music 1, a live music radio station.

=== Phasing out ===
As of 2024, Apple is phasing out iTunes in favour of three dedicated apps, Music, Podcasts, and TV, but the iTunes Store will still remain.

== Other features ==

=== Video ===
In May 2005, video support was introduced to iTunes with the release of iTunes 4.8, though it was limited to bonus features part of album purchases. The following October, Apple introduced iTunes 6, enabling support for purchasing and viewing video content purchased from the iTunes Store. At launch, the store offered popular shows from the ABC network, including &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;, along with Disney Channel series &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; and &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;. CEO Steve Jobs told the press that &quot;We&#x27;re doing for video what we&#x27;ve done for music — we&#x27;re making it easy and affordable to purchase and download, play on your computer, and take with you on your iPod.&quot;

In 2008, Apple and select film studios introduced &quot;iTunes Digital Copy&quot;, a feature on select DVDs and Blu-ray discs allowing a digital copy in iTunes and associated media players.

=== Podcasts ===
In June 2005, Apple updated iTunes with support for podcasts. Users can subscribe to podcasts, change update frequency, define how many episodes to download and how many to delete.

Similar to songs, &quot;Smart playlists&quot; can be used to control podcasts in a playlist, setting criteria such as date and number of times listened to.

Apple is credited for being the major catalyst behind the early growth of podcasting.

=== Apps ===

On July 10, 2008, Apple introduced native mobile apps for its iOS operating system. On iOS, a dedicated App Store application served as the storefront for browsing, downloading, updating, and otherwise managing applications, whereas iTunes on computers had a dedicated section for apps rather than a separate app. In September 2017, Apple updated iTunes to version 12.7, removing the App Store section in the process. iTunes 12.6.3 was released the following month, retaining App Store functionality, with &quot;9to5Mac&quot; noting that the secondary release was positioned by Apple as &quot;necessary for some businesses performing internal app deployments&quot;.

=== iTunes U ===
In May 2007, Apple announced the launch of &quot;iTunes U&quot; via the iTunes Store, which delivers university lectures from top U.S. colleges. With iTunes version 12.7 in August 2017, iTunes U collections became a part of the Podcasts app. On June 10, 2020, Apple formally announced that iTunes U would be discontinued at the end of 2021.

=== Apple mobile device connectivity ===
iTunes was required to activate early iPhone and iPad devices. Beginning with the iPhone 3G in June 2008, activation did not require iTunes, making use of activation at point of sale. Later iPhone models are able to be activated and set-up on their own, without requiring the use of iTunes.

iTunes also allows users to backup and restore the content of their Apple mobile devices, such as music, photos, videos, ringtones and device settings, and restore the firmware of their devices. However, as of iTunes 12.7, apps can no longer be purchased and installed using iTunes.

=== Ping ===

With the release of iTunes 10 in September 2010, Apple announced iTunes Ping, which CEO Steve Jobs described as &quot;social music discovery&quot;. It had features reminiscent of Facebook, including profiles and the ability to follow other users. Ping was discontinued in September 2012.

== Criticism ==
=== Security ===
&quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported in November 2011 that Apple had been aware of a security vulnerability since 2008 that would let unauthorized third parties install &quot;updates&quot; to users&#x27; iTunes software. Apple fixed the issue before the &quot;Telegraph&quot;″s report and told the media that &quot;The security and privacy of our users is extremely important&quot;, though this was questioned by security researcher Brian Krebs, who told the publication that &quot;A prominent security researcher warned Apple about this dangerous vulnerability in mid-2008, yet the company waited more than 1,200 days to fix the flaw.&quot;

=== Software bloat ===
iTunes has been repeatedly accused of being bloated as part of Apple&#x27;s efforts to turn it from a music player to an all-encompassing multimedia platform. Former &quot;PC World&quot; editor Ed Bott accused the company of hypocrisy in its advertising attacks on Windows for similar practices.

<doc id="186267" wikidata="Q223311" url="?curid=186267" title="Eli Cohen">
<text>Eliyahu Ben-Shaul Cohen (‎; ‎; 6 December 1924 – 18 May 1965) was an Egyptian-born Israeli spy. He is best known for his espionage work in Syria between 1961 and 1965, where he developed close relationships with the Syrian political and military hierarchy.

Though he was initially successful, Cohen&#x27;s activity became increasingly risky and he expressed a sense of impending danger to Mossad in 1964. A year later, his true allegiance was uncovered by Syrian intelligence and he was convicted by the Syrian government under pre-war martial law. After being sentenced to death, he was publicly hanged in Damascus in May 1965. The incident contributed to the sharp escalation of hostilities between Israel and Syria just before the 1967 Arab–Israeli War.

Cohen is highly regarded in Israel, with several streets and roads being named after him.

==Early life==
Cohen was born in Alexandria, Egypt, to a family of Mizrahi Jews. His father had immigrated from Aleppo in the Ottoman Empire in 1914. Deeply committed to Judaism, Cohen had planned in his youth to become a rabbi with guidance from (1893–1978), Alexandria&#x27;s Chief Rabbi, but the city&#x27;s yeshiva soon closed down, prompting him to pursue higher education at Cairo University. A staunch Zionist, he helped Israel evacuate the Egyptian Jewish community by assisting Israeli intelligence throughout Egypt. He was also fluent in five languages: Arabic, Hebrew, English, French, and Spanish.

=== Onset of the Arab–Israeli conflict ===
At the onset of the Jewish exodus from the Muslim world, which began concurrently with the Arab–Israeli conflict, Cohen&#x27;s parents and three brothers immigrated to Israel in 1949, but he stayed behind to complete his degree and also to help consolidate Zionist efforts among Egypt&#x27;s Jewish community. Prior to the 1952 Egyptian revolution, he was arrested and interrogated by Egyptian authorities, who were becoming suspicious of his activities. 

Nonetheless, he continued to engage in various Israeli covert efforts in Egypt throughout the 1950s, although the Egyptian government could never prove his involvement in Operation Goshen, by which the Israeli government smuggled a significant number of Egypt&#x27;s Jews out of the country and resettled them in Israel. Cohen is also said to have aided Egyptian Jews who were taking part in what would become known as the Lavon Affair, by which Israel sought to sabotage Egypt&#x27;s relationship with the Western world. Two members of the spy ring were caught and sentenced to death, but the Egyptian government was unable to find a link between Cohen and the perpetrators.

=== Emigration from Egypt ===
By December 1956, just after the Suez Crisis, he was forced to leave Egypt; his immigration to Israel was facilitated by the Jewish Agency. In 1959, he married Nadia Majald (born ), an Iraqi-born Jew with whom he would have three children (Sophie, Irit, and Shai) after settling down in Bat Yam. Through this marriage, Cohen became the brother-in-law of Israeli author Sami Michael.

== Career ==
The Israel Defense Forces recruited him in 1957 and placed him in military intelligence, where he became a counter-intelligence analyst and a translator. His work bored him and he attempted to join the Mossad, but he was offended when the Mossad rejected him, and he resigned from military counter-intelligence. For the next two years, he worked as a filing clerk in a Tel Aviv insurance office.

=== Enlistment with Mossad ===
The Mossad recruited Cohen after Director-General Meir Amit, looking for an intelligence officer to infiltrate the Syrian government, came across his name while looking through the agency&#x27;s files of rejected candidates, after none of the current candidates seemed suitable for the job. For two weeks Cohen was put under surveillance and was judged suitable for recruitment and training. Cohen was then informed that Mossad had decided to recruit him and underwent an intensive six-month course at the Mossad training school. His graduate report stated that he had all the qualities needed to become a &quot;katsa&quot;, or field agent.

==== Espionage in Syria ====
He was then given a false identity as a Syrian businessman who was returning to the country after living in Argentina. To establish his cover, Cohen moved to Buenos Aires in 1961. In Buenos Aires he moved among the Arab community, letting it be known he had large amounts of money to put at the disposal of the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath Party. At this time the Ba&#x27;ath Party was illegal in Syria but the party seized power in 1963.

Cohen moved to Damascus in February 1962 under the alias Kamel Amin Thabet () and lived in Al Mahdi Ibn Barakeh Street of the Abu Rummaneh neighbourhood, an area which contained various embassies and government buildings, including the Air Force Intelligence Directorate. Mossad had carefully planned the tactics that he was to use in building relationships with high-ranking Syrian politicians, military officials, influential public figures, and the diplomatic community.

Cohen continued his social life as he had in Argentina, spending time in cafes listening to political gossip. He also held parties at his home for high-placed Syrian ministers, businessmen, and others. At these parties, Cohen &quot;dispensed free-flowing liquor and prostitutes&quot; and highly-placed officials would openly discuss their work and army plans. Cohen would pretend to be drunk to encourage such conversations, to which he paid close attention. He would also lend money to government officials, and many came to him for advice. Cohen was so ingrained in the Syrian elite that he was on the short list for deputy minister of defense right before his arrest.

Cohen provided an extensive amount and wide range of intelligence data for the Israeli Army between 1961 and 1965. He sent intelligence to Israel by radio, secret letters, and occasionally in person; he secretly travelled to Israel three times. His most famous achievement was the tour of the Golan Heights in which he collected intelligence on the Syrian fortifications there. According to an unconfirmed but widely believed story, he feigned sympathy for the soldiers exposed to the sun and had trees planted at every position, placed to provide shade. The Israel Defense Forces were alleged to have used the trees as targeting markers during the Six-Day War, which enabled Israel to capture the Golan Heights in two days. Cohen made repeated visits to the southern frontier zone, providing photographs and sketches of Syrian positions. He also learned of a secret plan to create three successive lines of bunkers and mortars; the Israel Defense Forces would otherwise have expected to encounter only a single line. Cohen was able to find out that the Syrians planned to divert the Jordan River headwaters in an attempt to deprive Israel of water resources, providing information to Israeli forces that enabled them to destroy the equipment prepared for the task during the &quot;War over Water&quot;. It is claimed that the intelligence that Cohen gathered before his arrest was an important factor in Israel&#x27;s success in the Six-Day War, although some intelligence experts have argued that the information he provided about the Golan Heights fortifications was also readily available from ground and aerial reconnaissance.

A 2018 article published in &quot;Newsweek&quot; by Ronen Bergman excerpted from Bergman&#x27;s book &quot;Rise and Kill First&quot;, says that Eli Cohen located Alois Brunner, a former Nazi official and Holocaust perpetrator suspected of living in Syria, and relayed the information to an Israeli intelligence unit that subsequently sent letter bombs to Brunner.

==== Discovery ====
Following the 1963 Syrian coup d&#x27;état, newly appointed Syrian Intelligence Colonel Ahmed Suidani disliked Cohen and did not trust figures close to the Second Syrian Republic. Cohen expressed fear of discovery to the Mossad on his last secret visit to Israel in November 1964, and he stated that he wished to terminate his assignment in Syria. The purposes of that visit were to pass on intelligence and to enable him to witness the birth of his third child. Despite this, however, Israeli intelligence asked him to return to Syria one more time. Before leaving, Cohen assured his wife it would be his last trip before he returned home permanently.

In January 1965, Syrian officials, who used Soviet-made tracking equipment and were assisted by Soviet experts, increased their efforts to find a high-level spy. They observed a period of radio silence, in the hope that any illegal transmissions could be identified. They successfully detected radio transmissions and were able to triangulate the transmitter. Syrian security services led by Suidani broke into Cohen&#x27;s apartment on 24 January and claimed to have caught him in the middle of a transmission to Israel.

==Death==

Cohen was found guilty of espionage by a military tribunal and sentenced to death under martial law. He had been repeatedly interrogated and tortured.

Israel staged an international campaign for clemency, hoping to persuade Syria not to execute him. Israeli foreign minister Golda Meir led a campaign urging Damascus to consider the consequences of hanging him. Diplomats, prime ministers, parliamentarians, and Pope Paul VI tried to intercede. Meir even appealed to the Soviet Union. The governments of Belgium, Canada, and France tried to persuade the Syrian government to commute the death sentence, but the Syrians refused. Nadia Cohen attempted to appeal for clemency at the Syrian Embassy in Paris but was turned away. Cohen wrote in his final letter on 15 May 1965:
I am begging you, my dear Nadia, not to spend your time in weeping about something already passed. Concentrate on yourself, looking forward for a better future!

Cohen was publicly hanged in the Marjeh Square in Damascus on 18 May 1965. The execution was recorded on 35 mm film. On the day of his execution, his last wish to see a rabbi was respected by the prison authorities, and Nissim Indibo, the elderly Chief Rabbi of Syria, accompanied him in the truck. He was also allowed to write a final letter to his wife.

=== Burial ===
Syria refused to return Cohen&#x27;s body to his family in Israel, and his wife Nadia sent a letter to Amin al-Hafiz in November 1965 asking his forgiveness for Cohen&#x27;s actions and requesting his remains. In February 2007, Turkey offered to act as a mediator for their return.

Monthir Maosily, the former bureau chief of Hafez al-Assad, claimed in August 2008 that the Syrians had buried him three times to stop the remains from being taken back to Israel via a special operation. Syrian authorities have repeatedly denied family requests for the remains. Cohen&#x27;s brothers Abraham and Maurice led a campaign to return his remains; Maurice died in 2006, and Nadia now leads it.

In 2016, a Syrian group calling itself &quot;Syrian art treasures&quot; posted a video on Facebook showing Cohen&#x27;s body after his execution. No film or video was previously known to exist of the execution. The press announced on 5 July 2018 that Cohen&#x27;s wristwatch had been retrieved from Syria. His widow mentioned that the watch was up for sale months earlier, and Mossad managed to capture it. Mossad director Yossi Cohen presented it to Cohen&#x27;s family in a ceremony, and it is currently on display at Mossad headquarters.

==Legacy==

Cohen has become a national hero in Israel, and many streets and neighbourhoods have been named for him. Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Defense Minister Ezer Weizmann, Chief of Staff Mordechai Gur, and several Mossad operatives all attended his son&#x27;s Bar Mitzvah in 1977. A memorial stone has been erected to Cohen in the Garden of the Missing Soldiers in Mount Herzl, Jerusalem.

John Shea played Cohen in the television film &quot;The Impossible Spy&quot; (1987), and Sacha Baron Cohen played him in the Netflix miniseries &quot;The Spy&quot; (2019).

The Israeli village Eliad in the Golan Heights is named after him.

<text>Jeffrey Jason Garcia (born February 24, 1970) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). After attending high school and junior college in Gilroy, California, Garcia played college football at San Jose State University.

A four-time CFL All-Star and four-time NFL Pro Bowl selection, Garcia began his professional football career with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) as an undrafted free agent in 1994. In 1999, Garcia debuted in the National Football League (NFL) with the San Francisco 49ers. With the 49ers, Garcia made three Pro Bowl appearances (for the 2000, 2001, and 2002 seasons) and led the team to the playoffs in the 2001 and 2002 seasons. Afterwards, Garcia encountered a low point in his career, starting with a lackluster 2003 season with San Francisco then two losing seasons with the Cleveland Browns in 2004 and the Detroit Lions in 2005. With the Philadelphia Eagles, Garcia returned to form late in the 2006 season, starting for an injured Donovan McNabb and leading Philadelphia to the playoffs. Garcia joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2007 and was the starting quarterback for most games of the 2007 and 2008 seasons. Again, Garcia led Tampa Bay to the playoffs in 2007 and made his fourth career Pro Bowl appearance.

After his stint with Tampa, Garcia returned to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2009 and played only one game. In 2010, Garcia played for the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League. In 2011, Garcia signed with the Houston Texans but did not play a game with the team. The following year, Garcia joined the advisory board for the now defunct United States Football League.

==Early life==
Garcia attended Gilroy High School in Gilroy, California, and was a letterman in football and basketball. As a senior at Gilroy High, Garcia was a South Santa Clara County selection for the Charlie Wedemeyer All-Star Football Game and played defensive back in the game.

==College career==
After graduating from Gilroy in 1988, Garcia attended Gavilan College, a local junior college. He was the starting quarterback on the football team for the 1989 season, in which he passed 2,038 yards for 18 touchdowns and rushed 584 yards for four touchdowns. After the season, Garcia earned junior college honorable mention All-America honors.

In 1990, Garcia transferred to San Jose State University and redshirted his first year there. From 1991 to 1993, Garcia was starting quarterback on the San Jose State Spartans football team. Under Garcia, San Jose State went 6–4–1 in 1991, 7–4 in 1992, and 2–9 in 1993. In 1991, Garcia had a career-high 61.9% completion rate at San Jose State with 99-for-160 passing for 1,519 yards, 12 touchdowns, and 5 interceptions. He passed for 2,418 yards in 1992 on 209-for-371 passing with 15 touchdowns and 11 interceptions and a career-high 2,608 yards in 1993 on 196-for-356 passing, 21 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. For his junior season in 1992, Garcia earned UPI All-America honors. As of 2007, Garcia had the most career offensive yards (7,274) in San Jose State history.

==Professional career==
Garcia is one of only eighteen quarterbacks in NFL history who have achieved two consecutive thirty-touchdown passing seasons (2000 and 2001) at least one time in his career. The others are Philip Rivers, Steve Bartkowski, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Dan Fouts, Dan Marino, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Y. A. Tittle, Eli Manning, Tony Romo, Russell Wilson, Patrick Mahomes, Kirk Cousins, Josh Allen, Justin Herbert, and Joe Burrow. He is also one of only thirteen quarterbacks to throw a 99-yard touchdown pass.

===Calgary Stampeders===
At 6-foot-1 and 195 pounds, Garcia was considered too small for the National Football League and was not selected in the 1994 NFL draft. In 1994, Garcia started his professional career in Calgary with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. He won a place on Calgary&#x27;s roster as their third-string quarterback behind Doug Flutie and Steve Taylor when he threw two fourth-quarter touchdowns in his exhibition game appearance in 1994; soon after, he was named backup quarterback to Flutie. Garcia took over as starter in 1995 when Flutie was sidelined midway through the season with an elbow injury. In his second start filling in for Flutie, Garcia set a team record with 546 passing yards and six touchdown passes in the Labour Day game against Edmonton touching off an eventual quarterback controversy among some fans when Flutie later returned. Flutie ended up starting over Garcia in the Grey Cup that year which the Stampeders lost. After Flutie signed as a free-agent with the Toronto Argonauts in 1996, Garcia took over as the Stampeders&#x27; starting quarterback. During Garcia&#x27;s three years as starter, the Stampeders finished with records of 13–5, 10–8, and 12–6.

In 1997, Garcia won the Jeff Nicklin Memorial Trophy, an award given to the Most Outstanding Player in the CFL Western Division. Garcia led the Stampeders to the Western Final in 1996 and to the Western Semi-Final in 1997. In 1998, he led the team to a Grey Cup victory over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and was named Grey Cup MVP. Garcia&#x27;s performance included an 80-yard, game-ending drive to set up the game-winning field goal on the last play of the game. Garcia was also named as the 1998 CFL All-Star at quarterback.

Garcia was inducted to the Stampeders Wall of Fame on September 14, 2012, along with 5 others (Rudy Linterman, Gerry Shaw, Kelvin Anderson, Sig Gutsche, Norman Kwong).

===San Francisco 49ers===
Following the Grey Cup victory, Garcia was signed as a backup to Steve Young with the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League. Over the summer, he had been fighting for a spot on the roster, but early in the 1999 season, Steve Young was hit by Arizona Cardinals cornerback Aeneas Williams and suffered his final professional concussion, knocking him out for the year. Garcia stepped in and shared time with former Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom finishing the season.

Garcia won his first NFL start against the Tennessee Titans 24–22. After being benched for poor performances, Garcia was reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final five games of the regular season, finished by tossing 8 touchdown passes to only 2 interceptions. Garcia finished his rookie season with 11 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

====2000====
The following season, with Young retired, and despite the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks (Giovanni Carmazzi in the third round and Tim Rattay in the seventh), Garcia kept the starting quarterback position and made his first Pro Bowl appearance. He set a new 49ers&#x27; team record with 4,278 passing yards in the 2000 season, although the team finished with a 6–10 record. Garcia finished the 2000 season, his first as a full-time starter with 31 touchdown passes to only 10 INTs. Garcia began the season on a tear, after 7 games, he had thrown for 19 touchdown passes, including 3 games of 4 touchdown passes.

====2001====
By the 2001 season, Garcia had become entrenched as the 49ers&#x27; starting quarterback. He had a career-high with 32 touchdown passes, including 21 over an eight-game span. With Garcia at quarterback, the 49ers made their first playoff appearance in almost two years, but fell to Green Bay 25–15 in the first round.

====2002====
2002 saw Garcia&#x27;s offensive production drop from 31 and 32 TDs in the previous two seasons, to only 21. But even though Garcia&#x27;s numbers dropped, the 49ers won the NFC West for the first time since 1997, with the division-clinching game coming on a last-second TD pass to Terrell Owens against the Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers trailed the Cowboys 27–17 with under 7 minutes left in the game before Garcia picked apart the Cowboy secondary for 2 touchdown passes (one to Tai Streets and the game winner to Terrell Owens). Garcia completed 36 of 55 passes for 276 yards and 3 4th-quarter touchdown passes in the division-clinching win.

On January 5, 2003, during the 2002–2003 playoffs, Garcia led the 49ers to a comeback win over the New York Giants, the second largest comeback victory in NFL playoff history. In the third quarter, the Giants were up 38–14, with about eighteen minutes left to play. Once the 49ers regained possession of the ball, they began a comeback that saw 25 unanswered points, with San Francisco taking a 39–38 lead. The Giants lost an opportunity to retake the lead after a controversial call, and the improbable victory became the signature game of Garcia&#x27;s 49er career. He threw for 331 yards, 3 touchdowns, 1 interception, and also ran for 60 yards and 1 touchdown.

====Garcia–Owens: 49er duo====
Garcia&#x27;s favorite target while with the 49ers was WR Terrell Owens. In 2003, Garcia and Owens&#x27;s relationship turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens&#x27;s public praise for the play of backup quarterback Tim Rattay. Garcia responded with a cryptic &quot;we cannot let the sickness spread&quot; remark, prompting Owens to wear a surgeon&#x27;s mask at the following practice. Following Owens&#x27;s trade to Philadelphia, Owens was asked in a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview if he thought Garcia was gay, to which he responded, &quot;If it looks like a rat and smells like a rat, by golly, it is a rat.&quot; Garcia called Owens&#x27; insinuations &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;untrue.&quot;

Following his 2004 trade to Philadelphia, Owens began speaking out and criticizing Garcia for the 49ers&#x27; offensive struggles during the 2003 season (the 49ers finished 7–9, with Garcia throwing 18 touchdowns and 13 interceptions during the season).

Garcia revealed on multiple occasions that the pressure of following in the footsteps of Joe Montana and Steve Young had gotten to him.

Upon his departure, Garcia said, &quot;Have somebody step into my shoes and feel what I had to deal with throughout that whole time in San Francisco. The dust would start to settle, and all of a sudden, more fuel was thrown into the fire. It was such a negative situation.&quot;

In Owens&#x27; first season with Jeff Garcia as his quarterback, Owens caught 60 passes and went on to have campaigns of 97, 93, 100 and 80 receptions over the next four seasons, two times leading the league in touchdown catches.

====2003: Final season with 49ers====
The 2003 season was a disappointment for Garcia and the 49ers. Following their 2002 playoff loss at the hands of the eventual Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the 49ers fired head coach Steve Mariucci and replaced him with former Seattle Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson, who promised a wide open and vertical passing game.

Injuries to key players on both sides of the ball, and the often reckless play of Garcia, took a toll on him, as he missed three games during the season. The 49ers finished 7–9 and missed the playoffs for the first time in three seasons.

Following the 2003 season, Garcia was released.

===Cleveland Browns===
Garcia signed a contract with the Cleveland Browns on March 9, 2004. Garcia was released by the Browns after the 2004 season, in which he struggled to find any consistency and battled with injuries. On September 19, Garcia completed 8-of-27 passes for 71 yards and 3 interceptions in a 19–12 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, resulting in a career-low passer rating of 0. Despite his struggles, Garcia tied the record for longest career pass play (99 yards) on a completion to André Davis on October 17, in a win against the Cincinnati Bengals.

===Detroit Lions===
He was signed by the Detroit Lions to a one-year contract on March 12, 2005, to play for his former San Francisco head coach, Steve Mariucci, but Garcia broke his fibula in the fourth pre-season game against the Buffalo Bills on September 2. He started his first regular-season game as quarterback for the Lions on October 23, against his former teammates, the Browns. Garcia led the Lions to a 13–10 victory completing 22 of his 34 pass attempts for 210 yards, with one touchdown and zero interceptions.

After the win, Mariucci named Garcia the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, over Joey Harrington, the longtime Detroit starter. Garcia struggled later in the season and Harrington returned as the starter. Following the season, the Lions did not offer Garcia a new contract.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
On March 15, 2006, after consecutive frustrating seasons with the Browns and Lions, Garcia signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles to serve as the primary backup to Donovan McNabb in 2006. McNabb had been lost to injury the previous season, and the Eagles went 1–6 without him and missed the playoffs just a year removed from their Super Bowl appearance. Because McNabb was already wearing number 5, Garcia had his jersey number changed to 7, previously worn in Philadelphia by Ron Jaworski.

Following McNabb&#x27;s season-ending knee injury in a game against the Tennessee Titans on November 19, 2006, Garcia entered the game. Coach Andy Reid named Garcia as the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season over fellow backup A. J. Feeley, despite Feeley&#x27;s popularity in Philadelphia (Feeley had previously gone 4–1 in 2002 when McNabb was injured). Garcia&#x27;s first start for the Eagles came against the Colts on &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;.

With a 45–21 loss to Indianapolis dropping the Eagles below .500, many sportscasters (namely Jimmy Johnson) predicted the Eagles to be out of contention for the rest of the season. However, Garcia led the Eagles to five consecutive victories and the NFC East division championship. The rejuvenated quarterback threw ten touchdowns and only two interceptions, while posting a QB rating of 95.8 in eight total games played. He also made the front cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; following his five-game winning streak. On January 7, 2007, Garcia earned only his second ever playoff win, throwing for 153 yards and one touchdown in a 23–20 victory over the Giants. On January 13, 2007, Garcia and the Eagles lost to the New Orleans Saints by a score of 27–24. He threw for 240 yards, 75 of which came on a touchdown to Donté Stallworth (setting the record for the longest passing touchdown in Eagles&#x27; postseason history).

Though he stated that he would love to re-sign with Philadelphia, the Eagles decided not to offer Garcia a new contract after the season. The Eagles opted to instead sign the younger Feeley to a three-year deal, and avoid a potential quarterback controversy between Garcia and McNabb.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===

After his run with the Eagles, Garcia signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 3, 2007, to compete for their starting position. Although his more familiar number 5 was available, Garcia decided to keep the number 7 he wore with the Eagles. He was named the Buccaneers&#x27; starting quarterback for 2007.

Taking over the reins of a Buccaneers team that went 4–12 in 2006, Garcia led them to the NFC South division title. The Buccaneers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants, 24–14, in the Wild Card Round. Garcia would be named to his fourth Pro Bowl that season, his first since 2002. The Buccaneers would not return to the playoffs until the 2020 season.

In the 2008 season opener, Garcia left the game due to injury. Tampa would end up using a &quot;quarterback by committee&quot; rotation between Garcia, Brian Griese, and Luke McCown through the year. During a victory over the Seattle Seahawks, Garcia passed for 310 yards, surpassing 40,000 yards for his career when combining his statistics from both the CFL and NFL, becoming the twentieth player to accomplish the feat. The uncertainty at quarterback led to the Buccaneers losing their final four games in a row, dropping to 9–7 and out of the playoffs. They ultimately decided to move on from Garcia and not re-sign him in the offseason.

===Oakland Raiders===
Garcia signed a one-year deal with the Oakland Raiders on April 6, 2009. As he did in Tampa Bay, Bruce Gradkowski changed his number to 5 to allow Garcia to wear number 7. He was expected to back up JaMarcus Russell in the 2009 season, but was released during final cuts on September 5, 2009.

===Philadelphia Eagles (second stint)===
After Eagles&#x27; quarterback Donovan McNabb suffered a fractured rib in week one, the Eagles signed Garcia to a one-year contract on September 14, 2009. He was released on September 29, following Michael Vick&#x27;s return from suspension. During this short stint with the Eagles, he wore jersey number 9.

===Omaha Nighthawks===
Garcia was one of the signature players of the United Football League and his former team, the Omaha Nighthawks. He won two offensive player of the week awards during the 2010 season, having produced a game-winning drive in two separate games.

===Houston Texans===
On December 6, 2011, Garcia signed with the Houston Texans, following an injury to starting quarterback Matt Schaub. Jake Delhomme was also signed by Houston, as both he and Garcia would back up T. J. Yates.

==Post-playing career==
Garcia joined the advisory board of the revival of the United States Football League (USFL) in May 2012. In August 2014 Garcia was hired as an offensive consultant by the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL. Just days later he was named the Alouettes&#x27; quarterbacks coach. In May 2015, the Los Angeles Rams hired Garcia as an offensive assistant which lasted for one season. Garcia has shown interest in developing the skills and mechanics in other quarterbacks, as he has worked with Matt McGloin, Mark Sanchez, and Tyrod Taylor. Garcia has also expressed his interest in developing Colin Kaepernick&#x27;s mechanics and skills as well.

==Personal life==

Garcia is the third of seven children born to Bob and Linda (née Elder) Garcia. His father is a former athletic director and football coach at Gavilan College in his hometown of Gilroy, California. A pair of twin girls died before Garcia&#x27;s birth. His younger brother Jason drowned on a family camping trip in 1977 when Garcia was seven, and fourteen months later his younger sister Kimberly died after falling out of a truck. His two surviving sisters, Jene and Melissa, were born after the deaths of Jason and Kimberly. Garcia has said that much of his drive stems from trying to make his parents happy after the deaths of his siblings.

His maternal grandfather, Maurice &quot;Red&quot; Elder, was a football star at Kansas State University in the 1930s; both played in the East–West Shrine Game while in college, the only grandfather-grandson duo to do so. Elder was a longtime coach at Gilroy High School. Garcia donated money to refurbish the athletic field at the school, and in 2005, the field was renamed Garcia-Elder Field to honor both of them.

Garcia, who is of Mexican and Irish heritage, has also done various charitable work in support of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund.

On April 21, 2007, Garcia married Carmella DeCesare, an American model who was &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s Miss April 2003 and Playmate of the Year for 2004 at the CordeValle Resort in San Martin, California. They have four children. In a Christmas Day 2020 reply to a poster on his Instagram account, Garcia stated that he and DeCesare were divorced, saying, &quot;Things happen but we are still great friends and co parent our beautiful 4 kids together. All is good man.&quot;

==Charity work==
Garcia and DeCesare founded the Garcia Pass It On Foundation in order to share resources with people in less fortunate circumstances. The Foundation is closed.

<doc id="186272" wikidata="Q2320915" url="?curid=186272" title="Catholicos of All Armenians">
<text>The Catholicos of All Armenians () is the chief bishop and spiritual leader of Armenia&#x27;s national church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, and the worldwide Armenian diaspora. The Armenian Catholicos (plural Catholicoi) is also known as the Armenian Pontiff (Վեհափառ, &quot;Vehapar&quot; or Վեհափառ Հայրապետ, &quot;Vehapar Hayrapet&quot;) and by other titles. According to tradition, the apostles Saint Thaddeus and Saint Bartholomew brought Christianity to Armenia in the first century. Saint Gregory the Illuminator became the first Catholicos of All Armenians following the nation&#x27;s adoption of Christianity as its official religion in 301 AD. The seat of the Catholicos, and the spiritual and administrative headquarters of the Armenian Church, is the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, located in the city of Vagharshapat.

The Armenian Apostolic Church is part of the Oriental Orthodox communion. This communion includes the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

The current Catholicos is Karekin II.

==Other names==
The Catholicos is often referred to both by the church and the media as the Armenian Pontiff. Historically, the Catholicos was known in English and other languages as the Armenian Patriarch or the Patriarch of Armenia, and sometimes as the Patriarch of Etchmiadzin (or Echmiadzin) to distinguish from the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople and the Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem. To distinguish from the Catholicos (or Patriarch) of Cilicia, historically based in Sis and now in Lebanon, he may be referred to as the Catholicos of Etchmiadzin. To underscore his supremacy over other patriarchs, the Catholicos is sometimes referred to in English as the Armenian Pope.

<text>In mathematics, if is an associative algebra over , then an element of is an algebraic element over , or just algebraic over , if there exists some non-zero polynomial formula_1 with coefficients in such that . Elements of that are not algebraic over are transcendental over . A special case of an associative algebra over formula_2 is an extension field formula_3 of formula_2.

These notions generalize the algebraic numbers and the transcendental numbers (where the field extension is , with being the field of complex numbers and being the field of rational numbers).

== Examples ==
* The square root of 2 is algebraic over , since it is the root of the polynomial whose coefficients are rational.
* Pi is transcendental over but algebraic over the field of real numbers : it is the root of , whose coefficients (1 and −) are both real, but not of any polynomial with only rational coefficients. (The definition of the term transcendental number uses , not .)

== Properties ==

The following conditions are equivalent for an element formula_5 of an extension field formula_3 of formula_2:
* formula_5 is algebraic over formula_2,
* the field extension formula_10 is algebraic, i.e. &quot;every&quot; element of formula_11 is algebraic over formula_2 (here formula_11 denotes the smallest subfield of formula_3 containing formula_2 and formula_5),
* the field extension formula_10 has finite degree, i.e. the dimension of formula_11 as a formula_2-vector space is finite,
* formula_20, where formula_21 is the set of all elements of formula_3 that can be written in the form formula_23 with a polynomial formula_24 whose coefficients lie in formula_2.

To make this more explicit, consider the polynomial evaluation formula_26. This is a homomorphism and its kernel is formula_27. If formula_5 is algebraic, this ideal contains non-zero polynomials, but as formula_29 is a euclidean domain, it contains a unique polynomial formula_30 with minimal degree and leading coefficient formula_31, which then also generates the ideal and must be irreducible. The polynomial formula_30 is called the minimal polynomial of formula_5 and it encodes many important properties of formula_5. Hence the ring isomorphism formula_35 obtained by the homomorphism theorem is an isomorphism of fields, where we can then observe that formula_36. Otherwise, formula_37 is injective and hence we obtain a field isomorphism formula_38, where formula_39 is the field of fractions of formula_29, i.e. the field of rational functions on formula_2, by the universal property of the field of fractions. We can conclude that in any case, we find an isomorphism formula_42 or formula_43. Investigating this construction yields the desired results.

This characterization can be used to show that the sum, difference, product and quotient of algebraic elements over formula_2 are again algebraic over formula_2. For if formula_5 and formula_47 are both algebraic, then formula_48 is finite. As it contains the aforementioned combinations of formula_5 and formula_47, adjoining one of them to formula_2 also yields a finite extension, and therefore these elements are algebraic as well. Thus set of all elements of formula_3 that are algebraic over formula_2 is a field that sits in between formula_3 and formula_2. 

Fields that do not allow any algebraic elements over them (except their own elements) are called algebraically closed. The field of complex numbers is an example. If formula_3 is algebraically closed, then the field of algebraic elements of formula_3 over formula_2 is algebraically closed, which can again be directly shown using the characterisation of simple algebraic extensions above. An example for this is the field of algebraic numbers.

<text>John Davison Rockefeller Sr. (July 8, 1839 – May 23, 1937) was an American businessman and philanthropist. He was one of the wealthiest Americans of all time and one of the richest people in modern history. Rockefeller was born into a large family in Upstate New York who moved several times before eventually settling in Cleveland, Ohio. He became an assistant bookkeeper at age 16 and went into several business partnerships beginning at age 20, concentrating his business on oil refining. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Company in 1870. He ran it until 1897 and remained its largest shareholder. In his retirement, he focused his energy and wealth on philanthropy, especially regarding education, medicine, higher education, and modernizing the Southern United States.

Rockefeller&#x27;s wealth soared as kerosene and gasoline grew in importance, and he became the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak in 1900. Oil was used in lamps, and as a fuel for ships and automobiles. Standard Oil was the greatest business trust in the United States. Through use of the company&#x27;s monopoly power, Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry and, through corporate and technological innovations, was instrumental in both widely disseminating and drastically reducing the production cost of oil. 

Rockefeller&#x27;s company and business practices came under criticism, particularly in the writings of author Ida Tarbell. The Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that Standard Oil must be dismantled for violation of federal antitrust laws. It was broken up into 34 separate entities, which included companies that became ExxonMobil, Chevron Corporation, and others—some of which remain among the largest companies by revenue worldwide. Consequently, Rockefeller became the country&#x27;s first billionaire, with a fortune worth nearly 2% of the national economy. His personal wealth was estimated in 1913 at $900 million, which was almost 3% of the US gross domestic product (GDP) of $39.1 billion that year.

Rockefeller spent much of the last 40 years of his life in retirement at Kykuit, his estate in Westchester County, New York, defining the structure of modern philanthropy, along with other key industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie. His fortune was used chiefly to create the modern systematic approach of targeted philanthropy through the creation of foundations that supported medicine, education, and scientific research. His foundations pioneered developments in medical research and were instrumental in the near-eradication of hookworm in the American South, and yellow fever in the United States. He and Carnegie gave form and impetus through their charities to the work of Abraham Flexner, who in his essay &quot;Medical Education in America&quot; emphatically endowed empiricism as the basis for the US medical system of the 20th century.

Rockefeller was the founder of the University of Chicago and Rockefeller University, and funded the establishment of Central Philippine University in the Philippines. He was a devout Northern Baptist and supported many church-based institutions. He adhered to total abstinence from alcohol and tobacco throughout his life. For advice, he relied closely on his wife, Laura Spelman Rockefeller; they had four daughters and a son together. He was a faithful congregant of the Erie Street Baptist Mission Church, taught Sunday school, and served as a trustee, clerk, and occasional janitor. Religion was a guiding force throughout his life, and he believed it to be the source of his success. Rockefeller was also considered a supporter of capitalism based on a perspective of social Darwinism, and he was quoted often as saying, &quot;The growth of a large business is merely a survival of the fittest.&quot;

==Early life==

Rockefeller was the second of six children born in Richford, New York, to con artist William A. Rockefeller Sr. and Eliza Davison. Rockefeller had an elder sister named Lucy and four younger siblings: William Jr., Mary, and fraternal twins Franklin (Frank) and Frances. His father was of English and German descent, while his mother was of Ulster Scot descent. One source says that some ancestors were Huguenots, the Roquefeuille family, who fled to Germany from France during the reign of Louis XIV and a period of religious persecution. By the time their descendants immigrated to North America, their name had taken German form. William Sr. worked first as a lumberman and then a traveling salesman. He claimed to be a &quot;botanic physician&quot; who sold elixirs, and was described by locals as &quot;Big Bill&quot; and &quot;Devil Bill.&quot; Unshackled by conventional morality, he led a vagabond existence and returned to his family infrequently. Throughout his life, Bill was notorious for conducting schemes. In between the births of Lucy and John, Bill and his mistress and housekeeper Nancy Brown had a daughter named Clorinda, who died young. Between John and William Jr.&#x27;s births, Bill and Nancy had another daughter, named Cornelia.

Eliza was a homemaker and a devout Baptist who struggled to maintain a semblance of stability at home, as Bill was frequently gone for extended periods. She also put up with his philandering and his double life, which included bigamy. He permanently abandoned his family around 1855 and lived with second wife, Margaret L. Allen. 

Eliza was thrifty by nature and by necessity, and she taught her son that &quot;willful waste makes woeful want&quot;. John did his share of the regular household chores and earned extra money raising turkeys, selling potatoes and candy, and eventually lending small sums of money to neighbors. He followed his father&#x27;s advice to &quot;trade dishes for platters&quot; and always get the better part of any deal. Bill once bragged, &quot;I cheat my boys every chance I get. I want to make &#x27;em sharp.&quot; However, his mother was more influential in John&#x27;s upbringing and beyond, while he distanced himself further and further from his father as his life progressed. He later stated, &quot;From the beginning, I was trained to work, to save, and to give.&quot;

When he was a boy, his family moved to Moravia, New York, and to Owego, New York, in 1851, where he attended Owego Academy. In 1853, his family moved to Strongsville, Ohio, and he attended Cleveland&#x27;s Central High School, the first high school in Cleveland and the first free public high school west of the Alleghenies. Then he took a ten-week business course at Folsom&#x27;s Commercial College, where he studied bookkeeping. Rockefeller was a well-behaved, serious, and studious boy despite his father&#x27;s absences and frequent family moves. His contemporaries described him as reserved, earnest, religious, methodical, and discreet. He was an excellent debater and expressed himself precisely. He also had a deep love of music and dreamed of it as a possible career.

==Pre-Standard Oil career==
===As a bookkeeper===
In September 1855, when Rockefeller was sixteen, he got his first job as an assistant bookkeeper working for a small produce commission firm in Cleveland called Hewitt &amp; Tuttle. He worked long hours and delighted, as he later recalled, in &quot;all the methods and systems of the office.&quot; He was particularly adept at calculating transportation costs, which served him well later in his career. Much of Rockefeller&#x27;s duties involved negotiating with barge canal owners, ship captains, and freight agents. In these negotiations, he learned that posted transportation rates that were believed to be fixed could be altered depending on conditions and timing of freight and through the use of rebates to preferred shippers. Rockefeller was also given the duties of collecting debts when Hewitt instructed him to do so. Instead of using his father&#x27;s method of presence to collect debts, Rockefeller relied on a persistent pestering approach. Rockefeller received $16 a month for his three-month apprenticeship. During his first year, he received $31 a month, which was increased to $50 a month. His final year provided him $58 a month.

As a youth, Rockefeller reportedly said that his two great ambitions were to make $100,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars) and to live 100 years.

===Business partnership and Civil War service===

In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with two partners, Maurice B. Clark and George W. Gardner, under Clark, Gardner &amp; Company, and they raised $4,000 ($ in dollars) in capital. Clark initiated the idea of the partnership and offered $2,000 towards the goal. Rockefeller had only $800 saved up at the time and so borrowed $1,000 from his father, &quot;Big Bill&quot; Rockefeller, at 10 percent interest. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. In their first and second years of business, Clark, Gardner &amp; Rockefeller netted $4,400 (on nearly half a million dollars in business) and $17,000 worth of profit, respectively, and their profits soared with the outbreak of the American Civil War when the Union Army called for massive amounts of food and supplies. During the second year of the American Civil War, Gardner withdrew from the business, and the firm became Clark &amp; Rockefeller. 

When the Civil War was nearing a close and with the prospect of those war-time profits ending, Clark &amp; Rockefeller looked toward the refining of crude oil. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. &quot;I wanted to go in the army and do my part,&quot; Rockefeller said. &quot;But it was simply out of the question. There was no one to take my place. We were in a new business, and if I had not stayed it must have stopped—and with so many dependent on it.&quot;

Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, &quot;God gave me money&quot;, and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley&#x27;s dictum, &quot;gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.&quot; During the Civil War, military consumption of oil drove the price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.

A market existed for the refined oil in the form of kerosene. Coal had previously been used to extract kerosene, but its tedious extraction process and high price prevented broad use. Even with the high costs of freight transportation and a government levy during the Civil War (the government levied a tax of twenty cents a gallon on refined oil), profits on the refined product were large. The price of the refined oil in 1863 was around $13 a barrel, with a profit margin of around $5 to $8 a barrel. The capital expenditures for a refinery at that time were small – around $1,000 to $1,500 and requiring only a few men to operate. In this environment of a wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in &quot;The Flats&quot;, then Cleveland&#x27;s burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark &amp; Company, which was composed of Clark &amp; Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark&#x27;s two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed.

While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller used the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and sold the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller&#x27;s refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $0.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself. In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a &quot;critical&quot; action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for $72,500 (equivalent to $ in dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller &amp; Andrews. Rockefeller said, &quot;It was the day that determined my career.&quot; He was well-positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.

===Beginning in the oil business===
In 1866, William Rockefeller Jr., John&#x27;s brother, built another refinery in Cleveland and brought John into the partnership. In 1867, Henry Morrison Flagler became a partner, and the firm of Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler was established. By 1868, with Rockefeller continuing practices of borrowing and reinvesting profits, controlling costs, and using refineries&#x27; waste, the company owned two Cleveland refineries and a marketing subsidiary in New York; it was the largest oil refinery in the world. Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler was the predecessor of the Standard Oil Company.

==Standard Oil==
===Founding and early growth===

By the end of the American Civil War, Cleveland was one of the five main refining centers in the U.S. (besides Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, New York, and the region in northwestern Pennsylvania where most of the oil originated). By 1869 there was triple the kerosene refining capacity than needed to supply the market, and the capacity remained in excess for many years.

On January 10, 1870, Rockefeller abolished the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler, co-founding Standard Oil of Ohio. Continuing to apply his work ethic and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company to be the most profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.

Part of this scheme was the announcement of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a firestorm of protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, which led to the discovery of Standard Oil&#x27;s part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel&#x27;s charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller&#x27;s efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. During the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.

Undeterred, though vilified for the first time by the press, Rockefeller continued with his self-reinforcing cycle of buying the least efficient competing refiners, improving the efficiency of his operations, pressing for discounts on oil shipments, undercutting his competition, making secret deals, raising investment pools, and buying rivals out. In less than four months in 1872, in what was later known as &quot;The Cleveland Conquest&quot; or &quot;The Cleveland Massacre&quot;, Standard Oil absorbed 22 of its 26 Cleveland competitors. Eventually, even his former antagonists, Pratt and Rogers, saw the futility of continuing to compete against Standard Oil; in 1874, they made a secret agreement with Rockefeller to be acquired.

Pratt and Rogers became Rockefeller&#x27;s partners. Rogers, in particular, became one of Rockefeller&#x27;s key men in the formation of the Standard Oil Trust. Pratt&#x27;s son, Charles Millard Pratt, became secretary of Standard Oil. For many of his competitors, Rockefeller had merely to show them his books so they could see what they were up against and then make them a decent offer. If they refused his offer, he told them he would run them into bankruptcy and then cheaply buy up their assets at auction. However, he did not intend to eliminate competition entirely. In fact, his partner Pratt said of that accusation &quot;Competitors we must have ... If we absorb them, it surely will bring up another.&quot;

Instead of wanting to eliminate them, Rockefeller saw himself as the industry&#x27;s savior, &quot;an angel of mercy&quot; absorbing the weak and making the industry as a whole stronger, more efficient, and more competitive. Standard was growing horizontally and vertically. It added its own pipelines, tank cars, and home delivery network. It kept oil prices low to stave off competitors, made its products affordable to the average household, and, to increase market penetration, sometimes sold below cost. It developed over 300 oil-based products from tar to paint to petroleum jelly to chewing gum. By the end of the 1870s, Standard was refining over 90% of the oil in the U.S. Rockefeller had already become a millionaire ($1 million is equivalent to $ in dollars).

In 1877, Standard clashed with Thomas A. Scott, the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, Standard&#x27;s chief hauler. Rockefeller envisioned pipelines as an alternative transport system for oil and began a campaign to build and acquire them. The railroad, seeing Standard&#x27;s incursion into the transportation and pipeline fields, struck back and formed a subsidiary to buy and build oil refineries and pipelines.

Standard countered, held back its shipments, and, with the help of other railroads, started a price war that dramatically reduced freight payments and caused labor unrest. Rockefeller prevailed and the railroad sold its oil interests to Standard. In the aftermath of that battle, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania indicted Rockefeller in 1879 on charges of monopolizing the oil trade, starting an avalanche of similar court proceedings in other states and making a national issue of Standard Oil&#x27;s business practices. Rockefeller was under great strain during the 1870s and 1880s when he was carrying out his plan of consolidation and integration and being attacked by the press. He complained that he could not stay asleep most nights. Rockefeller later commented:

All the fortune that I have made has not served to compensate me for the anxiety of that period.

===Monopoly===

Although it always had hundreds of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales &quot;as market share&quot; in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% over the life of the company), Standard Oil&#x27;s business practices created intense controversy. Standard&#x27;s most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.

The firm was attacked by journalists and politicians throughout its existence, in part for these monopolistic methods, giving momentum to the antitrust movement. In 1879, the New York State Legislature&#x27;s Hepburn Committee investigations into &quot;alleged abuses&quot; committed by the railroads uncovered the fact that Standard Oil was receiving substantial freight rebates on all of the oil it was transporting by railroad—and was crushing Standard&#x27;s competitors thereby. By 1880, according to the &quot;New York World&quot;, Standard Oil was &quot;the most cruel, impudent, pitiless, and grasping monopoly that ever fastened upon a country&quot;. To critics, Rockefeller replied, &quot;In a business so large as ours ... some things are likely to be done which we cannot approve. We correct them as soon as they come to our knowledge.&quot;

At that time, many legislatures had made it difficult to incorporate in one state and operate in another. As a result, Rockefeller and his associates owned dozens of separate corporations, each of which operated in just one state; the management of the whole enterprise was rather unwieldy. In 1882, Rockefeller&#x27;s lawyers created an innovative form of corporation to centralize their holdings, giving birth to the Standard Oil Trust. The &quot;trust&quot; was a corporation of corporations, and the entity&#x27;s size and wealth drew much attention. Nine trustees, including Rockefeller, ran the 41 companies in the trust. The public and the press were immediately suspicious of this new legal entity, and other businesses seized upon the idea and emulated it, further inflaming public sentiment. Standard Oil had gained an aura of invincibility, always prevailing against competitors, critics, and political enemies. It had become the richest, biggest, most feared business in the world, seemingly immune to the boom and bust of the business cycle, consistently making profits year after year.
The company&#x27;s vast American empire included 20,000 domestic wells, 4,000 miles of pipeline, 5,000 tank cars, and over 100,000 employees. Its share of world oil refining topped out above 90% but slowly dropped to about 80% for the rest of the century. Despite the formation of the trust and its perceived immunity from all competition, by the 1880s Standard Oil had passed its peak of power over the world oil market. Rockefeller finally gave up his dream of controlling all the world&#x27;s oil refining; he admitted later, &quot;We realized that public sentiment would be against us if we actually refined all the oil.&quot; Over time, foreign competition and new finds abroad eroded his dominance. In the early 1880s, Rockefeller created one of his most important innovations. Rather than try to influence the price of crude oil directly, Standard Oil had been exercising indirect control by altering oil storage charges to suit market conditions. Rockefeller then ordered the issuance of certificates against oil stored in its pipelines. These certificates became traded by speculators, thus creating the first oil-futures market which effectively set spot market prices from then on. The National Petroleum Exchange opened in Manhattan in late 1882 to facilitate the trading of oil futures.

Although 85% of world crude production was still coming from Pennsylvania in the 1880s, oil from wells drilled in Russia and Asia began to reach the world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper Russian oil fields, including the region&#x27;s first pipeline and the world&#x27;s first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, the invention of the light bulb gradually began to erode the dominance of kerosene for illumination. Standard Oil adapted by developing a European presence, expanding into natural gas production in the U.S., and then producing gasoline for automobiles, which until then had been considered a waste product.
Standard Oil moved its headquarters to New York City at 26 Broadway, and Rockefeller became a central figure in the city&#x27;s business community. He bought a residence in 1884 on 54th Street near the mansions of other magnates such as William Henry Vanderbilt. Despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity, Rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily. In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, but by then Standard depended more on pipeline transport. More threatening to Standard&#x27;s power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to the breakup of the Standard Oil trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state antitrust laws, and finally forced a separation of Standard Oil of Ohio from the rest of the company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.
In the 1890s, Rockefeller expanded into iron ore and ore transportation, forcing a collision with steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and their competition became a major subject of the newspapers and cartoonists. He went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, as the original Pennsylvania oil fields began to play out. Amid the frenetic expansion, Rockefeller began to think of retirement. The daily management of the trust was turned over to John Dustin Archbold and Rockefeller bought a new estate, Pocantico Hills, north of New York City, turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf.

Upon his ascent to the presidency, Theodore Roosevelt initiated dozens of suits under the Sherman Antitrust Act and coaxed reforms out of Congress. In 1901, U.S. Steel, then controlled by J. Pierpont Morgan, having bought Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s steel assets, offered to buy Standard&#x27;s iron interests as well. A deal brokered by Henry Clay Frick exchanged Standard&#x27;s iron interests for U.S. Steel stock and gave Rockefeller and his son membership on the company&#x27;s board of directors. In full retirement at age 63, Rockefeller earned over $58 million (~$ in ) in investments in 1902.
One of the most effective attacks on Rockefeller and his firm was the 1904 publication of &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company,&quot; by Ida Tarbell, a leading muckraker. She documented the company&#x27;s espionage, price wars, heavy-handed marketing tactics, and courtroom evasions. Although her work prompted a huge backlash against the company, Tarbell stated she was surprised at its magnitude. &quot;I never had an animus against their size and wealth, never objected to their corporate form. I was willing that they should combine and grow as big and wealthy as they could, but only by legitimate means. But they had never played fair, and that ruined their greatness for me.&quot; Tarbell&#x27;s father had been driven out of the oil business during the &quot;South Improvement Company&quot; affair.
Rockefeller called her &quot;Miss Tarbarrel&quot; in private but held back in public saying only, &quot;not a word about that misguided woman.&quot; He began a publicity campaign to put his company and himself in a better light. Though he had long maintained a policy of active silence with the press, he decided to make himself more accessible and responded with conciliatory comments such as &quot;capital and labor are both wild forces which require intelligent legislation to hold them in restriction.&quot; He wrote and published his memoirs beginning in 1908. Critics found his writing to be sanitized and disingenuous and thought that statements such as &quot;the underlying, essential element of success in business are to follow the established laws of high-class dealing&quot; seemed to be at odds with his true business methods.

Rockefeller and his son continued to consolidate their oil interests as best they could until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust in the form of a single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP. Pennzoil and Chevron have remained separate companies.

Rockefeller, who had rarely sold shares, held over 25% of Standard&#x27;s stock at the time of the breakup. He and all of the other stockholders received proportionate shares in each of the 34 companies. In the aftermath, Rockefeller&#x27;s control over the oil industry was somewhat reduced, but over the next 10 years the breakup proved immensely profitable for him. The companies&#x27; combined net worth rose fivefold and Rockefeller&#x27;s personal wealth jumped to $900 million.

==Colorado Fuel and Iron==
In 1902, facing cash flow problems, John Cleveland Osgood turned to George Jay Gould, a principal stockholder of the Denver and Rio Grande, for a loan. Gould, via Frederick Taylor Gates, Rockefeller&#x27;s financial adviser, brought John D. Rockefeller in to help finance the loan. Analysis of the company&#x27;s operations by John D. Rockefeller Jr. showed a need for substantially more funds which were provided in exchange for acquisition of CF&amp;I&#x27;s subsidiaries such as the Colorado and Wyoming Railway Company, the Crystal River Railroad Company, and possibly the Rocky Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Control was passed from the Iowa Group to Gould and Rockefeller interests in 1903 with Gould in control and Rockefeller and Gates representing a minority interests. Osgood left the company in 1904 and devoted his efforts to operating competing coal and coke operations.

===Strike of 1913–14 and the Ludlow Massacre===

The strike, called in September 1913 by the United Mine Workers over the issue of union representation, was against coal mine operators in Huerfano and Las Animas counties of southern Colorado, where the majority of CF&amp;I&#x27;s coal and coke production was located. The strike was fought vigorously by the coal mine operators association and its steering committee, which included Welborn, president of CF&amp;I, a spokesman for the coal operators. Rockefeller&#x27;s operative, Lamont Montgomery Bowers, remained in the background. Few miners belonged to the union or participated in the strike call, but the majority honored it. Strikebreakers (called &quot;scabs&quot;) were threatened and sometimes attacked. Both sides purchased substantial arms and ammunition. Striking miners were forced to abandon their homes in company towns and lived in tent cities erected by the union, such as the tent city at Ludlow, a railway stop north of Trinidad.

Under the protection of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protected their movements. In February 1914, a substantial portion of the troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado.

Due to reduced demand for coal, resulting from an economic downturn, many of CF&amp;I&#x27;s coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coalfields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.

The casualties suffered at Ludlow mobilized public opinion against the Rockefellers and the coal industry. The United States Commission on Industrial Relations conducted extensive hearings, singling out John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Rockefellers&#x27; relationship with Bowers for special attention. Bowers was relieved of duty and Wellborn restored to control in 1915, then industrial relations improved. 

Rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized the seriousness of the event. When testifying on the Ludlow Massacre, and asked what action he would have taken as Director, John D. Rockefeller Jr. stated, &quot;I would have taken no action. I would have deplored the necessity which compelled the officers of the company to resort to such measures to supplement the State forces to maintain law and order.&quot; He admitted that he had made no attempt to bring the militiamen to justice.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Against long-circulating speculations that his family has French roots, genealogists proved the German origin of Rockefeller and traced them to the early 17th century. &quot;Johann Peter Rockenfeller&quot; (baptized September 27, 1682, in the Protestant church of Rengsdorf) immigrated in 1723 from Altwied (today a district of Neuwied, Rhineland-Palatinate) with three children to North America. He settled in Germantown, Pennsylvania.

The name Rockenfeller refers to the now-abandoned village of Rockenfeld in the district of Neuwied.

===Marriage===
In 1864, Rockefeller married Laura Celestia &quot;Cettie&quot; Spelman (1839–1915), daughter of Harvey Buell Spelman and Lucy Henry. They had four daughters and one son together. He said later, &quot;Her judgment was always better than mine. Without her keen advice, I would be a poor man.&quot;
* Elizabeth &quot;Bessie&quot; Rockefeller (August 23, 1866 – November 14, 1906)
* Alice Rockefeller (July 14, 1869 – August 20, 1870)
* Alta Rockefeller (April 12, 1871 – June 21, 1962)
* Edith Rockefeller (August 31, 1872 – August 25, 1932)
* John Davison Rockefeller Jr. (January 29, 1874 – May 11, 1960)
The Rockefeller wealth, distributed as it was through a system of foundations and trusts, continued to fund family philanthropic, commercial, and, eventually, political aspirations throughout the 20th century. John Jr.&#x27;s youngest son David Rockefeller was a leading New York banker, serving for over 20 years as CEO of Chase Manhattan (now part of JPMorgan Chase). Second son Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller was Republican governor of New York and the 41st Vice President of the United States. Fourth son Winthrop Aldrich Rockefeller served as Republican Governor of Arkansas. Grandchildren Abigail Aldrich &quot;Abby&quot; Rockefeller and John Davison Rockefeller III became philanthropists. Grandson Laurance Spelman Rockefeller became a conservationist. Great-grandson John Davison &quot;Jay&quot; Rockefeller IV served from 1985 until 2015 as a Democratic Senator from West Virginia after serving as governor of West Virginia, and another Winthrop served as lieutenant governor of Arkansas for a decade.

===Religious views===

John D. Rockefeller was born in Richford, New York, then part of the Burned-over district, a New York state region that became the site of an evangelical revival known as the Second Great Awakening. It drew masses to various Protestant churches—especially Baptist ones—and urged believers to follow such ideals as hard work, prayer, and good deeds to build &quot;the Kingdom of God on Earth.&quot; Early in his life, he regularly went with his siblings and mother Eliza to the local Baptist church—the Erie Street Baptist Church (later the Euclid Avenue Baptist Church)—an independent Baptist church that eventually associated with the Northern Baptist Convention (1907–1950; now part of the modern American Baptist Churches USA).

His mother was deeply religious and disciplined, and had a major influence on him in religious matters. During church service, his mother would urge him to contribute his few pennies to the congregation. Rockefeller associated the church with charity. A Baptist preacher once encouraged him to &quot;make as much money as he could, and then give away as much as he could&quot;. Later in his life, Rockefeller recalled: &quot;It was at this moment, that the financial plan of my life was formed&quot;. Money making was considered by him a &quot;God-given gift&quot;.

A devout Northern Baptist, Rockefeller would read the Bible daily, attend prayer meetings twice a week and led his own Bible study with his wife. Burton Folsom Jr. has noted:

Rockefeller would support Baptist missionary activity, fund universities, and deeply engage in religious activities at his Cleveland, Ohio, church. While traveling the South, he would donate large sums of money to churches belonging to the Southern Baptist Convention, various Black churches, and other Christian denominations. He paid toward the freedom of two slaves and donated to a Roman Catholic orphanage. As he grew rich, his donations became more generous, especially to his church in Cleveland. Believed to be obsolescent, the church was demolished in 1925, and replaced with a new building.

==Philanthropy==
Rockefeller&#x27;s charitable giving began with his first job as a clerk at age 16, when he gave six percent of his earnings to charity, as recorded in his personal ledger. By the time he was twenty, his charity exceeded ten percent of his income. Much of his giving was church-related. His church was later affiliated with the Northern Baptist Convention, which formed from American Baptists in the North with ties to their historic missions to establish schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the American Civil War. Rockefeller attended Baptist churches every Sunday; when traveling he would often attend services at African-American Baptist congregations, leaving a substantial donation. As Rockefeller&#x27;s wealth grew, so did his giving, primarily to educational and public health causes, but also for basic science and the arts. He was advised primarily by Frederick Taylor Gates after 1891, and, after 1897, also by his son.

Rockefeller believed in the Efficiency Movement, arguing that: &quot;To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste ... it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end.&quot;

Rockefeller and his advisers invented the conditional grant, which required the recipient to &quot;root the institution in the affections of as many people as possible who, as contributors, become personally concerned, and thereafter may be counted on to give to the institution their watchful interest and cooperation&quot;.

In 1884, Rockefeller provided major funding for Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary in Atlanta for African-American women. His wife, Laura Spelman Rockefeller, was dedicated to civil rights and equality for women. John and Laura donated money and supported the Atlanta Baptist Female Seminary whose mission was in line with their faith based beliefs. Today known as Spelman College, the school is an all women Historically Black College or University in Atlanta, Georgia, named after Laura&#x27;s family. The Spelman Family, Rockefeller&#x27;s in-laws, along with John Rockefeller were ardent abolitionists before the Civil War and were dedicated to supporting the Underground Railroad. John Rockefeller was impressed by the vision of the school and removed the debt from the school. The oldest existing building on Spelman&#x27;s campus, Rockefeller Hall, is named after him. Rockefeller also gave considerable donations to Denison University and other Baptist colleges.

Rockefeller gave $80 million (~$ in ) to the University of Chicago under William Rainey Harper, turning a small Baptist college into a world-class institution by 1900. He would describe the University of Chicago as &quot;the best investment I ever made.&quot; He also gave a grant to the American Baptist Missionaries foreign mission board, the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society in establishing Central Philippine University, the first Baptist and second American university in Asia, in 1905 in the heavily Catholic Philippines.

Rockefeller&#x27;s General Education Board, founded in 1903, was established to promote education at all levels everywhere in the country. In keeping with the historic missions of the Baptists, it was especially active in supporting black schools in the South. Rockefeller also provided financial support to such established eastern institutions as Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Bryn Mawr, Wellesley and Vassar.
On Gates&#x27; advice, Rockefeller became one of the first great benefactors of medical science. In 1901, he founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York City. It changed its name to Rockefeller University in 1965, after expanding its mission to include graduate education. It claims a connection to 23 Nobel laureates. He founded the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission in 1909, an organization that eventually eradicated the hookworm disease, which had long plagued rural areas of the American South. His General Education Board made a dramatic impact by funding the recommendations of the &quot;Flexner Report&quot; of 1910. The study, an excerpt of which was published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, had been undertaken by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

Rockefeller created the Rockefeller Foundation in 1913 to continue and expand the scope of the work of the Sanitary Commission, which was closed in 1915. He gave $182 million to the foundation, which focused on public health, medical training, and the arts. It endowed Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, the first of its kind. It also built the Peking Union Medical College in China into a notable institution. The foundation helped in World War I war relief, and it employed William Lyon Mackenzie King of Canada to study industrial relations.

In the 1920s, the Rockefeller Foundation funded a hookworm eradication campaign through the International Health Division. This campaign used a combination of politics and science, along with collaboration between healthcare workers and government officials to accomplish its goals.

Rockefeller&#x27;s fourth main philanthropy, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Foundation, was created in 1918. Through this, he supported work in the social studies; this was later absorbed into the Rockefeller Foundation. In total Rockefeller donated about $530 million.

Rockefeller became well known in his later life for the practice of giving dimes to adults and nickels to children wherever he went. He even gave dimes as a playful gesture to wealthy men, such as tire mogul Harvey Firestone.

Rockefeller supported the passage of the 18th Amendment, which banned alcohol in the United States. He wrote in a letter to Nicholas Murray Butler on June 6, 1932, that neither Rockefeller nor his parents or his father&#x27;s father and mother&#x27;s mother drank alcohol. In the same letter, Rockefeller writes that he has &quot;always stood for whatever measure seemed at the time to give promise of promoting temperance.&quot; He believed that measure to be prohibition, as he and his father donated $350,000 to &quot;all branches of the Anti-Saloon League, Federal and State.&quot; But by 1932, Rockefeller felt disillusioned by prohibition because of its failure to discourage drinking and alcoholism. He supported the incorporation of repealing the 18th amendment into the Republican party platform.

==Florida home==

Henry Morrison Flagler, one of the co-founders of Standard Oil along with Rockefeller, bought the Ormond Hotel in 1890, located in Ormond Beach, Florida, two years after it opened. Flagler expanded it to accommodate 600 guests and the hotel soon became one in a series of Gilded Age hotels catering to passengers aboard Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railway. One of Flagler&#x27;s guests at the Ormond Hotel was his former business partner John D. Rockefeller, who first stayed at the hotel in 1914.

Rockefeller liked the Ormond Beach area so much that after four seasons at the hotel, he bought an estate in Ormond Beach called The Casements in 1918. Rockefeller was seventy-eight years old when he moved into the Casements. He became known in the area for his elaborate Christmas parties, his love of golf, and for handing out dimes to his neighbors or visitors. During a golf game with Harvey Firestone, the tire magnate made such a good shot that Rockefeller decided he deserved a dime and handed one to his somewhat embarrassed guest. 

In 1923, Rockefeller was interviewed by early 20th century American woman writer and a member of the Newspaper Enterprise Association staff, Josephine Van De Grift. Nationwide newspapers sent Van De Grift to spend a week with Rockefeller candidly asking humble questions, taking strolls together, asking about golf, church, and day-to-day life, while staying across the street from him at the Ormond Hotel. She later recounts how readers were only interested in his pocketbook and not about his thoughts on golf or religion. The Casements would be Rockefeller&#x27;s winter home during the latter part of his life. 

Sold by his heirs in 1939, it was purchased by the city in 1974 and now serves as a cultural center and is the community&#x27;s best-known historical structure.

==Illnesses and death==

In his 50s, Rockefeller suffered from moderate depression and digestive troubles; during a stressful period in the 1890s he developed alopecia, the loss of some or all body hair.
By 1901 he began wearing toupées and by 1902, his mustache disappeared. His hair never grew back, but other health complaints subsided as he lightened his workload.
Rockefeller died of arteriosclerosis on May 23, 1937, less than two months shy of his 98th birthday, at &quot;The Casements&quot;, his home in Ormond Beach, Florida. He was buried in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland.

==Legacy==
Rockefeller had a long and controversial career in the oil industry followed by a long career in philanthropy. His image is an amalgam of all of these experiences and the many ways he was viewed by his contemporaries. These contemporaries include his former competitors, many of whom were driven to ruin, but many others of whom sold out at a profit (or a profitable stake in Standard Oil, as Rockefeller often offered his shares as payment for a business), and quite a few of whom became very wealthy as managers as well as owners in Standard Oil. They include politicians and writers, some of whom served Rockefeller&#x27;s interests, and some of whom built their careers by fighting Rockefeller and the &quot;robber barons&quot;.

Biographer Allan Nevins, answering Rockefeller&#x27;s enemies, concluded:

Hostile critics often portrayed Rockefeller as a villain with a suite of bad traits—ruthless, unscrupulous and greedy—and as a bully who connived his cruel path to dominance. Economic historian Robert Whaples warns against ignoring the secrets of his business success:

[R]elentless cost cutting and efficiency improvements, boldness in betting on the long-term prospects of the industry while others were willing to take quick profits, and impressive abilities to spot and reward talent, delegate tasks, and manage a growing empire.

Biographer Ron Chernow wrote of Rockefeller:

===Wealth===
Rockefeller is largely remembered simply for the raw size of his wealth. In 1902, an audit showed Rockefeller was worth about $200 million—compared to the total national GDP of $24 billion then.

His wealth continued to grow significantly (in line with U.S. economic growth) as the demand for gasoline soared, eventually reaching about $900 million on the eve of the First World War, including significant interests in banking, shipping, mining, railroads, and other industries. His personal wealth was 900 million in 1913 worth 23.5 billion dollars adjusted for inflation in 2020. According to his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, &quot;it was estimated after Mr. Rockefeller retired from business that he had accumulated close to $1,500,000,000 out of the earnings of the Standard Oil trust and out of his other investments. This was probably the greatest amount of wealth that any private citizen had ever been able to accumulate by his own efforts.&quot; By the time of his death in 1937, Rockefeller&#x27;s remaining fortune, largely tied up in permanent family trusts, was estimated at $1.4 billion, while the total national GDP was $92 billion. According to some methods of wealth calculation, Rockefeller&#x27;s net worth over the last decades of his life would easily place him as the wealthiest known person in recent history. As a percentage of the United States&#x27; GDP, no other American fortune—including those of Bill Gates or Sam Walton—would even come close.

Rockefeller, aged 86, wrote the following words to sum up his life:
