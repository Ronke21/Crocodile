<text>was a Japanese author, biologist, naturalist and ethnologist.

==Biography==
Minakata was born in Wakayama, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. In 1883, he moved to Tokyo, where he entered the preparatory school &quot;Kyōryū Gakkō&quot;. The headmaster of Kyōritsu, Takahashi Korekiyo, encouraged Minakata in his botanical studies, and stimulated his interest in the English language. The following year, Minakata passed the entrance exam to Tokyo University Preparatory School (Tokyo Daigaku Yobimon), counting among his classmates the novelist Natsume Sōseki.

At the end of 1886, Minakata set off to study in the United States. He arrived in San Francisco in January of the next year, and he studied there for about six months. He next went to Michigan State Agricultural College, where he was accepted, becoming the first Japanese to pass the entrance exam there. These were just the first steps, however, in Minakata&#x27;s unusually adventurous studies in various parts of the world, which would eventually include Cuba, Haiti, what is now Panama, Venezuela, and England, before returning to Japan.

In addition to his studies in slime moulds, Minakata was intensely interested in folklore, religion and natural history. He wrote several papers, including 51 monographs in &quot;Nature&quot;. He is known for discovering many varieties of mycetozoa.

Minakata had epilepsy, experiencing grand mal seizures. He was able to predict when he was about to have a seizure (as is common in epilepsy) due to a sense of déjà vu.

==Life==
Minakata Kumagusu came back to Japan in 1900 after 14 years of unique study experience abroad mainly in the U.S. and England. He settled in Wakayama Prefecture, his birthplace, until his death in 1941. He lived in Tanabe City from 1904 to 1941. Minakata devoted his entire life to studies of natural history and folklore, and contributed a number of articles to the British science magazine &quot;Nature&quot; and the British folklore magazine &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;. He was also involved in anti-shrine-consolidation protests and the nature conservation movement in Japan. He was respected as &quot;a great scholar with no degree&quot; and loved by the locals who called him Minakata Sensei (the teacher) or Minakata-san (Mr. Minakata), while branded by some as an oddball. More than 60 years after his death, Minakata&#x27;s achievements and life history has been made clear by a number of books and papers including &quot;The Complete Works of Minakata Kumagusu&quot; and &quot;The Diary of Minakata Kumagusu&quot;, and the research is still ongoing.

===Childhood and years in Tokyo===
Minakata Kumagusu was born in the castle city of Wakayama on April 15, 1867, the second son to a hardware dealer Yahei Minakata, 39, and wife Sumi, 30, and was raised with three brothers and two sisters. Since childhood, he had had extraordinary interests in the natural world and demonstrated a marvelous memory. As early as at the age of seven he transcribed an encyclopedia.

To develop his talent, Yahei, a self-made man, sent Minakata to the newly opened Wakayama Middle School (now Toin High), which was unconventional for a merchant family those days. Minakata&#x27;s thirst for knowledge was growing bigger as he at home recited the Chinese classics and transcribed the books that he had learned by heart at a collector&#x27;s place. That he transcribed &quot;Wakan Sansai Zue&quot;, an encyclopedia of 105 volumes, and &quot;Honzo Komoku&quot;, illustrated books of flora, in over five years is a famous episode from this period. At school, however, he remained a low achiever. He would finish lunch early and observe a frog or a crab in the empty lunch box.

After finishing middle school, he went to Tokyo in March 1883. The following year he entered the Preparatory School of Tokyo University. Among his colleagues were Masaoka Shiki, Natsume Sōseki, and Bimyo Yamada, who later became eminent figures of Japanese literature. Again Minakata was not interested in school and spent more time outside the university transcribing books in libraries, visiting zoos and botanic gardens, and collecting artifacts, animals, plants and minerals. At the news that Miles J. Berkeley, a world-famous British cryptogamist, and American botanist Moses A. Curtis had collected 6,000 species of fungi including slime molds, Minakata decided to produce an illustrated book that would cover more. In February 1886, following a failure at the end-of-year exam, he came home and told father that he would go to America. Initially opposed, Yahei finally gave in to his son&#x27;s enthusiasm and let him go.

===Years in the U.S.===
Minakata boarded the &quot;City of Beijing&quot; in Yokohama in December 1886. The next month the ship arrived in San Francisco, and he soon started to study at Pacific Business College just to experience American life (business was not his favorite subject).

In August 1887, he moved to Lansing, Michigan, and enrolled at the Michigan State School of Agriculture. One night in November 1888, however, he was in trouble for a drinking binge with a couple of Japanese and American friends in the dorm. He took the responsibility alone to save others from expulsion and early next morning left for Ann Arbor.

Minakata met bright Japanese students in Ann Arbor, the location of another state university. While keeping company with them, he stayed away from university and studied on his own by reading books and collecting plants in the mountains, particularly cryptogams including fungi and lichens. In October 1889, he read a biography of Conrad Gessner, a Swiss naturalist and a leading figure of modern biology, and swore he would become Japan&#x27;s Gessner, which was when his quest for the wonders of cryptogams began.

When he heard from William W. Calkins, a retired American colonel and a collector of lichens, that in Florida there were still many undiscovered plants, Minakata was ready to go. With two microscopes, books, a pistol, insect catchers as well as a medicine box and a plant press that he had just bought in Ann Arbor, Minakata went to Jacksonville in April 1891. He collected plants and animals while staying with Jiang, a supportive Chinese vegetable storekeeper. After three months enthusiastically collecting plants and animals, he moved to Key West, Florida, then to Havana, Cuba in mid-September.

After a month in Havana, a Japanese circus rider suddenly visited him. That encounter brought him to a new adventure of traveling in Port-au-Prince, Caracas, Valencia, and Jamaica with the circus working as a mahout&#x27;s hand. This enabled him to collect precious fungi and lichens in the West Indies. In January 1892 he returned to Jacksonville and worked on the plants he had collected in Florida and Cuba at Jiang&#x27;s. When Jiang wound up the business in August, Minakata moved to New York. In September he put an end to six years in America and got aboard the &quot;City of New York&quot; bound for the UK.

===Years in London===

After crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the ship arrived at Liverpool. In London, Minakata visited Yoshikusu Nakai, branch manager of the Yokohama Shokin Bank, an old friend of the Minakata family from Wakayama. The man handed him a letter from Tsunegusu, one of his younger brothers, about their beloved father&#x27;s death. Minakata was totally devastated.

He lived in downtown London where rents were cheap. While working on herbaria and exchanging specimens and letters with William W. Calkins and Allen, he visited the British Museum, the South Kensington Museum and other galleries. He then was introduced to Japanese Asian antique dealer Kataoka Prince. In August 1893, Minakata read in &quot;Nature&quot; magazine, his favorite since his time in U.S., a thesis titled &quot;Five articles about the composition of constellations.&quot; Its questions inspired him to write a reply.

Kataoka Prince, who had noticed the erudition of the shabby-looking man, introduced him to Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks, of the British Museum. Thereafter, Minakata visited the museum often to ask advice from Franks. Using a fragmented dictionary borrowed from his landlady, he completed an article titled &quot;The Constellations in the Far East&quot; in 30 days. The article was published in &quot;Nature&quot;, and he suddenly became known among the intelligentsia. He contributed regularly to the magazine after that and also started writing for &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;. He continued to contribute a number of articles and letters to the magazines after returning to Japan and won a reputation worldwide as an authority on Oriental studies.

His rising reputation opened the door to friendships with notable figures including Frederick. V. Dickins, registrar of the University of London, as well as people from the British Museum including Sir Robert K. Douglas, director of the Oriental Printed Books section and Charles H. Read, the successor to Franks. He visited the British Museum almost every day. While immersing himself in rare books of all ages from East and West, particularly in the fields of archeology, anthropology, folklore and religion, he copied them into notebooks. A collection of 52 thick notebooks from this period called &quot;London Extracts&quot; is kept in the Minakata residence and the Minakata Kumagusu Museum. The pages are densely covered with tiny letters he put in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Greek and Latin.

Douglas, who was impressed with his extensive knowledge, offered Minakata a job at the British Museum, but he declined the offer in light of freedom. Instead, he helped make a catalog of the books and manuscripts of the library and conducted historical research on the Buddhist statues of the museum using his expertise accumulated through reading and transcribing of a large number of books including classics and encyclopedia since childhood.

One of the highlights in London was getting to know Sun Yat-sen, father of the Chinese Revolution. Minakata put it in his diary how they hit it off straight away on first acquaintance at the Douglas&#x27;s office in the British Museum in March 1897 and quickly developed a friendship through visiting each other and talking until late almost every day. The descriptions, though very brief, reveal the closeness between two friends. Their company lasted only four months until Sun had to leave London for Asia in early July.

In October 1893 he met Toki Horyu, later the chief abbot of Kōyasan temple complex, a relationship that deserves special mention. Minakata and Toki, much senior to him, opened up to each other and exchanged frank opinions about religion. They wrote to each other until later years.

Many famous figures from Japan visited Minakata in London. They all were astonished at his erudition and shocked at his total lack of interest in daily life. Although highly regarded by some scholars, Minakata sometimes experienced discrimination because of his ethnicity, the cause for his frequent reckless behaviors leading up to the departure from the British Museum in December 1898. Frequent delay of money expected from the family in Japan forced him to take a job translating the titles for the calligraphy collection at the South Kensington Museum and sell ukiyoe with his friends. High hopes of becoming an assistant professor at the soon-to-be opened Japanology program in Cambridge or Oxford were gone when the plan was turned down. Forced into straitened circumstances, he made a decision in despair to leave the UK, where he had spent eight years. In September 1900, Minakata got on board the &quot;Awa Maru&quot; at the Thames and went home.

===The first year back home===

In October 1900, the &quot;Awa Maru&quot; arrived at Kobe after a 45-day voyage. Tsunegusu was shocked to see his elder brother appear in a shabby suit made of flimsy fabric like mosquito netting. He also was astounded Minakata had come back with tons of books and specimens but no degree. Minakata found temporary shelter at his brother&#x27;s in Wakayama.

After a while, Minakata heard that Sun Yat-sen was in the Yokohama settlement as a political refugee and wrote him. In February 1901 Sun came to Wakayama. Although the first reunion in four years was disturbed by a police detail, Sun was happy to take risks to see his old friend. As a gift, Sun left his favorite Panama hat. He later sent Minakata a reference letter addressed to Inukai Tsuyoshi, his guardian in Japan and later the prime minister. The letter, never used, is kept in the Minakata residence and the hat is on display in the Minakata Kumagusu Museum. Their friendship survived for a while; Sun sent specimens of lichen from Hawaii and Minakata wrote back, but ultimately they drifted apart and never met again. After Sun&#x27;s death, Minakata expressed his sorrow in the reminiscence and wrote: &quot;Friendship changes like seasons.&quot;

===Years in Nachi===
In October 1901 Minakata left Wakayama by boat for Katsu’ura, where he lived at the branch of Minakata Sake Distillery, run by brother Tsunegusu, until October 1904. In Nachi he spent all his time collecting fungi and algae around the region. One day, while collecting lichen at the Ichino-taki Falls, he met a young man, Shiro Koaze, a shipping company worker. Koaze, as a disciple, was going to help Minakata with research on slime molds all his life. Koaze sent specimens from every port he called as well as offered financial support. Koaze, with his close friend Shigeru Uematsu, backed Minakata materially and spiritually.

Minakata was very active in Nachi. He collected insects and plants, made microscope slides and colored illustrated manuals, read hundreds of books, completed a draft for the English translation of &quot;Hojoki: The Ten Square Feet Hut&quot; co-authored with Frederick Victor Dickins, and proofread &quot;Primal Text of Japan&quot; also by Dickins. He resumed writing for &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;. Embraced by the wildlife in the Kumano Mountains, Minakata, based on his extensive knowledge of the world, studied interaction between the spiritual with the material world, and participated in heated debates on nature and life, including religious one with Horyu Toki. He also completed &quot;The Origin of the Swallow-Stone Myth (Ensekiko)&quot;, a study he had planned at the end of the time in UK, that is considered the pinnacle of his research presented in English.

===Settled in Tanabe===
After three years and 21 months research on plants in the Kumano region, Kumagusu left Katsu&#x27;ura in October 1904 and walked to Tanabe, collecting specimens on his way. On arrival he immediately fell in love with Tanabe he thought was “a quiet place with nice people, cheap commodities and beautiful weather and the scenery.” He decided to settle, rented a house and started an easy life. He often invited friends and had parties at nearby luxury restaurants and teahouses; hired geishas, drank, sang Dodoitsu and Otsue, his favorite party pieces, and played strange performances.

In the fall of 1905 Minakata donated 46 specimens of slime molds to the British Museum. Arthur Lister, president of the British Mycological Society, had them introduced in the &quot;Journal of Botany&quot;, vol. 49, as &quot;The Second Report of Japanese Fungi,&quot; following the first report on the specimens sent by Prof. Miyoshi of Tokyo Imperial University. This article, which led Minakata to a new world of friendship with Lister and his daughter Gulielma, was a milestone in his career toward a world-class slime mold researcher.

In July 1906 at 40 Minakata married Matsue, 28, the fourth daughter of Munezo Tamura, chief priest of the Tokei Shrine. Tamura, a former samurai of the Kishu-Tokugawa clan, was also a Sinologist whose knowledge of Chinese wisdom had influenced Matsue&#x27;s upbringing. Her late marriage (for a woman in those days) was due to her devotion to father and the destitute family she had supported by teaching sewing and flower arrangement.

In July 1907 the couple had their first child, Kumaya. At first sight of his baby boy Minakata wrote: “Stayed awake till dawn watching my baby” and expressed the joy of becoming father. After the birth of Kumaya the marriage was rocky. After Matsue turned to her parents a few times, he gradually reduced alcohol. He kept in his diary every detail of Kumaya, how he moved and talked, which shows his deep love and expectations for his son. Minakata usually woke at 11 am and worked at home from sometime in the afternoon until 5 o’clock next morning sorting specimens, drawing pictures, conducting research, reading and writing. While weaving, Matsue, together with a housemaid, was very nervous about the care of weepy Kumaya. Their daughter Fumie was born in October 1911.

Minakata resumed copying books around in 1909. The extract of Daizokyo, scriptures owned by the Hōrin-ji Temple, which took full three years, was a particularly demanding job. “To read is to copy. You’ll forget when you just read it, but you’ll never forget when you copy it.” He propagated this belief and put it into practice by himself. The &quot;Tanabe Extracts&quot; from this period consist of 61 volumes. On top of the contributions he had made to British journals and magazines since coming home, Minakata started writing for journals and newspapers in Japan. Using a lot of citations was his signature style of research papers, but first-hand folklore evidence and antiquities were also included. He used his extraordinary memory and archives accumulated through interviews.

===Protests against shrine consolidation===

In 1906 the government imposed shrine consolidation regulations under which all shrines in a village or a town should be merged. The Wakayama prefectural government pushed hard for the enforcement of the regulations. In Japan there used to be a shrine in each community, however small, which was the centripetal force to unite the people, the provider of recreations and the object of worship, and with very few exceptions, they all stood in deep forests.

Minakata was worried that the consolidations would not only ruin historical buildings and antiquities but, by cutting trees, also damage the scenery and the natural life around them. He contributed an opinion to every edition of a local paper, &quot;Muro Shinpo&quot;. He also sent objection letters to major papers in Tokyo and Osaka and appealed to leading researchers for support, including Jinzo Matsumura, a notable botanist and professor of Tokyo University, to whom Minakata wrote long letters criticizing the deeds done by the central and prefectural governments. Yanagita Kunio, then a counselor of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau and later father of Japanese folklore, supported the campaign by disseminating copies of two letters as Minakata Nisho to those who concerned. He was also supported locally by a young Morihei Ueshiba.

In August 1910 Minakata was arrested for trespassing when he threw a bag of specimens into a meeting held in Tanabe Junior High School (now Tanabe High). Although drunk, he did it out of rage when not allowed to talk with one of the attendees, a government officer who was in charge of the promotion of the regulations. During 18 days in jail pending trial he read books and hunted slime molds in the building. When released, he refused to leave saying: “This place is quiet with no visitors and cool. I want to stay longer.” 

As his enthusiasm moved public opinion, the regulations gradually lost momentum. In 1920, 10 years from his arrest, the regulations were confirmed useless by the House of Peers and abolished. Ultimately, Minakata&#x27;s efforts saved a couple of forests, but a number of shrines and forests had become extinct during the decade. He then approached various social movements and public bodies in charge of the national heritage list in order to promote protection of the precious environment including the Kashima Island in Tanabe Bay. His battle continued until his last years, which is why he is called a pioneer in ecology today. In February 1911, when &quot;The Mountain God Loves Stonefish&quot; was published in the &quot;Journal of the Anthropological Society of Tokyo&quot;, Minakata received a letter from Yanagita. This was when their correspondence between two (which was going to make a significant contribution to the study of Japanese folklore) began.

In July 1914 Kumagusu&#x27;s reputation was spread nationwide, following a newspaper report on the announcement by Walter T. Swingle, head of the Office of Crop Physiology and Breeding investigation of US Department of Agriculture, that they would invite Minakata to the US. Dr. Swingle came to Tanabe in May 1915 to announce the appointment in person. Although having intended to accept the offer, he declined it because of a family matter.

===Fundraising for the Minakata Botanical Institute===
In April 1916, Minakata obtained a property, now the Minakata residence, under the ownership of Tsunegusu. The large garden became an open-air laboratory to observe plants, frogs, and turtles. The study was a place for writing and microscopic research on plants. The godown was organized into the stacks containing a number of books and materials.

He published numerous research papers about folklore based on previous research papers of natural science already published and articles about shrine consolidation. The more scholars and celebrities he received and the busier he became with his writing, the more often he had to stay home and conduct his botanical research in the backyard. This change enabled him to discover the famous Minakatella longifila Lister — a new genus of slime mold named by Gulielma Lister, president of the British Mycological Society — from a persimmon tree in his garden in 1917.

It was around this time that the governor of Wakayama Prefecture and his friends finished the planning of the Minakata Botanical Institute. The prospectus was drafted by Tanaka Chōzaburō and promoted by 30 big names including those from the political and literary worlds, including Hara Takashi, Ōkuma Shigenobu, Yorimichi Tokugawa, and Rohan Koda.

Minakata came to Tokyo for the first time in 36 years and spent five months raising money. Day after day he visited notable figures in politics and academia including Prime Minister Takahashi Korekiyo asking for support. He finally collected a considerable sum, but it was less than the prospect amount. He continued his fundraising campaign at home.

The famous ‘Resume’ was written then responding to a request from Yoshio Yabuki, deputy branch manager of Nippon Yusen in Osaka, whom he had asked for donation. The resume, written on 7.7m long paper using fine strokes, is an autograph of extreme importance to understand the real Minakata and perhaps the longest resume in Japan and the first resume ever known in light of the volume and quality of information it contains.

In March 1925, Kumaya became ill and went into a hospital in Wakayama City. After going home to recuperate, Minakata shut the gate against all visitors. This lasted for three years until Kumaya was moved to a hospital in Kyoto in May 1928. Fair success of the fundraising in Tokyo was offset in a way by an unfulfilled promise of Tsunegusu, one of the major promoters of the project. He didn&#x27;t provide 20,000 yen, his part of donation, which caused a rift between the two brothers. Minakata also had trouble making a living because of expensive medical bills. To lessen the financial burden, Minakata published three books in 1926. The books, compilations of theses previously published in various journals, gave the reader an insight into his arguments consistent throughout the years and revealed again his erudition, which aroused the admiration of the public.

===Emperor Hirohito and Kumagusu===
Emperor Hirohito, also a biologist, had shown a strong interest in slime molds since he was the Prince Regent. As the Prince, he had read &quot;A Monograph of the Slime Molds&quot; by Gulielma Lister and told Dr. Hirotaro Hattori of the National Biological Research Institute of his wish to see the specimens. Having learned this interest, Shiro Koaze approached Minakata and his friends from Tokyo University. In November 1926 the team prepared and presented Prince Hirohito with a collection of 90 specimens of 37 genera of Japanese slime molds. It bore the signatures of Koaze as the presenter and Minakata as the selector.

In March 1929, Dr. Hattori secretly visited and requested Minakata to give a lecturer on slime molds to Hirohito, then Emperor, in his future royal visit to the Wakayama region. Minakata telegraphed his acceptance. With no precedent for a commoner giving an imperial lecture, he soon became the center of the public attention and extremely busy preparing specimens. On June 1, 1929, it had been raining since morning. Minakata headed for Kashima Island in a frock coat he had bought in America and kept for years. After taking the Emperor for a walk in the woods on the island, Minakata, while showing specimens, gave him a 25-minute lecture, on board the royal ship Nagato, on slime molds and marine life. He also presented the Emperor with gifts including 110 specimens of slime molds kept in empty taffy boxes.

A chamberlain recalled: &quot;Rumors of his eccentricity had made me doubt his capability, but my worry turned out to be utterly groundless when I met this well-mannered and polite man. He was a gentleman who had experience of living abroad as well as a traditional Japanese who showed a respect for the Imperial Family.&quot; It was the most glorious day in Minakata&#x27;s life. In the afternoon, he took pictures of him and Matsue in their finest attire at a studio and shared the moment with his relatives and close friends by giving sweets he had received from the Imperial Household. Next year, in commemoration of the Emperor&#x27;s visit to Kashima, a monument was erected on the edge of a dense wood near the point where the emperor had landed. Inscribed on the monument is a poem Minakata wrote hoping that the island would be protected forever by the benevolence and the power of the Emperor. In May 1962, more than 30 years later, the Emperor and Empress visited southern Wakayama again. Inspired by a view of Kashima from a hotel room on the Shirahama Beach the Emperor composed a &quot;waka&quot; poem, which was inscribed on the monument erected in front of the Minakata Kumagusu Museum overlooking the Kashima island.:

===Last years===
The Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, as the war escalated, the people&#x27;s life was impoverished. Minakata was not an exception. The loss of his old friends gave him an additional blow. He gradually ruined his health and stayed in bed. Although collapsing many times, he continued to work towards the completion of &quot;Nihon&quot; (the illustrated manual of Japanese fungi; drawing pictures), writing notes and giving advice to his colleagues.

In December 1941, soon after the Pacific War had erupted, Minakata was in a critical condition. On the 29 December he murmured, “I can see purple flowers blooming on the ceiling” and closed 75 years of a life filled with ups and downs. He was buried at the Kouzanji Temple in Tanabe City overlooking Kashima island.

==Achievements==
Young Minakata leaped out into the wider world when Japan was going through a metamorphosis from a feudal state into a westernized modern country. He went to America then to UK searching for a place where anybody, regardless of class, could study freely. He found it in the British Museum, where he put his heart and soul into research while buried in hundreds of books, arts and crafts and antiquities from the East and the West.

With &quot;The Constellations in the Far East&quot; as a start, he contributed a total of 50 theses to &quot;Nature&quot; and hundreds of articles and essays to the folklore magazine &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;. This large number of articles shows he won an important place in the British academia.

He was blessed with an extraordinary memory and manipulated more than 10 languages. In addition, plenty of experience of copying books enabled him to master how to scrutinize empirical documents and the methods of comparative cultural studies, which was the basis of his unbounded capacity in writing. &quot;Junishiko (A Study of Twelve Animals of Chinese Zodiac)&quot;, one of his most important works, is an example.

After coming back to Japan he wrote a number of articles in quick succession for Japanese journals and magazines. Discussions of historical evidence from the East and the West with Kunio Yanagita, as shown in their abundant correspondence, had a great influence to the birth and the development of Japanese folklore studies.

&quot;The Illustrated Book of Bionomics of Japanese Fungi&quot;, one of his greatest achievements and the embodiment of his admiration mixed with rivalry to Curtis and Berkeley, made a huge contribution to the development of the study of fungi and thus deserves international recognition. It covers 4,500 species with 15,000 pictures. Although the entries were 500 less than planned, the book also introduced his extensive research on fungi, slime molds and algae including Minakatella longifila Lister, enigmatic behavior of slime molds and parasitic algae on fish.

His advocacy of anti-shrine-consolidation protests had its roots in his deepest anger towards the loss of inhabitants’ spiritual hubs and the extinction of the landscape with which people felt an affinity. The ecological relation between nature and human beings, which Minakata looked at through the studies of biology, folklore, ethnology and religion, is something to keep in mind.

Shinzo Koizumi, late chancellor of Keio University and an admirer of Minakata, paid his tribute: &quot;We should write it in the academic history in Japan that a maverick scholar acquired such extensive knowledge and accomplished such great achievements.&quot;

The Minakata Kumagusu Museum in Shirahama introduces the life and achievements of Minakata through the exhibitions of his memorabilia, related materials, and books.

<doc id="186603" wikidata="Q1005559" url="?curid=186603" title="Yumeno Kyūsaku">
<text>was the pen name of , an early Shōwa period Japanese author, Zen priest, post office director and sub-lieutenant. The pen name roughly means &quot;a person who always dreams&quot;. His Dharma name was . He wrote detective novels and is known for his avant-gardism and his surrealistic, wildly imaginative and fantastic, even bizarre narratives. His eldest son, Sugiyama Tatsumaru, was known as the Green Father of India for spending billions of yen on reforestation.

==Early life==
Yumeno was born in Fukuoka city, Fukuoka prefecture as Sugiyama Naoki. His father, Sugiyama Shigemaru, was a major figure in the pre-war ultranationalist organization, the Genyōsha. After graduating from Shuyukan he attended the Literature Department at Keio University, but dropped out on orders from his father, and returned home to take care of the family farm. In 1926 he decided to become a Buddhist priest, but after a couple of years in the monastery, he returned home again as Sugiyama Yasumichi. By this time, he had developed a strong interest in the traditional Japanese drama form of Noh, with its genre of ghost stories and supernatural events. He found employment as a freelance reporter for the &quot;Kyushu Nippō&quot; newspaper (which later became the &quot;Nishinippon Shimbun&quot;), while writing works of fiction on the side.

==Literary career==
Kyūsaku&#x27;s first success was a nursery tale &quot;Shiraga Kozō&quot; (White Hair Boy, 1922), which was largely ignored by the public. It was not until his first novella, &quot;Ayakashi no Tsuzumi&quot; (The Spirit Drum, 1924) in the literary magazine &quot;Shin-Seinen&quot;, that his name became known.

His subsequent works include &quot;Binzume jigoku&quot; (Hell in the Bottles, 1928), &quot;Kori no hate&quot; (End of the Ice, 1933), and his most significant novel &quot;Dogura Magura&quot; (&quot;Dogra Magra&quot;, 1935), which is considered a precursor of modern Japanese science fiction and was adapted for a 1988 movie directed by Toshio Matsumoto and starring Shijaku Katsura II, Hideo Murota, and Yōji Matsuda.

&quot;Dogra Magra&quot; exemplifies modern Japanese avant-garde gothic literature. In the story, the protagonist/narrator wakes up in a hospital with amnesia. He finds out that he was the subject of an experiment by a now-dead psychiatrist, and the doctors are working to bring back his memories. It is not clear whether he was a psychotic killer or the victim of a strange psychological experiment, but it is told that he killed his mother and wife and that he inherited his psychotic tendencies from an insane ancestor. The novel is strongly influenced by Freudian psychoanalysis and, through Yumeno&#x27;s contacts there, provides considerable historical insight into the development of the study of psychoanalysis at Kyushu Imperial University.

Kyūsaku died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1936 while talking with a visitor at home.

<doc id="186609" wikidata="Q1536968" url="?curid=186609" title="Mason &amp; Dixon">
<text>Mason &amp; Dixon is a postmodernist novel by the American author Thomas Pynchon, published in 1997. It presents a fictionalized account of the collaboration between Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon in their astronomical and surveying exploits in the Dutch Cape Colony, Saint Helena, Great Britain and along the Mason-Dixon line in British North America on the eve of the Revolutionary War in the United States.

The novel, written in a style based on late-18th-century English, is a frame narrative told from the focal point of Rev. Wicks Cherrycoke, a clergyman of dubious orthodoxy who, on a cold December evening in 1786, attempts to entertain and divert his extended family (partly for amusement, and partly to keep his coveted status as a guest in the house) by telling a tall tale version of Mason and Dixon&#x27;s biographies (claiming to have accompanied Mason and Dixon throughout their journeys).

==Background==

Pynchon began work on the novel as early as 1975, and in 1978 he was reported to be in England researching the lives of Mason and Dixon. Until the release of &quot;Vineland&quot;, it was long rumored to be his next novel following &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. It was formally announced by the publisher in October 1996 with a first printing of 200,000. It was published on April30, 1997.

==Plot summary==

One: Latitudes and Departures

Episode 1

The Reverend Wicks Cherrycoke, at the Philadelphia home of his sister Elizabeth LeSpark, earns his room and board by telling stories to his niece and nephews. The novel opens during the winter of 1786 as the Reverend, by request from his nephews, embarks on his first story set in America, which begins with his recollection of the first meeting of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon as told to him by the two men.

Episode 2

A brief episode in which respective letters of introduction are exchanged between Mason and Dixon.

Episode 3

In the Royal Naval port town of Portsmouth, England in 1761, Mason and Dixon meet for the first time. After brief discussions of their respective background, the two retire to an ale house for libations before their departure on the frigate HMS &quot;Seahorse&quot; to observe the Transit of Venus from Sumatra as ordered by the Royal Society. Over the course of the evening they encounter for the first time the Learned English Dog and Fender-Belly Bodine, a soon-to-be-shipmate on board the &quot;Seahorse&quot;. Talk is made over the threat of possible French naval aggression against the relatively undersized frigate.

Episode 4

The Reverend recounts the departure of the &quot;Seahorse&quot; from Portsmouth and her passage through the English Channel. In open sea, off the coast of France, the &quot;Seahorse&quot; is pursued and attacked by the French warship &quot;l&#x27;Grand&quot;. After a pitched battle, during which Mason and Dixon remain below decks and the Reverend acts as a surgeon&#x27;s apprentice, the French unexpectedly and inexplicably break off the attack. The &quot;Seahorse&quot;, with more than thirty casualties and broken masts, limps back to Plymouth for repairs.

Episode 5

Drinking and paranoia dominate an on-shore discussion between Mason and Dixon. At a loss to explain how they survived the attack and why the French broke off the assault on the outgunned &quot;Seahorse&quot;, the pair consider reasons for the assault, including the possibility that they themselves were the target. They draft a letter to the Royal Society with their concerns and receive a swift, threatening reply reiterating their original orders.

Episode 6

Ordered once more to Bencoolen, despite its being currently occupied by French troops, Mason, Dixon, and the Reverend find themselves aboard the newly repaired &quot;Seahorse&quot;, now escorted by a second frigate as far as the open sea. During the passage to Tenerife, and eventually the southern latitudes, Mason marks the second anniversary of his wife&#x27;s death, and the passengers and crew endure shipboard boredom and isolation.

Episode 7

The &quot;Seahorse&quot; arrives for a stay in Cape Town where Mason and Dixon are greeted by a member of the local constabulary who warns them against spreading political notions amongst the colony&#x27;s slaves. Taking their meals at the Vroom household, Mason is the reluctant target of advances from the host&#x27;s beautiful daughters. Their efforts are guided by their mother, who wishes Mason to become so inflamed with desire that he will consent to sex with the slave Austra and impregnate her, producing a fair-skinned offspring for the slave market. Appalled by the notion, Mason struggles to contain himself and begins to see the colony as a hellish nightmare world. Dixon, however, takes a more libertarian view of the colony and the gap between their perceptions leads the two paranoid astronomers to question how they came to be paired together in the first place.

Episode 8

In a short episode occupied with the sensual, the two astronomers began to seek better food from outside the Vroom house. A tour of various cook-tents and cuisines ends in a marketplace meeting with the Reverend Cherrycoke. Clergy not being welcome in the areas to which she sails, the Reverend informs them over freshly picked mangoes that the &quot;Seahorse&quot; has proceeded east, leaving the men to observe the Transit of Venus from the Cape.

Episode 9

The rainy season begins with a storm lasting three days. With their father Cornelius trapped out of town by the weather, his daughters renew their flirtatious assault on Mason. They pursue him and Dixon to an observatory constructed by the &quot;Seahorse&quot; crew before their departure. Trapped inside the observatory by another storm, Mason and Dixon offer a short explanation of the reasons for observing the Transit from different areas of the globe.

Episode 10

The opening of the episode returns to Philadelphia where the Reverend, using an orrery, lectures on the Transit of Venus and the solar parallax. In Cape Town, the skies clear long enough for Mason and Dixon to take their observations. A strange lassitude descends on the colony for several weeks after the event but normal routines are soon restored, even as the Vroom daughters find new objects for their attentions. After several months, Mason and Dixon depart Cape Town aboard HMS &quot;Mercury&quot;. The Reverend closes the episode by musing whether something other than philosophical or scientific desire drives astronomers worldwide to their observations.

Episode 11

While the Reverend sails on to British India, the &quot;Mercury&quot; makes port at the island of St. Helena, depicted as a surreal and desolate location. During an evening stroll that takes them within viewing distance of the island&#x27;s gallows, Mason and Dixon encounter the Lady Florinda, with whom Mason had a brief tryst after the death of his wife. A flashback depicts their meeting a year before at the hanging of Lord Ferrers in London before the episode closes with the introduction of Florinda&#x27;s fiancé.

Episode 12

The two astronomers spend time with Nevil Maskelyne, who is on the island to make observations but suffers from faulty equipment. Despite political and personal differences, they belatedly celebrate Maskelyne&#x27;s 29th birthday. Dixon is ordered to return alone to Cape Town, while Mason comes to terms with his orders to remain on St. Helena. Two clocks, one having been with Maskelyne during the transit, the other with Mason and Dixon, discuss the differences between the two locations and the particular behaviors of the titular heroes. The episode closes with Dixon departing for the Cape with the clock previously kept by Maskelyne, leaving behind Mason and the other clock.

Episode 13

Lunar connections and allusions pervade the episode. With Dixon away to the Cape, Mason turns his attention to his new assignment—assisting Maskelyne in his attempts to establish observations of the lunar distance as the preferred means of obtaining longitude at sea. He is unnerved by Maskelyne&#x27;s account of his former assistant and the erratic and paranoid behavior of the lunatic astronomer. Maskelyne is wary of political enemies at home and conspiracies on the island concerning his appointment and the benefits of being related to Clive of India, a prominent figure in the East India trade. Mason&#x27;s own paranoia and melancholy wax as he remains on the island, but he manages to maintain enough perspective to falsify a flattering interpretation of the Maskelyne&#x27;s horoscope during one night of drinking at Maskelyne&#x27;s favorite bar, The Moon.

Episode 14

The episode plays upon relativity, simultaneity, and conjunction. Upon a high ridge of St. Helena, Mason wanders as he wonders whether Dixon has landed safely on the Cape and what he might be about at that minute. Dixon, it turns out, is spending a large amount of time avoiding the consequences of the Vroom daughters&#x27; fascination with Mason, who, rumors in town have it, became involved with all of the daughters, the mother, and a slave during his stay on the Cape. Dixon is able to stop Cornelius Vroom from shooting him as a substitute for Mason, and the two spend an evening at The World&#x27;s End, Vroom&#x27;s local watering hole. There, Dixon makes first-hand observations on the debauchery that pervades the Dutch of the Cape and glimpses the consequences for the colony&#x27;s black populace. He carries a drunken Cornelius home and is warned by the daughter Gret to hide the clock he has brought with him because of the contemporary fascination and paranoia regarding the rigors of time and the workings of mechanical clocks.

Episode 15

The first of three episodes that veers between Mason&#x27;s time on the island working with the frustrated, and possibly mad Maskelyne, and his recounting of events to Dixon upon their joint return to England. Mason and Maskelyne, whose obsession with his faulty instruments only grows, visit the haunting Windward side of the island for observations. Maskelyne tells Mason how a soldier he saved from throwing himself off a nearby cliff now harbors hope that Maskelyne&#x27;s connections to Clive will get him out of further service on the god forsaken island. Amidst unceasing wind, Mason suspects the soldier is in fact a ghost, and the ghost of Mason&#x27;s late wife Rebekah visits him for the first time.

Episode 16

Mason tells Dixon how he first met his wife Rebekah at a cheese-rolling festival in Randwick, but his narrative is briefly interrupted by the Reverend&#x27;s audience who protest contradictions with historical records. Back on the island, Rebekah&#x27;s visitations continue and Mason soon learns for certain that Dieter, the soldier, too is a ghost and Maskelyne&#x27;s private specter. He flees to the coast and purchases transport back to town aboard a dhow.

Episode 17

Arriving back in Jamestown, Mason is diverted by Florinda&#x27;s now ex-fiancé, Mournival, who conducts Mason on a tour of his new enterprise, a museum dedicated to Jenkins&#x27; Ear. Presented with the ear itself, said to have magical properties of fulfilling wishes whispered into it, Mason begins to ask for the return of his wife but instead wishes a safe voyage to St. Helena for Dixon. For his part, Dixon later jokes that while still in Cape Town he fancied hearing Mason&#x27;s wish in the voice of the wind shortly before his departure. The two ponder the possibilities and reflect on Maskelyne&#x27;s possible madness as they make the return trip to England.

Episode 18

Upon their return to England in June, the two astronomers part ways, with Dixon going north to his family and Mason procrastinating against a visit to his. Shortly after making his way home, however, Mason&#x27;s mentor and benefactor James Bradley falls ill and dies, occasioning Mason to reflect on his beginnings in astronomy and the real circumstances of his courtship with Rebekah.

Episode 19

The death of Bradley is the topic of discussion at a local pub called &quot;The George&quot; and provides a segue into talk about the 1752 conversion of England to the Gregorian calendar and the resulting &quot;missing&quot; eleven days. Much is made over how days might be done away with and the temporal effect on those who were alive at the time. The discussion grows heated and scientific by turns and introduces a new territory to the book with the revelation that Macclesfield recruited a cadre of &quot;Asiatic Pygmies&quot; to colonize the missing time and preserve temporal flow. The pygmies, Mason states, now live perpetually in the past, eleven days behind the rest of British society and may occasionally be glimpsed moving as ghosts in the present.

Episode 20

Mason visits his father&#x27;s house and we are introduced for the first time to his two sons. Mason also meets Delicia Quall, a neighbor-woman who believes Mason should give up astronomy, stay in England with his sons, stop grieving for Rebekah, and marry her. Mason&#x27;s father, a baker, is also present and we learn of his initial opposition to Mason&#x27;s career in star-gazing. The younger Mason reveals that his next destination is likely to be America.

Episode 21

Mason recalls to himself his early days with Rebekah, his proposal to her, and his elation that she does not disapprove of his profession. He answers his sons&#x27; questions about America and his purpose there. Then, in the summer of 1763, he returns to London to begin preparations for his journey and has another brief encounter with Maskelyne, now returned from St. Helena and soon bound for the West Indies.

Episode 22

The episode opens in the Hurworth home of William Emerson, Dixon&#x27;s longtime mentor and former instructor. After a brief interruption from the Reverend Cherrycoke&#x27;s audience discussing the magic and commercial prospects in America, Dixon is introduced to Father Christopher Maire, a Jesuit priest and acquaintance of Emerson. Dixon&#x27;s early apprenticeship to Emerson is recounted, including Emerson&#x27;s disappointment that Dixon would choose an earth-bound profession such as surveying, before Maire and Emerson appeal to him to accept the commission in America and to agree to regular contact with the Jesuits regarding the progress of the mission. Dixon is reluctant to become associated with the Jesuits, fearing retaliation, but agrees to consider the idea as the episode closes and all three make their way to Emerson&#x27;s local pub, The Cudgel and Throck.

Episode 23

At Emerson&#x27;s local pub, with Maire disguising his Jesuit connections under civilian clothes, the trio discusses a variety of topics including China, Feng Shui, ley lines, and a network of ancient tunnels that lies beneath County Durham. Dixon and Emerson recount various expeditions into the tunnels and offer explanations to their use and meaning. Maire&#x27;s admission that he has spent time in Italy heightens suspicion of his identity but he quickly deflects it by offering to cook the first pizza in England, a ghastly concoction of tough bread, ketchup brought back from the Cape by Dixon, and stilton cheese.

Episode 24

In a reflection of Mason&#x27;s recollections in Episode 21, Dixon describes the early days of the courtship and relationship between his father, George, and his mother, Mary. Dixon also dwells on the death of his father several years before and the impact it had on his personal and professional trajectory. While journeying down the Thames River, where he will meet Mason to sign the contract that will send them to America, Dixon and the boat&#x27;s crew encounter a heavy fog that mystically, but briefly, transports them to the hostile shores of Delaware.

Episode 25

After a year and a half apart, Mason and Dixon meet again in London in 1763. Over ale, Dixon conveys his sympathy for the loss of Bradley and Mason reveals that Bradley had been en route to Plymouth to see them off on their ill-fated first journey aboard the &quot;Seahorse&quot;. The two consider the prospect of danger in America and wonder whether the work they performed since sending the Royal Society their letter of concern after the attack by the &quot;l&#x27;Grand&quot; in some way smoothed over any doubts about their fitness. The two men indulge in paranoid discussion regarding the reasons Bradley may have wanted to see them, hidden purposes for their new undertaking, as well as the various interests that attach importance to their previous and current endeavors.

Two: America

Episode 26
The intrepid duo arrive in America and are promptly greeted by the sights, smells, and sounds thereof. The Rev&#x27;d Cherrycoke&#x27;s audience interrupts to discuss the variety of evangelical religions that have sprung up under the ministrations of one MacClenaghan and its reflections on the musical influences of the day. The episode concludes with a demonstration of new musical themes upon a clavier and its effect upon revolutionary impulses.

Episode 27

Visiting an apothecary in Philadelphia, the two men meet Benjamin Franklin, who invites them to a coffee-house, a veritable hot-bed of insurrection and revolutionary talk. There, Dr. Franklin introduces them to Molly and Dolly (women of questionable reputation) and proceeds to quiz Mason on Dixon&#x27;s association with the Jesuits and Dixon on Mason&#x27;s association with Bradley and the East India Company. The episode concludes with Franklin ushering the two men into a carriage that will convey them to Virginia and a meeting with one Colonel Washington.

Episode 28

At Mt. Vernon, the two men enjoy a late afternoon drink, snacks, and some marijuana with George Washington. The discussion ranges between Judaism, Chief Pontiac, the demarcation of western lines by the French and British, and the telluric plates left by one Celeron de Bienville in his efforts to claim territory. Upon their return to Philadelphia, they engage Dr. Franklin anew and he speculates on their shared goals and the Sino-Jesuit connection that Franklin and others believe is intent on creating a communications network across the continent.

Episode 29

A brief episode that finds Mason indulging in paranoid worry over the Commissioners of the Boundary Line, their roots in secret organizations, and the size of bugs in America. The episode concludes in an ale-house where Dr. Franklin, in the guise of Poor Richard entertains the crowd with an electric dazzle before rushing outside to capture the power of a fresh thunderstorm.

Episode 30

In late December 1763, the astronomers complete the first of their tasks as assigned by the Commissioners: establish the southernmost limit of the city of Philadelphia. Erecting an observatory near Cedar Street they mark the line of the city, and the latitude they will follow west, as 15 miles south of the city. Dixon, in yet another coffee house, falls into conversation with Dolly over Mason&#x27;s and Molly&#x27;s shared melancholic personalities, and a series of puzzling measurements that seem to suggest Pennsylvania is moving by degrees each year.

Episode 31

The duo awake one morning and find the city abuzz with news of the Paxton Boys&#x27; massacre of Native Americans at Lancaster, not far from Philadelphia. Reminded of the violence on the Cape, and spooked by the militant attitude of the local citizenry, the two men wonder aloud how they might avoid both Paxtons and Indians during their journey west. The Reverend Cherrycoke and his audience debate the original meaning of &#x27;liberty&#x27; and the barbaric treatment of Indians by Anglo-American colonists before the episode returns to find a highly caffeinated Mason and Dixon discussing the origins of violence in American society. Dixon likens the current situation of hide-and-seek from various forces to his own childhood reminiscences of the Jacobite networks in Durham.

Episode 32

A brief opening featuring the Reverend&#x27;s audience is followed by a lengthy episode centering once more on time and time-keeping devices. Dixon reveals that before their departure from England he was given a chronometer watch by Emerson, the major feature of which is the perpetual motion of its inner workings and the consequent lack of need to wind it. The peculiarities of the watch lead to discussions on Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; and the laws of motion. Charged with preserving the timepiece by Emerson, Dixon is dismayed when it is swallowed whole by the obsessed R.C., a surveyor linked to a tangent on Mason and Dixon&#x27;s line. Emerson, informed of the news via a letter which Mason suggests may release Dixon from his obligations, celebrates wildly.

Episode 33

The episode covers a full year of work by the astronomers, opening in January 1764 with the reverberations of the massacre and the attack on Fort Pitt still being felt. Mason and Dixon make their base of operations south of the city near the house of John Harland. There, they erect a new base of observation and proceed to mark off the Tangent Line. The work occasions a discussion of the history of the boundary dispute and various mathematical and political attempts to set the line.

Episode 34

Mason and Dixon make separate journeys to the site of the Lancaster massacre and endure the specter of racial violence and the suspicion of the locals.

Episode 35

The Reverend&#x27;s audience once more raises objections to his story based on historical facts, while the Rev&#x27;d himself maintains that history is preserved not in universal acceptance of one story but in the propagation of different interpretations by novelists, playwrights, and poets. Thus armed, the good Rev&#x27;d sets the scene for his reunion with the astronomers in a Philadelphia watering hole known as The India Queen. There, the Reverend encounters locals much concerned with religion since the revelation experienced by one of their members who now wanders the west in an attempt to convert others to his vision.

Episode 36

During a nor&#x27;easter, Mason and Dixon seek refuge in an inn called &quot;The India Queen&quot; and discover the presence of Reverend Cherrycoke, who now bears a commission as chaplain of the expedition. Decidedly nonplussed by this revelation, the duo welcome his company and proceed to spend the night at the inn drinking, talking, and observing the variety of clientele brought in by the storm while they enjoy the food of its exiled French chef, Armand Allegre. The next morning, before the assembled guests, Allegre embarks on a recollection of his story, dubbed the Iliad of Inconvenience.

Episode 37

Allegre recounts his long apprenticeship to one of the great chefs in Paris, culminating in his own fame throughout France for his various preparations of duck. His fame brings him to the attention of the Mechanical Duck, the invention of one Jacques de Vaucanson. By reasons not entirely understood, the Duck attains consciousness and an exponential leap in its physical abilities far beyond human ingenuity. Thus imbued, it now holds Allegre responsible for the death of all fellow ducks prepared for the dining room table and demands as payment that he assist the Duck by rescuing another of Vauscanon&#x27;s automaton, a counterpart duck. Ever-persecuted by the Duck, Allegre flees to America.

Episode 38

Back in the India Queen, Allegre&#x27;s story is challenged by a Mr. Dimdown, but the potential duel is interrupted by the Duck when Dimdown&#x27;s sword is flung from his hand by an invisible force. A discussion on the Duck&#x27;s continued ascent beyond the simple physics of its design and Allegre&#x27;s wonder at the foods in America eventually turns to serious discussion of Christian rituals of communion versus heathen beliefs about cannibalism. Dimdown and Allegre reconcile over comparisons between the layers of pastry and the layered Damascus steel of Dimdown&#x27;s blade.

Episode 39

Still trapped by the snow, Mason and Dixon open the episode in a quarrel over Mason&#x27;s melancholy and its best remedy. While Dixon grows fat eating the baked goods of his amorous object, Mason steadfastly refuses to enjoy sensual delights. When a break in the weather permits their departure, the two ride in separate directions: Mason to the north, and Dixon to the south. Dixon journeys to Virginia where Thomas Jefferson offers a brief history on Virginia&#x27;s own border.

Episode 40

Six years after Rebekah&#x27;s passing, Mason journeys north into Manhattan and eventually Long Island where he is nearly attacked by a gang of thieves. He pretends briefly to be French rather than British and ends up avoiding unpleasantness by helping to fix the band&#x27;s telescope. During the course of his work he and the gang discuss actual slavery versus the virtual slavery of contemporary wage-labor, the lack of colonial representation in the House of Commons, and how the British image of America contrasts with the reality. Leaving the group and headed towards Philadelphia again, Mason begins to sense for the first time how public sentiment in the colonies is shaping the future of the world.

Episode 41

The Reverend&#x27;s brother-in-law, LeSpark, reveals that he briefly encountered the astronomers in the private ridotto of the iron-monger, slave-holder, and inveterate gambler Lord Lepton. Lepton, who fled England to escape his gambling debts, entertains the surveyors at his private castle in the Pennsylvania country side. With concubines purchased from the Canadian convent the Widows of Christ, Lepton&#x27;s debauched party takes on a hellish air that unnerves the surveyors and makes them anxious to flee.

Episode 42

Dixon proposes to steal one of Lepton&#x27;s iron bath tubs as compensation for the twenty pounds he believes were unfairly taken from him during a night of gambling. Using magnetic principles taught to him by Emerson, he and Mason attempt to steal the tub but are distracted first by one of Lepton&#x27;s servants who reminds them of a previous acquaintance and then by the appearance of a pentacle that unpleasantly connects Lepton to the massacre at Lancaster. They make a hasty departure, having taken on new party members, including an electric eel they presently begin to use as a compass.

Episode 43

After several months of surveying, Mason and Dixon return to Newark. They retrieve their correspondence from the previous months and Mason learns that Maskelyne has been appointed Astronomer Royal, replacing Mason&#x27;s departed mentor, James Bradley. In typical fashion, Dixon consoles Mason who, despite his common background, had hoped his association with Bradley and the work done on the Transit might make him a candidate for the post.

Episode 44

The episode&#x27;s epigraph quotes the Reverend on the properties of ley lines and recalls Dixon&#x27;s own scholarship on the topic under Emerson&#x27;s guidance as the crew speculates on the effects of placing crystal markers exactly upon these mystical points. Several ax-men, many of Swedish origin, are added to the crew and in April the surveyors begin to move west, dividing north and south and even a house as they go.

Episode 45

The Mechanical Duck continues to follow Allegre and the rest of the crew as they survey west. Allegre proposes that the Duck&#x27;s obsession with him is tied to its paradoxical evolution, in which it both ascends beyond the realm of limited physical ability and is simultaneously bound to more earthly motivations. Mason inevitably and perhaps subconsciously links the Duck&#x27;s passage from one world to the next, and Vaucanson&#x27;s efforts to understand the resulting change, to his own feelings on Rebekah&#x27;s passing.

Episode 46

A morning revue of the crew occasions an opportunity for Mason and Dixon to hear various grievances and offer solutions. One common complaint is the extortion practiced by the prostitutes following the camp. The episode is extended by negotiations between the camp pimp, Nathanael McLean, and the head girl, Mrs. Eggslap.

Episode 47

A heavy thunderstorm is the backdrop for the first half of the episode, which features the standard bickering between Mason and Dixon and some notes on the drawing of Arcs and Tangents on the line. Ordered to extend the Tangent and Meridian, the crew passes into dairy country and young Nathanael in particular is smitten by one of the plethora of fair milk-maids.

Episode 48

The surveyors continue to draw their line, moving back eastward at the opening of the section but always near the Susquehanna River which serves as a boundary of more than one type. In their efforts to close off the Tangent line they discover some anomalies in previous measurements as well as legal inconsistencies that leave a small &quot;Wedge&quot; of ambiguous territory neither in Maryland or Pennsylvania, creating yet another of the novel&#x27;s uncharted alternate domains. Two &quot;Chain-men&quot;, Darby and Cope, attract some attention for impersonating Mason and Dixon in order to seduce the locals. The chapter closes with the discovery of their subterfuge, Squire Haligast warning that the party will soon encounter &quot;China-men,&quot; and the delivery of a package from Maskelyne telling of geographical interferences with measurements that forces Mason to recall the windward side of St. Helena.

Episode 49

As they cross the Susquehanna and the colonist population begins to thin, the camp&#x27;s retinue grows increasingly large and lengthens behind them. The near-Eden of unspoiled country, mystical and mesmerizing, prompts reflection and some paranoia over the future on the part of the duo. Acknowledging their obligations and the compulsory nature of their work, the two wonder whether they are not being used, each favoring their usual conspiracy: religion and the Jesuits for Mason, commerce and the East India Co. for Dixon. They draw near the Redzinger farm and discover that Peter, the wandering apostle, has returned, claiming Christ has abandoned him. The Reverend and his audience close the episode with speculation on the mathematical shape of heaven and hell.

Episode 50

As fall approaches, Mason and Dixon adopt a habit of exploring local roads for taverns and inns at the end of each day&#x27;s surveying. The episode&#x27;s main action takes place in one such locale, The Rabbi of Prague, whose denizens consist of Kabbalistic individuals and whose habits and bearings resemble, among others, those of Popeye and Mr. Spock. Passing the evening in their company, Dixon learns of a local golem created by Native Americans and of theories that the American continent was &quot;discovered&quot; as a result of God&#x27;s retreat at the dawn of the Enlightenment.

Episode 51

An opening that features the two main characters playing practical jokes on one another is followed by a night of heavy rain and fearful talk of Indian attack and The Black Dog, the latest fearsome-fantastic rumored to stalk the wilderness and a possible stand-in for Cerberus. On September 21, the first day of autumn, Mason and Dixon pass over South Mountain on their way toward Antietam Creek. There, they tour a cave system with spectacular formations and some ancient and undecipherable writings that produce profoundly different reactions in the polar temperaments of the surveyors.

Episode 52

With the summer of surveying drawing to a close, the camp passes over the west branch of Conococheague Creek, a territory claimed by the Black Boys and echoing with their deeds. Turning back East for the winter, the crew pass near the site of General Braddock&#x27;s defeat some years earlier. The scenery and passing of the seasons moves their thoughts to the past, causing Mason and Dixon to wonder on the relation between this defeat and the treatment of British weavers rebelling against wage reduction by James Wolfe, hero of the Abraham Plains. The episode closes during winter and New Year with sledding, drinking, and discussions of altitude and unbounded space.

Episode 53

An apparent captivity narrative begins, telling of how an unidentified colonial American woman is taken from her farmstead by nonviolent Indians across the Susquehanna River and north to a Jesuit college in Quebec. There, she begins training to become a Widow of Christ, encounters the intricacies of Jesuit telegraphy, and meets a Chinese Feng-shui master.

Episode 54

The captivity narrative continues, and is revealed as a detour of the story by the potentially amorous young cousins, Tenebrae and Ethelmer, who thus far have listened to Cherrycoke&#x27;s tale, but are now in Ethelmer&#x27;s room reading passages from &quot;The Ghastly Fop&quot;, a pulp series. Tenebrae falls asleep after the American Woman and the Chinese Feng-shui master escape the Widows of Christ, and this narrative merges with Cherrycoke&#x27;s story of Mason and Dixon, where Mason sees an uncanny resemblance between the woman and his departed wife, Rebekah. A discussion of metempsychosis ensues. Mason then has strange dreams of Rebekah, and decides the American Woman is not so like her after all.

Episode 55

Captain Zhang the Chinese Feng-shui master, convinced the party is being tracked by Jesuits, ignites discussion within the company of various conspiracy theories concerning the line. Included are the possibilities that they are being used by Jesuits to rid the earth of Feng-shui (the line being a terrible example of it, according to Zhang), or guided, perhaps magnetically, to secret ore deposits cherished by the Indians and required for the manufacture of ammunition. Captain Zhang&#x27;s paranoia turns maniacal; he becomes convinced he himself is in fact the Jesuit spy until debunked by the other members of the party. Meanwhile, the amorous cousins part unrequited, she having fallen asleep, and the main narrative returns to Cherrycoke&#x27;s telling.

Episode 56

Mason tells Dixon how he visited the missing eleven days that were canceled when England adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752. He found himself &quot;alone in the material World&quot;, without any people, and visited Oxford, finding the city completely empty. He perused the Bodleian Library, and felt that other entities, possibly intelligent, were searching the volumes there. At the end of the eleven days, Mason reunites with Rebekah, and in the present he confides in Dixon that he feels that after his death he will likewise meet her again.

Episode 57

Early 1766. Mason and Dixon again depart in opposite directions for a winter break, this time Dixon heading north to New York, where he runs into the same gang Mason previously encountered there, though they are now somewhat transformed by revolutionary sentiment. Dimdown, similarly transformed, re-enters and Dixon marvels at the breadth of the movement and the possibility of insurrection, discussing grievances against the crown before engaging in a friendly debate over the quality of American versus British beer.

Episode 58

Mason travels south to Virginia, where he revisits with George Washington in a billiard hall and, much like Dixon in New York, discovers conversation monopolized by pre-revolutionary indignation. Mason is then questioned by Nathanael McLean, a former member of his party turned slothful student, about the repercussions, karmic or otherwise, of the line.

Episode 59

The surveyors return to camp in spring from their respective winter destinations to find it in disarray. An episode involving Captain Shelby, a member of their party, performing a shotgun wedding, including details of the preceding fighting and ensuing partying, is related to them.

Episode 60

Shelby, also a surveyor and possibly unstable, accompanies the party westward and questions Dixon about the line. Dixon and Zhang then converse and arrive at the subject of dragons, whence Dixon relates the long tale of the Lambton Worm, conquered by a returning crusader who, following the battle, broke the oath he swore with God in order to achieve victory—an act that left his family cursed for nine generations. The party discuss and interpret the tale, and Shelby suggests, perhaps menacingly, that the surveyors accompany him to a &quot;serpent mound&quot; whose design can only be appreciated from far above, alluding to Dixon&#x27;s past with Emerson and the ley-lines.

Episode 61

Shelby takes Mason and Dixon to investigate the &quot;serpent mound&quot;, which turns out to be a perfect cone, designed and constructed much in the manner of a Leyden jar. Shelby insists it is of both Welsh and Native American origin, and that cryptic markings scratched into its side are warnings to the surveyors, who discover their compasses malfunction while in its vicinity. Back in camp with Zhang, they discuss Jesuit machinations and their possible connection to extraterrestrials, in conjunction with a debate over hollow-earth theories. The chapter ends with a humorous episode in which either Death or The Devil, following the party as a &quot;third surveyor&quot;, tries to hire a lawyer.

Episode 62

Stig, an axman in the party, is exposed as spy working on behalf of a group Dixon dubs &quot;Swedish Jacobites&quot;, who Stig claims descended from the far north and were the first to arrive at Philadelphia, where they lived in peace with the natives, irking the Americans with their claim to the land and thus somehow leading to the boundary dispute and the line. All this is thrown into relief by Stig&#x27;s own admission he may not even be Swedish, that he may be a mercenary, and that he believes an armed attack against Philadelphia an imminent possibility. Meanwhile, the party continues west; Dixon, in discussion with Mason and Zhang, notes the only true difference between the individual colonies, and the expedition is confronted by bushmen.

Episode 63

A brief episode involving Zepho Beck, owner of a farmhouse near the line, who, upon the emergence of the full moon, becomes a were-beaver—leading him to enter into a moonlit tree-felling contest with Stig the axman. Zepho takes a massive lead, only to lose his beaver form mid-contest as a result of a lunar eclipse the astronomers had forgotten was taking place. Gamblers betting on Zepho suggest a lawsuit should be brought against them, could it be proven they knew it would happen. Zhang tells them he knows of just such an incident, and begins to relate the story.

Episode 64

Zhang tells the story of Hsi and Ho, ancient Chinese astronomers, who are forced to flee when they fail to predict an eclipse, embarrassing their master the emperor who should have intimate knowledge of all &quot;divine&quot; occurrences. They escape via flying apparatus, bickering all the while, and crash into the estate of a wealthy lord with a &quot;harem&quot; of nubile daughters, who hires them so he can have foreknowledge of celestial events and gain an advantage in business and war. In one version of the story their neglect of their profession leads him to banish them to the desert; in another it leads to his death and their appropriation of his lands, wealth, and daughters.

Episode 65

The surveyors run the line, while Zhang questions the effect of the lost 11 days on the Chinese calendar, and whether it has created inconsistencies and error among all historical time-keeping, leading to discourse on the correct dating of the birth of Christ.

Episode 66

The story carries into 1767, the surveyor&#x27;s &quot;last year upon the line&quot;. First Stig is bizarrely interrogated, and they hear ghosts in the wind, before stumbling upon a barn-raising party where characters including Armand and The Duck resurface. Later they arrive in Cumberland, where they meet Thomas Cresap and his family, hear stories of Cresap&#x27;s exploits, and discover the town to be essentially lawless and somewhat reminiscent of the wild west, complete with lone sheriff. Mason attempts to converse with a dog, who understands his questions but chooses to ignore him.

Episode 67

The party is joined by a delegation of Indians, who partake in further discussion between the surveyors and Zhang regarding Jesuit methods of forming boundaries. The party is informed by the Indians they will soon reach a mystical &quot;Warrior-Path&quot; they will not be allowed to cross, heralding the end of their journey. The Indians then regale them with tales of an area to the west filled with giant produce and containing a marijuana plant so large its branches support settlements, perhaps as a coded effort to sell the surveyors some of that latter substance. Eventually they are taken there, and discover huge tomatoes and beets, which they reason cannot be God&#x27;s work and must be the legacy of departed giants.

Episode 68

The surveyors release most of the party, keeping their retinue of Indians and a few others, and continue west with the line, taking a ferry across the Youghiogheny river-lake. The stygian captain of the ferry discusses with them the ghost-fish in the river, his personal tragedies, America&#x27;s propensity for war, and, to the dismay of the surveyors, points out and makes personal use of the correlation between war and business. The party then ponders what awaits them on the other side.

Episode 69

The Duck, its powers augmented by the negative energy of the line and obsessed with a decoy the party have created and placed upon it, becomes a permanent resident of it. Dixon meanwhile becomes obsessed with infinite westward expansion, and the party approaches the Monongahela River. Meanwhile, two &quot;axmen&quot; are killed by a falling tree. A wide variety of Indian nations take an interest in the party as it passes through their lands, where the surveyors eventually travel upon the &quot;Warrior-Path&quot; amid feuding war-parties. Lastly, Mason and Dixon share a dream of pursuing their path further west.

Episode 70

The surveyors finish the line, and deciding to take their chances, leave the party and cross the &quot;Warrior-Path&quot; in the dead of night to ride to the river, all the while suffering from various ailments and delusions, as well as paranoia they will encounter a similar fate to Edward Braddock. They reach the river and are discovered there by Indians familiar to them, who are returning from scalping Lord Lepton, proving it by displaying his rifle, complete with its menacing and possibly satanic insignia. The party then commences the return journey, heading east amid hardship and difficult weather.

Episode 71

Back in Delaware, the surveyors argue over the significance of the line and its planography while tavern-crawling. They then stay the following year in America, busy with the degree of latitude, chaining a Meridian Line through boggy terrain. Meanwhile, it is intimated that Dixon might prefer to remain in America, and they reflect on their voyages, the commonality of slavery in all their destinations, and the voyage home and what may await them there.

Episode 72

The surveyors complete the meridian line and venture to Baltimore, where Dixon interferes with a slave-driver, first berating him in a tavern before beating him in the street, liberating his slaves, and escaping with Mason, who admires him for his action. They ride north, converse with Zhang, and reach New York, from where they will depart the colonies. Mason is visited again by Rebekah, who presses him upon his duty to her. In New York they are unable to find previous acquaintances, are accosted by a cryptic stranger upon the docks, and set sail.

Episode 73

In an episode conceived in the form of an Italian opera, an alternate, imaginary version of the surveyors&#x27; final days in America is relayed where they continue west past the Ohio River, cross the Mississippi, encounter a variety of carnivalesque inhabitants of the interior, and become the first to discover Uranus. Again Dixon wishes to remain, but Mason sees the &quot;new&quot; planet as a ticket to acceptance and a life of ease, so they return east, making all those they met and passed while going west uneasy. In the end Dixon imagines continuing east with the line, and drawing it straight across the Atlantic.

Three: Last Transit

Episode 74

Mason and Dixon return to London, where they decline, for various possible reasons, to accept another assignment together. Dixon is sent to the North Cape, Norway to observe the return Transit of Venus, while Mason is sent to Ireland to do the same. There, he is conscripted into helping deal with a peat-flow, given to temperamental behavior, and visited again by Rebekah. Upon his return to London he argues with Maskelyne, who assures him their office is no longer what it once was, and accepts another assignment to travel to Scotland.

Episode 75

Mason visits Dixon, who is now home from his assignment, on his way North to Scotland. The two friends fish and drink, admitting finally the strength of their relationship without quite putting it into words. Dixon relates to Mason his trip to the North Cape, and claims to have visited the civilization inside the earth, entering through the north pole, one of many openings to a massive hollow chamber with upside-down seas. The episode then concludes with Mason promising to visit again—Dixon being unable to travel, having come down with a case of gout.

Episode 76

Mason meets Samuel Johnson at an inn on the border of Scotland (a meeting dismissed as fictitious by Cherrycoke&#x27;s audience), and the two discuss Scotland and America, as well as men like Cherrycoke, and Johnson&#x27;s biographer, James Boswell, who are always &quot;scribbling things down&quot;. The brief episode ends with a vision of Mason&#x27;s later life.

Episode 77

Mason visits Dixon who is recently married and suffering from gout. Dixon laments that the recent death of his mother and the political turbulence in America have forced him to abandon his hopes of emigration, deciding instead to profit from the Britain&#x27;s growing coal dependency. Mason, himself remarried, confesses that his newborn son unpleasantly resembles his father who has himself remarried a Mary. The Learned English Dog makes another appearance, though he refrains from speech except to declare that he will next visit when the two surveyors are together once again. The two men share a dream of a performance where, in Mason&#x27;s version, he attempts to introduce Dixon to Bradley, whilst Dixon envisions a duet based on their adventures.

Episode 78

Upon hearing of Dixon&#x27;s death, Mason and his son Doctor Isaac make a pilgrimage to his grave reminiscent of the journeys the two surveyors previously embarked upon together. The Learned English Dog fails to make a bodily appearance. However, a cat lurks around Dixon&#x27;s grave with a keen interest in the two Masons. Slipping into senility, Mason finally lets Maskelyne have it, as the two engage in a heated squabble over astrology and the events after Bradley&#x27;s passing. Mason, now settled in America, is visited by the elderly Benjamin Franklin who is accosted by rantings of Mason&#x27;s in regards to hidden messages in Bradley&#x27;s contentious observations. Mason&#x27;s second wife Mary prays for her husband and returns to England with their younger children, while Doctor Isaac and William, Rebekah&#x27;s sons, stay in America and see out their father&#x27;s final days. The story ends as the two brothers reminisce on how they as boys always wished for the day their father would take them to America.

==Reception==
&quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; was one of the most acclaimed novels of the 1990s. According to Harold Bloom, &quot;Pynchon always has been wildly inventive, and gorgeously funny when he surpasses himself: the marvels of this book are extravagant and unexpected.&quot; Bloom has also called the novel &quot;Pynchon’s late masterpiece.&quot; John Fowles wrote: &quot;As a fellow-novelist I could only envy it and the culture that permits the creation and success of such intricate masterpieces.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, T. Coraghessan Boyle wrote, &quot;This is the old Pynchon, the true Pynchon, the best Pynchon of all. &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; is a groundbreaking book, a book of heart and fire and genius, and there is nothing quite like it in our literature ...&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Michiko Kakutani said, &quot;It is a book that testifies to [Pynchon&#x27;s] remarkable powers of invention and his sheer power as a storyteller, a storyteller who this time demonstrates that he can write a novel that is as moving as it is cerebral, as poignant as it is daring.&quot;

During a conversation with Leonard Pierce of the &quot;A.V. Club&quot;, Harold Bloom said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I would choose if I had to select a single work of sublime fiction from the last century ... it would probably be &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;, if it were a full-scale book, or if it were a short novel it would probably be &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;. Pynchon has the same relation to fiction, I think, that my friend John Ashbery has to poetry: he is beyond compare.&quot;

John Krewson, also writing for &quot;A.V. Club&quot;, observed, &quot;Whatever meanings and complex messages may lie hidden in Pynchon&#x27;s text can, for now, be left to develop subconsciously as the reader enjoys the more immediate rewards of the work of a consummate storyteller. Pynchon is one, and he never quite lets you forget that while this might be an epic story, it&#x27;s an epic story told to wide-eyed children who are up past their bedtime.&quot;

In contrast, Walter Kirn of &quot;Slate&quot; described the book as “tiresome mind games”, criticizing Pynchon’s brand of humor (including anachronisms and flatulence) as unfunny and stating, “The low part of the higher mind that Pynchon so pyrotechnically appeals to (the same part that responds to Escher drawings, PDQ Bach, and perspective-switching holograms) is not a part of myself I’m in touch with, nor do I particularly long to be. I admire Pynchon; I’m wowed by him at times; but the truth is I’m happy leaving him to the experts whose academic labs gave birth to him.“

==Legacy==

Pynchon&#x27;s work is part of the metahistorical romance genre evaluated by Amy J. Elias in &quot;Sublime Desire: History and Post-1960s Fiction&quot;.

Mark Knopfler wrote a song about the book called &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia,” originally performed as a duet with James Taylor.

<text>The nickel–cadmium battery (Ni–Cd battery or NiCad battery) is a type of rechargeable battery using nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium as electrodes. The abbreviation &quot;Ni–Cd&quot; is derived from the chemical symbols of nickel (Ni) and cadmium (Cd): the abbreviation &quot;NiCad&quot; is a registered trademark of SAFT Corporation, although this brand name is commonly used to describe all Ni–Cd batteries.

Wet-cell nickel–cadmium batteries were invented in 1899. A Ni–Cd battery has a terminal voltage during discharge of around 1.2 volts which decreases little until nearly the end of discharge. The maximum electromotive force offered by a Ni–Cd cell is 1.3V. Ni–Cd batteries are made in a wide range of sizes and capacities, from portable sealed types interchangeable with carbon–zinc dry cells, to large ventilated cells used for standby power and motive power. Compared with other types of rechargeable cells they offer good cycle life and performance at low temperatures with a fair capacity but their significant advantage is the ability to deliver practically their full rated capacity at high discharge rates (discharging in one hour or less). However, the materials are more costly than that of the lead–acid battery, and the cells have high self-discharge rates.

Sealed Ni–Cd cells were at one time widely used in portable power tools, photography equipment, flashlights, emergency lighting, hobby RC, and portable electronic devices. The superior capacity of nickel–metal hydride batteries, and recent lower cost, has largely supplanted Ni–Cd use. Further, the environmental impact of the disposal of the toxic metal cadmium has contributed considerably to the reduction in their use. Within the European Union, Ni–Cd batteries can now only be supplied for replacement purposes or for certain types of new equipment such as medical devices.

Larger ventilated wet cell Ni–Cd batteries are used in emergency lighting, standby power, and uninterruptible power supplies and other applications.

== History ==
The first Ni–Cd battery was created by Waldemar Jungner of Sweden in 1899. At that time, the only direct competitor was the lead–acid battery, which was less physically and chemically robust. With minor improvements to the first prototypes, energy density rapidly increased to about half of that of primary batteries, and significantly greater than lead–acid batteries. Jungner experimented with substituting iron for the cadmium in varying quantities, but found the iron formulations to be wanting. Jungner&#x27;s work was largely unknown in the United States. Thomas Edison patented a nickel– or cobalt–cadmium battery in 1902, and adapted the battery design when he introduced the nickel–iron battery to the US two years after Jungner had built one. In 1906, Jungner established a factory close to Oskarshamn, Sweden, to produce flooded design Ni–Cd batteries.

In 1932, active materials were deposited inside a porous nickel-plated electrode and fifteen years later work began on a sealed nickel–cadmium battery.
The first production in the United States began in 1946. Up to this point, the batteries were &quot;pocket type,&quot; constructed of nickel-plated steel pockets containing nickel and cadmium active materials. Around the middle of the twentieth century, sintered-plate Ni–Cd batteries became increasingly popular. Fusing nickel powder at a temperature well below its melting point using high pressures creates sintered plates. The plates thus formed are highly porous, about 80 percent by volume. Positive and negative plates are produced by soaking the nickel plates in nickel- and cadmium-active materials, respectively. Sintered plates are usually much thinner than the pocket type, resulting in greater surface area per volume and higher currents. In general, the greater amount of reactive material surface area in a battery, the lower its internal resistance.

Since the 2000s, all consumer Ni–Cd batteries use the jelly-roll configuration.

== Characteristics ==
The maximum discharge rate for a Ni–Cd battery varies by size. For a common AA-size cell, the maximum discharge rate is approximately 1.8 amperes; for a D size battery the discharge rate can be as high as 3.5 amperes.

Model-aircraft or -boat builders often take much larger currents of up to a hundred amps or so from specially constructed Ni–Cd batteries, which are used to drive main motors. 5–6 minutes of model operation is easily achievable from quite small batteries, so a reasonably high power-to-weight figure is achieved, comparable to internal combustion motors, though of lesser duration. In this, however, they have been largely superseded by lithium polymer (LiPo) and lithium iron phosphate (LiFe) batteries, which can provide even higher energy densities.

=== Voltage ===
Ni–Cd cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2 volts (V). This is lower than the 1.5 V of alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells, and consequently they are not appropriate as a replacement in all applications. However, the 1.5 V of a primary alkaline cell refers to its initial, rather than average, voltage. Unlike alkaline and zinc–carbon primary cells, a Ni–Cd cell&#x27;s terminal voltage only changes a little as it discharges. Because many electronic devices are designed to work with primary cells that may discharge to as low as 0.90 to 1.0 V per cell, the relatively steady 1.2 V of a Ni–Cd cell is enough to allow operation. Some would consider the near-constant voltage a drawback as it makes it difficult to detect when the battery charge is low.

Ni–Cd batteries used to replace 9 V batteries usually only have six cells, for a terminal voltage of 7.2 volts. While most pocket radios will operate satisfactorily at this voltage, some manufacturers such as Varta made 8.4 volt batteries with seven cells for more critical applications.

=== Charging ===
Ni–Cd batteries can be charged at several different rates, depending on how the cell was manufactured. The charge rate is measured based on the percentage of the amp-hour capacity the battery is fed as a steady current over the duration of the charge. Regardless of the charge speed, more energy must be supplied to the battery than its actual capacity, to account for energy loss during charging, with faster charges being more efficient. For example, an &quot;overnight&quot; charge, might consist of supplying a current equal to one tenth the ampere-hour rating (C/10) for 14–16 hours; that is, a 100 mAh battery takes 10 mA for 14 hours, for a total of 140 mAh to charge at this rate. At the rapid-charge rate, done at 100% of the rated capacity of the battery in 1 hour (1C), the battery holds roughly 80% of the charge, so a 100 mAh battery takes 125 mAh to charge (that is, approximately 1 hour and fifteen minutes). Some specialized batteries can be charged in as little as 10–15 minutes at a 4C or 6C charge rate, but this is very uncommon. It also greatly increases the risk of the cells overheating and venting due to an internal over-pressure condition: the cell&#x27;s rate of temperature rise is governed by its internal resistance and the square of the charging rate. At a 4C rate, the amount of heat generated in the cell is sixteen times higher than the heat at the 1C rate. The downside to faster charging is the higher risk of overcharging, which can damage the battery. and the increased temperatures the cell has to endure (which potentially shortens its life).

The safe temperature range when in use is between −20 °C and 45 °C. During charging, the battery temperature typically stays low, around the same as the ambient temperature (the charging reaction absorbs energy), but as the battery nears full charge the temperature will rise to 45–50 °C. Some battery chargers detect this temperature increase to cut off charging and prevent over-charging.

When not under load or charge, a Ni–Cd battery will self-discharge approximately 10% per month at 20 °C, ranging up to 20% per month at higher temperatures. Note; year 2022, the preceding sentence was certainly true when NiCad was introduced and even 50 years ago. However continued improvements seen around 40 years ago lead to 5% per month and today the NiCad batteries have substantially lower self-discharge, on the order of 1% or 2% per month. It is possible to perform a trickle charge at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate; to keep a battery fully charged. However, if the battery is going to be stored unused for a long period of time, it should be discharged down to at most 40% of capacity (some manufacturers recommend fully discharging and even short-circuiting once fully discharged), and stored in a cool, dry environment.

=== Overcharging ===
Sealed Ni–Cd cells consist of a pressure vessel that is supposed to contain any generation of oxygen and hydrogen gases until they can recombine back to water. Such generation typically occurs during rapid charge and discharge, and exceedingly at overcharge condition. If the pressure exceeds the limit of the safety valve, water in the form of gas is lost. Since the vessel is designed to contain an exact amount of electrolyte this loss will rapidly affect the capacity of the cell and its ability to receive and deliver current. To detect all conditions of overcharge demands great sophistication from the charging circuit and a cheap charger will eventually damage even the best quality cells.

== Electrochemistry ==
A fully charged Ni–Cd cell contains:
* a nickel(III) oxide-hydroxide positive electrode plate
* a cadmium negative electrode plate
* a separator, and
* an alkaline electrolyte (potassium hydroxide).

Ni–Cd batteries usually have a metal case with a sealing plate equipped with a self-sealing safety valve. The positive and negative electrode plates, isolated from each other by the separator, are rolled in a spiral shape inside the case. This is known as the jelly-roll design and allows a Ni–Cd cell to deliver a much higher maximum current than an equivalent size alkaline cell. Alkaline cells have a bobbin construction where the cell casing is filled with electrolyte and contains a graphite rod which acts as the positive electrode. As a relatively small area of the electrode is in contact with the electrolyte (as opposed to the jelly-roll design), the internal resistance for an equivalent sized alkaline cell is higher which limits the maximum current that can be delivered.

The chemical reactions at the cadmium electrode during discharge are:

:&lt;chem&gt;Cd + 2OH^- -&gt; Cd(OH)2 + 2e^-&lt;/chem&gt;

The reactions at the nickel oxide electrode are:
:&lt;chem&gt;2NiO(OH) + 2H2O + 2e^- -&gt; 2Ni(OH)2 + 2OH^-&lt;/chem&gt;

The net reaction during discharge is
:&lt;chem&gt;Cd + 2Ni(OH)3 -&gt; Cd(OH)2 + 2Ni(OH)2.&lt;/chem&gt;

During recharge, the reactions go from right to left. The alkaline electrolyte (commonly KOH) is not consumed in this reaction and therefore its specific gravity, unlike in lead–acid batteries, is not a guide to its state of charge.

When Jungner built the first Ni–Cd batteries, he used nickel oxide in the positive electrode, and iron and cadmium materials in the negative. It was not until later that pure cadmium metal and nickel hydroxide were used. Until about 1960, the chemical reaction was not completely understood. There were several speculations as to the reaction products. The debate was finally resolved by infrared spectroscopy, which revealed cadmium hydroxide and nickel hydroxide.

Another historically important variation on the basic Ni–Cd cell is the addition of lithium hydroxide to the potassium hydroxide electrolyte. This was believed to prolong the service life by making the cell more resistant to electrical abuse. The Ni–Cd battery in its modern form is extremely resistant to electrical abuse anyway, so this practice has been discontinued.

== Prismatic (industrial) vented-cell batteries ==

Larger flooded cells are used for aircraft starting batteries, standby power and marginally in electric vehicles,

&quot;Vented-cell&quot; (&quot;wet cell&quot;, &quot;flooded cell&quot;) Ni–Cd batteries are used when large capacities and high discharge rates are required. Unlike typical Ni–Cd cells, which are sealed (see next section), vented cells have a vent or low pressure release valve that releases any generated oxygen and hydrogen gases when overcharged or discharged rapidly. Since the battery is not a pressure vessel, it is safer, weighs less, and has a simpler and more economical structure. This also means the battery is not normally damaged by excessive rates of overcharge, discharge or even negative charge.

They are used in aviation, rail and mass transit, backup power for telecoms, engine starting for backup turbines etc. Using vented-cell Ni–Cd batteries results in reduction in size, weight and maintenance requirements over other types of batteries. Vented-cell Ni–Cd batteries have long lives (up to 20 years or more, depending on type) and operate at extreme temperatures (from −40 to 70 °C).

A steel battery box contains the cells connected in series to gain the desired voltage (1.2 V per cell nominal). Cells are usually made of a light and durable polyamide (nylon), with multiple nickel–cadmium plates welded together for each electrode inside. A separator or liner made of silicone rubber acts as an insulator and a gas barrier between the electrodes. Cells are flooded with an electrolyte of 30% aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). The specific gravity of the electrolyte does not indicate if the battery is discharged or fully charged but changes mainly with evaporation of water. The top of the cell contains a space for excess electrolyte and a pressure release vent. Large nickel-plated copper studs and thick interconnecting links assure minimum equivalent series resistance for the battery.

The venting of gases means that the battery is either being discharged at a high rate or recharged at a higher than nominal rate. This also means the electrolyte lost during venting must be periodically replaced through routine maintenance. Depending on the charge–discharge cycles and type of battery this can mean a maintenance period of anything from a few months to a year.

Vented-cell voltage rises rapidly at the end of charge allowing for very simple charger circuitry to be used. Typically a battery is constant current charged at 1 CA rate until all the cells have reached at least 1.55V. Another charge cycle follows at 0.1 CA rate, again until all cells have reached 1.55V. The charge is finished with an equalizing or top-up charge, typically for not less than 4 hours at 0.1 CA rate. The purpose of the over-charge is to expel as much (if not all) of the gases collected on the electrodes, hydrogen on the negative and oxygen on the positive, and some of these gases recombine to form water which in turn will raise the electrolyte level to its highest level after which it is safe to adjust the electrolyte levels. During the over-charge or top-up charge, the cell voltages will go beyond 1.6 V and then slowly start to drop. No cell should rise above 1.71V (dry cell) or drop below 1.55V (gas barrier broken).

In an aircraft installation with a floating battery electrical system the regulator voltage is set to charge the battery at constant potential charge (typically 14 or 28V). If this voltage is set too high it will result in rapid electrolyte loss. A failed charge regulator may allow the charge voltage to rise well above this value, causing a massive overcharge with boiling over of the electrolyte.

== Sealed (portable) cells ==
Most of the uses described below are shown for historical purposes, as sealed (portable) Ni-Cd batteries have progressively been displaced by higher performance Li-ion cells, and their placing on the EU market has, for the most part, been prohibited since 2006 by the 2006/66/EC EU Batteries Directive.

Sealed Ni–Cd cells were used individually, or assembled into battery packs containing two or more cells. Small cells are used for portable electronics and toys (such as solar garden lights), often using cells manufactured in the same sizes as primary cells. When Ni–Cd batteries are substituted for primary cells, the lower terminal voltage and smaller ampere-hour capacity may reduce performance as compared to primary cells. Miniature button cells are sometimes used in photographic equipment, hand-held lamps (flashlight or torch), computer-memory standby, toys, and novelties.

Specialty Ni–Cd batteries were used in cordless and wireless telephones, emergency lighting, and other applications. With a relatively low internal resistance, they can supply high surge currents. This makes them a favourable choice for remote-controlled electric model airplanes, boats, and cars, as well as cordless power tools and camera flash units.

== Popularity ==
Advances in battery-manufacturing technologies throughout the second half of the twentieth century have made batteries increasingly cheaper to produce. Battery-powered devices in general have increased in popularity. As of 2000, about 1.5 billion Ni–Cd batteries were produced annually. Up until the mid-1990s, Ni–Cd batteries had an overwhelming majority of the market share for rechargeable batteries in home electronics.

At one point, Ni–Cd batteries accounted for 8% of all portable secondary (rechargeable) battery sales in the EU, and in the UK for 9.2% (disposal) and in Switzerland for 1.3% of all portable battery sales.

In the EU the 2006 Battery Directive restricted sales of Ni–Cd batteries to consumers for portable devices.

== Availability ==
Ni–Cd cells are available in the same sizes as alkaline batteries, from AAA through D, as well as several multi-cell sizes, including the equivalent of a 9-volt battery. A fully charged single Ni–Cd cell, under no load, carries a potential difference of between 1.25 and 1.35 volts, which stays relatively constant as the battery is discharged. Since an alkaline battery near fully discharged may see its voltage drop to as low as 0.9 volts, Ni–Cd cells and alkaline cells are typically interchangeable for most applications.

In addition to single cells, batteries exist that contain up to 300 cells (nominally 360 volts, actual voltage under no load between 380 and 420 volts). This multi-cell design is mostly used in automotive and heavy-duty industrial applications. For portable applications, the number of cells is normally below 18 cells (24 V). Industrial-sized flooded batteries are available with capacities ranging from 12.5 Ah up to several hundred Ah.

== Comparison with other batteries ==
Recently, nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries have become commercially available and cheaper, the former type now rivaling Ni–Cd batteries in cost. Where energy density is important, Ni–Cd batteries are now at a disadvantage compared with nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. However, the Ni–Cd battery is still very useful in applications requiring very high discharge rates because it can endure such discharge with no damage or loss of capacity.

When compared to other forms of rechargeable battery, the Ni–Cd battery has a number of distinct advantages:

* The batteries are more difficult to damage than other batteries, tolerating deep discharge for long periods. In fact, Ni–Cd batteries in long-term storage are typically stored fully discharged. This is in contrast, for example, to lithium ion batteries, which are less stable and will be permanently damaged if discharged below a minimum voltage.
* The battery performs very well under rough conditions, perfect for use in portable tools.
* Ni–Cd batteries typically last longer, in terms of number of charge/discharge cycles, than other rechargeable batteries such as lead/acid batteries.
* Compared to lead–acid batteries, Ni–Cd batteries have a much higher energy density. A Ni–Cd battery is smaller and lighter than a comparable lead–acid battery, but not a comparable NiMH or Li-ion battery. In cases where size and weight are important considerations (for example, aircraft), Ni–Cd batteries are preferred over the cheaper lead–acid batteries.
* In consumer applications, Ni–Cd batteries compete directly with alkaline batteries. A Ni–Cd cell has a lower capacity than that of an equivalent alkaline cell, and costs more. However, since the alkaline battery&#x27;s chemical reaction is not reversible, a reusable Ni–Cd battery has a significantly longer total lifetime. There have been attempts to create rechargeable alkaline batteries, or specialized battery chargers for charging single-use alkaline batteries, but none that has seen wide usage.
* The terminal voltage of a Ni–Cd battery declines more slowly as it is discharged, compared with carbon–zinc batteries. Since an alkaline battery&#x27;s voltage drops significantly as the charge drops, most consumer applications are well equipped to deal with the slightly lower Ni–Cd cell voltage with no noticeable loss of performance.
* The capacity of a Ni–Cd battery is not significantly affected by very high discharge currents. Even with discharge rates as high as 50C, a Ni–Cd battery will provide very nearly its rated capacity. By contrast, a lead acid battery will only provide approximately half its rated capacity when discharged at a relatively modest 1.5C.
* The maximum continuous current drain of Ni–Cd battery is commonly around 15C. Compared to NiMH battery where usable maximum continuous current drain is not more than 5C.
* Nickel–metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are the newest, and most similar, competitor to Ni–Cd batteries. Compared to Ni–Cd batteries, NiMH batteries have a higher capacity and are less toxic, and are now more cost effective. However, a Ni–Cd battery has a lower self-discharge rate (for example, 20% per month for a Ni–Cd battery, versus 30% per month for a conventional NiMH under identical conditions), although low self-discharge (&quot;LSD&quot;) NiMH batteries are now available, which have substantially lower self-discharge than either Ni–Cd or conventional NiMH batteries. This results in a preference for Ni–Cd over non-LSD NiMH batteries in applications where the current draw on the battery is lower than the battery&#x27;s own self-discharge rate (for example, television remote controls). In both types of cell, the self-discharge rate is highest for a full charge state and drops off somewhat for lower charge states. Finally, a similarly sized Ni–Cd battery has a slightly lower internal resistance, and thus can achieve a higher maximum discharge rate (which can be important for applications such as power tools).

The primary trade-off with Ni–Cd batteries is their higher cost and the use of cadmium. This heavy metal is an environmental hazard, and is highly toxic to all higher forms of life. They are also more costly than lead–acid batteries because nickel and cadmium cost more. One of the biggest disadvantages is that the battery exhibits a very marked negative temperature coefficient. This means that as the cell temperature rises, the internal resistance falls. This can pose considerable charging problems, particularly with the relatively simple charging systems employed for lead–acid type batteries. Whilst lead–acid batteries can be charged by simply connecting a dynamo to them, with a simple electromagnetic cut-out system for when the dynamo is stationary or an over-current occurs, the Ni–Cd battery under a similar charging scheme would exhibit thermal runaway, where the charging current would continue to rise until the over-current cut-out operated or the battery destroyed itself. This is the principal factor that prevents its use as engine-starting batteries. Today with alternator-based charging systems with solid-state regulators, the construction of a suitable charging system would be relatively simple, but the car manufacturers are reluctant to abandon tried-and-tested technology.

== Memory effect ==
Ni–Cd batteries may suffer from a &quot;memory effect&quot; if they are discharged and recharged to the same state of charge hundreds of times. The apparent symptom is that the battery &quot;remembers&quot; the point in its discharge cycle where recharging began and during subsequent use suffers a sudden drop in voltage at that point, as if the battery had been discharged. The capacity of the battery is not actually reduced substantially. Some electronics designed to be powered by Ni–Cd batteries are able to withstand this reduced voltage long enough for the voltage to return to normal. However, if the device is unable to operate through this period of decreased voltage, it will be unable to get enough energy out of the battery, and for all practical purposes, the battery appears &quot;dead&quot; earlier than normal.

There is evidence that the memory effect story originated from orbiting satellites, where they were similarly charging and discharging with every orbit around the Earth over a period of several years. After this time, it was found that the capacities of the batteries had declined significantly, but were still fit for use. It is unlikely that this precise repetitive charging (for example, 1,000 charges/discharges with less than 2% variability) could ever be reproduced by individuals using electrical goods. The original paper describing the memory effect was written by GE scientists at their Battery Business Department in Gainesville, Florida, and later retracted by them, but the damage was done. 

The battery survives thousands of charges/discharges cycles. Also it is possible to lower the memory effect by discharging the battery completely about once a month. This way apparently the battery does not &quot;remember&quot; the point in its charge cycle.

An effect with similar symptoms to the memory effect is the so-called &quot;voltage depression&quot; or &quot;lazy battery effect&quot;. This results from repeated overcharging; the symptom is that the battery appears to be fully charged but discharges quickly after only a brief period of operation. In rare cases, much of the lost capacity can be recovered by a few deep-discharge cycles, a function often provided by automatic battery chargers. However, this process may reduce the shelf life of the battery. If treated well, a Ni–Cd battery can last for 1,000 cycles or more before its capacity drops below half its original capacity. Many home chargers claim to be &quot;smart chargers&quot; which will shut down and not damage the battery, but this seems to be a common problem.

== Environmental impact ==
Ni–Cd batteries contain between 6% (for industrial batteries) and 18% (for commercial batteries) cadmium, which is a toxic heavy metal and therefore requires special care during battery disposal.

In the United States, the expected battery recycling cost (to be used for proper disposal at the end of the service lifetime) is rolled into the battery purchase price.

Under the so-called &quot;batteries directive&quot; (2006/66/EC), the sale of consumer Ni–Cd batteries has now been banned within the European Union except for medical use; alarm systems; emergency lighting; and portable power tools. This last category has been banned effective 2016. Under the same EU directive, used industrial Ni–Cd batteries must be collected by their producers in order to be recycled in dedicated facilities.

<text>Wetzlar () is a city in the state of Hesse, Germany. It is the twelfth largest city in Hesse with currently 55,371 inhabitants at the beginning of 2019 (including second homes). As an important cultural, industrial and commercial center, the university town is one of the ten regional centers in the state of Hesse.
A former free imperial city, it gained much of its fame as the seat of the Imperial Supreme Court (&quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;) of the Holy Roman Empire. Located 51 kilometers north of Frankfurt, at 8° 30′ E, 50° 34′ N, Wetzlar straddles the river Lahn and is on the German Timber-Frame Road, which passes mile upon mile of half-timbered houses. Historically, the city has acted as the hub of the Lahn-Dill-Kreis on the north edge of the Taunus. Tourists know the city for its ancient town and its medieval Catholic/Protestant shared cathedral of St. Mary. Notable architectural features include the Eisenmarkt and the steep gradients and tightly packed street layout of a medieval town. The building of the sandstone cathedral commenced in the 12th century in Romanesque style. In the later Middle Ages the construction continued under a master plan in Gothic style. The church was never finished—one steeple still remains uncompleted. The cathedral suffered heavy damage in the Second World War from aerial bombing, but restoration took place in the 1950s. On the outskirts of town along the river stand the ruins of several stone towers.

The town hosted the &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival twice (the 15th and the 52nd in 1975 and 2012 respectively).

==Geography==
Wetzlar lies in the Lahn-Dill area in Middle Hesse on the river Lahn, not far downstream from where it changes direction from south to west in the heights near the mouth of the Dill. The town lies at a point that divides the low Hessian mountain ranges: south of the Lahn lies the Taunus; north of the Lahn and west of the Dill the Westerwald begins; north of the Lahn and east of the Dill the Rothaargebirge begin. The highest point within town limits is the Stoppelberg at 401 m above sea level.

Wetzlar&#x27;s neighbouring towns and cities are Gießen (up the Lahn from centre to centre about 12 km), Koblenz down the Lahn, Limburg an der Lahn to the west, Siegen to the northwest, Dillenburg to the north, Marburg to the northeast and Frankfurt am Main to the south.

Wetzlar and Gießen are the two cores of this small (about 200,000 inhabitants) urban agglomeration in Middle Hesse. Along the valleys of the Lahn (east and west) and Dill (north) are heavily built-up neighbouring communities, whose built-up areas in some places merge with Wetzlar&#x27;s. The low mountain ranges around Wetzlar to the northwest, northeast and south, on the other hand, are heavily wooded and very thinly populated.

===Neighbouring communities===
Wetzlar borders in the northwest on the town of Aßlar (Lahn-Dill-Kreis), to the north and northeast on the communities of Hohenahr (Lahn-Dill-Kreis) and Biebertal (Gießen district), to the east on the communities of Lahnau (Lahn-Dill-Kreis) and Heuchelheim and the town of Gießen (both in Gießen district), to the south on the communities of Hüttenberg and Schöffengrund and to the west on the town of Solms (all in the Lahn-Dill-Kreis).

===Constituent communities===
The core area of Wetzlar with 30,684 inhabitants is divided into twelve boroughs (&quot;Stadtbezirke&quot;): Altstadt, Neustadt, Hauser Berg, Büblingshausen, Sturzkopf, Stoppelberger Hohl, Nauborner Straße, Silhöfer Aue/Westend, Altenberger Strasse, Dalheim, Dillfeld and Niedergirmes. Niedergirmes is with over 6,000 inhabitants the largest municipality.

Furthermore, there are 8 districts (&quot;Stadtteile&quot;) outside the core area. Five of them have long since been swallowed up in Wetzlar&#x27;s main built-up area. All, however, became part of Wetzlar with the dissolution of the city of Lahn in 1979, excluding Blasbach, Dutenhofen and Münchholzhausen which have long belonged to the city. These are east of the core towns of Naunheim (3882), Garbenheim (2080), Münchholzhausen (2420) and Dutenhofen (3152). Nauborn (3721) is located south of the core area and Steindorf (1704) follows on from the west central area. North of the core area are Blasbach (994) and Hermannstein (3588) (population in brackets, as of 31 December 2007).

===Climate===
Wetzlar has a year-round temperate seasonal climate of the middle latitudes. Between the different elevations there are different small climatic conditions. The daily mean temperature in summer is about and in winter about . The average rainfall is , slightly below the German national average. On the high ground to the south and north of the Lahn valley there is a rainfall of which is exactly the national average. The wettest months are June and December, with and , the driest month is February with .

===Geology===
Wetzlar lies on the eastern edge of the Rhenish Massif. The substrate consists of geologically young sediments of the Lahn and much older Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of the two main geological units of the massif, the Lahnmulde and the so-called Giessen nappe. The northwestern part of the urban area lies on the Lahntal silt, sand and gravel, which have only slightly hardened. They were deposited by the River Lahn, at a point where its valley (which is still up to one kilometre wide) to the west becomes increasingly narrow and deep. The main part of the city is built on in part intensively folded, faulted and slated layers of shales, sandstone, quartzite and limestone. They were deposited in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods in a sea characterised by island chains, volcanoes and atolls that were pushed together and covered by a layer of rock that had been transported from another location during the period of mountain building known as the Variscan orogeny. The marine sedimentary rocks which resulted from this tectonic action now give the town its character as they were often used for building material.

==Demography==
Wetzlar had on 31 December 2005 a municipal census for the city of 52,741 inhabitants (of which 21,946 are male and 24,313 female), 31,022 of which came from the core city (Kernstadt) and 21,719 in the 8 districts. Thus Wetzlar it the eleventh largest city in Hesse. The proportion of foreigners is 11.6% (6371 inhabitants), these are spread over 103 nations. The unemployment rate in the district of the employment agency without the offices of Dillenburg and Wetzlar Biedenkopf (which includes the city of Wetzlar, and 12 surrounding municipalities) was in July 2009 6.9%, which corresponds to 5698 unemployed.

==History==
The town&#x27;s founding date is not known. There were &quot;Bandkeramiker&quot; settlements right on the western town limits, partly from 5,000 years BC.

Iron ore extraction and smelting in and around Wetzlar has been documented as early as the Celtic La Tène period. Iron processing has a tradition of around 2500 years there. There were also pit fields for copper, silver and gold in and around Wetzlar, albeit much later.

In the proximity of Wetzlar there are also a few Roman remains, which were constructed during the reign of the emperor Augustus (reigned 27 BC – 14 AD). There was a military camp at Dorlar and some Roman roadwork. The most important finding however is an uncompleted city (Waldgirmes Forum), which has been excavated since 1993. After their defeat in the battle of the Teutoburg Forest the Romans abandoned the area and withdrew to the Rhine border.

The name &quot;Wetzlar&quot; had come into being most likely by the 3rd century to the 8th century. The last syllable &quot;―lar&quot; suggests that the town was in existence by the 3rd century. The ending may be Celtic or Frankish (in the latter case, most likely referring to wooden defences around the town). The Conradine Gebhard, Count in the Wetterau, and as of 904 Duke of Lorraine, had a Church of the Saviour consecrated in 897, which replaced earlier structures. In the early 10th century came the founding of the &quot;Marienstift&quot; (monastery).

===Free Imperial City===
At some unknown time, Wetzlar was granted market rights, and thereby, the right to levy market dues. Within a year, a market community came into being. The monastery&#x27;s forerunners were surely part of the crystallization point at which believers, traders and craftsmen met, above all on holidays.

The Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1152–1190) created a &quot;Reichsvogtei&quot; (roughly &quot;Imperial Bailiwick&quot;), and in 1180 put Wetzlar&#x27;s citizens on the same level as Frankfurt&#x27;s. Wetzlar became a Free Imperial City and kept this distinction until 1803. For the town&#x27;s protection, and to secure the Wetterau as an Imperial Province, he expanded high above Wetzlar the Imperial Castle (&quot;Reichsburg&quot;), which had most likely already stood in one form or another before then. The origin of the name &quot;Reichsburg Kalsmunt&quot; is not quite clear. The following explanation cannot be ruled out: &quot;Kals-&quot; = &quot;Karls&quot; and &quot;munt&quot; ≈ vassal, that is, a liege of the Frankish court. Thus it would seem to be a case of a building work from Charlemagne&#x27;s time (&quot;Charlemagne&quot; is &quot;Karl der Große&quot; – &quot;Charles the Great&quot; (740s–814) – in German). Imperial coinage was struck at Kalsmunt. The commercial road, which crossed the Lahn at Wetzlar, the town&#x27;s iron production, to which the Iron Market (&quot;forum ferri&quot;) still bears witness, the wool weaving mill and tanning seemed a good basis on which to develop the town further.

In 1285 the &quot;false emperor&quot; Dietrich Holzschuh, called Tile Kolup, who claimed to be Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (who actually had already died in Italy in 1250) came to Wetzlar. When the rightful king, Rudolph I (r. 1273–1291), heard of this and came to Wetzlar, the city leaders seized Tile Kolup and handed him over. He was sentenced as a warlock, a heretic and a blasphemer to a fiery death, which he suffered the next day in Wetzlar at the stake.

Until 1250, most of the town fortifications, whose remains can still be seen today, were complete. By the middle of the 14th century, it is reckoned, the town&#x27;s population was 6,000, making it by the standards of the time a &quot;city&quot;. About 1350, the high point of the town&#x27;s development in the Middle Ages was reached.

Decades-long feuds with the Counts of Solms, who were trying to make Wetzlar into a Solms-domain city, threatened the vital commercial road. The Emperor supported the town, albeit vainly. The city plunged into debt and in 1387 it fell under forced administration; however, it was incorporated into the Swabian League of Towns. The town&#x27;s decline led by the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War to a drop in population, to 1,500.

A stroke of luck came Wetzlar&#x27;s way in 1689 when the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s highest court, the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; (Imperial Chamber Court), was moved from Speyer to Wetzlar after Speyer had been devastated by the French in the War of the Palatinate Succession. Besides Vienna (residence of the Emperor) and Regensburg (seat of the Imperial Diet) Wetzlar thus gained a central function within the Holy Roman Empire and although it remained a tiny town it was regarded as one of its capitals. The court became the town&#x27;s main employer; at the Empire&#x27;s dissolution in 1806, it had a staff of about 150 including 20 judges, while a further 750 derived their income from it.

In the summer of 1772, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was at the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; as a trainee. His novel &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; is inspired by real events which Goethe experienced in Wetzlar. In 1803 Wetzlar came under the rule of Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg, the Archchancellor of the Holy Roman Empire and a close ally of Napoleon Bonaparte and thus lost its status as a free town. With the Empire&#x27;s dissolution in 1806, the great court also met its end. It was replaced by a school of law founded by Karl von Dalberg in 1808, which not only continued the Reichskammergericht&#x27;s function of training constitutional lawyers, but also employed many of the former staff as teachers. A former legal trainee, Franz Stickel (1786–1848), was selected to translate the Code Napoleon that Dalberg introduced in his territories in 1810–11.

After the Congress of Vienna, the area passed to Prussia in 1815, and in 1822 it became the seat of the newly formed district of Wetzlar, which later became an exclave of the Rhine Province.

===Wetzlar becomes an industrial town===
Industrialization began once the Lahn was made into a navigable waterway. With the opening of two railway lines in 1862–1863 (the Lahntal railway from Wetzlar to Koblenz and the Cologne-Gießen Railway, the section through Wetzlar is now called the Dill Railway), which met in Wetzlar, the town found itself connected to raw material and outlet markets, becoming an industrial town. The strategic Cannons Railway, which was completed from Berlin to Metz via Wetzlar in 1882, was also sometimes known as the Wetzlar Railway (&quot;Wetzlarer Bahn&quot;) or Berlin–Wetzlar Railway (&quot;Berlin-Wetzlarer Bahn&quot;).

In 1869, in the municipal area alone, 100 ore mines were in operation. Wetzlar&#x27;s first blast furnace, built by the brothers Buderus, went into service in 1872. As well, world-famous optical and precision mechanics companies such as Leitz (Leica), Hensoldt (Zeiss Optronics in the past, now Airbus), Pfeiffer Vacuum, Philips, Loh, Seibert, Hollmann, Minox and many others set up shop in the town.

For more than one hundred years, the iron ore found in the Lahn-Dill area (haematite) was processed at the &quot;Sophienhütte&quot; ironworks. As of 1887, iron ore mines were being shut down one by one, interrupted only by the First World War, because foreign ore from strip mines was being offered at lower prices on the world market. In 1926, mining came to an end altogether.

===Wetzlar in the 20th century===
As part of the progressing industrialization, the town outgrew its mediaeval town limits. In 1903 came the amalgamation of Niedergirmes with its extensive industrial works and the railway station neighbourhood. By the end of the First World War, the population had risen to over 15,000. Owing to increasing transportation problems, a ringroad was built to the west of the Old Town (Altstadt), taking the load off the old stone bridge across the Lahn by building a further bridge. In the Second World War, the town, being an industrial stronghold, also became the target of heavy bombing, which destroyed much of the railway station neighbourhood and Niedergirmes. The historic Old Town, however, was mostly spared from the air raids.

After the Second World War ended in 1945, Wetzlar found itself in the American occupation zone, and later, once new boundaries had been drawn, in the Federal State of Hesse. By the beginning of the 1950s, owing to the huge numbers of displaced people from lost territories and refugees flooding into the town, the population had doubled to 30,000.

On 1 January 1977, as part of Hesse&#x27;s municipal reforms, Wetzlar was united with the neighbouring town of Gießen and fourteen outlying communities to form the city of Lahn. This district-free city had about 156,000 inhabitants. The amalgamation was very unpopular, and after persistent protests – not least of all from Wetzlar – the city of Lahn was dissolved on 31 July 1979, and Wetzlar once again became an independent town. The municipal reforms, however, had been &quot;worth the trouble&quot; for Wetzlar inasmuch as the town gained eight new outlying communities in the deal, making both the town&#x27;s area and population considerably greater than they had been. Moreover, Wetzlar has since this time been the seat of the Lahn-Dill-Kreis, which also came into being at the same time.

==Politics==

=== Town council ===

Elections to the town council were last held on 26 March 2006 for a five-year term. The SPD lost one seat, the Greens gained one. Voter participation fell from 45.9% in 2001 to 37.2%. Out of 38,918 eligible voters, 14,468 went to the polls. Hesse&#x27;s next municipal elections will be held in March 2011.


The majority of seats, and thereby the power, is held by a CDU-FWG-FDP coalition which holds, as also before the elections, 31 of the 59 seats.

===&quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;===

=== Coat of arms ===
Wetzlar&#x27;s civic coat of arms might heraldically be described thus: In gules a spreadeagle sable armed, langued and crowned Or, over its wing dexter a cross pattée argent.

The black Imperial eagle on a red background and with a golden crown stands for the town&#x27;s former Imperial immediacy as a Free Imperial City (see History). The silver cross stands for the former Imperial City&#x27;s right to mint coins. The arms are almost unchanged from those borne in the 12th century.

A new version of the coat of arms was to have been introduced in 2003, but it did not catch on. In the end, the &quot;old&quot; arms were kept.

==Transport==
; Motorways
: Wetzlar lies on the A45 (Sauerland-line Dortmund – Aschaffenburg) with the junctions Wetzlarer Kreuz [Wetzlar Cross] (to A480 to Wetzlar-North, Asslar and Wetzlar-Blasbach), Wetzlar-Ost [Wetzlar-East] (to B49 in direction city centre) and Wetzlar-Süd [Wetzlar-South] (into the southern quarters Münchholzhausen and Dutenhofen). The motorway A480 should actually lead from the Luxembourg border over Trier through the Westerwald up to the Hattenbacher Dreieck ([Hattenbach Triangle] to the A7). This distance was planned as A48. Because of high costs it was never completely realized. Now the B49 are to take up the traffic. Today the part of the A48 between Gießen and Wetzlar is called A480 and leads only from the departure Wetzlar-North/Asslar up to the Wetzlarer Cross and beyond that up to the present motorway end with the improvised exit after Wetzlar-Blasbach. Some kilometres to the northeast of Gießen the part removed so far continues and leads from Heuchelheim to the Reiskirchener Dreieck [Reiskirchen Triangle] at the A5.
; Federal highways
: The following federal highways lead through the city: B49 (Trier – Wetzlar – Alsfeld) in direction east–west and B277 (Siegen-Dillenburg-Wetzlar) as north-south connection. The B277a is rather a bypass road, it connects Asslar with Wetzlar-Dalheim. Between Wetzlar and Limburg (B49) the federal route is currently being expanded from one lane to two in each direction.
; Railways
: Wetzlar lies on the railroad lines Frankfurt am Main – Siegen – Cologne and Gießen – Limburg – Koblenz, which meet at Wetzlar station and are operated by RegionalBahn and RegionalExpress-trains. Since 2009 every morning and evening a EuroCity stops on its way to Klagenfurt or rather to Siegen. Beside the station Wetzlar, a further station exists in Dutenhofen. The earlier station in Wetzlar-Garbenheim was closed when this route to Wetzlar was shut down. The freight station has become smaller; since February 2007, Railion operates freight trains for central Hesse. Larger cities, which are directly reachable from Wetzlar are: Aachen, Cologne, Koblenz, Frankfurt am Main, Munich, Salzburg, Siegen and Stuttgart.
; Public transport
: The city has a well organised urban bus network with twelve lines, all connecting to the central bus station (ZOB), in addition various lines handle the overland traffic into the surrounding countryside of Wetzlar. In the late evening hours the night bus line 007, the so-called &quot;DiscoBus&quot;, serves nearly all parts of the city. On all lines, the RMV pricing applies. Additionally the &quot;CityBus&quot; links the Old Town for 50c, weekdays from 10:00 to 19:00 and on workdays to 15:00 with the station and the shopping centre &quot;FORUM Wetzlar&quot; every 20 minutes.
; Airports
: The distance to Frankfurt Airport is about , to the regional airport Siegen approx. .

==Economy and business==
=== Retailing ===
According to the figures of the Society for Consumer Research Wetzlar is one of the most attractive commercial locations in Germany. The city has a high centrality coefficient and a retail turnover of around EUR 10,000 per inhabitant. In Germany it takes third place among all cities with over 50,000 inhabitants.

Wetzlar has two large shopping centres, of those the &quot;FORUM Wetzlar&quot; is the largest in central Hesse (&quot;Mittelhessen&quot;). It has around 110 shops and accommodates a large multi-storey car park of 1700 places. Retail trade is located mainly in the areas &quot;Bahnhofsstraße&quot;, &quot;Karl-Kellner-Ring&quot; and the historic old town. In the Bahnhofstraße, the Karl-Kellner-Ring and in the two shopping centres where almost all goods are available.

===Enterprises===
The city is home to some internationally active and well known enterprises. The Buderus company was created in the year 1731 and is one of the oldest still existing (large) enterprises. As BBT Thermotechnik, now part of the Bosch group, Buderus was for many decades one of the largest employers in the central Hessian area with more than 10,000 persons employed in Wetzlar alone (worldwide over 16,000), working in the areas casting (with cement), high-grade steel and heating technologies. Economic changes, repeated shifts of the stock majority as well as close-downs and sales of various divisions have strongly changed the company in the meantime. However, it ranks among the largest enterprises in Hesse. Wetzlar is apart from Jena and Oberkochen a German centre for optics as well as the most important German location for the precision engineering industry. The manufactured products have gained worldwide reputation. One of the most important companies in the area of microscopy is Leica Microsystems (formerly known as Ernst Leitz), which in its peak times employed over 7000 people in the city. Small format (35 mm) photography was invented in Wetzlar, and Leica cameras are well known for their excellent quality. In addition there are cameras of the companies Leidolf and Minox, binoculars and telescopes made by the company Hensoldt AG (now Carl Zeiss), part of the Zeiss group (over 2,000 people employed in peak times). Other well-known firms are Philips (with about 1,200 employed at times) or Siemens AG and Siemens VDO, since 2007 Continental AG or the Sancura BKK, a supraregional health insurance company, which is combined with the Taunus BKK. The Business park &quot;Spilburg&quot;, former barracks, became home to a number of innovative enterprises, particularly in the area of optics/precision mechanics, information technology and services. Additionally, areas in the &quot;Westend&quot; as well as the &quot;Hörnsheimer Eck&quot; and the &quot;Dillfeld&quot; are available for new businesses to set up.

== Education system ==
Wetzlar offers a wide variety of educational paths students can choose from. 

=== Nurseries ===
Traditionally a child&#x27;s education starts in one of Wetzlar&#x27;s 18 nurseries. There are public and private nurseries and religiously influenced ones. Children will spend between one and four years in one of these day cares, until they move on to an elementary school.

=== Elementary school ===
Wetzlar has around 12 elementary schools. This includes private schools and schools, who are dedicated to special needs children. Most elementary schools offer an afterschool day care program for students, whose parents are at work longer than the school day. In addition to these programs, the city has public day care facilities that provide afterschool care. The afterschool program consists of warm meals, tutors who help with homework and playtime. Kita Marienheim is an example. After spending four years in elementary school, students are off to middle school.

=== Secondary school ===
The middle (secondary) school system in Germany is quite extravagant, Wetzlar being no exception. There are three branches of middle school. The Gymnasium (comparable to A-Levels), Realschule (normal secondary school) and Hauptschule (lowest secondary school). Wetzlar has four secondary schools. The August-Bebel-Gesamtschule and the Eichendorfschule are so-called Gesamtschulen. They offer all three branches of secondary school. The Freiherr-vom-Stein Schule is a gymnasium (A-Level). The Steinschule recently changed from a G8 program, graduation after Grade 9, to a G9 program, graduation after Grade 10. It has a special program dedicated to science and sports classes. When applying to the school, students can decide if they&#x27;d like to join a sports class, a science class or a regular class. If they join a special class they will enjoy benefits, such as a whole day dedicated to their chosen subject (science or sports) and different fieldtrips. Next to the Steinschule is the Schule an der Brühlsbacher Warte. It is a school for special needs children. It is specialized in helping children with disabilities learn basic and career relevant skills.

After completing Grade 5 to Grade 10 students now make important future decisions. They can now choose an apprenticeship, higher education, work, take a year off and many more. Most students choose to pursue their education and go to one of Wetzlar&#x27;s High Schools.

=== Upper secondary education ===
Wetzlar is home to three upper secondary schools. The Käthe-Kollwitz Schule is a vocational center, which is specialized in nutrition, health, personal hygiene, and social affairs. The school is named after Mrs. Käthe Kollwitz (1919–1945), a German artist. The Thedor-Heuss-Schule Wetzlar is a &#x27;Fachhochschule&#x27; or &#x27;kaufmännische Berufsschule&#x27;, which can be roughly translated into &#x27;commercial vocational school&#x27;. They primarily focus on health and economic education. It is named after the first Federal President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Theodor Heuss (1884–1963). Named after the Johann Wolfang Goethe (1749–1832), a famous German writer and statesman, the Goetheschule Wetzlar it is the biggest upper secondary school in Hesse with over 1000 students and ca. 110 staff members. It is well known for its varieties of subjects and extracurricular activities, such as multiple language exchanges and class fieldtrips.

Before 2019 all three schools were sharing one facility that consisted of three smaller buildings connected by hallways, a shared auditorium and kiosk. Shortly before the new school year in 2019, the Goetheschule Wetzlar moved into a separate building. The old one was demolished, and the construction of the new school facility began. It is expected to be completed in 2021.

=== Higher education ===
The Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen is one of the largest universities of applied sciences in Germany. The campus in Wetzlar is located in a redeveloped former military barracks area. The Zentrum Dualer Hochschulstudien (ZDH) has been offering the StudiumPlus since 25 April 2001. StudiumPlus is a dual university degree, which is a cooperation between the TH Mittelhessen and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce. The cooperation includes over 1000 partner companies in the region. The dual study currently consists of seven bachelor&#x27;s degree programs such as business administration, engineering / mechanical engineering, engineering / electrical engineering, civil engineering, software technology, organizational management in medicine and industrial engineering as well as the three master&#x27;s degree programs in process management, systems engineering and technical sales.

==Sightseeing==

=== Historic Old Town ===
The tightly woven ensemble of historic buildings and houses in the Old Town (&quot;Altstadt&quot;) with its half-timbered houses and stone buildings from Romanesque (Wetzlar Cathedral) to Gothic to Renaissance and Baroque is to a great extent as it was in the late 18th century, preserved and extensively restored. Thus the great squares of &quot;Buttermarkt/Domplatz&quot; (&quot;Butter Market/Cathedral Square&quot;), &quot;Fischmarkt&quot; (&quot;Fish Market&quot;), &quot;Eisenmarkt&quot; (&quot;Iron Market&quot;), &quot;Kornmarkt&quot; (&quot;Grain Market&quot;), and the former &quot;Franziskanerhof&quot; (&quot;Franciscan Yard&quot;), now called &quot;Schillerplatz&quot;. From the roughly 50 noteworthy buildings, a few are listed here:

* A straight-walled half-timbered house from 1356
* The &quot;Old Coin&quot; (&quot;Alte Münze&quot;) at the Iron Market
* The &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; (&quot;Römische Kaiser&quot;) from the 15th century, a former theatre and ballroom
* The former Teutonic Knights&#x27; Court (&quot;Deutschordenshof&quot;), today a town museum
* The &quot;Lottehaus&quot;, Charlotte Buff&#x27;s house
* The &quot;Jerusalemhaus&quot; in which Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem shot himself, thus attaining sad fame as Werther
* The princely &quot;Palais Papius&quot; in which is nowadays found the collection of historical furniture assembled by Dr Irmgard Freiin von Lemmers-Danforth

Also in the old outlying towns of Langgasse and Neustadt (&quot;New Town&quot;), connected to the Old Town by the Old Lahn Bridge (&quot;Alte Lahnbrücke&quot;), a number of historic buildings are preserved and are worth seeing. The New Town, however, has lost its mediaeval feel owing to its 20th-century four-lane roads.

The stone &quot;Alte Lahnbrücke&quot; was first mentioned in 1288. A building meant to serve as the town hall, built in the mid 14th century, was used by the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; as their seat and offices from 1689 to 1806, after many remodellings. Considerable remains of the town&#x27;s 13th- and 14th-century fortifications are still preserved, for instance a fortress tower known as the &quot;Schneiderturm&quot; (&quot;Tailor&#x27;s Tower&quot;) or &quot;Säuturm&quot; (&quot;Sow&#x27;s Tower&quot;), the &quot;Kalsmuntpforte&quot; (&quot;Kalsmunt Gate&quot; – see History) which was the town gate for the earlier suburb of Silhofen, as well as large sections of the town wall.

====Wetzlar Cathedral====

The &quot;Wetzlarer Dom&quot; (Wetzlar Cathedral) is one of Wetzlar&#x27;s landmark buildings. Building work began on the cathedral in 1230 and is still not finished. It is the successor to a former &quot;Church of the Saviour&quot; consecrated in 897. The monastery and parish church was called Cathedral as of the late 17th century. This designation was acquired during the time that the &quot;Reichskammergericht&quot; was active in Wetzlar (1693–1806), when the Elector-Archbishop of Trier was Monastery Provost, making the church a &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Church&quot;.

==Culture==
The Phantastische Bibliothek Wetzlar (Fantastic Library of Wetzlar) is one of the largest public libraries specialising in fantastic literature worldwide, it is the largest in Europe. It is generally a reference library, open for the public and scientists.

Arena Wetzlar is a multi-functional arena and is primarily used for pop concerts, shows and team handball and is the home arena of HSG Wetzlar (Handball Bundesliga).

Every summer, operas, music and drama are performed in the open air at the &quot;Freilichtbühne&quot; during the month-long &quot;Wetzlar Festival&quot; (&quot;Wetzlarer Festspiele&quot;).

<text>Yolanda Rosa Monge Betancourt (born September 16, 1955), known professionally as Yolandita Monge, is a Puerto Rican singer, actress, and television personality. She has been active in the music business since her teen years and has recorded 27 studio albums and two live albums, as well as several greatest hits compilations and special appearance recordings.

==Biography==

===Early life and family===
Monge was born in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico on September 16, 1955, is the daughter of Iris Delia Betancourt and Héctor Monge. She lived the first seven years of her life in New York City and then came back to Puerto Rico. During the early 70s, she met Alfredo Lorenzo, in New York, and married him on November 13, 1975. They had a daughter, Noelia, but the marriage ended soon afterwards. In 1983, she married Venezuelan singer Balbino, whom she met in Buga, Colombia, and is the father of second daughter Paola González. A few years later, the couple filed for divorce. On December 31, 1989, Yolandita married her manager Carlos &quot;Topy&quot; Mamery and in 1991 gave birth to her only son Imanol Mamery.

===Early career===

Blessed with a powerful and versatile vocal range and timbre, Monge started out her career by winning a singing radio contest in 1966 (at the age of eleven). For such a young performer, she possessed an innate interpretative delivery well beyond her years that matched established performers of the time.

Yolandita was discovered by the producer Julio Alers, and later on, made her TV debut on Luis Vigoreaux&#x27;s show, &quot;Luis Vigoreaux Presenta&quot;. She had a regular section in that show. In 1968, she signed with record label Patty Records, which released her first album, named &quot;Puerto Rico&#x27;s Poignant... Powerful... Incomparable...&quot;.

It was &quot;El Estornudo&quot; (&quot;The Sneeze&quot;), and her cover of Italian hit &quot;Vida&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Life&quot;), that made her a national star after she released her first album. At that young age, Yolandita would perform with legendary Argentinian singer Libertad Lamarque and then sing at the &quot;Festival De La Canción Nueva York&quot; (New York Song Festival). Soon, she found another job on TV, this time on Tommy Muñiz&#x27;s show, &quot;El Show Del Mediodía&quot;.

She followed up with some other hits in Puerto Rico, but then she moved to Mexico, where she signed with Teca Records and had hits such as &quot;Vete de Aqui&quot; (&quot;Get Out of Here&quot;), &quot;Dos Caminos Diferentes&quot; (&quot;Two Different Ways&quot;), &quot;¿Por qué, Papá?&quot; (&quot;Why, Dad?&quot;) and &quot;La Voz Del Silencio&quot; (&quot;The Voice of Silence&quot;).

===International breakthrough===

1975 was a big year for Monge because she released a song named &quot;Cierra Los Ojos&quot; (&quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;), which was a hit in such South American countries as Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina, and also in the Dominican Republic. Yolandita was now an international star.

Soon after, she would be signed by Coco Records of New York, and her career kept going on a steady rise internationally. She sang at the Carnegie Hall and was backed up by her artistic godmother, legendary Argentinian singer and actress, Libertad Lamarque.

=== International success: 1980s ===

In 1980, international label CBS Records International, (now Sony Discos), signed her up into their line-up. &quot;Tanto Amor&quot; (So much love) composed by Lou Briel, was the first hit song of that album named &quot;Fantasia&quot; produced by Pepe Luis Soto. She then released another album &quot;Historia de Amour&quot; which included many top hits. In 1983, she won the Buga Festival, in Buga, Colombia with a song that she wrote her self called &quot;Sí&quot; (Yes). Her next release in 1983, Sueños, continued her ascent as one of the most important and best selling female singers in Puerto Rico. This album marked a radical change in sound and image for Monge, moving towards the Latin pop tendencies of the time while keeping her interpretative delivery.

Monge continued her winning stride in the middle 1980s, when she released what possibly is one of her greatest album ever: &quot;Luz de Luna&quot; (Moonlight). This album included her classics &quot;Te Veo Pasar&quot; (I See You Walk By), &quot;Señor Del Pasado&quot; (Man from the Past), and &quot;El Poder del Amor&quot;, which was a cover of the popular song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (most recently recorded by Céline Dion). With this album, she became the first Puerto Rican female singer to earn a gold record.

She followed up that album with the equally successful &quot;Laberinto de Amor&quot; (Labyrinth of Love), which earned her another gold album and later went platinum. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award, years before the Latin Grammy was created. In this album, she sang a Spanish version of &quot;On My Own&quot; (&quot;Solo Yo&quot;) which is a song from the soundtrack of the famous Broadway musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. Yolandita was a household name. This album earned her a Grammy nomination in the Best Latin Pop artist category. With this nomination she became the first Puerto Rican female singer to be nominated to the Grammy Music Awards, joined by fellow Puerto Rican singer Lunna, as well in the same category. The album also went gold in many countries including the United States.

In 1988, she achieved multi platinum level sales with her album, &quot;Vivencias&quot;. Yolandita considers this album the best and most important album of her career. This release included such songs as: &quot;Acariciame&quot; (&quot;Caress Me&quot;) and &quot;Este Amor Que Hay Que Callar&quot; (&quot;This Love That We Must Keep Quiet&quot;) composed for her by the Spanish singer and author Braulio. She became the first Puerto Rican singer to win a gold album record, a platinum record and a double platinum.

Yolandita was claimed by the America&#x27;s music magazine &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1988 as &quot;The best-selling Latin artist of the year&quot; due to being the first Puerto Rican female artist to sell millions of records. She also was claimed by the international music press as &quot;The most important Latin singer of the decade&quot; (1980–1990). NBC traveled all the way to Puerto Rico to interview Yolandita because they consider her the most relevant artist of the Latin music industry and she was even compared with Madonna. In the interview the reporter said: &quot;Yolandita has no plans to make the crossover, so Madonna can relax.&quot;

After the huge success of &quot;Vivencias&quot;, she changed gears in terms of music style and released &quot;Portfolio&quot; in the summer of 1990, with the help of Venezuelan singer Ricardo Montaner which was one of the producers and songwriters. With Portfolio, she performed nine sold-out concerts at Puerto Rico&#x27;s Centro de Bellas Artes (making a new record on sales), and at the Madison Square Garden. During her performances at the Centro de Bellas Artes, Yolandita became the first Latin performer, and one of the earliest recording artists, to use a wireless headset microphone, allowing her to dance while she sang.

After more than ten years at Sony Latin, Yolandita signed a multimillion-dollar recording contract with WEA-Latina, the first for a female pop artist in Puerto Rico. The first release was &quot;Cara de Ángel&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Portfolio&quot;. It contains the radio hits &quot;Sobreviviré&quot;, &quot;Viviré Sin Tí&quot;, and &quot;Entrega Total&quot;. In May 1992, for the &quot;Cara de Angel Tour&quot;, Yolandita established a new record at the Performing Arts Center of Puerto Rico (Centro de Bellas Artes), becoming the biggest singer selling out all the concerts, without courtesy tickets, up to 12 concerts of the same tour, breaking her own record. Also in 1992, Yolandita was invited by Spanish Tenor, Plácido Domingo, to be part of a Special Tribute to the artist Goya, the tribute was a special-release album. Yolandita also released her first Christmas album in 1992 titled &quot;Mi Mejor Regalo&quot;.

In 1994, she became the first Puerto Rican female to land a commercial deal with Pepe Jeans London and also for Diet Pepsi. During that year, Monge released Fiebre de Luna, along with a change of image. The hit album included compositions from Las Diego and produced the hit singles &quot;A Pesar del Tiempo&quot; and &quot;Como Puedes&quot;. She teamed with singer Ricardo Montaner to do a concert and they earned a Guinness World Records as becoming the first singers to perform 3 concerts in 3 different cities (Mayagüez, Ponce and San Juan) – all in the same day. This could be done, using air transportation by helicopter. It was called: &quot;El Suceso&quot; (The Event).

In 1995, Yolandita released the self-titled &quot;Yolandita&quot;, along with another change in image with long hair and a belly ring. Right after, Monge relocated to Colombia to act in telenovela alongside Puerto Rican actor Osvaldo Ríos. Yolandita was honored in 1996 by the Puerto Rican Senate for her long career as a singer and actress. She also earned two of the most prestigious awards of the Latin music industry, Premios Lo Nuestro and Premios Tu Música. Also in 1996, she participated in the annual music video special, produced by Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, dedicated to Pedro Flores, which usually includes only the most important and international singers the island has to offer.

In 1997, Yolandita released &quot;Mi Encuentro&quot;, which included bomba and plena, a Puerto Rican rhythm. The album was a hit and cemented the singer&#x27;s ability to tacke any kind of music. The singer returned with another change of image and to her signature strong ballads with the album &quot;Siento&quot; in early 1999. The album was certified gold and included the hits &quot;Dime&quot;, &quot;Arriesgaré la Piel&quot; and &quot;Mala Sangre&quot;.

=== 2000–present ===

In late 2000, Yolandita released her second live album &quot;Yolandita En Vivo&quot; recorded at Centro de Bellas Artes of Puerto Rico. It included many of her early hits and the duet &quot;Sobrevivire&quot; with her second daughter Paola González.

Yolandita took some time off and returned with &quot;Sexto Sentido&quot; in 2002, which included a collaboration with her eldest daughter and singer Noelia. This album was produced by Colombian producer Kike Santander and was certified gold. After that, the singer took a lengthy hiatus from recording to pursue other acting opportunities.

In 2004 she conducted her TV show for Telemundo called &quot;De Mujeres&quot; (&quot;Of Women&quot;). In this variety show she performed comedy skits and interviewed both local and international stars. She also sang with Julieta Venegas, Luis Fonsi, Lucecita Benítez, Víctor Manuelle, Chucho Avellanet, Gilberto Santa Rosa, La India, Gisselle, Lissette, Tito Nieves, Dagmar, Andy Montañez, Danny Rivera, and many more. These performances were once-in-a-lifetime duets that graced Puerto Rico&#x27;s silver screen and kept the captive audience that followed the show wanting more.

After five years of not releasing a new album, Monge released on June 5, 2007, her album &quot;Demasiado Fuerte&quot;. It debuted number one in Billboard Latin Pop Albums making her return to music one of the greatest comebacks ever seen in the Latin Market. The album was produced by José Luis Pagán and Jorge Luis Piloto. Also, the album included the hits &quot;Y Todavia&quot; and the title track, &quot;Demasiado Fuerte&quot;, both of which were remixed in reggaeton style and became hits in the urban radio stations in Puerto Rico and the Latin communities in United States. In November 2007, Yolandita returned to Centro de Bellas Artes with five sold-out concerts in support of the &quot;Demasiado Fuerte&quot; album. The singer received the best reviews of her career with those performances, which included duets with guest Glenn Monroig.

On October 6, 2008, Monge debuted the single &quot;Mala&quot;. Immediately, on November 22, 2008, Yolandita released the album &quot;Mala&quot;, produced once again by José Luis Pagán and following the same musical and lyrical style as her previous &quot;Demasiado Fuerte&quot;. This album contains the song &quot;Oportunidad Perdida&quot; featuring Víctor Manuelle, which was re-recorded with Anthony Ríos in bachata style. Also, the song &quot;Mala&quot; was remixed in reggaeton style featuring Ivy Queen and in salsa style featuring La India. The song &quot;Una y Otra Vez&quot; was remixed in reggaeton style featuring Divino.

After the success of those radio remixes, Yolandita recorded a remix single with reggaeton artist Tito el Bambino called &quot;El Amor&quot;, which used her same-titled smash hit from the 80s to his version. The song made it to the No. 1 spot in the Hot Latin Songs &quot;Billboard&quot; Chart.

On September 11, 2010, Yolandita debuted at Coliseo de Puerto Rico in the concert &quot;20 Años de Vivencias&quot;, celebrating the twenty year anniversary of the release of her iconic album &quot;Vivencias&quot;. She performed the vast majority of her hits of the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s, and 90&#x27;s, as well as her current repertoire. Soon after, Yolandita returned to Centro de Bellas Artes in April 2011, for a once-in-a-lifetime sold-out concert accompanied by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Puerto Rico, as part of the thirty year anniversary celebration of the venue. All the songs were deconstructed and performed acoustically.

During 2012, Yolandita was one of three judges in &quot;Idol Puerto Rico&quot;, along with her husband Carlos &#x27;Topy&#x27; Mamery and Ricardo Montaner during the second season of the program.

On November 13, 2012, Yolandita released her new album Más Para Dar, with lyrics written by herself and José Luis Pagán. The album was produced by José Luis Pagán and it follows the same musical and lyrical style as her previous records. Yolandita returned to Coliseo de Puerto Rico for the &quot;Más Para Dar Tour&quot; on March 16, 2013. Beginning in the Dominican Republic, this concert tour visited cities in the United States, Puerto Rico and Latin America. In the concerts at Santo Domingo, Yolandita shared the stage with Danny Rivera.

On December 3, 2014, her husband and manager of more than twenty years, Carlos &#x27;Topy&#x27; Mamery, died of a massive heart attack. The funeral was held on December 5, 2014, alongside hundreds of fans, friends and family members. After that tragedy, Yolandita retired from public view for the following months of 2015.

On September 20, 2015, Yolandita returned to the concert stage after nine months of mourning at Coliseo de Puerto Rico for &quot;Latidos de mi Corazón&quot;, a tribute to her late husband Carlos &#x27;Topy&#x27; Mamery. She performed some of her hits and her new digital single Sin Tí, a song written by Las Diego, as well as other love songs from other artists. Her children, Imanol and Paola, joined her on stage for two songs, as well as some relatives of the Mamery and Monge families for the encore. On May 28, 2016, she presented the concert &quot;Latidos de mi Corazón&quot; at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts in New York for her many fans there.

Yolandita recorded a jazz version of the Latin American standard &quot;Cuando Vuelva A Tu Lado&quot; for Humberto Ramírez&#x27;s new album &quot;Bohemia Jazz&quot;, released on January 27, 2016. The album contains other songs performed by Nydia Caro, Chucho Avellanet, Dagmar, Michelle Brava, Andy Montañez and Carola Ausbury. The singer was one of many artists that performed at the Fiestas de la Calle San Sebastián in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 2016, 2017 &amp; 2018.

On May 13, 14 &amp; 27, 2017, Yolandita teamed for the first time with Lissette Alvarez for a three sold-out performances at Centro de Bellas Artes of Caguas for the concert &quot;Emociones&quot;. She sang her most beloved hits along with duets with Lissette Alvarez. The singers performed together the hits &quot;Hoy Vine Con Ella&quot;, &quot;Cantaré&quot;, &quot;El Amor&quot; and &quot;Gracias a la Vida&quot;, as well as sharing a medley of both their greatest hits.

Yolandita returned to Centro de Bellas Artes for five sold-out performances of the new show &quot;Por Tí&quot; on December 6, 7 &amp; 8, 2019 and February 14 &amp; 15, 2020. Monge performed all her greatest hits including a new version of the 1989 club hit Por Ti and several other songs in an a cappella sing-along with the audience.

Monge has had a very distinguished acting career, she&#x27;s acted in more than ten Spanish soap operas, as well as various theatre plays and TV shows. Among the telenovelas, she acted in: &quot;Vida&quot; (&quot;Life&quot;), (where she performed with Johanna Rosaly), &quot;La Mentira&quot; (&quot;The Lie&quot;), &quot;Poquita Cosa&quot; (&quot;Small Thing&quot;), &quot;Escándalo&quot; (&quot;Scandal&quot;) (where she acted alongside Andrés García, Iris Chacón and Charytín), and Ave de Paso (&quot;Bird of Passage&quot;), where she played the main role, and sang the theme song: &quot;Nunca Te Diré Adiós&quot;, composed for her by Lou Briel. This song was a big hit in 1989, and it was included in a Special Edition Album: &quot;Yolandita Monge Live from New York&quot;. She also acted in the original version of the Colombian mega-hit soap opera, &quot;La Viuda de Blanco&quot; along with Osvaldo Ríos, Maria Helena Doehring, Jorge Enrique Abello and Danilo Santos. From 1996 to 1997, this soap opera was translated in more than 32 languages. Her theatrical debut was in &quot;La Visita de la Bestia&quot;, which is a Spanish version of &quot;Extremities&quot;, and she got good reviews from the press by playing the very dramatic main role. She also earned international recognition playing the Greek-soprano, Maria Callas, in the Spanish version of the Tony Award winner play &quot;Master Class&quot; (Clase Maestra) in 2003, for the Latin community in the United States and Latin America. Yolandita made all the critics bow when they saw her rendition of the late-diva. A year later she landed the lead female role in the musical &quot;La Verdadera Historia de Pedro Navaja&quot; (&quot;The True Story of Pedro Navaja&quot;), opposite Gilberto Santa Rosa. For her performance as &quot;Diana la Maromera&quot; (Diana the Juggler), in this musical, she got good reviews.

<text>Old World vultures are vultures that are found in the Old World, i.e. the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa, and which belong to the family Accipitridae, which also includes eagles, buzzards, kites, and hawks.

Old World vultures are not closely related to the superficially similar New World vultures and condors, and do not share that group&#x27;s good sense of smell. The similarities between the two groups of vultures are due to convergent evolution, rather than a close relationship. They were widespread in both the Old World and North America during the Neogene.
Old World vultures are probably a polyphyletic group within Accipitridae, belonging to two separate not closely related groups within the family. Most authorities refer to two major clades: [[Gypaetinae]] (&quot;Gypaetus, Gypohierax&quot; and &quot;Neophron&quot;) and Aegypiinae (&quot;Aegypius&quot;, &quot;Gyps&quot;, &quot;Sarcogyps&quot;, &quot;Torgos&quot;, &quot;Trigonoceps&quot; and possibly &quot;Necrosyrtes&quot;). The former seem to be nested with Perninae hawks, while the latter are closely related and possibly even synonymous with Aquilinae. Within Aegypiinae, &quot;Torgos&quot;, &quot;Aegypius&quot;, &quot;Sarcogyps&quot; and &quot;Trigonoceps&quot; are particularly closely related and possibly within the same genus. Despite the name of the group, &quot;Old World&quot; vultures were widespread in North America until relatively recently, until the end of the Late Pleistocene epoch around 11,000 years ago.

Both Old World and New World vultures are scavenging birds, feeding mostly from carcasses of dead animals. Old World vultures find carcasses exclusively by sight. A particular characteristic of many vultures is a semi-bald head, sometimes without feathers or with just simple down. Historically, it was thought that this was due to feeding habits, as feathers would be glued with decaying flesh and blood. However, more recent studies have shown that it is actually a thermoregulatory adaptation to avoid facial overheating; the presence or absence of complex feathers seems to matter little in feeding habits, as some vultures are quite raptorial.

==Species==

† = extinct

== Population declines, threats, and implications ==

=== Population declines ===
More than half of the Old World vulture species are listed as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered by the IUCN Red List. Population declines are caused by a variety of threats that vary by species and region, with most notable declines in Asia due to diclofenac use. Within Africa, a combination of poisonings and vulture trade (including use as bushmeat and traditional medicine) account for roughly 90% of the population declines. And because vultures are scavengers, their population decline can have cultural, public health, and economic implications for communities and be even more problematic than the decline of other endangered species. Vulture populations are particularly vulnerable because they typically feed in large groups and easily fall victim to mass poisoning events.

===Threats===
====Diclofenac====
Diclofenac poisoning has caused the vulture population in India and Pakistan to decline by up to 99%, and two or three species of vulture in South Asia are nearing extinction. This has been caused by the practice of medicating working farm animals with diclofenac, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory and pain-killing actions. Diclofenac administration keeps animals that are ill or in pain working on the land for longer, but, if the ill animals die, their carcasses contain diclofenac. Farmers leave the dead animals out in the open, relying on vultures to tidy up. Diclofenac present in carcass flesh is eaten by vultures, which are sensitive to diclofenac, and they suffer kidney failure, visceral gout, and death as a result of diclofenac poisoning. The drug is poisonous enough that only a small amount of animal carcases need to contain it to have detrimental effects on vulture populations.

Meloxicam (another NSAID) has been found to be harmless to vultures and should prove an acceptable alternative to diclofenac. Bans on diclofenac in veterinary practices have been implemented in Pakistan and Nepal and selling or using the drug in India can result in jail time. But while the Government of India banned diclofenac, over a year later, in 2007, it continued to be sold and remains a problem in other parts of the world.

====Poached carcass poisonings====
Poisoning accounts for a majority of vulture deaths in Africa. Ivory poachers poison carcasses with the intent of killing vultures, since vultures circling over a carcass alert authorities to a kill. An increase in demand for ivory has both increased the rate of elephant poachings as well as increased the rate at which vultures are killed off by consuming the poisoned elephant remains. In Kruger National Park, white-backed vultures will be eradicated in the next 60 years if poisoned carcasses are not detected and neutralized. Eliminating carcass poisoning is challenging because it is far easier to carry out than to regulate. Park officials often lack the training to identify toxic chemicals before it is too late and calling on average community members to turn in perpetrators reports is challenging if financial incentives to do so are insufficient.

==== Agricultural poisonings ====
Vultures are also unintentionally poisoned when they consume carcasses of predators that have been poisoned by livestock farmers. For those who rely on livestock to make a living, illegal pesticides are often used on fruits, meats, or even the water in a wateringhole in order to eliminate large predators that threaten their livestock. Agricultural poisoning is relatively easy as it does not require specific skills and the poison is cheap with a long shelf life.

====Traditional medicine/belief and use====
Vultures in Africa are killed for use in traditional medicine as part of the African vulture trade. Vultures can be targeted for the industry directly or collected from other poisoning events, but close to 30% of vulture deaths recorded in Africa can be tied back to belief-based use. In South Africa, vulture consumption events have been estimated to occur 59,000 times a year. Vulture heads are believed to provide clairvoyance or good luck like winning the lottery. The length of time a vulture can be used by healers is dependent on size and species. Some healers have been recorded using Cape vultures for 6 years because they are said to last longer than other species. Others use 1-2 individuals a year but this rate is unsustainable given the estimated number of healers.

===== Muthi =====
In Southern Africa, traditional medicine is called Muthi. For some healers it is believed to cure illnesses, while others believe it cures curses. Vulture muthi involves separate body parts being dried, burned, or ground up. The results may be consumed by mixing with food, drinking, snorting, or applying to cuts. Some healers look for signs of poisoning when purchasing vultures, but others are unaware of how to do this and are at risk of poisoning their clients.

==== Bushmeat consumption ====
Another part of the African vulture trade is use for bushmeat consumption.

==== Electrical infrastructure ====

Collisions with electrical infrastructure account for roughly 9% of vulture deaths in Africa. Some organizations in South Africa are working with power companies to mitigate this threat.

=== Implications ===
As vultures play an important role in ecosystems, their population decline can have cultural, public health, and economic implications for communities.

The decline in vultures has led to hygiene problems in India as carcasses of dead animals now tend to rot, or be eaten by rats or feral dogs, rather than be consumed by vultures. Rabies among these other scavengers is a major health threat. India has one of the world&#x27;s highest incidences of rabies.

For communities such as the Parsi, who practice sky burials in which human corpses are put on the top of a Tower of Silence, vulture population declines can have serious cultural implications.

== Conservation efforts ==
Conservation efforts would be most effective in large, protected areas because vultures are most populous in those. Small but frequent poisoning events have a more detrimental effect on vulture populations than larger, infrequent events because population recovery is more successful when there is a longer time between poisonings. To increase populations, vultures can be reintroduced to poison-free protected areas near other groups of vultures to keep the populations high. This will make it easier for vultures to maintain some individuals after a poisoning event. A project named &quot;Vulture Restaurant&quot; is underway in Nepal in an effort to conserve the dwindling number of vultures. The &quot;restaurant&quot; is an open grassy area where naturally dying, sick, and old cows are fed to the vultures.

Organizations across Africa are working to reduce threats to vulture species with efforts to change and create policies to protect species both at the national and international scale. Proposed strategies to reduce poisoning events include mobile phone numbers to report offenders, campaigns to educate about poisoning risks to humans, and improving response speed to poisoning events. Poison response training would be an important implementation in conservation efforts because this is one of the most prevalent threats to vulture populations.

<doc id="186623" wikidata="Q312011" url="?curid=186623" title="Isaac Singer">
<text>Isaac Merritt Singer (October 27, 1811 – July 23, 1875) was an American inventor, actor, and businessman. He made important improvements in the design of the sewing machine and was the founder of what became one of the first American multi-national businesses, the Singer Sewing Machine Company.

Many others, including Walter Hunt and Elias Howe, had patented sewing machines before Singer, but his success was based on the practicality of his machine, the ease with which it could be adapted to home use and its availability on an installments payment basis.

Singer died in 1875, dividing his $13 million fortune unequally among 20 of his living children by his wives and various mistresses, although one son, who had supported his mother in her divorce case against Singer, received only $500. Altogether, he fathered 26 children by five different women.

==Early life==
Isaac Merritt Singer was born on October 27, 1811, in Pittstown, Schaghticoke, New York. He was the youngest of eight children born to a German father, Adam Singer (né Reisinger) (1772–1855), and his American wife, Ruth (née Benson) Singer. His siblings were John Valentine Singer, Alexander Singer, Elizabeth (née Singer) Colby, Christiana (née Singer) Cleveland, and Elijah Singer. In 1821, his parents divorced and his mother abandoned Isaac. At twelve, he ran away from home to join a traveling stage act, called the Rochester Players, after finding bits of work as a joiner and lathe operator.

==Career==
In 1839, Singer obtained his first patent, for a machine to drill rock, selling it for $2,000 (or over $150,000 in 2024 dollars) to the I &amp; M Canal Building Company. With this financial success, he opted to return to his career as an actor. He went on tour, forming a troupe known as the &quot;Merritt Players&quot;, appearing onstage under the name &quot;Isaac Merritt&quot;, with Mary Ann Sponsler (one of his mistresses) also appearing onstage, calling herself &quot;Mrs. Merritt&quot;. The tour lasted about five years.

He developed and patented a &quot;machine for carving wood and metal&quot; on April 10, 1849.

At 38, with Mary Ann and eight children, he packed up his family and moved back to New York City, hoping to market his wood-block cutting machine. He obtained an advance to build a working prototype, and constructed one in A. B. Taylor &amp; Co shop, where he met G. B. Zieber, who became Singer&#x27;s financier and partner. However, not long after the machine was built, the steam boiler blew up at the shop, destroying the prototype. Zieber persuaded Singer to make a new start in Boston, a center of the printing trade. The singer went to Boston in 1850 to display his invention at the machine shop of Orson C. Phelps. Orders for Singer&#x27;s wood cutting machine were not, however, forthcoming.

Lerow &amp; Blodgett sewing machines were being constructed and repaired in Phelps&#x27; shop. Phelps asked Singer to look at the sewing machines, which were difficult to use and produce. Singer concluded that the sewing machine would be more reliable if the shuttle moved in a straight line rather than a circle, with a straight rather than a curved needle. Singer was able to obtain US Patent number 8294 for his improvements on August 12, 1851.

===I. M. Singer &amp; Co===
In 1856, manufacturers Grover &amp; Baker, Singer, Wheeler &amp; Wilson, all accusing each other of patent infringement, met in Albany, New York to pursue their suits. Orlando B. Potter, a lawyer and president of the Grover and Baker Company, proposed that, rather than squander their profits on litigation, they pool their patents. This was the first patent pool, a process which enables the production of complicated machines without legal battles over patent rights. They agreed to form the Sewing Machine Combination, but for this to be of any use, they had to secure the cooperation of Elias Howe, who still held certain vital uncontested patents. Terms were arranged; Howe received a royalty on every sewing machine manufactured.

Sewing machines began to be mass-produced. I. M. Singer &amp; Co manufactured 2,564 machines in 1856, and 13,000 in 1860 at a new plant on Mott Street in New York. Later, a massive plant was built near Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Up to then, sewing machines had been industrial machines, made for garments, shoes, bridles and for tailors, but in 1856, smaller machines began to be marketed for home use. However, at the then enormous price of over $100 ($4,094.82 in 2024 USD), few sold. Singer invested heavily in mass production utilizing the concept of interchangeable parts developed by Samuel Colt and Eli Whitney for their firearms. He was able to cut the price in half, while at the same time increasing his profit margin by 530%. Singer was the first who put a family machine, &quot;the turtle back&quot;, on the market. Eventually, the price came down to $10(about $404.23 in 2024 USD) According to PBS, &quot;His partner, Edward Cabot Clark, pioneered installment purchasing plans and accepted trade-ins, causing sales to soar.&quot;

Women were able to make items at home for their families or for sale and charitable groups began to support poorer women to find useful skills and respectable employment in sewing, such as the Ladies Work Society (1875), the Association for the Sale of Works of Ladies of Limited Means, the Co-operative Needlewoman&#x27;s Society and associated magazines, pattern books and group classes began for the better off women who also wanted to have some form of useful, economic activity, which a sewing machine at home now offered.

I. M. Singer expanded into the European market, first starting in Bonnybridge, Stirlingshire, next to the iron foundries that supplied the castings for the chassis until expansion was hindered by the expansion of the foundries around them and they then moved to Clydebank, establishing the world&#x27;s largest sewing machine factory, built between 1882 and 1885, by George McKenzie in Kilbowie, Clydebank, near Glasgow, consisting of two main manufacturing buildings on three levels (one building for making the domestic machines, the other for industrial model production), with a 200 ft (over 60meters) high tower with the &#x27;Singer&#x27; name logo and four clock faces which was the largest four-sided clock tower at the time. Singer opened the factory at Clydebank with 3,500 people making 8,000 sewing machines a week on average. The factory was linked directly to railway lines, and via stations in Dumbarton and Helensburgh to assist in distribution. Later improvements included a further two levels for the production blocks and a power station and sawmills. (Note: images of the tower and the factory&#x27;s transport connections are available on the Scottish National Buildings Record) The factory later supplied military and home sewers, and made munitions during World War II. In 1941, the factory and area was severely damaged (losing 390,000 sq ft 36,000 sq m) in the &#x27;Clydebank Blitz&#x27; when at least 35,000 homes were damaged and 500 people, including 39 Singer workers were killed.

Even as early as 1880, Singer machines compared favorably with their nearest competitors: information articles becoming marketing tool. By the 1900s, this factory, controlled by the parent company, made 1.5 million machines sold around the world, helping the Singer company in becoming one of the first American-based multinational corporations, with agencies in Paris and Rio de Janeiro.

Later as the Singer Manufacturing Company and its competitors expanded, due to its affordability (or purchase plan terms) by the 1940s there were 24,000 sewing classes a year running in the UK alone, and the Education Act 1944 made practical dressmaking a compulsory subject for girls in all state schools. By the 1950s, there were Singer Teen-Age Sewing Classes and advertising campaigns to encourage girls to make their own fashions to attract boys&#x27; interest.

===Changes to company in Europe===

In 1863, I. M. Singer &amp; Co. was dissolved by mutual consent with Edward Cabot Clark seeing Singer&#x27;s reputation as a risk to growth; but the business continued with Singer owning 40% of shares and still on the board, as &quot;The Singer Manufacturing Company&quot;, in 1887.

In 1871, Singer purchased an estate and settled with Isabella in Paignton, Devon, England. He commissioned the 110-roomed Oldway Mansion as his private residence, with a hall of mirrors, maze and grotto garden; it was rebuilt by Paris Singer, his third son from Isabella, in the style of the Palace of Versailles. And the area became known locally as &#x27;Singerton&#x27;. It has been named by the Victorian Society as a heritage building at risk of disrepair.

=== Consequence on global garment industry ===
Singer&#x27;s prototype sewing machine became the first to work in a practical way. It could sew 900 stitches per minute, far better than the 40 of an accomplished seamstress on simple work. This started the industrialisation of garment and textile manufacturing, as a shirt took an hour to make compared to fifteen hours previously, but these still needed finishing by hand, and the finishers worked alone on piecework terms at home, but mass over-production by factories&#x27; machines, led to pressure on wages and to unemployment.

In 1911, most of the mainly female workforce at the Clydebank Singer factory went on strike in support of 12 workers who had objected to increased workload and lower pay conditions imposed (by this time there were 11,500 employees). Although the strike did not succeed, Singer fired 400 workers including the union leaders. The Singer Strike was one of the key actions leading to protests known as Red Clydeside.

In the 1960s, Japanese production efficiency brought aluminium body machines and products at lower pricing which outsold the cast iron Singer machines. The symbolic tower was knocked down as the Singer Clydebank factory was modernised, but it closed in 1980 and was demolished in the late 1990s.

==Personal life==
In 1830, at nineteen, Isaac Singer married fifteen-year-old Catherine Maria Haley (1815–1884). The couple had two children before he left her to join the Baltimore Strolling Players. In 1860, Singer divorced Catherine on the basis of her adultery with Stephen Kent. Their son William spoke up for his mother in the divorce case and was snubbed by Singer, including in his will where William received just $500 of Singer&#x27;s $13,000,000 fortune. Their two children were:
* William Adam Singer (1834–1914), who in 1872 married Sarah Augusta Webb (1851–1909), a twin sister of William Seward Webb (who married Eliza Osgood Vanderbilt). 
* Lillian C. Singer (1837–1912), who married Harry Hodson.

In 1836, while still married to Catherine, Singer began a 25-year affair with Mary Ann Sponsler (1817–1896). Together, Mary Ann and Isaac had ten children, two of whom died at birth, including:
* Isaac Augustus Singer (1837–1902), who married Sarah Jane Clarke.
* Vouletti Theresa Singer (1840–1913), who married William Fash Proctor.
* John Albert Singer (1842–1911), who married Jennie C. Belinski.
* Fanny Elizabeth Singer (1844–1909), who married William S. Archer.
* Jasper Hamlet Singer (1846–1922), who married Jane Collier Cook.
* Mary Olivia Singer (1848–1900), who married Sturges Selleck Whitlock, a Connecticut state senator.
* Julia Ann Singer (1855–1923), who married Martin J. Herz.
* Caroline Virginia Singer (1857–1896), who married Augustus C. Foster.

Financial success allowed Singer to buy a mansion on Fifth Avenue, into which he moved his second family. He and Mary Ann had abandoned their joint acting company, the Merritt Players, as his inventions were more successful. He continued to live with Mary Ann, until she spotted him driving down Fifth Avenue seated beside Mary McGonigal, an employee, about whom Mary Ann already had suspicions. Reportedly, Singer also had an affair with McGonigal&#x27;s sister, Kate McGonigal. Together, Mary McGonigal and Isaac were the parents of seven children (who used the surname Matthews), two of whom died at birth, including:
* Ruth Mary Matthews (b. 1852)
* Clara Matthews (1854–1933), who married Col. Hugh Stafford in 1880.
* Margaret Matthews (1858–1939), who married Granville Henry Jackson Alexander, Esq., the High Sheriff of Armagh.
* Charles Alexander Matthews (1859–1883), who married Minnie Mathews.
* Florence Adelaide Matthews (–1932), who married Harry Ruthven Pratt.

And Mary Ann, still calling herself Mrs. I. M. Singer, had her husband arrested for bigamy. Singer was let out on bond and, disgraced, fled to London in 1862, taking Mary McGonigal with him. In the aftermath, another of Isaac&#x27;s families was discovered: he had a &quot;wife&quot;, Mary Eastwood Walters, a machine demonstrator, and had had a daughter in Lower Manhattan:
* Alice Eastwood (née Walters) Merritt (1852–1890), who adopted the surname Merritt and married twice, including to W. A. P. LaGrove at age eighteen in a marriage arranged by Singer.

By 1860, Isaac had fathered and acknowledged twenty children, sixteen of them still then living, by four women. In 1861, his longstanding mistress Mary Ann took him to court for abusing her and daughter Vouletti. With Isaac in London, Mary Ann began setting about securing a financial claim to his assets by filing documents detailing his infidelities, and claiming that, though she had never been formally married to Isaac, they were wed under common law by living together for seven months after Isaac had been divorced from his first wife, Catherine. Eventually, a settlement was made, but no divorce was granted. However, she asserted that she was free to marry, and indeed she married John E. Foster.
Isaac, meanwhile, had renewed acquaintance with Isabella Eugenie Boyer, a nineteen year old Frenchwoman, whom he had lived with in Paris when he was staying there in 1860. She left her husband and married Isaac, who was by now fifty, under the name of Isabella Eugenie Sommerville on June 13, 1863, while she was pregnant. Together, they had six children:
* Sir Adam Mortimer Singer (1863–1929)
* Winnaretta Eugenie Singer (1865–1943), a patron of 20th-century music who married Prince Louis de Scey-Montbéliard in 1887. They divorced in ⁠1892 and she married Prince Edmond de Polignac.
* Washington Merritt Grant Singer (1866–1934), who married Blanche Emmeline Hale and Ellen Mary Allen.
* Paris Eugene Singer (1867–1932), who married Cecilia Henrietta Augusta &quot;Lillie&quot; Graham (1867–1951). Paris was a close friend of the Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner.
* Isabelle-Blanche Singer (1869–1896), who married the French aristocrat Jean, Duc Decazes et de Glücksbierg in 1888.
* Franklin Merritt Morse Singer (1870–1939), who married Emilie Maigret.

Isaac Singer died in 1875, shortly after the wedding of his daughter by Mary Eastwood Walters, Alice, whose dress had cost as much as a London apartment. His funeral was an elaborate affair with eighty horse-drawn carriages, and around 2,000 mourners, to see him buried locally in Torquay Cemetery, at his request in three layers of coffin (cedar lined with satin, lead, English oak with silver decoration) and a marble tomb.

==Legacy and honors==
* The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.
* Singer Island, Florida was named for his son Paris Singer

<doc id="186625" wikidata="Q521616" url="?curid=186625" title="Antimalarial medication">
<text>Antimalarial medications or simply antimalarials are a type of antiparasitic chemical agent, often naturally derived, that can be used to treat or to prevent malaria, in the latter case, most often aiming at two susceptible target groups, young children and pregnant women. As of 2018, modern treatments, including for severe malaria, continued to depend on therapies deriving historically from quinine and artesunate, both parenteral (injectable) drugs, expanding from there into the many classes of available modern drugs. Incidence and distribution of the disease (&quot;malaria burden&quot;) is expected to remain high, globally, for many years to come; moreover, known antimalarial drugs have repeatedly been observed to elicit resistance in the malaria parasite—including for combination therapies featuring artemisinin, a drug of last resort, where resistance has now been observed in Southeast Asia. As such, the needs for new antimalarial agents and new strategies of treatment (e.g., new combination therapies) remain important priorities in tropical medicine. As well, despite very positive outcomes from many modern treatments, serious side effects can impact some individuals taking standard doses (e.g., retinopathy with chloroquine, acute haemolytic anaemia with tafenoquine).

Specifically, antimalarial drugs may be used to treat malaria in three categories of individuals, (i) those with suspected or confirmed infection, (ii) those visiting a malaria-endemic regions who have no immunity, to prevent infection via malaria prophylaxis, and (iii) or in broader groups of individuals, in routine but intermittent preventative treatment in regions where malaria is endemic via intermittent preventive therapy. Practice in treating cases of malaria is most often based on the concept of combination therapy (e.g., using agents such as artemether and lumefantrine against chloroquine-resistant &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; infection), since this offers advantages including reduced risk of treatment failure, reduced risk of developed resistance, as well as the possibility of reduced side-effects. Prompt parasitological confirmation by microscopy, or alternatively by rapid diagnostic tests, is recommended in all patients suspected of malaria before treatment is started. Treatment solely on the basis of clinical suspicion is considered when a parasitological diagnosis is not possible.

Anti-malaria aid campaigns have a globally positive impact for health outcomes and beyond. 

==Medications==
It is practical to consider antimalarials by chemical structure since this is associated with important properties of each drug, such as mechanism of action.

===Quinine and related agents===

Quinine has a long history stretching from Peru, and the discovery of the cinchona tree, and the potential uses of its bark, to the current day and a collection of derivatives that are still frequently used in the prevention and treatment of malaria. Quinine is an alkaloid that acts as a blood schizonticidal and weak gametocide against &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; and &quot;Plasmodium malariae&quot;. As an alkaloid, it is accumulated in the food vacuoles of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species, especially &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. It acts by inhibiting the hemozoin biocrystallization, thus facilitating an aggregation of cytotoxic heme. Quinine is less effective and more toxic as a blood schizonticidal agent than chloroquine; however, it is still very effective and widely used in the treatment of acute cases of severe &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. It is especially useful in areas where there is known to be a high level of resistance to chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfa drug combinations with pyrimethamine. Quinine is also used in post-exposure treatment of individuals returning from an area where malaria is endemic.

The treatment regimen of quinine is complex and is determined largely by the parasite&#x27;s level of resistance and the reason for drug therapy (i.e. acute treatment or prophylaxis). The World Health Organization recommendation for quinine is 20 mg/kg the first dose and 10 mg/kg every eight hours for five days where parasites are sensitive to quinine, combined with doxycycline, tetracycline or clindamycin. Doses can be given by oral, intravenous or intramuscular routes. The suggested course of action is determined by the need for therapy and the available resources (i.e. sterilised needles for IV or IM injections).

Use of quinine is characterised by a frequently experienced syndrome called cinchonism. Tinnitus (a hearing impairment), rashes, vertigo, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain are the most common symptoms. Neurological effects are experienced in some cases due to the drug&#x27;s neurotoxic properties. These actions are mediated through the interactions of quinine causing a decrease in the excitability of the motor neuron end plates. This often results in functional impairment of the eighth cranial nerve, resulting in confusion, delirium and coma. Quinine can cause hypoglycaemia through its action of stimulating insulin secretion; this occurs in therapeutic doses and therefore it is advised that glucose levels are monitored in all patients every 4–6 hours. This effect can be exaggerated in pregnancy and therefore additional care in administering and monitoring the dosage is essential. Repeated or over-dosage can result in kidney failure and death through depression of the respiratory system.

Quinimax and quinidine are the two most commonly used alkaloids related to quinine in the treatment or prevention of malaria. Quinimax is a combination of four alkaloids (quinine, quinidine, cinchonine and cinchonidine). This combination has been shown in several studies to be more effective than quinine, supposedly due to a synergistic action among the four cinchona derivatives. Quinidine is a direct derivative of quinine. It is a distereoisomer, thus having similar anti-malarial properties to the parent compound. Quinidine is recommended only for the treatment of severe cases of malaria.

Warburg&#x27;s tincture was a febrifuge developed by Carl Warburg in 1834, which included quinine as a key ingredient. In the 19th-century it was a well-known anti-malarial drug. Although originally sold as a secret medicine, Warburg&#x27;s tincture was highly regarded by many eminent medical professionals who considered it as being superior to quinine (e.g. Surgeon-General W. C. Maclean, Professor of Military Medicine at British Army Medical School, Netley). Warburg&#x27;s tincture appeared in &quot;&quot; from 1883 until about 1920. The formula was published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; 1875.

===Chloroquine===

Chloroquine was, until recently, the most widely used anti-malarial. It was the original prototype from which most methods of treatment are derived. It is also the least expensive, best tested and safest of all available drugs. The emergence of drug-resistant parasitic strains is rapidly decreasing its effectiveness; however, it is still the first-line drug of choice in most sub-Saharan African countries. It is now suggested that it is used in combination with other antimalarial drugs to extend its effective usage. Popular drugs based on chloroquine phosphate (also called nivaquine) are Chloroquine FNA, Resochin and Dawaquin.

Chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinolone compound with a complicated and still unclear mechanism of action. It is believed to reach high concentrations in the vacuoles of the parasite, which, due to its alkaline nature, raises the internal pH. It controls the conversion of toxic heme to hemozoin by inhibiting the biocrystallization of hemozoin, thus poisoning the parasite through excess levels of toxicity. Other potential mechanisms through which it may act include interfering with the biosynthesis of parasitic nucleic acids and the formation of a chloroquine-haem or chloroquine-DNA complex. The most significant level of activity found is against all forms of the schizonts (with the obvious exception of chloroquine-resistant &quot;P. falciparum&quot; and &quot;P. vivax&quot; strains) and the gametocytes of &quot;P. vivax&quot;, &quot;P. malariae&quot;, &quot;P. ovale&quot; as well as the immature gametocytes of &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. Chloroquine also has a significant anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory effect when used to treat &quot;P. vivax&quot; infections, and thus it may still remain useful even when resistance is more widespread. According to a report on the Science and Development Network website&#x27;s sub-Saharan Africa section, there is very little drug resistance among children infected with malaria on the island of Madagascar, but what drug resistance there is exists against chloroquinine.

Children and adults should receive 25 mg of chloroquine per kg given over three days. A pharmacokinetically superior regime, recommended by the WHO, involves giving an initial dose of 10 mg/kg followed 6–8 hours later by 5 mg/kg, then 5 mg/kg on the following two days. For chemoprophylaxis: 5 mg/kg/week (single dose) or 10 mg/kg/week divided into six daily doses is advised. Chloroquine is only recommended as a prophylactic drug in regions only affected by &quot;P. vivax&quot; and sensitive &quot;P. falciparum&quot; strains. Chloroquine has been used in the treatment of malaria for many years and no abortifacient or teratogenic effects have been reported during this time; therefore, it is considered very safe to use during pregnancy. However, itching can occur at intolerable level and chloroquinine can be a provocation factor of psoriasis.

===Hydroxychloroquine===

Hydroxychloroquine was derived in the 1950s by adding a hydroxy group to existing chloroquine, making it more tolerable than chloroquine by itself.

===Amodiaquine===

Amodiaquine is a 4-aminoquinolone anti-malarial drug similar in structure and mechanism of action to chloroquine. Amodiaquine has tended to be administered in areas of chloroquine resistance while some patients prefer its tendency to cause less itching than chloroquine. Amodiaquine is now available in a combined formulation with artesunate (ASAQ) and is among the artemisinin-combination therapies recommended by the World Health Organization. Combination with sulfadoxine=pyrimethamine is not recommended.

The drug should be given in doses between 25 mg/kg and 35 mg/kg over three days in a similar method to that used in chloroquine administration. Adverse reactions are generally similar in severity and type to that seen in chloroquine treatment. In addition, bradycardia, itching, nausea, vomiting and some abdominal pain have been recorded. Some blood and hepatic disorders have also been seen in a small number of patients.

===Pyrimethamine===

Pyrimethamine is used in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. It is particularly useful in cases of chloroquine-resistant &quot;P. falciparum&quot; strains when combined with sulfadoxine. It acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase in the parasite thus preventing the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines, thereby halting the processes of DNA replication, cell division and reproduction. It acts primarily on the schizonts during the erythrocytic phase, and nowadays is only used in concert with a sulfonamide

===Proguanil===

Proguanil (chloroguanide) is a biguanide; a synthetic derivative of pyrimidine. It was developed in 1945 by a British Antimalarial research group. It has many mechanisms of action but primarily is mediated through conversion to the active metabolite cycloguanil. This inhibits the malarial dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Its most prominent effect is on the primary tissue stages of &quot;P. falciparum, P. vivax&quot; and &quot;P. ovale&quot;. It has no known effect against hypnozoites therefore is not used in the prevention of relapse. It has a weak blood schizonticidal activity and is not recommended for therapy of acute infection. However it is useful in prophylaxis when combined with atovaquone or chloroquine (in areas where there is no chloroquine resistance). 3 mg/kg is the advised dosage per day, (hence approximate adult dosage is 200 mg). The pharmacokinetic profile of the drugs indicates that a half dose, twice daily maintains the plasma levels with a greater level of consistency, thus giving a greater level of protection. The proguanil- chloroquine combination does not provide effective protection against resistant strains of &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. There are very few side effects to proguanil, with slight hair loss and mouth ulcers being occasionally reported following prophylactic use. Proguanil hydrochloride is marketed as Paludrine by AstraZeneca.

===Sulfonamides===

Sulfadoxine and sulfamethoxypyridazine are specific inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway of malaria parasites. They are structural analogs of &quot;p&quot;-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and compete with PABA to block its conversion to dihydrofolic acid. Sulfonamides act on the schizont stages of the erythrocytic (asexual) cycle. When administered alone sulfonamides are not efficacious in treating malaria but co-administration with the antifolate pyrimethamine, most commonly as fixed-dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar), produces synergistic effects sufficient to cure sensitive strains of malaria.

Sulfonamides are not recommended for chemoprophylaxis because of rare but severe skin reactions experienced. However it is used frequently for clinical episodes of the disease.

===Mefloquine===

Mefloquine was developed during the Vietnam War and is chemically related to quinine. It was developed to protect American troops against multi-drug resistant &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. It is a very potent blood schizonticide with a long half-life. It is thought to act by forming toxic heme complexes that damage parasitic food vacuoles. Mefloquine is effective in prophylaxis and for acute therapy. It is now used solely for the prevention of resistant strains of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; (usually combined with artesunate) despite being effective against &quot;P. vivax&quot;, &quot;P. ovale&quot; and &quot;P. marlariae&quot;. Chloroquine/proguanil or sulfa drug-pyrimethamine combinations should be used in all other plasmodia infections.

The major commercial manufacturer of mefloquine-based malaria treatment is Roche Pharmaceuticals, which markets the drug under the trade name Lariam. Lariam is fairly expensive at around three € per tablet (pricing of the year 2000).

A dose of 15–25 mg/kg is recommended, depending on the prevalence of mefloquine resistance. The increased dosage is associated with a much greater level of intolerance, most noticeably in young children; with the drug inducing vomiting and esophagitis. It was not recommended for use during the first trimester, although considered safe during the second and third trimesters; nevertheless, in October 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed its recommendation and approved use of Mefloquine for both prophylaxis and treatment of malaria in all trimesters, after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) changed its categorization from C to B. Mefloquine frequently produces side effects, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and dizziness. Several associations with neurological events have been made, namely affective and anxiety disorders, hallucinations, sleep disturbances, psychosis, toxic encephalopathy, convulsions and delirium. Cardiovascular effects have been recorded with bradycardia and sinus arrhythmia being consistently recorded in 68% of patients treated with mefloquine (in one hospital-based study).

Mefloquine can only be taken for a period up to six months due to side effects. After this, other drugs (such as those based on paludrine/nivaquine) again need to be taken.

===Atovaquone===

Atovaquone is available in combination with proguanil under the name Malarone, albeit at a price higher than Lariam. It is commonly used in prophylaxis by travelers and used to treat falciparum malaria in developed countries. A liquid oral suspension of atovaquone is available under the name Mepron.

===Primaquine===

Primaquine is a highly active 8-aminoquinolone that is effective against &quot;P. falcipraum&quot; gametocytes but also acts on merozoites in the bloodstream and on hypnozoites, the dormant hepatic forms of &quot;P. vivax&quot; and &quot;P. ovale&quot;. It is the only known drug to cure both relapsing malaria infections and acute cases. The mechanism of action is not fully understood but it is thought to block oxidative metabolism in Plasmodia. It can also be combined with methylene blue.

For the prevention of relapse in &quot;P. vivax&quot; and &quot;P. ovale&quot; 0.15 mg/kg should be given for 14 days. As a gametocytocidal drug in &quot;P. falciparum&quot; infections a single dose of 0.75 mg/kg repeated seven days later is sufficient. This treatment method is only used in conjunction with another effective blood schizonticidal drug. There are few significant side effects although it has been shown that primaquine may cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting, cramps, chest weakness, anaemia, some suppression of myeloid activity and abdominal pains. In cases of over-dosage granulocytopenia may occur.

===Artemisinin and derivatives===

Artemisinin is a Chinese herb (qinghaosu) that has been used in the treatment of fevers for over 1,000 years. It is derived from the plant &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;, with the first documentation as a successful therapeutic agent in the treatment of malaria is in 340 AD by Ge Hong in his book &quot;Zhou Hou Bei Ji Fang&quot; (&quot;A Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies&quot;). Ge Hong extracted the artemesinin using a simple macerate, and this method is still in use today. The active compound was first isolated in 1971 and named artemisinin.
* Artemisinin has a very rapid action and the vast majority of acute patients treated show significant improvement within 1–3 days of receiving treatment. It has demonstrated the fastest clearance of all anti-malarials currently used and acts primarily on the trophozoite phase, thus preventing progression of the disease. Semi-synthetic artemisinin derivatives (e.g. artesunate, artemether) are easier to use than the parent compound and are converted rapidly once in the body to the active compound dihydroartemesinin. On the first day of treatment 20 mg/kg is often given, and the dose then reduced to 10 mg/kg per day for the six following days. Few side effects are associated with artemesinin use. However, headaches, nausea, vomiting, abnormal bleeding, dark urine, itching and some drug fever have been reported by a small number of patients. Some cardiac changes were reported during a clinical trial, notably non specific ST changes and a first degree atrioventricular block (these disappeared when the patients recovered from the malarial fever).
* Artemether is a methyl ether derivative of dihydroartemesinin. It is similar to artemesinin in mode of action but demonstrates a reduced ability as a hypnozoiticidal compound, instead acting more significantly to decrease gametocyte carriage. Similar restrictions are in place, as with artemesinin, to prevent the development of resistance, therefore it is only used in combination therapy for severe acute cases of drug-resistant &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. It should be administered in a 7-day course with 4 mg/kg given per day for three days, followed by 1.6 mg/kg for three days. Side effects of the drug are few but include potential neurotoxicity developing if high doses are given.
* Artesunate is a hemisuccinate derivative of the active metabolite dihydroartemisin. Currently it is the most frequently used of all the artemesinin-type drugs. Its only effect is mediated through a reduction in the gametocyte transmission. It is used in combination therapy and is effective in cases of uncomplicated &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. The dosage recommended by the WHO is a five or seven day course (depending on the predicted adherence level) of 4 mg/kg for three days (usually given in combination with mefloquine) followed by 2 mg/kg for the remaining two or four days. In large studies carried out on over 10,000 patients in Thailand no adverse effects have been shown.
* Dihydroartemisinin is the active metabolite to which artemesinin is reduced. It is the most effective artemesinin compound and the least stable. It has a strong blood schizonticidal action and reduces gametocyte transmission. It is used for therapeutic treatment of cases of resistant and uncomplicated &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. 4 mg/kg doses are recommended on the first day of therapy followed by 2 mg/kg for six days. As with artesunate, no side effects to treatment have thus far been recorded.
* Arteether is an ethyl ether derivative of dihydroartemisinin. It is used in combination therapy for cases of uncomplicated resistant &quot;P. falciparum&quot;. The recommended dosage is 150 mg/kg per day for three days given by IM injections. With the exception of a small number of cases demonstrating neurotoxicity following administration no side effects have been recorded.

===Halofantrine===

Halofantrine is a relatively new drug developed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the 1960s. It is a phenanthrene methanol, chemically related to quinine and acts acting as a blood schizonticide effective against all &quot;Plasmodium&quot; parasites. Its mechanism of action is similar to other anti-malarials. Cytotoxic complexes are formed with ferritoporphyrin XI that cause plasmodial membrane damage. Despite being effective against drug resistant parasites, halofantrine is not commonly used in the treatment (prophylactic or therapeutic) of malaria due to its high cost. It has very variable bioavailability and has been shown to have potentially high levels of cardiotoxicity. It is still a useful drug and can be used in patients that are known to be free of heart disease and that have severe and resistant forms of acute malaria. A popular drug based on halofantrine is Halfan. The level of governmental control and the prescription-only basis on which it can be used contributes to the cost, thus halofantrine is not frequently used.

A dose of 8 mg/kg of halofantrine is advised to be given in three doses at six-hour intervals for the duration of the clinical episode. It is not recommended for children under 10 kg despite data supporting the use and demonstrating that it is well tolerated. The most frequently experienced side-effects include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and itch. Severe ventricular dysrhythmias, occasionally causing death are seen when high doses are administered. This is due to prolongation of the QTc interval. Halofantrine is not recommended for use in pregnancy and lactation, in small children, or in patients that have taken mefloquine previously.

===Lumefantrine===
Lumefantrine is a relative of halofantrine that is used in some combination antimalarial regimens.

===Doxycycline===

Probably one of the more prevalent antimalarial drugs prescribed, due to its relative effectiveness and cheapness, doxycycline is a tetracycline compound derived from oxytetracycline. The tetracyclines were one of the earliest groups of antibiotics to be developed and are still used widely in many types of infection. It is a bacteriostatic agent that acts to inhibit the process of protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit thus preventing the 50s and 30s units from bonding. Doxycycline is used primarily for chemoprophylaxis in areas where chloroquine resistance exists. It can also be used in combination with quinine to treat resistant cases of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; but has a very slow action in acute malaria, and should not be used as monotherapy.

When treating acute cases and given in combination with quinine; 100 mg of doxycycline should be given per day for seven days. In prophylactic therapy, 100 mg (adult dose) of doxycycline should be given every day during exposure to malaria.

The most commonly experienced side effects are permanent enamel hypoplasia (although this is only relevant during the period of tooth development during the first decade of life), transient depression of bone growth, gastrointestinal disturbances and some increased levels of photosensitivity. Due to its effect of bone and tooth growth it is not used in children under 8, pregnant or lactating women and those with a known hepatic dysfunction.

Tetracycline is only used in combination for the treatment of acute cases of &quot;P. falciparum&quot; infections. This is due to its slow onset. Unlike doxycycline it is not used in chemoprophylaxis. For tetracycline, 250 mg is the recommended adult dosage (it should not be used in children) for five or seven days depending on the level of adherence and compliance expected. Oesophageal ulceration, gastrointestinal upset and interferences with the process of ossification and depression of bone growth are known to occur. The majority of side effects associated with doxycycline are also experienced.

===Clindamycin===

Clindamycin is a derivative of lincomycin, with a slow action against blood schizonticides. It is only used in combination with quinine in the treatment of acute cases of resistant &quot;P. falciparum&quot; infections and not as a prophylactic. Being more toxic than the other antibiotic alternatives, it is used only in cases where the Tetracyclines are contraindicated (for example in children).

Clindamycin should be given in conjunction with quinine as a 300 mg dose (in adults) four times a day for five days. The only side effects recorded in patients taking clindamycin are nausea, vomiting and abdominal pains and cramps. However these can be alleviated by consuming large quantities of water and food when taking the drug. Pseudomembranous colitis (caused by &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;) has also developed in some patients; this condition may be fatal in a small number of cases.

===Microtubule Inhibitors===
Some microtubule inhibitors, including vinblastine and taxol, are highly potent against malarial parasites, disrupting microtubular structures, at the cost of high mammalian toxicity. Very low cytotoxicity can be found in dinitroaniline or phosphorothioamidate herbicides retaining moderate anti-malarial activity. Trifluralin accumulates in parasite-infected erythrocytes to ~300 times the external concentration, though derivative molecules with better solubility may be wanted to make administration practical.

==Resistance==

Anti-malarial drug resistance has been defined as: &quot;the ability of a parasite to survive and/or multiply despite the administration and absorption of a drug given in doses equal to or higher than those usually recommended but within tolerance of the subject. The drug in question must gain access to the parasite or the infected red blood cell for the duration of the time necessary for its normal action.&quot; Resistance to antimalarial drugs is common. In most instances this refers to parasites that remain following on from an observed treatment; thus, it excludes all cases where anti-malarial prophylaxis has failed. In order for a case to be defined as resistant, the patient in question must have received a known and observed anti-malarial therapy while the blood drug and metabolite concentrations are monitored concurrently; techniques used to demonstrate this include &quot;in vivo&quot;, &quot;in vitro&quot;, and animal model testing, and more recently developed molecular techniques.

Drug resistant parasites are often used to explain malaria treatment failure. However, they are two potentially very different clinical scenarios. The failure to clear parasitemia and recover from an acute clinical episode when a suitable treatment has been given is anti-malarial resistance in its true form. Drug resistance may lead to treatment failure, but treatment failure is not necessarily caused by drug resistance despite assisting with its development. A multitude of factors can be involved in the processes including problems with non-compliance and adherence, poor drug quality, interactions with other pharmaceuticals, poor absorption, misdiagnosis and incorrect doses being given. The majority of these factors also contribute to the development of drug resistance.

The generation of resistance can be complicated and varies between &quot;Plasmodium&quot; species. It is generally accepted to be initiated primarily through a spontaneous mutation that provides some evolutionary benefit, thus giving the anti-malarial used a reduced level of sensitivity. This can be caused by a single point mutation or multiple mutations. In most instances a mutation will be fatal for the parasite or the drug pressure will remove parasites that remain susceptible, however some resistant parasites will survive. Resistance can become firmly established within a parasite population, existing for long periods of time.

The first type of resistance to be acknowledged was to chloroquine in Thailand in 1957. The biological mechanism behind this resistance was subsequently discovered to be related to the development of an efflux mechanism that expels chloroquine from the parasite before the level required to effectively inhibit the process of haem polymerization (that is necessary to prevent buildup of the toxic byproducts formed by haemoglobin digestion). This theory has been supported by evidence showing that resistance can be effectively reversed on the addition of substances which halt the efflux. The resistance of other quinolone anti-malarials such as amodiaquine, mefloquine, halofantrine and quinine are thought to have occurred by similar mechanisms.

&quot;Plasmodium&quot; have developed resistance against antifolate combination drugs, the most commonly used being sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine. Two gene mutations are thought to be responsible, allowing synergistic blockages of two enzymes involved in folate synthesis. Regional variations of specific mutations give differing levels of resistance.

Atovaquone is recommended to be used only in combination with another anti-malarial compound as the selection of resistant parasites occurs very quickly when used in mono-therapy. Resistance is thought to originate from a single-point mutation in the gene coding for cytochrome-b.

===Spread of resistance===

There is no single factor that confers the greatest degree of influence on the spread of drug resistance, but a number of plausible causes associated with an increase have been acknowledged. These include aspects of economics, human behaviour, pharmacokinetics, and the biology of vectors and parasites.

The most influential causes are examined below:
# The biological influences are based on the parasites ability to survive the presence of an anti-malarial thus enabling the persistence of resistance and the potential for further transmission despite treatment. In normal circumstances any parasites that persist after treatment are destroyed by the host&#x27;s immune system, therefore any factors that act to reduce the elimination of parasites could facilitate the development of resistance. This attempts to explain the poorer response associated with immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women and young children.
# There has been evidence to suggest that certain parasite-vector combinations can alternatively enhance or inhibit the transmission of resistant parasites, causing &#x27;pocket-like&#x27; areas of resistance.
# The use of anti-malarials developed from similar basic chemical compounds can increase the rate of resistance development, for example cross-resistance to chloroquine and amodiaquine, two 4-aminoquinolones and mefloquine conferring resistance to quinine and halofantrine. This phenomenon may reduce the usefulness of newly developed therapies prior to large-scale usage.
# The resistance to anti-malarials may be increased by a process found in some species of &quot;Plasmodium&quot;, where a degree of phenotypic plasticity was exhibited, allowing the rapid development of resistance to a new drug, even if the drug has not been previously experienced.
# The pharmacokinetics of the chosen anti-malarial are key; the decision of choosing a long half-life over a drug that is metabolised quickly is complex and still remains unclear. Drugs with shorter half-life&#x27;s require more frequent administration to maintain the correct plasma concentrations, therefore potentially presenting more problems if levels of adherence and compliance are unreliable, but longer-lasting drugs can increase the development of resistance due to prolonged periods of low drug concentration.
# The pharmacokinetics of anti-malarials is important when using combination therapy. Mismatched drug combinations, for example having an &#x27;unprotected&#x27; period where one drug dominates can seriously increase the likelihood of selection for resistant parasites.
# Ecologically there is a linkage between the level of transmission and the development of resistance, however at present this still remains unclear.
# The treatment regime prescribed can have a substantial influence on the development of resistance. This can involve the drug intake, combination and interactions as well as the drug&#x27;s pharmacokinetic and dynamic properties.

===Prevention===

The prevention of anti-malarial drug resistance is of enormous public health importance. It can be assumed that no therapy currently under development or to be developed in the foreseeable future will be totally protective against malaria. In accordance with this, there is the possibility of resistance developing to any given therapy that is developed. This is a serious concern, as the rate at which new drugs are produced by no means matches the rate of the development of resistance. In addition, the most newly developed therapeutics tend to be the most expensive and are required in the largest quantities by some of the poorest areas of the world. Therefore, it is apparent that the degree to which malaria can be controlled depends on the careful use of the existing drugs to limit, insofar as it is possible, any further development of resistance.

Provisions essential to this process include the delivery of fast primary care where staff are well trained and supported with the necessary supplies for efficient treatment. This in itself is inadequate in large areas where malaria is endemic thus presenting an initial problem. One method proposed that aims to avoid the fundamental lack in certain countries&#x27; health care infrastructure is the privatisation of some areas, thus enabling drugs to be purchased on the open market from sources that are not officially related to the health care industry. Although this is now gaining some support there are many problems related to limited access and improper drug use, which could potentially increase the rate of resistance development to an even greater extent.

There are two general approaches to preventing the spread of resistance: preventing malaria infections, and preventing the transmission of resistant parasites.

Preventing malaria infections developing has a substantial effect on the potential rate of development of resistance, by directly reducing the number of cases of malaria thus decreasing the need for anti-malarial therapy. Preventing the transmission of resistant parasites limits the risk of resistant malarial infections becoming endemic and can be controlled by a variety of non-medical methods including insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, environmental controls (such as swamp draining) and personal protective methods such as using mosquito repellent. Chemoprophylaxis is also important in the transmission of malaria infection and resistance in defined populations (for example travelers).

A hope for future of anti-malarial therapy is the development of an effective malaria vaccine. This could have enormous public health benefits, providing a cost-effective and easily applicable approach to preventing not only the onset of malaria but the transmission of gametocytes, thus reducing the risk of resistance developing. Anti-malarial therapy also could be diversified by combining a potentially effective vaccine with current chemotherapy, thereby reducing the chance of vaccine resistance developing.

== Combination therapy ==

The problem of the development of malaria resistance must be weighed against the essential goal of anti-malarial care; that is to reduce morbidity and mortality. Thus a balance must be reached that attempts to achieve both goals while not compromising either too much by doing so. The most successful attempts so far have been in the administration of combination therapy. This can be defined as, &#x27;the simultaneous use of two or more blood schizonticidal drugs with independent modes of action and different biochemical targets in the parasite&#x27;. There is much evidence to support the use of combination therapies, some of which has been discussed previously, however several problems prevent the wide use in the areas where its use is most advisable. These include: problems identifying the most suitable drug for different epidemiological situations, the expense of combined therapy (it is over 10 times more expensive than traditional mono-therapy), how soon the programmes should be introduced and problems linked with policy implementation and issues of compliance.

The combinations of drugs currently prescribed can be divided into two categories: non-artemesinin-based combinations and artemesinin based combinations. It is also important to distinguish &quot;fixed-dose&quot; combination therapies (in which two or more drugs are co-formulated into a single tablet) from combinations achieved by taking two separate antimalarials.

=== Non-artemisinin based combinations ===

Artemisinin-based combination therapies should be used in preference to amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated &quot;P. falciparum&quot; malaria.

=== Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) ===
Artemesinin has a very different mode of action than conventional anti-malarials (see information above), which makes it particularly useful in the treatment of resistant infections. However, to prevent the development of resistance to this drug it is only recommended in combination with another non-artemesinin based therapy. It produces a very rapid reduction in the parasite biomass with an associated reduction in clinical symptoms and is known to cause a reduction in the transmission of gametocytes thus decreasing the potential for the spread of resistant alleles. At present there is no known resistance to Artemesinin (though some resistant strains may be emerging) and very few reported side-effects to drug usage, however this data is limited.

=== Other combinations ===

Several other anti-malarial combinations have been used or are in development. For example, chlorproguanil-dapsone and artesunate appeared efficacious in trials from the late 90s and 2000s, but the problem of haemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is likely to prevent widespread use.

==By type of malaria==
Antimalarial drugs and combinations may also be sorted according to the type of malaria in which they are used.

===&quot;Falciparum&quot; malaria===

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the recommended antimalarial treatments for uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum. The choice of ACT in a country or region will be based on the level of resistance to the constituents in the combination. For pregnant women, the recommended first-line treatment during the first trimester is quinine plus clindamycin to be given for seven days. In second and third trimesters, it is recommended to give ACTs known to be effective in the country/region or artesunate plus clindamycin for seven days, or quinine plus clindamycin to be given for seven days. Lactating women should receive standard antimalarial treatment (including ACTs) except for dapsone, primaquine and tetracyclines. In infants and young children, it is recommended to give ACTs for first-line treatment, with attention to accurate dosing and ensuring the administered dose is retained.

In severe &quot;falciparum&quot; malaria, it is recommended that rapid clinical assessment and confirmation of the diagnosis is made, followed by administration of full doses of parenteral antimalarial treatment without delay with whichever effective antimalarial is first available. For adults, intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) artesunate is recommended. Quinine is an acceptable alternative if parenteral artesunate is not available. Parenteral antimalarials should be administered for a minimum of 24 h in the treatment of severe malaria, irrespective of the patient&#x27;s ability to tolerate oral medication earlier. Thereafter, it is recommended to complete treatment by giving a complete course of any of the following:
* an ACT
* artesunate plus clindamycin or doxycycline;
* quinine plus clindamycin or doxycycline.

===&quot;Vivax&quot; malaria===

Chloroquine remains the treatment of choice for &quot;vivax&quot; malaria, except in Indonesia&#x27;s Irian Jaya (Western New Guinea) region and the geographically contiguous Papua New Guinea, where chloroquine resistance is common (up to 20% resistance).

===Malaria in poultry===

No medications are approved in the United States for treatment of malaria in poultry.

<text>William Avery Rockefeller Jr. (May 31, 1841 – June 24, 1922) was an American businessman and financier. Rockefeller was a co-founder of Standard Oil along with his elder brother John Davison Rockefeller. He was also a part owner of Anaconda Copper, which was the fourth-largest company in the world by the late 1920s. Rockefeller started his business career as a clerk at 16. In 1867, he joined his brother&#x27;s company, Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler, which later became Standard Oil. The company was eventually split up by the Supreme Court in 1911. Rockefeller also had a significant involvement in the copper industry. In 1899, Rockefeller and Standard Oil principal Henry H. Rogers joined with Anaconda Company founder Marcus Daly to create the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company, which later returned to the name Anaconda Copper.

He married Almira Geraldine Goodsell in 1864, and they had six children. Rockefeller died in 1922, leaving a gross estate of $102 million, significantly reduced by debts and taxes. He was a prominent member of the Rockefeller family, contributing to its reputation as a leading American business dynasty.

==Early years==
William Avery Rockefeller Jr. was born in Richford, New York. He was the middle son of con artist William Avery Rockefeller Sr. and Eliza Davison. In addition to elder brother John, William Jr.&#x27;s siblings were Lucy, Mary, and twins Franklin (Frank) and Frances (who died young). He also had two elder half-sisters, Clorinda (who died young) and Cornelia, through his father&#x27;s affairs with mistress and housekeeper Nancy Brown. In 1853 his family moved to Strongsville, Ohio. As a young pupil in public school, he was inspired and motivated by his teacher-mentor, Rufus Osgood Mason, whom Rockefeller later named &quot;A Rockefeller Patron.&quot;

==Business career==
At the age of sixteen, he began work as a clerk for a miller in Cleveland, Ohio. About two years later, he joined his older brother&#x27;s produce commission business, Clark and Rockefeller, which later supplied provisions to the Union Army.

===Oil business===

Rockefeller was very adept in business matters. When John D. formed Rockefeller, Andrews &amp; Flagler in 1867, he invited William to take charge of the company&#x27;s export business in New York. In 1867, William Rockefeller and Co. was formed as a subsidiary to Rockefeller and Andrews. In 1870, that company became Standard Oil. In 1911 Standard Oil of New Jersey was split up by the United States Supreme Court.

===Copper mining===
In 1899, Rockefeller joined fellow Standard Oil principal Henry H. Rogers and Anaconda Copper Company founder Marcus Daly in forming the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company, a holding company that intended to control the copper industry. With Daly as company president and Rogers as Vice-President, Rockefeller and Rogers devised a scheme which earned them a profit of $36 million. First, they purchased Anaconda Properties from Daly for $39 million, with the understanding that the check was to be deposited in the bank and remain there for a definite time (National City Bank was run by Rockefeller&#x27;s friends). Rogers and Rockefeller then set up a paper organization, known as the Amalgamated Copper Mining Company, with their own clerks as dummy directors, saying the company was worth $75 million.

They had Amalgamated Copper Company buy Anaconda from them for $75 million in capital stock, which was conveniently printed for the purpose. Then, they borrowed $39 million from the bank using Amalgamated Copper as collateral. They paid back Daly for Anaconda and sold $75 million worth of stock in Amalgamated Copper to the public. They paid back the bank&#x27;s $39 million and had a profit of $36 million in cash. 

After Daly died in November 1900, banker John Dennis Ryan rose to head Amalgamated&#x27;s Montana operations. Amalgamated acquired two large competitors, and soon controlled all the mines of Butte, Montana. The company returned to the name Anaconda in 1915, and by the late 1920s Anaconda Copper Company was the fourth-largest company in the world.

From 1912 to 1913, the Pujo Committee investigated Rockefeller and others for allegedly earning $30 million in profit through cornering the copper market and &quot;synchronizing with artificially enforced activity&quot; in Amalgamated Copper stock in the New York Stock Exchange.

When the newly formed Mutual Alliance Trust Company opened for business in New York on the Tuesday after June 29, 1902, there were 13 directors, including Emanuel Lehman and Rockefeller.

==Personal life==
Rockefeller married Almira Geraldine Goodsell (March 19, 1844 – January 17, 1920) on May 25, 1864, in Fairfield, Connecticut. There were many connections among this and other elite families. Her sister Esther Judson Goodsell was married to Oliver Burr Jennings, who became one of the original stockholders of Standard Oil. Together, William and Almira had:
#Lewis Edward Rockefeller (March 2, 1865 – August 3, 1866)
#Emma Rockefeller (June 8, 1868 – August 11, 1934), who married Dr. David Hunter McAlpin
#William Goodsell Rockefeller (May 21, 1870 – November 30, 1922), who married Sarah Elizabeth &quot;Elsie&quot; Stillman
#John Davison Rockefeller II (March 8, 1872 – 1877)
#Percy Avery Rockefeller (February 27, 1878 – September 25, 1934), who married Isabel Goodrich Stillman
#Ethel Geraldine Rockefeller (April 3, 1882 – August 13, 1973), who married Marcellus Hartley Dodge Sr.
William Rockefeller Jr. died of pneumonia on June 24, 1922, in Rockwood Hall. He had caught a cold during a car trip he took with brother John and nephew John Jr. to visit his childhood home in Richford, New York. He was interred in the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Sleepy Hollow, New York.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;, in discussing a trust that Rockefeller set up for his born and yet-to-be born great-grandchildren, stated that he &quot;left a gross estate of $102,000,000 which was reduced to $50,000,000 principally by $30,000,000 of debts and $18,600,000 of inheritance and estate taxes.&quot;

Rockefeller was a regular attendee of the Saint Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Scarborough in the last few years of his life.

===Family and descendants===
Rockefeller and Almira&#x27;s second son, William Goodsell Rockefeller, married Sarah Elizabeth &quot;Elsie&quot; Stillman, the elder daughter of James Jewett Stillman and Sarah Elizabeth Stillman; her father was National City Bank president. The new couple&#x27;s family included James Stillman Rockefeller. He became a member of the Jekyll Island Club (aka The millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia, along with J. P. Morgan, Joseph Pulitzer, and other business moguls of the day.

===Residences===

In 1886, Rockefeller bought property in Westchester County along the Hudson River from General Lloyd Aspinwall. He renovated or rebuilt the mansion Rockwood Hall.

The Rockefeller Cottage is a house on Jekyll Island, Georgia. It is also called &quot;Indian Mound&quot; and is next to the Jekyll Island Club. The house was built by Gordon McKay in 1892. McKay died in 1903 and the house was bought by William Rockefeller in 1905, who used it as a winter home. It was evacuated in 1942, along with the rest of the island. The house remained in the Rockefeller family until 1947, when the Jekyll Island Authority bought the property. It was open as a museum from 1950 until 1968, when it was closed for badly needed repairs. It is now a public museum. Decades later the former &quot;Indian Mound&quot; Cottage was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Rockefeller Cottage.

<text>The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE ), also referred to as Explorer 66, was a NASA satellite dedicated to cosmology, which operated from 1989 to 1993. Its goals were to investigate the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB or CMBR) of the universe and provide measurements that would help shape the understanding of the cosmos.

COBE&#x27;s measurements provided two key pieces of evidence that supported the Big Bang theory of the universe: that the CMB has a near-perfect black-body spectrum, and that it has very faint anisotropies. Two of COBE&#x27;s principal investigators, George F. Smoot III and John C. Mather, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006 for their work on the project. According to the Nobel Prize committee, &quot;the COBE project can also be regarded as the starting point for cosmology as a precision science&quot;.

COBE was the second cosmic microwave background satellite, following RELIKT-1, and was followed by two more advanced spacecraft: the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) operated from 2001 to 2010 and the Planck spacecraft from 2009 to 2013.

== Mission ==
The purpose of the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission was to take precise measurements of the diffuse radiation between 1 micrometre and over the whole celestial sphere. The following quantities were measured: (1) the spectrum of the 3 K radiation over the range 100 micrometres to (2) the anisotropy of this radiation from 3 to ; and, (3) the spectrum and angular distribution of diffuse infrared background radiation at wavelengths from 1 to 300 micrometres.

== History ==
In 1974, NASA issued an Announcement of Opportunity for astronomical missions that would use a small- or medium-sized Explorer spacecraft. Out of the 121 proposals received, three dealt with studying the cosmological background radiation. Though these proposals lost out to the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), their strength made NASA further explore the idea. In 1976, NASA formed a committee of members from each of 1974&#x27;s three proposal teams to put together their ideas for such a satellite. A year later, this committee suggested a polar-orbiting satellite called COBE to be launched by either a Delta 5920-8 launch vehicle or the Space Shuttle. It would contain the following instruments:

NASA accepted the proposal provided that the costs be kept under US$30 million, excluding launcher and data analysis. Due to cost overruns in the Explorer program due to IRAS, work on constructing the satellite at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) did not begin until 1981. To save costs, the infrared detectors and liquid helium dewar on COBE would be similar to those used on Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS).

COBE was originally planned to be launched on a Space Shuttle mission STS-82-B in 1988 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, but the Challenger explosion delayed this plan when the Shuttles were grounded. NASA prevented COBE&#x27;s engineers from going to other space companies to launch COBE, and eventually a redesigned COBE was placed into Sun-synchronous orbit on 18 November 1989 aboard a Delta launch vehicle.

On 23 April 1992, COBE scientists announced at the APS April Meeting in Washington, D.C. the finding of the &quot;primordial seeds&quot; (CMBE anisotropy) in data from the DMR instrument; until then the other instruments were &quot;unable to see the template.&quot; The following day &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran the story on the front page, explaining the finding as &quot;the first evidence revealing how an initially smooth cosmos evolved into today&#x27;s panorama of stars, galaxies and gigantic clusters of galaxies.&quot;

The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2006 was jointly awarded to John C. Mather, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and George F. Smoot III, University of California, Berkeley, &quot;for their discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation&quot;.

== Spacecraft ==

COBE was an Explorer class satellite, with technology borrowed heavily from IRAS, but with some unique characteristics.

The need to control and measure all the sources of systematic errors required a rigorous and integrated design. COBE would have to operate for a minimum of 6 months and constrain the amount of radio interference from the ground, COBE and other satellites as well as radiative interference from the Earth, Sun and Moon. The instruments required temperature stability and to maintain gain, and a high level of cleanliness to reduce entry of stray light and thermal emission from particulates.

The need to control systematic error in the measurement of the CMB anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate. The spin axis is also tilted back from the orbital velocity vector as a precaution against possible deposits of residual atmospheric gas on the optics as well against the infrared glow that would result from fast neutral particles hitting its surfaces at extremely high speed.

In order to meet the twin demands of slow rotation and three-axis attitude control, a sophisticated pair of yaw angular momentum wheels were employed with their axis oriented along the spin axis . These wheels were used to carry an angular momentum opposite that of the entire spacecraft in order to create a zero net angular momentum system.

The orbit would prove to be determined based on the specifics of the spacecraft&#x27;s mission. The overriding considerations were the need for full sky coverage, the need to eliminate stray radiation from the instruments and the need to maintain thermal stability of the dewar and the instruments. A circular Sun-synchronous orbit satisfied all these requirements. A altitude orbit with a 99° inclination was chosen as it fit within the capabilities of either a Space Shuttle (with an auxiliary propulsion on COBE) or a Delta launch vehicle. This altitude was a good compromise between Earth&#x27;s radiation and the charged particles in Earth&#x27;s radiation belts at higher altitudes. An ascending node at 18:00 was chosen to allow COBE to follow the boundary between sunlight and darkness on Earth throughout the year.

The orbit combined with the spin axis made it possible to keep the Earth and the Sun continually below the plane of the shield, allowing a full sky scan every six months.

The last two important parts pertaining to the COBE mission were the dewar and Sun-Earth shield. The dewar was a superfluid helium cryostat designed to keep the FIRAS and DIRBE instruments cooled during the duration of the mission. It was based on the same design as one used on IRAS and was able to vent helium along the spin axis near the communication arrays. The conical Sun-Earth shield protected the instruments from direct solar and Earth-based radiation as well as radio interference from Earth and the COBE&#x27;s transmitting antenna. Its multilayer insulating blankets provided thermal isolation for the dewar.

In January 1994, engineering operations concluded and the operation of the spacecraft was transferred to Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) for use as a test satellite.

=== Instruments ===
==== Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR) ====
The Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) investigation uses three differential radiometers to map the sky at 31.4, 53, and 90 GHz. The radiometers are distributed around the outer surface of the cryostat. Each radiometer employs a pair of horn antennas viewing at 30° from the spin axis of the spacecraft, measuring the differential temperature between points in the sky separated by 60°. At each frequency, there are two channels for dual-polarization measurements for improved sensitivity and for reliability. Each radiometer is a microwave receiver whose input is switched rapidly between the two horn antennas, obtaining the difference in brightness of two fields of view 7° in diameter located 60° apart and 30° from the axis of the spacecraft. High sensitivity is achieved by temperature stabilization (at 300 K for 31.4 GHz and at 140 K for 53 and 90 GHz), by spacecraft spin, and by the ability to integrate over the entire year. Sensitivity to large-scale anisotropies is about 3E-5 K. The instrument weighs , uses 114 watts, and has a data rate of 500 bit/s.

==== Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) ====
The Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) consists of a cryogenically cooled (to 2 K) multiband radiometer used to investigate diffuse infrared radiation from 1 to 300 micrometres. The instrument measures the absolute flux in 10 wavelength bands with a 1° field of view pointed 30° off the spin axis. Detectors (photoconductors) and filters for the 8 to 100 micrometre channels are the same as for the IRAS mission. Bolometers are used for the longest wavelength channel (120 to 300 micrometres). The telescope is a well baffled, off-axis, Gregorian flux collector with re-imaging. The instrument weighs approximately , uses 100 W and has a data rate of 1700 bit/s.

==== Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) ====
The Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) is a cryogenically cooled polarizing Michelson interferometer used as a Fourier transform spectrometer. The instrument points along the spin axis and has a 7° field of view. This device measures the spectrum to a precision of 1/1000 of the peak flux at for each 7° field of view on the sky (over the range 0.1 to ). The FIRAS uses a special flared trumpet horn flux collector having very low sidelobe levels and an external calibrator covering the entire beam; precise temperature regulation and calibration are required. The instrument has a differential input to compare the sky with an internal reference at 3 K. This feature provides immunity from systematic errors in the spectrometer and contributes significantly to the ability to detect small deviations from a blackbody spectrum. The instrument weighs , uses 84 watts and has a data rate of 1200 bit/s.

== Scientific findings ==
The science mission was conducted by the three instruments detailed previously: DIRBE, FIRAS and DMR. The instruments overlapped in wavelength coverage, providing consistency check on measurements in the regions of spectral overlap and assistance in discriminating signals from our galaxy, Solar System and CMB.

COBE&#x27;s instruments would fulfill each of their objectives as well as making observations that would have implications outside COBE&#x27;s initial scope.

=== Black-body curve of CMB ===

During the 15-year-long period between the proposal and launch of COBE, there were two significant astronomical developments:
* First, in 1981, two teams of astronomers, one led by David Wilkinson of Princeton University and the other by Francesco Melchiorri of the University of Florence, simultaneously announced that they detected a quadrupole distribution of CMB using balloon-borne instruments. This finding would have been the detection of the black-body distribution of CMB that FIRAS on COBE was to measure. In particular, the Florence group claimed a detection of intermediate angular scale anisotropies at the level 100 microkelvins in agreement with later measurements made by the BOOMERanG experiment. However, a number of other experiments attempted to duplicate their results and were unable to do so.
* Second, in 1987 a Japanese-American team led by Andrew E. Lange and Paul Richards of University of California, Berkeley and Toshio Matsumoto of Nagoya University made an announcement that CMB was not that of a true black body. In a sounding rocket experiment, they detected an excess brightness at 0.5 and wavelengths.

With these developments serving as a backdrop to COBE&#x27;s mission, scientists eagerly awaited results from FIRAS. The results of FIRAS were startling in that they showed a perfect fit of the CMB and the theoretical curve for a black body at a temperature of 2.7 K, in contrast to the Berkeley-Nagoya results.

FIRAS measurements were made by measuring the spectral difference between a 7° patch of the sky against an internal black body. The interferometer in FIRAS covered between 2- and 95-cm−1 in two bands separated at 20-cm−1. There are two scan lengths (short and long) and two scan speeds (fast and slow) for a total of four different scan modes. The data were collected over a ten-month period.

=== Intrinsic anisotropy of CMB ===
The DMR was able to spend four years mapping the detectable anisotropy of cosmic background radiation as it was the only instrument not dependent on the dewar&#x27;s supply of helium to keep it cooled. This operation was able to create full sky maps of the CMB by subtracting out galactic emissions and dipole at various frequencies. The cosmic microwave background fluctuations are extremely faint, only one part in 100,000 compared to the 2.73 K average temperature of the radiation field. The cosmic microwave background radiation is a remnant of the Big Bang and the fluctuations are the imprint of density contrast in the early universe. The density ripples are believed to have produced structure formation as observed in the universe today: clusters of galaxies and vast regions devoid of galaxies.

=== Detecting early galaxies ===
DIRBE also detected 10 new far-IR emitting galaxies in the region not surveyed by IRAS as well as nine other candidates in the weak far-IR that may be spiral galaxies. Galaxies that were detected at the 140 and 240 μm were also able to provide information on very cold dust (VCD). At these wavelengths, the mass and temperature of VCD can be derived. When these data were joined with 60 and 100 μm data taken from IRAS, it was found that the far-infrared luminosity arises from cold (≈17–22 K) dust associated with diffuse H I region cirrus clouds, 15-30% from cold (≈19 K) dust associated with molecular gas, and less than 10% from warm (≈29 K) dust in the extended low-density H II regions.

=== DIRBE ===

On top of the findings DIRBE had on galaxies, it also made two other significant contributions to science. The DIRBE instrument was able to conduct studies on interplanetary dust (IPD) and determine if its origin was from asteroid or cometary particles. The DIRBE data collected at 12, 25, 50 and 100 μm were able to conclude that grains of asteroidal origin populate the IPD bands and the smooth IPD cloud.

The second contribution DIRBE made was a model of the Galactic disk as seen edge-on from our position. According to the model, if the Sun is 8.6 kpc from the Galactic Center, then it is 15.6% above the midplane of the disk, which has a radial and vertical scale lengths of 2.64 and 0.333 kpc, respectively, and is warped in a way consistent with the HI layer. There is also no indication of a thick disk.

To create this model, the IPD had to be subtracted out of the DIRBE data. It was found that this cloud, which as seen from Earth is Zodiacal light, was not centered on the Sun, as previously thought, but on a place in space a few million kilometers away. This is due to the gravitation influence of Saturn and Jupiter.

=== Cosmological implications ===
In addition to the science results detailed in the last section, there are numerous cosmological questions left unanswered by COBE&#x27;s results. A direct measurement of the extragalactic background light (EBL) can also provide important constraints on the integrated cosmological history of star formation, metal and dust production, and the conversion of starlight into infrared emissions by dust.

By looking at the results from DIRBE and FIRAS in the 140 to 5000 μm we can detect that the integrated EBL intensity is ≈16 nW/(m2·sr). This is consistent with the energy released during nucleosynthesis and constitutes about 20–50% of the total energy released in the formation of helium and metals throughout the history of the universe. Attributed only to nuclear sources, this intensity implies that more than 5–15% of the baryonic mass density implied by Big Bang nucleosynthesis analysis has been processed in stars to helium and heavier elements.

There were also significant implications into star formation. COBE observations provide important constraints on the cosmic star formation rate and help us calculate the EBL spectrum for various star formation histories. Observation made by COBE require that star formation rate at redshifts of &quot;z&quot; ≈ 1.5 to be larger than that inferred from UV-optical observations by a factor of 2. This excess stellar energy must be mainly generated by massive stars in yet - undetected dust enshrouded galaxies or extremely dusty star-forming regions in observed galaxies. The exact star formation history cannot unambiguously be resolved by COBE and further observations must be made in the future.

On 30 June 2001, NASA launched a follow-up mission to COBE led by DMR Deputy Principal Investigator Charles L. Bennett. The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe has clarified and expanded upon COBE&#x27;s accomplishments. Following WMAP, the European Space Agency&#x27;s probe, Planck has continued to increase the resolution at which the background has been mapped.

<doc id="186633" wikidata="Q126167" url="?curid=186633" title="Bearded vulture">
<text>The bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), also known as the lammergeier and ossifrage, is a very large bird of prey in the monotypic genus Gypaetus. The bearded vulture is the only known vertebrate whose diet consists of 70–90% bone.

Traditionally considered an Old World vulture, it actually forms a separate minor lineage of Accipitridae together with the Egyptian vulture (&quot;Neophron percnopterus&quot;), its closest living relative. It is not much more closely related to the Old World vultures proper than to, for example, hawks, and differs from the former by its feathered neck. Although dissimilar, the Egyptian and bearded vulture each have a lozenge-shaped tail—unusual among birds of prey. It is vernacularly known as &quot;Homa&quot;, a bird in Iranian mythology.

The bearded vulture population is thought to be in decline; in 2004, it was classified on the IUCN Red List as least concern but has been listed as near threatened since 2014. It lives and breeds on crags in high mountains in Iran, southern Europe, East Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Tibet, and the Caucasus. Females lay one or two eggs in mid-winter that hatch at the beginning of spring.

==Taxonomy==
The bearded vulture was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the vultures and condors in the genus &quot;Vultur&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Vultur barbatus&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;bearded vulture&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1750 by the English naturalist George Edwards. Edwards had based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen that had been collected at Santa Cruz near the town of Oran in Algeria. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Africa, but in 1914 this was restricted to Santa Cruz by the German orthithologist Ernst Hartert. The bearded vulture is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Gypaetus&quot; that was introduced in 1784 by the German naturalist Gottlieb Storr. The genus name &quot;Gypaetus&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;gupaietos&quot;, a corrupt form of &quot;hupaietos&quot; meaning &quot;eagle&quot; or &quot;vulture&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;barbatus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;bearded&quot; (from &quot;barba&quot;, &quot;beard&quot;). The name &quot;lammergeier&quot; originates from the German word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;lamb-vulture&quot;. The name stems from the belief that it attacked lambs.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;G. b. barbatus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) (includes &quot;G. b. hemachalanus&quot; and &quot;G. b. aureus&quot;) – south Europe and northwest Africa to northeast China through the Himalayas to Nepal and west Pakistan
* &quot;G. b. meridionalis&quot; Keyserling &amp; Blasius, JH, 1840 – southwest Arabia and northeast, east, south Africa

==Description==
This bearded vulture is long with a wingspan of . It weighs , with the nominate race averaging and &quot;G. b. meridionalis&quot; of Africa averaging . In Eurasia, vultures found around the Himalayas tend to be slightly larger than those from other mountain ranges. Females are slightly larger than males. It is essentially unmistakable with other vultures or indeed other birds in flight due to its long, narrow wings, with the wing chord measuring , and long, wedge-shaped tail, which measures in length. The tail is longer than the width of the wing. The tarsus is relatively small for the bird&#x27;s size, at . The proportions of the species have been compared to a falcon, scaled to an enormous size.

Unlike most vultures, the bearded vulture does not have a bald head. This species is relatively small-headed, although its neck is powerful and thick. It has a generally elongated, slender shape, sometimes appearing bulkier due to the often hunched back of these birds. The gait on the ground is waddling and the feet are large and powerful. The adult is mostly dark grey, rusty, and whitish in colour. It is grey-blue to grey-black above. The creamy-coloured forehead contrasts against a black band across the eyes and lores and bristles under the chin, which form a black beard that give the species its English name. Bearded vultures are variably orange or rust of plumage on their head, breast, and leg feathers, but this is thought to be cosmetic. This colouration comes from dust-bathing or rubbing iron-rich mud on its body. They also transfer the brown colour to the eggs. The tail feathers and wings are dark grey. The juveniles are dark black-brown over most of the body, with a grey-brown breast, gradually attaining more adult-like plumage over successive years; they take five to seven years to reach full maturity, with the first breeding at eight years or older. The bearded vulture is silent, apart from shrill whistles in their breeding displays and a falcon-like &quot;cheek-acheek&quot; call made around the nest.

===Physiology===
The acid concentration in the bearded vulture&#x27;s stomach has been estimated to be of pH about 1. Large bones are digested in about 24 hours, aided by slow mixing or churning of the stomach content. The high fat content of bone marrow makes the net energy value of bone almost as good as that of muscle, even if bone is less completely digested. A skeleton left on a mountain will dehydrate and become protected from bacterial degradation, and the bearded vulture can return to consume the remainder of a carcass even months after the soft parts have been consumed by other animals, larvae, and bacteria.

==Distribution and habitat==
The bearded vulture is sparsely distributed across a vast range. It occurs in mountainous regions in the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Arabian Peninsula, the Caucasus region, the Zagros Mountains and Alborz Mountains in Iran, the Koh-i-Baba in Bamyan, Afghanistan, the Altai Mountains, the Himalayas, Ladakh in northern India, and western and central China. In Africa, it lives in the Atlas Mountains, the Ethiopian Highlands and south from Sudan to northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, central Kenya, and northern Tanzania. An isolated population inhabits the Drakensberg in South Africa. It has been reintroduced in several places in Spain, such as the Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas Jaén, the Province of Castellón and Asturias. The resident population as of 2018 was estimated at 1,200 to 1,500 individuals.

In Israel it is locally extinct as a breeder since 1981, but young birds have been reported in 2000, 2004, and 2016. The species is extinct in Romania, the last specimens from the Carpathians being shot in 1927. However, unconfirmed sightings of the bearded vulture happened in the 2000s, and in 2016 a specimen from a restoration project in France also flew over the country before returning to the Alps.

In southern Africa, the total population as of 2010 was estimated at 408 adult birds and 224 young birds of all age classes therefore giving an estimate of about 632 birds.

In Ethiopia, it is common at garbage dumps tips on the outskirts of small villages and towns. Although it occasionally descends to , the bearded vulture is rare below altitudes of and normally resides above in some parts of its range. It typically lives around or above the tree line which are often near the tops of the mountains, at up to in Europe, in Africa and in central Asia. In southern Armenia, it breeds below if cliff availability permits. It has even been observed living at elevations of in the Himalayas and been observed flying at a height of .

There are two records of bearded vultures from the Alps reintroduction schemes which have reached the United Kingdom, with the first sighting taking place in 2016 in Wales and the Westcountry. A series of sightings took place in 2020, when an individual bird was sighted separately over the Channel Island of Alderney after migrating north through France, then in the Peak District, Derbyshire, Cambridgeshire, and Lincolnshire. The bird, nicknamed &#x27;Vigo&#x27; by Tim Birch of the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, originated from the reintroduced population in the Alps. As these two birds were both released captive birds, not wild, they have been placed in Category E (&quot;escapes&quot;), and not added to the formal British bird list.
==Behaviour and ecology==
===Diet and feeding===
The bearded vulture is a scavenger, feeding mostly on the remains of dead animals. Its diet comprises mammals (93%), birds (6%) and reptiles (1%), with medium-sized ungulates forming a large part of the diet. It usually disdains the actual meat and typically lives on 85–90% bones including bone marrow. This is the only living bird species that specializes in feeding on bones. Meat and skin only makes up a small part of what the adults eat, but scraps of meat or skin makes up a larger amount of the chicks&#x27; diet. The bearded vulture can swallow whole or bite through brittle bones up to the size of a lamb&#x27;s femur and its powerful digestive system quickly dissolves even large pieces. Their favoured variants of bones to consume consist of fattier and elongated bones like tarsal bones and tibias. They contain more levels of oleic acid which is highly nutritional for them compared to bones that are tinier. Smaller bones will contain less accessible bone marrow therefore being of less value. The bearded vulture has learned to crack bones too large to be swallowed by carrying them in flight to a height of above the ground and then dropping them onto rocks below, which smashes them into smaller pieces and exposes the nutritious marrow. They can fly with bones up to in diameter and weighing over , or nearly equal to their own weight.

After dropping the large bones, the bearded vulture spirals or glides down to inspect them and may repeat the act if the bone is not sufficiently cracked. This learned skill requires extensive practice by immature birds and takes up to seven years to master. Its old name of &quot;ossifrage&quot; (&quot;bone breaker&quot;) relates to this habit. Less frequently, these birds have been observed trying to break bones (usually of a medium size) by hammering them with their bill directly into rocks while perched. During the breeding season they feed mainly on carrion. They prefer the limbs of sheep and other small mammals and they carry the food to the nest, unlike other vultures which feed their young by regurgitation.

Bearded vultures sometimes attack live prey, with perhaps greater regularity than any other vulture. Among these, tortoises seem to be especially favoured depending on their local abundance. Tortoises preyed on may be nearly as heavy as the preying vulture. To kill tortoises, bearded vultures fly with them to some height and drop them to crack open the bulky reptiles&#x27; hard shells. Golden eagles have been observed to kill tortoises in the same way. Other live animals, up to nearly their own size, have been observed to be seized predaceously and dropped in flight. Among these are rock hyraxes, hares, marmots and, in one case, a long monitor lizard. Larger animals have been known to be attacked by bearded vultures, including ibex, &quot;Capra&quot; goats, chamois, and steenbok. These animals have been killed by being surprised by the large birds and battered with wings until they fall off precipitous rocky edges to their deaths; although in some cases these may be accidental killings when both the vulture and the mammal surprise each other. Many large animals killed by bearded vultures are unsteady young, or have appeared sickly or obviously injured. Humans have been anecdotally reported to have been killed in the same way. This is unconfirmed, however, and if it does happen, most biologists who have studied the birds generally agree it would be accidental on the part of the vulture. Occasionally smaller ground-dwelling birds, such as partridges and pigeons, have been reported eaten, possibly either as fresh carrion (which is usually ignored by these birds) or killed with beating wings by the vulture. When foraging for bones or live prey while in flight, bearded vultures fly fairly low over the rocky ground, staying around high. Occasionally, breeding pairs may forage and hunt together. In the Ethiopian Highlands, bearded vultures have adapted to living largely off human refuse.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

The bearded vulture occupies an enormous territory year-round. It may forage over each day. The breeding period is variable, being December through September in Eurasia, November to June in the Indian subcontinent, October to May in Ethiopia, throughout the year in eastern Africa, and May to January in southern Africa. Although generally solitary, the bond between a breeding pair is often considerably close. Biparental monogamous care occurs in the bearded vulture. In a few cases, polyandry has been recorded in the species. The territorial and breeding display between bearded vultures is often spectacular, involving the showing of talons, tumbling, and spiraling while in solo flight. The large birds also regularly lock feet with each other and fall some distance through the sky with each other. In Europe, the breeding pairs of bearded vultures are estimated to be 120. The mean productivity of the bearded vulture is 0.43±0.28 fledgings per breeding pair per year and the breeding success averaged 0.56±0.30 fledgings per pair with clutches/year.

The nest is a massive pile of sticks, that goes from around across and deep when first constructed up to across and deep, with a covering of various animal matter from food, after repeated uses. The female usually lays a clutch of 1 to 2 eggs, though 3 have been recorded on rare occasions, which are incubated for 53 to 60 days. After hatching, the young spend 100 to 130 days in the nest before fledging. The young may be dependent on the parents for up to 2 years, forcing the parents to nest in alternate years on a regular basis. Typically, the bearded vulture nests in caves and on ledges and rock outcrops or caves on steep rock walls, so are very difficult for nest-predating mammals to access. Wild bearded vultures have a mean lifespan of 21.4 years, but have lived for up to at least 45 years in captivity.

==Threats==

The bearded vulture is one of the most endangered European bird species as over the last century its abundance and breeding range have drastically declined. It naturally occurs at low densities, with anywhere from a dozen to 500 pairs now being found in each mountain range in Eurasia where the species breeds. The species is most common in Ethiopia, where an estimated 1,400 to 2,200 are believed to breed. Relatively large, healthy numbers seem to occur in some parts of the Himalayas as well. It was largely wiped out in Europe and, by the beginning of the 20th century, the only substantial population was in the Spanish and French Pyrenees. Since then, it has been successfully reintroduced to the Swiss and Italian Alps, from where they have spread into France. They have also declined somewhat in parts of Asia and Africa, though less severely than in Europe.

Many raptor species were shielded from anthropogenic influences in previously underdeveloped areas therefore they are greatly impacted as the human population rises and infrastructure increases in underdeveloped areas. The increase in human population and infrastructure results in the declines of the bearded vulture populations today. The increase of infrastructure includes the building of houses, roads, and power lines. A major issue with infrastructure and bird species populations is collision with power lines. The declines of the bearded vulture populations have been documented throughout their range resulting from a decrease in habitat space, fatal collisions with energy infrastructure, reduced food availability, poisons left out for carnivores and direct persecution in the form of trophy hunting.

This species is currently listed as near threatened by the IUCN Red List last accessed on 1 October 2016, and the population continues to decline.

==Conservation==
Mitigation plans have been established to reduce the population declines in bearded vulture populations. One of these plans includes the South African Biodiversity Management Plan that has been ratified by the government to stop the population decline in the short term. Actions that have been implemented include the mitigation of existing and proposed energy structures to prevent collision risks, the improved management of supplementary feeding sites as well to reduce the populations from being exposed to human persecution and poisoning accidents and outreach programmes that are aimed at reducing poisoning incidents.

The Foundation for the Conservation of the Bearded Vulture (), established in Spain in 1995, was created in response to the national population dropping to 30 specimens by the end of the 20th century. Focused on conserving the species in the Pyrenees, it also returned the species to other already extinct areas such as the Picos de Europa in the north of the country or the Sierra de Cazorla, in the south. After 25 years of work, the Foundation reported that they had managed to recover the population, with more than 1,000 individuals throughout the country.

===Reintroduction in the Alps===
Efforts to reintroduce the bearded vulture began in the 1970s in the French Alps. Zoologists Paul Geroudet and Gilbert Amigues attempted to release vultures that had been captured in Afghanistan, but this approach proved unsuccessful: it was too difficult to capture the vultures in the first place, and too many died in transport on their way to France. A second attempt was made in 1987, using a technique called &quot;hacking&quot;, in which young individuals (from 90 to 100 days) from zoological parks would be taken from the nest and placed in a protected area in the Alps. As they were still unable to fly at that age, the chicks were hand-fed by humans until the birds learned to fly and were able to reach food without human assistance. This method has proven more successful, with over 200 birds released in the Alps from 1987 to 2015, and a bearded vulture population has reestablished itself in the Alps.

==In culture==

The bearded vulture is considered a threatened species in Iran. Iranian mythology considers the rare bearded vulture (; ) the symbol of luck and happiness. It was believed that if the shadow of a &quot;Homa&quot; fell on one, he would rise to sovereignty and anyone shooting the bird would die in forty days. The habit of eating bones and apparently not killing living animals was noted by Sa&#x27;di in &quot;Gulistan&quot;, written in 1258, and Emperor Jahangir had a bird&#x27;s crop examined in 1625 to find that it was filled with bones.

The Greek playwright Aeschylus was said to have been killed in 456 or 455 BC by a tortoise dropped by an eagle who mistook his bald head for a stone. If this incident did occur, the bearded vulture is a likely candidate for the &quot;eagle&quot; in this story.

The ancient Greeks used ornithomancers to guide their political decisions: bearded vultures, or ossifrage, were one of the few species of birds that could yield valid signs to these soothsayers.

In Tibet, corpses are fed to this vulture. The rite is called a &quot;sky burial&quot; and is accompanied by prayers and mantras for the deceased person. There is a specialist assigned to this task which occurs high in the mountains where the vultures swoop down to eat the bones. The birds are blessed too. They are called &quot;jagod&quot; in the Tibetan language.

In the Bible/Torah, the bearded vulture, as the ossifrage, is among the birds forbidden to be eaten (Leviticus 11:13).

In 1944, Shimon Peres and David Ben-Gurion found a nest of bearded vultures in the Negev desert. The bird is called &quot;&quot; in Hebrew, and Shimon Persky liked it so much he adopted it as his surname.

<text>Jimmy Lee Swaggart (; born March 15, 1935) is an American Pentecostal televangelist.

Jimmy Swaggart Ministries owns and operates the SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN). Swaggart is the senior pastor of the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

==Early life==
Jimmy Lee Swaggart was born on March 15, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana, to fiddle player and Pentecostal preacher Willie Leon (known as &quot;Sun&quot; or &quot;Son&quot;) Swaggart and Minnie Bell Herron, daughter of sharecropper William Herron. Swaggart&#x27;s parents were related by marriage, as Son Swaggart&#x27;s maternal uncle, Elmo Lewis, was married to Minnie Herron&#x27;s sister, Mamie. The extended family had a complex network of interrelationships: &quot;cousins and in-laws and other relatives married each other until the clan was entwined like a big, tight ball of rubber bands&quot;.

Swaggart is the cousin of rockabilly pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis and country music star Mickey Gilley. He also had a sister, Jeanette Ensminger (1942–1999). With his parents, Swaggart attended small Assemblies of God churches in Ferriday and Wisner.

In 1952, aged 17, Swaggart married 15-year-old Frances Anderson, whom he met in church in Wisner, Louisiana while he was playing music with his father, who pastored the Assembly of God Church there. They have a son named Donnie. Swaggart worked several part-time odd jobs to support his young family and also began singing Southern Gospel music at various churches.

According to his autobiography &quot;To Cross a River&quot;, Swaggart, along with his wife and son, lived in poverty during the 1950s as he preached throughout rural Louisiana, struggling to survive on an income of $30 a week (). Being too poor to own a home, the Swaggarts lived in church basements, homes of pastors, and small motels. Sun Records producer Sam Phillips wanted to start a gospel line of music for the label (perhaps to remain in competition with RCA Victor and Columbia, who also had gospel lines at the time) and wanted Swaggart for Sun as the first gospel artist for the label. Swaggart&#x27;s cousin, Jerry Lee Lewis, had previously signed with Sun and was reportedly earning $20,000 per week at the time. Although the offer meant a promise for significant income for him and his family, Swaggart turned Phillips down, stating that he was called to preach the gospel.

==Career==
===Ordination and early career===
Preaching from a flatbed trailer donated to him, Swaggart began full-time evangelistic work in 1955. He began developing a revival-meeting following throughout the American South. In 1960, he began recording gospel music record albums and transmitting on Christian radio stations. In 1961, Swaggart was ordained by the Assemblies of God; a year later he began his radio ministry. In the late 1960s, Swaggart founded what was then a small church named the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the church eventually became district-affiliated with the Assemblies of God.

In 1971, Swaggart began transmitting a weekly 30-minute telecast over various local television stations in Baton Rouge and also purchased a local AM radio station, WLUX (now WPFC). The station broadcast Christian feature stories, preaching and teaching to various fundamentalist and Pentecostal denominations and playing black gospel, Southern gospel, and inspirational music. Swaggart sold many of his radio stations gradually throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

===Shifting to television===
By 1975, the television ministry had expanded to more stations around the United States, and he began to use television as his primary preaching forum. In 1978, the weekly telecast was increased to an hour.

In 1980, Swaggart began a daily weekday telecast featuring Bible study and music, and the weekend, hour-long telecast included a service from either Family Worship Center (Swaggart&#x27;s church) or an on-location crusade in a major city. In the early 1980s, the broadcasts expanded to major cities nationwide. By 1983, more than 250 television stations broadcast the telecast.

===Promotion of RENAMO===
Throughout the 1980s, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries was one of many American Evangelical leaders who promoted the South African-backed Mozambican National Resistance, aka RENAMO, which was accused of committing systematic war crimes during Mozambique&#x27;s 15-year-long civil war. In addition to moral support and publicity, Swaggart Ministries was repeatedly accused of providing funding and material support to the group. In September 1985, government forces supported by Zimbabwe captured RENAMO&#x27;s main headquarters inside Mozambique, Casa Banana. Among the materials left behind by retreating rebels were piles of Swaggart&#x27;s 1982 publication, &quot;How to Receive The Baptism in the Holy Spirit&quot;, translated into Portuguese. During the 1988 trial of Australian missionary Ian Grey, who coordinated much of the private support to RENAMO, it was claimed by the defendant that Swaggart Ministries worked through Shekinah Ministries to provide support to RENAMO. That year, extensive media coverage of Swaggart and his businesses in the wake of a sex scandal largely excluded these allegations. In 1991, Covert Action Magazine and the government of Zimbabwe both accused Swaggart ministries of continuing to fund RENAMO.

===Prostitution scandals===
In 1988, Swaggart was accused of patronizing a prostitute. He was suspended and ultimately defrocked by the Assemblies of God. Three years later, Swaggart was implicated in another scandal involving prostitution. As a result, Swaggart&#x27;s ministry became non-affiliated, nondenominational, and significantly smaller than it was in the ministry&#x27;s pre-scandal years.

Swaggart&#x27;s sex scandals received national media attention.

====1988 prostitution scandal====
Swaggart&#x27;s first prostitution scandal occurred in retaliation for an incident in 1986 when he accused fellow Assemblies of God minister Marvin Gorman of having several affairs. Gorman was defrocked from the Assemblies of God, and his ministry was all but ended. Gorman filed a successful lawsuit against Swaggart for defamation and conspiracy to ruin his reputation; he was awarded damages amounting to $10 million in 1991. Following an appeal, the parties settled the matter for $1.75 million.

As a retaliatory measure, Gorman hired his son Randy and son-in-law Garland Bilbo to watch the Travel Inn on Airline Highway in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans. At the Travel Inn, the two men photographed Swaggart outside Room 7 with Debra Murphree, a local prostitute. Gorman arrived at the Travel Inn a short while later and confronted Swaggart.

According to &quot;Swaggart: The Unauthorized Biography of an American Evangelist&quot;, Gorman secured a promise from Swaggart that he would publicly apologize to Gorman and start the process of Gorman&#x27;s reinstatement to the Assemblies of God. Gorman offered to remain silent if Swaggart would state publicly that he lied about Gorman&#x27;s affairs. Gorman waited almost a year, then hand-delivered a note to Swaggart informing him his time was up; Swaggart did not respond. On February 16, 1988, Gorman contacted James Hamil, one of the 13-man Executive Presbytery of the Assemblies of God, to expose Swaggart&#x27;s assignation with the prostitute. The presbytery leadership of the Assemblies of God suspended Swaggart from broadcasting his television program for three months.

According to the Associated Press, Murphree failed a polygraph test administered by a New York City Police Department polygraph expert. The test administrator concluded that Murphree had failed to tell the truth on all key questions concerning her statement. The test was administered after Murphree offered to sell the story to the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; for $100,000. Murphree failed questions about whether she was paid or promised money to &quot;set up&quot; Swaggart, and whether she made up the story to make money from it. In place of Murphree&#x27;s interview, &quot;Enquirer&quot; editor Levy published an accounting of Swaggart&#x27;s family where they allegedly expressed their fears over Swaggart&#x27;s health. Murphree, who blamed her failed polygraph on &quot;cocaine use&quot; the day before the test was given, went on to have her interview published by &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine.
On February 21, 1988, without giving any details regarding his transgressions, Swaggart delivered what came to be known as his &quot;I have sinned&quot; speech on live television. He spoke tearfully to his family, congregation, TV audience, and ended his speech with a prayer: &quot;I have sinned against You, my Lord, and I would ask that Your Precious Blood ... would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of God&#x27;s forgetfulness never to be remembered against me anymore.&quot;

The national presbytery of the Assemblies of God extended Swaggart&#x27;s suspension to their standard two-year suspension for sexual immorality. His return to the pulpit coincided with the end of the three-month suspension originally ordered by the denomination. Believing that Swaggart was not genuinely repentant in submitting to their authority, the hierarchy of the Assemblies of God defrocked him, removing his credentials and ministerial license.

Swaggart then became an independent and non-denominational Pentecostal minister, establishing Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, based at the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and the SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN) which can be seen in the United States and other countries.

====1991 prostitution scandal====
On October 11, 1991, Swaggart was found in the company of a prostitute for a second time. He was pulled over by a police officer in Indio, California, for driving on the wrong side of the road. With him in the vehicle was a woman named Rosemary Garcia. According to Garcia, Swaggart had stopped to propose sex to her on the side of the road. She later told reporters: &quot;He asked me for sex. I mean, that&#x27;s why he stopped me. That&#x27;s what I do. I&#x27;m a prostitute.&quot; This time, rather than confessing his sins to his congregation, Swaggart told those at Family Worship Center, &quot;The Lord told me it&#x27;s flat none of your business.&quot; Swaggart then temporarily stepped down as head of his ministry for &quot;a time of healing and counseling&quot;.

===Later career===
, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries mainly comprised Family Worship Center, &quot;The Jimmy Swaggart Telecast&quot;, radio and television programs called &quot;A Study in the Word&quot;, &quot;SonLife Radio Network&quot;, a website, and a 24/7 cable and satellite television network, SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN).

Swaggart&#x27;s wife Frances hosts a television program, &quot;Frances and Friends&quot;, shown daily on SBN. Swaggart also hosts a daily Bible study program on SBN, &quot;The Message of the Cross&quot;. His son, Donnie Swaggart, preaches at Family Worship Center and also preaches in churches across America and abroad. Donnie&#x27;s son, Gabriel Swaggart, has served as the ministry&#x27;s youth pastor who leads &quot;Crossfire,&quot; Family Worship Center&#x27;s youth ministry. SBN also delivers live broadcasts of all of its weekly services at Family Worship Center, as well as live broadcasts of all of its camp meetings.
As of 2024, Swaggart remains senior pastor of Family Worship Center.

==Ministries==
===Radio===
Swaggart started SonLife Radio on the noncommercial FM band. Unlike his previous stations, SonLife was commercial-free and it did not sell time to outside ministries; the preaching and teaching were all produced in-house. The music which it played was primarily Southern Gospel. SonLife Radio is also streamed on the Internet.

====List of radio stations====
The network&#x27;s flagship station is WJFM in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Notes:
===Translators===
===Television===
In 1973, Swaggart proposed to television producers in Nashville, Tennessee a television program including a fairly large music segment, a short sermon, and time for talking about current ministry projects. They accepted, and within weeks the &quot;Jimmy Swaggart Telecast&quot; was being broadcast around the United States.

In 1981, Swaggart launched a daily television program titled &quot;A Study in the Word&quot;. From the beginning, the primary cable channels which the program was aired on were CBN Cable (now Freeform), TBN, and the old PTL Network (now the Inspiration Network).

In 1988, Swaggart lost some of his broadcast and merchandise rights following his first prostitution scandal.

In 1991, Swaggart&#x27;s career as a standard televangelist came to an end after more local TV stations cancelled their contracts with him following his second prostitution scandal.

===Jimmy Swaggart Bible College===
In autumn 1984, Swaggart opened Jimmy Swaggart Bible College (JSBC). The college originally provided education and communication degrees.

JSBC enrollment dropped drastically in 1988 when students left as a result of Swaggart&#x27;s scandal, followed by accreditation issues.

In 1991, JSBC was renamed the World Evangelism Bible College and enrollment dropped to 370 students. The college shut down programs in music, physical education, secretarial science, and communications that October and disbanded its basketball team. In November &quot;the college laid off three Bible professors and an English professor, effective at the end of the fall semester&quot;.

===Print===
Swaggart has written about 50 Christian books offered through his ministry. He is the author of the &quot;Expositor&#x27;s Study Bible&quot;, 13 study guides and 38 commentaries on the Bible. The ministry also publishes a monthly magazine, &quot;The Evangelist&quot;.

Swaggart published &quot;Religious Rock n Roll: A Wolf in Sheep&#x27;s Clothing&quot;, in 1985.

===Music===
In 1981, Swaggart received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Gospel Performance, Traditional for his album &quot;Worship&quot;.

==Family==
Since October 10, 1952, Swaggart has been married to Frances Swaggart ( Anderson, born August 9, 1937). They have one son, Donnie (born October 18, 1954), named after Jimmy Swaggart&#x27;s brother who died in infancy. He has three grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

Donnie Swaggart and his son, Gabriel Swaggart, are also preachers, making four generations of the Swaggart family to have become involved in ministerial work.

==In popular culture==
The liner notes to the album D&amp;K (1987) by Christian rock band DeGarmo &amp; Key, included the words &quot;dedicated to Jimmy Swaggart&quot; blacked out but still visible on close inspection, for the song &quot;Brother Against Brother&quot; 

Swaggart&#x27;s prostitution scandals inspired the Ozzy Osbourne song &quot;Miracle Man&quot; on Osbourne&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; (1988).

During his 1988 concerts, Bruce Hornsby would begin his song &quot;Defenders of the Flag&quot; from &quot;Scenes from the Southside&quot; with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Swaggart.

The song &quot;Hexonxonx&quot; on Skinny Puppy&#x27;s 1989 album &quot;Rabies&quot; features a repeating audio sample of Swaggart saying &quot;I am clean...&quot; from his forgiveness speech.

Similarities were noted between heel World Wrestling Federation character Brother Love and Swaggart.

&quot;Jesus He Knows Me&quot;, a 1991 song by Genesis, is a satire on televangelists such as Swaggart, Robert Tilton, and Jim Bakker.

Canadian rock band the New Pornographers took their name from a 1986 speech by Swaggart in which he lambasted rock music as &quot;the new pornography.&quot;

American avant-garde musician Kristin Hayter (as Lingua Ignota) released the EP &quot;Epistolary Grieving for Jimmy Swaggart&quot; on the 5th of November in 2021.

<doc id="186641" wikidata="Q1760607" url="?curid=186641" title="Loa loa filariasis">
<text>&quot;Loa loa&quot; filariasis, (Loiasis) is a skin and eye disease caused by the nematode worm &quot;Loa loa&quot;. Humans contract this disease through the bite of a deer fly (&quot;Chrysops&quot; spp.) or mango fly, the vectors for &quot;Loa loa&quot;. The adult &quot;Loa loa&quot; filarial worm can reach from three to seven centimetres long and migrates throughout the subcutaneous tissues of humans, occasionally crossing into subconjunctival tissues of the eye where it can be easily observed. &quot;Loa loa&quot; does not normally affect vision but can be painful when moving about the eyeball or across the bridge of the nose. Loiasis can cause red itchy swellings below the skin called &quot;Calabar swellings&quot;. The disease is treated with the drug diethylcarbamazine (DEC), and when appropriate, surgical methods may be employed to remove adult worms from the conjunctiva. Loiasis belongs to the group of neglected tropical diseases, and there is a call for it to be included in the high-priority listing.

==Signs and symptoms==

A filariasis such as loiasis most often consists of asymptomatic microfilaremia. Some patients can develop lymphatic dysfunction causing lymphedema. Episodic angioedema (Calabar swellings) in the arms and legs, caused by immune reactions, are common. Calabar swellings are in surface area, sometimes erythematous, and not pitting. When chronic, they can form cyst-like enlargements of the connective tissue around the sheaths of muscle tendons, becoming very painful when moved. The swellings may last for one to three days and may be accompanied by localized urticaria (skin eruptions) and pruritus (itching). They reappear at referent locations at irregular time intervals. Subconjunctival migration of an adult worm to the eyes can also occur frequently, and this is the reason &quot;Loa loa&quot; is also called the &quot;African eye worm&quot;. The passage over the eyeball can be sensed, but it usually takes less than 15 minutes. Eyeworms affect men and women equally, but advanced age is a risk factor. Eosinophilia is often prominent in filarial infections. Dead worms may cause chronic abscesses, which may lead to the formation of granulomatous reactions and fibrosis.

In the human host, &quot;Loa loa&quot; larvae migrate to the subcutaneous tissue, where they mature into adult worms in approximately one year, but sometimes up to four years. Adult worms migrate in the subcutaneous tissues at a speed of less than 1 cm/min, mating and producing more microfilariae. The adult worms can live up to 17 years in the human host.

==Cause==

===Transmission===
&quot;Loa loa&quot; infective larvae (L3) are transmitted to humans by the deer fly vectors of the tabanid genus &quot;Chrysops&quot;—&quot;C. dimidiata&quot; and &quot;C. silacea&quot;. These carriers are blood-sucking and day-biting, and they are found in rainforest-like environments in western and central Africa. Infective larvae (L3) mature to adults (L5) in the subcutaneous tissues of the human host, after which the adult worms—assuming the presence of a male and female worm—mate and produce microfilariae. The cycle of infection continues when a non-infected mango or deer fly takes a blood meal from a microfilaremic human host, and this stage of the transmission is possible because of the combination of the diurnal periodicity of microfilariae and the day-biting tendencies of the &quot;Chrysops&quot; spp.

===Reservoir===
Humans are the primary reservoir for &quot;Loa loa&quot;. Other minor potential reservoirs have been indicated in various fly-biting habit studies, such as hippopotamuses, wild ruminants (e.g. buffalo), rodents, and lizards. A simian type of loiasis exists in monkeys and apes which is transmitted by the deer fly vector &quot;Chrysops langi&quot;. There is no crossover between the human and simian types of the disease.

===Vector===
&quot;Loa loa&quot; is transmitted by several species of tabanid flies. Although horseflies of the genus &quot;Tabanus&quot; are often mentioned as vectors, the two most prominent vectors are from the tabanid genus &quot;Chrysops&quot;—&quot;C. dimidiata&quot; and &quot;C. silacea&quot;. These species exist only in Africa and are popularly known as deer flies or mango flies.

&quot;Chrysops&quot; spp. are small ( long) with a large head and downward-pointing mouthparts. Their wings are clear or speckled brown. They are hematophagous and typically live in forested and muddy habitats like swamps, streams, reservoirs, and rotting vegetation. Female mango and deer flies require a blood meal for the production of a second batch of eggs. This batch is deposited near water, where the eggs hatch in 5–7 days. The larvae mature in water or soil, where they feed on organic material such as decaying animal and vegetable products. Fly larvae are long and take 1–3 years to mature from egg to adult. When fully mature, &quot;C. dimidiata&quot; and &quot;C. silacea&quot; assume the day-biting tendencies of all tabanids.

The bite of the mango fly can be very painful, possibly because of the laceration style employed; rather than puncturing the skin as a mosquito does, the mango fly (and deer fly) makes a laceration in the skin and subsequently laps up the blood. Female flies require a fair amount of blood for their aforementioned reproductive purposes and thus may take multiple blood meals from the same host if disturbed during the first one.

Although &quot;Chrysops dimidiata&quot; and &quot;C. silacea&quot; are attracted to canopied rainforests, they do not do their bite there. Instead, they leave the forest and take most blood meals in open areas. The flies are attracted to smoke from wood fires and they use visual cues and sensation of carbon dioxide plumes to find their preferred host, humans.

A study of &quot;Chrysops&quot; spp. biting habits showed that &quot;C. dimidiata&quot; and &quot;C. silacea&quot; take human blood meals approximately 90% of the time, with hippopotamus, wild ruminant, rodent, and lizard blood meals making up the other 10%.

===Morphology===
Adult &quot;Loa&quot; worms are sexually dimorphic, with males considerably smaller than females at 30–34 mm long and 0.35–0.42 mm wide compared to 40–70 mm long and 0.5 mm wide. Adults live in the subcutaneous tissues of humans, where they mate and produce wormlike eggs called microfilariae. These microfilariae are 250–300 μm long, 6–8 μm wide, and can be distinguished morphologically from other filariae, as they are sheathed and contain body nuclei that extend to the tip of the tail.

===Lifecycle===

During a blood meal, an infected &quot;Chrysops&quot; fly introduces third-stage filarial larvae onto the skin of the human host, where they penetrate the bite wound. The larvae develop into adults that commonly reside in subcutaneous tissue. The female worms measure 40 to 70 mm in length and 0.5 mm in diameter, while the males measure 30 to 34 mm in length and 0.35 to 0.43 mm in diameter. Adults produce microfilariae measuring 250 to 300 μm by 6 to 8 μm, which are sheathed and have diurnal periodicity. Microfilariae have been recovered from spinal fluids, urine and sputum. During the day, they are found in peripheral blood, but during the noncirculation phase, they are found in the lungs. The fly ingests microfilariae during a blood meal. After ingestion, the microfilariae lose their sheaths and migrate from the fly&#x27;s midgut through the hemocoel to the thoracic muscles of the arthropod. There the microfilariae develop into first-stage larvae and subsequently into third-stage infective larvae. The third-stage infective larvae migrate to the fly&#x27;s proboscis and can infect another human when the fly takes a blood meal.

==Diagnosis==
Microscopic examination of microfilariae is a practical diagnostic procedure to find &quot;Loa loa&quot;. It is important to time the blood collection with the known periodicity of the microfilariae (between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.). The blood sample can be a thick smear, stained with Giemsa or haematoxylin and eosin. For increased sensitivity, concentration techniques can be used. These include centrifugation of the blood sample lyzed in 2% formalin (Knott&#x27;s technique), or filtration through a nucleopore membrane.

Antigen detection using an immunoassay for circulating filarial antigens constitutes a useful diagnostic approach because microfilaremia can be low and variable. Though the Institute for Tropical Medicine reports that no serologic diagnostics are available, tests that are highly specific to &quot;Loa loa&quot; have been developed in recent years. This is even though many recently developed methods of antibody detection are of limited value because substantial antigenic cross-reactivity exists between filaria and other parasitic worms (helminths), and a positive serologic test does not necessarily distinguish among infections. The new tests have not reached the point-of-care level yet, but show promise for highlighting high-risk areas and individuals with co-endemic loiasis and onchocerciasis. Specifically, Thomas Nutman and colleagues at the National Institutes of Health have described the a luciferase immunoprecipitation assay (LIPS) and the related QLIPS (quick version). Whereas a previously described LISXP-1 ELISA test had poor sensitivity (55%), the QLIPS test is practical, as it requires only a 15-minute incubation, while delivering high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (100%). No report on the distribution status of LIPS or QLIPS testing is available, but these tests would help to limit complications derived from mass ivermectin treatment for onchocerciasis or dangerous strong doses of diethylcarbamazine for loiasis alone (as pertains to individual with high &quot;Loa loa&quot; microfilarial loads).

Calabar swellings are the primary tool for visual diagnosis. Identification of adult worms is possible from tissue samples collected during subcutaneous biopsies. Adult worms migrating across the eye are another potential diagnostic, but the short timeframe for the worm&#x27;s passage through the conjunctiva makes this observation less common.

In the past, healthcare providers used a provocative injection of &quot;Dirofilaria immitis&quot; as a skin-test antigen for filariasis diagnosis. If the patient was infected, the extract would cause an artificial allergic reaction and associated Calabar swelling similar to that caused, in theory, by metabolic products of the worm or dead worms.

Blood tests to reveal microfilaremia are useful in many, but not all cases, as one-third of loiasis patients are amicrofilaremic. By contrast, eosinophilia is almost guaranteed in cases of loiasis, and blood testing for eosinophil fraction may be useful.

==Prevention==
Diethylcarbamazine has been shown as an effective prophylaxis for &quot;Loa loa&quot; infection.
A study of Peace Corps volunteers in the highly &quot;Loa&quot;—endemic Gabon, for example, had the following results: 6 of 20 individuals in a placebo group contracted the disease, compared to 0 of 16 in the DEC-treated group. Seropositivity for antifilarial IgG antibody was also much higher in the placebo group. The recommended prophylactic dose is 300 mg DEC given orally once weekly. The only associated symptom in the Peace Corps study was nausea.

Researchers believe that geo-mapping of appropriate habitat and human settlement patterns may, with the use of predictor variables such as forest, land cover, rainfall, temperature, and soil type, allow for estimation of Loa loa transmission in the absence of point-of-care diagnostic tests. In addition to geo-mapping and chemoprophylaxis, the same preventative strategies used for malaria should be undertaken to avoid contraction of loiasis. Specifically, DEET-containing insect repellent, permethrin-soaked clothing, and thick, long-sleeved, and long-legged clothing ought to be worn to decrease susceptibility to the bite of the mango or deer fly vector. Mosquito nets do not help increase protection against vectors for loiasis as the vectors are day-biting species.

Vector elimination strategies have been researched. It has been shown that the &quot;Chrysops&quot; vector has a limited flying range, but vector elimination efforts are not common, likely because the insects bite outdoors and have a diverse, if not long, range, living in the forest and biting in the open. No vaccine has been developed for loiasis and there is little report on this possibility.

==Treatment==
Treatment of loiasis involves chemotherapy or, in some cases, surgical removal of adult worms followed by systemic treatment. The current drug of choice for therapy is diethylcarbamazine (DEC), with the recommended dosage of DEC for adults and pediatrics being 8–10 mg/kg/d taken three times daily for 21 days per the CDC. DEC is effective against microfilariae and somewhat effective against macrofilariae (adult worms). Ivermectin use is another recommended drug, which can substantially reduce the microfilarial load but is not effective against macrofilariae. The recommended dosage of ivermectin is 150 μg/kg in patients with a low microfilaria load (with densities less than 8000 mf/mL).

In patients with high microfilaria load and/or the possibility of an onchocerciasis coinfection, treatment with DEC and/or ivermectin may be contraindicated or require a substantially lower initial dose, as the rapid microfilaricidal actions of the drugs can provoke encephalopathy. In these cases, initial albendazole administration has proved helpful and more effective than ivermectin, which can also be risky despite its slower-acting microfilaricidal effects over DEC. The CDC recommended dosage for albendazole is 200 mg taken twice a day for 21 days. Also, in cases where two or more DEC treatments have failed to provide a cure, subsequent albendazole treatment can be administered.

Management of &quot;Loa loa&quot; infection in some instances can involve surgery, though the timeframe during which surgical removal of the worm must be carried out is very short. A detailed surgical strategy to remove an adult worm is as follows. The 2007 procedure to remove an adult worm from a male Gabonian immigrant employed proparacaine and povidone-iodine drops, a wire eyelid speculum, and 0.5 ml 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000, injected superiorly. A 2-mm incision was made and the immobile worm was removed with forceps. Gatifloxacin drops and an eye-patch over ointment were utilized post surgery and there were no complications.

==Epidemiology==
As of 2009, loiasis is endemic to 11 countries, all in western or central Africa, and an estimated 12–13 million people have the disease. The highest incidence is seen in Cameroon, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. The rates of &quot;Loa loa&quot; infection are lower but it is still present in Angola, Benin, Chad, and Uganda. The disease was once endemic to the western African countries of Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast and Mali but has since disappeared.

Throughout &quot;Loa loa&quot;-endemic regions, infection rates vary from 9 to 70 percent of the population. Areas at high risk of severe adverse reactions to mass treatment with ivermectin are at present determined by the prevalence in a population of &gt;20% microfilaremia, which has been recently shown in eastern Cameroon, among other locales in the region.

Endemicity is closely linked to the habitats of the two known human loiasis vectors, &quot;Chrysops dimidiata&quot; and &quot;C. silacea&quot;.

Cases have been reported on occasion in the United States but are restricted to travelers who have returned from endemic regions.

In the 1990s, the only method of determining &quot;Loa loa&quot; intensity was with microscopic examination of standardized blood smears, which is not practical in endemic regions. Because mass diagnostic methods were not available, complications started to surface once mass ivermectin treatment programs started being carried out for onchocerciasis, another filariasis. Ivermectin, a microfilaricidal drug, may be contraindicated in patients who are co-infected with loiasis and have associated high microfilarial loads. The theory is that the killing of massive numbers of microfilaria, some of which may be near the ocular and brain region, can lead to encephalopathy. Cases of this have been documented so frequently over the last decade that a term has been given for this set of complications: neurologic serious adverse events (SAEs).

Advanced diagnostic methods have been developed since the appearance of the SAEs, but more specific diagnostic tests that have been or are currently being developed must be supported and distributed if adequate loiasis surveillance is to be achieved.

There is much overlap between the endemicity of the two distinct filariases, which complicates mass treatment programs for onchocerciasis and necessitates the development of greater diagnostics for loiasis.

In Central and West Africa, initiatives to control onchocerciasis involve mass treatment with ivermectin. However, these regions typically have high rates of co-infection with both &quot;L. loa&quot; and &quot;O. volvulus&quot;, and mass treatment with ivermectin can have SAE. These include hemorrhage of the conjunctiva and retina, hematuria, and other encephalopathies that are all attributed to the initial &quot;L. loa&quot; microfilarial load in the patient before treatment. Studies have sought to delineate the sequence of events following ivermectin treatment that lead to neurologic SAE and sometimes death, while also trying to understand the mechanisms of adverse reactions to develop more appropriate treatments.

In a study looking at mass ivermectin treatment in Cameroon, one of the greatest endemic regions for both onchocerciasis and loiasis, a sequence of events in the clinical manifestation of adverse effects was outlined.

It was noted that the patients used in this study had a &quot;L. loa&quot; microfilarial load of greater than 3,000 per ml of blood.

Within 12–24 hours post-ivermectin treatment (D1), individuals complained of fatigue, anorexia, headache, joint, and lumbar pain—a bent forward walk was characteristic during this initial stage accompanied by fever. Stomach pain and diarrhea were also reported in several individuals.

By day 2 (D2), many patients experienced confusion, agitation, dysarthria, mutism and incontinence. Some cases of coma were reported as early as D2. The severity of adverse effects increased with higher microfilarial loads. Hemorrhaging of the eye, particularly the retinal and conjunctiva regions, is another common sign associated with SAE of ivermectin treatment in patients with &quot;L. loa&quot; infections and is observed between D2 and D5 post-treatment. This can be visible for up to 5 weeks following treatment and has increased severity with higher microfilarial loads.

Haematuria and proteinuria have also been observed following ivermectin treatment, but this is common when using ivermectin to treat onchocerciasis. The effect is exacerbated when there are high &quot;L. loa&quot; microfilarial loads, however, microfilariae can be observed in the urine occasionally. Generally, patients recovered from SAE within 6–7 months post-ivermectin treatment; however, when their complications were unmanaged and patients were left bedridden, death resulted due to gastrointestinal bleeding, septic shock, and large abscesses.

Hypotheses for SAE have been proposed. Though microfilarial load is a major risk factor for post-ivermectin SAE, three main hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanisms. The first hypothesis suggests that ivermectin causes immobility in microfilariae, which then obstructs microcirculation in cerebral regions. This is supported by the retinal hemorrhaging seen in some patients, and is possibly responsible for the neurologic SAE reported. The second hypothesis suggests that microfilariae may try to escape drug treatment by migrating to brain capillaries and further into brain tissue; this is supported by pathology reports demonstrating a microfilarial presence in brain tissue post-ivermectin treatment. The third hypothesis attributes hypersensitivity and inflammation at the cerebral level to post-ivermectin treatment complications, and perhaps the release of bacteria from &quot;L. loa&quot; after treatment to SAE. This has been observed with the bacteria &quot;Wolbachia&quot; that live with &quot;O. volvulus&quot;.

More research into the mechanisms of post-ivermectin treatment SAE is needed to develop drugs that are appropriate for individuals with multiple parasitic infections.

One drug that has been proposed for the treatment of onchocerciasis is doxycycline. This drug is effective in killing both the adult worm of &quot;O. volvulus&quot; and &quot;Wolbachia&quot;, the bacteria believed to play a major role in the onset of onchocerciasis while having no effect on the microfilariae of &quot;L. loa&quot;. In a study done at five different co-endemic regions for onchocerciasis and loiasis, doxycycline was shown to be effective in treating over 12,000 individuals infected with both parasites with minimal complications. Drawbacks to using doxycycline include bacterial resistance and patient compliance because of a longer treatment regimen and the emergence of doxycycline-resistant &quot;Wolbachia&quot;. However, in the study over 97% of the patients complied with treatment, so it poses as a promising treatment for onchocerciasis while avoiding complications associated with &quot;L. loa&quot; co-infections.

An area of tremendous concern regarding loiasis is its co-endemicity with onchocerciasis in certain areas of west and central Africa, as mass ivermectin treatment of onchocerciasis can lead to SAEs in patients who have high &quot;Loa loa&quot; microfilarial densities, or loads. This fact necessitates the development of more specific diagnostics tests for &quot;Loa loa&quot; so that areas and individuals at a higher risk for neurologic consequences can be identified before microfilaricidal treatment. Additionally, the treatment of choice for loiasis, diethylcarbamazine, can lead to serious complications in and of itself when administered in standard doses to patients with high &quot;Loa loa&quot; microfilarial loads.

==History==
The first well-recorded case of &quot;Loa loa&quot; infection was noted in the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo in 1770. A French surgeon named Mongin tried but failed to remove a worm passing across a woman&#x27;s eye. A few years later, in 1778, the surgeon François Guyot noted worms in the eyes of West African slaves on a French ship to America; he successfully removed a worm from one man&#x27;s eye.

The identification of microfilariae was made in 1890 by the ophthalmologist Stephen McKenzie. Localized angioedema, a common clinical presentation of loiasis, was observed in 1895 in the coastal Nigerian town of Calabar—hence the name &quot;Calabar&quot; swellings. This observation was made by a Scottish ophthalmologist named Douglas Argyll-Robertson, but the association between &quot;Loa loa&quot; and Calabar swellings was not realized until 1910 (by Patrick Manson). The determination of vector—&quot;Chrysops&quot; spp.—was made in 1912 by the British parasitologist Robert Thomson Leiper.

==Synonyms==
Synonyms for the disease include African eye worm, loaiasis, loaina, &quot;Loa loa&quot; filariasis, filaria loa, filaria lacrimalis, filaria subconjunctivalis, Calabar swellings, fugitive swellings, and microfilaria diurnal. &quot;Loa loa&quot;, the scientific name for the infectious agent, is an Indigenous term itself and there are likely many other terms used from region to region.

<text>James Stephen Fossett (April 22, 1944 – September 3, 2007) was an American businessman and a record-setting aviator, sailor, and adventurer. He was the first person to fly solo nonstop around the world in a balloon and in a fixed-wing aircraft. He made his fortune in the financial services industry and held world records for five nonstop circumnavigations of the Earth: as a long-distance solo balloonist, as a sailor, and as a solo flight fixed-wing aircraft pilot.

A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club, Fossett set more than one hundred records in five different sports, sixty of which still stood at the time of his death. He broke three of the seven absolute world records for fixed-wing aircraft recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, all in his Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer. In 2002, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Aero Club of the UK, and was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2007.

Fossett disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying a light aircraft over the Great Basin Desert, between Nevada and California. Fossett&#x27;s plane was discovered wrecked in 2008.

==Early years==
Fossett was born in Jackson, Tennessee and grew up in Garden Grove, California, where he graduated from Garden Grove High School.

Fossett&#x27;s interest in adventure began early. As a Boy Scout, he grew up climbing the mountains of California, beginning with the San Jacinto Mountains. &quot;When I was 12 years old I climbed my first mountain, and I just kept going, taking on more diverse and grander projects.&quot; Fossett said that he did not have a natural gift for athletics or team sports, so he focused on activities that required persistence and endurance. His father, an Eagle Scout, encouraged Fossett to pursue these types of adventures and encouraged him to become involved with the Boy Scouts early. He became an active member of Troop 170 in Orange, California. At age 13, Fossett earned the Boy Scouts&#x27; highest rank of Eagle Scout. He was a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow, the Boy Scouts&#x27; honor society, where he served as lodge chief. He also worked as a Ranger at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico during the summer of 1961. Fossett said in 2006 that Scouting was the most important activity of his youth.

In college at Stanford University, Fossett was already known as an adventurer; his Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brothers convinced him to swim to Alcatraz and raise a banner that read &quot;Beat Cal&quot; on the wall of the prison, closed two years previously. He made the swim but was thwarted by a security guard when he arrived. While at Stanford, Fossett was a student body officer and served as the president of a few clubs. In 1966, Fossett graduated from Stanford with a degree in economics. Fossett spent the following summer in Europe climbing mountains and swimming the Dardanelles.

==Business career==
In 1968, Fossett received an MBA from the Olin School of Business at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was later a longtime member of the Board of Trustees. Fossett&#x27;s first job out of business school was with IBM; he then served as a consultant for Deloitte and Touche, and later accepted a job with Marshall Field&#x27;s. Fossett later said, &quot;For the first five years of my business career, I was distracted by being in computer systems, and then I became interested in financial markets. That&#x27;s where I thrived.&quot;

Fossett then became a successful commodities salesman in Chicago, first for Merrill Lynch in 1973, where he proved a highly successful producer of commission revenue for himself and that firm. He began working in 1976 for Drexel Burnham, which assigned him one of its memberships on the Chicago Board of Trade and permitted him to market the services of the firm from a phone on the floor of that exchange. In 1980, Fossett began the process that eventually produced his enduring prosperity: renting exchange memberships to would-be floor traders, first on the Chicago Board Options Exchange.

After fifteen years of working for other companies, Fossett founded his own firms, Marathon Securities and Lakota Trading, from which he made millions renting exchange memberships. He founded Lakota Trading for that purpose in 1980. In the early 1980s, he founded Marathon Securities and extended that successful formula to memberships on the New York stock exchanges. He earned millions renting floor trading privileges (exchange memberships) to hopeful new floor traders, who also paid clearing fees to Fossett&#x27;s clearing firms in proportion to the trading activity of those renting the memberships. In 1997, the trading volume of its rented memberships was larger than any other clearing firm on the Chicago exchange. Lakota Trading replicated that same business plan on many exchanges in the United States and also in London. Fossett later used those revenues to finance his adventures. Fossett said, &quot;As a floor trader, I was very aggressive and worked hard. Those same traits help me in adventure sports.&quot;

Fossett said he did not participate in any of the &quot;interesting things&quot; he had done in college during his time in exchange-related activities: &quot;There was a period of time where I wasn&#x27;t doing anything except working for a living. I became very frustrated with that and finally made up my mind to start getting back into things.&quot; He began to take six weeks a year off to spend time on sports and moved to Beaver Creek, Colorado in 1990. Fossett later sold most of his business interests, although he maintained an office in Chicago until 2006.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Fossett married Peggy Fossett (née Viehland), who was originally from Richmond Heights, Missouri. They had no children. The Fossetts had homes in Beaver Creek, Colorado and Chicago, and a vacation home in Carmel, California. Fossett was friends with billionaire Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group sponsored some of Fossett&#x27;s adventures.

==Records==

===Overview===
Steve Fossett was well known for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft. He was an aviator of exceptional breadth of experience. He wanted to become the first person to achieve a solo balloon flight around the world (finally succeeding on his sixth attempt, in 2002, becoming the first person to complete an uninterrupted and unrefueled solo circumnavigation of the world in &quot;any&quot; kind of aircraft). He set, with co-pilot Terry Delore, 10 of the 21 Glider Open records, including the first 2,000 km Out-and-Return, the first 1,500 km Triangle and the longest Straight Distance flights. His achievements as a jet pilot in a Cessna Citation X include records for U.S. Transcontinental, Australia Transcontinental, and Round-the-World westbound non-supersonic flights. Prior to Fossett&#x27;s aviation records, no pilot had held world records in more than one class of aircraft; Fossett held them in four classes.

In 2005, Fossett made the first solo, nonstop unrefueled circumnavigation of the world in an airplane, in 67 hours in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, a single-engine jet aircraft.

In 2006, he again circumnavigated the globe nonstop and unrefueled in 76 hours, 45 minutes in the &quot;GlobalFlyer&quot;, setting the record for the longest flight by any aircraft in history with a distance of 25,766 statute miles (41,467 km).

He set 91 aviation world records ratified by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, of which 36 stand, plus 23 sailing world records ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council.

On August 29, 2006, he set the world altitude record for gliders over El Calafate, Argentina at .

===Balloon pilot===
On February 21, 1995, Fossett landed in Leader, Saskatchewan, Canada, after taking off from South Korea, becoming the first person to make a solo flight across the Pacific Ocean in a balloon.

In 2002, he became the first person to fly around the world alone, nonstop in any kind of aircraft. He launched the 10-story high balloon &quot;Spirit of Freedom&quot; from Northam, Western Australia on June 19, 2002 and returned to Australia on July 3, 2002, subsequently landing in Queensland. Duration and distance of this solo balloon flight was 13 days, 8 hours, 33 minutes (14 days 19 hours 50 minutes to landing), 20,626.48 statute miles (33,195.10 km). The balloon dragged him along the ground for 20 minutes at the end of the flight. Only the capsule survived the landing; it was taken to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where it was displayed. The control center for the mission was in Brookings Hall at Washington University in St. Louis. Fossett&#x27;s top speed during the flight was over the Indian Ocean. The trip set a number of records for ballooning: Fastest (, breaking his own previous record of ), Fastest Around the World (13.5 days), Longest Distance Flown Solo in a Balloon (), and 24-Hour Balloon Distance ( on July 1).

While Fossett had financed five previous tries himself, his successful record-setting flight was sponsored by Bud Light. In the end, Fossett actually made money on all his balloon flights. He bought a contingency insurance policy for $500,000 that would pay him $3 million if he succeeded in the flight. Along with sponsorship, that payment meant that in the end Fossett did not have to spend any of his money other than for initial expenses.

===Sailor===
Fossett was one of sailing&#x27;s most prolific distance record holders. Speed sailing was his specialty and from 1993 to 2004 he dominated the record sheets, setting 23 official world records and nine distance race records. He is recognized by the World Sailing Speed Record Council as &quot;the world&#x27;s most accomplished speed sailor&quot;.

On the maxi-catamaran Cheyenne (formerly named &quot;PlayStation&quot;), Fossett twice set the prestigious 24 Hour Record of Sailing. In October 2001, Fossett and his crew set a transatlantic record of 4 days 17 hours, shattering the previous record by 43 hours 35 minutes; an increase in average speed of nearly seven knots.

In early 2004, Fossett, as skipper, set the Around the world sailing record of 58 days, 9 hours in &quot;Cheyenne&quot; with a crew of 13. In 2007, Fossett held the world record for crossing the Pacific Ocean in his sailboat, the &quot;PlayStation&quot;, which he accomplished on his fourth try.

===Airship pilot===
Fossett set the Absolute World Speed Record for airships on October 27, 2004. The new record for fastest flight was accomplished with a Zeppelin NT, at a recorded average speed of . The previous record was set in 2001 in a Virgin airship. In 2006, Fossett was one of only 17 pilots in the world licensed to fly the Zeppelin.

===Fixed-wing aircraft pilot===
====GlobalFlyer====
Fossett made the first solo nonstop unrefueled fixed-wing aircraft flight around the world between February 28 and March 3, 2005. He took off from Salina, Kansas, where he was assisted by faculty members and students from Kansas State University, and flew eastbound with the prevailing winds, returning to Salina after 67 hours, 1 minute, 10 seconds, without refueling or making intermediate landings. His average speed of was also the absolute world record for &quot;speed around the world, nonstop and non-refueled.&quot; His aircraft, the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, had a carbon fiber reinforced plastic airframe with a single Williams FJ44 turbofan engine. It was designed and built by Burt Rutan and his company, Scaled Composites, for long-distance solo flight. The fuel fraction, the weight of the fuel divided by the weight of the aircraft at take-off, was 83 percent.

On February 11, 2006, Fossett set the absolute world record for &quot;distance without landing&quot; by flying from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, around the world eastbound, then upon returning to Florida continuing across the Atlantic a second time to land in Bournemouth, England. The official distance was 25,766 statute miles (41,467 km) and the duration was 76 hours 45 minutes.

The next month, Fossett made a third flight around the world in order to break the absolute record for &quot;Distance over a closed circuit without landing&quot; (with takeoff and landing at the same airport). He took off from Salina, Kansas on March 14, 2006 and returned on March 17, 2006 after flying 25,262 statute miles (40,655 km).

There are only seven absolute world records for fixed-wing aircraft recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale and Fossett broke three of them in the Virgin Atlantic &quot;GlobalFlyer&quot;. All three records were previously held by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager from their flight in the Voyager in 1986. Fossett contributed the &quot;GlobalFlyer&quot; to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s permanent collection. It is on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum. Fossett flew the plane to the Center and taxied the plane to the front door.

====Transcontinental aircraft records====
Fossett set two U.S. transcontinental fixed-wing aircraft records in the same day. On February 5, 2003, Fossett and co-pilot Doug Travis flew his Cessna Citation X jet from San Diego, California to Charleston, South Carolina in 2 hours, 56 minutes, 20 seconds, at an average speed of to smash the transcontinental record for non-supersonic jets.

He returned to San Diego, then flew the same course as co-pilot for fellow adventurer Joe Ritchie in Ritchie&#x27;s turboprop Piaggio Avanti. Their time was 3 hours, 51 minutes, 52 seconds, an average speed of , which broke the previous turboprop transcontinental record held by Chuck Yeager and Renald Davenport.

Fossett also set the east-to-west transcontinental record for non-supersonic fixed-wing aircraft on September 17, 2000. He flew from Jacksonville, Florida to San Diego, California in 3 hours, 29 minutes, at an average speed of .

====First trans-Atlantic flight re-enactment====
On July 2, 2005, Fossett and co-pilot Mark Rebholz recreated the first nonstop crossing of the Atlantic which was made by the British team of John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June 1919 in a Vickers Vimy biplane. Their flight from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, Canada to Clifden, County Galway, Ireland in the open cockpit Vickers Vimy replica took 18 hours 25 minutes with 13 hours flown in instrument flight conditions. Because there was no airport in Clifden, Fossett and Rebholz landed on the 8th fairway of the Connemara Golf Links.

====Glider records====
The team of Steve Fossett and Terry Delore (NZ) set ten official world records in gliders while flying in three major locations: New Zealand, Argentina, and Nevada, United States. An asterisk (*) indicates records subsequently broken by other pilots.

* 1,000 km Out-and-Return World Record* , December 12, 2002.
* 750 Kilometer Triangle World Record* , July 29, 2003.
* 1,250 Kilometer Triangle U.S. National Record , July 30, 2003. Exceeded world record by 0.01 km/h.
* 1,500 km Out-and-Return World Record* , November 14, 2003.
* Out-and-Return Distance (Declared) World Record* 1,804.7 km, November 14, 2003.
* Out and Return Distance (Free) World Record* 2,002.44 km, November 14, 2003.
* 500 Kilometer Triangle World Record* , November 15, 2003.
* 1,500 Kilometer Triangle World Record , December 13, 2003.
* Triangle Distance (Declared) World Record* 1,502.6 km, December 13, 2003.
* Triangle Distance (Free) World Record* 1,509.7 km, December 13, 2003.
* Distance (Free) World Record 2,192.9 km, December 4, 2004.

Fossett and co-pilot Einar Enevoldson flew a glider into the stratosphere on August 29, 2006. The flight set the Absolute Altitude Record for gliders at . Since the glider cockpit was unpressurized, the pilots wore full pressure suits (similar to space suits) so that they would be able to fly to altitudes above . Fossett and Enevoldson had made previous attempts in three countries over a period of five years before finally succeeding with this record flight. This endeavor is known as the Perlan Project.

===Cross-country skiing===
As a young adventurer, Fossett was one of the first participants in the Worldloppet, a series of cross-country ski marathons around the world. While he had little experience as a skier, he was in the first group of &#x27;citizen athletes&#x27; to participate in the series debut in 1979. And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an Aspen to Vail record of 59 h, 53 min, 30 s in February 1998, and an Aspen to Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.

===Mountain climbing===
Fossett was a lifelong mountain climber and had climbed the highest peaks on six of the seven continents. In the 1980s, he became friends with Patrick Morrow, who was attempting to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents for the &quot;Seven Summits&quot; world record, which Morrow achieved in 1985. Fossett accompanied Morrow for his last three peaks, including Vinson Massif in Antarctica, Carstensz Pyramid in Oceania, and Elbrus in Europe. While Fossett went on to climb almost all of the Seven Summits peaks himself, he declined to climb Mount Everest in 1992 due to asthma. He later returned to Antarctica to climb again.

===Other accomplishments===
Fossett competed in and completed premier endurance sports events, including the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, in which he finished 47th on his second try in 1992 after training for five years. He became the 270th person to swim across the English Channel on his fourth try in September 1985 with a time of 22 hours, 15 minutes. Although Fossett said he was not a good enough swimmer &quot;to make the varsity swim team&quot;, he found that he could swim for long periods. Fossett competed in the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii (finishing in 1996 in 15:53:10), the Boston Marathon, and the Leadville Trail 100, a Colorado ultramarathon which involves running up to elevations of more than in the Rocky Mountains.

Fossett raced cars in the mid-1970s and later returned to the sport in the 1990s. He competed in the 24 hours of Le Mans road race in 1993 and in 1996, along with the Dakar Rally.

====24 Hours of Le Mans results====
===Previous attempts at records===

Fossett tried six times over seven years for the first solo balloon circumnavigation. His fifth attempt cost him $1.25 million of his own money; his sixth and successful attempt was commercially sponsored. Two of the attempts were launched from Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. Washington University in St. Louis served as control center for four of the six flights, including the record-breaking one.

In 1998, one of the unsuccessful attempts at the ballooning record ended with a five-mile (8 km) plummet into the Coral Sea off the coast of Australia that nearly killed Fossett; he waited 72 hours to be rescued, at a cost of $500,000. The first attempt began in the Black Hills of South Dakota and ended outside Hampton, New Brunswick later. The second attempt, launched from Busch Stadium, cost $300,000 and lasted before being downed halfway in a tree in India; the trip set records at the time for duration and distance of flight (with Fossett doubling his own previous record) and was called &quot;Solo Spirit&quot; after Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. Fossett slept an average of two hours a night for the six-day journey, conducted in below-zero temperatures. After taking too much fuel to cross the Atlantic Ocean and circling Libya for 12 hours while officials decided whether or not to allow him into their airspace, Fossett did not have enough fuel to finish the flight. That year, Fossett flew farther for less money than better-financed expeditions (including one supported by Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson) in part due to his ability to fly in an unpressurized capsule, a result of his heavy physical training at high altitudes. The &quot;Solo Spirit&quot; capsule was put on display at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum across from the &quot;Apollo 11&quot; command module.
In 2006, Fossett purchased the Formula Shell LSRV &quot;Spirit of America&quot; from former land speed record holder Craig Breedlove. He rechristened the vehicle the &quot;Spirit of America Sonic Arrow&quot; and set about making improvements to the vehicle to break the land speed record. Fossett was initially unable to break even with the vehicle but eventually hoped to raise its top speed to and even . After his disappearance and death, his team&#x27;s efforts continued until 2008. The vehicle was put up for auction in 2010.

==Scouting==
Fossett grew up in Garden Grove, California and earned the Eagle Scout award in 1957. He credited his experience in Scouting as a foundation for much of his later success. &quot;As a Scout, I learned how to set goals and achieve them,&quot; he once said. &quot;Being a Scout also taught me leadership at a young age when there are few opportunities to be a leader. Scouting values have remained with me throughout my life, in my business career, and now as I take on new challenges.&quot; In his later years, he was described as a &quot;legend&quot; by fellow Scouts. As a national BSA volunteer, he served as Chairman of the Northern Tier High Adventure Committee, Chairman of the Venturing Committee, member of the Philmont Ranch Committee, and member of the National Advisory Council. He later became a member of the BSA National Executive Board, and in 2007, Fossett succeeded Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as president of the National Eagle Scout Association. Fossett previously had served on the World Scout Committee.

Fossett was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1992. In 1999, he received the Silver Buffalo Award, BSA&#x27;s highest recognition of service to youth.

==Awards and honors==

In 2002, Fossett received aviation&#x27;s highest award, the Gold Medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) and in July 2007, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. He was presented at the ceremony by Dick Rutan.

In 1997, Fossett was inducted into the Balloon and Airship Hall of Fame. In February 2002, Fossett was named America&#x27;s Rolex Yachtsman of the Year by the American Sailing Association at the New York Yacht Club. He was the oldest recipient of the award in its 41-year history, and the only recipient to fly himself to the ceremony in his own plane.

He received the Explorers Medal from the Explorers Club following his solo balloon circumnavigation. He was given the Diplôme de Montgolfier by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 1996. He received the Harmon Trophy, given annually &quot;to the world&#x27;s outstanding aviator and aeronaut&quot;, in 1998 and 2002. He received the Grande Médaille of the Aéro-Club de France, and the British Royal Aero Club&#x27;s Gold Medal in 2002. He received the Order of Magellan and the French Republic&#x27;s Médaille de l&#x27;Aéronautique in 2003.

The White Knight Two VMS &quot;Spirit of Steve Fossett&quot; was named in Fossett&#x27;s honor by his friend Richard Branson in late 2007. Following his disappearance, Peggy Fossett and Dick Rutan accepted the Spread Wings Award on Fossett&#x27;s behalf at the 2007 Spreading Wings Gala, Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum, Denver, Colorado.

In 2010, Fossett was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

==Death==
===Disappearance and search===

At 8:45 a.m. on the morning of Monday, September 3, 2007, Fossett took off in a single-engine Champion 8KCAB Super Decathlon light aircraft from the Flying-M Ranch private airstrip, near Smith Valley, Nevada. When he failed to return, searches were launched about six hours later. There was no signal from the plane&#x27;s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) designed to be automatically activated in the event of a crash, but it was of an older type notorious for failing to operate after a crash.

It was first thought that Fossett may have also been wearing a Breitling Emergency watch with a manually operated ELT that had a range of up to , but no signal was received from it. On September 13, Fossett&#x27;s wife, Peggy, issued a statement clarifying that he owned such a watch but was not wearing it when he took off for the Labor Day flight.
Fossett took off with enough fuel for four to five hours of flight, according to spokesperson Major Cynthia S. Ryan, Public Information Officer with the Civil Air Patrol (CAP). Searchers with CAP were told that Fossett had gone out for a short flight, possibly including the areas of Lucky Boy Pass and Walker Lake. CAP Major Cynthia Ryan suggested that he might have been out scouting for potential sites to conduct a planned land speed run, though Fossett&#x27;s wife said the flight was a pleasure trip. Fossett apparently did not file a flight plan and was not required to do so.

On the second day, CAP aircraft searched but found no trace of wreckage after initiating a complex and expanding search of what later evolved into a nearly area of some of the most rugged terrain in North America. On the first day of CAP searching, operations were suspended by mid-day due to high winds, according to Ryan. By the fourth day, the CAP was using fourteen aircraft in the search effort, including one equipped with the ARCHER system that could automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the missing aircraft.

By September 10, search crews reported eight previously unidentified crash sites, some of which were decades old. After accounting for double-counted sites and prior wrecks recorded by the NTSB, this was reduced to three previously undiscovered plane wrecks. The urgency of what was still regarded as a rescue mission meant that minimal immediate effort was made to identify the aircraft in the uncharted crash sites, although some had speculated that one could have belonged to Charles Clifford Ogle, missing since 1964. 
About two dozen aircraft were involved in the massive search, operating from the primary search base at Minden, Nevada, with a secondary search base located at Bishop, California.

On September 7, Google Inc. helped the search for the aviator through its connections to contractors that provide satellite imagery for its Google Earth software. British entrepreneur Richard Branson, a friend of Fossett, said he and others were coordinating efforts with Google to see if any of the high-resolution images might include Fossett&#x27;s aircraft.

On September 8, the first of a series of new high-resolution imagery from DigitalGlobe was made available via the Amazon Mechanical Turk beta website so that users could flag potential areas of interest for searching. By September 11, up to 50,000 people had joined the effort, scrutinizing more than 300,000 278-square-foot () squares of the imagery. Peter Cohen of Amazon believed that by September 11, the entire search area had been covered at least once.

Amazon&#x27;s search effort was shut down the week of October 29, without any measurable success. Major Cynthia Ryan later said it had been more of a hindrance than a help. She said that persons purporting to have seen the aircraft on the Mechanical Turk or have special knowledge clogged her email during critical days of the search, and for even months afterward. Many of the ostensible sightings proved to be images of CAP aircraft flying search grids, or simply mistaken artifacts of old images.

Psychics flooded the search base in Minden with predictions of where the aviator could be found. One man from Canada was particularly persistent with daily calls to Ryan. Ryan noted that every message, letter, or phone call was taken seriously, which swamped the USAF specialists assigned the task of reviewing every one of them without regard to apparent plausibility. In retrospect, the crowdsource effort was &quot;not ready for prime time&quot;, according to Ryan.

On September 12, survival experts speculated that Fossett was likely to be dead.

On September 17, the Nevada wing of the Civil Air Patrol said it was suspending all flights in connection with its search operations, but National Guard search flights, private search flights and ground searches continued.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began a preliminary investigation into the likely crash of the plane that Fossett was flying. The preliminary report stated that Fossett was &quot;presumed fatally injured and the aircraft substantially damaged&quot;, but was subsequently revised to remove that assumption. Branson made similar public statements.

On September 19, 2007, authorities confirmed they would stop actively looking for Fossett in the Nevada Desert, but would keep air crews on standby to fly to possible crash sites. On September 30, it was announced that after further analysis of radar data from the day of his disappearance, ground teams and two aircraft had resumed the search.

On October 2, 2007, CAP announced it had called off its search operation. Ryan later noted that the search was the largest, most complex peacetime search for an individual in U.S. history.

In July 2008, Simon Donato&#x27;s Team Adventure Science searched for a week on the Nevada–California border. On August 23, 2008, almost a year after Fossett disappeared, twenty-eight friends and admirers conducted a foot search based on new information and computer modeling. That search concluded on September 10.

===Search and rescue costs===
On May 1, 2008, the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; attributed to Nevada State Governor Jim Gibbons&#x27; spokesman, Ben Kieckhefer, the Governor&#x27;s decision to direct the state to charge Steve Fossett&#x27;s family for the $687,000 expense of the search for Fossett. Kieckhefer later played that early report down, when he told the &quot;Tahoe Daily Tribune&quot; that Nevada did not intend to demand an involuntary payment from Fossett&#x27;s widow, but that such a payment would be voluntary: &quot;We are going to request that they help offset some of these expenses, considering the scope of the search, the overall cost as well as our ongoing budget difficulties.&quot; Hotelier Barron Hilton, from whose ranch Fossett had departed on the day he went missing, had previously volunteered $200,000 to help pay for the search costs.

In his later comments to the &quot;Tahoe Daily Tribune&quot;, Kieckhefer denied outright that a bill for the family was being prepared. Kieckefer said, &quot;It will probably be in the form of a letter&quot;, which he indicated would include a financial outline of the steps taken by the state, the associated costs, and a mention of the state&#x27;s ongoing budget difficulties.

Days prior to this announcement, state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that &quot;there is no precedent where government will go after people for costs just because they have money to pay for it. You get lost, and we look for you. It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for&quot;, although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons.

At an April 10, 2008, Legislature&#x27;s Interim Finance Committee hearing, Siracusa indicated that he had hired an independent auditor to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett, but added, &quot;We are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong&quot;. Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond.

In a later interview with the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;, Siracusa stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor for the purpose of later challenging the state&#x27;s financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation. Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment, Arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs.

The Nevada search cost $1.6 million, &quot;the largest search and rescue effort ever conducted for a person within the U.S.&quot; Jim Gibbons asked Fossett&#x27;s estate to shoulder $487,000, but it declined, saying Fossett&#x27;s wife had already spent $1 million on private searching.

===Recovery of wreckage and remains===
On September 29, 2008, a hiker found three crumpled identification cards in the eastern Sierra Nevada in California about south (186 degrees) of Fossett&#x27;s take-off site. The items were confirmed as belonging to Fossett and included an FAA-issued card, his Soaring Society of America membership card and $1,005 in cash.

On October 1, late in the day, air search teams spotted wreckage on the ground at an elevation of , about from where the personal items had been found. Later that evening the teams confirmed identification of the tail number of Fossett&#x27;s plane.

The crash site is located on the western side of a ridge (Volcanic Ridge) whose orientation is northwest/southeast, at . The site is about below the crest of the ridge. The steep terrain was sparsely forested with Ponderosa pines averaging to tall. Numerous boulders and rock outcrops surrounded by grassy areas covered the ground.
The crash site is within the Ansel Adams Wilderness in Madera County, California. Other named places near the site include Minaret Mine ( west), Emily Lake ( northeast), Minaret Lake ( west-southwest), the Minaret peaks ( west), Devils Postpile National Monument ( southeast), and the town of Mammoth Lakes (the nearest populated place, east-southeast). The site is east of Yosemite National Park.

Over the next two days, ground searchers found four bone fragments that were about in size. However, the bones were found to be either not human or too small for DNA tests.

On October 29, search teams recovered two large human bones that they suspected might belong to Fossett. These bones were found east of the crash site. Tennis shoes with animal bite marks on them were also recovered.

On November 3, California police coroners said that DNA profiling of the two bones by a California Department of Justice forensics laboratory confirmed a match to Fossett&#x27;s DNA. Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said Fossett would have died on impact in such a crash, and that it was not unusual for animals to drag remains away.

===NTSB report and findings===
On March 5, 2009, the NTSB issued its report and findings. The report states that the plane crashed at an elevation of about , below the crest of the ridge. The elevation of peaks in the area exceeded . However, the density altitude in the area at the time and place of the crash was estimated to be .

The aircraft, a tandem two-seater, was nearly 30 years old and Fossett had flown approximately 40 hours in this type. The plane&#x27;s operating manual says that at an altitude of the rate of climb would be 300 feet per minute (about 1.5 m/s).

The NTSB report says that &quot;a meteorologist from Salinas provided a numerical simulation of the conditions in the accident area using the WRF-ARW (Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting) numerical model. At 0930 [the approximate time of the crash] the model displayed downdrafts in that area of approximately 300 feet per minute.&quot; There was no evidence of equipment failure.

The report stated that a postmortem examination of the skeletal fragments had been performed under the auspices of the Madera County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The cause of death was determined to be multiple traumatic injuries. The ELT was destroyed by the crash.

On July 9, 2009, the NTSB declared the probable cause of the crash as &quot;the pilot&#x27;s inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane. Contributing to the accident were the downdrafts, high density altitude, and mountainous terrain.&quot;

<text>Loa loa is a filarial (arthropod-borne) nematode (roundworm) that causes &quot;Loa loa&quot; filariasis. &quot;Loa loa&quot; actually means &quot;worm worm&quot;, but is commonly known as the &quot;eye worm&quot;, as it localizes to the conjunctiva of the eye. &quot;Loa loa&quot; is commonly found in Africa. It mainly inhabits rain forests in West Africa and has native origins in Ethiopia. The disease caused by &quot;Loa loa&quot; is called loiasis and is one of the neglected tropical diseases.

&quot;L. loa&quot; is one of three parasitic filarial nematodes that cause subcutaneous filariasis in humans. The other two are &quot;Mansonella streptocerca and Onchocerca volvulus&quot; (causes river blindness).

Maturing larvae and adults of the &quot;eye worm&quot; occupy the subcutaneous layer of the skin – the fat layer – of humans, causing disease. The &quot;L. loa&quot; adult worm which travels under the skin can survive up to 10–15 years, causing inflammations known as Calabar swellings. The adult worm travels under the skin, where the female deposits the microfilariae which can develop in the host’s blood within 5 to 6 months and can survive up to 17 years. The young larvae, or microfilariae, develop in horseflies of the genus &quot;Chrysops&quot; (deer flies, yellow flies), including the species &quot;C. dimidiata&quot; and &quot;C. silacea&quot;, which infect humans by biting them. After bites from these infected flies, the microfilariae are unique in that they travel in the peripheral blood during the day and migrate into the lungs at night.

==Morphology==

&quot;L. loa&quot; worms have a simple structure consisting of a head (which lacks lips), a body, and a blunt tail. The outer body of the worm is composed of a cuticle with three main layers made up of collagen and other compounds which aid in protecting the nematodes while they are inside the digestive system of their host. Juveniles have a similar appearance to adult worms, but are significantly smaller. Male adults range from 20 to 34 mm long and 350 to 430 μm wide. Female adults range from 20 to 70 mm long and can be about 425 μm wide. They vary in color.

==Lifecycle ==

The human is the definitive host, in which the parasitic worms attain sexual maturity, mate, and produce microfilariae. The flies serve as intermediate hosts in which the microfilariae undergo part of their morphological development, and then are borne to the next definitive host.

Two species of &quot;Chrysops&quot; deerflies, &quot;C. silacea&quot; and &quot;C. dimidiata&quot;, are the main vectors for this filariasis. 
# A fly bearing third-stage filarial larvae in its proboscis infects the human host through the bite wound. 
# After entering the human host, the larvae mature into adults, commonly in subcutaneous tissue. Adult females measure about 40 to 70 mm in length and 0.5 mm in diameter. Males measure some 30 to 34 mm by 0.35 to 0.43 mm.
# The adult female produces large numbers of microfilariae, about 250 to 300 μm in length and 6-8 μm in width. She continues to do so continuously for her lifetime, which typically spans several years. 
# Microfilariae tend to reside within spinal fluids, urine, and sputum; by day, they also circulate in the bloodstream. Apart from their presence in bodily fluids, however, microfilariae in the noncirculating phase also occur in the lungs.
# The vector fly ingests microfilariae while feeding on the host&#x27;s blood. 
# Once inside the vector, the microfilaria sheds its sheaths and escapes through the walls of the midgut into the fly’s haemocoel.
# It then migrates through the hemolymph into the wing muscles in the fly&#x27;s thorax. 
# In the thoracic muscles, the microfilaria develops successively into a first-stage larva, second-stage larva, and finally into the infectious third-stage larva. 
# The third-stage larva migrates to the fly’s proboscis. 
# Once the larva is established in the proboscis and the fly takes its next human blood meal, the cycle of infection continues.

== Disease ==
===Signs and symptoms===

Usually, about five months are needed for larvae (transferred from a fly) to mature into adult worms, which they can only do inside the human body. The most common display of infection is the localized allergic inflammations called Calabar or Cameroon swellings that signify the migration of the adult worm in the tissues away from the injection site by the vector. The migration does not cause significant damage to the host and is referred to as benign. However, these swellings can be painful, as they are mostly found near the joints.

Although most infections with &quot;L. loa&quot; are asymptomatic, symptoms generally do not appear until years, or even more than a decade, after the bite from an infected fly. However, symptoms can appear as early as four months after a bite. These parasites have a diurnal periodicity in which they circulate in the peripheral blood during the daytime, but migrate to vascular parts of the lungs during the night, where they are considered non circulatory. Therefore, the appearing and disappearing characteristics of this parasite can cause recurrent swelling that can cause painful enlargements of cysts in the connective tissue surrounding tendons. Additionally, chronic abscesses can be caused by the dying worms.

The most visual sign of an adult worm infections is when the worm crosses the sclera of the eye, which causes significant pain to the host and is usually associated with inflammation and less likely, blindness. Eye worms typically cause little eye damage and last a few hours to a week. Other tissues in which this worm can be found includes: the penis, testes, nipples, bridge of the nose, kidneys, and heart. The worms in these locations are not always externally visible.

===Risk factors===

People at the highest risk for acquiring loiasis are those who live in the rainforests of West or Central Africa. Furthermore, the probability of getting bitten by a deerfly increases during the day and during rainy seasons. The flies are also attracted to smoke from wood fires. These flies do not commonly enter houses, but they are attracted to the houses that are well lit, so will congregate outside.

Travelers can be infected in less than 30 days after arriving in an affected area, although they are more likely to be infected whilst being bitten by multiple deerflies over the course of many months. Men are more susceptible than women due to their increased exposure to the vectors during activities such as farming, hunting, and fishing.

===Diagnosis===

The main methods of diagnosis include the presence of microfilariae in the blood, the presence of a worm in the eye, and the presence of skin swellings. However, in cases where none of those is the case, a blood count can be done. Patients with infections have a higher number of blood cells, namely eosinophils, as well as high IgE levels that indicate an active infection with helminth parasites. Due to the migration of microfilariae during the day, the accuracy of a blood test can be increased when samples are taken between 10 am and 2 pm. A Giemsa stain is the most commonly used diagnostic test that uses a thick blood smear to count the microfilariae. Other than blood, microfilariae can also be observed in urine and saliva samples.

===Treatment===

Adult worms found in the eye can be surgically removed with forceps after being paralyzed with a topical anesthesia. The worm is not paralyzed completely, so if it is not extracted quickly, it can vanish upon attempting extraction.

Ivermectin has become the most common antiparasitic agent used worldwide, but can lead to residual microfilarial load when given in the management of loiasis. Treatment with ivermectin has shown to produce severe adverse neurological consequences in some cases. These treatment complications can be increased in individuals co-infected with onchocerciasis. Some of these patients experienced cases of coma and resultant encephalopathy, parkinsonism, and death. After about 12 hours, the first signs start to appear and include fatigue, pain in joints, mutism, and incontinence. Severe disorders of the consciousness start to develop after about a day.

Although Ivermectin is a common treatment for loiasis, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC). Symptoms may be resolved with as little as 1–2 courses of DEC. DEC is chosen over Ivermectin because evidence supports its ability to kill both the adult worms and the microfilariae, which are the main cause of the severe neurological problems mentioned above. In some cases, albendazole may also be an effective treatment used to reduce the microfilariae prior to treatment with DEC. The body&#x27;s response to albendazole is slow, so the patient being treated must be monitored closely and frequently to ensure it is effective.

===Prevention===

Currently, no control programs or vaccines for loiasis are available. However, diethylcarbamazine treatment is suggested to the reduce risk of infection. Avoiding areas where the vectors, deerflies, are found also reduces risk. This includes swamps, bogs, and shaded areas near rivers or near wood fires. Fly bites can be reduced by using insect repellents such as DEET and wearing long sleeves and pants during the daytime. Permethrin treatment on clothes is an additional repellent that could be used. Also, using malaria nets can reduce the number of fly bites acquired.

=== Epidemiology ===

Reports of microfilaremia have been made in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, and Sudan, and possibly rare cases in Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Uganda, and Zambia. Of the 10 countries that have high rates of infection, about 40% of the people who live in the area have reported being infected with the worm in the past. The population in high-risk areas is about 14.4 million; in addition, 15.2 million people live in areas where around 20–40% of people admitted to having the worm in the past.

Epidemiological studies have been emphasized in the western part of Africa. In this area, the disease is considered endemic. A study conducted by the Research Foundation in Tropical Diseases and Environment in 2002 had a sample of 1458 persons, spanning 16 different villages, and found&quot; Loa loa&quot; presence in these villages ranging from 2.22 to 19.23% of the population. The disease was found to be slightly more prevalent in men.

In a different country in western Africa, a cross-sectional community survey was conducted in Gabon, Africa. The study was performed by the department of Tsamba-Magotsi from August 2008 to February 2009. The study of 1,180 subjects evaluated the presence of microfilaria using microscopy. The carriage rate of &quot;L. loa&quot; in the subjects tested was 5%. This rate falls within the range of the study listed above.

In the western part of Africa, an increase in prevalence has been associated with the distribution of ivermectin, which is used to prevent the infection of onchocerciasis, which is also very prevalent in the same region. Patients with &quot;L. loa&quot; who are treated with ivermectin have extreme adverse effects, including death. Therefore, a prevalence mapping system was created called REMO. REMO is used to determine which areas to distribute the ivermectin based on lower levels of &quot;L. loa&quot; prevalence. The area discovered to be the most overlapping was where Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo overlap.

A study performed to review reported cases of &quot;L. loa&quot; in nonendemic countries in the past 25 years reviewed 102 cases of imported loiasis, 61 of them from Europe and 31 from the US. Three-quarters of the infestations were acquired in three countries considered endemic: Cameroon, Nigeria, and Gabon. In the subjects viewed, peripheral blood microfilariae were detected 61.4% of the time, eye worm migration 53.5% of the time, and Calabar swellings 41.6% of the time. A trend appeared in the symptoms of the patients where Calabar swellings and eosinophilia were more common among travelers. African immigrants tended to have microfilaremia. Eye worm migration was observed in a similar proportion between the two groups. Only 35 of the patients underwent clinical follow-up. The researchers concluded that &quot;L. loa&quot; would end up migrating to Europe and the United States, due to increased travel to already endemic regions.

<text>Diethylcarbamazine is a medication used in the treatment of filariasis including lymphatic filariasis, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, and loiasis. It may also be used for prevention of loiasis in those at high risk. While it has been used for onchocerciasis (river blindness), ivermectin is preferred. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include itching, facial swelling, headaches, and feeling tired. Other side effects include vision loss and dizziness. It is a recommended treatment in pregnancy and appears to be safe for the baby. The World Health Organization; however, recommends waiting until after pregnancy for treatment when feasible. It is made from 4-methyl-piperazine.
Diethylcarbamazine was discovered in 1947 by Yellapragada Subbarow. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is not commercially available in the United States but can be acquired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

==Medical uses==
Diethylcarbamazine is indicated for the treatment of people with certain filarial diseases, including lymphatic filariasis caused by infection with &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;, &quot;Brugia malayi&quot;, or &quot;Brugia timori&quot;; loiasis and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. The WHO recommends prescribing diethylcarbamazine to people who are infected with microfilariae of filarial parasites and also to control transmission of infection in filariasis-endemic areas.

In India and China, diethylcarbamazine has been added to salt to combat lymphatic filariasis.

== Contraindications ==
Contraindications are previous history of heart problems, gastrointestinal problems, and allergies.

Diethylcarbamazine is contraindicated in patients who may have onchocerciasis, due to the risk of the Mazzotti reaction.

==Mechanism==
Diethylcarbamazine is an inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism in microfilariae. This makes the microfilariae more susceptible to innate immune attack, but does not kill the parasites outright.

== Society and culture ==
=== Brand names ===
Brand names include Hetrazan, Carbilazine, Caricide, Cypip, Ethodryl, Notézine, Spatonin, Filaribits, Banocide Forte, and Eofil.

== Veterinary uses ==

Diethylcarbamazine is used to prevent heartworm in dogs.

<text>Naseby is a village in West Northamptonshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 687.

The village is north of Northampton, northeast of Daventry, and south of Market Harborough.

==Geography==
The village sits in a commanding position on one of the highest parts of the Northamptonshire Uplands, close to the county border with Leicestershire.

==History==

===Early history===
The original settlement probably owes its existence to its geography; the village lay in a strong defensive position. In the 6th century a Saxon named Hnaef established the settlement with the name of Hnaefes-Burgh (&quot;fortified place of Hnaef&quot;). Evidence for these origins came in the form of a 19th-century discovery of an Anglo-Saxon trefoil-headed brooch which is now in the collection of the British Museum.

===Domesday Book to the Black Death===

In 1086 Naseby appeared in the Domesday Book, by which time Hnaefes-Burgh had evolved into Navesberie. In later records the village had been known as Navesby and Nathesby, eventually becoming Naseby. It was believed that the name derived from the Old English &quot;naefela&quot;, meaning navel, because it was thought to be the navel of England. In 1203, King John granted Naseby its market charter and the village became a flourishing market town for many years.

During this period the village grew. In 1349, the Black Death, which wiped out a third of the population of England, attacked the village and greatly reduced its population, with parts becoming abandoned altogether. Extensive earthworks in the fields adjacent to parts of the village show the outlines of lost lanes and the outlines of buildings and enclosures which existed before the Black Death.
===Battle of Naseby===

The Battle of Naseby took place on 14 June 1645, during the English Civil War. In the area called Broad Moor a small distance north of the village, the Royalist forces, commanded by King Charles I, battled the Roundhead army commanded by Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron. The battle resulted in a decisive Royalist defeat.

A naval warship during the Commonwealth period was named the in honour of the battle; after the Restoration the ship was renamed &quot;Royal Charles&quot;.

===18th century===
During the 18th century, Naseby continued as an agricultural community and during this time several fine Georgian buildings were constructed in the parish, including Manor Farm (built 1720), Shuckburgh House (1773), and the old Vicarage (1785). One of the most significant buildings is Naseby House, built in 1818 for the Fitzgeralds, Lords of the Manor. In the 20th century the hall hosted the Duke of York, later King George VI, with the Duchess of York, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon (the Queen Mother) and a very young future Queen Elizabeth. Naseby Hall, altered by E F Law in 1859 was badly damaged by fire in 1948, and was rebuilt from the ground up using the old materials.

Rev John Mastin was vicar of Naseby from 1783 until his death in 1829. He was the author of &quot;The History and Antiquities of Naseby, in the County of Northampton&quot;, which was the earliest published history of the parish. He also left a manuscript account of his life. The texts of both these works are included in a 2004 publication by the Northamptonshire Record Society.

===Nineteenth century===

In 1822 the Enclosure commissioners allocated the open land around the village to two landowners, who duly fenced off their newly acquired fields. This action deprived many of the villagers of their traditional plots of land that surrounded the village, that had for years allowed them to grow crops and graze their cattle and sheep. This action did not adversely affect the community as much as it did in other villages; one reason may have been that the village had other trades. A survey of the time lists 26 different occupations and trades in the village.

====1837 baptisms====
The local friendly society attracted non-conformists from the end of the eighteenth century and in 1825, a Methodist chapel was erected.
The population continued to grow: thus between 1831 and 1841 it increased from 707 to 898 (including 48 visitors to the annual feast).
In 1837, following the passing of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1836 there was a peak in the number of baptisms recorded in the Naseby parish register, relating to All Saints church. Whereas during the previous ten years the number per annum had varied between 7 and 24, in 1837 there were a total of 91 baptisms which amounted to 10.7% of the population given in the 1841 census. 50 of these occurred in the week before 1 July when civil registration was made mandatory. Most of those baptised were over the age of one, mostly children with the oldest age recorded being 26. One view is the prevalence of baptisms in this year is that non-conformists wished to ensure their children and young adults were recorded before the introduction of civil registration.

====Victorian building boom====

Until around 1870, most buildings (except for the church, chapel, school, and the three houses from the Georgian period) were made of mud walls and cob with thatched roofs. During the 1870s Lord Clifden had most of the cottages demolished and replaced with new red-brick cottages, some of which were semi-detached, to house his estate workers. This gave Naseby its well-known Victorian appearance. All these Victorian houses still survive to this day, along with two remaining 17th-century cob and thatched cottages.

==Churches==
The two churches in Naseby are:
* All Saints&#x27; Church, Church Street
* Naseby Methodist Church, Church Street

==River sources==
Naseby and the plateau of land towards Sibbertoft form a watershed and contain the sources of four rivers flowing west, south and east.

In the front garden of Manor Farm at the junction of Church Street, Newlands and Welford Road is a cone-shaped monument which sits in a depression. This is the source of the River Avon, Warwickshire.

The northern tributary of the River Nene (Brampton Arm) arises by the Thornby road to the west of the village (the main Source being at Arbury Hill (SP 542 581) near Staverton, Northamptonshire).

The source of the River Ise can be found close to Sibbertoft Road to the north of Naseby.

The source of the River Welland can be found in fields close to Welland Rise, Sibbertoft village, three miles to the north.

==Notable buildings==
The Historic England website contains details of a total of ten listed buildings in the parish of Naseby, all of which are Grade II apart from All Saints&#x27; Church, which is Grade II*. They are:
* All Saints&#x27; Church, Church Street
* Naseby Hall
* Shuckburgh House, Church Street
* Monument, Clipston Road
* Caton Cottage, High Street
* Cromwell Cottage, High Street
* Avon Well, south of Manor Farmhouse, Newlands
* Manor Farm, Newlands
* Whipping Cross, Newlands, Haselbech &amp; Clipston Road
* Monument, Sibbertoft Road
Details of some of these and other notable buildings in the village appear below.

Within the village at the junction of Church Street and Gynwell, close to the Methodist Chapel (1825) there is the shaft of the old whipping post dating to 1203. In the Middle Ages this stood opposite the church in what was the marketplace and is now the village street called Newlands.

Also to be found in Newlands are examples of the Victorian cottages from around 1870, which continue down the right-hand side of High Street; further down the street to the right is one of the two surviving cob-thatched cottages. It was built around 1630 and is now called Cromwell Cottage. Next door to the cottage in School Lane is the village school, built in 1843.

Further down School Lane are more Victorian cottages. At the end of School Lane with its intersection with Church Lane is the village war memorial. This memorial, built in 1918 to commemorate World War I, is a smaller copy of one of Edwin Henry Landseer&#x27;s four lions at Nelson&#x27;s Column in London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square. On the opposite side of Church Street from the memorial is the Old Vicarage, built around 1785. The two beech trees at the entrance were planted in 1792. Next to the vicarage is Shuckburgh House which dates from around 1773. The other surviving cob thatched cottage can be found at the southern end of High Street.

==Transport==
Naseby is from Junction 2 of the A14 road, giving it access to the national road system. For rail travel, the Midland Main Line can be accessed at the railway station in Market Harborough. There is a bus service between Market Harborough and Northampton that stops in Naseby, but it is very infrequent.

<text>CBBS (&quot;Computerized Bulletin Board System&quot;) was a computer program created by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess to allow them and other computer hobbyists to exchange information between each other. 

In January 1978, Chicago was hit by the Great Blizzard of 1978, which dumped record amounts of snow throughout the Midwest. Among those caught in the storm were Christensen and Suess, who were members of CACHE, the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists&#x27; Exchange. They had met at that computer club in the mid-1970s and become friends.

Christensen had created a file transfer protocol for sending binary computer files through modem connections, which was called, simply, MODEM. Later improvements to the program motivated a name change into the now familiar XMODEM. The success of this project encouraged further experiments. CACHE members frequently shared programs and had long been discussing some form of file transfer using modems, and Christensen was naturally at the center of these discussions; however, Suess in particular was skeptical of accomplishing such a project by a volunteer committee. Christensen and Suess became enamored of the extended idea of creating a computerized answering machine and message center, which would allow members to call in with their then-new modems and leave announcements for upcoming meetings.

However, they needed some quiet time to set aside for such a project, and the blizzard gave them that time. Christensen worked on the software and Suess cobbled together an S-100 computer to put the program on. They had a working version within two weeks, but claimed soon afterwards that it had taken four so that it wouldn&#x27;t seem like a &quot;rushed&quot; project. Time and tradition have settled that date to be February 16, 1978. Christensen and Suess described their innovation in an article entitled &quot;Hobbyist Computerized Bulletin Board&quot; in the November 1978 issue of &quot;Byte&quot; magazine.

Because the Internet was still small and not available to most computer users, users had to dial CBBS directly using a modem. Also because the CBBS hardware and software supported only a single modem for most of its existence, users had to take turns accessing the system, each hanging up when done to let someone else have access. Despite these limitations, the system was seen as very useful, and ran for many years and inspired the creation of many other bulletin board systems.
Ward &amp; Randy would often watch the users while they were online and comment or go into chat if the subject warranted. At times, online users wondered if Ward &amp; Randy actually existed.

The program had many forward thinking ideas, now accepted as in the creation of message bases or &quot;forums&quot;.

As Christensen and Suess went their separate ways, the CBBS name lived on, and survives to an extent as a web-based forum on Suess&#x27; website, chinet.com. Christensen&#x27;s version of CBBS, called &quot;Ward&#x27;s Board&quot;, closed in the early 1990s.

On February 16, 2003, Chicago&#x27;s Mayor Richard M. Daley declared the day &quot;BBS&quot; day in honor of the world&#x27;s first BBS being created 25 years ago that day. An article with a photo of Ward and the CBBS hardware appeared shortly thereafter in the Chicago Tribune.

There is still at least one active CBBS system as of August 2020.

<text>Bernard Joseph Butler (born 1 May 1970) is an English musician, songwriter and record producer. He has been hailed by some critics as the greatest guitarist of his generation; BBC journalist Mark Savage called him &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s most original and influential guitarists&quot;. He was voted the 24th greatest guitarist of the last 30 years in a national 2010 BBC poll and is often seen performing with a 1961 cherry red Gibson ES-355 TD SV (Stereo Varitone) with a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece.

==Early life==
Butler was born to Irish parents in North London on 1 May 1970. He spent his summers in his parents&#x27; hometown of Dún Laoghaire and in an interview given in 2022, he reflected on his upbringing and Irish immigration to Britain.

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the case now much, but definitely up to the generation where I was from. Just because of the migration in the sixties, I guess. That was the big thing in the &#x27;60s, and we all ended up in Manchester, Liverpool or North London. Places wherever the trains came into: Holyhead. Growing up, pretty much everyone I knew was Irish.

The youngest of three boys, Butler credits his oldest brother with inspiring his interest in music. The first vinyl record he bought was The Smiths&#x27; &quot;Hand in Glove&quot;, having become a fan of the band after hearing John Peel play &quot;Reel Around the Fountain&quot; on his BBC radio show. When he was eight, Butler started learning to play the violin, something which he later recalled he &quot;used to get beaten up and spat at on the bus for.&quot; His introduction to the guitar came after his brothers lost interest in a &quot;terrible electric guitar&quot;. Butler used it to play along with Johnny Marr&#x27;s guitar parts to The Smiths&#x27; songs, eventually learning each one note-by-note and becoming proficient without ever having a formal guitar lesson.

==Career==

===Suede (1989-1994)===

He first achieved fame in 1992 as the guitarist with Suede, forging a songwriting partnership with Brett Anderson. He co-wrote and played guitars or piano on every recording until 1994, when he exited Suede.

===McAlmont &amp; Butler (1994–1995, 2002–2004, 2006, 2014–present)===
Immediately after leaving Suede he formed the duo McAlmont &amp; Butler with David McAlmont and they released two singles, &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;You Do&quot;. A compilation album, &quot;The Sound Of... McAlmont &amp; Butler&quot;, was released after the collaboration ended.

===Solo (1998-1999, 2024)===
Butler then released two solo albums under his own name, &quot;People Move On&quot; and &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, on Creation Records, yielding the hit single &quot;Stay&quot;. In 2001 Butler teamed up with McAlmont for a second McAlmont &amp; Butler album, &quot;Bring it Back&quot;, and they toured the UK after the release of two singles, &quot;Falling&quot; and &quot;Bring it Back&quot;.
In March 2024, Butler announced his third solo album, &quot;Good Grief&quot;, due for release in May 2024.

===The Tears (2004-2006)===
In 2004 Butler formed a new band with Brett Anderson, The Tears, based on the same style that yielded their first successes with Suede in the early 1990s. The Tears released their debut LP, &quot;Here Come the Tears&quot;, produced by Butler, in June 2005. Singles include &quot;Refugees&quot;, which reached number 9 in the UK Singles Chart, and &quot;Lovers&quot;.

===Collaborations solo and production work===
Butler has played on and/or produced records by Aimee Mann, Edwyn Collins, Neneh Cherry, Tim Booth (of James), Eddi Reader, Hopper, Roy Orbison, Bert Jansch, The Libertines, Heather Nova, Mark Owen, The Veils, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, The Cribs, the Pretenders, The On-Off&#x27;s, 1990s, The Mescalitas, Cut Off Your Hands, Cajun Dance Party, Duffy, The View, Arkitekt, Sons and Daughters, Black Kids, Tricky, Sharleen Spiteri, Nerina Pallot, Natalie McCool and Pet Shop Boys.

In 2005 he was introduced to Welsh singer Duffy, and contributed to her top-selling debut album &quot;Rockferry&quot;—it was the best selling album of 2008 in the UK—which won the Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award in 2008.

In 2009 Butler co-wrote/produced/played on tracks by The Veils, Tommy Reilly, Jonathan Jeremiah, Kate Jackson and Catherine A.D who now performs as The Anchoress. He also commenced production work on Kate Nash&#x27;s second album &quot;My Best Friend Is You&quot; in mid-2009.

In 2010 Butler worked with Nerina Pallot, Fyfe Dangerfield, Noisettes, Slow Club, Gabrielle, Howling Bells, The Veils, Simon Dine, and new artists Jodie Marie, Vince, Daley, Summer Camp, Joe Worricker and Scott McFarnon.

Over the 2011–2012 period, Butler produced albums for Frankie &amp; The Heartstrings and continued working with Daley on his forthcoming &quot;Days &amp; Nights&quot; album, the title track of which was co-written and produced by Butler. He also co-wrote and produced Texas&#x27;s comeback album &quot;The Conversation&quot;. Butler again worked at Studio 355 for these recordings.

In 2013 Butler worked with the group Teleman, to finish their debut album; worked on songs with London group Flowers; and collaborated with Paloma Faith and Fyfe Dangerfield. In June 2013, he formed an impromptu improvisational performance at the Sunderland record store run by Frankie &amp; The Heartstrings. Alongside members of Warm Digits, Field Music and 1990s, the impromptu group played a completely unrehearsed and improvised set.

In August 2013, Butler played two shows at The Slaughtered Lamb in London, UK, accompanying Ben Watt on electric guitar, resulting in a touring and recording collaboration spanning 2 albums and several years of live shows across the globe.

In October 2013, new group Trans released the &quot;red&quot; EP, the first in a series of EPs for Rough Trade Records. Featuring tracks grown out of improvisational sessions that date back over a year, with Jackie McKeown, Paul Borchers and Igor Volk, the recordings were made at Studio 355. All sessions were improvised, recorded in their entirety and later edited with very few overdubs.

In May 2014, Butler organised two special McAlmont &amp; Butler performances to raise funds for The Bobath Centre&#x27;s work with children with cerebral palsy. The London shows at the Union Chapel and Islington Assembly Hall sold out, and the duo were accompanied by a full band that consisted of members of The Magic Numbers, Mako Sakamoto on drums and Sean Read on keyboards.

In 2017, Butler produced the self-titled debut album of the New York band QTY. In November 2019, Pet Shop Boys released their second single &quot;Burning The Heather&quot; from their forthcoming album &quot;Hotspot&quot;, featuring acoustic guitar played by Bernard Butler. Folk artist Sam Lee collaborated with Butler in 2019 resulting in his &quot;Old Wow&quot; album and selected live shows which followed. Butler joined Lee&#x27;s curated Earth Day live stream in May 2020 improvising remotely along to a live stream of nightingales singing in the Sussex forest. This was followed by the release of tracks from Roxanne De Bastion.
In 2020 writer Pete Paphides&#x27; label Needle Mythology finally released the open collaboration with Catherine Anne Davies. The album &quot;In Memory of My Feelings&quot; compiled 10 songs drawn from the writing sessions begun in 2009 which Butler then pieced together and completed. Artwork was created in collaboration with artist Eva Vermandel.

During 2021, Butler worked on a new Altered Images album with 1980s band members Clare Grogan and Stephen Lironi. According to Grogan, who announced the release in December 2021, the album would be released in August 2022, on Cooking Vinyl Records, with the name &quot;Mascara Streakz&quot;.

On 15 April 2022, Butler and Irish actress Jessie Buckley released &quot;The Eagle &amp; The Dove&quot;, the lead single from their album. &quot;For All Our Days That Tear the Heart&quot; was released on 17 June 2022.
The resulting album &quot;For All Our Days That Tear The Heart&quot; was released to widespread acclaim and resulted in a nomination for the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.
In 2023 Butler completed Sam Lee&#x27;s &quot;Songdreaming&quot; album and the debut from Irish band The Clockworks &quot;Exit Strategy&quot; He toured as &#x27;Butler, Blake, Grant&#x27; alongside songwriters Norman Blake and James Grant, a collaboration formed for the 2022 Celtic Connections. The trio continue to tour and have begun work on a debut record.
In 2024 released his first solo album in 25 years entitled &quot;Good Grief&quot; on his own 355 Recordings label. He will tour throughout 2024.

===Music in film and television===
Butler created the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;The James Gang&quot; and played on the soundtrack of &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, and in 2020 created the score to a BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; episode on Pluto.

===Radio Host===
Since 2017 Butler has hosted a radio show &quot;BB &amp; The King&quot;. Broadcast live from North London via Boogaloo Radio each Friday, Bernard Butler and partner Mark Kingston bring 2 hours of music and conversation around an episodic theme. Each week is archived via a Mixcloud page.

===Music Education===
Butler collaborated in songwriting camps and sessions for Warner-Chappell Publishing. He conducts audience-led PreProduction events around the country for the Musicians Union.
Butler is also a resident Lead Lecturer teaching the Songwriting BA degree course at BIMM London.

==Personal life==
On 13 April 2014, Butler participated in the London Marathon to raise funds for children with cerebral palsy, described by Butler as one of the &quot;worst starts in life&quot;. Butler explains:
The problem is it&#x27;s getting harder for families to get funding for therapy and children aren&#x27;t getting the specialist support they need. So I&#x27;m raising money for the charity&#x27;s treatment fund to make sure that children get seen as early as possible when it will have the greatest impact.

Butler is a proud Patron of the Bert Jansch Foundation. Set up in 2013, in the name of the legendary folk-guitarist and singer-songwriter, the Bert Jansch Foundation embraces the rich heritage of acoustic folk music and celebrates its creativity. Its charitable aims are to support young acoustic musicians with educational and early career opportunities.

&quot;When most people were just breathing, Bert was playing guitar. That sound really was his whole life; the vibrations of the strings were life-giving. The notes were like words and the whole sound a conversation.&quot;
Butler is also a Patron of the Music Venue Trust. Music Venue Trust is a UK Registered Charity which acts to protect, secure and improve UK Grassroots Music Venues for the benefit of venues, communities and upcoming artists.

==Awards==
Butler won the Producer&#x27;s Award at the 2009 BRIT Awards, Producer of the Year at the 2008 Music Managers Forum Awards, was nominated for Best Producer at the 2009 Music Week Awards, and received a Grammy Award for work on Duffy&#x27;s &quot;Rockferry&quot; which won the Best Pop Vocal Album award for 2009. His collaborative album with Jessie Buckley &#x27;For All Our Days That Tear The Heart&#x27; was nominated as one of the Albums Of The Year by the Mercury Prize 2022.

<text>The Eurasian griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) is a large Old World vulture in the bird of prey family Accipitridae. It is also known as the griffon vulture, although this term is sometimes used for the genus as a whole. It is not to be confused with the Rüppell&#x27;s vulture (&quot;Gyps rueppellii&quot;) and Himalayan vulture (&quot;Gyps himalayensis&quot;). It is closely related to the white-backed vulture (&quot;Gyps africanus&quot;).

The griffon vulture is long with a wingspan. In the nominate race the males weigh and females typically weigh , while in the Indian subspecies (&quot;G. f. fulvescens&quot;), the vultures average . Extreme adult weights have been reported from , the latter likely a weight attained in captivity. Hatched naked, it is a typical Old World vulture in appearance, with a white head, broad wings and short tail feathers. It has a white neck ruff and yellow bill. The buff body and wing coverts contrast with the dark flight feathers.

==Distribution and habitat==
In Italy, the Eurasian griffon vulture has survived only in the island of Sardinia, but there have been recent attempts to reintroduce it in the peninsula. As a result, several specimens were spotted in August 2006 on the Gran Sasso massif in central Italy. Populations in Italy are thought to be increasing thanks to reintroduction schemes in neighbouring countries and a ban on hunting it.

In Croatia, a Eurasian griffon vulture colony lives near the town of Beli on the island of Cres. There they breed at low elevations, with some nests at . Therefore, contact with people is common. The population makes frequent incursions in the Slovenian territory, especially in the mountain Stol above Kobarid. The bird is protected in an area called Kuntrep on the Croatian island of Krk.
In Ireland, the first record of a griffon vulture occurred in 1843 in Cork. In 2000, a vulture took up residence on the Channel Island of Guernsey.
In Cyprus, there was a colony of fewer than 30 Eurasian griffon vultures at Episkopi, in the south of the island in 2006.

In Israel, Eurasian griffon vulture colonies are present in the north and the Golan Heights. A large colony breeds in the Carmel Mountains, the Negev desert and especially at Gamla. Reintroduction projects are being carried out at breeding centres in Carmel Hai-Bar Nature Reserve and Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve.

In Greece, there are nearly 1000 Eurasian griffon vultures. The majority of this population resides in Crete, which hosts the largest insular population of the species in the world. On Crete they inhabit mountainous areas, sometimes in groups of up to 20.
Griffon vultures have been reintroduced successfully into the Massif Central in France; about 500 are now found there. Griffon vultures are regularly spotted over the Millau bridge, and since 2015 also in the Cantal Mountains.
* In Belgium and the Netherlands, around 100 Eurasian griffon vulture were present in the summer of 2007. These were vagrants from the Pyrenees population (see below).
* In Germany, the species died out in the mid-18th century. Some 200 vagrant birds, probably from the Pyrenees, were sighted in 2006, and several dozen of the vagrants sighted in Belgium the following year crossed into Germany in search for food. There are plans to reintroduce the species in the Alps. In September 2008, pieces of a griffon vulture bone, about 35,000 years old, were excavated from Hohle Fels cave in southern Germany, which are believed to form a flute.
In Serbia, there are around 60–65 pairs of Eurasian griffon vultures in the western parts of the country, around Zlatar mountain and also 35 birds in the canyon of the Trešnjica river. They are under legal protection from hunting.
In Austria, there is a remnant population around Salzburg Zoo, and vagrants from the Balkans are often seen.In Spain and France, in 2008, there were 25,000 birds, from a low of a few thousand around 1980. Spain has the biggest colony of Griffon vultures in all Europe. It is located at Hoces del Río Duratón Natural Park.

In Portugal a few hundred pairs of griffons nest, but their distribution is strongly asymmetric. The main areas of reproduction are located in Douro International Natural Park, which is home to more than half of the Portuguese population. Though permanently resident in the interior of the country, the griffon vulture often ventures west when the breeding season is over and can occasionally reach the Tagus Estuary and Cape St. Vincent.
The Pyrenees population has apparently been affected by a European Commission ruling that due to danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmission, no carcasses must be left on the fields for the time being. This has critically lowered food availability, and consequently, carrying capacity. Although the griffon vulture does not normally attack larger living prey, there are reports of Spanish griffon vultures killing weak, young or unhealthy living animals when they do not find enough carrion . In May 2013, a 52-year-old woman who was hiking in the Pyrenees died after falling off a cliff. Eurasian griffon vultures devoured her corpse before rescue workers arrived and found only her clothes and a few bones.The story attracted attention to griffon vulture problems in Southern Europe.

In Armenia there are 46-54 pairs according to last estimation of population; the trend demonstrates slight increasing.
In Russia, nests on the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Like other vultures, it is a scavenger, feeding mostly from carcasses of dead animals which it finds by soaring over open areas, often moving in flocks. It grunts and hisses at roosts or when feeding on carrion.

The maximum recorded lifespan of the griffon vulture is 41.4 years for an individual in captivity.

It breeds on crags in mountains in southern Europe, north Africa, and Asia, laying one egg. Griffon vultures may form loose colonies. The population is mostly resident. Density Dependence in this colonial species has been shown to affect annual reproductive success with eyries in protected location (caves, potholes and sheltered ledges) producing more fledglings, and used preferentially, than low-quality eyries (exposed ledges and open crevices), which were only used when the number of breeding individuals increased.

=== Physiology ===

Griffon vultures have been used as model organisms for the study of soaring and thermoregulation. The energy costs of level flight tend to be high, prompting alternatives to flapping in larger birds. Vultures in particular utilize more efficient flying methods such as soaring. Compared to other birds, which elevate their metabolic rate to upwards of 16 times their basal metabolic rate in flight, soaring griffon vultures expend about 1.43 times their basal metabolic rate in flight. Griffon vultures are also efficient flyers in their ability to return to a resting heart rate after flight within ten minutes.

As large scavengers, griffon vultures have not been observed to seek shelter for thermoregulation. Vultures use their bald heads as a means to thermoregulate in both extreme cold and hot temperatures. Changes in posture can increase bare skin exposure from 7% to 32%. This change allows for the more than doubling of convective heat loss in still air. Griffon vultures have also been found to tolerate increased body temperatures as a response to high ambient temperatures. By allowing their internal body temperature to change independently of their metabolic rate, griffon vultures minimize their loss of water and energy in thermoregulating. One study in particular (Bahat 1995) found that these adaptations have allowed the Griffon vulture to have one of the widest thermal neutral zones of any bird.

===Intraspecific competition===
Griffon vultures have shown no age difference in their feeding rates. Feeding rates do tend to increase when more food is available. Studies connected with reintroduction of the vultures have found that older adults are more inclined to display aggressive behaviour and signs of dominance. The sexes have shown no difference in competitive behaviours. Reintroduced and wild-bred birds did not differ in dominance or feeding rate despite their differences in upbringing.

== Threats ==
The main cause of the rapid decline in the griffon vulture population is the consumption of poisoned baits set out by people. Wildlife conservation efforts have attempted to increase awareness of the lethal consequences of using illegally poisoned baits through education about the issue.

<doc id="186694" wikidata="Q130171" url="?curid=186694" title="World Championship Wrestling">
<text>World Championship Wrestling (WCW) was an American professional wrestling promotion founded by Ted Turner in 1988, after Turner Broadcasting System, through a subsidiary named Universal Wrestling Corporation, purchased the assets of National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territory Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) (which had aired its programming on TBS).

For all of its existence, WCW was one of the two top professional wrestling promotions in the United States alongside the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), at one point surpassing the latter in terms of popularity. After initial success through utilization of established wrestling stars of the 1980s, the company appointed Eric Bischoff to executive producer of television in 1993. Under Bischoff&#x27;s leadership, the company enjoyed a period of mainstream success characterized by a shift to reality-based storylines, and notable hirings of former WWF talent. WCW also gained attention for developing a popular cruiserweight division, which showcased an acrobatic, fast-paced, &quot;lucha libre&quot;-inspired style of wrestling. In 1995, WCW debuted their live flagship television program &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, and subsequently developed a ratings competition against the flagship program of the WWF, &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, in a period now known as the Monday Night War. From 1996 to 1998, WCW surpassed their rival program in the ratings for 83 consecutive weeks.

Beginning in 1999, WCW endured significant losses in ratings and revenue due to creative missteps and suffered from the fallout from the 2001 merger of America Online (AOL) and Turner Broadcasting parent Time Warner (later WarnerMedia, now known as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD)). Soon thereafter, WCW was shut down, and the WWF purchased select WCW assets in 2001, including its video library, intellectual property (including the WCW name and championships), and some wrestler contracts. The corporate subsidiary, which was retained to deal with legal obligations and reverted to the Universal Wrestling Corporation name, officially became defunct in 2017. Its headquarters were located in Smyrna, Georgia.

== History ==
=== 1982 to 1993: Origins, creation, and NWA membership ===
&quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot; was a television show produced by Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) since 1982. Jim Barnett (who had briefly owned the Australian promotion of that name) came to Atlanta in the 1970s during an internal struggle for control of GCW. Barnett ultimately became majority owner of the promotion, and began using his previous promotion&#x27;s name for GCW&#x27;s weekly Saturday television program in 1982. Following the events that became known as Black Saturday, in which GCW and its television program briefly came under the ownership of the WWF, the promotion was eventually purchased by Charlotte, North Carolina–based Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), the promoter of the Mid-Atlantic territory immediately north of Georgia.

Influential wrestling magazine &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; and its sister publications thereafter habitually referred to JCP as &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot;, &quot;WCW&quot; and most commonly &quot;the World Championship area&quot; and continued to do so until early 1988 when it began referring to the company solely as the NWA, reasoning that &quot;it has become apparent that the NWA and the World Championship area are one and the same.&quot;

By late 1988, JCP was financially struggling after further territory acquisitions. Ted Turner, the namesake principal owner of Turner Broadcasting System, formed a new subsidiary in October 1988 to acquire most of the assets of JCP. The acquisition was completed on November 2, 1988. While initially the subsidiary was incorporated as the &quot;Universal Wrestling Corporation&quot;, following the purchase the decision was made to utilize the familiar &quot;World Championship Wrestling&quot; as the name for the promotion.

In late Summer/early Autumn 1993, a behind-the-scenes dispute between WCW and the NWA Board of Directors over who had the right to authorize NWA World Heavyweight Championship title changes ultimately resulted in WCW formally withdrawing from the NWA and becoming a standalone wrestling promotion.

=== 1993 to 1996: Eric Bischoff takes charge; launch of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; ===
In February 1993 former commentator Eric Bischoff was appointed as Executive Producer of WCW, and by 1994 he had been promoted once again to Senior Vice President, a position which gave Bischoff both creative and financial control of WCW. At this point, the promotion was struggling financially and was widely perceived within the wrestling industry to be at a low ebb. To counter this, Bischoff felt that WCW was in need of radical reform; to this end, Bischoff sought to modernise WCW and move its image away from that of a Southern-based &quot;rasslin&quot; company. To achieve this, Bischoff increased WCW&#x27;s production values, avoided unprofitable house shows, increased the number of WCW pay-per-views (PPVs, which were profitable), decreased the number of Southern accents on commentary, and began recruiting top stars away from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). This led to marquee names such as Hulk Hogan and &quot;The Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage joining WCW&#x27;s ranks and helping to supplement its business.

In 1995, during a face-to-face meeting with Ted Turner, Bischoff was able to convince Turner that in order for WCW to become competitive with the WWF, WCW would require an equivalent to WWF&#x27;s new flagship cable show &quot;WWF Raw&quot;, which aired on the USA Network. The meeting led to Turner greenlighting the creation of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, which would air on TNT on the same day and in the same time slot as &quot;Raw&quot;. Nitro would debut on September 4, 1995, and directly lead into the Monday Night War era of professional wrestling, in which &quot;WCW Nitro&quot; and &quot;WWF Raw&quot; would fiercely compete to beat each other in the Nielson ratings each and every week. The struggle between the two promotions, each one attempting to produce the best television show possible each week, led to an explosion in the popularity of professional wrestling in the United States and in hindsight is widely considered a golden era.

=== 1996 to 1998: WCW&#x27;s exponential growth; &quot;Nitro&quot; defeats &quot;Raw&quot; for 83 weeks ===

&quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; proved a success for the company, which was immediately able to create a television audience of an equivalent size to &quot;WWF Raw&quot;. Between September 1995 and May 1996, &quot;Nitro&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot; regularly traded victories in the battle for the largest television audience. However, in June 1996, &quot;Nitro&quot; would begin a streak of 83 constructive victories over &quot;Raw&quot;, initially sparked by the start of the New World Order (nWo) storyline. The start of the nWo angle saw former WWF talent Scott Hall and Kevin Nash unexpectedly leave the WWF to come to &quot;Monday Nitro&quot; on consecutive episodes, and each time insinuate that they were there on behalf of the WWF to fight a proxy war. They also alleged that they would soon be joined by a third major figure; this &quot;third man&quot; was eventually revealed to be Hulk Hogan at Bash at the Beach 1996. A major advantage &quot;WCW Nitro&quot; initially had over &quot;WWF Raw&quot; was that Nitro was live-to-air every week, while &quot;Raw&quot; alternated between live episodes and ones taped in advance and aired the following week. &quot;Nitro&quot;″s live atmosphere enhanced segments such as the Hall and Nash debuts as it gave the show an unscripted, &quot;anything can happen at any time&quot; feeling to the television audience.

The start of the nWo angle, which immediately proved immensely popular and intriguing to wrestling fans, was part of a wider shift in the WCW presentation still being pursued by Eric Bischoff. As part of his overhaul of WCW, Bischoff wanted to grow WCW&#x27;s audience amongst 18 to 35-year-olds. To that end, he alongside WCW&#x27;s booker Kevin Sullivan began grounding WCW characters and storylines more in reality, utilising real names and darker themes in contrast to the more cartoon-like presentation which had dominated wrestling in the 1980s and early 1990s. An example of this shift in tone was seen in the transformation of top WCW star Sting over the course of 1996 following the start of the nWo angle, whose persona shifted from a colorful and cheerful clean-cut face to a dark, depressed and brooding antihero inspired by the 1994 film &quot;The Crow&quot;. Another major innovation occurring concurrently in WCW was the introduction of the Cruiserweight division, which saw the introduction of smaller, more agile and more athletic wrestlers performing fast-paced, high-flying dangerous matches on WCW shows. This added another unique element to WCW shows that helped propel their surging popularity.

The combination of a more adult-orientated presentation, live and unedited television, more reality-based storylines, new top-level talent, new and intriguing characters, and more varied in-ring action saw WCW&#x27;s fortunes dramatically shift; the company went from struggling financially as late as 1995 to generating $55 million in profit in 1998. December 1997&#x27;s Starrcade pay-per-view (PPV) event became the highest-grossing PPV of all time for the company, thanks in large part to the show being billed as the culmination of a year-and-a-half feud between Sting and &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan.

=== 1998 to 2001: Leadership changes; collapse and eventual demise ===
1996 and 1997 had been banner years for WCW, with profits and popularity soaring. 1998 saw profits continue to rise. However, maintaining the quality of the shows became difficult, particularly after WCW&#x27;s owners Time Warner Entertainment (who bought Turner Broadcasting System in 1996) ordered the creation of a second live cable WCW program &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;, to air on Thursdays on TBS Superstation starting on January 8, 1998, as well as ordering a third hour to be added to &quot;Nitro&quot;″s runtime. Nonetheless, the creation of new major headline babyface stars such as Diamond Dallas Page and Goldberg were causes for optimism, making the company initially less dependent on the nWo storyline for ratings. However, beginning in Spring 1998, WCW began an angle which saw the nWo split into a heel faction, nWo Hollywood (centered around &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan), and the rival face nWo Wolfpac (consisting of stars such as Kevin Nash, Randy Savage, Sting, Lex Luger and Konnan). Speaking in hindsight in 2023, Eric Bischoff has said the angle was rushed, ill-conceived and had no long-term direction. By this point, many critics began to argue that WCW was now completely overreliant on the nWo storyline and unable to pivot to a new grand concept. Additionally, beginning in the summer of 1998, Bischoff has claimed that Time Warner Entertainment management began to increasingly micromanage WCW and meddle in its presentation. Executives at Time Warner Entertainment began to increasingly advocate that WCW should pivot to more a &quot;family-friendly&quot; orientation, and drop the reforms that turned around the company&#x27;s fortunes.

Concurrently to WCW beginning to struggle under the weight of its own momentum, the WWF began to turn the corner on its own reforms. Having been caught flatfooted by the total reconfiguration of WCW and the success of &quot;Nitro&quot; in 1996 and 1997, by 1998 the WWF was building its own momentum. Taking most of the innovations WCW had implemented and reapplying them to their own presentation, WWF began its &quot;Attitude Era&quot;. Building around newly emerging stars such as Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, as well as WWF promoter Vince McMahon becoming a major on-screen character himself, the WWF finally ended &quot;Nitro&quot;″s 83 weeks of ratings victories on April 13, 1998. For the next four months, &quot;Nitro&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot; would trade wins until October 26, 1998, when &quot;Nitro&quot; scored its last-ever ratings victory over &quot;Raw&quot;. The combined pressure of the WWF seizing back the ratings lead as well as WCW&#x27;s own internal problem caused tension amongst both the on-screen talent and management.

By November 1998 Kevin Nash had become head booker of WCW, overseeing the creative direction of both &quot;Nitro&quot; and &quot;Thunder&quot;. Nash&#x27;s tenure was fraught with unpopular decisions, such as the move that saw the popular undefeated streak of WCW Champion Goldberg ended by Nash himself, who then became champion, only for Nash to then lay down for Hollywood Hogan and reform a reunited nWo in the widely panned &quot;Fingerpoke of Doom&quot; angle.

==== Bischoff removed from power; Vince Russo and Ed Ferrera arrive ====

By September 1999, the rapidly declining ratings of &quot;Nitro&quot; (now half that of &quot;Raw&quot;), drastic dropoff in revenue, and the increasing antagonism between Eric Bischoff and Time Warner executives prompted the head of Turner Sports, Harvey Schiller, to relieve Bischoff of his position. Almost immediately Schiller found a duo to replace Bischoff: former head writers for &quot;Raw&quot; Vince Russo and Ed Ferrera. Russo had just weeks prior walked off the job at the WWF after a dispute with Vince McMahon over work hours, and Ed Ferrera soon followed. Russo and Ferrera were heralded at the time as the main drivers in the turnaround at WWF over the previous two years with their writing philosophy of &quot;Crash TV&quot;, a presentation style that emphasized Soap opera style storylines, lengthier non-wrestling segments, frequent heel/face turns, an increased amount of female representation on the show, expanded storyline depth, frequent title changes, and a greater focus on developing mid-card talent.

The tenure of Russo and Ferrera at the creative helm of WCW was short-lived; by March 2000 the pair had been suspended from their positions as their provocative and edgy angles caused constant protest from AOL Time Warner executives. AOL and Time Warner had merged in January 2000 and, according to Bischoff and Russo, headquarters′ eagerness to tone down WCW had only grown more intense because of this.

Mounting frustrations amongst the talent resulted in many leaving WCW for the WWF; The Giant and Chris Jericho were the first major talent to &quot;jump&quot; to the WWF in 1999, but they were soon followed by many others. Chris Benoit (WCW World Champion at the time), Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn, who performed together on WCW television as &quot;The Revolution&quot;, all collectively walked out of WCW and over to the WWF in January 2000, an incident which resulted in a number of firings amongst WCW management. With shakeups to WCW management becoming more and more frequent, the WCW talent began to lose any sense of leadership or direction, which in turn caused them to form bickering political cliques amongst themselves.

==== Bischoff and Russo collaboration ====

In April 2000, WCW attempted to resolve its creative issues by asking Eric Bischoff to return but work alongside Vince Russo as a duo. The pairing was not cohesive and frequently chafed over the direction of the company. Creatively, the year 2000 saw WCW attempt numerous publicity stunts to gain traction, such as making actor David Arquette (who then had no professional wrestling experience) the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. These moves only served to push traditional wrestling fans away from WCW. Events such as Goldberg forcing WCW World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart into retirement following a botched move at Starrcade 1999, followed just days later by Goldberg very seriously injuring himself during an angle on &quot;Thunder&quot;, and Hollywood Hogan seemingly quitting the company live on PPV at Bash at the Beach 2000 only seemed to further a sense that the company was spiralling out of control. By July 2000 Bischoff had walked off the job.

=== 2001: Sale to the World Wrestling Federation ===
In 2000, several potential buyers for WCW were rumored to show interest in the company. Ted Turner, however, did not hold influence over Time Warner before the final merger of America Online (AOL) and Time Warner in 2001, and most offers were rejected. Eric Bischoff, working with Fusient Media Ventures, made a bid to acquire the company in January 2001. One of the primary backers in the WCW deal backed out after AOL Time Warner refused to allow WCW to continue airing on its networks, leaving Fusient to take that offer off the table while it attempted to bring a new deal around.

In the meantime, Jamie Kellner was handed control over the Turner Broadcasting division in 2000, eventually succeeding Ted Turner on March 7, 2001. Along with AOL Time Warner, Kellner deemed WCW, along with Turner Sports as a whole, to be out of line with its image and saying that it &quot;would not be favorable enough to get the &#x27;right&#x27; advertisers to buy airtime&quot; (even though &quot;Thunder&quot; was the highest-rated show on TBS at the time). As a result, WCW programming was cancelled on TBS and TNT. Another factor in Kellner&#x27;s decision to cancel all WCW programming was the terms of the company&#x27;s purchase deal with Fusient, which included giving Fusient control over time slots on TNT and TBS even if those slots did not air WCW programming. WCW&#x27;s losses were then written off via purchase accounting.

The cancellation of WCW programming left the WWF free to acquire the key assets of WCW through its new subsidiary W. Acquisition Company, which was renamed WCW Inc. afterwards. AOL Time Warner sold the rights to the World Championship Wrestling name, branding, championships, and all other remaining assets aside from the talent roster and video library to WWF for $2.5 million in March 2001. Shortly afterwards WWF paid an additional $1.8 million to cover costs to AOL Time Warner in the negotiations, bringing the final tally of WCW&#x27;s sale to $4.3 million. AOL Time Warner maintained its subsidiary, which reverted to its original legal name of Universal Wrestling Corporation, to deal with legal obligations and liabilities not acquired by the WWF. The UWC was listed as a subsidiary of Time Warner until 2017, when it was merged into Turner Broadcasting System.

Some of the WCW wrestlers joined the WWE immediately and participated in The Invasion storyline as part of The Alliance which lasted until the end of 2001, however many of WCW&#x27;s top stars had contracts with AOL Time Warner rather than WCW itself that the WWF did not acquire, and most choose to sit out the length of their contracts rather than breaking them in order to work for the WWF. Most would eventually find their way to WWE, although Sting remained a notable exception for almost a decade and a half. After the Invasion storyline concluded, the WWF divided the roster into two brands which was originally intended to revive WCW under the WWF umbrella but was instead divided into Raw and SmackDown! brands, named after two WWF&#x27;s top programs at the time.

Many other WCW wrestlers moved to the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA), XWF, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and Ring of Honor which were all formed after the end of WCW.
== Features ==
=== Cruiserweight division ===

In the spring of 1996, WCW introduced its &quot;Cruiserweight division&quot;, a segmented portion of the roster featuring smaller, faster and more agile wrestlers that contrasted starkly, both visually and stylistically, with their heavyweight counterparts. Although weight categories were not a new concept in wrestling or even WCW, the WCW Cruiserweight Division was quickly able to form a unique and popular identity by integrating and mixing wrestlers from all around the world and from vastly different wrestling styles, particularly Mexican &quot;luchadores&quot; such as Rey Misterio Jr., Psicosis, and Juventud Guerrera, but also Japanese &quot;Super Juniors&quot; such as Último Dragón. North American wrestlers, such as Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko and Chris Benoit, who had travelled abroad to Mexico and Japan earlier in their careers and learned the local styles were also able to thrive in the division. The division as a whole became a showcase of a fast-paced, aerial and athletic style of wrestling which became highly influential in both the short and long term in the industry. Eric Bischoff has credited with the division as becoming a defining feature of Monday Nitro that was as fundamental to the late 1990s popularity of WCW as the New World Order faction: 

The Cruiserweight division would continue to directly influence North American wrestling for many decades. Following the acquisition of WCW by WWF/WWE in 2001, WWE revived the Cruiserweight division in 2002 to be a feature of its Smackdown brand, with the WWE Cruiserweight Championship being deemed by the promotion to be the direct lineal successor to the WCW title. Simultaneously, the newly formed Total Nonstop Action wrestling promotion heavily featured their X Division, which did not limit participants by weight but rather by style. Nonetheless, the X-Division was considered a direct spiritual successor to the style developed in the WCW Cruiserweight division and became influential in its own right. WWE and TNA/Impact have continued to experiment and use the Cruiserweight/X-Division concept on and off throughout the 2000s and 2010s and into the 2020s.

== Legacy ==

WCW was extremely influential within professional wrestling in the 1990s and several elements innovated and introduced by WCW would continue to be used in professional wrestling decades after its closure.

=== Short-term legacy ===

In the immediate aftermath of WWF&#x27;s purchase of WCW, a significant portion of WCW&#x27;s active roster was integrated into the WWF. These former WCW talents would be used as part of a &quot;WCW vs WWF&quot; storyline that ran in the WWF throughout 2001. The storyline began proper at the WWF Invasion pay-per-view, which received 775,000 buys and became one of the highest-grossing wrestling pay-per-views of all time. Although WWF was able to recruit many of those on the WCW roster at the time of the purchase, it was unable to secure the use of most of its top-level stars, as they were signed to long-term contracts with AOL-Time Warner rather than WCW. As such, these stars could remain inactive but still continue to be paid, and were not incentivized to join WWF until those contracts expired. It would not be until 2002 onwards that headline WCW stars such as Goldberg or Scott Steiner would join the company. At the No Way Out pay-per-view in February 2002, WWE began their own version of the new World order centered around Hogan, Nash and Hall, but later incorporating former WCW stars the Giant (now known as the Big Show) and Booker T as well as WWE talent such as Shawn Michaels.

Throughout the early 2000s, many former WCW headliners found it difficult to integrate into WWE, as there continued to be legitimate tensions between the two groups. Former WCW performers such as Diamond Dallas Page (who had accepted a WWF contract in 2001) were perceived to be intentionally poorly used as part of a &quot;victory lap&quot; by WWF. In turn, this dissuaded some WCW stars from trusting WWE; for example, Sting choose to remain out of WWE until 2014, and even when he did join, WWE was criticised using Sting to perform yet another victory lap at WrestleMania 31.

After the closure of WCW, several new professional wrestling promotions would launch featuring former talent associated with WCW. The most prominent of these, Total Nonstop Action (TNA), was founded by Jeff Jarrett in 2002 and would attempt to take over WCW&#x27;s market position in the mid-to-late 2000s using some former WCW stars such as Sting. TNA would also adopt their own version of the Cruiserweight division, branded as the X Division.

=== Long-term legacy ===
Throughout the 2000s, WWE would incorporate elements into their shows formerly associated with WCW. Former WCW Championships such as the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, the WCW United States Championship and the WCW Cruiserweight Championship would be reactivated in WWE, with their WCW lineages acknowledged. The Cruiserweight division concept was introduced to WWE in 2002 and since then has been used intermittently throughout the 2000s, 2010s and 2020s from 2002 onwards. Some WCW mainstays such as Booker T, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho were able to achieve long-term top positions within WWE by the mid to late 2000s. Similarly, promotions such as Total Nonstop Action would also make use of former WCW talent when possible and also continued the legacy of the Cruiserweight with their X-Division.

WWE has since released various WCW documentaries, anthologies, and compilations, including &quot;The Rise and Fall of WCW&quot;, and a three volume series hosted by Diamond Dallas Page called &quot;The Very Best of WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. WCW&#x27;s library content would be made available with the launch of WWE Network in 2014.

WWE would revive several of WCW&#x27;s events, including Great American Bash in 2004, Starrcade in 2017 and Halloween Havoc in 2020. WWE also utilized the Night of Champions name and theme used on the last episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; beginning in 2001, which was later known as Clash of Champions, similarly named from WCW&#x27;s Clash of the Champions. In 2017, WWE held its first annual NXT WarGames event for its NXT brand, with that&#x27;s year&#x27;s event featuring the first WarGames match since the September 4, 2000, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;.

In 2019, new promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) formed a partnership with WarnerMedia to air their flagship show, &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;, on TNT, returning professional wrestling to the network for the first time since WCW&#x27;s closure. On January 5, 2022, &quot;Dynamite&quot; moved to TNT&#x27;s sibling network, TBS, marking the first time TBS has aired wrestling programming since the March 21, 2001, episode of &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;. TNT has also broadcast AEW&#x27;s second show, &quot;AEW Rampage&quot;, since August 13, 2021, and added another AEW show with the June 17, 2023, debut of &quot;AEW Collision&quot;.

In 2020, AEW revived WCW&#x27;s Bash at the Beach series of shows with AEW Bash at the Beach on January 15, 2020. However, a lawsuit by WWE prevented further reuse of that branding. Beginning in 2021, AEW began presenting their own version of WCW&#x27;s WarGames match, held at the AEW Blood &amp; Guts event.

&quot;Who Killed WCW?&quot;, a four-part documentary series based on the downfall of WCW premiered June 6, 2024 on Vice TV. The series was presented by Dwayne Johnson and featured former WCW personalities including Bill Goldberg, Eric Bischoff, Bret Hart, Booker T, Kevin Nash, amongst others.

From 2000 to 2001, Monster Jam had a series of monster trucks based on wrestlers&#x27; names. These included the nWo, Sting, Nitro Machine, Madusa and Goldberg. Following the end of WCW, Debrah Miceli, the only one of the truck&#x27;s namesakes to actually drive them, remained in monster trucks. The legacy of the other trucks is most prominent with Goldberg. Driven by to great success by Tom Meents (including Monster Jam World Finals championships both years the truck ran), after the end of the sponsorship Meents continued to run the truck as &quot;Team Meents&quot; in 2002 before debuting its new name Maximum Destruction in 2003. Max-D continues to compete in the series and rivals the legendary Grave Digger in popularity on the circuit.

WCW also had a presence in NASCAR from the mid-1990s to 2000, sponsoring the #29 team in the Busch Grand National Series full-time and the #9 Melling Racing team in the Winston Cup Series part-time. In 1996, Kyle Petty&#x27;s #49 car in the Busch Grand National series was sponsored by the nWo, and Greg Sacks briefly drove a WCW-sponsored for Galaxy Motorsports.

Several WCW video games were made in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, including &quot;WCW Wrestling&quot;, &quot;WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling&quot;, &quot;WCW vs. the World&quot;, WCW vs. nWo: World Tour, WCW/nWo Revenge and &quot;WCW Mayhem&quot;.

<text>The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is an obsolete method for implementing virtual private networks. PPTP has many well known security issues.

PPTP uses a TCP control channel and a Generic Routing Encapsulation tunnel to encapsulate PPP packets. Many modern VPNs use various forms of UDP for this same functionality. 

The PPTP specification does not describe encryption or authentication features and relies on the Point-to-Point Protocol being tunneled to implement any and all security functionalities. 

The PPTP implementation that ships with the Microsoft Windows product families implements various levels of authentication and encryption natively as standard features of the Windows PPTP stack. The intended use of this protocol is to provide security levels and remote access levels comparable with typical VPN products.

== History ==
A specification for PPTP was published in July 1999 as RFC 2637 and was developed by a vendor consortium formed by Microsoft, Ascend Communications (today part of Nokia), 3Com, and others. 

PPTP has not been proposed nor ratified as a standard by the Internet Engineering Task Force.

==Description==
A PPTP tunnel is instantiated by communication to the peer on TCP port 1723. This TCP connection is then used to initiate and manage a GRE tunnel to the same peer. The PPTP GRE packet format is non standard, including a new &quot;acknowledgement number&quot; field replacing the typical &quot;routing&quot; field in the GRE header. However, as in a normal GRE connection, those modified GRE packets are directly encapsulated into IP packets, and seen as IP protocol number 47. The GRE tunnel is used to carry encapsulated PPP packets, allowing the tunnelling of any protocols that can be carried within PPP, including IP, NetBEUI and IPX.

In the Microsoft implementation, the tunneled PPP traffic can be authenticated with PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP v1/v2 .

==Security==
PPTP has been the subject of many security analyses and serious security vulnerabilities have been found in the protocol. The known vulnerabilities relate to the underlying PPP authentication protocols used, the design of the MPPE protocol as well as the integration between MPPE and PPP authentication for session key establishment.

A summary of these vulnerabilities is below:

* MS-CHAP-v1 is fundamentally insecure. Tools exist to trivially extract the NT Password hashes from a captured MSCHAP-v1 exchange.
* When using MS-CHAP-v1, MPPE uses the same RC4 session key for encryption in both directions of the communication flow. This can be cryptanalysed with standard methods by XORing the streams from each direction together.
* MS-CHAP-v2 is vulnerable to dictionary attacks on the captured challenge response packets. Tools exist to perform this process rapidly.
* In 2012, it was demonstrated that the complexity of a brute-force attack on a MS-CHAP-v2 key is equivalent to a brute-force attack on a single DES key. An online service was also demonstrated which is capable of decrypting a MS-CHAP-v2 MD4 passphrase in 23 hours.
* MPPE uses the RC4 stream cipher for encryption. There is no method for authentication of the ciphertext stream and therefore the ciphertext is vulnerable to a bit-flipping attack. An attacker could modify the stream in transit and adjust single bits to change the output stream without possibility of detection. These bit flips may be detected by the protocols themselves through checksums or other means.

EAP-TLS is seen as the superior authentication choice for PPTP; however, it requires implementation of a public-key infrastructure for both client and server certificates. As such, it may not be a viable authentication option for some remote access installations. Most networks that use PPTP have to apply additional security measures or be deemed completely inappropriate for the modern internet environment. At the same time, doing so means negating the aforementioned benefits of the protocol to some point.

<doc id="186703" wikidata="Q125821" url="?curid=186703" title="George Washington Bridge">
<text>The George Washington Bridge is a double-decked suspension bridge spanning the Hudson River, connecting Fort Lee in Bergen County, New Jersey, with the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It is named after George Washington, a Founding Father of the United States and the country&#x27;s first president. The George Washington Bridge is the world&#x27;s busiest motor vehicle bridge, carrying a traffic volume of over 104million vehicles , and is the world&#x27;s only suspension bridge with 14 vehicular lanes.

The bridge is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, a bi-state government agency that operates infrastructure in the Port of New York and New Jersey. The George Washington Bridge is also informally known as the GW Bridge, the GWB, the GW, or the George, and was known as the Fort Lee Bridge or Hudson River Bridge during construction. The George Washington Bridge measures long, and its main span is long. It was the longest main bridge span in the world from its 1931 opening until the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco opened in 1937.

The George Washington Bridge is an important travel corridor within the New York metropolitan area. It has an upper level that carries four lanes in each direction and a lower level with three lanes in each direction, for a total of 14 lanes of travel. The speed limit on the bridge is . The bridge&#x27;s upper level also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic. Interstate 95 (I-95) and U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1/9, composed of US 1 and US 9) cross the river via the bridge. U.S. Route 46 (US 46), which lies entirely within New Jersey, terminates halfway across the bridge at the state border with New York. At its eastern terminus in New York City, the bridge continues onto the Trans-Manhattan Expressway (part of I-95, connecting to the Cross Bronx Expressway).

The idea of a bridge across the Hudson River was first proposed in 1906, but it was not until 1925 that the state legislatures of New York and New Jersey voted to allow for the planning and construction of such a bridge. Construction on the George Washington Bridge started in September 1927; the bridge was ceremonially dedicated on October 24, 1931, and opened to traffic the next day. The opening of the George Washington Bridge contributed to the development of Bergen County, New Jersey, in which Fort Lee is located. The upper deck was widened from six to eight lanes in 1946. The six-lane lower deck was constructed beneath the existing span from 1959 to 1962 because of increasing traffic.

== Design ==
The George Washington Bridge was designed by chief civil engineer Othmar Ammann, design engineer Allston Dana, and assistant chief engineer Edward W. Stearns, with Cass Gilbert as consulting architect. It connects Fort Lee in Bergen County, New Jersey, with Washington Heights in Manhattan, New York. The bridge&#x27;s construction required of fabricated steel; of wire, stretching ; and of masonry.

=== Decks ===
The bridge carries 14 lanes of traffic, seven in each direction. As such, the George Washington Bridge contains more vehicular lanes than any other suspension bridge and is the world&#x27;s busiest vehicular bridge. The fourteen lanes of the bridge are split unevenly across two levels: the upper level contains eight lanes while the lower level contains six lanes. The upper level opened on October 25, 1931, and is wide. The upper level originally had six lanes, though two more lanes were added in 1946. Although the lower level was part of the original plans for the bridge, it did not open until August 29, 1962. The upper level has a vertical clearance of , and all trucks and other oversize vehicles must use the upper level. Trucks are banned from the lower level, which has a clearance of . All lanes on both levels are wide. Vehicles carrying hazardous materials (HAZMATs) are prohibited on the lower level due to its enclosed nature. HAZMAT-carrying vehicles may use the upper level, provided that they conform to strict guidelines as outlined in the Port Authority&#x27;s &quot;Red Book&quot;.There are two sidewalks on the upper span of the bridge, one on each side. The northern sidewalk was largely closed after the September 11 attacks; it reopened in 2017 while a temporary suicide prevention fence was installed on the southern sidewalk, in preparation for the installation of permanent fences on both sidewalks. Prior to 2023, pedestrians had to traverse a total of 171 steps while using the northern sidewalk. As part of a renovation, the steps were replaced by a ramp, and two viewing platforms were added. , the northern sidewalk is closed at night.

The George Washington Bridge has a total length of , while its main span is long. Accounting for the height of the lower deck, the bridge stretches above mean high water at its center, and above mean high water under the New York anchorage. The bridge&#x27;s main span was the longest main bridge span in the world at the time of its opening in 1931, and was nearly double the of the previous recordholder, the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. It held this title until the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937. Prior to the bridge&#x27;s construction, engineers had believed that a suspension span&#x27;s length was a large indicator of a suspension bridge&#x27;s economic feasibility, but the bridge&#x27;s completion proved that longer suspension bridges were both physically and economically feasible.

The George Washington Bridge&#x27;s total width is . When the upper deck was built, it was only thick without any stiffening trusses on the sides, resulting in a deck weighing and a length-to-thickness ratio of about 350 to 1. At the time of the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s opening, most long suspension spans had stiffening trusses on their sides, and spans generally had a length-to-thickness ratio of 60 to 1, which translated to a weight of and a thickness equivalent to an 11-story building. During the planning process, Ammann designed the deck around the &quot;deflection theory&quot;, an as-yet-unconfirmed assumption that a longer suspension deck did not need to be as stiff in proportion to its length, because the weight of the longer deck itself would provide a counterweight against the deck&#x27;s movement. This had been tested by Leon Moisseiff when he designed the Manhattan Bridge in 1909, though it was less than half the length of the George Washington Bridge. Stiffening trusses were ultimately excluded from the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s design to save money; instead, a system of plate girders was installed under the upper deck. This provided the stiffening that was necessary for the bridge deck, and it was replicated on the lower deck during its construction. The plate-girders underneath each deck, combined with an open-truss design on the bridge&#x27;s side that connected the decks with each other, resulted in an even stiffer span that was able to resist torsional forces.

=== Cables ===
Four -diameter main cables support the bridge deck. Each main cable contained 61 strands, with each strand made of 434 individual wires, for a total of 26,474 wires per main cable, and 105,986 in all. The cables are covered by a sheath of weather-resistant steel. The upper bridge deck is held by vertical suspender wires attached directly to the main cables by saddle connections; the lower deck is supported by girders attached to the upper.

The main cables are anchored in concrete on both sides of the bridge, in a purpose-built anchorage on the New York side and bored and set directly into the cliffs of the Palisades on the New Jersey side. Originally, the end of each cable was supposed to receive one of several ornamental designs, such as a wing, fin, tire, or statue; cost-savings after the start of the Great Depression in 1929 preempted the flourishes.

=== Suspension towers ===
The suspension towers on each side of the river are each tall. They are composed of sections weighing between and contain a combined 475,000 rivets. Each bridge has two archways, one above and one below the decks. The George Washington Bridge is classified as a fracture critical bridge, making it vulnerable to collapse if parts of the towers were to fail, although the towers are located offshore.

The original design called for the towers to be encased in concrete and granite in a Revival style, similar to the Brooklyn Bridge. Additional scrutiny of the proposed bridge&#x27;s engineering found that the steel alone could support the towers, with only a decorative stone facade being retained in the plan. Elevators to carry sightseers to restaurants and observatory proposed decks at the top of each tower were also all pared from the design. Ultimately, even stone facades were postponed in 1929 during the Great Depression due to rising material costs. Even though the steel towers had been left that way for cost reasons, some aesthetic critiques of the bare steel towers were favorable. Several groups, such as the American Institute of Steel Construction, believed that covering the steel framework with masonry would be both misleading and &quot;fundamentally ugly&quot;.

While the exposed steel towers&#x27; design was negatively received by a few critics such as Raymond Hood and William A. Boring, the public reception at the bridge&#x27;s opening was generally positive. The Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier wrote of the towers: &quot;The structure is so pure, so resolute, so regular that here, finally, steel architecture seems to laugh.&quot; Milton MacKaye wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that the George Washington Bridge had established Ammann as &quot;one of the immortals of bridge engineering and design, a genius.&quot; Ammann never incorporated masonry towers in his bridge plans again. He wrote that the &quot;sturdy appearance and well-balanced distribution of steel in the columns and bracing&quot; gave the bridge&#x27;s towers &quot;a good appearance, a neat appearance&quot;. Over time, the exposed steel towers, with their distinctive criss-crossed bracing, became one of the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s most identifiable characteristics.

=== American flag ===
Since 1947 or 1948, the bridge has flown the world&#x27;s largest free-flying American flag on special occasions. Hung inside the arch of the New Jersey tower, it measures long, wide, and . Until 1976, the flag was taken out of a garage in New Jersey and manually erected on national holidays. During the United States&#x27; bicentennial, a mechanical hoisting system was installed, and the flag was stored along the bridge&#x27;s girders when not in use. When weather allows, it is hoisted on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, and Veterans Day. Since 2006, the flag is also flown on September 11 of each year, honoring those lost in the September 11 attacks. On events where the flag is flown, the tower lights are lit from dusk until 11:59 p.m.

== History ==
The bridge sits near the sites of Fort Washington (in New York) and Fort Lee (in New Jersey), which were fortified positions used by General George Washington and his American forces as they attempted to deter the occupation of New York City in 1776 during the American Revolutionary War. Unsuccessful, Washington evacuated Manhattan by ferrying his army between the two forts.

By the end of the 19th century there were more than 200 separate municipalities along the lower Hudson River and the New York Bay, with no unified agency to control commerce or transport in the area and no fixed crossing. The first was proposed in 1888 by civil engineer Gustav Lindenthal, who later became New York City&#x27;s bridge commissioner. The Hudson and Manhattan Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad opened three pairs of tubes under the lower Hudson in the 1900s. The first vehicular crossing across the lower Hudson River, the Holland Tunnel, was opened in 1927, connecting Lower Manhattan with Jersey City.

===Planning===
A vehicular bridge across the Hudson River was being considered as early as 1906, during the planning for the Holland Tunnel. Three possible locations for a suspension bridge were considered in the vicinity of 57th, 110th, and 179th Streets in Manhattan, with others rejected on the grounds of aesthetics, geography, or traffic flows. In 1920, English architect Alfred C. Bossom proposed a double-decker bridge with room for vehicular and railroad traffic near 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan. The same year, Othmar Ammann and Gustav Lindenthal proposed a vehicular and railroad bridge to 57th Street in Manhattan, topped by an office building on the Manhattan end that would have been the world&#x27;s tallest. Lindenthal&#x27;s plan failed because it did not receive permits from the United States Army Corps of Engineers or approval from the city, and because Midtown Manhattan real estate developers and planners opposed the plan. Ammann unsuccessfully attempted to convince Lindenthal to build his bridge elsewhere, without a tower atop the bridge&#x27;s terminus. In January 1924, the New York State Chamber of Commerce voted against the 57th Street location in favor of another upstream. Despite this, Lindenthal proposed that a bridge be built there, and carry 16 railroad tracks and 12 lanes of automotive traffic.

Meanwhile, Ammann became chief engineer of the Port of New York Authority (now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey), which was created in 1921 to oversee commerce and transport along the lower Hudson River and New York Bay. He had disassociated himself from Lindenthal&#x27;s proposal by 1923, conducting his own studies on the feasibility of a bridge from 178th Street in Fort Washington, Manhattan, to Fort Lee in New Jersey. Ammann&#x27;s advocacy for the Fort Washington–Fort Lee bridge gained support from both New Jersey governor George Silzer and New York governor Alfred E. Smith by mid-1923. In May 1924, Colonel Frederick Stuart Greene, the New York Superintendent of Public Works, announced a plan to construct a suspension bridge between Fort Lee and Fort Washington. At that location, both sides were surrounded by steep cliffs (The Palisades on the New Jersey side, and Washington Heights on the New York side). Thus, it was possible to build the bridge without either impeding maritime traffic or requiring lengthy approach ramps from ground level.

A New Jersey state assemblyman introduced a bill for the Hudson River bridge that December. This bill was passed in the New Jersey Assembly in February 1925. After an initial rejection by Silzer, the Assembly made modifications before passing the bill again in March, after which Silzer signed the bill. Around the same time, the New York state legislature was also considering a similar bill. A dispute developed between New York civic groups, who supported the construction of the Hudson River Bridge; and the Parks Conservation Association, who believed that the bridge towers would degrade the quality of Fort Washington Park directly underneath the proposed bridge&#x27;s deck. In late March 1925, the chairman of the Parks Conservation Association noted that the proposed New York state legislation would provide for the actual construction of the bridge, rather than just the planning. Ultimately, the Hudson River bridge bill was passed in the New York state legislature, and Smith approved the bill that April.

In March 1925, Silzer asked Ammann to devise preliminary plans for the Hudson River bridge. Ammann found that the width of the Hudson River decreased by more than when it passed between Fort Lee and Fort Washington. The ledges of Fort Lee and Fort Washington were respectively above mean water level at this point, which was not only ideal geography for a suspension bridge, but also allowed the bridge to be high enough to give sufficient clearance for maritime traffic. However, the differing heights meant that a large cut had to be made through the Fort Lee ledge so that the bridge approach could be built there. The same month, the New Jersey legislature asked for funds for test bores to determine if the geological strata would support the bridge. In response to continuing concerns from park preservationists, Ammann stated that placing the New York suspension tower anywhere else would make the bridge look asymmetrical, which he believed was a worse outcome than placing the tower within the park.

The states conducted a study in mid-1925, which found that the Hudson River bridge would be able to pay for itself in twenty-five years if a 50-cent toll were to be placed on every vehicle. After funding was secured, surveyors began examining feasible sites for the future bridge&#x27;s approaches in August 1925. By law, the New York end of the Hudson River Bridge could only be constructed between 178th and 185th Streets, and the New Jersey end had to be built directly across the river. Geologists made test bores on the New Jersey side to determine if the site was feasible for laying foundations for the bridge. Othmar Ammann was hired as the bridge&#x27;s chief engineer. In Ammann&#x27;s original plans for the bridge, which had been published in March 1925, he had envisioned that the bridge would contain two sidewalks; a roadway that could carry up to 8,000 vehicles per hour; and space for four railroad tracks, in case the two North River railroad tunnels downstream exceeded their train capacity. Cass Gilbert was hired in January 1926 to design architectural elements for the Hudson River bridge, including the suspension towers. The bridge design had yet to be finalized, and its cost could not even be estimated at that point due to the complexity of factors.

Gilbert released preliminary sketches of the Hudson River bridge that March; by then, the architect had decided that the span would be a suspension bridge. The sketch accompanied a feasibility report that Ammann and other engineers presented to the Port of New York Authority, which was to operate the bridge. The central span was to be long, longer than any other suspension bridge in existence at the time, and 200 feet above mean high water. The bridge would initially carry four lanes of vehicular traffic and sidewalk lanes; the plans called for three additional phases of expansion, culminating in an eight-lane bridge deck with four rapid-transit tracks underneath. The span would be supported by two towers, each tall. There would also be space to build a second deck in the future below the main deck. Ammann&#x27;s team also found that the most feasible location for the bridge was at 179th Street in Manhattan (as opposed to 181st or 175th Streets). This was both because the 179th Street location was more aesthetically appealing than the other two locations, and because a 179th Street bridge would be cheaper and shorter in length than a bridge at either of the other streets. At this point in the planning process, the Hudson River bridge&#x27;s estimated cost was $40million or $50million. Because of the proposed bridge&#x27;s length, engineers also had to test the strength of materials, including suspension cables, that were to be used in the span. Ammann&#x27;s research department constructed scale models of various designs for the bridge and tested them in wind tunnels.

By late 1926, one engineer predicted that construction on the Hudson River bridge would start the following summer. In December 1926, the final plans for the bridge were approved by the public and by the War Department. The Port Authority planned to sell off $50million worth of bonds to pay for the bridge, and the initial $20million bond issue was sold that December. Further issues arose when the New Jersey Assembly passed a bill in March 1927, which increased the New Jersey governor&#x27;s power to veto Port Authority contracts. Smith, the New York governor, and Silzer, the now-former New Jersey governor who had been appointed Port Authority chairman, both objected to the bill since the Port Authority had been intended as a bi-state venture. Afterward, the then-current New Jersey governor A. Harry Moore worked with legislators to revise the legislation. The revised law was ultimately not a significant deviation from the Port Authority&#x27;s practice at the time, wherein the Port Authority was already submitting its contracts to New Jersey government for review.

=== Construction ===
The George Washington Bridge&#x27;s construction employed three teams of workers: one each for the New Jersey tower, the New York tower, and the deck. The construction process was relatively safe, although twelve or thirteen workers died during its construction. Of these, three were killed when the foundation for the New Jersey tower flooded; a fourth worker was killed by a blast at the New Jersey anchorage; and the others died because of their own carelessness, according to Port Authority records.

==== First contracts ====

In April 1927, the Port Authority opened the first bids for the construction of the Hudson River bridge. It was specifically seeking bids for the construction of the New Jersey suspension tower&#x27;s foundation. The Manhattan suspension anchorage&#x27;s location was still undecided at this time. A bid for the New Jersey tower was awarded later that month. In May, the Port Authority opened more bids for the construction of the bridge&#x27;s approaches and anchorage on the New Jersey side. Dredging operations on the Hudson River, which would allow large ships to pass underneath the bridge, also started that May. By late August, the Port Authority had started condemning plots of land for the bridge&#x27;s approaches.

Montgomery B. Case, the bridge&#x27;s chief construction engineer, began construction on the Hudson River bridge on September 21, 1927, with groundbreaking ceremonies held at the sites of both future suspension towers. Each tower was to have a base with a perimeter measuring , and descending 80 feet into the riverbed. The riverbed around the towers&#x27; sites was dredged first, and then steel pilings were placed in the riverbed to create a watertight cofferdam. The cofferdams for the bridge were the largest ever built at the time. In early October of that year, the Port Authority received bids for the construction of the bridge deck. There were two main methods being considered for the span&#x27;s construction: the cheaper &quot;wire-cable&quot; method and the more expensive &quot;eyebar&quot; method. The wire-cable method, where the vertical suspender wires are attached directly to the main cables and the deck directly, would require a stiffening truss to support the deck. The eyebar method, where the suspender wires are attached to a chain of eyebars (metal bars with holes in them), would be self-supporting. Ultimately, the Port Authority chose the wire-cable design because of costs, and it awarded the contract for constructing the deck to John A. Roebling Sons&#x27; Company. The corresponding contract for manufacturing the steel was awarded to the . The first serious accident during the bridge&#x27;s construction occurred in December 1927, when three men drowned while working in a caisson on the New Jersey side.

==== Towers and anchorages ====
Bids for the Manhattan suspension tower were advertised in March 1928. At this point, 64% of the total projected worth of construction contracts had been awarded. The piers that provided foundation for the New Jersey suspension tower and approaches were being constructed. The cliffs on both sides of the river were high enough that only minimal bridge approaches were required on either side. The towers&#x27; foundations could reach at most below mean low water, where the foundations would hit a layer of solid rock. In May 1928, builders started drilling a cut through the Palisades on the New Jersey side so that the Hudson River bridge approach could be built. By June 1928, half of the money earned during the previous year&#x27;s $20million bond sale had been spent on construction. By that October, nearly all blasting operations had been completed. The suspension tower on the New Jersey side had been constructed to a height of , and the tower on the New York side was progressing as well. The suspension towers consisted of 13 segments, each of which were almost 50 feet high.

The New York anchorage required of concrete, being freestanding, while the New Jersey anchorage was blasted into the Palisades. By March 1929, the concrete structure of the New York anchorage had been completed, three months ahead of schedule. The anchorage on the New Jersey side, which had been fully bored, consisted of two holes that had been bored 250 feet into the face of the Palisades. On the New Jersey side, of rock had to be blasted out to make way for the New Jersey approach. The suspension towers were nearly complete at the time of the report; only 100 feet of each tower&#x27;s height remained to be built. Anchors were being placed in the two holes that were being drilled for the New Jersey anchorage, and this task was also nearing completion.

In April, the Port Authority acquired the last of the properties that were in the path of the bridge&#x27;s Manhattan approach. Plans for the Manhattan approach were approved by the New York City Board of Estimate around the same time. The approach was to consist of scenic, meandering ramps leading to both Riverside Drive and the Henry Hudson Parkway, which run along the eastern bank of the Hudson River at the bottom of the cliff in Washington Heights. The bridge would also connect to 178th and 179th Streets, at the top of Washington Heights. A third connection would be made to an underground highway running between and parallel to 178th and 179th Streets; this connection would become the 178th–179th Street Tunnels, and would later be replaced by the Trans-Manhattan Expressway. The original plan for the approach to the underground highway stated that the approach would be made using a monumental stone viaduct descending from the span at a 2.2% gradient. The Port Authority started evicting residents in the approach&#x27;s path in October 1929. The same month, the Port Authority sold the final $30million in bonds to pay for the bridge.

The plans for the Hudson River bridge&#x27;s Fort Lee approach were also changed in January 1930. Originally, the bridge would have terminated in a traffic circle, a type of intersection design that was being built around New Jersey during the 1920s and 1930s. However, the revised plans called for a grade-separated highway approach that would connect to a traffic &quot;distributing basin&quot; with ramps to nearby highways. The total cost of land acquisition for the bridge approaches on both sides of the Hudson River exceeded $10million.

==== Cable spinning ====

After the towers were completed, two temporary catwalks were built between the two suspension towers. Then, workers began laying the bridge&#x27;s four main cables, a series of thick cables that stretch between the tops of the two towers and carry what would later become the upper deck. The first strand of the first main cable was hoisted between both towers in July 1929, in a ceremony attended by the governors of both states and the mayors of New York City and Fort Lee. The two temporary catwalks allowed workers to spin the wires for the main cables on-site. The wires for the cables were spun by dozens of reels at a dock near the base of the New York anchorage; each reel contained 30 miles of wire at any given time. A total of 105,986 wires were used in the bridge when it was completed.

By February 1930, the bridge was halfway complete; since construction was two months ahead of schedule, the bridge was scheduled to open in early 1932. A team of 350 men was spinning the wires for each of the main cables, which were 22% complete. In addition, the builders had started ordering steel for the deck. By April, the spinning of the main cables was half complete. The first main cable was completed in late July 1930, and the other three main cables were completed that August, with the laying of the last wire being marked by a ceremony. The spinning of the main cables had taken ten months in total.

After the main cables were laid, workers spun the suspender wires that connected the main cables with the deck. When it was finished, the system of cables would support of the deck&#x27;s weight, though the cables would be strong enough to carry , four times as much weight. The construction of a lower deck for rail usage was postponed, since the start of the Depression meant that there would not be enough railroad traffic to justify the construction of such a deck in the near future.

==== Nearing completion ====

An agreement between the Port of New York Authority and the City of New York, dated July 29, 1930, was formed to convey property and property easements granted in relation to the New York Approach to the then Hudson River Bridge. That month, the Port Authority opened the bidding process for contracts to build the Hudson River bridge&#x27;s approaches on the New York side. These included contracts for the 178th–179th Street Tunnels and the Riverside Drive connection. The tunnel contracts were awarded later that month. In August, the bidding process for the Fort Lee approaches was opened. Bids for the Riverside Drive connection were received the following month.

Prior to and during construction, the bridge was unofficially known as the &quot;Hudson River Bridge&quot; or &quot;Fort Lee Bridge&quot;. The Hudson River Bridge Association started seeking suggestions for the bridge&#x27;s official name in October 1930. Residents of New York and New Jersey were encouraged to send naming choices to the association, which would then forward the suggestions to the Port Authority. According to ballot voting submitted to the Port Authority, the &quot;Hudson River Bridge&quot; name was the most popular choice. The Port Authority preferred the name &quot;George Washington Memorial Bridge&quot;, which had been proposed by a board member, and still others championed the name &quot;Palisades Bridge&quot;. However, the Port Authority formally adopted the &quot;George Washington&quot; name on January 13, 1931, honoring the general and future president&#x27;s evacuation of Manhattan at the bridge&#x27;s location during the Revolutionary War. This was described as potentially confusing, since there was already a &quot;Washington Bridge&quot; connecting 181st Street with the Bronx, directly across Manhattan from the &quot;&quot;George&quot; Washington Bridge&quot; across the Hudson River. Shortly afterward, the Port Authority Board of Commissioners voted to reconsider the renaming of the Hudson River Bridge, stating that it was open to alternate names. Hundreds of naming choices had been submitted by this time. The most popular naming choices were those of Washington, Christopher Columbus, and Hudson River namesake Henry Hudson. The span was again officially named for George Washington in April 1931. This decision was applauded by then-congressman Fiorello La Guardia, who felt that other options &quot;insulted the memory of our first President and encouraged the Reds&quot;.

The system of girders to support the deck was installed throughout 1930, and the last girder was installed in late December 1930. In March 1931, the Port Authority announced that the Hudson River Bridge was set to open later that year, rather than in 1932 as originally planned. At that time, the Port Authority had opened bids for paving the road surface. Later that month, the agency published a report, which stated that the bridge&#x27;s early opening date was attributable to how quickly and efficiently the various materials had been transported. In June 1931, forty bankers became the first people to cross the bridge.

Work was progressing quickly on the bridge approaches in New Jersey, and the New York City government was considering building another bridge between Manhattan and the Bronx (the Alexander Hamilton Bridge) to connect with the George Washington Bridge. Bids for constructing tollbooths and floodlight towers were opened in July 1931.

=== 1930s to mid-1950s ===

The George Washington Bridge was dedicated on October 24, 1931, and the bridge opened to traffic on October 25, 1931, eight months ahead of schedule. The opening ceremony, attended by 30,000 guests, was accompanied by a show from military airplanes, as well as speeches from politicians including Morgan Foster Larson, the governor of New Jersey, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the governor of New York. The first people to cross the George Washington Bridge were reportedly two elementary school students who roller-skated across the bridge from the New York side. Pedestrians were allowed to walk the length of the George Washington Bridge between 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. The bridge was formally opened to traffic the next day. The Port Authority collected tolls for drivers who used the bridge in either direction; as with the Holland Tunnel, the toll was set at 50 cents for passenger cars, with different toll rates for other vehicle types. Pedestrians paid a toll of 10 cents each, which was lowered to 5 cents in 1934. Within the first 24 hours of the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s official opening, 56,312 cars used the span, as well as 100,000 pedestrians (including those who had walked across after the ceremony). The Port Authority reported that 33,540 pedestrians crossed the bridge on the first day, of which 20,000 paid a toll to cross.

During the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s construction, the cost of the bridge was estimated at $75million, and the bridge was expected to carry eight million vehicles and 1.5million pedestrians in its first year. When the George Washington Bridge opened, it was estimated that eight million vehicles would use the bridge in its first year, and that the bridge could ultimately carry 60million vehicles annually after a second deck was added. The bridge&#x27;s final cost was estimated at $60million. Real-estate speculators believed that the bridge&#x27;s construction would raise real-estate values in Fort Lee, since the borough&#x27;s residents would be able to more easily access New York City. During the construction of the George Washington Bridge, speculators spent millions of dollars to buy land around the bridge&#x27;s New Jersey approach. The bridge was later credited with helping raise land prices and encouraging residential development in formerly agricultural parts of Bergen County. It also spurred the rise of the trucking industry along the United States&#x27; East Coast, supplanting much of the freight railroads that used to carry cargo. In the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s first week of operation, the bridge carried 116,265 vehicles, compared to the Holland Tunnel&#x27;s 173,010 vehicles, despite the fact that the tunnel had fewer lanes than the bridge did. During that time span, 56,000 pedestrians used the bridge. A week after the bridge opened, the 10-lane tollbooth was expanded to 14 lanes because of heavy weekend traffic volumes. During its first year, the George Washington Bridge saw 5.5million vehicular crossings and nearly 500,000 pedestrian crossings. Traffic counts on the George Washington Bridge grew year after year. By the time of the bridge&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 1941, the span had been used by 72million vehicles total, including a record 9.1million vehicles in 1940.

On February 22, 1932, George Washington&#x27;s 200th birthday, the Port Authority planted 70 red oak trees along an approach to the bridge. New Jersey Route 4, which connected directly to the bridge&#x27;s western end, opened in July 1932. The 178th–179th Street Tunnels, which connected Amsterdam Avenue on the eastern side of Manhattan to the bridge&#x27;s eastern end on the west side of Manhattan, were supposed to be completed in late 1932. Direct approaches to Riverside Drive and the Hudson River Parkway were completed in 1937, and the tunnels were completed in 1938–1939. A ramp eastward from the bridge and southward to the Harlem River Drive was also completed around this time. The bridge&#x27;s westbound entrance ramp from Fort Washington Avenue, at the top of the cliff on the Manhattan side, opened in April 1939; another approach in New Jersey had opened by July 1939. The corresponding eastbound exit ramp, as well as the 178th Street Tunnel, opened in June 1940, while the 179th Street Tunnel opened in 1950. In May 1935, a court ruled that the New Jersey and New York governments controlled their respective sides of the bridge.

The bridge was initially lit by 200 lights to provide warning to pilots flying at night. The Port Authority enacted a photography ban during World War II in the 1940s. An aviation obstruction light was installed in 1936 as a memorial to Will Rogers. Additionally, from May 1942 to May 1945, the lights on the bridge were shut off at night as a precautionary measure. After the war ended, the lights were turned back on, but the photography ban was upheld. In August 1946, the bridge&#x27;s towers were repainted. The underside of the bridge was also repainted in May of the following year.
Originally, the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s deck consisted of six lanes, with an unpaved center median. In 1946, the median was paved over and two more lanes were created on the upper level, widening it from six lanes to eight lanes. The two center lanes on the upper level served as reversible lanes, which could handle traffic in either direction, depending on which direction had the greater traffic flow.

In November 1950, workers began to tighten the bridge&#x27;s suspender ropes after almost 20 years of being in place; the project was completed by 1951. New ramps onto the Henry Hudson Parkway were opened in late 1953, followed by the ramps with the Palisades Interstate Parkway in December 1954. In addition, the barrier system on the bridge was adjusted in mid-1954, and new navigational signs were added to assist motorists. In 1955, the lighting system on the deck was replaced.

=== Mid 1950s to mid-1960s: lower level and Approach modernization ===
Construction of the lower deck, as well as the construction of a new bus terminal and other highway connections near the bridge, were recommended in a 1955 study that suggested improvements to the New York City area&#x27;s highway system. The lower deck was approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. A Bergen County leader voted against the construction of the lower level in 1956, temporarily delaying construction plans. The New York City Planning Commission approved the George Washington Bridge improvement in June 1957, and the Port Authority allocated funds to the improvement that July. The $183million project included the construction of the lower deck; the George Washington Bridge Expressway, a 12-lane expressway connecting to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge and the Cross Bronx Expressway (later I-95 and US 9); the George Washington Bridge Bus Station above the expressway; and a series of new ramps to and from the Henry Hudson Parkway. On the New Jersey side, two depressed toll plazas, one in each direction, were to be constructed for lower level traffic. Highway connections were also being built on the New Jersey side, including a direct approach from I-95.

Construction of the approaches started in September 1958. Work on the lower level itself started on June 2, 1959, but work was briefly halted later that year because of a lack of steel. By February 1960, construction was underway on the lower level; the supporting steelwork for the future deck had been completed, and the sections for the lower deck were being installed. The George Washington Bridge&#x27;s lower deck would comprise 75 steel slabs; each slab weighed 220 tons and measured wide by feet long, with a thickness of . The construction of the slabs proceeded from either side of the bridge. The right-of-way for the George Washington Bridge Expressway had been almost entirely cleared except for the ventilation buildings for the 178th–179th Street Tunnels. During construct The segments of the lower deck had been laid completely by September 1960, at which point workers started pouring the concrete for the deck&#x27;s roadway, a process that took five weeks. The layer of concrete measured thick. Finally, the deck was paved over with a layer of asphalt.

New ramps to the George Washington Bridge in New Jersey, including from the newly completed I-95, opened in mid-1962. The lower deck was opened to the public on August 29, 1962. The lower level, nicknamed &quot;Martha&quot; after George&#x27;s wife Martha Washington, increased the capacity of the bridge by 75 percent, and simultaneously made the George Washington Bridge the world&#x27;s only 14-lane suspension bridge. In addition to providing extra capacity, the lower level served to stiffen the bridge in high winds; before the lower deck was constructed, the George Washington Bridge was known to swing up to . The George Washington Bridge Bus Station opened on January 17, 1963 and the Alexander Hamilton Bridge opened on January 15, 1963, thus allowing more traffic to use the George Washington Bridge. In the first year after the lower level&#x27;s opening, the expanded bridge had carried 44million vehicles. By comparison, 35.86million vehicles had crossed the bridge in an 11-month period between September 1, 1961 and July 31, 1962. In addition, traffic congestion at the George Washington Bridge was reduced after the lower level opened, and the Port Authority repaired the upper level for the first time in the bridge&#x27;s history.

=== Mid-1960s to 2000s ===
In preparation for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, the addition of lighting on the bridge&#x27;s suspender ropes was completed in April of that year. A fixed median was added to the upper level in 1970; the concrete barrier was destroyed to allow for such. In 1976, the bridge&#x27;s towers were equipped with new mechanics towers to hoist up a American flag automatically, This saved money, increased safety, and reduced congestion, as traffic previously had to stop when this happened.

Deterioration of the upper deck had become noticeable by the late 1950s. By 1970, 25% of it had become filled with potholes. Because of this, in 1977, the Port Authority began a project to replace the deck. The original was removed, and the new deck, which was constructed in prefabricated sections, was placed over it. As part of the project, the upper level was restricted to four lanes; the upper-level lanes carried two-way traffic during off-peak hours. The PANYNJ encouraged traffic to use the lower level due to this. It was completed in October 1978, a few weeks ahead of schedule. It was one the first orthotropic deck replacements in the United States.

The first-ever complete closure of the George Washington Bridge occurred on August 6, 1980, when a truck carrying highly flammable propane gas across the bridge started to leak. As a safety precaution in case the fuel started to ignite, traffic across the bridge was halted for several hours, and 2,000 people living near the bridge were evacuated. Since the George Washington Bridge is the primary crossing between New Jersey and New York City, the closure caused traffic jams that stretched for up to , and the effects of this congestion could be seen more than away. Two police officers eventually plugged the leak with an inexpensive device. Up to that point, trucks carrying flammable material had been allowed to use the George Washington Bridge. After the incident, New York City officials conducted a study on whether to prohibit hazardous cargo from traveling through the city. As a direct result, any truck carrying flammable gas were banned from the lower level.

The bridge was carrying 82.8million vehicles per year by 1980. The American Society of Civil Engineers named the bridge as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark on October 24, 1981, the 50th anniversary of the bridge. The 50th anniversary was also marked with a parade of automobiles. At that point, 1.8billion vehicles had used the bridge throughout its lifetime. A temporary water pipeline was installed on the bridge during a drought; it was ultimately retained. The north sidewalk was rebuilt from November 1983 to late 1985, and the south sidewalk was also reconstructed from February 1984 to early 1986. The project cost $9 million.

Rehabilitation of the upper level&#x27;s expansion joints took place in 1988, and a rehabilitation of the lower level was announced two years later. The supporting structural steel between the two decks were replaced, and some ramps onto the lower level were rebuilt. The ramps on the New York side, connecting with Riverside Drive and the Henry Hudson Parkway, were reconstructed for $27.6million after studies in the late 1980s showed deterioration on these ramps. Although the Port Authority had announced the repairs in advance, the start of roadwork in September 1990 caused extensive traffic jams. The upper level was repaved in 1995, an inspection in 1997 found that 440 vertical suspender ropes at the New York anchorage had corroded, so these were replaced.

=== 2000s to present ===
Workers started rehabilitating about of approach ramps in 1999; the project was finished in May 2001 and cost $38 million. The Port Authority also proposed a ramp from the lower level to the Palisades Interstate Parkway on the New Jersey side in 2000. The ramp would have cost $86.5million and would have been completed in 2003 or 2004, but the connection was ultimately not built. Starting on July 4, 2000, and for subsequent special occasions, each of the George Washington Bridge&#x27;s suspension towers has been illuminated by 380 light fixtures that highlight the exposed steel structure. On each tower are a mix of 150 and 1000 watt metal halide lamp fixtures. The architectural lighting design was completed by Domingo Gonzalez Associates. 

The northern sidewalk was closed after the September 11 attacks because of security concerns. In addition, trucks were banned from the lower level to avoid severe damage from a potential car bombing. In 2002, the Port Authority began to repaint the towers and the underside of the upper deck. The old lead-based paint was replaced with lead-free paint. The $62 million project was completed in September 2006, in advance of the bridge&#x27;s 75th anniversary. In September 2007, the Port Authority announced announced that the suspender lighting was to be replaced by new energy-efficient diodes. This project was completed in 2009.

Following 15 reported suicides and 68 failed suicides in 2017, the Port Authority installed protective netting and an fence along each upper level sidewalk. The netting partially overhangs the sidewalks in order to prevent potential jumpers from scaling the fence directly. The southern sidewalk was closed from September to December 2017 so that a temporary fence could be installed there. Once the temporary fence had been erected, the permanent 11-foot-high barrier was constructed on the northern sidewalk, followed by the permanent barrier on the southern sidewalk.

====2010s renovation====

In December 2011, the Port Authority announced plans to extensively rehabilitate the bridge. The vertical suspender ropes would be replaced, at an expected cost of more than $1billion paid for by toll revenue. In August 2013, repair crews began an $82 million effort to fix cracks in the upper deck&#x27;s structural steel. Work restarted in June 2014 after a pause lasting several months. The Port Authority also started a $2 billion project to renovate or replace bridge components. The lower level was repaved in 2016, and repainting work and maintenance platform replacement on the lower deck was completed in 2017. The bridge&#x27;s 592 vertical suspender ropes were then replaced to fix damage caused by excessive heat and humidity. The staircases leading to the sidewalks on both the northern and southern sides of the upper deck were also being replaced with ramps that were compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Trans-Manhattan Expressway was being renovated in conjunction with this project. On the New Jersey side, the Palisades Interstate Parkway &quot;Helix&quot; ramp onto the bridge would be replaced at a cost of $112.6million; this was completed in March 2019.

The northern sidewalk reopened in early 2023, after the suspender ropes on that side had been replaced. By early 2024, the restoration project was half complete, and workers were restoring the southern sidewalk and its cables. The same year, the Port Authority awarded $455 million in contracts for structural steel replacement. The suspender cable replacements were almost finished by December 2024.

== Road connections ==

=== New Jersey ===
The George Washington Bridge carries I-95 and US 1/9 between New Jersey and New York. Coming from New Jersey, US 46 terminates at the state border in the middle of the bridge. Further west, I-80, US 9W, New Jersey Route 4, and the New Jersey Turnpike also feed into the bridge via either I-95, U.S. 1/9, or U.S. 46 but end before reaching it. I-80 also gives drivers from the Garden State Parkway and Route 17 access to the bridge, and access to them as seen by signage on I-95 south. The Palisades Interstate Parkway connects directly to the bridge&#x27;s upper level, though not to the lower level; however, a ramp to link the Interstate Parkway to the lower level was proposed in 2000. The marginal roads and local streets above the highways are known as GWB Plaza. The bridge&#x27;s toll plaza, which collects tolls from eastbound/northbound traffic only, is located on the New Jersey side.

=== New York ===

On the New York side, the 12-lane Trans-Manhattan Expressway heads east across the narrow neck of Upper Manhattan, from the bridge to the Harlem River. It provides access from both decks to 178th and 179th Streets, which cross Manhattan horizontally, where U.S. 9 leaves the expressway and follows Broadway; the Henry Hudson Parkway and Riverside Drive, on the Hudson River&#x27;s eastern bank along the west side of Manhattan; and to Amsterdam Avenue and the Harlem River Drive, on the Harlem River&#x27;s western bank on the east side. The expressway connects directly with the Alexander Hamilton Bridge, which spans the Harlem River as part of the Cross-Bronx Expressway (I-95), providing access to the Major Deegan Expressway (I-87). Heading towards New Jersey, local access to the bridge is available from 179th Street. There are also ramps connecting the bridge to the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, a commuter bus terminal with direct access to the New York City Subway at the 175th Street station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line (served by the ).

Originally, the approach to the George Washington Bridge from the New York side consisted of a roundabout encircling a fountain, which was designed by Cass Gilbert. This plan was deemed not feasible as a result of the congestion that the weaving movements would create. The final plans called for meandering roadways from Riverside Drive and Henry Hudson Parkway, which run along the eastern bank of the Hudson River at the bottom of the cliff in Washington Heights. The Henry Hudson Parkway actually passes under the New York side&#x27;s anchorage using an underpass designed by Gilbert. The connection to the 178th–179th Street Tunnels, which connected to the southbound Harlem River Drive, opened in 1940. The tunnels were replaced by the Trans-Manhattan Expressway, which opened in 1962. The tunnels and expressway were built to minimize disruption to the Washington Heights neighborhood, which had already been developed at the time.

=== Alternate routes ===

Further south along the Hudson River, the Lincoln Tunnel (Route 495) and Holland Tunnel (Interstate 78/Route 139) also enter Manhattan. Both tunnels are operated by the Port Authority, which collects tolls from drivers crossing the Hudson River eastbound toward New York City. The Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge (I-278), connecting the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn, is the southernmost alternate route. It connects to the Bayonne Bridge, Goethals Bridge, and Outerbridge Crossing between Staten Island and New Jersey. All four bridges to Staten Island collect tolls for drivers driving into the island.

Farther north within the New York metropolitan area, the Tappan Zee Bridge (Interstates 87/287 and New York State Thruway) avoids the congested Cross Bronx Expressway and the city proper. Thruway traffic sometimes uses the George Washington Bridge as a detour, since no roads cross the Hudson River between the George Washington and Tappan Zee bridges. The Tappan Zee Bridge also charges tolls for eastbound drivers. Even farther north is the Bear Mountain Bridge, carrying U.S. 6 and U.S. 202, about north of the Tappan Zee Bridge; it also charges tolls for eastbound drivers.

== Tolls ==

, the tolls-by-mail rate going from New Jersey to New York City is $18.31 for cars and motorcycles; there is no toll for passenger vehicles going from New York City to New Jersey. New Jersey and New York–issued E-ZPass users are charged $14.06 for cars and $13.06 for motorcycles during off-peak hours, and $16.06 for cars and $15.06 for motorcycles during peak hours. Users with E-ZPass issued from agencies outside of New Jersey and New York are charged the tolls-by-mail rate.

Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. The original toll booth on the New Jersey side was designed by Gilbert, who also designed a classical-style maintenance booth, neither of which is extant. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for westbound drivers, and at the same time, eastbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were also changed to south- or eastbound-only at that time. There were a series of tollbooths on the New Jersey side. The bridge had 29 toll lanes: 12 in the main upper-level toll plaza, 10 in the lower-level toll plaza, and seven in the Palisades Interstate Parkway toll plaza leading to the upper level. The toll plazas on the lower level and Palisades Parkway were not staffed during the overnight hours and accepted only E-ZPass transactions during this period. E-ZPass was accepted for toll payment on the George Washington Bridge starting in July 1997. In 2000, the Port Authority proposed removing the tollbooths for the E-ZPass lanes on the lower level and Palisades Parkway toll plazas, replacing them with electronic toll collection gantries to allow motorists to maintain highway speeds.

Pedestrians and cyclists may cross free of charge on the south sidewalk. Pedestrians traveling in either direction originally paid tolls of 10 cents when the bridge opened. The pedestrian toll was reduced to 5 cents in 1935 and discontinued altogether in 1940.

Open road tolling was implemented for drivers going from Palisades Interstate Parkway on February 2, 2020, on the lower level on November 7, 2020, and on the upper level on July 10, 2022. The tollbooths will be dismantled, and drivers will no longer be able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there will be cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries on the New Jersey side going to New York. A vehicle without E-ZPass will have a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll will be mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors will detect their transponders wirelessly. In March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all-electronic tolling was temporarily placed in effect for all Port Authority crossings, including the George Washington Bridge. Cash toll collection was temporarily reinstated on the upper level only from October 2020 to July 2022 while the required open road tolling infrastructure was being installed. The carpool discount was eliminated when open-road tolling commenced on the upper level in July 2022. The toll plazas were demolished starting in March 2023; the removal was expected to take two years.

===Historical toll rates===

Prior to July 10, 2022, a discounted carpool toll ($7.75) was available at all times for cars with three or more passengers using NY or NJ E-ZPass, who proceed through a staffed toll lane (provided they have registered with the free &quot;Carpool Plan&quot;), except if entering from the Palisades Interstate Parkway entrance to the bridge. The Carpool Plan ended when the George Washington Bridge implemented cashless tolling.

== Non-motorized access ==

The George Washington Bridge contains two sidewalks that can be used by pedestrians and bicyclists. The southern sidewalk (accessible by a long, steep ramp on the Manhattan side of the bridge) is shared by cyclists and pedestrians. The entrance in Manhattan is at 178th Street, just west of Cabrini Boulevard, and also has access to the Hudson River Greenway north of the bridge. Both sidewalks are accessible on the New Jersey side from Hudson Terrace. The George Washington Bridge carries New York State Bicycle Route 9, a bike route that runs from New York City north to Rouses Point. , the bike lanes are open from 5 a.m. to midnight every day.

The Port Authority closed the northern sidewalk at all times in 2001. Though it offers direct access into Palisades Interstate Park, the northern sidewalk requires stairway climbs and descents on both sides, which was inaccessible for people with physical disabilities and posed a risk in poor weather conditions. Advocacy groups such as Transportation Alternatives also suggested improvements.

As part of the project to replace the bridge&#x27;s vertical support cables, the connections to both sidewalks will be enhanced or rebuilt and made ADA-compliant. While the south-side cables are being replaced, that sidewalk will be closed and the north sidewalk will be open. Once the entire project is completed in 2027, pedestrians will use the south sidewalk and cyclists will use the north sidewalk. The sidewalk aspect of the project is expected to cost $118million.

=== Suicides and deaths ===

The George Washington Bridge is among the most frequently chosen sites in the New York metropolitan area for suicide by jumping or falling off the bridge. The first death by jumping was unintentional and occurred before the bridge opened. On September 21, 1930, a stunt jumper named Norman J. Terry jumped off the bridge&#x27;s deck in front of a crowd of thousands, and because his body was facing the wrong way, he broke his neck upon hitting the water. The first intentional suicide occurred on November 3, 1931, a little more than one week after the bridge opened.

Several suicide attempts off the George Washington Bridge have been widely publicized. In 1994, a person going by the name &quot;Prince&quot; called &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; while on the bridge, said he would kill himself, but Howard Stern talked him out of it. The 2010 suicide of Tyler Clementi, who had jumped from the bridge, drew national attention to cyberbullying and the struggles facing LGBT youth.

In 2012, a record 18 people threw themselves off the bridge to their deaths, while 43 others attempted to do so but survived. There were 18 deaths reported in both 2014 and 2015. In 2014, 74 people were stopped by the Port Authority police, while the next year, another 86 people were stopped by the Port Authority police. In 2016, there were 12 reported deaths, a decrease from previous years, while 70 people were stopped by the Port Authority police. In 2017, the Port Authority proposed equipping a two-person Emergency Services Unit team with harnesses to prevent suicides from the bridge.

=== Controversies and protests ===
On September 9, 2013, dedicated toll lanes for one of the local Fort Lee entrances to the bridge&#x27;s upper level were reduced from three to one, with the two other lanes diverted to highway traffic. The closures were made without notification to local government officials and emergency responders. The local toll lane reductions caused massive traffic congestion, with major delays for school transportation and police and emergency service responses within Fort Lee. The lanes were reopened by the Port Authority on September 13. After a four-month investigation, it was revealed that the lane closures were made by the aides and appointees of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, causing a political scandal. The repercussions and controversy surrounding these actions have been investigated by the Port Authority, federal prosecutors, and a New Jersey legislature committee.

On September 12, 2020, a hundred anti-police brutality protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement converged from both New York and New Jersey, blocking the upper level of the bridge for about an hour before walking to the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 34th Precinct in Manhattan.

=== Other incidents ===

On December 28, 1966, a 19-year-old pilot made an emergency landing on the bridge&#x27;s New Jersey side after his plane&#x27;s engine failed. There were no deaths reported, because there was very little traffic at the time, but the pilot and his passenger were injured. At the time, there was no median barrier on the bridge&#x27;s upper deck.

In June 1977, two tractor-trailers nearly fell off the lower level after jackknifing, then going through both the roadway barrier and a mesh net next to the roadway. One of the drivers was hurt slightly, while the other driver was not hurt. The accident also involved a third tractor-trailer and two passenger cars, none of whose occupants were hurt. Accidents involving trucks dumping their cargo have also occurred on the George Washington Bridge. Watermelons, frozen chicken parts, and horse manure have all fallen onto the bridge&#x27;s roadway at some point. 

During the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, several news organizations, including CNN, reported that a vehicle filled with explosives had been found on the lower level of the bridge. However, several investigations found no evidence of a vehicle containing explosives on the bridge.

== In popular culture ==
The bridge is seen in a number of movies set in New York:
* &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; (1941) was the first film to show the bridge. 
* In &quot;Force of Evil&quot; (1948), Leo Morse is buried under the bridge by the mob of gangsters employing his brother Joe.
* In &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; (1953), Loco and Brewster are fêted as being in the 50 millionth car to cross the bridge as part of the &quot;George Washington Bridge Week&quot; festivities.
* In &quot;Network&quot; (1976), Schumacher tells a story in which, having overslept for a news shoot about the bridge&#x27;s new lower deck, he gets into a cab wearing a raincoat over his pajamas and tells the driver to take him to the middle of the bridge. The taxi driver, concerned that Schumacher intends to jump, begs him: &quot;Don&#x27;t do it buddy! You&#x27;re a young man!&quot; 
* &quot;Sully&quot; (2016) reenacts how Sullenberger overflew the bridge by a few hundred feet.
* The bridge was also shown in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), and &quot;Cop Land&quot; (1997).

The bridge has been featured in music. In the opening singalong for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Ernie sang the words &quot;George Washington Bridge&quot; to the tune of &quot;Sobre las Olas&quot; (&quot;The Loveliest Night of the Year&quot;). In addition, William Schuman&#x27;s 1950 work &quot;George Washington Bridge.&quot; Nina Rosario sings &quot;Just me and the GWB asking, &#x27;Gee, Nina, what&#x27;ll you be? in &quot;Breathe&quot; from &quot;In the Heights&quot;.

In visual art, the first issue of the comic &quot;Atomic War!&quot; published in November 1952, the George Washington Bridge is shown collapsing during a bombing of New York City. Additionally, painters George Ault and Valeri Larko have both created artworks named after the bridge. Video games such as &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; also showed the George Washington Bridge.

The construction of the bridge is detailed in &quot;George Washington Bridge: A Timeless Marvel&quot; and &quot;George Washington Bridge: Poetry in Steel.&quot; The bridge and the nearby Little Red Lighthouse are the subjects of Hildegarde Swift&#x27;s 1942 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge&quot;.

<text>The Lippe () is a river in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is a right tributary of the Rhine and in length with an elevation difference of 125 metres and a catchment area of 4.890 km².
The source is located at the edge of the Teutoburg Forest in Bad Lippspringe close to the city of Paderborn. It runs westward through Paderborn, Lippstadt and then along the northern edge of the Ruhr area, parallel to the river Emscher and river Ruhr. The river finally enters the Rhine at Wesel.

== Description and history==
The river Lippe has been used as an infrastructure in Roman times. For the Romans the river (named &quot;Lupia&quot;) was a gateway to Germania, running from the river Rhine to the region around Paderborn. The watercourse was used for transport of supplies, so along the banks of the Lippe many former Roman camps could be found. In the last 200 years many of these camps have been identified, above all the camp in Haltern which is likely to be the former headquarter of the imperial prince Tiberius. The distance between the camps is about a one-day walk for the troops, which is almost 30 km (20 mi). Today&#x27;s identified Roman camps are: Olfen, Xanten, Haltern, Oberaden, Holsterhausen, Anreppen and Beckinghausen. The Battle of the Lupia River was fought in 11 BCE between Nero Claudius Drusus and the Sicambri (Sugambri).

Today, the river appears as a two-tier water course: Upstream, eastward of the city of Hamm, the catchment is more rural. Downstream of Hamm settlements and industrial impacts characterize the situation. Though the Lippe was partly navigable from 1820 on it was not sufficient for the transport of industrial goods.

Historically, the preconditions for a change of the landscape started with the construction of the Cologne-Minden trunk line in the 1840s that connected the river Rhine settlements like Cologne with harbours and trade at the river Weser and so with the Lippe town Hamm, too. Moreover, this railway supported the coal and steel industry development in the northern Ruhr region. The hard coal mining that started in the middle of the 19th century in the Emscher catchment area developed in the following decades direction north and so to the Lippe catchment area. From the 1860s onwards the first problems of mining subsidence and drainage of polluted water appeared. The historical city of Hamm and the towns Lünen, Haltern and Dorsten were small settlements located at the Lippe but expanded with the establishment of hard coal mines starting around 1900. The industrialization caused huge water quality problems in the Lippe tributaries and the Lippe itself; therefore first in 1913 the Sesekegenossenschaft and later in 1926 the Lippeverband (“Wasserwirtschaftsverbände”) were established as water boards. Since 1914 the Datteln-Hamm Canal and 1930 the Wesel-Datteln Canal are located in parallel to the Lippe which is not navigable for mass transportation. The canals receive Lippe water or feed the Lippe (to improve dry weather flow) from an exchange facility in Hamm, operated by the Wasserverband Westdeutsche Kanäle.

Until the 1970s water pollution played no important role in the public debate but the environmental policy changed over the decades. Environmental standards on national level and especially from the EU have been leading to enormous efforts to improve the natural standards and today a couple of positive developments can be stated, like new FFH (Flora Fauna Habitat) sites and governmental initiatives around the WFD (Water Framework Directive).

<text>Agricultural productivity is measured as the ratio of agricultural outputs to inputs. While individual products are usually measured by weight, which is known as crop yield, varying products make measuring overall agricultural output difficult. Therefore, agricultural productivity is usually measured as the market value of the final output. This productivity can be compared to many different types of inputs such as labour or land. Such comparisons are called partial measures of productivity.

Agricultural productivity may also be measured by what is termed total factor productivity (TFP). This method of calculating agricultural productivity compares an index of agricultural inputs to an index of outputs. This measure of agricultural productivity was established to remedy the shortcomings of the partial measures of productivity; notably that it is often hard to identify the factors cause them to change. Changes in TFP are usually attributed to technological improvements.

Agricultural productivity is an important component of food security. Increasing agricultural productivity through sustainable practices can be an important way to decrease the amount of land needed for farming and slow environmental degradation and climate change through processes like deforestation.

==Sources of agricultural productivity==

Productivity is driven by changes in either agricultural technique or improvements in technology. Some sources of changes in agricultural productivity have included:
* Mechanization
* High yield varieties, which were the basis of the Green revolution
* Fertilizers: Primary plant nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and secondary nutrients such as sulfur, zinc, copper, manganese, calcium, magnesium and molybdenum on deficient soil
* Education in management and entrepreneurial techniques to decrease fixed and variable costs and optimise manpower
* Liming of acid soils to raise pH and to provide calcium and magnesium
* Irrigation
* Herbicides
* Genetic engineering
* Pesticides
* Increased plant density
* Animal feed made more digestible by processing
* Keeping animals indoors in cold weather

See: Productivity improving technologies (historical) Section: 2.4.1: Mechanization: Agriculture, Section 2.6: Scientific agriculture.

==Impact==
The productivity of a region&#x27;s farms is important for many reasons. Aside from providing more food, increasing the productivity of farms affects the region&#x27;s prospects for growth and competitiveness on the agricultural market, income distribution and savings, and labour migration. An increase in a region&#x27;s agricultural productivity implies a more efficient distribution of scarce resources. As farmers adopt new techniques and differences, the more productive farmers benefit from an increase in their welfare while farmers who are not productive enough will exit the market to seek success elsewhere.

As a region&#x27;s farms become more productive, its comparative advantage in agricultural products increases, which means that it can produce these products at a lower opportunity cost than can other regions. Therefore, the region becomes more competitive on the world market, which means that it can attract more consumers since they are able to buy more of the products offered for the same amount of money. As productivity improvement leads to falling food prices, this automatically leads to increases in real income elsewhere.

Increases in agricultural productivity lead also to agricultural growth and can help to alleviate poverty in poor and developing countries, where agriculture often employs the greatest portion of the population. As farms become more productive, the wages earned by those who work in agriculture increase. At the same time, food prices decrease and food supplies become more stable. Labourers therefore have more money to spend on food as well as other products. This also leads to agricultural growth. People see that there is a greater opportunity to earn their living by farming and are attracted to agriculture either as owners of farms themselves or as labourers. 

It is not only the people employed in agriculture who benefit from increases in agricultural productivity. Those employed in other sectors also enjoy lower food prices and a more stable food supply. Their wages may also increase.

=== Food security ===

Agricultural productivity is becoming increasingly important as the world population continues to grow. As agricultural productivity grows, food prices decrease, allowing people to spend less on food, and combatting hunger. India, one of the world&#x27;s most populous countries, has taken steps in the past decades to increase its land productivity. In the 1960s North India produced only wheat, but with the advent of the earlier maturing high-yielding wheats and rices, the wheat could be harvested in time to plant rice. This wheat/rice combination is now widely used throughout the Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Uttar Pradesh. The wheat yield of three tons and rice yield of two tons combine for five tons of grain per hectare, helping to feed India&#x27;s 1.1 billion people.

Higher global food prices between 2006 and 2008, primarily caused by an increasing amount arable land used for growing biofuels and the growing economies in China and elsewhere causing an increase in demand for meat products (which are less efficient than plants in terms of land use), caused the percentage of incomes used for food to increase throughout the world, forcing families to cut back on various other expenditures such as schooling for girls. In areas of sub-Saharan Africa, a decreased agricultural productivity due to crop failures has caused starvation. On the other hand, higher global prices actually mean farmers with successful yields earn more, and this thus increases their productivity.

Investing in the agricultural productivity of women in farming communities is of particular importance in boosting economic development and food security in parts of the developing world. Women in some areas of the world, for example in Africa, traditionally have less agency than men, but are often also more invested in farming in terms of time spent. They are furthermore generally more responsible for childcare, thus their productivity is more likely to translate in gains for the family as a whole.

=== Relation to population growth ===

Some critics claim that increasing agricultural productivity results in human overpopulation. They are argue that, like other species, human populations grow up to their carrying capacity. When a species reaches its carrying capacity, the number of poor and weak individuals who die from disease or starvation is equal to the number of individuals being added to the population via birth. Because innovation continues to improve agricultural productivity (specifically yields), however, the theoretical carrying capacity continues to increase, allowing the human population to continue to grow. These writers claim that there are too many people on Earth and that therefore growth in agricultural productivity is detrimental to the environment — if the carrying capacity was lower, the human population would reach an equilibrium at a lower number.

However, unlike other animals, in humans greater development and prosperity has led to lower fecundity. Thus as productivity has increased and poverty has been reduced worldwide, population growth is declining. Research suggests we may actually face a declining world population in the future.

==Inverse relationship theory==
Deolalikar in 1981 investigated the theory first proposed by Sen in 1975 that in traditional, pre-modern farming in India, there is an inverse relationship to size of the farm and productivity, contrary to the economy of scale found in all other types of economic activity. It is debated whether the inverse relationship actually exists. Numerous studies falsify this theory. In Zimbabwe, policies on agrarian land reform under president Robert Mugabe, especially in and following 2000, split large farms into many smaller farms, and this decreased productivity. Marxist agrarian land reform in the Soviet Union, China and Vietnam combined small farms into larger units, this usually failed to increase productivity.

Nonetheless, increasing agricultural productivity amongst smallholder farms is an important way to improve farmer livelihoods in the developing world.

==Sustainable increases in productivity==
Because agriculture has such significant impacts on climate change and other environmental issues, intensification of agriculture, which would increase productivity per amount of land being farmed, is seen by some as an essential method for climate change mitigation, because farmers will not require more land, and are thus incentivized not to participate in further land degradation or deforestation. Implementing intensification through sustainable agriculture practices makes farming more sustainable in the long term, maintaining the ability of future generations to meet their own needs while conserving the environment. International policy, embodied in Sustainable Development Goal 2, focuses on improving these practices at a global level.

Not all effects of climate change will negatively affect agricultural productivity. The IPCC &quot;Special Report on Climate Change and Land&quot; and the &quot;Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C&quot; both project mixed changes in the yields of crops as global warming happens with some breadbasket regions becoming less productive, while other crops increase ranges and productivity.

<text>Intercity Express (commonly known as ICE () and running under this category) is a high-speed rail system in Germany. It also serves destinations in Austria, France, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands as part of cross-border services. It is the flagship of the German state railway, Deutsche Bahn. ICE fares are fixed for station-to-station connections, on the grounds that the trains have a higher level of comfort. Travelling at speeds up to within Germany and when in France, they are aimed at business travellers and long-distance commuters and marketed by Deutsche Bahn as an alternative to flights.

The ICE 3 also has been the development base for the Siemens Velaro family of trainsets which has subsequently been exported to RENFE in Spain (AVE Class 103), which are certified to run at speeds up to , as well as versions ordered by China for the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway link (CRH 3) and by Russia for the Moscow–Saint Petersburg and Moscow–Nizhny Novgorod routes (Velaro RUS) with further customers being Eurostar as well as Turkey and Egypt.

== History ==

The Deutsche Bundesbahn started a series of trials in 1985 using the InterCityExperimental (also called ICE-V) test train. The IC Experimental was used as a showcase train and for high-speed trials, setting a new world speed record at 406.9 km/h (253 mph) on 1 May 1988.
The train was retired in 1996 and replaced with a new trial unit, called the ICE S.

After extensive discussion between the Bundesbahn and the Ministry of Transport regarding onboard equipment, length and width of the train and the number of trainsets required, a first batch of 41 units was ordered in 1988. The order was extended to 60 units in 1990, with German reunification in mind. However, not all trains could be delivered in time.

The ICE network was officially inaugurated on 29 May 1991 with several vehicles converging on the newly built station Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe from different directions.

In 2007, a line between Paris and Frankfurt/Stuttgart opened, jointly operated by ICE and SNCF&#x27;s TGV.

=== ICE livery ===
A notable characteristic of the ICE trains is their colour design, which has been registered by the DB as an aesthetic model and hence is protected as intellectual property. The trains are painted in &quot;Pale Grey&quot; (RAL 7035) with a &quot;Traffic Red&quot; (RAL 3020) stripe on the lower part of the vehicle. The continuous black band of windows and their oval door windows differentiate the ICEs from any other DB train.

The ICE 1 and ICE 2 units originally had an &quot;Orient Red&quot; (RAL 3031) stripe, accompanied by a &quot;Pastel Violet&quot; stripe below (RAL 4009, 26 cm wide). These stripes were repainted with the current Traffic Red between 1998 and 2000, when all ICE units were being checked and repainted in anticipation of the EXPO 2000.

The &quot;ICE&quot; lettering uses the colour &quot;Agate Grey&quot; (RAL 7038), the frame is painted in &quot;Quartz Grey&quot; (RAL 7039). The plastic platings in the interior all utilise the &quot;Pale Grey&quot; (RAL 7035) colour tone.

Originally, the ICE 1 interior was designed in pastel tones with an emphasis on mint, following the DB colour scheme of the day. However, ICE 1 trains were refurbished in the mid-2000s and now follow the same design as the ICE 3, which makes heavy usage of indirect lighting and wooden furnishings.

The distinctive ICE design was developed by a team of designers around Alexander Neumeister in the early 1980s and first used on the InterCityExperimental (ICE V). The team around Neumeister then designed the ICE 1, ICE 2, and ICE 3/T/TD. The interior of the trains was designed by Jens Peters working for BPR-Design in Stuttgart. Among others, he was responsible for the heightened roof in the restaurant car and the special lighting. The same team also developed the design for the now discontinued InterRegio trains in the mid-1980s.

=== Overview ===
=== First generation ===

The first ICE trains were the trainsets of ICE 1 (power cars: Class 401), which came into service in 1989. The first regularly scheduled ICE trains ran from 2 June 1991 from Hamburg-Altona via Hamburg Hbf–Hannover Hbf–Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe–Fulda–Frankfurt Hbf–Mannheim Hbf and Stuttgart Hbf toward München Hbf at hourly intervals on the new ICE line 6. The Hanover-Würzburg line and the Mannheim-Stuttgart line, which had both opened the same year, were hence integrated into the ICE network from the very beginning.

Due to the lack of trainsets in 1991 and early 1992, the ICE line 4 (Bremen Hbf–Hannover Hbf–Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe–Fulda–Würzburg Hbf–Nürnberg Hbf–München Hbf) could not start operating until 1 June 1992. Prior to that date, ICE trainsets were used when available and were integrated in the Intercity network and with IC tariffs.

In 1993, the ICE line 6&#x27;s terminus was moved from Hamburg to Berlin (later, in 1998, via the Hanover-Berlin line and the former IC line 3 from Hamburg-Altona via Hannover Hbf–Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe–Fulda–Frankfurt Hbf–Mannheim Hbf–Karlsruhe Hbf–Freiburg Hbf to Basel SBB was upgraded to ICE standards as a replacement).

=== Second generation ===
From 1997, the successor, the ICE 2 trains pulled by Class 402 powerheads, was put into service. One of the goals of the ICE 2 was to improve load balancing by building smaller train units which could be coupled or detached as needed.

These trainsets were used on the ICE line 10 Berlin-Cologne/Bonn. However, since the driving van trailers of the trains were still awaiting approval, the DB joined two portions (with one powerhead each) to form a long train, similar to the ICE 1. Only from 24 May 1998 were the ICE 2 units fully equipped with driving van trailers and could be portioned on their run from Hamm via either Dortmund Hbf–Essen Hbf–Duisburg Hbf–Düsseldorf Hbf or Hagen Hbf–Wuppertal Hbf–Solingen-Ohligs.

In late 1998, the Hanover–Berlin high-speed railway was opened as the third high-speed line in Germany, cutting travel time on line 10 (between Berlin and the Ruhr valley) by 2½ hours.

The ICE 1 and ICE 2 trains&#x27; loading gauge exceeds that recommended by the international railway organisation UIC. Even though the trains were originally to be used only domestically, some units are licensed to run in Switzerland and Austria. Some ICE 1 units have been equipped with an additional smaller pantograph to be able to run on the different Swiss overhead wire geometry.
All ICE 1 and ICE 2 trains are single-voltage 15 kV AC, which restricts their radius of operation largely to the German-speaking countries of Europe. ICE 2 trains can run at a top speed of 280 km/h (174 mph).

=== Third generation ===

To overcome the restrictions imposed on the ICE 1 and ICE 2, their successor, the ICE 3, was built to a smaller loading gauge to permit usability throughout the entire European standard gauge network, with the sole exception being the UK&#x27;s domestic railway network. Unlike their predecessors, the ICE 3 units are built not as trains with separate passenger and power cars, but as electric multiple units with underfloor motors throughout. This also reduced the load per axle and enabled the ICE 3 to comply with the pertinent UIC standard.

Initially two different classes were developed: the Class 403 (domestic ICE 3) and the Class 406 (ICE 3M), the M standing for &quot;Mehrsystem&quot; (multi-system). Later came Class 407 and Class 408. The trains were labelled and marketed as the Velaro by their manufacturer, Siemens.

Just like the ICE 2, the ICE 3 and the ICE 3M were developed as short trains (when compared to an ICE 1), and are able to travel in a system where individual units run on different lines, then being coupled to travel together. Since the ICE 3 trains are the only ones able to run on the Köln-Frankfurt high-speed line with its 4.0% incline at the allowed maximum speed of 300 km/h, they are used predominantly on services that utilise this line.

In 2009 Deutsche Bahn ordered another 16 units – worth € 495 million – for international traffic, especially to France.

The Erfurt–Leipzig/Halle high-speed railway, which opened in December 2015, is one of three lines in Germany (the others being the Nuremberg-Ingolstadt high-speed rail line and Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line) that are equipped for a line speed of . Since only 3rd generation ICE trains can travel at this speed, the ICE line 41, formerly running from Essen Hbf via Duisburg Hbf–Frankfurt Südbf to Nürnberg Hbf, was extended over the Nuremberg-Ingolstadt high-speed rail line and today the service run is Oberhausen Hbf–Duisburg Hbf–Frankfurt Hbf–Nürnberg Hbf–Ingolstadt Hbf–München Hbf.

The ICE 3 runs at speeds up to on the LGV Est railway Strasbourg–Paris in France.

A new generation ICE 3, Class 407, is part of the Siemens Velaro family with the model designation Velaro D. It currently runs on many services in Germany and through to other countries like France. Initially this train type was meant to execute the planned Deutsche Bahn services through the Channel Tunnel to London. As the trains had not received a certification for running in Belgium and due to the competition of budget airlines the London service was cancelled.

In 2020 Deutsche Bahn placed an order with Siemens for 30 trains, and options for another 60, of the Velaro design and based on the previously procured ICE Class 407. Referenced by Siemens as Velaro MS (&quot;multi-system&quot;), these trains are called &quot;ICE 3neo&quot; by Deutsche Bahn and classified as 408. The trains are designed for operation at 320 km/h and were deployed at the end of 2022 on routes that use the Cologne – Frankfurt high speed line which is designed for operation at 300 km/h. After a production time of only 12 months including trial runs the first train was presented to journalists in February of 2022. At that occasion the order was increased by 43 trainsets, with all 73 trains supposed to be in service by early 2029. In May of 2023 Deutsche Bahn announced that it was calling the last 17 trains from the option, bringing the total order up to 90 trains.

===Fourth generation===
Procurement of ICx trainsets started c. 2008 as replacements for locomotive hauled InterCity and EuroCity train services - the scope was later expanded to include replacements for ICE 1 and ICE 2 trainsets. In 2011 Siemens was awarded the contract for 130 seven car intercity train replacements, and 90 ten car ICE train replacements, plus further options - the contract for the ten car sets was modified in 2013 to expand the trainset length to twelve vehicles. The name ICx was used for the trains during the initial stages of the procurement; in late 2015 the trains were rebranded ICE 4, at the unveiling of the first trainset, and given the class designation 412 by Deutsche Bahn.

Two pre-production trainsets were manufactured and used for testing prior to the introduction of the main series.

=== ICE T and ICE TD ===

Simultaneously with the ICE 3, Siemens developed trains with tilting technology, using much of the ICE 3 technical design. The class 411 (seven cars) and 415 (five cars) ICE T EMUs and class 605 ICE TD DMUs (four cars) were built with a similar interior and exterior design. They were specially designed for older railway lines not suitable for high speeds, for example the twisting lines in Thuringia. ICE-TD has diesel traction. ICE-T and ICE-TD can be operated jointly, but this is not done routinely.

==== ICE T ====

A total of 60 class 411 and 11 class 415 have been built so far (units built after 2004 belong to the modified second generation ICE-T2 batch). Both classes work reliably. Austria&#x27;s ÖBB purchased three units in 2007, operating them jointly with DB. Even though DB assigned the name &quot;ICE-T&quot; to class 411/415, the &quot;T&quot; originally did not stand for &quot;tilting&quot;, but for &quot;Triebwagen&quot; (railcar), as DB&#x27;s marketing department at first deemed the top speed too low for assignment of the InterCityExpress brand and therefore planned to refer to this class as &quot;IC-T&quot; (InterCity-Triebwagen).
The trainsets of the T series were manufactured in 1999. The tilting system has been provided by Fiat Ferroviaria, now part of Alstom. ICE T trains can run at speeds of up to 230 km/h (143 mph).

==== ICE TD ====
Deutsche Bahn ordered 20 units of ICE-T with diesel engines in 2001, called Class 605 ICE-TD. The ICE-TD was intended for certain routes without electric overhead cables such as Dresden-Munich and Munich-Zürich lines. However, the Class 605 trains (ICE-TD) experienced many technical issues and unanticipated escalation in operating cost due to the diesel fuel being fully taxed in Germany. They were taken off revenue service shortly after delivery. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the ICE-TD trains were pressed temporarily into supplementary service for transporting fans between cities in Germany.

At the end of 2007, ICE-TD trains were put into revenue service for the lines between Hamburg and Copenhagen as well as Hamburg and Aarhus. A large part of the Danish railway network had not been electrified so DSB (Danish State Railways) used the diesel-powered trains. When DSB ordered the new IC4 train sets, the company did not anticipate the long delay with the delivery and the technical issues with the train sets. To compensate for the shortage of available trains, DSB leased the ICE-TD while the delivery and technical issues with IC4 were being addressed. The operating cost was much lower due to the lower fuel tax in Denmark. After the issues with IC4 were resolved, the ICE-TD fleet was removed from revenue service and stored.

Deutsche Bahn retired the entire ICE TD fleet in 2018.

=== Differences in train layouts ===



=== Trainset numbers ===
While every car in an ICE train has its own unique registration number, the trains usually remain coupled as fixed trainsets for several years. For easier reference, each has been assigned a &quot;trainset number&quot; that is printed over each bogie of every car. These numbers usually correspond with the registration numbers of the powerheads or cab cars.

=== Interior equipment ===
The ICE trains adhere to a high standard of technology: all cars are fully air-conditioned and nearly every seat features a headphone jack which enables the passenger to listen to several on-board music and voice programmes as well as several radio stations. Some seats in the 1st class section (in some trains also in 2nd class) are equipped with video displays showing movies and pre-recorded infotainment programmes. Each train is equipped with special cars that feature in-train repeaters for improved mobile phone reception as well as designated quiet zones where the use of mobile phones is discouraged. The newer ICE 3 trains also have larger digital displays in all coaches, displaying, among other things, Deutsche Bahn advertising, the predicted arrival time at the next destination and the current speed of the train.

The ICE 1 was originally equipped with a passenger information system based on BTX, however this system was eventually taped over and removed in the later refurbishment. The ICE 3 trains feature touch screen terminals in some carriages, enabling travellers to print train timetables. The system is also located in the restaurant car of the ICE 2.

The ICE 1 fleet saw a major overhaul between 2005 and 2008, supposed to extend the lifetime of the trains by another 15 to 20 years. Seats and the interior design were adapted to the ICE 3 design, electric sockets were added to every seat, the audio and video entertainment systems were removed and electronic seat reservation indicators were added above the seats. The ICE 2 trains have been undergoing the same procedure since 2010.

ICE 2 trains feature electric sockets at selected seats, ICE 3 and ICE T trains have sockets at nearly every seat.

The ICE 3 and ICE T are similar in their interior design, but the other ICE types differ in their original design. The ICE 1, the ICE 2 and seven-car ICE T (Class 411) are equipped with a full restaurant car. The five-car ICE T (Class 415) and ICE 3 however, have been designed without a restaurant, they feature a bistro coach instead. Since 1 October 2006, smoking is prohibited in the bistro coaches, similar to the restaurant cars, which have always been non-smoking.

All trains feature a toilet for disabled passengers and wheelchair spaces. The ICE 1 and ICE 2 have a special conference compartment whilst the ICE 3 features a compartment suitable for small children. The ICE 3 and ICE T omit the usual train manager&#x27;s compartment and have an open counter named &quot;ServicePoint&quot; instead.

An electronic display above each seat indicates the locations between which the seat has been reserved. Passengers without reservations are permitted to take seats with a blank display or seats with no reservation on the current section.

=== Maintenance ===
The maintenance schedule of the trains is divided into seven steps:

# Every 4,000 kilometres, an inspection taking about 1½ hours is undertaken. The waste collection tanks are emptied and fresh water tanks are refilled. Acute defects (e.g. malfunctioning doors) are rectified. Safety tests are also conducted. These include checking the pantograph pressure, cleaning and checking for fissures in the rooftop insulators, inspecting transformers and checking the pantograph&#x27;s current collector for wear. The wheels are also checked in this inspection.
# Every 20,000 kilometres, a 2½ hour inspection is conducted, called &quot;Nachschau&quot;. In this inspection, the brakes, the Linienzugbeeinflussung systems and the anti-lock brakes are checked.
# After 80,000 kilometres, the train undergoes the &quot;Inspektionsstufe 1&quot;. During the two modules, each lasting eight hours, the brakes receive a thorough check, as well as the air conditioning and the kitchen equipment. The batteries are checked, as well as the seats and the passenger information system.
# Once the train has reached 240,000 kilometres, the &quot;Inspektionsstufe 2&quot; mandates a check of the electric motors, the bearings and the driveshafts of the bogies and the couplers. This inspection is usually carried out in two modules taking eight hours each.
# About once a year (when reaching 480,000 km), the &quot;Inspektionsstufe 3&quot; takes place, at three times eight hours each. In addition to the other checkup phases, it includes checks on the pneumatics systems, and the transformer cooling. Maintenance work is performed inside the passenger compartment.
# The &quot;1st Revision&quot; is carried out after 1.2 million km. It includes a thorough check of all components of the train and is carried out in two five-day segments.
# The seventh and final step is the &quot;2nd Revision&quot;, which happens when reaching 2.4 million kilometres. The bogies are exchanged for new ones and many components of the train are disassembled and checked. This step also takes two five-day segments.

Maintenance on the ICE trains is carried out in special ICE workshops located in Basel, Berlin, Cologne, Dortmund, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Leipzig and Munich. The train is worked upon at up to four levels at a time and fault reports are sent to the workshops in advance by the on-board computer system to minimize maintenance time.

== Route planning and network layout ==


The ICE system is a polycentric network. Connections are offered in either 30-minute, hourly or bi-hourly intervals. Furthermore, additional services run during peak times, and some services call at lesser stations during off-peak times.

Unlike the French TGV or the Japanese Shinkansen systems, the vehicles, tracks and operations were not designed as an integrated whole; rather, the ICE system has been integrated into Germany&#x27;s pre-existing system of railway lines instead. One of the effects of this is that the ICE 3 trains can reach a speed of 300 km/h (186 mph) only on some stretches of line and cannot currently reach their maximum allowed speed of 330 km/h on German railway lines (though a speed of 320 km/h is reached by ICE 3 in France).

The line most heavily utilised by ICE trains is the Mannheim–Frankfurt railway between Frankfurt and Mannheim due to the bundling of many ICE lines in that region. When considering all traffic (freight, local and long-distance passenger), the busiest line carrying ICE traffic is the Munich–Augsburg line, carrying about 300 trains per day.

=== North–south connections ===
The network&#x27;s main backbone consists of six north–south lines:

# from Hamburg-Altona via Hamburg, Hannover, Kassel, Fulda, Frankfurt, Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Freiburg to Basel (line 20) or continuing from Mannheim to Stuttgart (line 22)
# from Hamburg-Altona and Hamburg and from Bremen to Hannover (where portions are joined) and via Kassel, Fulda and Würzburg to Nuremberg and via Ingolstadt to Munich (line 25)
# from Hamburg-Altona via Hamburg, Berlin-Spandau, Berlin, Berlin Südkreuz, Leipzig or Halle, Erfurt to Nuremberg and via Augsburg or Ingolstadt to Munich (lines 18, 28 and 29) or continuing from Erfurt via Fulda, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Ulm and Augsburg to Munich (line 11)
# from Berlin via Berlin-Spandau, Braunschweig, Kassel, Fulda, Frankfurt, Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Freiburg to Basel (line 12) or via Fulda and Frankfurt Süd to Frankfurt Airport (line 13)
# from Amsterdam or Dortmund via Duisburg, Düsseldorf, Cologne and Frankfurt Airport to Mannheim and either via Karlsruhe and Freiburg to Basel (line 43) or via Stuttgart, Ulm and Augsburg to Munich (lines 42 and 47)
# from Essen via Cologne, Frankfurt, Würzburg, Nuremberg and Ingolstadt to Munich (line 41)

(Also applies to trains in the opposite directions, taken from 2024 network map)

=== East–west connections ===
Furthermore, the network has three main east–west thoroughfares:
# from Berlin Gesundbrunnen via Berlin, Hannover, Bielefeld to Hamm (where train portions are split) and continuing either via Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg and Düsseldorf to Cologne/Bonn Airport or via Hagen and Wuppertal to Cologne (10, 19)
# from Dresden via Leipzig, Erfurt, Fulda, Frankfurt, Frankfurt Airport and Mainz to Wiesbaden (50)
# from Karlsruhe via Stuttgart, Ulm, and Augsburg to Munich (60)
(Also applies to trains in the opposite directions, taken from 2023 network map)

=== German branch lines ===
Some train lines extend past the core network and branch off to serve the following connections:
# from Berlin to Rostock (line 28, individual services)
# from Berlin to Stralsund (line 28, individual services)
# from Hamburg to Lübeck (line 25, individual services)
# from Hamburg to Kiel (lines 20, 22, 28 and 31, individual services)
# from Bremen to Oldenburg (lines 10, 22 and 25, individual services)
# from Leipzig via Hanover to Cologne (line 50, individual services)
# from Leipzig via Kassel to Düsseldorf (line 50, individual services)
# from Würzburg via Kassel to Essen (line 41, individual services)
# from Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen (lines 25, 28 and 41, individual services)
# from Nuremberg via Regensburg to Passau (line 91, every two hours)

(Also applies to trains in the opposite directions)

=== ICE Sprinter ===
The &quot;ICE Sprinter&quot; trains are trains with fewer stops between Germany&#x27;s major cities running in the morning and evening hours. They are tailored for business travellers or long-distance commuters and are marketed by DB as an alternative to domestic flights. Some of the Sprinter services continue as normal ICE services after reaching their destination. The service is usually half an hour faster than a standard ICE between the same cities.

A reservation was mandatory on the ICE Sprinter until December 2015.

The first Sprinter service was established between Munich and Frankfurt in 1992. Frankfurt-Hamburg followed in 1993 and Cologne-Hamburg in 1994. This service ran as a Metropolitan service between December 1996 and December 2004. In 1998, a Berlin-Frankfurt service was introduced and a service between Cologne and Stuttgart ran between December 2005 and October 2006.

Until December 2006, a morning Sprinter service ran between Frankfurt and Munich (with an intermediate stop at Mannheim), taking 3:25 hours for the journey. This has been since replaced by a normal ICE connection taking only 3:21 hours.

Starting with the December 2017 schedule change, a new Sprinter line links Berlin main station and Munich main station in less than four hours.

, the individual ICE Sprinter lines are:

=== Line segments abroad ===


Some ICE trains also run on services abroad – sometimes diverting from their original lines.

# from Frankfurt Hbf to Amsterdam Centraal (Netherlands) via Köln Hbf, Duisburg Hbf and Arnhem Centraal (lines 120, 122, 128, 126, 220, 222/121, 123, 127, 129, 221)
# from Frankfurt Hbf to Bruxelles-Midi/Brussel-Zuid (Belgium) via Köln Hbf, Aachen Hbf and Liège-Guillemins (lines 10, 12, 14, 18, 16, 314, 316/11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 315, 317)
# from Frankfurt Hbf and Stuttgart Hbf to Paris Est (France) via Karlsruhe Hbf and Strasbourg-Ville (lines 9568, 9572, 9574/9563, 9567, 9571, 9573)
# from Frankfurt Hbf to Paris Est via Saarbrücken Hbf (lines 9550, 9556, 9558/9553, 9555)
# from Hamburg-Altona, Kiel Hbf and Ostseebad Binz to Basel SBB and Zürich HB (Switzerland) via Frankfurt Hbf and Karlsruhe (lines 73, 75, 77, 79, 203, 205/72, 74, 76, 78, 272)
# from Frankfurt Hbf and Hamburg-Altona to Chur (Switzerland) via Karlsruhe, Basel SBB and Zürich HB (lines 271, 1271/70)

# from Amsterdam Centraal (Netherlands) to Basel SBB (Switzerland) via Frankfurt Hbf (line 105/104)
# from Munich to Zürich via Lindau-Reutin (operated by Swiss Federal Railways as EuroCity-Express)

(Also applies to the opposite directions)

Since December 2006, Stuttgart Hbf and Zürich HB have been connected by a bi-hourly service. This service however has been replaced by a daily Intercity service since March 2010.

The ÖBB in Austria also uses two ICE T trainsets (classified as ÖBB Class 4011) between Wien Hauptbahnhof, Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof and Bregenz (without stops in Germany), although they do not use tilting technology. Since December 2007 ÖBB and DB offer a bi-hourly connection between Wien Westbf and Frankfurt Hbf. On 12 December 2021 a new Railjet schedule was introduced by ÖBB between Frankfurt and Vienna on a different route via Stuttgart, Ulm, Biberach, Friedrichshafen, Lindau, Bregenz and Innsbruck. Since 11 June 2023 a new ICE service is operated by Deutsche Bahn via the same route between Dortmund and Innsbruck on ICE 4 trains replacing the IC 118/119 service. 

Since June 2007 ICE 3M trains had been running between Frankfurt Hbf and Paris Est via Saarbrücken and Kaiserslautern. Together with the TGV-operated service between Paris Est and München Hbf via Stuttgart Hbf (TGV 9576/9577), this ICE line was part of the &quot;LGV Est européenne&quot;, also called &quot;Paris-Ostfrankreich-Süddeutschland&quot; (or POS) for short, a pan-European high-speed line between France and Germany. This service now co-exists with a direct TGV service (TGV 9551/9552).

From late 2007, ICE TD trains linked Berlin Hbf with Copenhagen and Aarhus via Hamburg Hbf. These services have been operated since December 2017 by Danish IC3 sets as EuroCity services.

A EuroCity-Express service was introduced between Munich and Zürich in December 2020 with the completion of the electrification of the line in Germany, replacing a EuroCity service. Six pairs of trains run every two hours and are operated by Swiss Federal Railways with Alstom ETR 610 (&quot;Astoro&quot;) sets.

In addition, ICE Trains to London via the Channel Tunnel are on the horizon. Unique safety and security requirements for the tunnel (such as airport-style checks at stations) as well as hold-ups in the production of the Velaro-D trains to be used on the route have delayed these plans.

=== Intra-Swiss ICE trains ===
To avoid empty runs or excess waits, several services exist that operate exclusively inside Switzerland:
* three services from Basel SBB to Interlaken Ost
* two services from Basel SBB to Zürich HB
* three service from Interlaken Ost to Basel SBB
* one service from Interlaken Ost to Bern
* two services from Zürich HB to Basel SBB
* one service from Bern to Interlaken Ost

These trains, despite being officially notated as ICEs, are more comparable to a Swiss InterRegio or RegioExpress train, calling at small stations like or . As common in Switzerland, these trains can be used without paying a supplement.

There have been several accidents involving ICE trains. The Eschede disaster was the only accident with fatalities inside the train, but other accidents have resulted in major damage to the trainsets involved.

=== Eschede disaster ===

The ICE accident near Eschede that happened on 3 June 1998 was a severe railway accident. Trainset 51, travelling as ICE 884 &quot;Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen&quot; from Munich to Hamburg, derailed at 200 km/h (124 mph), killing 101 people and injuring 88. It remains the world&#x27;s worst high-speed rail disaster.

The cause of the accident was a wheel rim which broke and damaged the train six kilometres south of the accident site. The wheel rim penetrated the carriage floor and lifted the check rail of a set of points close to Eschede station. This guide rail also penetrated the floor of the car, becoming embedded in the vehicle and lifting the nearby wheels off the rails. One of the now-derailed wheels struck the points lever of the following set of points to change direction, and the rear cars of the trainset were diverted to a different track. They hit the pillars of a street overpass, which then collapsed onto the tracks. Only three cars and the front powerhead passed under the bridge, the rest of the 14-car train jack-knifed into the collapsed bridge.

=== Other accidents ===

On 27 September 2001, trainset 5509 fell off a work platform at the Hof maintenance facility and was written off.

On 22 November 2001, powerhead &quot;401 020&quot; caught fire. The train was stopped at the station in Offenbach am Main near Frankfurt a.M. No passengers were harmed, but the fire caused the powerhead to be written off.

On 6 January 2004, ICE TD trainset 1106 caught fire while it was parked at Leipzig. Two cars were written off, and the others are now used as spares.

On 1 April 2004, trainset 321 collided with a tractor that had fallen onto the track at a tunnel entrance near Istein, and was derailed. No-one was injured. Trainset 321 was temporarily taken apart, its cars being switched with cars from other ICE 3 trainsets.

Powerhead &quot;401 553&quot; suffered major damage in a collision with a car on the Mannheim–Frankfurt railway in April 2006.

On 28 April 2006, trainset 73 collided head-on with two BLS Re 465 locomotives at Thun in Switzerland. The driver of the Swiss locomotives was unfamiliar with the new layout of the station, which had been recently changed. He did not see a shunting signal ordering him to stop. The locomotives automatically engaged the emergency brakes when he passed the signal, but came to a stop on the same track as the approaching ICE. The ICE was travelling at a speed of 74 km/h. The emergency brake slowed the train to 56 km/h at the point of collision. 30 passengers and the driver of the ICE suffered minor injuries, the driver of the Swiss locomotives having jumped to safety. Both trains suffered major damage. The powerhead &quot;401 573&quot; had to be rebuilt using components from three damaged powerheads (&quot;401 573&quot;, &quot;401 020&quot; and &quot;401 551&quot;).

On 1 March 2008, trainset 1192, travelling as ICE 23, collided with a tree which had fallen onto the track near Brühl after being blown down by Cyclone Emma. The driver suffered severe injuries. The trainset is back in service, its driving-car having been replaced with that from trainset 1106.

On 26 April 2008, trainset 11, travelling as ICE 885, collided with a herd of sheep on the Hanover-Würzburg high-speed rail line near Fulda. Both powerheads and ten of the 12 cars derailed. The train came to a stop 1300 metres into the Landrückentunnel. 19 of the 130 passengers suffered mostly minor injuries, four of them needing hospital treatment.

A cracked axle was blamed for a low-speed derailment of a third-generation ICE in Cologne in July 2008. The accident, in which no-one was hurt, caused DB to recall its newest ICEs as a safety measure. In October 2008, the company recalled its ICE-T trains after a further crack was found.

On 17 April 2010, ICE 105 Amsterdam - Basel lost a door while travelling at high speed near Montabaur. The door slammed into the side of ICE 612 on the adjacent track. Six people travelling on ICE 612 were injured.

On 17 August 2010, the ICE from Frankfurt to Paris hit a truck that had slid from an embankment on to the rail near Lambrecht. The first two carriages derailed and ten people were injured, one seriously.

On 11 January 2011, trainset 4654 partly derailed during a side-on collision with a freight train near Zevenaar in the Netherlands. There were no injuries.

On 2 May 2017, a trainset was derailed at Dortmund Hauptbahnhof. Two people were injured.

On 12 October 2018, two cars of a trainset caught fire while it was traveling from Cologne to Munich on the Cologne-Frankfurt line. Five people suffered minor injuries during the evacuation.

== Fare structure ==
=== Germany ===
ICE trains are the highest category (Class A) trains in the fare system of the Deutsche Bahn. Their fares are not calculated on a fixed per-kilometre table as with other trains, but instead have fixed prices for station-to-station connections, depending on a multitude of factors including the railway line category and the general demand on the line. Even on lines where the ICE is not faster than an ordinary IC or EC train (for example Hamburg to Dortmund), an additional surcharge will be levied on the ground that the ICE trains have a higher comfort level than IC/EC trains.

=== Austria ===
On the intra-Austrian lines (Vienna-Innsbruck-Bregenz, Vienna-Salzburg(-Munich), Vienna-Passau(-Hamburg) and Innsbruck-Kufstein(-Berlin)) no additional fees are charged.

=== Switzerland ===
Likewise, the trains running to and from Zürich, Interlaken and Chur, as well as those on the intra-Swiss ICE trains (see above) can be used without any surcharge.

=== Netherlands ===
On ICE trains between Amsterdam and Cologne, passengers travelling nationally within the Netherlands (between Amsterdam Centraal and Arnhem Centraal) can use the national OV-chipkaart scheme but have to purchase a supplement. Passengers travelling into/from Germany have to buy an international ticket.

=== France ===
On ICE trains between Paris Est and Frankfurt or Stuttgart, only the fare system from SNCF Voyageurs is used for national trips to Forbach and Strasbourg. Reservation is compulsory for trips to/from and within France.

== Scale models ==
Various ICE train scale models in several scales have been produced by Märklin, Fleischmann, Roco, Trix, Mehano, PIKO. and Lima.

==Possible future service to London==
In January 2010, the European railway network was opened to a liberalisation intended to allow greater competition. Both Air France-KLM and Deutsche Bahn have indicated their desire to take advantage of the new laws to run new services via the Channel Tunnel and the High Speed 1 route that terminates at London St Pancras International. A test run of an ICE train through the Channel Tunnel took place on 19 October 2010. Passenger-carrying ICE trains, however, will have to meet safety requirements in order to transit the Channel Tunnel. Although the requirement for splittable trains was lifted, concerns remain over the shorter length of ICE trainsets, fire safety, and the ICE&#x27;s distributed power arrangements. There have been suggestions that French interests have advocated stringent enforcement to delay a competitor on the route. Eurostar also recently chose Siemens Velaro-based rolling stock; there were concerns that Alstom (builders of the passenger trains that already use the Tunnel) and the French Government would take the matter to court. In October 2010, the French transport minister suggested that the European Railway Agency (based in France) should arbitrate. After safety rule changes which might permit the use of Siemens Velaro rolling stock, the French government dismissed their delegate to the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority, and brought in a replacement.

In March 2011, a European Rail Agency report authorized trains with distributed traction for use in the Channel Tunnel. This means that the ICE class 407 trains which DB intends to use for its London services will be able to run through the tunnel. In February 2014, however, Deutsche Bahn announced further difficulties with launching the route, and reports make it seem unlikely that service will start anytime this decade.

In June 2018, Deutsche Bahn announced that it was shelving plans to revive a potential London-Frankfurt ICE connection. The service would take around 5 hours and could rival airlines and become the first competitor for Eurostar.
== Ridership ==

From its inception in July 1991 to 2006, ICE has transported roughly 550 million passengers, including 67 million in 2005. The cumulative sum of passengers is roughly 1.25 billion in 2015.

== Legacy ==
On 5 October 2006, the Deutsche Post AG released a series of stamps, among them a stamp picturing an ICE 3, at 55+25 euro cents.

In 2006, Lego modelled one of its train sets after the ICE. A Railworks add on is available for Train Simulator 2018 accurately reflecting the original 1991 version of the ICE on German tracks (Siegen to Hagen). There is also an addon utilising the Munich - Augsburg line using ICE 3 trainsets. The ICE 3 can also be used in Career scenarios on the Mannheim-Karlsruhe route (including the extension to Frankfurt), and Cologne-Düsseldorf. The ICE T, ICE 2, and ICE TD are also available for purchase as separate vehicles.

<doc id="186717" wikidata="Q151095" url="?curid=186717" title="Duchy of Berg">
<text>Berg was a state—originally a county, later a duchy—in the Rhineland of Germany. Its capital was Düsseldorf. It existed as a distinct political entity from the early 12th to the 19th centuries. It was a member state of the Holy Roman Empire.

The name of the county lives on in the modern geographic term Bergisches Land, often misunderstood as &quot;bergiges Land&quot; (hilly country).

==History==
===Ascent===
The Counts of Berg emerged in 1101 as a junior line of the dynasty of the Ezzonen, which traced its roots back to the 9th-century Kingdom of Lotharingia, and in the 11th century became the most powerful dynasty in the region of the lower Rhine.

In 1160, the territory split into two portions, one of them later becoming the County of the Mark, which returned to the possession of the family line in the 16th century. The most powerful of the early rulers of Berg, Engelbert II of Berg died in an assassination on November 7, 1225. In 1280 the counts moved their court from Schloss Burg on the Wupper river to the town of Düsseldorf. Count Adolf VIII of Berg fought on the winning side in the Battle of Worringen against Guelders in 1288.

The power of Berg grew further in the 14th century. The County of Jülich united with the County of Berg in 1348, and in 1380 the Emperor Wenceslaus elevated the counts of Berg to the rank of dukes, thus originating the Duchy of Jülich-Berg.

===Problems of succession===
In 1509, John III, Duke of Cleves, made a strategic marriage to Maria von Geldern, daughter of William IV, Duke of Jülich-Berg, who became heiress to her father&#x27;s estates: Jülich, Berg and the County of Ravensberg, which under the Salic laws of the Holy Roman Empire caused the properties to pass to the husband of the female heir (women could not hold property except through a husband or a guardian). With the death of her father in 1511 the Dukes of Jülich-Berg became extinct, and the estate thus came under the rule of John III, Duke of Cleves — along with his personal territories, the County of the Mark and the Duchy of Cleves (&quot;Kleve&quot;) in a personal union. As a result of this union the dukes of the United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg controlled much of present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, with the exception of the clerical states of the Archbishop of Cologne and of the Bishop of Münster.

William the Rich was the second duke of the united Julich-Cleves-Berg. He introduced the Gregorian Calendar into the duchies.

However, the new ducal dynasty also became extinct in 1609, when the last duke died insane. This led to a lengthy dispute over succession to the various territories before the partition of 1614: the Count Palatine of Neuburg, who had converted to Catholicism, annexed Jülich and Berg; while Cleves and Mark fell to John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, who subsequently also became Duke of Prussia. 

=== Wittelsbach Rule ===
Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg, became duke. He was a member of the powerful House of Wittelsbach, which ruled Bavaria and the Electoral Palatinate. During his reign, Düsseldorf served as his center of court on occasion.

During the 30 Years&#x27; War, even though there were no significant battles around Berg, the territories still had to deal with the stresses of war. At the end of the 30 Years&#x27; War, Wolfgang Wilhelm tried to spread Catholicism in the duchies. The Elector of Brandenburg, Frederick Wilhelm, still claimed the Duchy of Berg, and declared war, claiming to be the defender of protestants in Berg. This led to the Düsseldorf Cow War. In the following years however, tension over Berg between Neuburg and Brandenburg greatly decreased.

Upon the extinction of the senior Wittelsbach dynasty ruling the Electorate of the Palatinate in 1685, the Neuburg line inherited the Electorate and generally made Düsseldorf its capital. Elector Charles III Philipp disliked Düsseldorf, because the estates there did not want to grant the funds he demanded. As such, he moved his capital from Düsseldorf to Mannheim, where it remained until the Elector Palatine, Charles Theodore, inherited the Electorate of Bavaria in 1777.

===French revolution, Grand Duchy of Berg===

The French occupation (1794–1801) and annexation (1801) of Jülich (French: Juliers) during the French revolutionary wars separated the two duchies of Jülich and Berg, and in 1803 Berg separated from the other Bavarian territories and came under the rule of a junior branch of the Wittelsbachs. In 1806, in the reorganization of the German lands occasioned by the end of the Holy Roman Empire, Berg became the Grand Duchy of Berg, under the rule of Napoleon&#x27;s brother-in-law, Joachim Murat. Murat&#x27;s arms combined the red lion of Berg with the arms of the duchy of Cleves. The anchor and the batons came to the party due to Murat&#x27;s positions as Grand Admiral and as Marshal of the Empire. As the husband of Napoleon&#x27;s sister Caroline Bonaparte, Murat also had the right to use the imperial eagle.

In 1809, one year after Murat&#x27;s promotion from Grand Duke of Berg to King of Naples, Napoleon&#x27;s young nephew, Prince Napoleon Louis Bonaparte (1804–1831, elder son of Napoleon&#x27;s brother Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland) became the Grand Duke of Berg; French bureaucrats administered the territory in the name of the child. The Grand Duchy&#x27;s short existence came to an end with Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1813 and the peace settlements that followed.

===Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg===
In 1815, after the Congress of Vienna, Berg became part of a province of the Kingdom of Prussia: the Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. In 1822 this province united with the Grand Duchy of the Lower Rhine to form the Rhine Province.

<text>The Bergisches Land (, &quot;Berg Country&quot;) is a low mountain range in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, east of the Rhine and south of the Ruhr. The landscape is shaped by forests, meadows, rivers and creeks and contains over twenty artificial lakes. Wuppertal is the biggest town, while the southern part has economic and socio-cultural ties to Cologne. Wuppertal and the neighbouring cities of Remscheid and Solingen form the Bergisches Städtedreieck (&quot;Berg City Triangle&quot;).
==Geography==
===Demarcation===
====Historically====
The Bergisches Land emerged from the historic Duchy of Berg. The region also owes its name to the former sovereigns, the Counts (and later Dukes) of the . The adjectival Latin term terre Montensis, i.e. of the Bergisches Land, was first recorded in writing in a , although terra de Monte or Land von Berg appeared in earlier documents.

Important places in the duchy were Gerresheim, Elberfeld, Solingen, Lennep, Radevormwald, Wipperfürth, Bensberg, Siegburg and , most of which received city rights from the 13th century. The seat of the counts and dukes was initially in Altenberg near Odenthal, after the construction of Burg Castle the town of (today a district of Solingen) and then from 1386 to 1822 Düsseldorf, which the dukes became a representative residence - and expanded the capital of the Duchy. The in Düsseldorf&#x27;s coat of arms still points to the historical affiliation of Düsseldorf to the Bergisches Land.

The northern parts of the Bergisches Land included the cities of Mülheim an der Ruhr, parts of Duisburg, Essen and Oberhausen ( and ), and the areas on the western border also included the area on the right bank of the Rhine, Cologne near Mülheim. Smaller areas on the left bank of the Rhine belonging to the duchy were also Wesseling, Rodenkirchen, and 

The former lordships of and in today&#x27;s Oberberg district, on the other hand, were only added to the Grand Duchy of Berg during Napoleon&#x27;s time. This originally non-Bergisch area includes Marienheide, Wiehl, Nümbrecht, the town of Bergneustadt and today&#x27;s district seat of the Oberbergischer district: Gummersbach.

====Geographically====
The natural region Bergisches Land lies almost entirely in the main unit group Süder Uplands, which also includes almost the entire Sauerland. The Süder Uplands represent the north-eastern part of the Rhenish Massif on the right bank of the Rhine.

Natural orographic borders form the Ruhr in the north, the Rhine in the west and the Sieg in the south. To the east it merges into the Sauerland without a recognizable scenic border. Political and cultural differences alone determine the course of the border between the two historical landscapes, which, however, roughly corresponds to the eastern watersheds of Wupper and Agger, while the (western) Sauerland is mainly drained by the Ruhr and its tributaries.

The largest part of the Bergisches Land is characterized by a varied low mountain range landscape with forests, meadows and hills as well as narrow s also called with small streams. Except for the areas that transition into the Sauerland, the Bergisches Land is referred to as peneplain due to the advanced erosion of the mountains.

Westwards from the low mountain range, across various , a plain without significant elevations, which is highly sprawled by the urban agglomerations of Cologne and Düsseldorf and - compared to the low mountain range landscape - is very little structured. Here, with a few heath relics, such as the , and , the spacious forest area and individual quarry lakes, such as Lake Unterbach or the , valuable &quot;nature reserves and recreation areas for the inhabitants of the surrounding cities.

The also defines the area as a recreational area. Although the proportion of forest is quite large, there are only a few larger contiguous forest areas. Forested mountain ranges in long waves and meadow valleys characterize the landscape. To the east, the proportion of forest landscape increases due to the unfavorable weather conditions for agriculture associated with the altitude. Naturally, mainly beech forests and beech-oak forests would grow on the hillsides. However, since the considerable deforestation in the early modern period, large areas have been reforested with spruce, which was not native to the region. The on the southern edge of the Bergisches Land is one of the largest forest areas and largely uninhabited. Another large forest area is the between Engelskirchen, and Overath-.

====Modern definitions====
Today, the Bergisches Land corresponds to the &quot;Bergisches Land low mountain range region&quot;. In the formerly Bergisch Rhine and Ruhr cities (Düsseldorf, southern districts of Oberhausen, and Mülheim an der Ruhr), the population&#x27;s historical affiliation with the Bergisch region is hardly still present. In these places, people mostly see themselves as Rhinelanders or belonging to the Ruhr area. Above the Rhine plain, however, people take their affiliation to the Bergisches Land for granted. In the news of WDR, only the eastern areas are referred to as &quot;Bergisches Land&quot;, whereas the western ones are counted as part of the unclearly circumscribed &quot;Rhineland&quot;. The Mettmann district is also included in the cultural region Bergisches Land. The Bergisches Land cultural region includes the cities of Wuppertal, Remscheid, Solingen and the districts of Mettmann, Oberberg and Rhein-Berg. In addition to the cities of Wuppertal, Remscheid and Solingen, as well as the Rheinisch-Bergisch and Oberbergisch districts, the Mettmann district belongs to the Bergisches Land cultural region.

The capital of the Bergisches Land is usually no longer seen as the historic capital Düsseldorf, but rather as the city Wuppertal, which was created in 1929 and forms the economic, cultural and industrial center of the eastern Bergisches Land. However, the south of the region has now developed a stronger connection to Cologne.

Even in those districts of Cologne on the right bank of the Rhine that are historically and geographically part of the Bergisches Land, it can be seen that there is hardly any sense of belonging to the Bergisches Land, and that the inhabitants of these districts almost exclusively see themselves as Rhinelanders. An exception is the Rath/Heumar district of Cologne, which arose in the course of the and borders on Bergisch Gladbach and Rösrath, which according to the prevailing regional awareness is part of the Bergisches Land region. The long-established population in particular has a very strong sense of belonging to the Bergisches Land.

== History ==
Bergisches Land used to be territory of the County of Berg, which later became the Duchy of Berg, who gave the region its name. The Duchy was dissolved in 1815 and in 1822 the region became part of the Prussian Rhine Province.

Amongst the population today, a sense of belonging to the region Bergisches Land is notable in the hilly northern part, but not so much anymore in the areas near the Cologne Lowland, the Ruhr area or the city of Düsseldorf.

=== Economic upswing ===
The region became famous during the period of its early industrialisation in the 19th century. At that time Wupper Valley was a historical &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. Its twin cities &quot;Barmen&quot; and &quot;Elberfeld&quot; were the trading- and industrial capitals of Prussia at that time. This economic upswing caused the expansion of the Ruhr as coal-mining area and gave birth to research on, and the theoretical underlining of social entrepreneurship and socialism: Friedrich Engels was born in Barmen to a textile mill owner.

After the industrial downturn from the 1960s on, the region lost importance but cooperations by Bergisches Land entrepreneurs, active citizens and politicians are bringing back some regional awareness and economic power.

<text>Enclosure or inclosure is a term, used in English landownership, that refers to the appropriation of &quot;waste&quot; or &quot;common land&quot;, enclosing it, and by doing so depriving commoners of their traditional rights of access and usage. Agreements to enclose land could be either through a formal or informal process. The process could normally be accomplished in three ways. First there was the creation of &quot;closes&quot;, taken out of larger common fields by their owners. Secondly, there was enclosure by proprietors, owners who acted together, usually small farmers or squires, leading to the enclosure of whole parishes. Finally there were enclosures by acts of Parliament.

The stated justification for enclosure was to improve the efficiency of agriculture. However, there were other motives too, one example being that the value of the land enclosed would be substantially increased. There were social consequences to the policy, with many protests at the removal of rights from the common people. Enclosure riots are seen by historians as &#x27;the pre-eminent form&#x27; of social protest from the 1530s to 1640s.

==History==

After William I invaded and conquered England in 1066, he distributed its land amongst 180 barons, who held it as his tenants in chief, establishing a feudal system. However he promised the English people that he would keep the laws of Edward the Confessor. Thus commoners were still able to exercise their ancient customary rights. The original contract bound the people who occupied the land to provide some form of service. This later evolved into a financial agreement that avoided or replaced the service.

Following the introduction of the feudal system, there was an increase in the economic growth and urban expansion of the country. In the 13th century, successful Lords did very well financially, while the peasants faced with ever increasing costs did not, and their landholding dwindled. After outbreaks of the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century however, there was a major decline in population and crop yields. The decline in population left the surviving farm workers in great demand. Landowners faced the choice of raising wages to compete for workers or letting their lands go unused. Wages for labourers rose and translated into inflation across the economy. The ensuing difficulties in hiring labour has been seen as causing the abandonment of land and the demise of the feudal system, although some historians have suggested that the effects of the Black Death may have only sped up an already on-going process.

From as early as the 12th century agricultural land had been enclosed. However, the history of enclosure in England is different from region to region. Parts of south-east England (notably sections of Essex and Kent) retained the pre-Roman Celtic field system of farming in small enclosed fields. Similarly in much of west and north-west England, fields were either never open, or were enclosed early. The primary area of field management, known as the &quot;open field system,&quot; was in the lowland areas of England in a broad band from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire diagonally across England to the south, taking in parts of Norfolk and Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, large areas of the Midlands, and most of south central England.

==Methods of enclosure==
There were essentially two broad categories of enclosure, these were &#x27;formal&#x27; or &#x27;informal&#x27; agreements. Formal enclosure was achieved either through act of Parliament, or, from 1836 onwards, by a written agreement signed by all parties involved. The written record would probably also include a map.

With informal agreements there was either minimal or no written record other than occasionally a map of the agreement. The most straightforward informal enclosure was through &#x27;unity of possession&#x27;. Under this, if an individual managed to acquire all the disparate strips of land in an area and consolidate them in one whole piece, for example a manor, then any communal rights would cease to exist, since there was no one to exercise them.

===Open-field system===
Before the enclosures in England, &quot;common&quot; land was under the control of the manorial lord. The usual manor consisted of two elements, the peasant tenantry and the lord&#x27;s holding, known as the &quot;demesne&quot; farm. The land the lord held was for his benefit and was farmed by his own direct employees or by hired labour. The tenant farmers had to pay rent. This could either be cash, labour or produce. Tenants had certain rights such as pasture, pannage, or estovers that could be held by neighbouring properties, or (occasionally) &quot;in gross&quot; by all manorial tenants. &quot;Waste&quot; land was often very narrow areas, typically less than wide, in awkward locations (such as cliff edges, or inconveniently shaped manorial borders), but also could be bare rock, it was not officially used by anyone, and so was often &quot;farmed&quot; by landless peasants.

The remaining land was organised into a large number of narrow strips, each tenant possessing several disparate strips throughout the manor, as would the manorial lord. The open-field system was administered by manorial courts, which exercised some collective control.
The land in a manor under this system would consist of:
* Two or three very large common fields
* Several very large common hay meadows
* Closes.
* In some cases, a park.
* Common &quot;waste&quot;.
What might now be termed a single field would have been divided under this system among the lord and his tenants; poorer peasants (serfs or copyholders, depending on the era) were allowed to live on the strips owned by the lord in return for cultivating his land. The open-field system was probably a development of the earlier Celtic field system, which it replaced. The open-field system used a three-field crop rotation system. Barley, oats, or legumes would be planted in one field in spring, wheat or rye in the second field in the autumn. There was no such thing as artificial fertilizer in mediaeval England, so the continual use of arable land for crops would exhaust the fertility of the soil. The open-field system solved that problem. It did this by allowing the third field, of the arable land, to be uncultivated each year and use that &quot;fallow&quot; field for grazing animals, on the stubble of the old crop. The manure the animals produced in the fallow field would help restore its fertility. The following year, the fields for planting and fallow would be rotated.

The very nature of the three field rotation system imposed a discipline on lord and tenants in their management of the arable land. Every one had the freedom to do what they liked with their own land but had to follow the rhythms of the rotation system. The land-holding tenants had livestock, including sheep, pigs, cattle, horses, oxen, and poultry, and after harvest, the fields became &#x27;common&#x27; so they could graze animals on that land. There are still examples of villages that use the open-field system, one example being Laxton, Nottinghamshire.

===The end of the open-field system===
Seeking better financial returns, landowners looked for more efficient farming techniques. They saw enclosure as a way to improve efficiency, however it was not simply the fencing of existing holdings; there was also a fundamental change in agricultural practice. One of the most important innovations was the development of the Norfolk four-course system, which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow periods. Wheat was grown in the first year, turnips in the second, followed by barley, with clover and ryegrass in the third. The clover and ryegrass were grazed or cut for feed in the fourth year. The turnips were used for feeding cattle and sheep in the winter. The practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons helped to restore plant nutrients and reduce the build-up of pathogens and pests. The system also improves soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. For example, turnips can recover nutrients from deep under the soil. Planting crops such as turnips and clover was not realistic under the open field system because the unrestricted access to the field meant that other villagers&#x27; livestock would graze on the turnips. Another important feature of the Norfolk system was that it used labour at times when demand was not at peak levels.

From as early as the 12th century, some open fields in Britain were being enclosed into individually owned fields. After the Statute of Merton in 1235 manorial lords were able to reorganize strips of land such that they were brought together in one contiguous block.

Copyholders had a &quot;customary tenancy&quot; on their piece of land that was legally enforceable. The problem was that a &quot;copyhold tenancy&quot; was only valid for the holder&#x27;s life. The heir would not have the right to inheritance although usually by custom, in exchange for a fee (known as a fine), the heir could have the copyhold transferred. To remove their customary rights, the landlords converted the copyhold into a leasehold tenancy. Leasehold removed the customary rights but the advantage to the tenant was that the land could be inherited.
There was a significant rise in enclosure during the Tudor period. Enclosure was quite often undertaken unilaterally by the landowner, sometimes illegally. The widespread eviction of people from their lands resulted in the collapse of the open field system in those areas. The deprivations of the displaced workers has been seen by historians as a cause of subsequent social unrest.

===Legislation===
In Tudor England the ever increasing demand for wool had a dramatic effect on the landscape. The attraction of large profits to be made from wool encouraged manorial lords to enclose common land and convert it from arable to (mainly) sheep pasture. The consequent eviction of commoners or villagers from their homes and loss of their livelihoods became an important political issue for the Tudors. The resulting depopulation was financially disadvantageous to the Crown. The authorities were concerned that many of the people subsequently dispossessed would become vagabonds and thieves. Also the depopulation of villages would produce a weakened workforce and enfeeble the military strength of the state.

From the time of Henry VII, Parliament began passing acts either to stop enclosure, to limit its effects, or at least to fine those responsible. The so-called &#x27;tillage acts&#x27;, were passed between 1489 and 1597.

The people who were responsible for the enforcement of the acts were the same people who were actually opposed to them. Consequently, the acts were not strictly enforced. Ultimately with rising popular opposition to sheep farming, the Tillage Act 1533 (25 Hen. 8. c. 13) restricted the size of flocks of sheep to no more than 2,400. Then the Taxation Act 1549 (3 &amp; 4 Edw. 6. c. 23) was introduced that imposed a poll tax on sheep that was coupled with a levy on home produced cloth. The result made sheep farming less profitable. However, in the end it was market forces that were responsible for stopping the conversion of arable into pasture. An increase in corn prices during the second half of the 16th century made arable farming more attractive, so although enclosures continued the emphasis was more on efficient use of the arable land.

==Parliamentary inclosure acts==

Historically, the initiative to enclose land came either from a landowner hoping to maximise rental from their estate, or a tenant farmer wanting to improve their farm. Before the 17th century enclosures were generally by informal agreement. When they first introduced enclosure by act of Parliament the informal method continued too. The first enclosure by act of Parliament was in 1604 (the Melcombe Regis and Radipole, Dorset (Church) Act 1603 (1 Jas. 1. c. 30)) and was for Radipole, Dorset. This was followed by many more acts of Parliament and by the 1750s the parliamentary system became the more usual method.

The Inclosure Act 1773 (13 Geo. 3. c. 81) created a law that enabled &quot;enclosure&quot; of land, at the same time removing the right of commoners&#x27; access. Although there was usually compensation, it was often in the form of a smaller and poorer quality plot of land. Between 1604 and 1914 there were more than 5,200 inclosure bills which amounted to of land that equated to approximately one fifth of the total area of England.

Parliamentary inclosure was also used for the division and privatisation of common &quot;wastes&quot; such as fens, marshes, heathland, downland and moors.

===Commissioners of inclosure===
The statutory process included the appointment of commissioners. The process of enclosure was weighted in favour of the tithe owner who had the right to appoint one inclosure commissioner for their parish. Tithe-owners (usually the Anglican clergy) could voluntarily commutate tithe payments to a rental charge, this would have the effect of reducing their income, so many refused to allow it. However the Tithe Act 1836 (6 &amp; 7 Will. 4. c. 71) made it compulsory for tithe payments to be commutated to a rent charge instead.
After the (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 118) permanent Inclosure Commissioners were appointed who could approve enclosures without having to submit to Parliament.

The Rev. William Homer was a commissioner and he provided a job description in 1766:

After 1899, the Board of Agriculture, which later became the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, inherited the powers of the Inclosure Commissioners.

One of the objectives of enclosure was to improve local roads. Commissioners were given authorisation to replace old roads and country lanes with new roads that were wider and straighter than those they replaced.

===Enclosure roads===
The road system of England had been problematic for some time. An 1852 government report described the condition of a road between Surrey and Sussex as &quot;very ruinous and almost impassable.&quot; In 1749 Horace Walpole wrote to a friend complaining that if he desired good roads &quot;never to go into Sussex&quot; and another writer said that the &quot;Sussex road is an almost insuperable evil&quot;. The problem was that country lanes were worn out and this had been compounded by the movement of cattle. Thus the commissioners were given powers to build wide straight roads that would allow for the passage of cattle. The completed new roads would be subject to inspection by the local justices, to make sure they were of a suitable standard. In the late eighteenth century the width of the enclosure roads was at least , but from the 1790s this was decreased to , and later 30 feet as the normal maximum width. Straight roads of early origin, if not Roman were probably enclosure roads. They were established in the period between 1750 and 1850. The building of the new roads, especially when linked up with new roads in neighbouring parishs and ultimately the turnpikes, was a permanent improvement to the road system of the country. 
==Social and economic factors==

The social and economic consequences of enclosure has been much discussed by historians. In the Tudor period Sir Thomas More in his &quot;Utopia&quot; said:
An anonymous poem, known as &quot;The Goose and the Common&quot; has come to represent the opposition to the enclosure movement in the 18th century:

According to one academic: 

In 1770 Oliver Goldsmith wrote the poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, in it condemns rural depopulation, the enclosure of common land, the creation of landscape gardens and the pursuit of excessive wealth.

During the 19th and early 20th century historians generally had sympathy for the cottagers who rented their dwellings from the manorial lord and also the landless labourers. John and Barbara Hammond said that &quot;enclosure was fatal to three classes: the small farmer, the cottager and the squatter.&quot; &quot;Before enclosure the cottager was a labourer with land; after enclosure was a labourer without land.&quot;

Marxist historians, such as Barrington Moore Jr., focused on enclosure as a part of the class conflict that eventually eliminated the English peasantry and saw the emergence of the bourgeoisie. From this viewpoint, the English Civil War provided the basis for a major acceleration of enclosures. The parliamentary leaders supported the rights of landlords &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; the King, whose Star Chamber court, abolished in 1641, had provided the primary legal brake on the enclosure process. By dealing an ultimately crippling blow to the monarchy (which, even after the Restoration, no longer posed a significant challenge to enclosures) the Civil War paved the way for the eventual rise to power in the 18th century of what has been called a &quot;committee of Landlords&quot;, a prelude to the UK&#x27;s parliamentary system. After 1650 with the increase in corn prices and the drop in wool prices the focus shifted to implementation of new agricultural techniques, including fertilizer, new crops, and crop rotation, all of which greatly increased the profitability of large-scale farms. The enclosure movement probably peaked from 1760 to 1832; by the latter date it had essentially completed the destruction of the medieval peasant community. Surplus peasant labour moved into the towns to become industrial workers. The enclosure movement is considered by some scholars to be the beginnings of the emergence of capitalism; for many Marxists, the enclosures constituted &quot;primitive accumulation,&quot; establishing the structural conditions necessary for a capitalist political economy.

In contrast to the Hammonds&#x27; 1911 analysis of the events, critically J. D. Chambers and G. E. Mingay, suggested that the Hammonds exaggerated the costs of change when in reality enclosure meant more food for the growing population, more land under cultivation and on balance, more employment in the countryside. The ability to enclose land and raise rents certainly made the enterprise more profitable. 


Arnold Toynbee considered that the main feature distinguishing English agriculture was the massive reduction in common land between the middle of the 18th to the middle of the 19th century.

The major advantages of the enclosures were:
*Effective crop rotation;
*Saving of time in travelling between dispersed fields; and
*The ending of constant quarrels over boundaries and rights of pasture in the meadows and stubbles. 
He writes: &quot;The result was a great increase in agricultural produce. The landowners having separated their plots from those of their neighbours and having consolidated them could pursue any method of tillage they preferred. Alternate and convertible husbandry … came in. The manure of the cattle enriched the arable land and grass crops on the ploughed-up and manured land were much better than were those on the constant pasture.&quot;

Since the late 20th century, those contentions have been challenged by a new class of historians. The Enclosure movement has been seen by some as causing the destruction of the traditional peasant way of life, however miserable. Landless peasants could no longer maintain an economic independence so had to become labourers. Historians and economists such as M.E.Turner and D. McCloskey have examined the available contemporary data and concluded that the difference in efficiency between the open field system and enclosure is not so plain and obvious.
==Social unrest==
===Enclosure riots===
After the Black Death, during the 14th to 17th centuries, landowners started to convert arable land over to sheep, with legal support from the Statute of Merton of 1235. Villages were depopulated. The peasantry responded with a series of revolts. In the 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt, enclosure was one of the side issues. However, in Jack Cade&#x27;s rebellion of 1450 land rights were a prominent demand and by the time of Kett&#x27;s Rebellion of 1549 enclosure was a main issue, as it was in the Captain Pouch revolts of 1604-1607 when the terms &quot;leveller&quot; and &quot;digger&quot; appeared, referring to those who levelled the ditches and fences erected by enclosers.

D. C. Coleman writes that &quot;many troubles arose over the loss of common rights&quot; with resentment and hardship coming from various channels including the &quot;loss of ancient rights in the woodlands to cut underwood, to run pigs&quot;.

The protests against enclosure were not just confined to the countryside. Enclosure riots also occurred in towns and cities across England in the late 15th and early 16th century. The urban unrest was distributed across the whole of the country from York in the north, to Southampton in the south and Gloucester in the west, to Colchester in the east. The urban rioters were not necessarily agricultural workers but consisted of artisanal workers such as butchers, shoemakers,
plumbers, clothmakers, millers, weavers, glovers, shearmen, barbers, cappers, tanners and glaziers.

====Midland Revolt====

In May and June 1607 the villages of Cotesbach (Leicestershire); Ladbroke, Hillmorton and Chilvers Coton (Warwickshire); and Haselbech, Rushton and Pytchley (Northamptonshire) saw protests against enclosures and depopulation. The rioting that took place became known as the Midland Revolt and drew considerable popular support from the local people. It was led by John Reynolds, otherwise known as &#x27;Captain Pouch&#x27; who was thought to be an itinerant pedlar or tinker, by trade, and said to have originated from Desborough, Northamptonshire. He told the protesters he had authority from the King and the Lord of Heaven to destroy enclosures and promised to protect protesters by the contents of his pouch, carried by his side, which he said would keep them from all harm (after he was captured, his pouch was opened; all that was in it was a piece of mouldy cheese). A curfew was imposed in the city of Leicester, as it was feared citizens would stream out of the city to join the riots. A gibbet was erected in Leicester as a warning, and was pulled down by the citizens.

====Newton Rebellion: 8 June 1607====

The Newton Rebellion was one of the last times that the non-mining commoners of England and the gentry were in open, armed conflict. Things had come to a head in early June. James I issued a proclamation and ordered his deputy lieutenants in Northamptonshire to put down the riots. It is recorded that women and children were part of the protest. Over a thousand had gathered at Newton, near Kettering, pulling down hedges and filling ditches, to protest against the enclosures of Thomas Tresham.

The Treshams were unpopular for their voracious enclosing of land – the family at Newton and their better-known Roman Catholic cousins at nearby Rushton, the family of Francis Tresham, who had been involved two years earlier in the Gunpowder Plot and had by announcement died in London&#x27;s Tower. Sir Thomas Tresham of Rushton was vilified as &#x27;the most odious man&#x27; in Northamptonshire. The old Roman Catholic gentry family of the Treshams had long argued with the emerging Puritan gentry family, the Montagus of Boughton, about territory. Now Tresham of Newton was enclosing common land – The Brand Common – that had been part of Rockingham Forest.
Edward Montagu, one of the deputy lieutenants, had stood up against enclosure in Parliament some years earlier, but was now placed by the king in the position effectively of defending the Treshams. The local armed bands and militia refused the call-up, so the landowners were forced to use their own servants to suppress the rioters on 8 June 1607. The royal proclamation of King James was read twice. The rioters continued in their actions, although at the second reading some ran away. The gentry and their forces charged. A pitched battle ensued in which 40–50 people were killed; the ringleaders were hanged and quartered. A much-later memorial stone to those killed stands at the former church of St Faith, Newton, Northamptonshire.
The Tresham family declined soon after 1607. The Montagu family went on through marriage to become the Dukes of Buccleuch, enlarging the wealth of the senior branch substantially.

====Western Rising 1630–32 and forest enclosure====

Although royal forests were not technically commons, they were used as such from at least the 1500s onwards. By the 1600s, when Stuart kings examined their estates to find new revenues, it had become necessary to offer compensation to at least some of those using the lands as commons when the forests were divided and enclosed. The majority of the disafforestation took place between 1629 and 1640, during Charles I of England&#x27;s Personal Rule. Most of the beneficiaries were royal courtiers, who paid large sums to enclose and sublet the forests. Those dispossessed of the commons, especially recent cottagers and those who were outside of tenanted lands belonging to manors, were granted little or no compensation, and rioted in response.
