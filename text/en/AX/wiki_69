<text>John Howard FRS (2 September 1726 – 20 January 1790) was a philanthropist and early English prison reformer.

==Birth and early life==
Howard was born in North London, either in Hackney or Enfield. His father, also John, was a wealthy upholsterer at Smithfield Market in the city. His mother Ann Pettitt, or Cholmley, died when he was five years old, and, described as a &quot;sickly child&quot;, he was sent to live at Cardington, Bedfordshire, some fifty miles from London, where his father owned property. His father, a strict disciplinarian with strong religious beliefs, sent the young John to a school in Hertford run by John Worsley. He went on from there to a dissenting academy run in London by John Eames.

After school, John was apprenticed to a wholesale grocer to learn business methods, but he was unhappy. When his father died in 1742, he was left with a sizeable inheritance but no true vocation, a Calvinist faith and a quiet, serious disposition.

==Early travels==

In 1748, Howard left England for a grand tour of the continent. On his return, he lived in lodgings in Stoke Newington, where he again became seriously ill. He was nursed back to health by his landlady, Sarah Loidore, whom he then married despite her being 30 years older than he was. She died within three years.

Howard then set out for Portugal following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, travelling on the &quot;Hanover&quot;, which was captured by French privateers. He was imprisoned in Brest for six days before being transferred to another prison on the French coast. He was later exchanged for a French officer held by the British, and went to the Commissioners of Sick and Wounded Seamen in London to seek help on behalf of his fellow captives. It is widely believed that this personal experience generated Howard&#x27;s interest in prisons.

==At Cardington==
Having returned from France, he settled again at Cardington, Bedfordshire to live on a estate which was formerly two farms, the larger of which he had inherited from his grandparents. His grandmother, Martha Howard, was a relation of the Whitbread family, and he became a neighbour and close friend of his cousin, Samuel Whitbread. He spent the next two years building properties and trying to improve the lives of the tenants living on his land. Later, a survey of Cardington in 1782 found that he was paying for the teaching of 23 children. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1756.

==Prison visitor==

John Howard was appointed High Sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1774, initially for a one-year period. Rather than delegating his duties to the under-sheriff, Howard inspected the county prison himself. He was shocked by what he found, and spurred into action to inspect prisons throughout England. Of particular concern to Howard were those prisoners who were held because they could not pay the jailer&#x27;s fee – an amount paid to the owner or keeper of the prison for upkeep. He took this issue to parliament, and in 1774 was called to give evidence on prison conditions to a House of Commons select committee. Unusually, Howard was called to the bar of the House of Commons and publicly thanked for his &quot;humanity and zeal&quot;.

Having visited several hundred prisons across England, Scotland, Wales and wider Europe, Howard published the first edition of &quot;The State of the Prisons&quot; in 1777. It included very detailed accounts of the prisons he had visited, including plans and maps, together with detailed instructions on the necessary improvements, especially regarding hygiene and cleanliness, the lack of which was causing many deaths. It is this work that has been credited as establishing the practice of single-celling in the United Kingdom and, by extension, in the United States. Howard&#x27;s views on keeping prisoners in isolation were later unavailingly opposed by Elizabeth Fry, who believed in the value of association. The following account, of the Bridewell at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, is typical:

Two dirty day-rooms; and three offensive night-rooms: That for men eight feet square: one of the women&#x27;s, nine by eight; the other four and a half feet square: the straw, worn to dust, swarmed with vermin: no court: no water accessible to prisoners. The petty offenders were in irons: at my last visit, eight were women.

Howard viewed his work as humanitarian. Terry Carlson, in his 1990 biographical tract on Howard, remarks:

Howard&#x27;s detailed proposals for improvements were designed to enhance the physical and mental health of the prisoners and the security and order of the prison. His recommendations pertaining to such matters as the prison location, plan and furnishings, the provision of adequate water supply, and prisoner&#x27;s diet promoted hygiene and physical health. Recommendations concerning the quality of prison personnel, rules related to the maintenance of standards of health and order and an independent system of inspection, reflect the need for prison personnel to set a moral example.

In April 1777, Howard&#x27;s sister died, leaving him £15,000 and her house. He used this inheritance and the revenue from the sale of her house to further his work on prisons. In 1778, he was again examined by the House of Commons, who were this time inquiring into &quot;hulks&quot;, or prison ships. Two days after giving evidence, he was again travelling Europe, beginning in the Dutch Republic.

By 1784, Howard calculated that he had travelled over visiting prisons. He had been awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Dublin and had been given the Freedom of the City of London. His fourth and final tour of English prisons began in March 1787 and two years later he published &quot;The State of the Prisons in England, and An Account of the Principal Lazarettos of Europe&quot;.

==Death==

Howard&#x27;s final journey took him into Eastern Europe, and to Crimea. Whilst at Kherson, he contracted typhus on a prison visit, and died, aged 63. He was buried in a walled field at Dophinovka (Stepanovka), to the north. Despite his request for a quiet funeral, the event was elaborate and attended by Emanuel Giani Ruset, the Prince of Moldavia, Nikolay Mordvinov, and Admiral John Priestman in the Russian service.

When news of his death reached England in February 1790, a commemorative series of John Howard halfpenny Conder Tokens were struck, including one that circulated in Bath, on the reverse showing &quot;Go forth&quot; and &quot;Remember the Debtors in Gaol&quot;.

John Howard was considered eccentric by many of his contemporaries. It has been advanced by psychiatrist Philip Lucas and by mathematician Ioan Mackenzie James that Howard might have had Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome.

==Family==
In 1758, Howard married as his second wife Henrietta Leeds, daughter of Edward Leeds (died 1758), a barrister. She died in 1765, a week after giving birth to a son, also named John, who was sent to boarding school at a very young age. The younger John was sent down from Cambridge for homosexual offences, was judged insane at the age of 21, and died in 1799 having spent thirteen years in an asylum.

==Awards and honours==
Howard became the first civilian to be honoured with a statue in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. A statue was also erected in Bedford, and a further one in a John Haviland-designed monument in Kherson. His bust features in the architecture of a number of Victorian prisons across the UK, such as at Shrewsbury. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1790.

==Legacy==
===Organisations===
Almost eighty years after his death, the Howard Association was formed in London, with the aim of &quot;promotion of the most efficient means of penal treatment and crime prevention&quot; and to promote &quot;a reformatory and radically preventive treatment of offenders&quot;. In its first annual report in 1867, the Association stated that its efforts had been focused on &quot;the promotion of reformatory and remunerative prison labour, and the abolition of capital punishment.&quot; The Association merged with the Penal Reform League in 1921 to become the Howard League for Penal Reform. Today, the Howard League is Britain&#x27;s biggest penal reform organisation.

John Howard&#x27;s name was adopted by non-profit organizations in Canada which call themselves the John Howard Society of their given geographic area and each society seeks to develop effective, just and humane responses to crime and its consequences. There are currently over 60 John Howard societies spread across every province of Canada and the Northwest Territories.

The Howard Association, a benevolent organisation founded in 1855 in Norfolk, Virginia, United States, was also named after him. There is also a Howard League for Penal Reform in New Zealand. The John Howard Association of Illinois, formed in 1901, independently monitors correctional facilities, policies and practices, and advances reforms needed to achieve a fair, humane and effective criminal justice system in Illinois.

Samford University, located in the US state of Alabama, was founded by Baptists as Howard College in 1841. Samford&#x27;s Howard College of Arts and Sciences remains part of the university.

===Other===

* A statue to Howard is in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, the first to a civilian, and a large bronze statue at Bedford was erected in 1890, the centenary of his death.
* A terracotta bust of John Howard is incorporated in the gatehouse of HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs, and another bust over the entrance to Shrewsbury Prison.
* The John Howard Pavilion at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., is the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital for the District of Columbia. Its most notorious inmate was John Hinckley, Jr., failed assassin of then US president Ronald Wilson Reagan in 1981.
* The John Howard School in Clapton, London (now Clapton Girls&#x27; Academy), was named after him.

==Vegetarianism==

Howard was a teetotaller and vegetarian. He became a vegetarian many years before his death. He once commented that in his London house there were &quot;not a dozen joints of meat in seven years.&quot; He lived on a diet of milk, fruit, vegetables, butter, tea and water. As a strict vegetarian Howard had distaste for the luxuries of life. He was fond of tea and carried a kettle on his travels.

Whilst visiting Sweden, Howard found that living on a vegetarian diet was very difficult. This was because few vegetables were eaten in the winter months, and they were almost impossible to obtain. His diet was limited to coarse bread. He attributed his immunity from gaol fever found in filthy prisons that he had visited to his vegetarian diet.

<text>Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541 (1999), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding North Carolina&#x27;s 12th congressional district. In an earlier case, &quot;Shaw v. Reno&quot;, , the Supreme Court ruled that the 12th district of North Carolina as drawn was unconstitutional because it was created for the purpose of placing African Americans in one district, thereby constituting illegal racial gerrymandering. The Court ordered the state of North Carolina to redraw the boundaries of the district.

The redrawn 12th district boundaries were then thrown out in a summary judgment by a three judge panel in Eastern District of North Carolina. When appealed to the Supreme Court, Justice Thomas wrote for all nine justices saying that the District Court erred in granting summary judgement, while Justice Stevens concurred in an opinion indicating that he and three other justices would have upheld the 12th district as a legal partisan gerrymander. After the case was sent back down, the District Court after a three-day trial again found that the 12th district was an illegal racial gerrymander, resulting in another Supreme Court appeal and the ruling &quot;Easley v. Cromartie&quot;, . (Mike Easley replaced Jim Hunt as Governor of North Carolina, resulting in the change of name.) In &quot;Easley v. Cromartie&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that the state was able to justify the new boundaries of the 12th district by showing that it was intended to create a safe seat for Democrats, and therefore the redrawn district was a constitutional example of political gerrymandering. Justice O&#x27;Connor acted as the swing vote, satisfied with the change in reasoning since &quot;Shaw v. Reno,&quot; despite not joining Justice Stevens&#x27; concurrence in the 1999 case.

<text>Ephedrine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and sympathomimetic agent that is often used to prevent low blood pressure during anesthesia. It has also been used for asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity but is not the preferred treatment. It is of unclear benefit in nasal congestion. It can be taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle, vein, or just under the skin. Onset with intravenous use is fast, while injection into a muscle can take 20minutes, and by mouth can take an hour for effect. When given by injection, it lasts about an hour, and when taken by mouth, it can last up to four hours.
Common side effects include trouble sleeping, anxiety, headache, hallucinations, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, loss of appetite, and urinary retention. Serious side effects include stroke and heart attack. While probably safe in pregnancy, its use in this population is poorly studied. Use during breastfeeding is not recommended. Ephedrine works by inducing the release of norepinephrine and hence indirectly activating the α- and β-adrenergic receptors. Chemically, ephedrine is a substituted amphetamine and is the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer of β-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methylamphetamine.
Ephedrine was first isolated in 1885 and came into commercial use in 1926. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. It can normally be found in plants of the &quot;Ephedra&quot; genus. Over-the-counter dietary supplements containing ephedrine are illegal in the United States, with the exception of those used in traditional Chinese medicine, where its presence is noted by &quot;má huáng&quot;.

==Medical uses==
Ephedrine is a non-catecholamine sympathomimetic with cardiovascular effects similar to those of adrenaline/epinephrine: increased blood pressure, heart rate, and contractility. Like pseudoephedrine it is a bronchodilator, with pseudoephedrine having considerably less effect.

Ephedrine may decrease motion sickness, but it has mainly been used to decrease the sedating effects of other medications used for motion sickness.

Ephedrine is also found to have quick and long-lasting responsiveness in congenital myasthenic syndrome in early childhood and also even in adults with a novel COLQ mutation.

Ephedrine is administered by intravenous boluses. Redosing usually requires increased doses to offset the development of tachyphylaxis, which is attributed to the depletion of catecholamine stores.

===Weight loss===
Ephedrine promotes modest short-term weight loss, specifically fat loss, but its long-term effects are unknown. In mice, ephedrine is known to stimulate thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue, but because adult humans have only small amounts of brown fat, thermogenesis is assumed to take place mostly in the skeletal muscle. Ephedrine also decreases gastric emptying. Methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline have a synergistic effect with ephedrine for weight loss. This led to the creation and marketing of compound products. One of them, known as the ECA stack, contains ephedrine with caffeine and aspirin. It is a popular supplement taken by bodybuilders seeking to cut body fat before a competition.
A 2021 systematic review found that ephedrine led to a weight loss greater than placebo, raised heart rate, and reduced LDL and raised HDL, with no statistically significant difference in blood pressure.

===Available forms===
Ephedrine is available as a prescription-only pharmaceutical drug in the form of an intravenous solution, under brand names including Akovaz, Corphedra, Emerphed, and Rezipres as well as in generic forms, in the United States. It is also available over-the-counter in the form of 12.5 and 25mg oral tablets for use as a bronchodilator and as a 0.5% concentration nasal spray for use as a decongestant. The drug is additionally available in combination with guaifenesin in the form of oral tablets and liquids. Ephedrine is provided as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt in pharmaceutical formulations.

==Contraindications==
Ephedrine should not be used in conjunction with certain antidepressants, namely norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs), as this increases the risk of symptoms due to excessive serum levels of norepinephrine.

Bupropion is an example of an antidepressant with an amphetamine-like structure similar to ephedrine, and it is an NDRI. Its action bears more resemblance to amphetamine than to fluoxetine in that its primary mode of therapeutic action involves norepinephrine and to a lesser degree dopamine, but it also releases some serotonin from presynaptic clefts. It should not be used with ephedrine, as it may increase the likelihood of side effects.

Ephedrine should be used with caution in patients with inadequate fluid replacement, impaired adrenal function, hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, during delivery if maternal blood pressure is &gt;130/80 mmHg, and during lactation.

Contraindications for the use of ephedrine include: closed-angle glaucoma, phaeochromocytoma, asymmetric septal hypertrophy (idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), concomitant or recent (previous 14 days) monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) therapy, general anaesthesia with halogenated hydrocarbons (particularly halothane), tachyarrhythmias or ventricular fibrillation, or hypersensitivity to ephedrine or other stimulants.

Ephedrine should not be used at any time during pregnancy unless specifically indicated by a qualified physician and only when other options are unavailable.

==Side effects==
Ephedrine is a potentially dangerous natural compound; the US Food and Drug Administration had received over 18,000 reports of adverse effects in people using it.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are more common with systemic administration (e.g. injection or oral administration) compared to topical administration (e.g. nasal instillations). ADRs associated with ephedrine therapy include 

* Cardiovascular: tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, vasoconstriction with hypertension
* Dermatological: flushing, sweating, acne vulgaris
* Gastrointestinal: nausea
* Genitourinary: decreased urination due to vasoconstriction of renal arteries, difficulty urinating is not uncommon, as alpha-agonists such as ephedrine constrict the internal urethral sphincter, mimicking the effects of sympathetic nervous system stimulation
* Nervous system: restlessness, confusion, insomnia, mild euphoria, mania/hallucinations (rare except in previously existing psychiatric conditions), delusions, formication (may be possible, but lacks documented evidence) paranoia, hostility, panic, agitation
* Respiratory: dyspnea, pulmonary edema
* Miscellaneous: dizziness, headache, tremor, hyperglycemic reactions, dry mouth

==Overdose==
Overdose of ephedrine may result in sympathomimetic symptoms like tachycardia and hypertension.

==Interactions==
Ephedrine with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) like phenelzine and tranylcypromine can result in hypertensive crisis.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Ephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine, acts on part of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The principal mechanism of action relies on its indirect stimulation of the adrenergic receptor system by increasing activation of α- and β-adrenergic receptors via induction of norepinephrine release. The presence of direct interactions with α-adrenergic receptors is unlikely but still controversial. -ephedrine, and particularly its stereoisomer norpseudoephedrine (which is also present in &quot;Catha edulis&quot;) has indirect sympathomimetic effects and due to its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, it is a CNS stimulant similar to amphetamines, but less pronounced, as it releases norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
The oral bioavailability of ephedrine is 88%. The onset of action of ephedrine orally is 15 to 60minutes, via intramuscular injection is 10 to 20minutes, and via intravenous infusion is within seconds.

====Distribution====
Its plasma protein binding is approximately 24 to 29%, with 5 to 10% bound to albumin.

====Metabolism====
Ephedrine is largely not metabolized. Norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine) is an active metabolite of ephedrine formed via &quot;N&quot;-demethylation. About 8 to 20% of an oral dose of ephedrine is demethylated into norephedrine, about 4 to 13% is oxidatively deaminated into benzoic acid, and a small fraction is converted into 1,2-dihydroxy-1-phenylpropane.

====Elimination====
Ephedrine is eliminated mainly in urine, with 60% (range 53–79%) excreted unchanged.

The elimination half-life of ephedrine is 6hours. Its duration of action orally is 2 to 4hours and via intravenous or intramuscular injection is 60minutes.

The elimination of ephedrine is dependent on urinary pH.

==Chemistry==
Ephedrine, or (−)-(1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-ephedrine, also known as (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-β-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyl-α-methyl-β-phenethylamine or as (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-β-hydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methylamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is similar in chemical structure to phenylpropanolamine, methamphetamine, and epinephrine (adrenaline). It differs from methamphetamine only by the presence of a hydroxyl group (–OH). Chemically, ephedrine is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus &quot;Ephedra&quot; (family Ephedraceae). It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt.

It has an experimental log P of 1.13, while its predicted log P values range from 0.9 to 1.32. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to ephedrine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of pseudoephedrine is 0.89, of phenylpropanolamine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7).

Ephedrine hydrochloride has a melting point of 187−188°C.

The racemic form of ephedrine is racephedrine ((±)-ephedrine; &quot;dl&quot;-ephedrine; (1&quot;RS&quot;,2&quot;SR&quot;)-ephedrine). A stereoisomer of ephedrine is pseudoephedrine. Derivatives of ephedrine include methylephedrine (&quot;N&quot;-methylephedrine), etafedrine (&quot;N&quot;-ethylephedrine), cinnamedrine (&quot;N&quot;-cinnamylephedrine), and oxilofrine (4-hydroxyephedrine). Analogues of ephedrine include phenylpropanolamine (norephedrine) and metaraminol (3-hydroxynorephedrine).

The presence of an &quot;N&quot;-methyl group decreases binding affinities at α-adrenergic receptors, compared with norephedrine. Ephedrine, though, binds better than &quot;N&quot;-methylephedrine, which has an additional methyl group at the nitrogen atom. Also, the steric orientation of the hydroxyl group is important for receptor binding and functional activity.

===Nomenclature===
Ephedrine exhibits optical isomerism and has two chiral centres, giving rise to four stereoisomers. By convention, the pair of enantiomers with the stereochemistry (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;) and (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;) is designated ephedrine, while the pair of enantiomers with the stereochemistry (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;) and (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;) is called pseudoephedrine.

The isomer which is marketed is (−)-(1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)-ephedrine.

In the outdated / system (+)-ephedrine is also referred to as -ephedrine and (−)-ephedrine as -ephedrine (in which case, in the Fisher projection, the phenyl ring is drawn at the bottom).

Often, the / system (with small caps) and the d/l system (with lower-case) are confused. The result is that the levorotary l-ephedrine is wrongly named -ephedrine and the dextrorotary d-pseudoephedrine (the diastereomer) wrongly -pseudoephedrine.

The IUPAC names of the two enantiomers are (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)- respectively (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-2-methylamino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol. A synonym is &quot;erythro&quot;-ephedrine.

===Detection in body fluids===
Ephedrine may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine to monitor possible abuse by athletes, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial immunoassay screening tests directed at the amphetamines cross-react appreciably with ephedrine, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish ephedrine from other phenethylamine derivatives. Blood or plasma ephedrine concentrations are typically in the 20–200μg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 300–3000μg/L in abusers or poisoned patients, and 3–20mg/L in cases of acute fatal overdosage. The current World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) limit for ephedrine in an athlete&#x27;s urine is 10μg/mL.

==History==
===Asia===
Ephedrine in its natural form, known as &quot;máhuáng&quot; (麻黄) in traditional Chinese medicine, has been documented in China since the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) as an antiasthmatic and stimulant. In traditional Chinese medicine, &quot;máhuáng&quot; has been used as a treatment for asthma and bronchitis for centuries.

In 1885, the chemical synthesis of ephedrine was first accomplished by Japanese organic chemist Nagai Nagayoshi based on his research on traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicines.

The industrial manufacture of ephedrine in China began in the 1920s, when Merck began marketing and selling the drug as ephetonin. Ephedrine exports from China to the West grew from 4 to 216 tonnes between 1926 and 1928.

===Western medicine===
Ephedrine was first introduced for medical use in the United States in 1926.

It was introduced in 1948 in Vicks Vatronol nose drops (now discontinued) which contained ephedrine sulfate as the active ingredient for rapid nasal decongestion.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
&quot;Ephedrine&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its . Its is &quot;ephédrine&quot; while its is &quot;efedrina&quot;. In the case of the hydrochloride salt, its generic name is &quot;ephedrine hydrochloride&quot; and this is its , , and . In the case of the sulfate salt, its generic name is &quot;ephedrine sulfate&quot; or &quot;ephedrine sulphate&quot; and the former is its while the latter is its . A synonym of ephedrine sulfate is &quot;isofedrol&quot;. These names all refer to the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomer of ephedrine. The racemic form of ephedrine is known as &quot;racephedrine&quot; and this is its and , while the hydrochloride salt of the racemic form is &quot;racephedrine hydrochloride&quot; and this is its .

===Recreational use===
As a phenethylamine, ephedrine has a similar chemical structure to amphetamines and is a methamphetamine analog having the methamphetamine structure with a hydroxyl group at the β position. Because of ephedrine&#x27;s structural similarity to methamphetamine, it can be used to create methamphetamine using chemical reduction in which ephedrine&#x27;s hydroxyl group is removed; this has made ephedrine a highly sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.

The most popular method for reducing ephedrine to methamphetamine is similar to the Birch reduction, in that it uses anhydrous ammonia and lithium metal in the reaction. The second-most popular method uses red phosphorus and iodine in the reaction with ephedrine. Moreover, ephedrine can be synthesized into methcathinone via simple oxidation. As such, ephedrine is listed as a table-I precursor under the &quot;United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances&quot;.

===Use in exercise and sports===
Ephedrine has been used as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports. It can increase heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility as well as act as a psychostimulant. Ephedrine is often used in combination with caffeine for performance-enhancing purposes.

===Other uses===
In chemical synthesis, ephedrine is used in bulk quantities as a chiral auxiliary group.

In saquinavir synthesis, the half-acid is resolved as its salt with l-ephedrine.

===Legal status===
====Canada====
In January 2002, Health Canada issued a voluntary recall of all ephedrine products containing more than 8mg per dose, all combinations of ephedrine with other stimulants such as caffeine, and all ephedrine products marketed for weight-loss or bodybuilding indications, citing a serious risk to health. Ephedrine is still sold as an oral nasal decongestant in 8mg pills as a natural health product, with a limit of 0.4g (400mg) per package, the limit established by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as it is considered as Class A Precursor.

====United States====
In 1997, the FDA proposed a regulation on ephedra (the herb from which ephedrine is obtained), which limited an ephedra dose to 8mg (of active ephedrine) with no more than 24mg per day. This proposed rule was withdrawn, in part, in 2000 because of &quot;concerns regarding the agency&#x27;s basis for proposing a certain dietary ingredient level and a duration of use limit for these products.&quot; In 2004, the FDA created a ban on ephedrine alkaloids marketed for reasons other than asthma, colds, allergies, other disease, or traditional Asian use. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah ruled the FDA did not have proper evidence that low dosages of ephedrine alkaloids are actually unsafe, but on August 17, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver upheld the FDA&#x27;s final rule declaring all dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids adulterated, and therefore illegal for marketing in the United States. Furthermore, ephedrine is banned by the NCAA, MLB, NFL, and PGA. Ephedrine is, however, still legal in many applications outside of dietary supplements. Purchasing is currently limited and monitored, with specifics varying from state to state.

The House passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 as an amendment to the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act. Signed into law by President George W. Bush on March 6, 2006, the act amended the US Code (21 USC 830) concerning the sale of products containing ephedrine and the closely related drug pseudoephedrine. Both substances are used as precursors in the illicit production of methamphetamine, and to discourage that use the federal statute included the following requirements for merchants who sell these products:

* A retrievable record of all purchases identifying the name and address of each party to be kept for two years
* Required verification of proof of identity of all purchasers
* Required protection and disclosure methods in the collection of personal information
* Reports to the Attorney General of any suspicious payments or disappearances of the regulated products
* Non-liquid dose form of regulated product may only be sold in unit-dose blister packs
* Regulated products are to be sold behind the counter or in a locked cabinet in such a way as to restrict access
* Daily sales of regulated products not to exceed 3.6g to a single purchaser, without regard to the number of transactions
* Monthly sales to a single purchaser not to exceed 9g of pseudoephedrine base in regulated products

The law gives similar regulations to mail-order purchases, except the monthly sales limit is 7.5g.

As a pure herb or tea, &quot;má huáng&quot;, containing ephedrine, is still sold legally in the US. The law restricts/prohibits its being sold as a dietary supplement (pill) or as an ingredient/additive to other products, like diet pills.

====Australia====
Ephedrine and all &quot;Ephedra&quot; species that contain it are considered Schedule 4 substances under the Poisons Standard. A Schedule 4 drug is considered a Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription under the Poisons Standard.

====South Africa====
In South Africa, ephedrine was moved to schedule 6 on 27 May 2008, which makes pure ephedrine tablets prescription only. Pills containing ephedrine up to 30 mg per tablet in combination with other medications are still available OTC, schedule 1 and 2, for sinus, head colds, and influenza.

====Germany====
Ephedrine was freely available in pharmacies in Germany until 2001. Afterward, access was restricted since it was mostly bought for unindicated uses. Similarly, ephedra can only be bought with a prescription. Since April 2006, all products, including plant parts, that contain ephedrine are only available with a prescription.

==Sources==
===Agricultural===
Ephedrine is obtained from the plant &quot;Ephedra sinica&quot; and other members of the genus &quot;Ephedra,&quot; from which the name of the substance is derived. Raw materials for the manufacture of ephedrine and traditional Chinese medicines are produced in China on a large scale. As of 2007, companies produced for export US$13 million worth of ephedrine from 30,000 tons of ephedra annually, or about ten times the amount used in traditional Chinese medicine.

===Synthetic===
Most of the l-ephedrine produced today for official medical use is made synthetically as the extraction and isolation process from &quot;E. sinica&quot; is tedious and no longer cost-effective.

===Biosynthetic===
Ephedrine was long thought to come from modifying the amino acid -phenylalanine. -Phenylalanine would be decarboxylated and subsequently attacked with ω-aminoacetophenone. Methylation of this product would then produce ephedrine. This pathway has since been disproven. A new pathway proposed suggests that phenylalanine first forms cinnamoyl-CoA via the enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and acyl CoA ligase. The cinnamoyl-CoA is then reacted with a hydratase to attach the alcohol functional group. The product is then reacted with a retro-aldolase, forming benzaldehyde. Benzaldehyde reacts with pyruvic acid to attach a 2-carbon unit. This product then undergoes transamination and methylation to form ephedrine and its stereoisomer, pseudoephedrine.

<text>Random House is an imprint and publishing group of Penguin Random House. Founded in 1927 by businessmen Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer as an imprint of Modern Library, it quickly overtook Modern Library as the parent imprint. Over the following decades, a series of acquisitions made it into one of the largest publishers in the United States. In 2013, it was merged with Penguin Group to form Penguin Random House, which is owned by the Germany-based media conglomerate Bertelsmann. Penguin Random House uses its brand for Random House Publishing Group and Random House Children&#x27;s Books, as well as several imprints.

==Company history==
===20th century===
Random House was founded in 1927 by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer, two years after they acquired the Modern Library imprint from publisher Horace Liveright, which reprints classic works of literature. Cerf is quoted as saying, &quot;We just said we were going to publish a few books on the side at random&quot;, which suggested the name Random House. 

In 1934, they published the first authorized edition of James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; in the Anglophone world. &quot;Ulysses&quot; transformed Random House into a formidable publisher over the next two decades. In 1936, it acquired Smith and Haas, and Robert Haas became the third partner until retiring and selling his share back to Cerf and Klopfer in 1956. The acquisition of Smith and Haas added authors, including William Faulkner, Isak Dinesen, André Malraux, Robert Graves, and Jean de Brunhoff, who wrote the Babar children&#x27;s books. 

Random House also hired editors Harry Maule, Robert Linscott, and Saxe Commins, and they brought authors such as Sinclair Lewis and Robert Penn Warren with them. Random House entered reference publishing in 1947 with the &quot;American College Dictionary&quot;, which was followed in 1966 by its first unabridged dictionary. 

In October 1959, Random House went public at $11.25 a share. This was a factor in decisions by other publishing companies, including Simon &amp; Schuster, to later go public. American publishers Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. and Beginner Books were acquired by Random House in 1960, followed by Pantheon Books in 1961; works continue to be published under these imprints with editorial independence, such as Everyman&#x27;s Library, a series of classical literature reprints. 

In 1965, RCA bought Random House as part of a diversification strategy. Random House acquired the paperback book publisher Ballantine Books in 1973. RCA sold Random House to Advance Publications in 1980. Random House began publishing audiobooks in 1985. 

In 1988, Random House acquired Crown Publishing Group. Also in 1988, McGraw-Hill acquired Random House&#x27;s Schools and Colleges division. 

In 1998, Bertelsmann AG bought Random House and merged it with Bantam Doubleday Dell and it soon went global. In 1999, Random House acquired the children&#x27;s audiobook publisher Listening Library,and sold its distribution division.
===21st century===
In 2001, Phyllis E. Grann joined Random House as vice chairman. Grann was the CEO for Putnam and had grown that house from $10 million in revenue in 1976, to more than $200 million by 1993 and without increasing their title output. A publishing insider commented that then CEO Peter Olson was, &quot;I think maybe instead of buying a company he bought a person.&quot; 

In 2003, Random House reentered the distribution business. Coinciding with the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the publishing industry was hit hard with weak retail sales. 

In May 2008, Random House CEO Peter Olson stepped down and was replaced by Markus Dohle. 

In October 2008, Doubleday, a division of Random House, announced that they would lay off 16 people, representing approximately 10% of its workforce. 

In early December 2008, which became known as Black Wednesday in publishing circles, many publishers including Random House took steps by restructuring their divisions and laying off employees. 

The reorganization consolidated and created three divisions, including Random House Publishing Group, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, and Crown Publishing Group.

Susan Kamil was named editorial director for Dial Press and editor-in-chief of Random House imprints reporting to Gina Centrello, the president and publisher of the Random House Publishing Group. There were layoffs at Doubleday, now part of Knopf Publishing Group, and Dial Press, Bantam Dell. Spiegel &amp; Grau was moved from Doubleday over to Random House. Random House also has an entertainment production arm for film and television, Random House Studio; which released the film, &quot;One Day&quot; in 2011. The company also creates story content for media including video games, social networks on the web, and mobile platforms. 

Random House is one of the largest English language publishers, and part of a group of publishers once known as the &quot;Big 6&quot; and now known as the &quot;Big Five&quot;. In October 2012, Bertelsmann entered into talks with rival conglomerate Pearson plc, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Random House and Penguin Group. 

On July 1, 2013, the merger was completed, and the new company emerged as Penguin Random House. When founded, Bertelsmann owned 53% of the joint venture while Pearson owned 47%. 

Pearson sold 22% of its shares to Bertelsmann in July 2017, and since April 2020, it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann, making Random House division again wholly owned by German parent. At the time of the acquisition the combined companies controlled 25% of the book business with more than 10,000 employees and 250 independent publishing imprints and with about $3.9 billion in annual revenues. The move to consolidate was to provide leverage against Amazon.com and battle the shrinking state of bookstores. 

In October 2018, Penguin Random House merged two of its most known publishing lines, Random House and the Crown Publishing Group. According to Madeline McIntosh, chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., the two lines &quot;will retain their distinct editorial identities.&quot; McIntosh explained some of the motivation behind the merger in a memo to employees, writing, &quot;Book discovery and buying patterns continue to shift, resulting in growth opportunities in the nonfiction categories in which Crown in particular already has a strong foothold: food, lifestyle, health, wellness, business, and Christian.&quot; &quot;We must invest even more aggressively in title-level and scaled marketing programs, capabilities and partnerships&quot;, she added. 

In 2019, Penguin Random House acquired British children&#x27;s book publisher Little Tiger Group, including Tiger Tales Press, a U.S. subsidiary, and added it to Random House Children&#x27;s Books. Penguin Random House announced an agreement to purchase Boom! Studios in July 2024, where Boom! would become part of Random House Worlds.

== Organization ==
=== Headquarters ===
The publisher&#x27;s main office in the United States is located in Penguin Random House Tower, which was constructed in 2009 at 1745 Broadway in Manhattan. The 684-foot (210 m) building spans the west side of the block between West 55th and West 56th Streets. The building&#x27;s lobby showcases floor-to-ceiling glassed-in bookcases, which are filled with books published by the company and its subsidiaries. 

Prior to moving to Penguin Random House Tower, the company was headquartered at 457 Madison Avenue, 20 East 57th Street, and 201 East 50th Street, all in Manhattan.

=== International branches ===
Random House, Inc. maintains several independently managed subsidiaries around the world.

The Random House Group is one of the largest general book publishing companies in the United Kingdom; it is based in London.

The group comprises nine publishing companies: Cornerstone Publishing, Vintage Publishing, Ebury Publishing, Transworld Publishers, Penguin Random House Children&#x27;s, Penguin Random House UK Audio, Penguin Michael Joseph, Penguin Press, and Penguin General. Its distribution business services its own imprints, as well as 40 other UK publishers through Grantham Book Services.

The Random House archive and library is located in Rushden in Northamptonshire.

In 1989, Century Hutchinson was folded into the British Random House Group, briefly known as Random Century (1990–92), Century became an imprint of the group&#x27;s Cornerstone Publishing.

The Random House Group also operates branches in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa (as a joint venture under the name Random House Struik), and India as part of its overseas structure. In Australia offices are in Sydney and Melbourne. In New Zealand it is based in Glenfield, Auckland, while Random House&#x27;s Indian headquarters are located in New Delhi.

Verlagsgruppe Random House was established after Bertelsmann&#x27;s 1998 acquisition of Random House, grouping its German imprints (until then operating as Verlagsgruppe Bertelsmann) under the new name; before April 2020, it has explicitly no legal part of the worldwide Penguin Random House company and a hundred percent subsidiary of Bertelsmann instead but de facto is led by the same management. It is the second largest book publisher in Germany with more than 40 imprints, including historic publishing houses Goldmann and Heyne Verlag, as well as C. Bertelsmann, the publishing house from which today&#x27;s Bertelsmann SE &amp; Co. KGaA would eventually evolve. Verlagsgruppe Random House is headquartered in Munich (with additional locations in Gütersloh (where Bertelsmann is headquartered), Cologne, and Aßlar), employs about 850 people, and publishes roughly 2,500 titles per year. Following the formation of Penguin Random House, a Penguin Verlag (with no legal connection to Penguin Books) was founded for the German market in 2015, as part of the Verlagsgruppe Random House. With Bertelsmann acquiring full ownership of Penguin Random House in April 2020, Verlagsgruppe Random House is being reintegrated with the main Penguin Random House company and now known as Penguin Random House Verlagsgruppe.

Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial is Random House&#x27;s Spanish-language division, targeting markets in Spain and Hispanic America. It is headquartered in Barcelona with locations in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay, and the United States. From 2001 until November 2012, it was a joint venture with Italian publisher Mondadori (Random House Mondadori). Upon Bertelsmann&#x27;s acquisition of Mondadori&#x27;s stake in the JV, the name was kept temporarily four months. Some Spanish-language authors published by Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial include Roberto Bolaño, Javier Marías, Mario Vargas Llosa and Guillermo Arriaga.

Random House of Canada was established in 1944 as the Canadian distributor of Random House Books. In 1986, Random House of Canada established its own indigenous Canadian publishing program that has become one of the most successful in Canadian history. Until January 2012, it used to hold a 25% stake in McClelland &amp; Stewart, with the remaining 75% being controlled by the University of Toronto. It is now the sole owner of McClelland &amp; Stewart.

Takeda Random House Japan was founded in May 2003 as a joint venture between Kodansha and Random House. In 2009, Random House discontinued the joint venture. Takeda Random House Japan filed for bankruptcy on December 14, 2012.

In 2006, Random House invested in Random House Korea. In 2010, Random House divested their ownership.

In April 2010, Random House Australia managing director, Margie Seale, was assigned the responsibilities of exploring and evaluating potential business opportunities for the company in Asia.

== Random House Home Video ==
Random House Home Video was a home video unit established by Random House in 1983 as Random House Video until 1988, the publisher of Dr. Seuss&#x27;s books. It was renamed in 1984. Random House&#x27;s home video division was currently the distributor of some shows, such as &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (1986–1994), &quot;The Busy World of Richard Scarry&quot; (1993–2005), &quot;Arthur&quot; (1996–2006), and &quot;The Berenstain Bears&quot;, the original 1985–1987 animated television series (1989–2005, 2008–2009), and Golden Books (2001–2005). In 1994, they began distributing through Sony Wonder. Random House Home Video became dormant around 2005, but Sony Wonder still continued to use Random House Home Video&#x27;s logo on Arthur VHS tapes and DVDs until 2006.

<text>A media proprietor, also called a media executive, media mogul, media tycoon, or press baron is an entrepreneur who controls any means of public or commercial mass media, through the personal ownership or holding of a dominant position within a media conglomerate or enterprise. Those with significant control of a large media-based forum may also be called a business magnate. Since the advent of social media, influencers and entertainers who have garnered large followings on platforms have also been considered media proprietors.

==History==
In the United States, newspaper proprietors first became prominent in the 19th century with the development of mass circulation newspapers. In the 20th century, proprietorship expanded to include ownership of radio and television networks, as well as film studios, publishing houses, online platforms, and other forms of multimedia companies. Reflecting this, the term &quot;press baron&quot; was replaced by &quot;media baron&quot; and the term &quot;media mogul&quot; (or &quot;Hollywood mogul&quot; when applied to people specifically working in the American film industry) was popularized in colloquial English. Media proprietors are likely to claim that their publications are editorially independent and unbiased, but this is often questioned. Social networking services such as Facebook are sometimes considered media companies due to their widespread influence.

<text>Richard Jordan Gatling (September 12, 1818 – February 26, 1903) was an American inventor. He is best known for having invented the Gatling gun, which is considered to be the first successful machine gun.

==Life==
Gatling was born in Hertford County, North Carolina in 1818 and raised Methodist. At the age of 21, Gatling created a screw propeller for steamboats, without realizing that one had been patented just months beforehand by John Ericsson. While living in North Carolina, he worked in the county clerk’s office, taught school briefly, and became a merchant. At the age of 36, Gatling moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he worked in a dry goods store and invented a rice-sowing machine and a wheat drill (a machine to aid planting wheat). The introduction of these machines did much to revolutionize the agricultural system in the country.
After an attack of smallpox, Gatling became interested in medicine. He graduated from the Ohio Medical College in 1850 with an MD. Although he had his MD, he never practiced; he was more interested in a career as an inventor.

At the outbreak of the Civil War, Gatling was living in Indianapolis, Indiana. There he devoted himself to the perfection of firearms. In 1861, the same year the war started, he invented the Gatling gun. A year later, he founded the Gatling Gun Company.

By the early 1850s, Gatling was successful enough in business to offer marriage to Jemima Sanders, 19 years younger than Gatling and the daughter of a prominent Indianapolis physician. They married on October 25, 1854. Her older sister Zerelda was married to David Wallace, the governor of Indiana. An active member of his Masonic lodge, he was member of Center Lodge No. 23.

Later in his life, Gatling patented inventions to improve toilets, bicycles, steam-cleaning of raw wool, pneumatic power, and many other fields. He was elected as the first president of the American Association of Inventors and Manufacturers in 1891, serving for six years. Although still quite wealthy at the time of his death, he made and lost several fortunes by his investments.

In his final years, Gatling moved back to St. Louis, Missouri, to form a new company for manufacturing his steam plows, or tractors. While in New York City to visit his daughter and to talk with his patent agency, Gatling died at his daughter&#x27;s home on February 26, 1903. He is interred at the Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis.

His contributions were commemorated by the U.S. Navy during World War II when the &quot;Fletcher&quot; Class Destroyer DD-671 was christened the USS &quot;Gatling&quot;.

==Inventions==
While being most known for inventing the Gatling gun, Gatling invented and patented a number of other inventions. His inventions include a screw propeller and a wheat drill (a planting device) in 1839, a hemp break machine in 1850, a steam plow (steam tractor) in 1857, the Gatling gun in 1861, a marine steam ram in 1862, and a motor-driven plow (tractor).

===Gatling gun===
Gatling invented the Gatling gun after he noticed that a majority of the soldiers fighting in the Civil War were lost to disease rather than gunshots. In 1877, he wrote, &quot;It occurred to me that if I could invent a machine gun which could by its rapidity of fire, enable one man to do as much battle duty as a hundred, that it would, to a large extent supersede the necessity of large armies, and consequently, exposure to battle and disease would be greatly diminished.&quot;

The gun was based on Gatling&#x27;s seed planter. A working prototype was developed in 1861. In 1862, he founded the Gatling Gun Company in Indianapolis, Indiana to market the gun. The first six production guns were destroyed during a fire in December 1862 at the factory. All six of them had been manufactured at Gatling&#x27;s expense. Undaunted, Gatling arranged for another thirteen to be manufactured at the Cincinnati Type Factory. Although the gun was developed during the Civil War, it saw very little action. This is partly because Gatling was accused of being a copperhead because of his North Carolina roots, but this was never proven. Gatling was never affiliated with the Confederate States government or military, nor did he live in the South during the Civil War.

General Benjamin F. Butler bought 12 and Admiral David Dixon Porter bought one, it was not until 1866 that the US Government officially purchased Gatling guns. In 1870, he sold his patents for the Gatling gun to Colt. Gatling remained president of the Gatling Gun Company until it was fully absorbed by Colt in 1897. In 1893, Gatling patented a Gatling gun that replaced the hand cranked mechanism with an electric motor, a relatively new invention at the time, achieving a rate of fire of 3,000 rounds per minute. The hand-cranked Gatling gun was declared obsolete by the United States Army in 1911. Decades later, the mechanical concept was resurrected and wedded to electrically-driven cranking in the M61 Vulcan. That cannon has given rise to numerous variations scaled up to as high as 37 mm and down to 5.56 mm calibers offering versions that are gas-operated as well.

<text>Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234 (2001), is an appeal of the United States Supreme Court case &quot;Hunt v. Cromartie&quot;. The case defendant is Mike Easley, who became North Carolina governor following Jim Hunt. The court&#x27;s ruling on April 18, 2001, stated that redistricting for political reasons did not violate Federal Civil Rights Law banning race-based gerrymandering. (Case No. 99-1864).

The issue facing this Supreme Court case was Constitutional validity of the Congressional Districts in North Carolina. Specifically, the 12th district which cut through the southwestern portion of the state. The complaint of the plaintiff and North Carolina citizens was that the drawing of the district violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution as the district was drawn primarily amongst racial considerations.

The justification of the court stated that in North Carolina, race and politics are strongly correlated. The district may be majority African American, however, Southern Blacks have strong tendencies to vote Democrat. Voter registrations were used as evidence to prove to the court that the redistricting which drew the 12th district were arguably based on political reasons. In the majority opinion, Stephen G Breyer says &quot;the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles&quot;, and in this case, the plaintiffs were not able to make this argument compelling.

Justice O&#x27;Connor previously sided with the district courts in &quot;Hunt v Cromartie,&quot; however, this instance ruled with the North Carolina legislature, acting as the all important swing vote to overturn the previous decision 5–4. The allegedly odd-shaped district was allowed to stand.

<doc id="182966" wikidata="Q201303" url="?curid=182966" title="Tigranes the Great">
<text>Tigranes II, more commonly known as Tigranes the Great (&quot;Tigran Mets&quot; in Armenian; 140–55 BC), was a king of Armenia. A member of the Artaxiad dynasty, he ruled from 95 BC to 55 BC. Under his reign, the Armenian kingdom expanded beyond its traditional boundaries and reached its peak, allowing Tigranes to claim the title Great King or King of Kings. His empire for a short time was the most powerful state to the east of the Roman Republic. The appearance of Halley&#x27;s comet during his reign,
as depicted on the rare series of Tigranes&#x27;s coins, was seen as an auspicious sign.

Either the son or nephew of Artavasdes I, Tigranes was given as a hostage to Mithridates II of Parthia after Armenia came under Parthian suzerainty. After ascending to the Armenian throne, he rapidly expanded his kingdom by invading or annexing Roman and Parthian client-kingdoms. Tigran decided to ally with Mithridates VI of Pontus by marrying his daughter Cleopatra. At its height, Tigranes&#x27; empire stretched from the Pontic Alps to Mesopotamia and from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean. With captured vassals, his lands even reached the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were forcibly relocated to his new capital, Tigranocerta. An admirer of the Greek culture, Tigranes invited many Greek rhetoricians and philosophers to his court, and his capital was noted for its Hellenistic architecture.

Armenia came into direct conflict with Rome after Mithridates VI was forced to seek refuge in Tigranes&#x27; court. In 69 BC, Tigranes was decisively defeated at the Battle of Tigranocerta by a Roman army under the command of Lucullus, and a year later he met another major defeat at Artaxata, the old Armenian capital. The recall of Lucullus gave Tigranes a brief respite, but in 66 BC Armenia faced another Roman invasion led by Pompey, aided by Tigranes&#x27; own son, Tigranes the Younger. Tigranes chose to surrender and was allowed to retain the heartland of his kingdom as a Roman buffer state, while all of his conquests were annexed. He continued to rule Armenia as a client-king of Rome until his death around 55 BC at the age of 85.

==Early years==
In approximately 120 BC, the Parthian king Mithridates II () invaded Armenia and made its king Artavasdes I acknowledge Parthian suzerainty. Artavasdes I was forced to give the Parthians Tigranes, who was either his son or nephew, as a hostage. Tigranes lived in the Parthian court at Ctesiphon, where he was schooled in Parthian culture. Tigranes remained a hostage at the Parthian court until , when Mithridates II released him and appointed him as the king of Armenia. Tigranes ceded an area called &quot;seventy valleys&quot; in the Caspiane to Mithridates II, either as a pledge or because Mithridates II demanded it. Tigranes&#x27; daughter Ariazate had also married a son of Mithridates II, which has been suggested by the modern historian Edward Dąbrowa to have taken place shortly before he ascended the Armenian throne as a guarantee of his loyalty. Tigranes would remain a Parthian vassal until the late 80s BC.

When he came to power, the foundation upon which Tigranes was to build his Empire was already in place, a legacy of the founder of the Artaxiad dynasty, Artaxias I, and subsequent kings. The mountains of Armenia, however, formed natural borders between the different regions of the country and as a result, the feudalistic &quot;nakharars&quot; had significant influence over the regions or provinces in which they were based. This did not suit Tigranes, who wanted to create a centralized empire. He thus proceeded by consolidating his power within Armenia before embarking on his campaign.

He deposed Artanes, the last king of the Kingdom of Sophene and a descendant of Zariadres.

==Alliance with Pontus==

During the First Mithridatic War (89–85 BC), Tigranes supported Mithridates VI of Pontus, but was careful not to become directly involved in the war.

He rapidly built up his power and established an alliance with Mithridates VI, marrying his daughter Cleopatra. Tigranes agreed to extend his influence in the East, while Mithridates set to conquer Roman land in Asia Minor and in Europe. By creating a stronger Hellenistic state, Mithridates was to contend with the well-established Roman foothold in Europe. Mithridates executed a planned general attack on Romans and Italians in Asia Minor, tapping into local discontent with the Romans and their taxes and urging the peoples of Asia Minor to raise against foreign influence. The slaughter of 80,000 people in the province of Asia Minor was known as the Asiatic Vespers. The two kings&#x27; attempts to control Cappadocia and then the massacres resulted in guaranteed Roman intervention. The senate decided that Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who was then one of the consuls, would command the army against Mithridates.

René Grousset remarked that in their alliance Mithridates was somewhat subservient to Tigranes.

== Wars against Roman and Parthian client kingdoms ==

After the death of Mithridates II of Parthia his son Gotarzes I succeeded him. This was disputed by Sinatruces which caused a Parthian civil war. Tigranes, with Rome involved in a Social War and Parthia involved in a succession dispute, quickly invaded Cappadocia but was forced out by the Roman consul Sulla. Between 88 and 85 BC, he retook Adiabene, Gordyene, and Media Atropatene.

In 83 BC, after bloody strife for the throne of Syria, governed by the Seleucids, the Syrians decided to choose Tigranes as the protector of their kingdom and offered him the crown of Syria. Magadates was appointed as his governor in Antioch. He then conquered Phoenicia and Cilicia, effectively putting an end to the last remnants of the Seleucid Empire, though a few holdout cities appear to have recognized the shadowy boy-king Seleucus VII Philometor as the legitimate king during his reign. The southern border of his domain reached as far as Ptolemais (modern Akko). Many of the inhabitants of conquered cities were sent to his new metropolis of Tigranocerta.

At its height, his empire extended from the Pontic Alps (in modern north-eastern Turkey) to Mesopotamia, and from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean. A series of victories led him to assume the Achaemenid title of King of Kings, which was contemporaneously being used by the Parthian kings, appearing on coins struck after 85 BC. He was called &quot;Tigranes the Great&quot; by many Western historians and writers, such as Plutarch. The &quot;King of Kings&quot; never appeared in public without having four kings attending him. Cicero, referring to his success in the east, said that he &quot;made the Republic of Rome tremble before the prowess of his arms.&quot;


==Wars against Rome==

Mithridates VI of Pontus had found refuge in Armenian land after confronting Rome, considering the fact that Tigranes was his ally and relative. The King of Kings eventually came into direct contact with Rome. The Roman commander, Lucullus, demanded the expulsion of Mithridates from Armenia – to comply with such a demand would be, in effect, to accept the status of vassal to Rome and thus Tigranes refused. Charles Rollin, in his &quot;Ancient History&quot;, says:
Lucullus&#x27; reaction was an attack that was so precipitate that he took Tigranes by surprise. According to Roman historians Mithrobazanes, one of Tigranes&#x27; generals, told Tigranes of the Roman approach. Tigranes was, according to Keaveney, so impressed by Mithrobazanes&#x27; courage that he appointed Mithrobazanes to command an army against Lucullus – Tigranes sent Mithrobarzanes with 2,000 to 3,000 cavalry to expel the invader. Mithrobarzanes charged the Romans while they were setting up their camp, but was met by a 3,500-strong sentry force and his horsemen were routed. He perished in the attempt. After this defeat, Tigranes withdrew north to Armenia to regroup, leaving Lucullus free to besiege Tigranocerta.

When Tigranes had gathered a large army, he returned to confront Lucullus. On October 6, 69 BC, Tigranes&#x27; much larger force was decisively defeated by the Roman army under Lucullus in the Battle of Tigranocerta. Tigranes&#x27; treatment of the inhabitants (the majority of the population had been forced to move to the city) led disgruntled city guards to open the gates of the city to the Romans. Learning of this, Tigranes hurriedly sent 6000 cavalrymen to the city in order to rescue his wives and some of his assets. Tigranes escaped capture with a small escort.

On October 6, 68 BC, the Romans approached the old capital of Artaxata. Tigranes&#x27; and Mithridates&#x27; combined Armeno-Pontic army of 70,000 men formed up to face them but were resoundingly defeated. Once again, both Mithridates and Tigranes evaded capture by the victorious Romans.

The long campaigning and hardships that Lucullus&#x27; troops had endured for years, combined with a perceived lack of reward in the form of plunder, led to successive mutinies among the legions in 68–67. Frustrated by the rough terrain of Northern Armenia and seeing the worsening morale of his troops, Lucullus moved back south and put Nisibis under siege. Tigranes concluded (wrongly) that Nisibis would hold out and sought to regain those parts of Armenia that the Romans had captured. Despite his continuous success in battle, Lucullus could still not capture either one of the monarchs. With Lucullus&#x27; troops now refusing to obey his commands, but agreeing to defend positions from attack, the Senate sent Pompey to recall Lucullus to Rome and take over his command.

==Pompey and submission to Rome==

In 67 BC Pompey was given the task of defeating Mithridates and Tigranes. Pompey first concentrated on attacking Mithridates while distracting Tigranes by engineering a Parthian attack on Gordyene. Phraates III, the Parthian king, was soon persuaded to take things a little further than an annexation of Gordyene when a son of Tigranes (also named Tigranes) went to join the Parthians and persuaded Phraates to invade Armenia in an attempt to replace the elder Tigranes with the Tigranes the Younger. Tigranes decided not to meet the invasion in the field but instead ensured that his capital, Artaxata, was well defended and withdrew to the hill country. Phraates soon realized that Artaxata would not fall without a protracted siege, the time for which he could not spare due to his fear of plots at home. Once Phraates left, Tigranes came back down from the hills and drove his son from Armenia. The son then fled to Pompey.

In 66 BC, Pompey advanced into Armenia with Tigranes the Younger, and Tigranes, now almost 75 years old, surrendered. Pompey allowed him to retain his kingdom shorn of his conquests as he planned to have Armenia as a buffer state and he took 6,000 talents/180 tonnes of silver. His unfaithful son was sent back to Rome as a prisoner.

Tigranes continued to rule Armenia as a client-king of Rome. He died in 55/54, at age 85. He is mentioned in &quot;Macrobii&quot;, a Roman essay detailing the famous long-livers of the day attributed to Lucian.

==Issue==
Tigranes had four sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Zariadres, according to Appian and Valerius Maximus rebelled against Tigranes and was killed during a battle (possibly late 90s BCE). Appian also mentions an unnamed younger son who was executed for conspiring against Tigranes: he disregarded his father&#x27;s health and wore Tigranes&#x27;s crown (Tigranes having been injured during a hunting accident). His third son, Tigranes the Younger, who showed great care for his injured father and was rewarded for his loyalty, has already been mentioned. He is also alleged to have led a military campaign in 82 BCE. Tigranes was succeeded by his fourth and youngest son, Artavasdes II.

One daughter of Tigranes according to Cassius Dio married Mithridates I of Atropatene. Another daughter married Parthian prince Pacorus, son of Orodes II. Parchments of Avroman also mention his third daughter, Ariazate &quot;Automa&quot;, who married Gotarzes I of Parthia.

Although Cleopatra of Pontus is usually considered to be their mother (Appian writes that she gave birth to three sons), historian Gagik Sargsyan considered only Artavasdes II and one of the unnamed daughters to be her children. According to him, the rest had a different mother and were born before Tigranes became king. The reasoning behind it is that if Tigranes the Younger did indeed lead a campaign in 82 BCE, then he and hence his two older brothers (and possibly two sisters) would be too old to be Cleopatra&#x27;s children. Another argument supporting this claim would be the situation with Ariazate. As she was probably the mother of Orodes I (), then Ariazate could not have been the daughter of Cleopatra who married Tigranes only in 94 BCE at the age of 15 or 16. Sargsyan also proposed a possible candidate as Tigranes&#x27;s first wife and the children&#x27;s mother: Artaxiad princess Zaruhi, a daughter of Tigranes&#x27;s paternal uncle Zariadres and granddaughter of Artaxias I. He also considered likely that the reason for the rebellion of Tigranes&#x27;s son Zariadres was the birth of Artavasdes who was declared the heir by virtue of being born to a king and not a prince.

== Imperial ideology ==
Tigranes is a typical example of the mixed culture of his period. The ceremonial of his court was of Achaemenid origin, and also incorporated Parthian aspects. He had Greek rhetoricians and philosophers in his court, possibly as a result of the influence of his queen, Cleopatra. Greek was also possibly spoken in the court. Following the example of the Parthians, Tigranes adopted the title of &quot;Philhellene&quot; (&quot;friend of the Greeks&quot;). The layout of his capital Tigranocerta was a blend of Greek and Iranian architecture.

Like the majority Armenia&#x27;s inhabitants, Tigranes was a follower of Zoroastrianism. On his crown, a star of divinity and two birds of prey are displayed, both Iranian aspects. The bird of prey was associated with the &quot;khvarenah&quot;, i.e. kingly glory. It was possibly also a symbol of the bird of the deity Verethragna.

==Coinage==
David Marshall Lang noted that his &quot;magnificent&quot; silver coinage is the best known variety of national coinage of Greater Armenia and the &quot;finest ever struck by an Armenian monarch&quot;.

Tigranes&#x27; coins consist of tetradrachms and copper coins having on the obverse his portrait wearing a decorated Armenian tiara with ear-flaps. The reverse has a completely original design. There are the seated Tyche of Antioch and the river god Orontes at her feet.
==Legacy and recognition==
===Historical assessment===
Tigranes has long been recognized as the greatest of Armenian monarchs. At its peak, his empire covered a territory of with a multi-ethnic population estimated at ten million. He is the sole ruler in history under whom the entire Armenian plateau (and all Armenian-inhabited lands) was unified under a single native ruler. Robert H. Hewsen noted, however, that he did not add Lesser Armenia to his kingdom, which remained under the control of Mithradates. The preeminent early Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi called him the &quot;most powerful and intelligent and the most valiant&quot; of all Armenian kings. &quot;He was supreme among men and by showing his valor he glorified our nation.&quot; In Armenian folk tradition, he was identified with the Iranian hero Fereydun (Thraetaona), the slayer of the dragon Azhi Dahaka. Nina Garsoïan argued that his Greek-speaking court, the Hellenistic capital of Tigranocerta, and handsome coinage marked the &quot;high-water mark of Hellenic influence in Armenia.&quot;

Compared to Mithridates Eupator, Tigranes was marginalized by Roman sources. In one exception, Velleius Paterculus (2.33.1) introduced Tigranes as &quot;the most important of the kings&quot; (&quot;regum maximum&quot;). Western scholarship has largely adopted the Roman bias against Tigranes. Théodore Reinach considered Tigranes a coward and an opportunist. On the contrary, René Grousset praised him as &quot;a great yet underrated monarch who undoubtedly deserves much more admiration from history&quot; than Mithridates, who brought about the downfall of his empire, while &quot;Tigranes ensured the survival of his people for eternity.&quot; The memory of his empire vanished swiftly. Theo van Lint argued that while he was not able to consolidate his territorial gains, the forty year peace he established had the &quot;important effect of developing Greater Armenia and the network of clan relationships that would prove crucial for the preservation of Armenian identity in subsequent periods.&quot; Vahan Hovhannisyan similarly argued that he turned the Armenian people into a nation, which &quot;survived for 500 years with the momentum he provided.&quot;

The historian Leo believed that while he established complete national independence, Tigranes behaved like an &quot;Asian despot&quot; and &quot;arrogance blinded him.&quot; Leo was dismissive of what he saw as the long-gone legacy of Tigranes, contrasting it with the persistent legacy of the Armenian alphabet invented by Mesrop Mashtots. Hewsen argued that his short-lived empire was &quot;not all that historically significant&quot; and found it &quot;inappropriate to glorify the activities of an Armenian conqueror whose treatment of his subjects (e.g., deporting them by the thousands from their homes to populate his new capital) is considered to be reprehensible by Armenian historians when they see it inflicted upon the Armenians themselves.&quot;

===Armenian nationalism===
His empire is often popularly called &quot;sea to sea Armenia&quot; (, &quot;tsovits tsov Hayastan&quot;) as it extended from the Caspian to the Mediterranean Sea. He has been a source of pride for modern Armenian nationalists, with his &quot;sea to sea&quot; empire serving as an inspiration for the most maximalist claims of contemporary Armenian nationalism. George Bournoutian noted that Armenians &quot;revere&quot; Tigranes and sometimes &quot;endow him with modern nationalistic traits and ignore the fact that Tigranes possessed a more Hellenistic and, occasionally, Persian, outlook, rather than that of a modern Armenian.&quot; Eric Hobsbawm suggested that modern Armenian nationalists, in an effort to find a &quot;suitable (and suitably impressive) national state in the past&quot;, had to go back to the times of Tigranes in the first century BC, when the &quot;last sufficiently important kingdom is to be found.&quot;

===In European culture===
In &quot;The Art of War&quot; (1521), Niccolò Machiavelli attributes Tigranes&#x27; military failure to his excessive reliance on his cavalry.

In the modern period, Tigranes has appeared in European culture. He is portrayed in the 1619 English Renaissance drama &quot;A King and No King&quot; by Beaumont and Fletcher. &quot;King Tigranes at the feet of a Roman commander Lucullus&quot; () is an etching by Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole.

Approximately two dozen operas composed by Italian and German composers during the 18th century bear the title Tigrane. Some of these were inspired by Tigranes the Great. The most notable are composed by Antonio Vivaldi (1724), Johann Adolph Hasse (1729), and Christoph Willibald Gluck (1743), with librettos by Pietro Antonio Bernardoni for the first and Francesco Silvani for the latter two.

===Modern tributes===
In visual arts, Tigranes has been depicted by Yervand Kochar in 1940 (gouache on paper) and in a 1959 mural crafted by Van Khachatur inside the Matenadaran in Yerevan, symbolizing Armenia&#x27;s Hellenistic period.

His portrait (from coinage) is depicted on 1988 Soviet and 2009 Armenian postage stamps.

In the early 1990s, a major avenue in central Yerevan, called after the October Revolution was renamed after him. He is the only Armenian king to appear on the Armenian currency, specifically on the 500 dram banknote, which was in circulation from 1993 to 2005.

Three statues of Tigranes have been erected in Armenia, including at the President&#x27;s Residence (2000), in Yerevan&#x27;s Nor Nork District (2004), and in the city of Vagharshapat (2016).

The Order of Tigran the Great, established in 2002, is awarded by the president of Armenia &quot;for exceptional services&quot; rendered to the Republic of Armenia.

<text>Carl Adolph Schuricht (; 3 July 18807 January 1967) was a German conductor.

==Life and career==
Schuricht was born in Danzig (Gdańsk), German Empire; his father&#x27;s family had been respected organ-builders. His mother, Amanda Wusinowska, a widow soon after her marriage (Carl&#x27;s father Carl Conrad Schuricht drowned in the Baltic Sea while trying to save a friend, three weeks before he was born), brought up her son alone. His childhood was surrounded by music: &quot;Every Sunday in summer we used to hire three large open carriages and go out into the country. After the picnic we would join in singing choral works by Bach, Handel and Mendelssohn.&quot; He showed a talent for music at an early age, studying piano and violin from the age of six. By eleven he was composing, and continued his academic and musical studies when his mother moved to Berlin, then to Wiesbaden.

At 20 he obtained the post of Korrepetitor at the Stadttheater in Mainz, and two years later won the Kuczynski Foundation prize for composition and a Felix Mendelssohn scholarship. He then returned to Berlin to study piano under Ernst Rudorff and composition with Engelbert Humperdinck, later working under Max Reger in Leipzig, publishing chamber pieces, sonatas and lieder. Attracted by the profession of conductor he undertook tours in Germany conducting operettas, operas, choral societies and symphony concerts. During this time he had the chance to watch at rehearsal and in concert such legendary interpreters as Arthur Nikisch, Felix Weingartner, Ernst von Schuch, Felix Mottl, Hans Richter, Karl Muck and Gustav Mahler.

On 24 May 1906 he heard Frederick Delius&#x27;s &quot;Sea Drift&quot; in Essen with the composer present, and promised to Delius that when he had his own orchestra he would conduct it himself, which he did in Frankfurt with Delius again in the audience. More important was perhaps that at the same Festival in 1906 he heard the premiere of Mahler&#x27;s Sixth Symphony, conducted by the composer. In 1909 he succeeded Siegfried Ochs as director of the Rühlscher Oratorienverein in Frankfurt-am-Main and at 40 was appointed musical director of the municipal orchestra in Wiesbaden; festivals of modern music (Richard Strauss, Reger, Mahler, Delius and Arnold Schoenberg) made Wiesbaden an internationally renowned center for music. Schuricht said of this time, &quot;The German public was no more avid than any other for the novelties I wanted to give it. I have to prepare it for them gently, convince without bludgeoning, cajole and seduce. I managed this by prefacing concerts of modern music by lectures, which I illustrated with extracts played by myself at the piano or by the orchestra.&quot;

His career was not exactly that of a star, but he was loved both by his orchestra players and audiences. As music director in Wiesbaden (1920-1944) he arranged the first German &quot;Gustav Mahler-Festival&quot; in April 1921, conducting Mahler&#x27;s symphonies Nos. 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; (cf. &quot;Signale für die musikalische Welt&quot;, No. 14, 6 April 1921, p. 384); and a week later the Berlin Philharmonic invited him to Berlin, where he conducted Mahler&#x27;s Sixth symphony on May 2, 1921. Mahler&#x27;s works were very popular in Germany, Holland and Austria during the 1920s, but were eventually banned under the Nazis between 1933 and 1945 owing to the composer&#x27;s Jewish origin. Schuricht continued to conduct Mahler outside Germany. On October 5, 1939, during the so-called Phony War, his conducting with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra of Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; was disrupted by a woman heckler who called out &quot;Deutschland über alles, Herr Schuricht!&quot; (This performance is available on a CD.) Schuricht was the first recipient of the Gold Medal of the &quot;Internationale Gustav Mahler-Gesellschaft&quot; in Vienna in 1958. Schuricht worked at the Hague/Scheveningen Festival from 1930 to 1939, and was guest conductor of the Dresden Philharmonic from 1942 to 1944. He was expected to take over as director of the orchestra on October 1, 1944, but escalation of the war ended the orchestra&#x27;s activities. Schuricht himself received a warning that he was about to be arrested, and fled to Switzerland. He settled in Zürich, where he married Maria Martha Banz and conducted l&#x27;Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.

During the late 1940s and 1950s Schuricht conducted throughout Switzerland, at the re-opening of the Salzburg Festival in 1946, in Paris, and at the festivals of Holland, Lucerne, Aix-en-Provence and Montreux. He regularly conducted the South German Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1950 to 1966. When the Vienna Philharmonic first toured the US, in 1956, Schuricht replaced the recently deceased Erich Kleiber, sharing the conducting during the six weeks with André Cluytens.

He died at the age of 86 in his home at Corseaux-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, and was buried in Wiesbaden, as an honorary citizen of that city.

<text>Immorality is the violation of moral laws, norms or standards. It refers to an agent doing or thinking something they know or believe to be wrong. Immorality is normally applied to people or actions, or in a broader sense, it can be applied to groups or corporate bodies, and works of art.

==Ancient Greece==
Callicles and Thrasymachus are two characters of Plato&#x27;s dialogues, Gorgias and Republic, respectively, who challenge conventional morality.

Aristotle saw many vices as excesses or deficits in relation to some virtue, as cowardice and rashness relate to courage. Some attitudes and actionssuch as envy, murder, and thefthe saw as wrong in themselves, with no question of a deficit/excess in relation to the mean.

==Religion==
In Islam, Judaism and Christianity, sin is a central concept in understanding immorality.

Immorality is often closely linked with both religion and sexuality. Max Weber saw rational articulated religions as engaged in a long-term struggle with more physical forms of religious experience linked to dance, intoxication and sexual activity. Durkheim pointed out how many primitive rites culminated in abandoning the distinction between licit and immoral behavior.

Freud&#x27;s dour conclusion was that &quot;In every age immorality has found no less support in religion than morality has&quot;.

==Sexual immorality==

Coding of sexual behavior has historically been a feature of all human societies; as too has been the policing of breaches of its moressexual immoralityby means of formal and informal social control. Interdictions and taboos among primitive societies were arguably no less severe than in traditional agrarian societies. In the latter, the degree of control might vary from time to time and region to region, being least in urban settlements; however, only the last three centuries of intense urbanisation, commercialisation and modernisation have broken with the restrictions of the pre-modern world, in favor of a successor society of fractured and competing sexual codes and subcultures, where sexual expression is integrated into the workings of the commercial world.

Nevertheless, while the meaning of sexual immorality has been drastically redefined in recent times, arguably the boundaries of what is acceptable remain publicly policed and as highly charged as ever, as the decades-long debates in the US over reproductive rights after &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, or 21st-century controversy over child images on Wikipedia and Amazon would tend to suggest.

Defining sexual immorality across history is difficult as many different religions, cultures and societies have held contradictory views about sexuality. But there is an almost universal disdain for two sexual practices throughout history. These two behaviors include infidelity within a monogamous, romantic relationship and incest between immediate family members.

Other than these two practices, some cultures throughout history have permitted sexual behaviors considered obscene by many cultures today, such as marriage between cousins, polygyny, underage sex, rape during war or forced assimilation, and even zoophilia.

==Modernity==
Michel Foucault considered that the modern world was unable to put forward a coherent moralityan inability underpinned philosophically by emotivism. Nevertheless, modernism has often been accompanied by a cult of immorality, as for example when John Ciardi acclaimed Naked Lunch as &quot;a monumentally moral descent into the hell of narcotic addiction&quot;.

==Immoral psychoanalysis==
Psychoanalysis received much early criticism for being the unsavory product of an immoral townVienna; psychoanalysts for being both unscrupulous and dirty-minded.

Freud himself however was of the opinion that &quot;anyone who has succeeded in educating himself to truth about himself is permanently defended against the danger of immorality, even though his standard of morality may differ&quot;. Nietzsche referred to his ethical philosophy as Immoralism.

==Literary references==
*When questioned by a proof-reader whether his description of Meleager as the immoral poet should be immortal poet, T. E. Lawrence replied: &quot;Immorality I know. Immortality I cannot judge. As you please: Meleager will not sue us for libel&quot;.
*De Quincey set out an (inverted) hierarchy of immorality in his study On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts: &quot;if once a man indulges himself in murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and from that to procrastination and incivility...this downward path&quot;.

<text>Sir William Davenant (baptised 3 March 1606 – 7 April 1668), also spelled D&#x27;Avenant, was an English poet and playwright. Along with Thomas Killigrew, Davenant was one of the rare figures in English Renaissance theatre whose career spanned both the Caroline and Restoration eras and who was active both before and after the English Civil War and during the Interregnum.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Davenant is believed to have been born in late February, 1606 in Oxford, the son of Jane Shepherd Davenant and John Davenant, proprietor of the Crown Tavern (or Crown Inn) and Mayor of Oxford. He was baptised on 3 March, his godfather sometimes being said to have been William Shakespeare, who, according to John Aubrey, had stayed frequently at the Crown during his travels between London and Stratford-upon-Avon. It was even rumoured that he was the Bard&#x27;s biological son as well. This story was recorded by Aubrey from a comment attributed to Davenant by Samuel Butler:

It has been suggested that Davenant simply meant that he saw himself as a literary son of Shakespeare, in the same way that followers of Ben Jonson called themselves the &quot;Sons of Ben&quot;. However, according to Samuel Schoenbaum, since Aubrey&#x27;s comment was unpublished, the existence of some other sources saying the same thing suggests that the story that &quot;Sir William was more than Shakespeare&#x27;s mere poetical offspring was common in Davenant&#x27;s lifetime.&quot; In 1618, after Shakespeare&#x27;s death, the 12-year-old Davenant wrote an ode &quot;&quot;.

He attended Lincoln College, Oxford, for a while in about 1620, but left before gaining any degree, becoming a page to the Duchess of Richmond. In London in 1630, he contracted a venereal disease, and was given a syphilis treatment by Thomas Cademan. As a convalescent, he left for the country in 1632 for a time. The syphilis severely disfigured his nose, resulting in damage that is discreetly depicted in John Greenhill&#x27;s portrait. His ruined nose was the subject of much ribald comment by his enemies.

===Poet laureate and Civil War===

Following the death of Ben Jonson in 1637, Davenant was named Poet Laureate in 1638. He was a supporter of King Charles I in the English Civil War. In 1641, before the war began, he was declared guilty of high treason by parliament along with John Suckling, after he participated in the First Army Plot, a Royalist plan to use the army to occupy London. He fled to France. Returning to join the king&#x27;s army when the war started, he was knighted two years later by king Charles following the siege of Gloucester.

In 1645, after the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Naseby, he retired to Paris, where he became a Roman Catholic and worked on his epic poem &quot;Gondibert&quot;. That same year he was appointed Emissary to France, and in 1649 was given the symbolic post of treasurer of the colony of Virginia by the exiled Charles II. The following year, he was made lieutenant governor of Maryland, but was captured at sea, imprisoned, and sentenced to death. In July, 1650, he was put on trial for his life, along with others in front of the newly established High Court of Justice. He is said to have been saved by the intervention of John Milton. He spent all of 1651 in the Tower of London, where he continued writing &quot;Gondibert&quot;.

On his release in 1652, he immediately published &quot;Gondibert&quot;, but he was only pardoned in 1654. In order to avoid the strict laws of censorship in force in all public places at the time, he turned a room of his home, Rutland House, into a private theatre where his works, and those of other writers considered seditious, could be performed. A performance of his &quot;The Siege of Rhodes&quot; at Rutland House in 1656 is considered to be the first performance of an English opera, and also included England&#x27;s first known professional actress, Mrs Coleman.

===Restoration===
Davenant once again found himself in legal trouble in 1659, when he was imprisoned for his part in Sir George Booth&#x27;s uprising in Cheshire after the death of Cromwell. He was, however, released the same year, and left once more for France. When Charles II was restored to the throne, Davenant returned to England. The Restoration also led to the re-opening of theatres, which had been closed due to the influence of the puritans under Cromwell. In 1660, he is publicly recorded as being one of the two theatrical patentees, along with Thomas Killigrew, who obtained a monopoly of public theatre performances. 

He headed the Duke of York&#x27;s Men and produced highly successful theatrical seasons at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields from 1660 until his death in 1668. Among his more successful productions were some Shakespeare plays, including: &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, as well as non-Shakespeare plays such as Sir Samuel Tuke&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of Five Hours&quot; and John Dryden&#x27;s comedy &quot;Sir Martin Marall&quot;. He had returned to England sometime before the initial production of his adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, written with John Dryden, who would be named the next (and first officially by letters patent) Poet Laureate.

He died in London on 7 April 1668, shortly after his final play, &quot;The Man&#x27;s the Master&quot;, was first performed. He is buried in Poets&#x27; Corner at Westminster Abbey where the inscription on his tablet reads &quot;O rare Sir William Davenant&quot;. It has been noted that the original inscription on Ben Jonson&#x27;s tablet, which was already removed by the time Davenant died, was &quot;O Rare Ben&quot;, which was the name Shakespeare supposedly had for Jonson. &quot;O Rare&quot; is a play on the Latin &quot;orare&quot;, to pray.

Nine of his works, though they were previously licensed or produced in London during his life as were all of his plays, were finally published in print posthumously. Several of these were included in &quot;The Works of Sr William D&#x27;avenant Kt.&quot;, by Henry Herringman in 1673, which was copied from Davenant&#x27;s own originals.

<doc id="182975" wikidata="Q189418" url="?curid=182975" title="Brigantine">
<text>A brigantine is a two-masted sailing vessel with a fully square-rigged foremast and at least two sails on the main mast: a square topsail and a gaff sail mainsail (behind the mast). The main mast is the second and taller of the two masts.

Older usages are looser; in addition to the rigorous definition above (attested from 1695), the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; includes two definitions: &quot;a small vessel equipped both for sailing and rowing, swifter and more easily manœuvred than larger ships&quot; and &quot;(loosely) various kinds of foreign sailing and rowing vessels, as the galleon, galliot, etc.&quot;

Modern American definitions include vessels without any square sail(s) on the main mast.

==Mediterranean brigantines==
In the Mediterranean Basin during the 13th century, a brigantine referred to a sail- and oar-driven war vessel. It was lateen rigged on two masts and had between eight and twelve oars on each side. Its speed, maneuverability, and ease of handling made it a favourite of Mediterranean pirates. Its name is derived from the Italian word &#x27;, which in turn is derived from &#x27; &quot;brigand&quot;. Other than in names, this vessel has no relation to the later brigantines developed in Northern Europe.

==17th century and onwards==

By the 17th century, the term was adopted by Atlantic maritime nations. The vessel had no lateen sails, but was instead square-rigged on the foremast and had a gaff-rigged mainsail with square rig above it on the mainmast. The mainmast of a brigantine is the aft one.

By the first half of the 18th century, the word had evolved to refer not to a kind of vessel, but rather to a particular type of rigging: two-masted, with her foremast fully square-rigged and her mainmast rigged with both a fore-and-aft mainsail (a gaff sail) and square topsails and possibly topgallant sails.

The brigantine was the second-most popular rig for ships built in the British colonies in North America before 1775, after the sloop. The brigantine was swifter and more easily maneuvered than a sloop or schooner, hence was employed for piracy, espionage, and reconnoitering, and as an outlying attendant upon large ships for protecting a ship, or for supply or landing purposes in a fleet.

The brigantine could be of various sizes, ranging from 30 to 150 tons burden. The brigantine was generally larger than a sloop or schooner, but smaller than a brig.

==Modern terminology==

The definition given above describes the international usage of the term brigantine. In modern American terminology, the term brigantine usually means a vessel with the foremast square rigged and the mainmast fore-and-aft rigged, without any square sails. Historically, this rig used was called a &quot;schooner brig&quot; or &quot;hermaphrodite brig&quot;. In Europe, the distinction is typically still made. The training ship &quot;Zebu&quot;, which circumnavigated the Earth as part of Operation Raleigh, is an example of a schooner brig.

== Differences from brig ==
The word brig is an 18th-century shortening of the word brigantine, but to mean a different type of rigging. The gaff-rigged mainsail on a brigantine distinguishes it from the brig, which is principally square-rigged on both masts. In addition to the different sail configuration, the brigantine&#x27;s mainmast is made from two parts and equal to that of a schooner, a quite long mast and a top mast. The mainmast of a brig is made from three parts and equal to that of a fully rigged ship - a mast, topmast, and topgallant mast. With the advent of modern (metal) pole masts, this last difference typically no longer exists.

<text>A brig is a type of sailing vessel defined by its rig: two masts which are both square-rigged. Brigs originated in the second half of the 18th century and were a common type of smaller merchant vessel or warship from then until the latter part of the 19th century. In commercial use, they were gradually replaced by fore-and-aft rigged vessels such as schooners, as owners sought to reduce crew costs by having rigs that could be handled by fewer men. In Royal Navy use, brigs were retained for training use when the battle fleets consisted almost entirely of iron-hulled steamships.

Brigs were prominent in the coastal coal trade of British waters. 4,395 voyages to London with coal were recorded in 1795. With an average of eight or nine trips per year for one vessel, that is a fleet of over 500 colliers trading to London alone. Other ports and coastal communities were also served by colliers trading to Britain&#x27;s coal ports. In the first half of the 19th century, the vast majority were rigged as brigs, and that rig was retained for longer in the northeast of England.
==Rigging==
In sailing, a full-rigged &quot;brig&quot; is a vessel with two square rigged masts (fore and main). The main mast of a brig is the aft one. To improve maneuverability, the mainmast carries a (gaff rigged) fore-and-aft sail.

Brig sails are named after the masts to which they are attached: the mainsail; above that the main topsail; above that the main topgallant sail; and occasionally a very small sail, called the royal, is above that. Behind the main sail there is a small fore-and-aft sail called the spanker or boom mainsail (it is somewhat similar to the main sail of a schooner). On the foremast is a similar sail, called the trysail. Attached to the respective yards of square-rigged ships are smaller spars, which can be extended, thus lengthening the yard, thus receiving an additional sailing wing on each side. These are called studding sails, and are used with fair and light wind only. The wings are named after the sails to which they are fastened, i.e. the main studding sails, main top studding sails, and the main top gallant studding sails, etc.

A brig&#x27;s foremast is smaller than the main mast. The fore mast holds a fore sail, fore top sail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the fore mast and the bowsprit are the fore staysail, jib, and flying jib. All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the &quot;running rigging&quot;. This is opposed to the standing rigging which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid.

==Hull material==
A brig is &quot;generally built on a larger scale than a schooner, and may approach the magnitude of a full-sized, three-masted ship.&quot; Brigs vary in length between with tonnages up to 480. A notable exception being the famous designer Colin Mudie&#x27;s &#x27;Little Brigs&#x27; (&quot;TS Bob Allen&quot; and &quot;TS Caroline Allen)&quot;, which are only long and weigh only 8 tonnes. Historically, most brigs were made of wood, although some later brigs were built with hulls and masts of steel or iron. A brig made of pine in the 19th century was designed to last for about twenty years (many lasted longer).

==Development of the brig==
The word &quot;brig&quot; has been used in the past as an abbreviation of &quot;brigantine&quot; (which is the name for a two-masted vessel with foremast fully square rigged and her mainmast rigged with both a fore-and-aft mainsail, square topsails and possibly topgallant sails). The brig actually developed as a variant of the brigantine. Re-rigging a brigantine with two square-rigged masts instead of one gave it greater sailing power. The square-rigged brig&#x27;s advantage over the fore-and-aft rigged brigantine was &quot;that the sails, being smaller and more numerous, are more easily managed, and require fewer men or &#x27;hands&#x27; to work them.&quot; The variant was so popular that the term &quot;brig&quot; came to exclusively signify a ship with this type of rigging. By the 17th century the British Royal Navy defined &quot;brig&quot; as having two square rigged masts.

==Historic usage==

Brigs were used as small warships carrying about 10 to 18 guns. Due to their speed and maneuverability they were popular among pirates (though they were rare among American and Caribbean pirates). While their use stretches back before the 17th century, one of the most famous periods for the brig was during the 19th century when they were involved in famous naval battles such as the Battle of Lake Erie. In the early 19th century the brig was a standard cargo ship. It was seen as &quot;fast and well sailing&quot;, but required a large crew to handle its rigging.
Brigs were seen as more manoeuvrable than schooners. James Cook requested the conversion of the schooner HMS &quot;Grenfell&quot; to a brig, with the justification of the better control that he would have with a brig versus a schooner. The ability to stop the ship quickly (by backing sails) was particularly important for a vessel doing survey work. The windward ability of brigs (which depends as much on hull shape as the rig) could be comparable to or better than contemporary schooners. The author and naval officer Frederick Marryat characterised brigs as having superior windward performance to the schooners of that time. Marryat is considered, by maritime historians, to be an authoritative source on such matters. 
A brig&#x27;s square-rig also had the advantage over a fore-and-aft–rigged vessel when travelling offshore, in the trade winds, where vessels sailed down wind for extended distances and where &quot;the danger of a sudden jibe was the large schooner-captain&#x27;s nightmare&quot;. This trait later led to the evolution of the barquentine. The need for large crews in relation to their relatively small size led to the decline of the production of brigs. They were replaced in commercial traffic by gaffsail schooners (which needed fewer personnel) and steam boats.

==Historic examples==

* HMS &quot;Pilot&quot;, a &quot;Cruizer&quot;-class brig-sloop launched in 1807. While commanded by John Toup Nicholas off southern Italy in 1810–1812, &quot;Pilot&quot; participated in the capture or destruction of over 130 enemy vessels. In 1815 she fought the last naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars, fighting to a draw the French frigate &quot;Légère&quot;.

<text>The USAF Air Demonstration Squadron is the air demonstration squadron of the United States Air Force The Thunderbirds, as they are popularly known, are assigned to the 57th Wing, and are based at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. Created in 1953, the USAF Thunderbirds are the third-oldest formal flying aerobatic team (under the same name) in the world, after the French Air Force Patrouille de France formed in 1931 and the United States Navy Blue Angels formed in 1946.

The Thunderbirds Squadron tours the United States and much of the world, performing aerobatic formation and solo flying in specially marked aircraft. The squadron&#x27;s name is taken from the legendary creature that appears in the mythologies of several indigenous North American cultures.

==Overview==

The Thunderbirds Squadron is a named USAF squadron, meaning it does not carry a numerical designation. It is also one of the oldest squadrons in the Air Force, its origins dating to the organization of the 30th Aero Squadron, formed at Kelly Field, Texas, on 13 June 1917.

Officers serve a two-year assignment with the squadron, while enlisted personnel serve three to four years. As the squadron performs no more than 88 air demonstrations each year, replacements must be trained for about half of the team each year, in order to provide a constant mix of experience. In addition to their air demonstration responsibilities, the Thunderbirds are part of the USAF combat force and if required, can be rapidly integrated into an operational fighter unit. Since 15 February 1974 the Thunderbirds have been a component of the 57th Wing at Nellis AFB. Since 1953, they have flown in front of more than 300 million people.

===F-16 Fighting Falcon===

The Thunderbirds perform aerial demonstrations in the F-16C Fighting Falcon, and they also fly two F-16D twin-seat trainers.

The F-16 has been the demonstration aircraft for the Thunderbirds since the 1983 season. In January 1982, four members of the squadron were killed in what became known as the &quot;Diamond Crash&quot; of T-38 Talon aircraft which the squadron had flown since 1974. Partially as a result of that accident, the squadron switched to the F-16A, and sat out the 1982 airshow season and spent that year retraining and transitioning over to the new aircraft to ready themselves for the 1983 season. The F-16, however, had been considered for transition prior to the accident. In rebuilding the Thunderbird Team, the Air Force recruited previous Thunderbird pilots, qualified each in the F-16A, and had them begin by flying &quot;two-ship&quot; maneuvers, then expanded the program one airplane at a time up to the full six airplanes. Beginning in June 1982, the F-16 Thunderbirds were led by Major Jim Latham.

The team continues to fly the F-16, having switched from the F-16A to the F-16C in 1992. Only a few minor modifications differentiate a Thunderbird from an operational F-16C. These include the replacement of the cannon and ammunition drum with a smoke-generating system, including its plumbing and control switches, the removal of the jet fuel starter exhaust door, and the application of the Thunderbirds&#x27; glossy red, white, and blue polyurethane paint scheme. All the modification work is performed at the maintenance depot at Hill AFB near Ogden, Utah. Other than those modifications, the aircraft are taken from the standard USAF inventory as production fighters, and can be returned to an operational squadron in short order without any major modification.
;General Dynamics F-16A/B Fighting Falcon

:During the switch to the F-16A the Thunderbirds acquired new block 15 aircraft which they operated from 1983 to 1991, making the team one of the last USAF units flying the older F-16As before transitioning into new Cs. They also operated the two-seat F-16B during this time for training new pilots and for VIP flights, these being replaced by the F-16D when the rest of the squadron transitioned to the F-16C.
;Lockheed Martin F-16C/D Fighting Falcon (Block 32)
:The block 32H/J aircraft assigned to the Thunderbirds were built in 1986 and 1987, and operated by the Thunderbirds from 1992 to 2008. At their retirement, they were some of the oldest operational F-16s in the Air Force.
;Lockheed Martin F-16C/D Fighting Falcon (Block 52)
:In the 2009 show season the Thunderbirds transitioned to an updated version of the F-16 fighter. The Block 52s have an upgraded avionics package that brings the Thunderbird fleet into alignment with the rest of the worldwide F-16 fleet. Additionally, the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229 engine adds an additional of thrust. This in turn increases the maximum allowable gross weight for ground handling, taxi, takeoff and in-flight maneuvers by nearly 5,000 lb.

===Support aircraft===

*Boeing C-17 Globemaster III

==Demonstration routine==

From the end of the runway the four-ship Thunderbird team get ready to begin their takeoff roll with the words &quot;Thunderbirds, let&#x27;s run em up!&quot; being retransmitted from the team leader&#x27;s mic through the PA system for the crowd to hear.

Diamond: Historically, as Thunderbirds 1 through 4 lift off, the slot aircraft slips immediately into position behind 1 to create the signature Diamond formation. Thanks to the 2009 upgrade to the Block 52, the Diamond now has more than enough thrust to continue to climb straight up into their first maneuver, the Diamond Loop.

Solos: Thunderbird 5 takes to the air next, performing a clean low altitude aileron roll, followed by 6 who performs a split S, climbing in a near vertical maneuver, rolling over and diving back toward show center and pulling up just above the runway to exit in the opposite direction.
Much of the Thunderbirds&#x27; display alternates between maneuvers performed by the diamond, and those performed by the solos. They have a total of eight different formations: The Diamond, Delta, Stinger, Arrowhead, Line-Abreast, Trail, Echelon and the Five Card. The Arrowhead involves maneuvers in tight formation with as little as fuselage to canopy separation. They perform formation loops and rolls or transitions from one formation to another. All maneuvers are performed at speeds of .
The opposing solos usually perform their maneuvers just under the speed of sound (), and show off the capabilities of their individual aircraft by doing maneuvers such as fast passes, slow passes, fast rolls, slow rolls, and very tight turns. Some of their maneuvers include both solo aircraft at once, such as opposing passes (passing in close proximity to each other) and mirror formations (two aircraft being flown back-to-back in the calypso pass or belly-to-belly). In mirror formations, one Thunderbird must be inverted, and it is always number 5. In fact, the number 5 on this aircraft is painted upside-down, and thus appears right-side-up for much of the routine. There is also an extra piece of humor regarding the inverted performance of Thunderbird 5: the pilots all wear tailored flight suits with their name and jet number embroidered on the left breast. The suit for the pilot of the number 5 airplane has the number sewn upside-down.

Nearing the end the Diamond pulls straight up into the vertical to perform the signature &quot;Bomb Burst&quot;, where all four aircraft break off in separate directions while a solo goes straight up through the maneuver and performs aileron rolls until above the ground. At the end of the routine, all six aircraft join in formation, forming the Delta.

One of the Thunderbirds&#x27; standing engagements is the annual commencement ceremony at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. The jets fly over Falcon Stadium at the precise moment the cadets throw their hats into the air at ceremony&#x27;s end.

==History==

On 19 September 1985, the USAF Air Demonstration Squadron was consolidated by Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) with the 30th Bombardment Squadron, a unit which was organized on 13 June 1917.

During its operational history, the 30th served in World War I as a training unit in France, its mission to train fighter pilots to go into combat on the Western Front. The squadron was almost torpedoed on its troop ship crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Stationed at Clark Field in the Philippines on 7 December 1941, it was almost wiped out in the 1941 Battle of the Philippines. Some members of the squadron fought as an infantry unit and were captured by the Japanese, being subjected to the Bataan Death March. The squadron was withdrawn to Australia, being reformed and later attacked Japan as a B-29 Superfortress squadron in 1945. It was awarded nine Presidential Unit Citations in World War II. During the Korean War, the 30th attacked North Korean targets with B-29&#x27;s.

Present-day USAF Thunderbirds carry the lineage, history, and honors of the 30th on active duty.

===USAF Thunderbirds history===
====F-84 Thunderjet/Thunderstreak era====


After six months training in an unofficial status, the Thunderbirds were activated on 25 May 1953 as the 3600th Air Demonstration Team at Luke AFB, just west of Phoenix.

The team had flown 26 shows by that August. The first team leader was Major Richard C. Catledge (1953–1954), and the first plane used by the unit was the straight-wing F-84G Thunderjet. Because the Thunderjet was a single-seat fighter, a two-seat T-33 Shooting Star served as the narrator&#x27;s aircraft and was used as the VIP/Press ride aircraft. The T-33 served with the Thunderbirds in this capacity in the 1950s and 1960s.

The next year the Thunderbirds performed their first overseas air shows, in a tour of South and Central America, and added a permanent solo routine to the demonstration. In the spring of 1955, under their second commander/leader (September 1954 – February 1957), Captain Jacksel M. Broughton, they moved to the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak aircraft, in which they performed 91 air shows, and received their first assigned support aircraft, a C-119 Flying Boxcar.

====F-100 Super Sabre era====

The Thunderbirds&#x27; aircraft were again changed in June 1956, to the F-100C Super Sabre, which gave the team supersonic capability. This switch was accompanied by a relocation of their headquarters to Nellis AFB, Nevada on 1 June because of maintenance and logistical difficulties of basing the F-100s at Luke, with their first show after the move being held on 23 June. It also signaled a shift in their performance routine—for example, the Cuban Eight opening routine was dropped, and emphasis was placed on low, screaming flyovers and demonstrations of takeoff performance. For a time, if the show&#x27;s sponsor permitted it, the pilots would create a sonic boom; this ended when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) banned supersonic flight over the continental United States. The move to Nellis also resulted in the first assignment of buildings and hangar space to the team.

This practice remained in force through the 1973 season. In 1961, the team was compelled to discontinue the vertical bank maneuver due to an FAA regulation prohibiting aerobatics that pointed the nose of the aircraft toward the crowd. The year 1962 saw the introduction of dual solo routines, and the Thunderbirds went on their first European deployment in 1963, the year after the disbanding of the (see below). The team switched to the F-105 Thunderchief for the 1964 season, but were forced to re-equip with the F-100D after only six airshows due to a catastrophic structural failure of the No. 2 aircraft during a pitch-up maneuver that resulted in the death of Capt Gene Devlin at Hamilton Air Force Base on 9 May. The F-100D Super Sabre was retained through the 1968 season.

====F-4 Phantom II era====

By 1967, the Thunderbirds had flown 1,000 shows. In 1969, the squadron re-equipped with the front-line F-4E Phantom, which it flew until 1973, the only time the Thunderbirds would fly jets similar to those of the Navy&#x27;s Blue Angels as it was the standard fighter for both services in the 1960s and 1970s.

====T-38 Talon era====

The team flew only six air shows in 1973 and was grounded for some time. Due to the 1973 oil crisis, they switched to the more economical T-38 Talon for the 1974 season, as five T-38s used the same amount of fuel as one F-4 Phantom. The switch saw an alteration of the flight routine to exhibit the aircraft&#x27;s maneuverability in tight turns, and ended the era of the black tail on the No. 4 slot plane, now regularly cleaned and shined like the others.

In 1982, the Thunderbirds suffered a catastrophic loss during pre-season training on While practicing the four-plane diamond loop, the formation impacted the ground at high speed, instantly killing all four pilots: Major Norman L. Lowry (commander/leader), Captain Willie Mays, Captain Joseph N. &quot;Pete&quot; Peterson, and Captain Mark Melancon. The cause of the crash was determined by the USAF to be the result of a mechanical problem with the No. 1 aircraft&#x27;s control stick actuator. This resulted in insufficient back pressure by the formation leader on the T-38 control stick during the loop. Visually cueing off the lead aircraft during formation maneuvering, the wing and slot pilots disregarded their positions relative to the ground.

====F-16 Fighting Falcon era====
The team&#x27;s activities were suspended for six months pending investigation of the crashes and review of the program, then reinstituted using the General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon in 1983 and upgraded to the F-16C (now produced by Lockheed Martin) in 1992.

In 1986, the Thunderbirds did a fly-by for the re-dedication of the Statue of Liberty in New York City. They also performed the first American military demonstration in a communist country when the team visited Beijing, China, in 1987.

Their 3,000th air show was performed in 1990, and in 1991 the team went overseas to perform air shows in Switzerland, Poland, and Hungary. The team traveled abroad again in 1996, visiting Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia. Also in 1996, the team participated in the Atlanta Olympics&#x27; opening ceremonies.

The United States Postal Service honored the Air Force&#x27;s 50th anniversary as a separate branch of the military in 1997 with a limited edition stamp featuring the Thunderbirds.

In June 2005, the Thunderbirds selected Major Nicole Malachowski for the No. 3 position, making her the first female to hold a pilot position in the team&#x27;s 53-year history. In 2007, during Maj. Malachowski&#x27;s final season as a Thunderbird, the team selected its second female pilot, Captain Samantha Weeks, who flew the No. 6 opposing solo position.
The 2007 European Goodwill Tour was the Thunderbirds&#x27; first visit to Europe after the 11 September attacks. During this tour, the Thunderbirds performed at their first-ever air show in Ireland. Despite inclement weather, more than 100,000 people attended the air show, garnering nationwide exposure by Irish media. Additional stops along the way included aerial demonstrations in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria&#x27;s Graf Ignatievo Air Base, Italy, France and England, where the Thunderbirds participated in the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world&#x27;s largest military air show. Outside of aerial demonstrations, the team participated in eight official public relations events attended by heads of state and local civic leaders. The team also conducted community outreach by meeting with needy children throughout Europe.

On 10–11 November 2007, the City of Las Vegas and Nellis AFB saluted the U.S. Air Force, hosting the capstone event of the USAF&#x27;s 60th anniversary celebration.
In 2008, the Thunderbirds remained in North America, performing both in the United States and in Canada. When Quebec City celebrated its 400th anniversary, the Thunderbirds joined the Canadian Armed Forces&#x27;s Snowbirds, the British Royal Air Force&#x27;s Red Arrows, and the United States Navy&#x27;s Blue Angels in a ceremonial flight over Quebec City. Later in the year, the team returned to Canada for the Abbotsford International Airshow at Abbotsford International Airport, British Columbia.

In 2009 the Thunderbirds hired their first-ever Air National Guard pilot, Lt. Col. Derek Routt as Thunderbird No. 7 (operations officer), and the first-ever Air Force Reserve Command pilot, Maj. Sean Gustafson, also joined the team as Thunderbird No. 4 (slot).

The 2009 Far East Tour took the team to multiple locations on the western border of the Pacific Rim and included performances in Hawaii, Australia, Malaysia, Guam, Thailand, Japan and South Korea. More than 1.2 million people saw the shows in person and more than 120 million were exposed to the shows through their national media. These are conservative estimates as one Korean prime-time television show alone reached eight million. The top-rated show &quot;Qualifications of Man&quot; did a one-hour feature on the Thunderbirds and resulted from a coordinated media pitch to the network and the Republic of Korea Air Force. In addition to the air shows, the Thunderbirds personally met and spent time with more than five hundred special needs children and orphans.

The entire 2013 flying season was canceled due to budget cuts resulting from the United States fiscal cliff. Team members made recruiting appearances in the Las Vegas area that did not require travel. Enlisted personnel performed gate checks and base housing inspections. Performances resumed in 2014.

====Historical demonstration aircraft====
;Republic F-84G Thunderjet
:Employed by the Thunderbirds 1953–1954.
;Republic F-84F Thunderstreak
:The Air Force selected the swept-wing F-84F Thunderstreak as their second aircraft in 1955, modified for the team by adding smoke tanks, and red, white and blue drogue parachutes. Used from 1955 to 1956.
;North American F-100C Super Sabre
:With the change to the F-100 Super Sabre in 1956, the Thunderbirds became the world&#x27;s first supersonic aerial demonstration team. That same year, the Thunderbirds moved to Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, simplifying logistics and maintenance for the aircraft. The Thunderbirds used the C-model Super Sabre from 1956 to 1963.
;Republic F-105B Thunderchief
:Only six shows were flown in 1964 using the F-105 before safety concerns resulted in the team&#x27;s adoption of the F-100D.
;North American F-100D Super Sabre

:The D-model Super Sabres were used from 1964 to 1968.
;McDonnell F-4E Phantom II
:The 1969 conversion to the F-4 was the most extensive in the team&#x27;s history. Among other modifications, paints that had worked on the F-100 appeared blotchy on the F-4 because of multicolored alloys used to resist heat and friction at Mach 2 speeds. A polyurethane paint base was developed to resolve the problem. The white paint base remains a part of today&#x27;s Thunderbird aircraft. A popular myth is, given the exhaust emissions of the F-4&#x27;s engines, the vertical stabilizer of the No. 4 slot aircraft was painted flat black. However, this is false; the vertical stabilizer of the No. 4 slot aircraft was allowed to be blackened by jet exhaust starting in 1960. Phantoms were used from 1969 to 1973.
;Northrop T-38 Talon
:The fuel crisis of the early 1970s resulted in the selection of the Northrop T-38A Talon, a supersonic trainer. Five T-38s used the same amount of fuel needed for one F-4 Phantom, and fewer people and equipment were required to maintain the aircraft. Although it met the criteria of demonstrating the capabilities of a prominent USAF aircraft, the Talon failed to fulfill the Thunderbird tradition of flying front-line jet fighters. The team flew the Talon from 1974 to 1981.

====Accidents====

In total, twenty-one Thunderbirds pilots have been killed in the team&#x27;s history. Only three fatal crashes have occurred during air shows, two of them in jets:

The first was the death of Major Joe Howard, flying Thunderbird No. 3 (F-4E s/n &quot;66-0321&quot;) on 4 June 1972 at Dulles Airport, during Transpo 72. His Phantom experienced a structural failure of the horizontal stabilizer, and Major Howard ejected as the aircraft fell back to earth tail first from about 1,500 feet and descended under a good canopy, but he landed in the aircraft fireball and did not survive.

The second death occurred 9 May 1981 at Hill AFB, Utah, when Captain David &quot;Nick&quot; Hauck flying Thunderbird No. 6 (T-38A) crashed while performing the hi-lo Maneuver. Capt Hauck crashed while attempting to land his ailing T-38 after an engine malfunctioned and caught fire. With black smoke billowing from the exhaust and the aircraft losing altitude in a high nose-up attitude, the safety officer on the ground radioed Capt Hauck: &quot;You&#x27;re on fire, punch out!&quot; To that, he responded: &quot;Hang on... we have a bunch of people down there&quot;. The aircraft continued to stay airborne for about half a mile before hitting a large oak tree and a barn, then sliding across a field and flipping as it traversed an irrigation canal—ultimately erupting into a fireball just a few hundred feet from the runway&#x27;s end. No one on the ground was injured, even though the accident occurred adjacent to a roadway packed with onlookers.

=====Air shows=====

* 24 September 1961: TSgt John Lesso of the Thunderbirds C-123 crew was killed when a USAF C-123 carrying the Army Golden Knights, on which he was flight engineer, crashed during takeoff at an airshow in Wilmington, North Carolina.
* 4 June 1972: Major Joe Howard, flying Thunderbird No. 3 (F-4 s/n 66-0321), was killed during the Transpo &#x27;72 airshow at Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.
* 9 May 1981: Capt Nick Hauck was killed in the crash of Thunderbird No. 6 (Northrop T-38) during a low approach during an air show at Hill Air Force Base, near Ogden, Utah.
* 14 September 2003: Captain Chris Stricklin, flying Thunderbird No. 6 (F-16), crashed during an airshow at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho. Immediately after takeoff, Stricklin attempted a &quot;Split S&quot; maneuver (which he had successfully performed over 200 times) based on an incorrect mean sea level (MSL) elevation of the airfield, higher than the home base at Nellis AFB. Climbing to only above ground level instead of , Stricklin had insufficient altitude to complete the maneuver, but guided the F-16C aircraft down the runway away from the spectators and ejected less than one second before impact. He survived with only minor injuries and no one on the ground was injured, but the $20 million aircraft was completely destroyed. Official procedure for demonstration &quot;split S&quot; maneuvers was changed, and the USAF now requires Thunderbird pilots and airshow ground controllers to both work in above-MSL altitudes, as opposed to ground control working in AGL (above-ground-level) and pilots in MSL, which led to two sets of numbers that had to be reconciled by the pilot. Thunderbird pilots now also climb an extra before performing the Split S maneuver.
* 20 August 2005: The Thunderbirds temporarily grounded themselves pending an investigation into a minor mid-air incident during the Chicago Air &amp; Water Show. During the diamond pass in review, the tip of the missile rail on the right wing of the slot (#4) aircraft contacted the left stabilator of the right (#3) aircraft. A four-foot section of the missile rail snapped off, while the No. 3 aircraft sustained damage described by one of the Thunderbirds pilots as a &quot;medium deep scratch&quot; to the red paint of the stabilator. This is why the USAF Thunderbirds have taken extra precaution when flying their diamond, changing from about one and a half feet wingtip to canopy separation to around three feet. Amateur video showed the missile rail falling into the &quot;safety box&quot; on Lake Michigan away from boaters. While there were no injuries and the aircraft remained flight worthy, the demonstration was immediately terminated, all aircraft returned to Gary International Airport, and the Thunderbirds did not perform on the second day of the Chicago show. The right wing pilot (#3) was Major D. Chris Callahan, and the slot position (#4) was flown by Major Steve Horton.
* 2 June 2016: Major Alex Turner, flying Thunderbird No. 6, crashed in a field near Colorado Springs, Colorado after performing a flyover at the United States Air Force Academy graduation ceremony. The F-16 pilot ejected and was unhurt. Investigation revealed that the aircraft&#x27;s engine was inadvertently shut down at the start of landing procedures when a faulty throttle trigger permitted the throttle to be rotated into an engine cut-off position. In a strange twist later that day, the Thunderbirds&#x27; Naval counterparts in the Blue Angels suffered a fatal crash of their own.
* 23 June 2017: Capt. Erik Gonsalves was injured when, during landing, Thunderbird No. 8 ran off the runway and overturned prior to the Vectren Dayton Air Show. The pilot and a passenger, Technical Sgt. Kenneth Cordova, were trapped in the aircraft for over an hour. Cordova was uninjured. The investigation revealed excessive air speed coupled with landing too far down a wet runway caused the jet to leave the airstrip and flip over. Rain on the canopy windscreen and failure to follow proper braking procedures during the landing contributed to the accident.

=====Other fatalities=====

====Relationship to other USAF aerial demonstration teams====

The first USAF jet-powered aerobatic demo team was the &quot;Acrojets&quot;, performing early in 1949 with F-80Cs at the USAF Fighter School at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and was headed by Captain Howard W. &quot;Swede&quot; Jensen. This team flew together until August 1950, when it was inactivated due to the American commitment to the Korean War. Additionally, there was also a later USAFE &quot;Acrojets&quot; team in West Germany, this one made up of USAF T-33 Shooting Star instructor pilots at Fürstenfeldbruck AB in the mid-1950s.

The &quot;&quot; were the USAF demonstration team representing the United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) from the late 1940s through the 1950s. This team was formed in early 1949 by a group of 22d Fighter Squadron pilots from the 36th Fighter Wing at Fürstenfeldbruck AB in West Germany. At this time they were flying Lockheed F-80B Shooting Stars. The unit transitioned to the F-84E in 1950, the F-86F in 1955 and the F-100C in 1956. Two of the original Skyblazer team members, identical twins C.A. &quot;Bill&quot; and C.C. &quot;Buck&quot; Pattillo, went on to become members of the first Thunderbird team.

Unlike the Thunderbirds, the Skyblazers seldom appeared outside of the realm of USAFE operations in Europe. The Skyblazers were disbanded in January 1962 when their home squadron was rotated back to the United States and their assigned aircraft transitioned to the F-105 Thunderchief.

The &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; were a group of four C-130 Hercules transport pilots and their planes who were officially recognized as an aerial demonstration team by the USAF&#x27;s Tactical Air Command in 1957. They flew as an aerial demonstration team until 1960.

====Thunderbirds museum====

The USAF maintains a Thunderbirds Museum covering the history of the demonstration team. The museum is located at Nellis Air Force Base and includes a full size F-16 gate guard on display (in full Thunderbird paint scheme).

<doc id="182989" wikidata="Q7405376" url="?curid=182989" title="Salmacida Spolia">
<text>Salmacida Spolia was the last masque performed at the English Court before the outbreak of the English Civil War. Written by Sir William Davenant, with costumes, sets, and stage effects designed by Inigo Jones and with music by Lewis Richard, it was performed at Whitehall Palace on 21 January 1640.

==Intent==
In English, the title means &quot;Salmacian spoils,&quot; and refers to an ancient Greek legend: a band of barbarians pillaging the Greek city of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor are pacified and civilized by drinking from the fountain of Salmacis. The masque was intended to convey a message of yielding and pacification; Charles I had just ended his eleven-year period of personal rule and called for a new session of parliament. In an effort to create an amicable atmosphere for the coming parliamentary session, several leading aristocratic members of the parliamentary party were cast in the masque, including Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford, and Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke. (This effort at political theatre quickly proved useless: the parliament that followed was the famous Short Parliament.)

==Overview==
The masque was unique in that both Charles I and his queen, Henrietta Maria, performed in it; the Queen&#x27;s mother, Marie de&#x27; Medici, was in the audience. In the masque, The King &quot;personated&quot; the role of Philogenes (&quot;lover of the people&quot;), a good but misunderstood ruler. Philogenes endures a fierce tempest that features the spirit of Discord, to reach an ensuing prosperous calm. A chariot descends from the cloudy heavens, carrying the personifications Concord and the Good Genius of Great Britain. The Queen, pregnant at the time, also descends from the heavens, &quot;in a transparent brightness of thin exhalations, such as the gods are feigned to descend in.&quot;

A complex anti-masque featured, among other characters, quack doctors offering &quot;cures&quot; that can only make the chaos greater—for example, &quot;Essence of dissimulation to enforce Love&quot; and &quot;An Opiade of the spirit of Muskadine taken in good quantity to bedward, to make one forget his Creditors.&quot; The anti-masque figures, as shown in Jones&#x27;s surviving sketches, were &quot;bizarrely dressed, physically deformed, and even obscene...one of them is equipped with an enormous erect penis...&quot; The King dispels evil influences from a &quot;golden throne surrounded by palm trees and heroic statues.&quot;

The masque featured elaborate dancing, and the sophisticated special effects that were Jones&#x27;s specialty: for example,

:&quot;[storm and gale, etc., and:] in the midst was a globe of the Earth, which at an instant falling on fire, was turned into a Fury, her hayre upright, mixt with snakes, her body leane wrinkled and of a swarthy colour [etc.]&quot;

The masque concluded with an idealized cityscape of London, replete with &quot;magnificent buildings,&quot; and with another of Jones&#x27;s famous and stunning cloudscapes, &quot;a heaven opened full of deities.&quot;

The royal couple were highly pleased with the masque, and danced it again on the next Shrove Tuesday. The public response, such as there was among the restricted audience, appears to have been less positive, as contemporary witnesses reported more &quot;disorder&quot; among the crowd than usual. An element of negativity in the masque&#x27;s reception was comprehensible, since it attributes the disorder of the realm to the stubbornness of the King&#x27;s subjects (&quot;the people&#x27;s giddy fury&quot;), and hints that the royal power won&#x27;t always be held in check.

Davenant later adapted aspects of &quot;Salmacida Spolia&quot; to create his famous &quot;The Siege of Rhodes,&quot; the &quot;first English opera.&quot;

As was often the case, the masque was published in quarto soon after its performance, in this instance by the bookseller Thomas Walkley. It was reprinted in a duodecimo volume in 1750, by William Rufus Chetwood.

<text>Mary Kathleen Turner (born June 19, 1954) is an American actress. Known for her distinctive deep husky voice, she is the recipient of two Golden Globes, as well as nominations for an Academy Award, a Grammy, and two Tony Awards.

After debuting both off and on Broadway in 1977, followed by her television debut as Nola Dancy Aldrich on the NBC soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot; (1978–1979), Turner rose to prominence with her portrayal of Matty Walker in &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981), which brought her a reputation as a sex symbol. She worked solidly throughout the 1980s, in films such as &quot;The Man with Two Brains&quot; (1983), &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (both 1984), &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;, &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot; (both 1985), &quot;Switching Channels&quot;, &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot; (both 1988), and &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; (1989). For her portrayal of the title character in &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (1986), Turner was nominated for the 1987 Academy Award for Best Actress. Subsequent credits include &quot;V.I. Warshawski&quot; (1991), &quot;Serial Mom&quot; (1994), &quot;Baby Geniuses&quot;, &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Beautiful&quot; (2000), &quot;Marley &amp; Me&quot; (2008), and &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; (2014).

Outside film, Turner guest-starred as Sue Collini on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Californication&quot; (2009) and Roz Volander on Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot; (2019–2021). She also played Charles Bing, the drag queen father of Chandler Bing, on the seventh season of &quot;Friends&quot; (2001). Turner&#x27;s voice work includes Jessica Rabbit in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) and Constance in &quot;Monster House&quot; (2006), as well as characters on television series such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;.

In addition to her work on stage and screen, Turner has taught acting classes at New York University.

==Early life==
Born June 19, 1954, in Springfield, Missouri, to Patsy (née Magee) and Allen Richard Turner, a U.S. Foreign Service officer who grew up in China (where Turner&#x27;s great-grandfather had been a Methodist missionary), Turner is the third of four children, and the only one to be born in the United States. She has a sister, Susan, and two brothers.

Raised in a strictly conservative Christian home, Turner&#x27;s interest in performing was discouraged by both of her parents: &quot;My father was of missionary stock&quot;, she later explained, &quot;so theater and acting were just one step up from being a streetwalker, you know? So when I was performing in school, he would drive my mom [there] and sit in the car. She&#x27;d come out at intermissions and tell him, &#x27;She&#x27;s doing very well.

Owing to her father&#x27;s position with the Foreign Service, Turner grew up in Canada, Cuba, Venezuela, and London, England. She attended high school at The American School in London, graduating in 1972. &quot;The start of real acting for me began during high school in London&quot;, she stated in her 2008 memoir. &quot;There were seven of us who were sort of a theater mafia. We produced, directed, acted, chose the plays, got one teacher fired and another one hired.&quot; Her father died of a coronary thrombosis one week before her graduation, and the family returned to Springfield, Missouri. At the age of 19, Turner began volunteering at a local Planned Parenthood office.

She attended Southwest Missouri State University for two years, studying theater. During this period, director Herbert Blau saw her performance in &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot;, and invited her to spend her senior year at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1977. During that period, Turner acted in several productions directed by film and stage director Steve Yeager.

==Career==
===Theatre work and Broadway debut===
In 1973, Turner spent the summer with her mother in Midland, Texas. There, at the Yucca Theater, Turner made history when she was cast as the first female villain in the Summer Mummers 1973 melodrama, &quot;Plodding Among the Planets&quot;.

Several months after moving to New York City in 1977, Turner took over the female lead in Michael Zetter&#x27;s play &quot;Mister T&quot;, which co-starred Jonathan Frakes and played at Soho Repertory Theatre. That production marked her off-Broadway debut. Several months later, Turner made her Broadway debut as Judith Hastings in &quot;Gemini&quot; by Albert Innaurato, staged at The Little Theatre (now known as the Helen Hayes Theater) and starring Danny Aiello. It opened May 21, 1977, during the time when she was appearing in the soap &quot;The Doctors&quot;.

===Transition to TV and film===
In 1978, Turner made her television debut in the NBC daytime soap &quot;The Doctors&quot; as the second Nola Dancy Aldrich. She made her film debut in 1981 as the ruthless Matty Walker in the thriller &quot;Body Heat&quot;; the role brought her to international prominence. &quot;Empire&quot; cited the film in 1995 when it named her one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in Film History. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2005 that, propelled by her &quot;jaw-dropping movie debut [in] &quot;Body Heat&quot; ... she built a career on adventurousness and frank sexuality born of robust physicality&quot;. Turner ultimately became one of the top box-office draws, and most sought-after actresses of the 1980s and early 1990s.

Turner stated in 2018, &quot;&quot;Body Heat&quot; was a blessing because I went straight to being a leading actor and I didn&#x27;t have to suffer any of this predatory male behaviour like many young actresses. It doesn&#x27;t frustrate me that nearly four decades after that film I&#x27;m still referred to as a sexual icon. I got over that a long time ago.&quot;

Because of her deep, husky voice, Turner was often compared to a young Lauren Bacall. When the two met, Turner reportedly introduced herself by saying, &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m the young you.&quot;

===Stardom===
After &quot;Body Heat&quot;, Turner steered away from &quot;femme fatale&quot; roles to &quot;prevent typecasting&quot; and &quot;because &quot;femme fatale&quot; roles had a shelf-life&quot;. Consequently, her first project after this was the 1983 comedy &quot;The Man With Two Brains&quot;. Turner co-starred in &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; with Michael Douglas and Danny DeVito. Film critic Pauline Kael wrote of her performance as writer Joan Wilder, &quot;Turner knows how to use her dimples amusingly and how to dance like a woman who didn&#x27;t know she could; her star performance is exhilarating.&quot; &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; was a surprise hit: she won a Golden Globe for her role in the film, and it became one of the top-ten-grossing movies of 1984. Turner teamed with Douglas and DeVito again the following year for its sequel, &quot;The Jewel of the Nile&quot;. Pre-production for the movie was fraught with conflict, because Turner refused to commit to the &quot;terrible&quot; script she had been delivered. When she said no, 20th Century Fox threatened her with a US$25 million breach of contract lawsuit. Eventually Douglas, also the film&#x27;s producer, agreed to undertake rewrites on the script to make it more acceptable to Turner, which led to much back-and-forth between the two as the script was retooled right up to when shooting started in Fez, Morocco.

Several months before &quot;Jewel&quot;, Turner starred in &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot; with Jack Nicholson, winning a second Golden Globe award, and later starred in &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, which co-starred Nicolas Cage. For &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, she received the award for Best Actress from the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

In 1988&#x27;s toon-noir &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, she was the speaking voice of cartoon &quot;femme fatale&quot; Jessica Rabbit, intoning the famous line, &quot;I&#x27;m not bad, I&#x27;m just drawn that way.&quot; Her uncredited, sultry performance was acclaimed as &quot;the kind of sexpot ball-breaker she was made for&quot;. (Amy Irving provided Jessica Rabbit&#x27;s singing voice in the scene in which the character first appears in the movie.) That same year, Turner also appeared in &quot;Switching Channels&quot;, which was a loose remake of the 1940 hit film &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;; this, in turn, was a loose remake of the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur comedy &quot;The Front Page&quot;.

Turner was the subject of the 1986 song &quot;The Kiss of Kathleen Turner&quot; by Austrian techno-pop singer Falco. In 1989, Turner teamed with Douglas and DeVito for a third time, in &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;, but this time as Douglas&#x27;s disillusioned wife, with DeVito in the role of a divorce attorney who told their shared story. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the trio, saying that &quot;Mr. Douglas and Ms. Turner have never been more comfortable a team ... each of them is at his or her comic best when being as awful as both are required to be here ... [Kathleen Turner is] evilly enchanting.&quot; In that film, Turner played a former gymnast and, as in other roles, did many of her own stunts. (She broke her nose two years later, filming 1991&#x27;s &quot;V.I. Warshawski&quot;.)

===Slowed by rheumatoid arthritis===
Turner remained an A-list film star leading lady in the early 1990s, starring in &quot;V.I. Warshawski&quot; and &quot;Undercover Blues&quot;, until rheumatoid arthritis seriously restricted her activities. She also blamed her age, stating, &quot;when I was 40, the roles started slowing down, I started getting offers to play mothers and grandmothers.&quot;

In 1992, during the filming of&quot; Serial Mom&quot;, she began experiencing &quot;inexplicable pains and fevers.&quot; The rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis was made about a year later. By the time she was diagnosed, she &quot;could hardly turn her head or walk, and was told she would end up in a wheelchair&quot;. Of this period, she has said: &quot;My body could respond only with excruciating pain whenever I tried to move at all. The joints in my hands were so swollen, I couldn&#x27;t hold a pen. Some days I couldn&#x27;t hold a glass to get a drink of water. I couldn&#x27;t pick up my child... my feet would blow up so badly that I couldn&#x27;t get them into any kind of shoes, let alone walk on them.&quot;

Turner&#x27;s appearance changed after the rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis. &quot;The press were merciless,&quot; she states in her memoir. &quot;They snipped that I had become fat and unrecognizable because I was an angry, washed-up diva, an out-of-control has-been, when in truth the changes in my physical appearance were caused by drugs and chemotherapy and were not within my control. Still, I did not reveal what was happening to me.&quot;

As her rheumatoid arthritis progressed, alcohol consumption became a problem. &quot;I drank consciously at first to kill the pain...Later, after I got the new medicines and the pain began to subside, I kept drinking too much... It didn&#x27;t damage my work, but it damaged me personally.&quot;

Turner has admitted that the drinking made her difficult to be around. In 2005, an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much.&quot; In her memoir, she said: &quot;I went on letting others believe anything they wanted to about my behavior and physical changes. Many people bought the assumption that I&#x27;d turned into a heavy drinker. I couldn&#x27;t publicly refute them because I believed it was worse to have people know that I had this terrible illness. They&#x27;d hire me if they thought I was a drunk, because they could understand drinking, but they wouldn&#x27;t hire me if I had a mysterious, scary illness they didn&#x27;t understand. We – Jay, my agent, myself – felt it was imperative to keep my rheumatoid arthritis quiet.&quot;

Her career as a leading lady went into a steep decline and she was seen in fewer and fewer very successful films. She turned down lead roles in &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, both of which became big hits. She appeared in the low-budget &quot;House of Cards&quot; as well as the comedy-drama &quot;Moonlight &amp; Valentino&quot;, and had supporting roles in &quot;A Simple Wish&quot;, &quot;The Real Blonde&quot;, and Sofia Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. She also provided the voice of Malibu Stacy&#x27;s creator, Stacy Lovell, in the episode &quot;Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy&quot; on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Turner was originally cast as Zira in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;. Turner talked about the role and even sang a portion of her character&#x27;s song (stating the film would be her singing debut) during an interview on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; on March 10, 1998. She was replaced by Suzanne Pleshette in the final film.

===Remission===
Despite drug therapy to help her condition, the disease progressed for about eight years. Then, thanks to newly available treatments, her rheumatoid arthritis went into remission. She was seen increasingly on television, including three episodes of &quot;Friends&quot;, where she appeared as Chandler Bing&#x27;s father, a drag performer.

In 2006, Turner guest-starred on FX&#x27;s &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, playing a phone sex operator in need of laryngeal surgery. She appeared in a small role in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Marley &amp; Me&quot; and also played a defense attorney on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. In 2009, she played the role of Charlie Runkle&#x27;s sexually hyperactive boss in season three of the television series &quot;Californication&quot;.

Turner starred in the indie film &quot;The Perfect Family&quot; in 2011 and had supporting roles in &quot;Nurse 3D&quot; (2013) and the comedy sequel &quot;Dumb and Dumber To&quot; in 2014.

She appeared in two episodes of the Hulu series &quot;The Path&quot; (2016–17), starred in an episode of the anthology series &quot;Dolly Parton&#x27;s Heartstrings&quot; (2019) and guest-starred on two episodes of the CBS comedy series &quot;Mom&quot; in 2020. On the Netflix dramedy series &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot;, Turner was a guest in season 2 (2019) and became a main cast member in season 3 (2021). The series reunited her with fellow actor Michael Douglas for the first time since &quot;The War of the Roses&quot;.

===Voice acting===
Turner provided the voice of Jessica Rabbit in the 1988 live action/animated film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, its three animated short film spinoffs, and in the Disneyland attraction spinoff, &quot;Roger Rabbit&#x27;s Car Toon Spin&quot;. In 2006, Turner voiced the character Constance in the animated film &quot;Monster House&quot;. Later, she provided radio commercial voice-overs for Lay&#x27;s potato chips. BBC Radio 4 produced four radio dramas based on the V. I. Warshawski novels by Sara Paretsky. Two of them, &quot;Killing Orders&quot; and &quot;Deadlock&quot;, released in 2007, featured Turner reprising her 1991 film role, which had been based on Paretsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Deadlock&quot;; however, the final series, &quot;Bitter Medicine&quot;, released in 2009, had Sharon Gless take over the part. In 2015, she narrated the anthology drama film &quot;Emily &amp; Tim&quot;. Turner also had voice guest roles on the animated series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;3Below: Tales of Arcadia&quot;, &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, &quot;Summer Camp Island&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

===Stage career===
After 1990s roles in Broadway productions of &quot;Indiscretions&quot; and &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (for which she earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress), Turner moved to London in 2000 to star in a stage version of &quot;The Graduate&quot;. The BBC reported that initially mediocre ticket sales for &quot;The Graduate&quot; &quot;went through the roof when it was announced that Turner, then aged 45, would appear naked on stage&quot;. While her performance as the seductive Mrs. Robinson was popular with audiences, with sustained high box office for the duration of Turner&#x27;s run, she received mixed reviews from critics. The play transferred to Broadway in 2002 to similar critical reaction.

In 2005, Turner beat a score of other contenders (including Jessica Lange, Frances McDormand, and Bette Midler) for the role of Martha in a 2005 Broadway revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; at the Longacre Theatre. Albee later explained to the &quot;New York Times&quot; that when Turner read for the part with her eventual co-star Bill Irwin, he heard &quot;an echo of the &#x27;revelation&#x27; that he had felt years ago when the parts were read by [Uta] Hagen and Arthur Hill.&quot; He added that Turner had &quot;a look of voluptuousness, a woman of appetites, yes ... but a look of having suffered, as well.&quot;

Ben Brantley praised Turner at length, writing:

As Martha, Turner received her second Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Play, losing to Cherry Jones. The production was transferred to London&#x27;s Apollo Theatre in 2006. She starred in Sandra Ryan Heyward&#x27;s one-woman show, &quot;Tallulah&quot;, which she toured across the U.S.

In August 2010, Turner portrayed the role of Sister Jamison Connelly in Matthew Lombardo&#x27;s drama &quot;High&quot; at Hartford TheaterWorks. The production transferred to Broadway at the Booth Theater where it opened in previews on March 25, 2011, officially on April 19, 2011, and an announced quick closing on April 24, 2011. However, in a rare move, the production was revived, still headed by Turner, to undertake a national tour which began in Boston in December 2012.

From August to October 28, 2012, Turner appeared in &quot;Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins&quot;, a play about the legendary liberal Texas columnist Molly Ivins, at Arena Stage in Washington, DC. In December 2014 and January 2015, Turner performed the same show at Berkeley Repertory Theatre. She appeared again at Arena Stage in the title role of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage&quot;, which opened in February 2014, and playing Joan Didion in the one-woman show &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot;, based on Didion&#x27;s memoir of the same name, in October and November 2016. In February 2019, Turner made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in the speaking role of The Duchess of Krakentorp in Donizetti&#x27;s opera &quot;La fille du régiment&quot;.

==Personal life==
Turner married real estate entrepreneur Jay Weiss of New York City in 1984, and they had one daughter, singer Rachel Ann Weiss, who was born on October 14, 1987. Turner and Weiss divorced in December 2007, but Turner has said, &quot;[Jay]&#x27;s still my best friend.&quot;

By the late 1980s, Turner had acquired a reputation for being difficult, what &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;a certifiable diva&quot;. She admitted that she had developed into &quot;not a very kind person&quot;, and actress Eileen Atkins—with whom she starred in the play &quot;Indiscretions&quot; on Broadway—referred to her as &quot;an amazing nightmare&quot;. In 2018, she commented on her reputation, stating: &quot;The &#x27;difficult&#x27; thing was pure gender crap. If a man comes on set and says, &#x27;Here&#x27;s how I see this being done&#x27;, people go, &#x27;He&#x27;s decisive.&#x27; If a woman does it, they say, &#x27;Oh, fuck. There she goes.&#x27;&quot; Turner has defended herself against Atkins&#x27; claims, saying that Atkins harbored animosity towards her because she was having trouble memorizing her lines, which Atkins found very unprofessional. Turner later realized that medication she was taking for her rheumatoid arthritis was making her &quot;fuzzy.&quot; She added that, on days when the rheumatoid arthritis in her wrist was especially bad and she warned the other cast members not to touch it, Atkins would intentionally sit on it during a scene where Turner had to play dead, causing Turner extreme pain.

Turner slammed Hollywood over the difference in the quality of roles offered to male actors and female actors as they age, calling the disparity a &quot;terrible double standard&quot;.

A few weeks after leaving the production of the play &quot;The Graduate&quot; in November 2002, she was admitted into the Geisinger Marworth Treatment Center in Waverly, Pennsylvania, for the treatment of alcoholism. &quot;I have no problem with alcohol when I&#x27;m working&quot;, she explained. &quot;It&#x27;s when I&#x27;m home alone that I can&#x27;t control my drinking ... I was going toward excess. I mean, really! I think I was losing my control over it. So it pulled me back.&quot;

===Activism===

Turner has worked with Planned Parenthood of America since age 19, and later became a chairperson. She also serves on the board of People for the American Way, and volunteers at Amnesty International and Citymeals-on-Wheels. She was one of John Kerry&#x27;s first celebrity endorsers. She has been a frequent donor to the Democratic Party. She has also worked to raise awareness of rheumatoid arthritis.

===Memoirs and interviews===
In the mid-2000s, Turner collaborated with Gloria Feldt on the writing of her memoirs, &quot;Send Yourself Roses: Thoughts on My Life, Love, and Leading Roles&quot;. The book was published in 2008. In the book, Turner claimed that, while they were filming &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot;, her co-star Nicolas Cage had gotten drunk and stole a Chihuahua that he liked. In turn, Cage filed a lawsuit against Turner and her book publisher in the UK, who took an excerpt from the book and posted it on their website (before publication). Cage argued defamation and damage to character and won the case, resulting in retractions, legal fees, and a donation to charity. Turner later publicly apologized. During an interview on &quot;The View&quot;, Turner apologized for any distress she might have caused Cage regarding an incident that took place 20 years earlier.

On August 7, 2018, &quot;Vulture&quot; published an in-depth interview with Turner, wherein she expressed her opinion on a wide range of issues, from Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s acting skills to what it was like meeting Donald Trump in the 1980s. Turner&#x27;s frankness and certain revelations she made caused the article to be widely shared in different media outlets, which led to her name trending on Google.

<text>The Hail Mary () or Angelical salutation is a traditional Catholic prayer addressing Mary, the mother of Jesus. The prayer is based on two biblical passages featured in the Gospel of Luke: the Angel Gabriel&#x27;s visit to Mary (the Annunciation) and Mary&#x27;s subsequent visit to Elisabeth, the mother of John the Baptist (the Visitation). It is also called the Angelical Salutation, as the prayer is based on the Archangel Gabriel&#x27;s words to Mary. The Hail Mary is a prayer of praise for and of petition to Mary, regarded as the Theotokos (Mother of God). Since the 16th century, the version of the prayer used in the Catholic Church closes with an appeal for her intercession. The prayer takes different forms in various traditions and has often been set to music.

In the Latin Church, the Hail Mary forms the basis of other prayers such as the Angelus and the Rosary. In the psalmody of the Oriental Orthodox Churches a daily Theotokion is devoted to ascribing praise to the Mother of God. In addition, the Eastern Orthodox Churches have a common private prayer quite similar to the Hail Mary, though without the explicit request for intercession. The Eastern Catholic Churches follow their respective traditions or adopt the Latin Church version, which is also used by many other Western groups historically branching from the Catholic Church, such as Lutherans, Anglicans, Independent Catholics, and Old Catholics.

==Text==
The Latin version of the prayer is the most common in English-speaking and other Western countries.
==Biblical source==
The prayer incorporates two greetings to Mary recorded in the Gospel of Luke: &quot;Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee&quot;, and &quot;Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb&quot;. In mid-13th-century Western Europe, the prayer consisted only of these words with the single addition of the name &quot;Mary&quot; after the word &quot;Hail&quot;, as is evident from Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s commentary on the prayer.

The first of the two passages from the Gospel of Luke is the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary, originally written in Koine Greek. The opening word of greeting, (), here translated &quot;hail&quot;, literally has the meaning &quot;rejoice&quot; or &quot;be glad&quot;. This was the normal greeting in the language in which the Gospel of Luke is written and continues to be used in the same sense in Modern Greek. Accordingly, both &quot;hail&quot; and &quot;rejoice&quot; are valid English translations of the word (&quot;hail&quot; reflecting the Latin translation, and &quot;rejoice&quot; reflecting the original Greek).

According to Pope Benedict XVI, &quot;at first sight the term chaire “rejoice”, seems an ordinary greeting, typical in the Greek world, but if this word is interpreted against the background of the biblical tradition it acquires a far deeper meaning. The same term occurs four times in the Greek version of the Old Testament and always as a proclamation of joy in the coming of the Messiah (cf. Zeph 3:14, Joel 2:21; Zech 9:9; Lam 4:21). The Angel’s greeting to Mary is therefore an invitation to joy, deep joy. It announces an end to the sadness that exists in the world because of life’s limitations, suffering, death, wickedness, in all that seems to block out the light of the divine goodness. It is a greeting that marks the beginning of the Gospel, the Good News.&quot;

The word (), here translated as &quot;graceful &quot;, admits of various translations. Grammatically, the word is the feminine perfect passive participle of the verb (), which means &quot;to show, or bestow with, grace&quot; and here, in the passive voice, &quot;to have grace shown, or bestowed upon, one&quot;.

The text also appears in the account of the annunciation contained in chapter 9 of the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Matthew.

The second part of the prayer is taken from Elizabeth&#x27;s greeting to Mary as recorded in Luke 1:42: &quot;Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.&quot; Taken together, these two passages are the two times Mary is greeted in chapter 1 of the Gospel of Luke.

==In Western (Latin) tradition==

After considering the use of similar words in Syriac, Greek and Latin in the 6th century, Herbert Thurston, writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; concludes that &quot;there is little or no trace of the Hail Mary as an accepted devotional formula before about 1050&quot; – though a later pious tale attributed to Ildephonsus of Toledo (fl. 7th century) the use of the first part, namely the angel&#x27;s greeting to Mary, without that of Elizabeth, as a prayer. All the evidence suggests that it took its rise from certain versicles and responsories occurring in the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which just at that time was coming into favour among the monastic orders.

Thomas Aquinas spoke of the name &quot;Mary&quot; as the only word added at his time to the Biblical text, to indicate the person who was &quot;full of grace&quot;. But at about the same time the name &quot;Jesus&quot; was also added, to specify who was meant by the phrase &quot;the fruit of thy womb&quot;.

The Western version of the prayer is thus not derived from the Greek version: even the earliest Western forms have no trace of the Greek version&#x27;s phrases: &quot;Mother of God and Virgin&quot; and &quot;for thou hast given birth to the Saviour of our souls&quot;.

To the greeting and praise of Mary of which the prayer thus consisted, a petition &quot;Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death&quot; was added later. The petition first appeared in print in 1495 in Girolamo Savonarola&#x27;s . The &quot;Hail Mary&quot; prayer in Savonarola&#x27;s exposition reads: &quot;Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.&quot;

The petition was commonly added around the time of the Council of Trent. The Dutch Jesuit Petrus Canisius is credited with adding in 1555 in his Catechism the sentence

Eleven years later, the sentence was included in the Catechism of the Council of Trent of 1566. The catechism says that to the first part of the Hail Mary, by which &quot;we render to God the highest praise and return Him most gracious thanks, because He has bestowed all His heavenly gifts on the most holy Virgin ... the Church of God has wisely added prayers and an invocation addressed to the most holy Mother of God. ...We should earnestly implore her help and assistance; for that she possesses exalted merits with God, and that she is most desirous to assist us by her prayers, no one can doubt without impiety and wickedness.&quot; Soon after, in 1568 Pope Pius V included the full form as now known in his revision of the Roman Breviary.

The current Latin version is thus as follows, with accents added to indicate how the prayer is said in the current ecclesiastical pronunciation of Latin, as well as macrons to indicate the Classical vowel lengths:


Because recitation of the Angelus, a prayer within which the Hail Mary is recited three times, is usually accompanied by the ringing of the Angelus bell, words from the Ave Maria were often inscribed on bells.

===Indulgence===
The &quot;Enchiridion Indulgentiarum&quot; (Indulgences Handbook) grants the partial indulgence for this prayer.

==Byzantine Christian use==
The Hail Mary prayer of the Eastern Orthodox Church and Byzantine Rite Catholic Churches is similar to the first part of the Latin Church form, with the addition of a very brief opening phrase and a short concluding phrase. It is well known and often used, though not quite as frequently as in the Western Church. It appears in several canons of prayer. It is typically sung thrice at the end of Vespers during an All-Night Vigil, and occurs many times in the course of daily prayer.

The Greek text, of which those in other languages are translations, is:
To the Biblical texts this adds the opening invocation &quot;Theotokos Virgin&quot;, the name &quot;Mary&quot;, and the concluding phrase &quot;because it was the Saviour of our souls that thou borest&quot;.

Another English rendering of the same text reads:
or:
===Aramaic version===
The Aramaic version has been reconstructed (probably from Arabic) by Afram Barsoum in the following way:
===Slavonic versions===
There exist two variant versions in Church Slavonic:
The first is the older, and remains in use by the Old Believers as well as those who follow the Ruthenian recension (among them the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Catholic Church). The second, corresponding more closely to the Greek, appeared in 1656 under the liturgical reforms of Patriarch Nikon of Moscow, and is in use by the Russian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

==Latin Church Catholic use==
The Hail Mary is the last prayer in Appendix V of the Roman Missal, the last of seven prayers under the heading &quot;Thanksgiving After Mass&quot;. There it appears with &quot;with you&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;with thee&quot;, &quot;are you&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;art thou&quot; and &quot;your womb&quot; in place of the traditional &quot;thy womb&quot;:

The Hail Mary is the central part of the Angelus, a devotion generally recited thrice daily by many Catholics, as well as broad and high church Anglicans, and Lutherans who usually omit the second half.

The Hail Mary is an essential element of the Rosary, a prayer method in use especially among Roman Rite (Western) Catholics. The Eastern Catholic Churches say a similar version.

The Rosary consists traditionally of three sets of five Mysteries, each Mystery being meditated on while reciting a decade (a set of ten) of Ave Maria. The 150 Ave Maria of the Rosary thus echo the 150 psalms. These Mysteries concern events of Jesus&#x27; life during his childhood (Joyful Mysteries), Passion (Sorrowful Mysteries), and from his Resurrection onwards (Glorious Mysteries). Another set, the Luminous Mysteries, is of comparatively recent origin, having been proposed by Pope John Paul II in 2002. Each decade of Ave Maria is preceded by the Our Father (Pater Noster or &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;) and followed by the Glory Be (Gloria Patri) (Doxology). The repetition of the fixed-language prayers assists recitation from the heart rather than the head. Pope Paul V said that &quot;the Rosary is a treasure of graces ... even for those souls who pray without meditating, the simple act of taking the beads in hand to pray is already a remembrance of God – of the supernatural&quot;.

==Lutheran use==
Martin Luther believed that Mary should be held in highest reverence, advocating the use of the first half of the Hail Mary (that is, &quot;Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.&quot;) as a sign of reverence for and devotion to the Virgin. The 1522 (Prayer Book) retained the Hail Mary. The second part of the prayer used in Catholicism today (&quot;Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death&quot;) was not in use in Germany at the time.

==Anglican use==
Some Anglicans also employ the Hail Mary in devotional practice. Anglo-Catholic Anglicans use the prayer in much the same way as Roman Catholics, including use of the Rosary and the recitation of the Angelus. Many Anglican churches contain artistic depictions of the Virgin Mary, but only a minority use Marian devotional prayers such as the Hail Mary. That manifestation of veneration of Mary, decried by some Protestants as Mariolatry, was largely removed from Anglican churches during the English Reformation but was reintroduced to some extent during the Oxford Movement of the mid-1800s.

==Musical settings==

The Hail Mary ( in Latin) has been set to music numerous times. The title &quot;Ave Maria&quot; has been given also to musical compositions that are not settings of the prayer.

One of the most famous is the version by Franz Schubert (1825), composed as (Ellen&#x27;s Third Song), D839, part 6 of his Opus 52, a setting of seven songs from Walter Scott&#x27;s popular epic poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, translated into German by Adam Storck. Although it opens with the greeting &quot;Ave Maria&quot; (&quot;Hail Mary&quot;), the text was not that of the traditional prayer, but nowadays it is commonly sung with words of the prayer. Its music was used in the final segment of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;.

In Gounod&#x27;s version, he superimposed melody and the words to the first prelude from Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, omitting only the words &quot;Mater Dei&quot; (Mother of God).

Anton Bruckner wrote three different settings, the best known being a motet for seven voices. Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s version was composed in 1877. Another setting of Ave Maria was written by Giuseppe Verdi as part for his 1887 opera &quot;Otello&quot;. Russian composer César Cui, who was raised Roman Catholic, set the text at least three times: as the &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, op. 34, for one or two women&#x27;s voices with piano or harmonium (1886), and as part of two of his operas: (premiered 1894) and &quot;Mateo Falcone&quot; (1907).

Settings also exist by Mozart, Liszt, Byrd, Elgar, Saint-Saëns, Offenbach, Rossini, Brahms, Stravinsky, Mascagni, Lauridsen, David Conte and Lorenzo Perosi as well as numerous versions by less well-known composers, such as J. B. Tresch, Margit Sztaray, Mme. Tarbé des Sablons, Einojuhani Rautavaara and Ninel Samokhvalova.

In the Renaissance, this text was also set by numerous composers, including Josquin des Prez, Orlando di Lasso, Tomás Luis de Victoria, and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Before the Council of Trent there were actually different versions of the text, so the earlier composers in the period sometimes set versions of the text different from the ones shown above. Josquin des Prez, for example, himself set more than one version of the Ave Maria. Here is the text of his motet &quot;Ave Maria ... Virgo serena&quot;, which begins with the first six words above and continues with a poem in rhymed couplets.


The much-anthologized &quot;Ave Maria&quot; by Jacques Arcadelt is actually a 19th-century arrangement by Pierre-Louis Dietsch, loosely based on Arcadelt&#x27;s three part madrigal &quot;Nous voyons que les hommes&quot;.

In the 20th century, Franz Biebl composed Ave Maria (Angelus Domini), actually a setting of the Angelus prayer, in which the Ave Maria is repeated three times, but its second part only once as the climax.

In Slavonic, the text was also a popular subject for setting to music by Eastern European composers. These include Rachmaninov, Stravinsky, Bortniansky, Vavilov (his version often misattributed to Caccini), Mikhail Shukh, Lyudmyla Hodzyumakha and others.

A famous setting for the Orthodox version of the prayer in Church Slavonic (Bogoroditsye Djevo) was composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff in his &quot;All-Night Vigil&quot;.

Since Protestant Christianity generally avoids any special veneration of Mary, musical settings of the prayer are sometimes sung to other texts that preserve the word boundaries and syllable stresses.

<text>The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC ) is a pro-Israel lobbying group that advocates its policies to the legislative and executive branches of the United States. One of several pro-Israel lobbying organizations in the country, it has been called one of its most powerful lobbying groups.

AIPAC was founded in 1954 by Isaiah L. Kenen, a lobbyist for the Israeli government, partly to counter negative international reactions to Israel&#x27;s Qibya massacre of Palestinian villagers that year. AIPAC only became a powerful organization during its peak influence in the 1980s. In 2002, AIPAC expressed intent to lobby Congress to authorize use of force in Iraq, and in 2003, the Iraq War was defended at AIPAC events. In 2005, a Pentagon analyst pleaded guilty to espionage charges of passing U.S. government secrets to senior AIPAC officials, in what became known as the AIPAC espionage scandal.

Until 2021, AIPAC did not raise funds for political candidates itself; its members raised money for candidates through political action committees unaffiliated with AIPAC and by other means. In late 2021, AIPAC formed its own political action committee. It also announced plans for a Super PAC, which can spend money on behalf of candidates. Its critics have stated it acts as an agent of the Israeli government with a &quot;stranglehold&quot; on the United States Congress with its power and influence. AIPAC has been accused of being strongly allied with the Likud party of Israel, and the Republican Party in the U.S. An AIPAC spokesman has called this a &quot;malicious mischaracterization&quot;.

AIPAC describes itself as a bipartisan organization. AIPAC states that it has over 3 million members, 17 regional offices, and &quot;a vast pool of donors&quot;. AIPAC&#x27;s supporters claim its bipartisan nature can be seen at its yearly policy conference, which in 2016 included both major parties&#x27; nominees: Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. AIPAC has been criticized as being unrepresentative of American Jews who support Israel, and supportive only of right-wing Israeli policy and viewpoints.

==History==
===Formation (1953–1970s)===
Journalist and lawyer Isaiah L. Kenen founded the American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs (AZCPA) as a lobbying division of the American Zionist Council (AZC), and they split in 1954. Kenen, a lobbyist for the Israeli government, had at earlier times worked for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As a lobbyist, Kenen diverged from AZC&#x27;s usual public relations efforts by trying to broaden support for Israel among traditionally non-Zionist groups. The founding of the new organization was in part a response to the negative international reaction to the October 1953 Qibya massacre, in which Israeli troops under Ariel Sharon killed at least sixty-nine Palestinian villagers, two-thirds of them women and children. As the Eisenhower administration suspected the AZC of being funded by the government of Israel, it was decided that the lobbying efforts should be separated into a separate organization with separate finances.

In 1959, AZCPA was renamed the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, reflecting a broader membership and mission. Kenen led the organization until his retirement in 1974, when he was succeeded by Morris J. Amitay. According to commentator M.J. Rosenberg, Kenen was &quot;an old-fashioned liberal,&quot; who did not seek to win support by donating to campaigns or otherwise influencing elections, but was willing to &quot;play with the hand that is dealt to us.&quot;

===Rise (1970s to 1980s)===
By the 1970s, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and AIPAC had assumed overall responsibility for Israel-related lobbying within the Jewish communal landscape. The Conference of Presidents was responsible for speaking to the Executive Branch of the U.S. government, while AIPAC dealt mainly with the Legislative Branch. Although it had worked effectively behind the scenes since its founding in 1953, AIPAC only became a powerful organization in the 15 years after the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

By the mid-70s, AIPAC had achieved the financial and political clout necessary to sway congressional opinion, according to historian Michael Oren. During this period, AIPAC&#x27;s budget soared from $300,000 in 1973 to over $7 million during its peak years of influence in the late 1980s. Whereas Kenen had come out of the Zionist movement, with early staff pulled from the longtime activists among the Jewish community, AIPAC had evolved into a prototypical Washington-based lobbying and consulting firm. Leaders and staffers were recruited from legislative staff and lobbyists with direct experience with the federal bureaucracy. Confronted with opposition from both houses of Congress, United States President Gerald Ford rescinded his &#x27;reassessment.&#x27;&quot; George Lenczowski notes a similar, mid-1970s timeframe for the rise of AIPAC power: &quot;It [the Jimmy Carter presidency] also coincides with the militant emergence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) as a major force in shaping American policy toward the Middle East.&quot;

In 1980, Thomas Dine became the executive director of AIPAC, and developed its grassroots campaign. By the late 1980s, AIPAC&#x27;s board of directors was &quot;dominated&quot; by four successful businessmen—Mayer (Bubba) Mitchell, Edward Levy, Robert Asher, and Larry Weinberg.

AIPAC scored two major victories in the early 1980s that established its image among political candidates as an organization &quot;not to be trifled with&quot; and set the pace for &quot;a staunchly pro-Israel&quot; Congress over the next three decades. In 1982, activists affiliated with AIPAC in Skokie, Illinois, backed Richard J. Durbin to oust U.S. representative Paul Findley (R-Illinois), who had shown enthusiasm for PLO leader Yasir Arafat. In 1984, Senator Charles H. Percy (R-Illinois), then-chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a supporter of a deal to allow Saudi Arabia to buy sophisticated airborne early warning and control (AWAC) military planes was defeated by Democrat Paul Simon. Simon was asked by Robert Asher, an AIPAC board member in Chicago, to run against Percy.

===Contemporary period (Post-1980s)===
In 2005, Lawrence Franklin, a Pentagon analyst pleaded guilty to espionage charges of passing U.S. government secrets to AIPAC policy director Steve J. Rosen and AIPAC senior Iran analyst Keith Weissman, in what is known as the AIPAC espionage scandal. Rosen and Weissman were later fired by AIPAC. In 2009, charges against the former AIPAC employees were dropped.

In February 2019, freshman U.S. representative Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), one of the first two Muslim women (along with Rashida Tlaib) to serve in Congress, tweeted that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy&#x27;s (R-California) support for Israel was &quot;all about the Benjamins&quot; (i.e. about money). The next day, she clarified that she meant AIPAC. Omar later apologized but also made another statement attacking &quot;political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.” The statements aroused anger among AIPAC supporters, but also vocal support among the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and &quot;revived a fraught debate&quot; in American politics over whether AIPAC has too much influence over American policy in the Middle East, while highlighting the deterioration of some relationships between progressive Democrats and pro-Israel organizations. On March 6, 2019, the Democratic leadership put forth a resolution on the House floor condemning anti-Semitism, which was broadened to condemn bigotry against a wide variety of groups before it passed on March 7.

In August 2024, AIPAC&#x27;s headquarters in Washington, D.C. were vandalized by anti-Israel activists.

==Aims, activities, size, and successes==

AIPAC&#x27;s stated purpose is to lobby the Congress of the United States on issues and legislation related to Israel. AIPAC regularly meets with members of Congress and holds events where it can share its views.

===Size===
As of early 2019, AIPAC had 17 regional and satellite offices and a new headquarters on K Street in Washington, D.C. AIPAC spent $3.5 million on lobbying in 2018, a relatively large sum in the realm of foreign policy (more than 10 times J Street&#x27;s lobbying expenditure), but less than many industry lobby groups, according to OpenSecrets, with the top 15 such groups in the US all spending over $15 million. It has also been noted that, simple dollar value comparisons aside, AIPAC has &quot;a somewhat unique model&quot; that often begins donating early in careers of politicians with &quot;long-term promise&quot;. AIPAC also commits to spending on a variety of &quot;less formal means of influence-peddling&quot;, such as luxury flights and accommodation for congress members. In addition to lobbying, AIPAC has affiliated political action committees which spend millions of dollars on political campaigns.

===Generating support among policymakers===

Thomas Dine developed a network to reach every member of congress. American Jews, the &quot;vital core&quot; of AIPAC membership, made up less than 3% of the U.S. population and was concentrated in only nine states. Today, thousands of AIPAC supporters gather at AIPAC&#x27;s annual Policy Conference in Washington, D.C. every year. Donors and VIPs are invited to the Leadership Reception on the final night of the conference, which hosts hundreds of members of Congress.

AIPAC has created &quot;caucuses&quot; in every congressional district, with AIPAC staffers organizing every district&#x27;s Jewish community, regardless of size. Campaign contributions were bundled and distributed to candidates in congressional districts and where they would do some good. According to journalist Connie Bruck, by the end of the 1980s, there were &quot;dozens&quot; of political action committees with no formal relation to AIPAC, but whose leader was often an AIPAC member. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reports that in 1987 at least 51 of 80 pro-Israel PACs were operated by AIPAC officials. Some committees that &quot;operate independently&quot; of AIPAC but &quot;whose missions and membership align&quot; with it include the Florida Congressional Committee, NORPAC in New Jersey, To Protect Our Heritage PAC near Chicago, and the Maryland Association for Concerned Citizens near Baltimore.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; states that &quot;its Web site, which details how members of Congress voted on AIPAC&#x27;s key issues, and the &quot;AIPAC Insider&quot;, a glossy periodical that handicaps close political races, are scrutinized by thousands of potential donors. Pro-Israel interests have contributed $56.8 million in individual, group, and soft money donations to federal candidates and party committees since 1990, according to the non-partisan OpenSecrets. Between the 2000 and the 2004 elections, the 50 members of AIPAC&#x27;s board donated an average of $72,000 each to campaigns and political action committees.&quot; According to Dine, in the 1980s and 1990s contributions from AIPAC members often constituted &quot;roughly 10 to 15% of a typical congressional campaign budget.&quot;

AIPAC influences lawmakers in other ways by:
*matching an AIPAC member with shared interests to a member of Congress. Sheryl Gay Stolberg calls the system of &quot;key contacts&quot; AIPAC&#x27;s &quot;secret&quot; and quotes activist Tom Dine as saying that AIPAC&#x27;s office can call on &quot;five to 15&quot; key contacts for every senator including &quot;standoffish&quot; ones.
*carefully curated trips to Israel for legislators and other opinion-makers, all-expenses-paid for by AIPAC&#x27;s charitable arm, the American Israel Education Foundation. In 2005 alone, more than 100 members of Congress visited Israel, some multiple times.
*cultivating student leaders such as student body presidents. At colleges, it provides &quot;political leadership training&quot; to undergraduate student groups. This is an effort to &quot;build a stronger pro-Israel movement among students on and off campuses nationwide.&quot;
*sympathy for Israel among the general public.

AIPAC has supported loyal incumbents (such as Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Connecticut) even when opposed by Jewish candidates, and the organization has worked to unseat pro-Palestinian incumbents (such as Representative Paul Findley) or candidates perceived to be unsympathetic to Israel (Senator Charles H. Percy). However, a Jewish member of Congress, Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-Illinois), who had maintained good relations with AIPAC and had been given campaign contributions by its members, was opposed by the group in her 2010 reelection campaign after she was endorsed by the advocacy group J Street.

According to former representative Brian Baird (D-Washington), &quot;Any member of Congress knows that AIPAC is associated indirectly with significant amounts of campaign spending if you&#x27;re with them, and significant amounts against you if you&#x27;re not with them.&quot; &quot;AIPAC-connected money&quot; amounted to about $200,000 in each of his campaigns for office—&quot;and that&#x27;s two hundred thousand going your way, versus the other way: a four-hundred-thousand-dollar swing.&quot; AIPAC-directed campaign contributions—as with many interest groups—came with considerable &quot;tactical input&quot;. AIPAC staffers told Baird and other lawmakers, &quot;No, we don&#x27;t say it that way, we say it this way.&quot; Baird complained, &quot;There&#x27;s a whole complex semantic code you learn. ... After a while, you find yourself saying and repeating it as if it were fact.&quot;

===Goals===

AIPAC strongly supports substantial U.S. aid to Israel. In March 2009, AIPAC executive director Howard Kohr appeared before the House Committee on Appropriations&#x27; Foreign Operations subcommittee and requested that Israel receive $2.775 billion in military aid in fiscal year 2010, as called for in the 2007 Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. and Israel that allocates $30 billion in aid for Israel over 10 years. Kohr stated that &quot;American assistance to Israel serves vital U.S. national security interests and advances critical U.S. foreign policy goals.&quot; The military hardware Israel must purchase to face the increased threat of terrorism and Islamist radicalism is increasingly expensive due to the recent spike in petroleum prices which have enabled countries such as Iran to augment their military budgets, according to Kohr.

===The Iraq War===

The day after George W. Bush addressed the United Nations General Assembly to call for action against Iraq, AIPAC said to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that &quot;[i]f the president asks Congress to support action in Iraq, AIPAC would lobby members of Congress to support him.&quot; John Judis wrote in &quot;The New Republic&quot; that although AIPAC lobbying was not widely reported to prevent Arab states from connecting Bush&#x27;s war plans to Israel, executive director Kohr called quietly&#x27; lobbying Congress to approve the use of force in Iraq&quot; one of AIPAC&#x27;s successes at a January 2003 AIPAC meeting. AIPAC spokesman Josh Block told &quot;The New Republic&quot; that AIPAC did no lobbying and that Kohr was misquoted. In articles for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, both Dana Milbank and Glenn Frankel noted that while AIPAC, like the Israeli government, officially had no position on the merits of going to war with Iraq, Bush administration officials were applauded at AIPAC events for defending the Iraq War. Jeffrey Goldberg reported in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that AIPAC had lobbied Congress in favor of the war, but that Iraq was not one of its chief concerns. &quot;J. The Jewish News of Northern California&quot; explained that while AIPAC never explicitly supported or lobbied for the Iraq War, some in the pro-Israel community had seen the war as aligning the United States and Israel against Arab and Muslim radicalism. However, by the time of the 2007 AIPAC annual policy conference, continuing violence in Iraq had undermined that view, and at a conference session, the war was blamed for an increase in global terrorism.

===Policy towards Iran===
AIPAC&#x27;s official position on Iran is to encourage a strong diplomatic and economic response coordinated among the United States government, its European allies, Russia, and China.

In 2012, AIPAC called for &quot;crippling&quot; sanctions on Iran in a letter to every member of Congress. In line with this approach, AIPAC has lobbied to levy economic embargoes and increase sanctions on Iran (known as the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2013). However, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, its effort &quot;stalled after stiff resistance from President Obama.&quot;

On agriculture and agricultural trade AIPAC lobbies for greater cooperation between the two countries. AIPAC considers agriculture to be a key economic sector for economic cooperation between them.

===Successes===
AIPAC has been compared to firearms, banking, defense, and energy lobbies as &quot;long&quot; being &quot;a feature of politics in Washington.&quot;
Its promotional literature notes that the Leadership Reception during its annual Policy Conference &quot;will be attended by more members of Congress than almost any other event, except for a joint session of Congress or a State of the Union address.&quot;
&quot;The New York Times&quot; has described AIPAC as &quot;a major force in shaping United States policy in the Middle East&quot; that is able to push numerous bills through Congress. &quot;Typically,&quot; these &quot;pass by unanimous votes.&quot;

A House of Representatives resolution condemning the UN Goldstone Report on human rights violations by Israel in Gaza, for example, passed 344–36 in 2009.

In 1997, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named AIPAC the second-most powerful influence group in Washington, D.C.

AIPAC advises members of Congress about the issues that face today&#x27;s Middle East, including the dangers of extremism and terrorism. It was an early supporter of the Counter-Terrorism Act of 1995, which resulted in increased FBI resources being committed to fight terrorism.

AIPAC also lobbies for financial aid from the United States to Israel, helping to procure up to $3 billion in aid yearly, making Israel &quot;the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign assistance since World War II.&quot; According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), these include providing aid &quot;as all grant cash transfers, not designated for particular projects, and...transferred as a lump sum in the first month of the fiscal year, instead of in periodic increments. Israel is allowed to spend about one quarter of the military aid for the procurement in Israel of defense articles and services, including research and development, rather than in the United States.&quot;

==Policy Conference==
===2016===
In 2016, nearly 20,000 delegates attended the AIPAC Policy Conference; approximately 4,000 of those delegates were American students. For the first time in AIPAC&#x27;s history, the general sessions of Policy Conference were held in Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Verizon Center in order to accommodate the large number of delegates. Keynote speakers included Vice President Joe Biden, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Governor John Kasich, Senator Ted Cruz, and Speaker Paul Ryan. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has spoken at AIPAC before in person, addressed Policy Conference via satellite on the final day of the conference.

==Prominent officers and supporters==
Howard Kohr has been the CEO of AIPAC since 1996, nearly half of its existence, serving with most of its presidents.

===Presidents===
===Supporters===
AIPAC has a wide base of supporters both in and outside of Congress.
*Support among congressional members includes a majority of members of both the Democratic and Republican Parties. According to AIPAC, the annual Policy Conference is second only to the State of the Union address for the number of Federal officials in attendance at an organized event.

==American Israel Education Foundation==
The American Israel Education Foundation is a sister organization of AIPAC, that handles educational work, rather than lobbying. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational organization that conducts educational programs, including educational trips to Israel for members of the U.S. Congress and other American politicians.

AIEF trips for members of Congress occur every two years, becoming &quot;the top spender on congressional travel&quot; in those years. In August 2019, the foundation sponsored week-long trips with 72 members of Congress: 41 Democrats and 31 Republicans. They traveled to Israel and the West Bank and visited with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Other educational activities include regular seminars for congressional staff.

Critics alleges that these trips are propaganda rather than education and do not tell the Palestinian &quot;side of the story,&quot; and that they violate ethics rules prohibiting lobbying groups from gifting personal travel to congresspersons.

==Political Action Committee==
Until 2021 AIPAC did not raise funds for political candidates itself, but its members raise money for candidates through political action committees unaffiliated with AIPAC and by other means. In late 2021, AIPAC formed its own political action committee. It also announced plans for a Super PAC, which can spend money on behalf of candidates. In a letter explaining the move, Betsy Berns Korn, AIPAC president, said: &quot;The DC political environment has been undergoing profound change. Hyperpartisanship, high congressional turnover and the exponential growth in the cost of campaigns now dominate the landscape.&quot; Dov Waxman, director of the UCLA Y&amp;S Nazarian Center for Israel Studies, said: &quot;Although for decades AIPAC has had informal ties with pro-Israel PACs, it has always refrained from forming its own PAC.&quot; He added: &quot;I think its decision to establish its own PAC and super PAC is based on the recognition that campaign funding is a crucial means of exerting political influence in Congress, and that AIPAC now needs this tool in order to maintain its influence in Congress.&quot;

Former AIPAC executive director Tom Dine and legislative director Douglas Bloomfield criticized the move, saying it could call the organization&#x27;s neutrality into question.

In March 2022, the PAC released its first endorsements of 130 candidates for the House of Representatives and the Senate. The list included 37 Congresspersons of the Sedition Caucus who had voted to overturn the 2020 election of Joe Biden. The endorsement drew criticism from a variety of sources. Former U.S. ambassador to Israel Daniel C. Kurtzer said it was &quot;very disappointing that AIPAC has turned a blind eye to the damage that these people have done to our democracy. Their support of Israel cannot ever trump that damage.&quot; Conservative pro-Israel columnist Jennifer Rubin called it &quot;truly horrifying&quot;.

AIPAC&#x27;s push into the political campaign support comes amid the erosion of bipartisan support for Israel in the US, with opinion polls showing growing criticism for the state among younger Democrats, including American Jews, the breaking of the taboo on comparisons between Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians and apartheid South Africa, and rising support for the Boycott, Sanctions and Divest (BDS) movement.

===United Democracy Project spending===

In May 2022, it was also revealed that AIPAC has been spending millions, channeled through surrogate group, the United Democracy Project (UDP), which makes no mention of its creation by AIPAC, to defeat progressive Democrats and particularly female candidates who might potentially align with &quot;the Squad&quot; of progressive Congress members made up of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.

The UDP spent $2.3m in opposition to Summer Lee in the Pennsylvania Democratic congressional primary race in Pennsylvania. Lee has supported setting conditions for US aid to Israel and accused the country of atrocities in Gaza, comparing Israeli actions to the treatment of young black men in the U.S. The UDP also spent $2m in a North Carolina senate primary to support the incumbent Valeria Foushee against Nida Allam, the first Muslim American woman to hold elected office in North Carolina and the political director for the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders. Both candidates are endorsed by the squad. UDP spent an estimated $280,000 to support incumbent Ohio&#x27;s 11th Congressional District incumbent Shontel Brown over her primary challenger, progressive Nina Turner.

The UDP spent a further $1.2m to help the Democratic congressman for Texas, Henry Cuellar, face off a challenge from Jessica Cisneros, a 28-year-old immigration lawyer also endorsed by the Squad. After Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released a report accusing Israel of imposing apartheid, Cuellar said &quot;[t]hese inaccuracies incite antisemitic behavior&quot; and decried what he called &quot;dangerous effects of falsified name-calling.&quot;

AIPAC veteran Darius Jones founded the &quot;National Black Empowerment Fund&quot; (NBEAF), which contributed money to defeat pro-Palestinian black candidates like Jamaal Bowman, and Cori Bush. NBEAF is led by Richard St. Paul, a member of AIPAC&#x27;s National Council. Some black organizations argue NBEAF advocates for Israel, not black people.

J Street spokesperson Logan Bayroff, has called AIPAC &quot;a Republican front organisation&quot;, a fact that he said they are obfuscating while &quot;trying to persuade Democratic voters who they should support&quot;. He added: &quot;The United Democracy Project sounds innocuous ... but the reason that they’re aligning with certain candidates is because they are more aligned with their more hawkish positions on Israel&quot;.

In mid-March 2024, with reports of AIPAC and UDP planning to spend $100M to primary incumbent progressive House Democrats, opponents formed the Reject AIPAC coalition &quot;to protect democracy &amp; Palestinian rights&quot;. Founding members include: Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), Gen-Z for Change, IfNotNow, Justice Democrats, National Iranian American Council, Our Revolution, Progressive Democrats of America (PDA), RootsAction, Sunrise Movement, Working Families Party.

==Controversy and criticism==

===Criticism===
One critic, former congressman Brian Baird, who &quot;had admired Israel since I was a kid,&quot; but became alienated from AIPAC, argued that &quot;When key votes are cast, the question on the House floor, troublingly, is often not, &#x27;What is the right thing to do for the United States of America?&#x27;, but &#x27;How is AIPAC going to score this?
He cited a 2009 House resolution he opposed condemning the Goldstone Report on civilian deaths. &quot;When we had the vote, I said, &#x27;We have member after member coming to the floor to vote on a resolution they&#x27;ve never read, about a report they&#x27;ve never seen, in a place they&#x27;ve never been.
Baird worries that AIPAC members and supporters believe that they&#x27;re &quot;supporting Israel&quot; when they are &quot;actually backing policies&quot; such as the killing of civilians in Gaza, &quot;that are antithetical to its highest values and, ultimately, destructive for the country.&quot;

A criticism of AIPAC&#x27;s proposal for tougher sanctions on Iran is that the primary incentive P5+1 negotiators can give Iran to stop its nuclear program is reduction in the sanctions that have harmed Iran&#x27;s economy. By imposing even harsher sanctions on Iran, AIPAC takes this chip away. According to a &quot;senior&quot; Obama Administration official, the administration told AIPAC leadership that its tougher sanctions on Iran &quot;would blow up the negotiations—the Iranians would walk away from the table.&quot; The official asked them, &quot;Why do you know better than we do what strengthens our hand? Nobody involved in the diplomacy thinks that.&quot; A former congressional staffer complained to journalist Connie Bruck, &quot;What was striking was how strident the message was,&quot; from AIPAC. How could you not pass a resolution that tells the President what the outcome of the negotiations has to be?
AIPAC has been criticized as being unrepresentative of American Jews who support Israel, and supportive only of right-wing Israeli policy and viewpoints. A PEW center poll found that only 38% of American Jews believe that the Israeli government is sincerely pursuing peace; 44% believe that the construction of new settlements damages Israel&#x27;s national security.

Among the best-known critical works about AIPAC is &quot;The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy&quot;, by University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer and Harvard Kennedy School professor Stephen Walt. In the working paper and resulting book, they accuse AIPAC of being &quot;the most powerful and best known&quot; component of a larger pro-Israel lobby that distorts American foreign policy. They write:

[AIPAC&#x27;s] success is due to its ability to reward legislators and congressional candidates who support its agenda, and to punish those who challenge it. ... AIPAC makes sure that its friends get strong financial support from the many pro-Israel political action committees. Anyone who is seen as hostile to Israel can be sure that AIPAC will direct campaign contributions to his or her political opponents. ... The bottom line is that AIPAC, a &quot;de facto&quot; agent for a foreign government, has a stranglehold on Congress, with the result that US policy towards Israel is not debated there, even though that policy has important consequences for the entire world.

AIPAC has also been the subject of criticism by prominent politicians including Democrats J. William Fulbright, Dave Obey and Mike Gravel, as well as Republicans John Hostettler and Thomas Massie.

Democratic congressman Jim Moran from Northern Virginia has been a vocal critic of AIPAC, causing national controversy in 2007 and drawing criticism from many Jewish groups after he told California Jewish magazine &quot;Tikkun&quot; that AIPAC had been &quot;pushing the [Iraq War] from the beginning,&quot; and that, &quot;I don&#x27;t think they represent the mainstream of American Jewish thinking at all, but because they are so well organized, and their members are extraordinarily powerful—most of them are quite wealthy—they have been able to exert power.&quot; AIPAC&#x27;s membership has been described as &quot;overwhelmingly Democratic&quot; by one conservative columnist (Jennifer Rubin).

In 2020, Democratic congresswoman Betty McCollum accused AIPAC of hate speech and said the group is a hate group.

In 2020, Senator Bernie Sanders said AIPAC provides a platform for bigotry and said he will not attend their conference. In 2023 (February 19), on CBS &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Sanders said that AIPAC, formerly bipartisan, had evolved towards attempting to &quot;destroy&quot; the American progressive movement.

In August 2022, AIPAC tweeted that &quot;George Soros has a long history of backing anti-Israel groups...Now he’s giving $1 million to help @jstreetdotorg support anti-Israel candidates and attack pro-Israel Democrats. AIPAC works to strengthen pro-Israel mainstream Democrats. J Street &amp; Soros work to undermine them.&quot; In response to the tweet, the left-wing Jewish organization IfNotNow denounced AIPAC for antisemitism, tweeting that &quot;AIPAC is the antisemitic far right...They are not a Jewish org, nor claim to be one.&quot;

===Controversies===
Former Senator William Fulbright, in the 1970s, and former senior CIA official Victor Marchetti, in the 1980s, contended that AIPAC should have registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). FARA requires those who receive funds or act on behalf of a foreign government to register as a foreign agent. However, AIPAC states that the organization is a registered American lobbying group, funded by private donations, and maintains it receives &quot;no financial assistance&quot; from Israel or any other foreign group.

In 2006, Representative Betty McCollum (DFL) of Minnesota demanded an apology from AIPAC, claiming an AIPAC representative had described her vote against the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 as &quot;support for terrorists.&quot; McCollum stated that AIPAC representatives would not be allowed in her office until she received a written apology for the comment. AIPAC disputed McCollum&#x27;s claim, and McCollum has since declared the incident over.

====Steiner resignation====
In 1992, AIPAC president David Steiner was forced to resign after he was recorded boasting about his political influence in obtaining aid for Israel. Steiner also claimed that he had &quot;met with (then H.W. Bush U.S. Secretary of State) Jim Baker and I cut a deal with him. I got, besides the $3 billion, you know they&#x27;re looking for the Jewish votes, and I&#x27;ll tell him whatever he wants to hear ... Besides the $10 billion in loan guarantees which was a fabulous thing, $3 billion in foreign, in military aid, and I got almost a billion dollars in other goodies that people don&#x27;t even know about.&quot; Steiner also claimed to be &quot;negotiating&quot; with the incoming Clinton administration over who Clinton would appoint as secretary of state and secretary of the National Security Agency. Steiner stated that AIPAC had &quot;a dozen people in [the Clinton] campaign, in the headquarters... in Little Rock, and they&#x27;re all going to get big jobs.&quot;

New York real estate developer Haim Katz told &quot;The Washington Times&quot; that he taped the conversation because &quot;as someone Jewish, I am concerned when a small group has a disproportionate power. I think that hurts everyone, including Jews. If David Steiner wants to talk about the incredible, disproportionate clout AIPAC has, the public should know about it.&quot;

====Spying allegations====
In April 2005, AIPAC policy director Steven Rosen and AIPAC senior Iran analyst Keith Weissman were fired by AIPAC amid an FBI investigation into whether they passed classified U.S. information received from Lawrence Franklin on to the government of Israel. They were later indicted for illegally conspiring to gather and disclose classified national security information to Israel. AIPAC agreed to pay the legal fees for Weissman&#x27;s defense through appeal if necessary.

In May 2005, the Justice Department announced that Lawrence Anthony Franklin, a U.S. Air Force Reserves colonel working as a Department of Defense analyst at the Pentagon in the office of Douglas Feith, had been arrested and charged by the FBI with providing classified national defense information to Israel. The six-count criminal complaint identified AIPAC by name and described a luncheon meeting in which, allegedly, Franklin disclosed top-secret information to two AIPAC officials.

Franklin pleaded guilty to passing government secrets to Rosen and Weissman and revealed for the first time that he also gave classified information directly to an Israeli government official in Washington. On January 20, 2006, he was sentenced to 151 months (almost 13 years) in prison and fined $10,000. As part of the plea agreement, Franklin agreed to cooperate in the larger federal investigation. All charges against the former AIPAC employees were dropped in 2009.

====Support for 2020 election deniers====
After the formation of its first political action committee (PAC) in early March 2022, AIPAC was criticized for backing the election campaigns of 37 Republican members of Congress who voted against certifying Biden&#x27;s 2020 U.S. presidential election victory after the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

The endorsement of the politicians was described as &quot;morally bankrupt and short-sighted&quot; by Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, while Abe Foxman, former head of the Anti-Defamation League, called it a &quot;sad mistake&quot;, and Dan Kurtzer, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, urged AIPAC to reconsider the move. Halie Soifer, of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the move suggested &quot;one must compromise support of America’s democracy to support Israel&quot;, which, she noted in an opinion piece published in &quot;Haaretz&quot;, presents &quot;a patently false dichotomy rejected by the overwhelming majority of American Jews.&quot;

AIPAC defended the endorsements by stating that it was &quot;no moment for the pro-Israel movement to become selective about its friends&quot;. In a later, &quot;rare rebuke&quot; of the lobby group from within the Israeli government, Alon Tal, a member of the Knesset, criticized the AIPAC endorsements as &quot;outrageous&quot;, noting that criticism was important for maintaining what Tal referred to as &quot;a healthy relationship between Israel and American Jewry&quot;, according to &quot;The Times of Israel&quot;.

====Financing pro-Israel Democrats in 2022====
Having endorsed over 100 Republican members of Congress who had voted against certifying Joe Biden&#x27;s election, AIPAC spent $24 million, via its political action committee, the United Democracy Project, to defeat candidates not considered pro-Israel enough in the primaries of the Democratic Party that select candidates for the 2022 midterm elections. Substantial contributions to this funding were obtained from Republican Trump campaign financiers such as Paul Singer and Bernie Marcus, together with Haim Saban. It spent $4 million to support Haley Stevens and defeat the Jewish congressman Andy Levin who is known to be critical of AIPAC&#x27;s support for hardline Israeli policies. It spent $7 million to defeat the favorite in a Maryland July primary, Donna Edwards, who had failed to back resolutions in support of Israel during its War in Gaza in 2012. A number of AIPAC supporters assert that reports focusing on AIPAC&#x27;s campaign funding against candidates critical of Israel&#x27;s policies are &#x27;antisemitic&#x27;.

==AIPAC in film==
The Israeli documentary film &quot;The Kings of Capitol Hill&quot; features interviews with former and current AIPAC personalities and depicts how AIPAC has moved toward the political right wing and away from political positions most American Jews hold.

<text>Pictures at an Exhibition is a piano suite in ten movements, plus a recurring and varied Promenade theme, written in 1874 by Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky. It is a musical depiction of a tour of an exhibition of works by architect and painter Viktor Hartmann put on at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, following his sudden death in the previous year. Each movement of the suite is based on an individual work, some of which are lost.

The composition has become a showpiece for virtuoso pianists, and became widely known from orchestrations and arrangements produced by other composers and contemporary musicians, with Maurice Ravel&#x27;s 1922 adaptation for orchestra being the most recorded and performed. The suite, particularly the final movement, &quot;The Bogatyr Gates&quot;, is widely considered one of Mussorgsky&#x27;s greatest works.

==Composition history==

The composition is based on pictures by the artist, architect, and designer Viktor Hartmann. It was probably in 1868 that Mussorgsky first met Hartmann, not long after the latter&#x27;s return to Russia from abroad. Both men were devoted to the cause of an intrinsically Russian art and quickly became friends. They likely met in the home of the influential critic Vladimir Stasov, who followed both of their careers with interest. According to Stasov&#x27;s testimony, in 1868, Hartmann gave Mussorgsky two of the pictures that later formed the basis of &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;. In 1870, Mussorgsky dedicated the second song (&quot;In the Corner&quot;) of the cycle &quot;The Nursery&quot; to Hartmann. Stasov remarked that Hartmann loved Mussorgsky&#x27;s compositions, and particularly liked the &quot;Scene by the Fountain&quot; in his opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. Mussorgsky had abandoned the scene in his original 1869 version, but at the requests of Stasov and Hartmann, he reworked it for Act 3 in his revision of 1872.

The years 1873–74 are associated with the staging of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, the zenith of Mussorgsky&#x27;s career as a composer—at least from the standpoint of public acclaim. Mussorgsky&#x27;s distant relative, friend, and roommate during this period, Arseniy Golenishchev-Kutuzov, describing the January 1874 premiere of the opera, remarked: &quot;During the winter, there were, I think, nine performances, and each time the theatre was sold out, each time the public tumultuously called for Mussorgsky.&quot; The composer&#x27;s victory, however, was overshadowed by the hostile press he received from critics. Other circumstances conspired to dampen Mussorgsky&#x27;s spirits. The disintegration of The Mighty Handful and their failure to understand his artistic goals contributed to the isolation he experienced as an outsider in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s musical establishment. Golenishchev-Kutuzov wrote: &quot;[The Mighty Handful&#x27;s] banner was held by Mussorgsky alone; all the other members had left it and pursued his own path ...&quot;

Hartmann&#x27;s sudden death on 4 August 1873 from an aneurysm shook Mussorgsky along with others in Russia&#x27;s art world. The loss of the artist, aged only 39, plunged the composer into deep despair. Stasov helped to organize a memorial exhibition of over 400 Hartmann works in the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg in February and March 1874. Mussorgsky lent to the exhibition the two pictures Hartmann had given him, and viewed the show in person. Later in June, two-thirds of the way through composing his song cycle &quot;Sunless&quot;, Mussorgsky was inspired to compose &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, quickly completing the score in three weeks (2–22 June 1874). In a letter to Stasov (see photo), probably written on 12 June 1874, he describes his progress:

 The music depicts his tour of the exhibition, with each of the ten numbers of the suite serving as a musical illustration of an individual work by Hartmann.

Five days after finishing the composition, he wrote on the title page of the manuscript a tribute to Vladimir Stasov, to whom the work is dedicated. One month later, he added an indication that he intended to have it published.

Golenishchev-Kutuzov gives the following (perhaps biased) account of the work&#x27;s reception among Mussorgsky&#x27;s friends and colleagues and an explanation for his failure to follow through on his plans to publish it:

In August, Mussorgsky completed the last two songs of &quot;Sunless&quot; and then resumed work on &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;, composing the prelude to Act 1 (&quot;Dawn on the Moscow River&quot;) in September.

==Publication history==

As with most of Mussorgsky&#x27;s works, &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; has a complicated publication history. Although composed very rapidly, during June 1874, the work did not appear in print until 1886, five years after the composer&#x27;s death, when an edition by the composer&#x27;s friend and colleague Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov was published. This edition, however, was not a completely accurate representation of Mussorgsky&#x27;s score but presented a revised text that contained a number of errors and misreadings.

Only in 1931, marking the 50th anniversary of the composer&#x27;s death, was &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; published in a scholarly edition in agreement with his manuscript, to be included in Volume 8 of Pavel Lamm&#x27;s &quot;M. P. Mussorgsky: Complete Collected Works&quot; (1939).

In 1940, the Italian composer Luigi Dallapiccola published an important critical edition of Mussorgsky&#x27;s work with extensive commentary.

Mussorgsky&#x27;s hand-written manuscript was published in facsimile in 1975.

==Hartmann&#x27;s pictures==

Mussorgsky based his musical material on drawings and watercolours by Hartmann produced mostly during the artist&#x27;s travels abroad. Locales include Italy, France, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine. Today most of the pictures from the Hartmann exhibition are lost, making it impossible to be sure in many cases which Hartmann works Mussorgsky had in mind.

Arts critic Alfred Frankenstein gave an account of Hartmann, with reproductions of his pictures, in the article &quot;Victor Hartmann and Modeste Mussorgsky&quot; in &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot; (July 1939). Frankenstein claimed to have identified seven pictures by catalogue number, corresponding to:
*&quot;Tuileries&quot; [Movement 3] (now lost)
*&quot;Ballet of the Unhatched Chicks&quot; [Movement 5]
*&quot;Samuel Goldenberg and Schmuÿle&quot; [Movement 6] (Frankenstein suggested two separate portraits, still extant, as the basis for &quot;Two Jews: Rich and Poor&quot;)
*&quot;Catacombs&quot; [Movement 8]
*&quot;The Hut on Hen&#x27;s Legs&quot; [Movement 9]
*&quot;The Bogatyr Gates&quot; [Movement 10]
The surviving works that can be shown with certainty to have been used by Mussorgsky in assembling his suite, along with their titles, are as follows:
&quot;Note:&quot; Mussorgsky owned the two pictures that together inspired No. 6, the so-called &quot;Two Jews&quot;. The title of No. 6b, as provided by the Soviet editors of his letters, is Сандомирский [еврей] (&quot;Sandomirskiy [yevrey]&quot; or &quot;Sandomierz [Jew]&quot;). The bracketed word &quot;yevrey&quot; ( &quot;Hebrew&quot;) is the sanitized form of the actual word in the title, very likely the derogatory epithet жид (&quot;zhid&quot; or &quot;yid&quot;).

==Movements==
Vladimir Stasov&#x27;s program, identified below, and the six known extant pictures suggest the ten pieces that make up the suite correspond to eleven pictures by Hartmann, with &quot;Samuel Goldenberg und Schmuÿle&quot; accounting for two. The five Promenades are not numbered with the ten pictures and consist in the composer&#x27;s manuscript of two titled movements and three untitled interludes appended to the first, second, and fourth pictures.

Mussorgsky links the suite&#x27;s movements in a way that depicts the viewer&#x27;s own progress through the exhibition. Two Promenade movements stand as portals to the suite&#x27;s main sections. Their regular pace and irregular meter depict the act of walking. Three untitled interludes present shorter statements of this theme, varying the mood, colour, and key in each to suggest reflection on a work just seen or anticipation of a new work glimpsed. A turn is taken in the work at the &quot;Catacombae&quot; when the Promenade theme stops functioning as merely a linking device and becomes, in &quot;Cum mortuis&quot;, an integral element of the movement itself. The theme reaches its apotheosis in the suite&#x27;s finale, &quot;The Bogatyr Gates&quot;.

The first two movements of the suite—one grand, one grotesque—find mirrored counterparts, and apotheoses, at the end. The suite traces a journey that begins at an art exhibition, but the line between observer and observed vanishes at the Catacombs when the journey takes on a different character.

The table below shows the order of movements.

===Promenade===
Vladimir Stasov&#x27;s comment: In this piece Mussorgsky depicts himself &quot;roving through the exhibition, now leisurely, now briskly in order to come close to a picture that had attracted his attention, and at times sadly, thinking of his departed friend.&quot;

The piece has simple, strong rhythms in asymmetrical meter. The promenade theme is shown below:

===1. The Gnome===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;A sketch depicting a little gnome, clumsily running with crooked legs.&quot;

Hartmann&#x27;s sketch, now lost, is thought to represent a design for a nutcracker displaying large teeth. The lurching music, in contrasting tempos with frequent stops and starts, suggests the movements of the gnome.

===Promenade (2nd)===
A placid statement of the promenade melody depicts the viewer walking from one display to the next.

===2. The Old Castle===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;A medieval castle before which a troubadour sings a song.&quot;

This movement is thought to be based on a watercolor depiction of an Italian castle and is portrayed in Ravel&#x27;s orchestration by a bassoon and alto saxophone duet. Hartmann often placed appropriate human figures in his architectural renderings to suggest scale.

===Promenade (3rd)===
Another brief statement of the promenade melody (8 measures) gives it more extroversion and weight than before.

===3. Tuileries (Children&#x27;s Quarrel after Games)===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;An avenue in the garden of the Tuileries, with a swarm of children and nurses.&quot;

Hartmann&#x27;s picture of the Jardin des Tuileries near the Louvre in Paris (France) is now lost. Figures of children quarrelling and playing in the garden were likely added by the artist for scale (see note on No. 2 above).

The movement is cast in through-composed ternary form (ABA).

===4. Cattle===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;A Polish cart on enormous wheels, drawn by oxen.&quot;

The movement is cast in through-composed ternary form (ABA) with coda. Mussorgsky&#x27;s original piano version of this movement begins &quot;fortissimo&quot; (), suggesting that the lumbering oxcart&#x27;s journey begins in the listener&#x27;s foreground. After reaching a climax (&quot;con tutta forza&quot;), the dynamic marking is abruptly &quot;piano&quot; (bar 47), followed by a &quot;diminuendo&quot; to a final &quot;pianississimo&quot; (), suggesting the oxcart receding into the distance. Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s edition, and arrangements based on it such as Ravel&#x27;s, begin quietly, build gradually (&quot;crescendo&quot;) to &quot;fortissimo&quot; and then undergo a &quot;diminuendo&quot;, suggesting the oxcart approaching, passing the listener, and then receding.

===Promenade (4th)===
A reflective 10-measure presentation of the promenade theme.

===5. Ballet of Unhatched Chicks===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;Hartmann&#x27;s design for the décor of a picturesque scene in the ballet &quot;Trilby&quot;.&quot;

Gerald Abraham provides the following details: &quot;&quot;Trilby&quot; or &quot;The Demon of the Heath&quot;, a ballet with choreography by Petipa, music by Julius Gerber, and décor by Hartmann, based on Charles Nodier&#x27;s &quot;Trilby&quot;, or &quot;The Elf of Argyle&quot;, was produced at the Bolshoi Theatre, Saint Petersburg, in 1871. The fledglings were canary chicks.&quot;

The movement is cast in ternary form (ABA) with a literal repeat and terse extension (coda).

=== 6. &quot;Samuel&quot; Goldenberg and &quot;Schmuÿle&quot; ===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;Two Jews: rich and poor&quot; ()

Stasov&#x27;s explanatory title elucidates the personal names used in Mussorgsky&#x27;s original manuscript. Published versions display various combinations, such as &quot;Two Polish Jews, Rich and Poor (Samuel Goldenberg and Schmuyle)&quot;. The movement is thought to be based on two separate extant portraits.

The use of augmented second intervals approximates Jewish modes such as the Phrygian dominant scale. The movement is in ternary form :

*Andante, grave energico (Theme 1 &quot;Samuel Goldenberg&quot;)
*Andantino (Theme 2 &quot;Schmuÿle&quot;)
*Andante, grave energico (Themes 1 and 2 in counterpoint)
*Coda
===Promenade (5th)===

A nearly bar-for-bar restatement of the opening promenade. Differences are slight: condensed second half, block chords voiced more fully. Structurally, the movement acts as a reprise, giving listeners another hearing of the opening material before these are developed in the second half of the suite.

Many arrangements, including Ravel&#x27;s orchestral version, omit this movement.

===7. Limoges. The Market (The Great News)===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;French women quarrelling violently in the market.&quot;

Limoges is a city in central France. Mussorgsky originally provided two paragraphs in French that described a marketplace discussion (the &#x27;great news&#x27;), but subsequently crossed them out in the manuscript.

The movement is a scherzo in through-composed ternary form (ABA). A scurrying coda leads without a break into the next movement.

=== 8. Catacombs (Roman Tomb) – With the Dead in a Dead Language ===

Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;Hartmann represented himself examining the Paris catacombs by the light of a lantern.&quot;

The movement is in two distinct parts. Its two sections consist of a nearly static Largo consisting of a sequence of block chords with elegiac lines adding a touch of melancholy and a more flowing, gloomy Andante that introduces the Promenade theme into the scene.

The first section&#x27;s alternating loud and soft chords evoke the grandeur, stillness, and echo of the catacombs. The second section suggests a merging of observer and scene as the observer descends into the catacombs. Mussorgsky&#x27;s manuscript of &quot;Catacombs&quot; (shown right) displays two pencilled notes, in Russian: &quot;NB – Latin text: With the dead in a dead language&quot; and, along the right margin, &quot;Well may it be in Latin! The creative spirit of the dead Hartmann leads me towards the skulls, invokes them; the skulls begin to glow softly.&quot;

===9. The Hut on Hen&#x27;s Legs (Baba Yaga)===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;Hartmann&#x27;s drawing depicted a clock in the form of Baba Yaga&#x27;s hut on hen&#x27;s legs. Mussorgsky added the witch&#x27;s flight in a mortar.&quot;

A scherzo marked &quot;Feroce&quot; with a slower middle section. Motives in this movement evoke the bells of a large clock and the whirlwind sounds of a chase. Structurally, the movement mirrors the grotesque qualities of &quot;Gnomus&quot; on a grand scale.

The movement is cast in ternary form (ABA):

*Allegro con brio, feroce
*Andante mosso
*Allegro molto (a nearly literal repeat)
*Coda

The coda leads without a break into the final movement of the suite.

===10. The Bogatyr Gates (In the Capital in Kiev)===
Stasov&#x27;s comment: &quot;Hartmann&#x27;s sketch was his design for city gates at Kiev in the ancient Russian massive style with a cupola shaped like a slavonic helmet.&quot;

Bogatyrs are heroes that appear in Russian epics called &quot;bylinas&quot;. Hartmann designed a monumental gate for Tsar Alexander II to commemorate the monarch&#x27;s narrow escape from an assassination attempt on April 4, 1866. Hartmann regarded his design as the best work he had done. His design won the national competition but plans to build the structure were later cancelled.

The movement&#x27;s grand main theme exalts the opening Promenade much as &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; amplified &quot;Gnomus&quot;; also like that movement, it evens out the meter of its earlier counterpart. The solemn secondary theme is based on a baptismal hymn from the repertory of Russian Orthodox chant.

The movement is cast as a broad rondo in two main sections: ABAB–CADA. The first half of the movement sets up the expectation of an ABABA pattern. The interruption of this pattern with new music just before its expected conclusion gives the rest of the movement the feeling of a vast extension. This extended leave-taking acts as a coda for the suite as a whole.

*A: Main Theme (&quot;forte&quot;, then &quot;fortissimo&quot;); maestoso

== Recording of the original manuscript ==
In 2009, the German pianist published the original version of Gnomus on his Mussorgsky album (Enharmonic) as a premiere. In 2014, the Russian pianist Andrej Hoteev presented (in a CD recording) a performance of &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; based on original manuscripts he consulted in the Russian National Library at Saint Petersburg. Hoteev found numerous discrepancies with conventional sheet music editions. He believes his recorded version expresses the composer&#x27;s original intent. The most important deviations are documented with illustrations from the manuscripts in the accompanying CD booklet.

Further notable recordings exist from Theodore Kuchar, Valery Gergiev, Rafael Kubelík, Fritz Reiner and Riccardo Muti.

==Arrangements and interpretations==

The first musician to arrange Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; for orchestra was the Russian composer and conductor Mikhail Tushmalov. However, his version (first performed in 1891 and possibly produced as early as 1886 when he was a student of Rimsky-Korsakov) does not include the entire suite: Only seven of the ten &quot;pictures&quot; are present, leaving out &quot;Gnomus&quot;, &quot;Tuileries&quot;, and &quot;Cattle&quot;, and all the Promenades are omitted except for the last one, which is used in place of the first.

The next orchestration was undertaken by the British conductor Henry Wood in 1915. He recorded a few sections of his arrangement on a pair of acoustic Columbia 78rpm discs in 1920. However, he withdrew his version when Maurice Ravel&#x27;s orchestration was published, and banned every public performance in the 1930s in deference to Ravel&#x27;s work. Wood&#x27;s arrangement has also been recorded by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Nicholas Braithwaite and issued on the Lyrita label. All but the first of the Promenade movements were omitted and other passages extensively re-composed. Wood&#x27;s orchestration was once described by Gordon Jacob as &quot;superior to Ravel&#x27;s in picturesqueness and vividness&quot;, with its off-stage camel-bells in &quot;Cattle&quot; and grand organ in &quot;The Great Gate of Kyiv&quot;.

The first person to orchestrate the piece in its entirety was the Slovenian-born conductor and violinist Leo Funtek, who finished his version in 1922 while living and working in Finland.

The version by Maurice Ravel, produced in 1922 on a commission by Serge Koussevitzky, represents a virtuoso effort by a master colourist. The orchestration has proved the most popular in the concert hall and on record.

Ravel omitted the Promenade between &quot;Samuel Goldenberg and Schmuÿle&quot; and &quot;Limoges&quot; and applied artistic license to some particulars of dynamics and notation. His instrumental colors—a trumpet solo for the opening Promenade, dark woodwind tones for passages suggesting Orthodox chant, the piccolo and high strings for the children&#x27;s &quot;chicks in shells&quot;—are widely admired. The influence of Ravel&#x27;s version may often be discerned in subsequent versions of the suite.

Koussevitzky&#x27;s commission, worked out with the publishers of the piano suite, gave him sole conducting rights for several years. He conducted the first performance in Paris on October 19, 1922. He published Ravel&#x27;s score himself and in 1930 made the first recording of it with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The exclusive nature of his commission prompted the release of a number of contemporary versions by other arrangers until Ravel&#x27;s became generally available.

The original publisher of Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano suite, W. Bessel &amp; Co. rushed to produce an orchestral version of its own after Ravel&#x27;s proved popular. The publisher had passed on the opportunity to publish Ravel&#x27;s arrangement, seeing no great commercial advantage in printing a score and set of parts for large orchestra; it had granted Koussevitzky permission to commission the setting and publish the score himself on the condition that no one else be allowed to perform it. Bessel turned to a Ravel student, 21-year-old Russian-born pianist Leonidas Leonardi (1901–1967), a.k.a. Leon Leonardi or Leonid Leonardi, to create an orchestral version that could meet the now burgeoning demand and help the publisher regain some of its lost advantage. Leonardi&#x27;s orchestration requires even larger forces than the version made by his mentor. The young pianist dedicated his setting of the suite to Igor Stravinsky and conducted the premiere in Paris with the Lamoureux Orchestra on 15 June 1924. The US premiere took place on 4 December 1924 when the New York Symphony Orchestra performed it under the baton of Walter Damrosch. Regardless, Leonardi&#x27;s orchestration was soon eclipsed by Ravel&#x27;s, and today only the third Promenade and &quot;Tuileries&quot; movement of his version may be heard on audio record (Leonard Slatkin/Saint Louis Symphony: &quot;The Slatkin Years: 6 CD Set&quot;).

Another arrangement appeared when Eugene Ormandy took over the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1936 following Leopold Stokowski&#x27;s decision to resign the conductorship. Ormandy wanted a version of &quot;Pictures&quot; of his own and commissioned Lucien Cailliet, the Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s &#x27;house arranger&#x27; and player in the woodwind section, to produce one. This version was premiered and recorded by Ormandy in 1937. Walter Goehr published a version in 1942 for smaller forces than Ravel but curiously dropped &quot;Gnomus&quot; altogether and made &quot;Limoges&quot; the first piece.

The conductor Leopold Stokowski had introduced Ravel&#x27;s version to Philadelphia audiences in November 1929; ten years later, he produced his own very free orchestration (incorporating much re-composition), aiming for what he called a more Slavic orchestral sound instead of Ravel&#x27;s more Gallic approach. Stokowski revised his version over the years and made three gramophone recordings of it (1939, 1941 and 1965). The score, finally published in 1971, has since been recorded by other conductors, including Matthias Bamert, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Oliver Knussen and José Serebrier.

Although Ravel&#x27;s version is most often performed and recorded, a number of conductors have made their own changes to the scoring, including Arturo Toscanini, Nikolai Golovanov, and James Conlon. Conductor and pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy produced his own orchestral arrangement, expressing dissatisfaction with Ravel&#x27;s interpretive liberties and perpetuation of early printing errors. The conductor Leonard Slatkin has performed compendium versions, in which each Promenade and picture is interpreted by a different orchestral arranger.

Many other orchestrations and arrangements of &quot;Pictures&quot; have been made. Most show debts to Ravel; the original piano composition is, of course, frequently performed and recorded. A version for chamber orchestra exists, made by Taiwanese composer Chao Ching-Wen. Elgar Howarth arranged it for the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble in 1977, subsequently recasting it for Grimethorpe Colliery Band. Kazuhito Yamashita wrote an adaptation for solo classical guitar. Excerpts have also been recorded, including a 78 rpm disc of &quot;The Old Castle&quot; and &quot;Catacombs&quot; orchestrated by Sir Granville Bantock, and a spectacular version of &quot;The Great Gate of Kyiv&quot; was scored by Douglas Gamley for full symphony orchestra, male voice choir and organ. The Amadeus Orchestra (UK) commissioned ten composers to orchestrate one movement each to make a version first performed complete in 2012. Movements were provided by Alastair King, Roger May, Tolib Shakhidi, David Butterworth, Philip Mackenzie, Simon Whiteside, Daryl Griffiths, Natalia Villanueva, James McWilliam and Julian Kershaw.

The suite has inspired homages in a broad range of musical styles. Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s version incorporated elements of progressive rock, jazz and folk music (1971/2008). An electronic music adaptation by Isao Tomita was done in 1975. A heavy metal arrangement of the entire suite was released by German band Mekong Delta; another metal band, Armored Saint, utilised the &quot;Great Gate of Kyiv&quot; theme as an introduction for the track &quot;March of the Saint&quot;. In 2002, electronic musician-composer Amon Tobin paraphrased &quot;Gnomus&quot; for the track &quot;Back From Space&quot; on his album &quot;Out from Out Where&quot;. In 2003 guitarist-composer Trevor Rabin released an electric guitar adaptation of the Promenade originally intended for the Yes album &quot;Big Generator&quot; and later included on his demo album &quot;90124&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Animusic 2&quot; included a track entitled &quot;Cathedral Pictures&quot;, which included only the first Promenade and the final two movements from the suite. The Michael Jackson song &quot;HIStory&quot; samples a short section of &quot;The Great Gate of Kiev&quot;, with a longer part featured during the HIStory World Tour 5 minute-countdown before the MJ-2040 spaceship departs, a snippet before continuing They Don&#x27;t Care About Us and in the flag parade finale in 1996/97. Re-issues of the &quot;&quot; album further changed the sample on the track. The same thing can be heard in the Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration, which during the Jacksons&#x27;s ultimate medley, after Can You Feel It, the song starts and then ABC starts.

== Stage adaptations ==

===Staging by Kandinsky===
In 1928, the Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky created a stage show by combining his own designs for the pictures with a performance of the piano score. Since it was put on at Dessau, elements of the staging have been lost. However, it has proved possible to animate the surviving art work using video technology.

===Staging by Gen Atem and S213===
In a hall on Attisholz-Areal, Switzerland, Gen Atem and S213 had a premiere performance on the basis of Ravel&#x27;s orchestration of Mussorgsky&#x27;s piano cycle in August 2021. Kaspar Zehnder and the Theatre Orchester Biel Solothurn provided the acoustical background in its entirety.

===Ballet by Alexei Ratmansky===
In 2014, choreographer Alexei Ratmansky created the ballet &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, based on the orchestral score, for the New York City Ballet. The set featured a 1913 painting by Wassily Kandinsky, unrelated to Kandinsky’s 1928 staging.

<doc id="183045" wikidata="Q732141" url="?curid=183045" title="Hyperbolic spiral">
<text>A hyperbolic spiral is a type of spiral with a pitch angle that increases with distance from its center, unlike the constant angles of logarithmic spirals or decreasing angles of Archimedean spirals. As this curve widens, it approaches an asymptotic line. It can be found in the view up a spiral staircase and the starting arrangement of certain footraces, and is used to model spiral galaxies and architectural volutes.

As a plane curve, a hyperbolic spiral can be described in polar coordinates formula_1 by the equation
formula_2
for an arbitrary choice of the scale factor formula_3

Because of the reciprocal relation between formula_4 and formula_5 it is also called a reciprocal spiral. The same relation between Cartesian coordinates would describe a hyperbola, and the hyperbolic spiral was first discovered by applying the equation of a hyperbola to polar coordinates. Hyperbolic spirals can also be generated as the inverse curves of Archimedean spirals, or as the central projections of helixes.

Hyperbolic spirals are patterns in the Euclidean plane, and should not be confused with other kinds of spirals drawn in the hyperbolic plane. In cases where the name of these spirals might be ambiguous, their alternative name, reciprocal spirals, can be used instead.

==History and applications==
Pierre Varignon first studied the hyperbolic spiral in 1704, as an example of the &quot;polar curve&quot; obtained from another curve (in this case the hyperbola) by reinterpreting the Cartesian coordinates of points on the given curve as polar coordinates of points on the polar curve. Varignon and later James Clerk Maxwell were interested in the roulettes obtained by tracing a point on this curve as it rolls along another curve; for instance, when a hyperbolic spiral rolls along a straight line, its center traces out a tractrix.

Johann Bernoulli and Roger Cotes also wrote about this curve, in connection with Isaac Newton&#x27;s discovery that bodies that follow conic section trajectories must be subject to an inverse-square law, such as the one in Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation. Newton asserted that the reverse was true: that conic sections were the only trajectories possible under an inverse-square law. Bernoulli criticized this step, observing that in the case of an inverse-cube law, multiple trajectories were possible, including both a logarithmic spiral (whose connection to the inverse-cube law was already observed by Newton) and a hyperbolic spiral. Cotes found a family of spirals, the Cotes&#x27;s spirals, including the logarithmic and hyperbolic spirals, that all required an inverse-cube law. By 1720, Newton had resolved the controversy by proving that inverse-square laws always produce conic-section trajectories.
For a hyperbolic spiral with a circular arc centered at the origin, continuing clockwise for from any of its points, will end on the Because of this equal-length property, the starting marks of 200m and 400m footraces are placed in staggered positions along a hyperbolic spiral. This ensures that the runners, restricted to their concentric lanes, all have equal-length paths to the finish line. For longer races where runners move to the inside lane after the start, a different spiral (the involute of a circle) is used instead.
The increasing pitch angle of the hyperbolic spiral, as a function of distance from its center, has led to the use of these spirals to model the shapes of some spiral galaxies, which in some cases have a similarly increasing pitch angle. However, this model does not provide a good fit to the shapes of all spiral galaxies. In architecture, it has been suggested that hyperbolic spirals are a good match for the design of volutes from columns of the Corinthian order. It also describes the perspective view up the axis of a spiral staircase or other helical structure.

Along with the Archimedean and logarithmic spiral, the hyperbolic spiral has been used in psychological experiments on the perception of rotation.

==Constructions==
===Coordinate equations===
The hyperbolic spiral has the equation
formula_6
for polar coordinates formula_1 and scale coefficient formula_8. It can be represented in Cartesian coordinates by applying the standard polar-to-Cartesian conversions formula_9 obtaining a parametric equation for the Cartesian coordinates of this curve that treats formula_5 as a parameter rather than as a coordinate:
formula_11
Relaxing the constraint that formula_12 to formula_13 and using the same equations produces a reflected copy of the spiral, and some sources treat these two copies as &quot;branches&quot; of a single curve.

The hyperbolic spiral is a transcendental curve, meaning that it cannot be defined from a polynomial equation of its Cartesian coordinates. However, one can obtain a trigonometric equation in these coordinates by starting with its polar defining equation in the form formula_14 and replacing its variables according to the Cartesian-to-polar conversions formula_15 and giving:
formula_16

It is also possible to use the polar equation to define a spiral curve in the hyperbolic plane, but this is different in some important respects from the usual form of the hyperbolic spiral in the Euclidean plane. In particular, the corresponding curve in the hyperbolic plane does not have an asymptotic line.

=== Inversion ===

Circle inversion through the unit circle is a transformation of the plane that, in polar coordinates, maps the point formula_1 (excluding the origin) to formula_18 and vice versa. The image of an Archimedean spiral formula_19 under this transformation (its inverse curve) is the hyperbolic spiral with 

=== Central projection of a helix ===

The central projection of a helix onto a plane perpendicular to the axis of the helix describes the view that one would see of the guardrail of a spiral staircase, looking up or down from a viewpoint on the axis of the staircase. To model this projection mathematically, consider the central projection from point formula_20 onto the image This will map a point formula_21 to the 

The image under this projection of the helix with parametric representation
formula_22
is the curve
formula_23
with the polar equation
formula_24
which describes a hyperbolic spiral.

== Properties ==
=== Asymptotes ===
The hyperbolic spiral approaches the origin as an asymptotic point. Because
formula_25
the curve has an asymptotic line with 

=== Pitch angle ===

From vector calculus in polar coordinates one gets the formula formula_26 for the pitch angle formula_27 between the tangent of any curve and the tangent of its corresponding polar circle. For the hyperbolic spiral formula_28 the pitch angle is
formula_29

=== Curvature ===
The curvature of any curve with polar equation formula_30 is
formula_31
From the equation formula_32 and its derivatives formula_33 and formula_34 one gets the curvature of a hyperbolic spiral, in terms of the radius formula_4 or of the angle formula_5 of any of its points:
formula_37

=== Arc length ===
The length of the arc of a hyperbolic spiral formula_32 between the points formula_39 and formula_40 can be calculated by the integral:
formula_41
Here, the bracket notation means to calculate the formula within the brackets for both formula_42 and formula_43, and to subtract the result for formula_42 from the result for formula_43.

=== Sector area ===
The area of a sector (see diagram above) of a hyperbolic spiral with equation formula_32 is:
formula_47
That is, the area is proportional to the difference in radii, with constant of proportionality

<doc id="183046" wikidata="Q1359655" url="?curid=183046" title="East Asian tea ceremony">
<text>Tea ceremony is a ritualized practice of making and serving tea (茶 &quot;cha&quot;) in East Asia practiced in the Sinosphere. The original term from China (), literally translated as either &quot;&quot;way of tea&quot;, &quot;etiquette for tea or tea rite&quot;&quot;, or &quot;art of tea&quot; among the languages in the Sinosphere, is a cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of tea. Korean, Vietnamese and Japanese tea culture were inspired by the Chinese tea culture during ancient and medieval times, particularly after the successful transplant of the tea plant from Tang China to Korea, Vietnam and Japan by traveling Buddhist monks and scholars in 8th century and onwards.

One can also refer to the whole set of rituals, tools, gestures, etc. used in such ceremonies as tea culture. All of these tea ceremonies and rituals contain &quot;an adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday life&quot;, as well as refinement, an inner spiritual content, humility, restraint and simplicity &quot;as all arts that partake the extraordinary, an artistic artificiality, abstractness, symbolism and formalism&quot; to one degree or another.

At the very rudimentary level, East Asian tea ceremonies are a formalized way of making tea, in a process that has been refined to yield the best taste. Historical classics on the subject include the 8th-century Chinese monograph &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot; ( &quot;Chájīng&quot;) and the 12th-century Chinese book &quot;Treatise on Tea&quot; ( &quot;Dàguān Chálùn&quot;).

==In East Asia==
===China===

In China, a tea house (茶室 &quot;cháshì&quot;, 茶館 &quot;cháguăn&quot; or 茶屋 &quot;cháwū&quot;) is traditionally similar to a coffeehouse, albeit offering tea rather than coffee. People gather at tea houses to chat, socialize, play &quot;xiangqi&quot; or &quot;Go&quot; (&quot;weiqi&quot;), and enjoy tea, and young people often meet at tea houses for dates. Tea ceremonies are often performed during business meetings.

===Japan===

In Japanese tradition a tea house ordinarily refers to a private structure called a &quot;chashitsu&quot; () designed for holding Japanese tea ceremonies. This structure and specifically the room in it where the tea ceremony takes place is called with its entrance called a &quot;roji&quot; (露地). The architectural space called &quot;chashitsu&quot; was created for aesthetic and intellectual fulfillment. In Japan, a tea ceremony is a blend of two principles, sabi (寂) and wabi (侘). &quot;Wabi&quot; represents the inner, or spiritual, experiences of human lives. Its original meaning indicated quiet or sober refinement, or subdued taste &quot;characterized by humility, restraint, simplicity, naturalism, profundity, imperfection, and asymmetry&quot; and &quot;emphasizes simple, unadorned objects and architectural space, and celebrates the mellow beauty that time and care to impart to materials.&quot; &quot;Sabi,&quot; on the other hand, represents the outer, or material imperfection of life, also the original nature of things. Zen Buddhism has been an influence in the development of the tea ceremony. The elements of the Japanese tea ceremony are the harmony of nature and self-cultivation and enjoying tea in a formal and informal setting. The Japanese tea ceremony developed as a &quot;transformative practice&quot;, and began to evolve its own aesthetic, in particular, that of &quot;sabis&quot; and &quot;wabis&quot; principles. Understanding emptiness was considered the most effective means to spiritual awakening while embracing imperfection was honored as a healthy reminder to cherish our unpolished selves, here and now, just as we are – the first step to &quot;Satori&quot; or Enlightenment. Tea drinking is used as an aid to meditation, for assistance in fortune telling, for ceremonial purposes and in the expression of the arts.

The Japanese tea garden was created during the Muromachi period (1333–1573) and Momoyama period (1573–1600) as a setting for the Japanese tea ceremony, or &quot;chadō&quot; (茶道). The style of the garden takes its name from the roji, or path to the teahouse, which is supposed to inspire the visitor to meditate to prepare him for the ceremony. There is an outer garden, with a gate and covered arbor where guests wait for the invitation to enter. They then pass through a gate to the inner garden, where they wash their hands and rinse their mouth, as they would before entering a Shinto shrine, before going into the teahouse itself. The path is always kept moist and green, so it will look like a remote mountain path, and there are no bright flowers that might distract the visitor from his meditation. Early tea houses had no windows, but later teahouses have a wall that can be opened for a view of the garden.

===Korea===

In Korea, the traditional Korean tea ceremony or Darye (다례; 茶禮), which is central to the Korean approach to tea, developed as Koreans cultivated, refined, and drank tea for thousands of years. The oldest surviving official record dates back to 8th century detailing Shilla and Gaya Confederacy monarchs and royal families holding tea ceremonies at palaces and temples. The practice continued and flourished during Goryeo and was refined during the Joseon dynasty.

The decline of Joseon and the colonial rule of Korea contributed to suppression of its traditional tea ceremony and even overtaking by Japanese tea ceremony. Moreover, after liberation from Japanese rule, Korean tea ceremony suffered further from the ravages of the Korean War.

However, various farmers, artisans, entrepreneurs, scholars, scientists, and community leaders of Korea endeavored and persisted in keeping the Korean way of tea alive during and beyond those highly unstable times.

The contemporary Darye is more straightforward and relaxed compared to the Chinese and Japanese counterparts. Sincere attentiveness from the host in order to maximize the guest&#x27;s comfort is considered paramount.

Korean tea ceremonies today are held in teahouses or Dawon (다원) and they feature a not only a variety of teas but also herbal infusions. They tend to be flexible and adaptive in choice and design of teaware used, minimalist in proceedings taken, and tea may be accompanied by traditional snacks and sweets or Dasik (다식) and Dagwa (다과).

== Outside East Asia ==
Corresponding tea-drinking habits can be found worldwide. In the United Kingdom, including the Victorian-era afternoon tea or tea party ritual, was a social event, where the ritual of being seen to have the right equipment, manners, and social circle, was just as important as the drink itself. The Victorian-era tea was also influenced by the Indian tea culture, as for the choice of tea varieties.

In the United States, American tea culture has roots that trace back to the Dutch colonization of the Americas. In the colonies, teas were served with silver strainers, fine porcelain cups and pots and exquisite tea caddies. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in fine teas in the United States, mainly due to the lifting of China&#x27;s ban on exports in 1971. From the 1920s to 1971, Americans could not get much Chinese tea and very little Indian tea was imported.

<text>Thrombosis () is the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. When a blood vessel (a vein or an artery) is injured, the body uses platelets (thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss. Even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. A clot, or a piece of the clot, that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an embolus.

Thrombosis may occur in veins (venous thrombosis) or in arteries (arterial thrombosis). Venous thrombosis (sometimes called DVT, deep vein thrombosis) leads to a blood clot in the affected part of the body, while arterial thrombosis (and, rarely, severe venous thrombosis) affects the blood supply and leads to damage of the tissue supplied by that artery (ischemia and necrosis). A piece of either an arterial or a venous thrombus can break off as an embolus, which could then travel through the circulation and lodge somewhere else as an embolism. This type of embolism is known as a thromboembolism. Complications can arise when a venous thromboembolism (commonly called a VTE) lodges in the lung as a pulmonary embolism. An arterial embolus may travel further down the affected blood vessel, where it can lodge as an embolism.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Thrombosis is generally defined by the type of blood vessel affected (arterial or venous thrombosis) and the precise location of the blood vessel or the organ supplied by it.

=== Venous thrombosis ===
==== Deep vein thrombosis ====

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein. It most commonly affects leg veins, such as the femoral vein.

Three factors are important in the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein—these are:
* the rate of blood flow,
* the thickness of the blood and
* qualities of the vessel wall.

Classical signs of DVT include swelling, pain and redness of the affected area.

==== Paget-Schroetter disease ====

Paget-Schroetter disease or upper extremity DVT (UEDVT) is the obstruction of an arm vein (such as the axillary vein or subclavian vein) by a thrombus. The condition usually comes to light after vigorous exercise and usually presents in younger, otherwise healthy people. Men are affected more than women.

==== Budd-Chiari syndrome ====

Budd-Chiari syndrome is the blockage of a hepatic vein or of the hepatic part of the inferior vena cava. This form of thrombosis presents with abdominal pain, ascites and enlarged liver. Treatment varies between therapy and surgical intervention by the use of shunts.

==== Portal vein thrombosis ====

Portal vein thrombosis affects the hepatic portal vein, which can lead to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver. It usually happens in the setting of another disease such as pancreatitis, cirrhosis, diverticulitis or cholangiocarcinoma.

==== Renal vein thrombosis ====

Renal vein thrombosis is the obstruction of the renal vein by a thrombus. This tends to lead to reduced drainage from the kidney.

==== Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis ====

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare form of stroke which results from the blockage of the dural venous sinuses by a thrombus. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body and seizures. The diagnosis is usually made with a CT or MRI scan. The majority of persons affected make a full recovery. The mortality rate is 4.3%.

==== Jugular vein thrombosis ====
Jugular vein thrombosis is a condition that may occur due to infection, intravenous drug use or malignancy. Jugular vein thrombosis can have a varying list of complications, including: systemic sepsis, pulmonary embolism, and papilledema. Though characterized by a sharp pain at the site of the vein, it can prove difficult to diagnose, because it can occur at random.

==== Cavernous sinus thrombosis ====

Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a specialised form of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, where there is thrombosis of the cavernous sinus of the basal skull dura, due to the retrograde spread of infection and endothelial damage from the danger triangle of the face. The facial veins in this area anastomose with the superior and inferior ophthalmic veins of the orbit, which drain directly posteriorly into the cavernous sinus through the superior orbital fissure. Staphyloccoal or Streptococcal infections of the face, for example nasal or upper lip pustules may thus spread directly into the cavernous sinus, causing stroke-like symptoms of double vision, squint, as well as spread of infection to cause meningitis.

=== Arterial thrombosis ===

Arterial thrombosis is the formation of a thrombus within an artery. In most cases, arterial thrombosis follows rupture of atheroma (a fat-rich deposit in the blood vessel wall), and is therefore referred to as &quot;atherothrombosis&quot;. Arterial embolism occurs when clots then migrate downstream and can affect any organ. Alternatively, arterial occlusion occurs as a consequence of embolism of blood clots originating from the heart (&quot;cardiogenic&quot; emboli). The most common cause is atrial fibrillation, which causes a blood stasis within the atria with easy thrombus formation, but blood clots can develop inside the heart for other reasons too as infective endocarditis.

==== Stroke ====
A stroke is the rapid decline of brain function due to a disturbance in the supply of blood to the brain. This can be due to ischemia, thrombus, embolus (a lodged particle) or hemorrhage (a bleed).

In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, the onset of symptomatic thrombotic strokes is slower. Thrombotic stroke can be divided into two categories — large vessel disease or small vessel disease. The former affects vessels such as the internal carotids, vertebral and the circle of Willis. The latter can affect smaller vessels, such as the branches of the circle of Willis.

==== Myocardial infarction ====

Myocardial infarction (MI), or heart attack, is caused by ischemia (restriction in the blood supply), which is often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus. This restriction gives an insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle which then results in tissue death (infarction). A lesion is then formed which is the infarct. MI can quickly become fatal if emergency medical treatment is not received promptly. If diagnosed within 12 hours of the initial episode (attack) then thrombolytic therapy is initiated.

===Limb ischemia===
An arterial thrombus or embolus can also form in the limbs, which can lead to acute limb ischemia.

==== Other sites ====
Hepatic artery thrombosis usually occurs as a devastating complication after liver transplantation.

==Causes==
Thrombosis prevention is initiated with assessing the risk for its development. Some people have a higher risk of developing thrombosis and its possible development into thromboembolism. Some of these risk factors are related to inflammation.

&quot;Virchow&#x27;s triad&quot; has been suggested to describe the three factors necessary for the formation of thrombosis:
* hemodynamic changes (blood stasis or turbulence),
* vessel wall (endothelial) injury/dysfunction, and
* altered blood coagulation (hypercoagulability).

Some risk factors predispose for venous thrombosis while others increase the risk of arterial thrombosis. Newborn babies in the neonatal period are also at risk of a thromboembolism.

== Mechanism ==
=== Pathogenesis ===
The main causes of thrombosis are given in Virchow&#x27;s triad which lists thrombophilia, endothelial cell injury, and disturbed blood flow. Generally speaking the risk for thrombosis increases over the life course of individuals, depending on life style factors like smoking, diet, and physical activity, the presence of other diseases like cancer or autoimmune disease, while also platelet properties change in aging individuals which is an important consideration as well.

==== Hypercoagulability ====

Hypercoagulability or &quot;thrombophilia&quot;, is caused by, for example, genetic deficiencies or autoimmune disorders. Recent studies indicate that white blood cells play a pivotal role in deep vein thrombosis, mediating numerous pro-thrombotic actions.

==== Endothelial cell injury ====
Any inflammatory process, such as trauma, surgery or infection, can cause damage to the endothelial lining of the vessel&#x27;s wall. The main mechanism is exposure of tissue factor to the blood coagulation system. Inflammatory and other stimuli (such as hypercholesterolemia) can lead to changes in gene expression in endothelium producing to a pro-thrombotic state. When this occurs, endothelial cells downregulate substances such as thrombomodulin, which is a key modulator of thrombin activity. The result is a sustained activation of thrombin and reduced production of protein C and tissue factor inhibitor, which furthers the pro-thrombotic state.

Endothelial injury is almost invariably involved in the formation of thrombi in arteries, as high rates of blood flow normally hinder clot formation. In addition, arterial and cardiac clots are normally rich in platelets–which are required for clot formation in areas under high stress due to blood flow.

==== Disturbed blood flow ====
Causes of disturbed blood flow include stagnation of blood flow past the point of injury, or venous stasis which may occur in heart failure, or after long periods of sedentary behaviour, such as sitting on a long airplane flight. Also, atrial fibrillation, causes stagnant blood in the left atrium (LA), or left atrial appendage (LAA), and can lead to a thromboembolism. Cancers or malignancies such as leukemia may cause increased risk of thrombosis by possible activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances (paraneoplastic syndrome), by external compression on a blood vessel when a solid tumor is present, or (more rarely) extension into the vasculature (for example, renal cell cancers extending into the renal veins). Also, treatments for cancer (radiation, chemotherapy) often cause additional hypercoagulability. There are scores that correlate different aspects of patient data (comorbidities, vital signs, and others) to risk of thrombosis, such as the POMPE-C, which stratifies risk of mortality due to pulmonary embolism in patients with cancer, who typically have higher rates of thrombosis. Also, there are several predictive scores for thromboembolic events, such as Padua, Khorana, and ThroLy score.

=== Pathophysiology ===

==== Natural history ====
Fibrinolysis is the physiological breakdown of blood clots by enzymes such as plasmin.

Organisation: following the thrombotic event, residual vascular thrombus will be re-organised histologically with several possible outcomes. For an occlusive thrombus (defined as thrombosis within a small vessel that leads to complete occlusion), wound healing will reorganise the occlusive thrombus into collagenous scar tissue, where the scar tissue will either permanently obstruct the vessel, or contract down with myofibroblastic activity to unblock the lumen. For a mural thrombus (defined as a thrombus in a large vessel that restricts the blood flow but does not occlude completely), histological reorganisation of the thrombus does not occur via the classic wound healing mechanism. Instead, the platelet-derived growth factor degranulated by the clotted platelets will attract a layer of smooth muscle cells to cover the clot, and this layer of mural smooth muscle will be vascularised by the blood inside the vessel lumen rather than by the vasa vasorum.

Ischemia/infarction: if an arterial thrombus cannot be lysed by the body and it does not embolise, and if the thrombus is large enough to impair or occlude blood flow in the involved artery, then local ischemia or infarction will result. A venous thrombus may or may not be ischemic, since veins distribute deoxygenated blood that is less vital for cellular metabolism. Nevertheless, non-ischemic venous thrombosis may still be problematic, due to the swelling caused by blockage to venous drainage. In deep vein thrombosis this manifests as pain, redness, and swelling; in retinal vein occlusion this may result in macular oedema and visual acuity impairment, which if severe enough can lead to blindness.

==== Embolization ====

A thrombus may become detached and enter circulation as an embolus, finally lodging in and completely obstructing a blood vessel, which unless treated very quickly will lead to tissue necrosis (an infarction) in the area past the occlusion. Venous thrombosis can lead to pulmonary embolism when the migrated embolus becomes lodged in the lung. In people with a &quot;shunt&quot; (a connection between the pulmonary and systemic circulation), either in the heart or in the lung, a venous clot can also end up in the arteries and cause arterial embolism.

Arterial embolism can lead to obstruction of blood flow through the blood vessel that is obstructed by it, and a lack of oxygen and nutrients (ischemia) of the downstream tissue. The tissue can become irreversibly damaged, a process known as necrosis. This can affect any organ; for instance, arterial embolism of the brain is one of the causes of stroke.

== Prevention ==

The use of heparin following surgery is common if there are no issues with bleeding. Generally, a risk-benefit analysis is required, as all anticoagulants lead to an increased risk of bleeding. In people admitted to hospital, thrombosis is a major cause for complications and occasionally death. In the UK, for instance, the Parliamentary Health Select Committee heard in 2005 that the annual rate of death due to thrombosis was 25,000, with at least 50% of these being hospital-acquired. Hence &quot;thromboprophylaxis&quot; (prevention of thrombosis) is increasingly emphasized. In patients admitted for surgery, graded compression stockings are widely used, and in severe illness, prolonged immobility and in all orthopedic surgery, professional guidelines recommend low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administration, mechanical calf compression or (if all else is contraindicated and the patient has recently developed deep vein thrombosis) the insertion of a vena cava filter. In patients with medical rather than surgical illness, LMWH too is known to prevent thrombosis, and in the United Kingdom the Chief Medical Officer has issued guidance to the effect that preventative measures should be used in medical patients, in anticipation of formal guidelines.

== Treatment ==
The treatment for thrombosis depends on whether it is in a vein or an artery, the impact on the person, and the risk of complications from treatment.

===Anticoagulation===

Warfarin and vitamin K antagonists are anticoagulants that can be taken orally to reduce thromboembolic occurrence. Where a more effective response is required, heparin can be given (by injection) concomitantly. As a side effect of any anticoagulant, the risk of bleeding is increased, so the international normalized ratio of blood is monitored. Self-monitoring and self-management are safe options for competent patients, though their practice varies. In Germany, about 20% of patients were self-managed while only 1% of U.S. patients did home self-testing (according to one 2012 study). Other medications such as direct thrombin inhibitors and direct Xa inhibitors are increasingly being used instead of warfarin.

===Thrombolysis===
Thrombolysis is the pharmacological destruction of blood clots by administering thrombolytic drugs including recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, which enhances the normal destruction of blood clots by the body&#x27;s enzymes. This carries an increased risk of bleeding so is generally only used for specific situations (such as severe stroke or a massive pulmonary embolism).

===Surgery===
Arterial thrombosis may require surgery if it causes acute limb ischemia.

===Endovascular treatment===
Mechanical clot retrieval and catheter-guided thrombolysis are used in certain situations.

===Antiplatelet agents===
Arterial thrombosis is platelet-rich, and inhibition of platelet aggregation with antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin may reduce the risk of recurrence or progression.

=== Targeting ischemia/reperfusion injury ===

With reperfusion comes ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury (IRI), which paradoxically causes cell death in reperfused tissue and contributes significantly to post-reperfusion mortality and morbidity. For example, in a feline model of intestinal ischemia, four hours of ischemia resulted in less injury than three hours of ischemia followed by one hour of reperfusion. In ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), IRI contributes up to 50% of final infarct size despite timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention. This is a key reason for the continued high mortality and morbidity in these conditions, despite endovascular reperfusion treatments and continuous efforts to improve timeliness and access to these treatments. Hence, protective therapies are required to attenuate IRI alongside reperfusion in acute ischemic conditions to improve clinical outcomes. Therapeutic strategies that have potential to improve clinical outcomes in reperfused STEMI patients include remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), exenatide, and metoprolol. These have emerged amongst a multitude of cardioprotective interventions investigated with largely neutral clinical data. Of these, RIC has the most robust clinical evidence, especially in the context of STEMI, but also emerging for other indications such as acute ischemic stroke and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

=== Neonatal thrombosis ===
Treatment options for full-term and preterm babies who develop thromboembolism include expectant management (with careful observation), nitroglycerin ointment, pharmacological therapy (thrombolytics and/or anticoagulants), and surgery. The evidence supporting these treatment approaches is weak. For anticoagulant treatment, it is not clear if unfractionated and/or low molecular weight heparin treatment is effective at decreasing mortality and serious adverse events in this population. There is also insufficient evidence to understand the risk of adverse effects associated with these treatment approaches in term or preterm infants.

<text>An embolus (; : emboli; from the Greek ἔμβολος &quot;wedge&quot;, &quot;plug&quot;) is an unattached mass that travels through the bloodstream and is capable of creating blockages. When an embolus occludes a blood vessel, it is called an embolism or embolic event. There are a number of different types of emboli, including blood clots, cholesterol plaque or crystals, fat globules, gas bubbles, and foreign bodies, which can result in different types of embolisms.

The term is distinct from embolism and thromboembolism, which may be consequences of an embolus, as discussed below.

The term was coined in 1848 by Rudolf Virchow as part of his foundational research into blood clots.

== Nomenclature ==
The term embolus refers generally to any free-floating mass in the bloodstream. A related term is embolism, which describes the phenomenon of an embolus lodging in a vessel and creating a blockage. An embolism is technically a consequence of an embolus, but the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Both emboli and embolisms are usually named according to their composite substance.

In contrast to emboli, which can cause occlusion at sites distant from their points of origin, there are also non-traveling blockages that develop locally from vascular trauma and inflammation or other epithelial pathology, such as atheromata and thrombi. If these local blockages dislodge into circulation, they become emboli and if not broken down during circulation, may cause embolism(s). For example, a thromboembolism is the result of a thrombus that has broken off the interior of a blood vessel and caused a vessel blockage elsewhere in the circulation.

Details of embolism classification are discussed below.

==Classification by substance==
The physical composition of the embolic material is the defining feature for classification, and this composition reflects the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of the embolus&#x27; formation. Furthermore, different types of emboli result in different types of embolisms, each with distinct clinical characteristics.

In thromboembolism, the thrombus (blood clot) from a blood vessel is completely or partially detached from the site of thrombosis (clot). The blood flow will then carry the embolus (via blood vessels) to various parts of the body where it can block the lumen (vessel cavity) and cause vessel obstruction or occlusion. The free-moving thrombus is called an embolus. A thrombus is always attached to the vessel wall and is never freely moving in the blood circulation. This is also the key difference for pathologists to determine the cause of a blood clot, either by thrombosis or by post-mortem blood clot. Vessel obstruction will then lead to different pathological issues such as blood stasis and ischemia. However, not only thromboembolism will cause the obstruction of blood flow in vessels, but also any kind of embolism is capable of causing the same problem.

Fat embolism usually occurs when endogenous (from sources within the organism) fat tissue escapes into the blood circulation. The usual cause of fat embolism is therefore the fracture of tubular bones (such as the femur), which will lead to the leakage of fat tissue within the bone marrow into ruptured vessels. There are also exogenous (from sources of external origin) causes such as intravenous injection of emulsions.

An air embolism, on the other hand, is usually always caused by exogenic factors. This can be the rupture of alveoli, and inhaled air can be leaked into the blood vessels. Other more-common causes include the puncture of the subclavian vein by accident or during operation where there is negative pressure. Air is then sucked into the veins by the negative pressure caused by thoracic expansion during the inhalation phase of respiration. Air embolism can also happen during intravenous therapy, when air is leaked into the system (however this iatrogenic error in modern medicine is extremely rare).

Gas embolism is a common concern for deep-sea divers because the gases in human blood (usually nitrogen and helium) can be easily dissolved at higher amounts during the descent into deep sea. However, when the diver ascends to the normal atmospheric pressure, the gases become insoluble, causing the formation of small bubbles in the blood. This is also known as decompression sickness or the bends. This phenomenon is explained by Henry&#x27;s Law in physical chemistry.

Embolism by other materials is rare. Septic embolism happens when a purulent tissue (pus-containing tissue) is dislodged from its original focus. Tissue embolism is a near-equivalent to cancer metastasis, which happens when cancer tissue infiltrates blood vessels, and small fragments of them are released into the blood stream. Foreign-body embolism happens when exogenous—and only exogenous—materials such as talc enter the blood stream and cause occlusion or obstruction of blood circulation. Bullet embolism occurs in approximately 0.3% cases of gunshot wounds. Amniotic-fluid embolism is a rare complication of childbirth.

== Clinical significance ==
Emboli are clinically significant for their capacity to cause embolisms, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. By themselves, emboli are pathologic and therefore indicate some underlying dysfunction.

It may be difficult in the clinical setting to differentiate a thrombotic event (i.e., a local clot at the site of symptoms) from an embolic event (i.e., local obstruction due to a free-floating mass that traveled through circulation from elsewhere in the body).

Septic emboli may also be a contributor to spreading infection through the bloodstream to other tissues.

== History ==
Rudolf Virchow, the German physician and &quot;father of pathology&quot;, is generally credited with the first explanation of the relationship between thrombi, emboli, and embolisms. He coined the terms embolism (initially called &quot;Embolia&quot;) and thrombosis while proposing a hypothesis for the pathophysiology of pulmonary thromboembolism.

In his work, he described the consequences of thrombosis and the factors leading thereto, a concept which today is known as Virchow&#x27;s Triad. However, there is some dispute regarding certain aspects of this attribution.

<text>Viacom Inc. ( or ; a portmanteau of Video &amp; Audio Communications) was an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate with interests primarily in film and television. It was split from the original Viacom on December 31, 2005 alongside the second CBS Corporation. The controlling shareholder of both companies was National Amusements, a theater company headed by businessman Sumner Redstone. The split was structured so that the original Viacom changed its name to CBS Corporation and spun out its cable and film interests as a new Viacom.

The second Viacom operated Viacom Media Networks, through which it controlled approximately 170 networks and reached approximately 700 million subscribers in approximately 160 countries. Viacom&#x27;s studio assets included Paramount Pictures, MTV Films, and Nickelodeon Animation Studio, as well as a 30% ownership stake in the Rainbow S.p.A. animation studio. CBS Corporation retained the over-the-air broadcasting, television production, pay television subscription service, and publishing assets, which were previously owned by the first Viacom. The second Viacom was the world&#x27;s ninth-largest media company in terms of revenue and headquartered at One Astor Plaza in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.

Viacom would announce its second merger with CBS Corporation on August 13, 2019. The merger was completed on December 4, resulting in the creation of ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global).

==History==
===Early years===

In March 2005, the first Viacom announced plans of exploring the option of splitting the company into two publicly traded companies because of a stagnating stock price and the rivalry between Les Moonves and Tom Freston, longtime heads of CBS and MTV Networks, respectively. Also, the company was facing issues after MTV was banned from producing any more Super Bowl halftime shows after the Super Bowl Halftime Show controversy in 2004.

After the departure of Mel Karmazin in 2004, Sumner Redstone, who served as chairman and chief executive officer, decided to split the offices of president and chief operating officer between Moonves and Freston. Redstone was set to retire in the near future, and a split was seen as a creative solution to the matter of replacing him. It was also intended to provide alternative investments that would be more appealing to investors: one a high cash flow, lower growth company that could afford to pay a substantial dividend and the other a growing company that would have greater investment opportunities and therefore would not be expected to pay a dividend.

The second Viacom was created by Redstone and headed by Freston. It consisted of BET Networks, MTV Networks, and Paramount Pictures. It started trading on January 3, 2006.

===2000s===
In June 2005, Viacom announced its purchase of Neopets, a virtual pet website, along with GameTrailers, GoCityKids, and iFilm. That December, Paramount announced it would acquire DreamWorks Pictures. All indications were that the whole of DreamWorks—both live-comedy film and television studios, albeit not the DreamWorks archive (which was sold to a group led by George Soros in March 2006) nor the animated unit (which was not part of the deal)—would remain owned by Viacom, even though CBS Corporation acquired Paramount&#x27;s television studio.

In February 2006, Paramount completed the acquisition of DreamWorks. On April 24, Viacom obtained Xfire. In August, Viacom announced that it had acquired Atom Entertainment for $200 million. In September, Viacom acquired game developer Harmonix for $175 million.

In February 2007, Viacom ordered leaked copyrighted video clips be taken off the video-sharing service YouTube for copyright reasons. On February 21, Viacom publicly announced they would be offering free online access to their material through Silicon Valley&#x27;s distributor Joost.

On May 21, 2007, Viacom entered into a 50–50 joint venture with Indian media company Network 18 to form Viacom 18 which would house Viacom&#x27;s existing channels in India: MTV, VH1 and Nickelodeon as well as Network 18&#x27;s Bollywood movie business. All future Viacom content for India and new ventures such as a Hindi entertainment channel and a Hindi movie channel would be housed in this joint venture.

On December 19, 2007, Viacom signed a five-year, $500 million contract with Microsoft that included content sharing and advertisement. The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on Xbox Live and MSN. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and Windows. On the advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft&#x27;s Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned websites. Also, Microsoft purchased a large amount of advertising on Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks. Finally, Microsoft would also collaborate on promotions and sponsorships for MTV and BET award shows, two Viacom-owned cable networks.

On December 4, 2008, Viacom announced layoffs of 850 personnel, or 7% of their workforce. At the end of the year, Time Warner Cable (along with partner Bright House Networks) and Viacom&#x27;s MTV Networks could not come to terms for the renewal of any Viacom channel beyond the end of year. Time Warner Cable&#x27;s operations include New York City and Los Angeles, with Bright House including the Tampa Bay and Orlando markets, both top-20 markets. This blackout was narrowly avoided when a zero-hour deal was reached shortly after midnight on January 1, 2009.

On December 7, 2009, Viacom sold its stake in MTV Brasil to Grupo Abril along with rights to the brand. Details on the deal were not disclosed.

===2010s===
In February 2011, Hulu and Viacom announced the return of &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; and &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to Hulu, along with shows from the Viacom library. Nickelodeon&#x27;s shows are not part of this deal. Also that month, Viacom became a co-owner of Rainbow S.p.A., an Italian television studio best known for the &quot;Winx Club&quot; franchise. Since the purchase, Viacom&#x27;s Nickelodeon networks have broadcast Rainbow&#x27;s shows worldwide. Nickelodeon&#x27;s American studios have also collaborated with Rainbow on multiple productions, including &quot;Winx Club&quot; and &quot;Club 57&quot;.

Later, in October 2011, Viacom purchased a majority stake in Bellator Fighting Championships. Spike TV started to air Bellator in 2013, after the rights to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) library ended in 2012.

On December 1, 2011, the company stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and began listing its securities on Nasdaq instead. The stock ticker symbols are the same as that used while the company was on the NYSE.

On July 10, 2012, during contract negotiations over raising carrier rates the U.S. satellite TV provider, DirecTV&#x27;s executives approached Viacom with a new proposal and a request to continue broadcasting 17 of Viacom&#x27;s television networks (including Nickelodeon, MTV, Logo, and Comedy Central) during talks, but received no response and thus Viacom ceased transmission to DirecTV&#x27;s 20 million subscribers. On July 11, in a counter response to DirecTV advising its subscribers to view original programming from the affected networks online, Viacom scaled back access to recent episodes of Viacom-owned program content available to the websites of its networks. Viacom described this as a &quot;temporary slimdown&quot; until a new carriage deal with DirecTV was reached. Viacom and DirecTV reached an agreement on July 20 to return the interrupted programming.
In 2012 CEO Phillip Dauman began to report Viacom&#x27;s intentions to bundle past programming and make it available on-demand via services like Hulu.

On January 22, 2014, Viacom established a marketing division, Viacom Velocity.

On April 1, 2014, Cable One removed 15 channels owned by Viacom (MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, and TV Land) off after the two companies failed to reach an agreement. Channels were replaced with other networks, including BBC America, Sprout, Sundance TV, IFC, Investigation Discovery, TV One, CMP/TV, National Geographic Channel, and TheBlaze. The change has been deemed permanent.

On May 1, 2014, Viacom announced it had agreed to take over the British broadcaster Channel 5 from Northern &amp; Shell, the media group owned by the British newspaper publisher Richard Desmond. Viacom becomes the first American media company to take over a British broadcaster with a public service remit. The purchase of Channel 5 closed on September 10, 2014.

On October 1, 2014, Suddenlink Communications, removed channels owned by Viacom off after the two companies failed to reach an agreement. Channels were replaced with other networks including Sprout, FXX, Pivot, Uplifting Entertainment, Investigation Discovery, Oprah Winfrey Network, Women&#x27;s Entertainment, and TheBlaze.

On August 20, 2016, a settlement between Sumner and Shari Redstone and Philippe Dauman was reached that would have him resign as chief executive officer and be replaced with Thomas E. Dooley as interim CEO. Dauman would continue to serve as chairman until September 13. On May 25, 2017, Viacom channels returned to Suddenlink after nearly 3 years of absence.

In November 2016, Viacom bought Argentine television network Telefe. In December 2016, the Viacom board appointed Bob Bakish as acting CEO. His appointment as president and CEO was made permanent on December 12, 2016.

In November 2017, Viacom announced the opening of a new digital content division named Viacom Digital Studios. The company has hired former AwesomenessTV chief business officer Kelly Day to lead the studio. Day began her duties on November 20. In February 2018, Viacom announced their plans to acquire the internet video conference VidCon in an effort to reach out to youth audiences (in a similar way to Viacom&#x27;s Nickelodeon and MTV channels).

In the same month, Viacom announced that they would launch an official Viacom streaming service in fall 2018, in another effort by Bakish to revitalize the company. This streaming service would support ads (similar to Hulu) and was expected to include television series from Viacom Media Networks that have not been available on other services, such as Hulu or Amazon Prime Video. Bakish has stated that the streaming service would serve as a &quot;complement&quot; to OTT MVPDs, rather than a replacement.

In April 2018, Viacom hosted its first presentation at the annual Digital Content NewFronts, where they announced new original content for sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat. They also announced the expansion of VidCon to London in 2019 at the same conference.

On July 25, 2018, Viacom announced that it was in talks to acquire AwesomenessTV for a fraction of the company&#x27;s $650 million valuation in 2016. Two days later on July 27, Viacom officially acquired the company for $25 million. Jordan Levin would leave his position as CEO of AwesomenessTV following the acquisition. In January 2019, it was announced that Viacom has acquired Internet television streaming service, Pluto TV for $340 million.

====Re-merger deal with CBS====

On September 29, 2016, National Amusements sent a letter to Viacom and CBS Corporation, encouraging the two companies to merge back into one company. On December 12, the deal was called off.

On January 12, 2018, CNBC reported that Viacom had re-entered talks to merge back into CBS Corporation after the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger was planned, as well as Disney&#x27;s proposed acquisition of most 21st Century Fox assets and heavy competition from companies such as Netflix and Amazon. Shortly afterward, it was reported that the combined company could be a suitor for acquiring the film studio Lionsgate. Viacom and Lionsgate were both interested in acquiring The Weinstein Company (TWC) in the wake of sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Viacom was listed as one of 22 potential buyers that were interested in acquiring TWC. They lost the bid, and on March 1, 2018, it was announced that Maria Contreras-Sweet would acquire all of TWC&#x27;s assets for $500 million.

On March 30, 2018, CBS made an all-stock offer slightly below Viacom&#x27;s market value and insisted that its existing leadership, including long-time chairman and CEO Les Moonves, oversee the re-combined company. Viacom rejected the offer as being too low, requesting an increase of $2.8 billion, and requesting that Bob Bakish be maintained as president and COO under Moonves. It was reported that these conflicts had resulted from Shari Redstone seeking more control over CBS and its leadership.

Eventually, on May 14, 2018, CBS Corporation sued its and Viacom&#x27;s parent company National Amusements and accused Redstone of abusing her voting power in the company and forcing a merger that was not supported by CBS or Viacom. CBS also accused Redstone of discouraging Verizon Communications from acquiring it, which could have been beneficial to its shareholders.

On May 23, 2018, Les Moonves explained that he considered the Viacom channels to be an &quot;albatross,&quot; and while he favored more content for CBS All Access (now Paramount+), he believed that there were better deals for CBS than the Viacom deal, such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Lionsgate or Sony Pictures. Moonves also considered Bakish a threat because he did not want an ally of Redstone as a board member of the combined company.

On September 9, 2018, Moonves left CBS after being accused by twelve women of sexual assault. National Amusements agreed to not propose a CBS-Viacom merger for at least two years after the date of the settlement.

On May 30, 2019, CNBC reported that CBS and Viacom would explore merger discussions in mid-June 2019. CBS&#x27;s board of directors was revamped with people who were open to a merger. The re-merger was made possible with the resignation of Moonves (who opposed all attempts for a Viacom merger). The talks had started following rumors of CBS acquiring Starz from Lionsgate. Reports say that CBS and Viacom reportedly set August 8 as an informal deadline for reaching an agreement to recombine the two media companies. CBS announced to acquire Viacom as part of the re-merger deal for up to $15.4 billion.

On August 2, 2019, it was reported that CBS and Viacom agreed to merge back into one entity. Both companies came to an agreement on the management team for its merger with Bakish serving as CEO of the combined company and president and acting CEO of CBS, as Joseph Ianniello oversees the CBS-branded assets. However, on August 7, 2019, both CBS and Viacom delayed their merger announcement as the two companies reported the quarterly earnings, though the talks about the re-merger continued.

On August 13, 2019, CBS and Viacom officially announced their merger; CBS would purchase Viacom and change its name to ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global). Bakish would become president and CEO of ViacomCBS with Ianniello serving as chairman and CEO of CBS, where he would oversee the CBS-branded assets. Shari Redstone would also serve as chairwoman of the new company. On October 29, 2019, National Amusements approved the re-merger deal and expected to close the deal in early December with the recombined company trading its shares on Nasdaq under the symbols &quot;VIAC&quot; and &quot;VIACA&quot;. On December 4, the deal was completed.

==Copyright complaints against YouTube==

In February 2007, Viacom sent upwards of 100,000 Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices to the video-sharing site YouTube. Of the 100,000 notices, approximately 60–70 non-infringing videos were removed under the auspices of copyright infringement.

On March 13, 2007, Viacom filed a US$1 billion legal claim (&quot;Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.&quot;) against Google and YouTube alleging massive copyright infringement, alleging that users frequently uploaded copyrighted material to YouTube—enough to cause a hit in revenue for Viacom and a gain in advertisement revenue for YouTube. The complaint contended that almost 160,000 unauthorized clips of Viacom&#x27;s programming were made available on YouTube and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than 1.5 billion times.

In July 2008, the case generated controversy when District Judge Louis Stanton ruled that YouTube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site. Judge Stanton rejected Viacom&#x27;s request for YouTube to hand over the source code of its search engine system, saying that the code was a trade secret.
Google and Viacom later agreed to allow Google to anonymize all the data before handing it over to Viacom.

On June 23, 2010, Judge Stanton ruled in Google&#x27;s favor in a motion for summary judgment, holding that Google was protected by provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement. Viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling.

On April 5, 2012, the ruling was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Writing for a two-judge panel (because Judge Roger Miner had died while the trial was pending) of the Second Circuit, Judge José A. Cabranes concluded that &quot;a reasonable jury could find that YouTube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website&quot;. Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law, expressed concern that the ruling would negatively affect startups, by making them &quot;more hair-trigger on taking down news or content, for fear that failure to do so will be held against them by content providers&quot;.

On April 18, 2013, Judge Stanton issued another order granting summary judgment in favor of YouTube. An appeal was begun, but the week before the parties were to appear in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a settlement was announced, and it was reported that no money changed hands.
Viacom and its alternative name B_Viacom have since taken to removing videos or blocked countries themselves.

==Corporate governance==
The previous board of directors of Viacom were George S. Abrams, David Andelman, Joseph Califano, Jr., William Cohen, Philippe Dauman, Alan C. Greenberg, Charles Phillips, Shari Redstone, Sumner Redstone (deceased), Frederic Salerno, William Schwartz, and Robert D. Walter.

Following the Viacom/CBS split, the Viacom board consisted of George S. Abrams, Philippe Dauman, Thomas E. Dooley, Ellen V. Futter, Robert Kraft, Alan Greenberg, Charles Phillips, Sumner Redstone (chairman), Shari Redstone (non-executive vice-chair), Frederic Salerno, and William Schwartz. As of 2010, the Board consisted of George Abrams, Philippe Dauman, Thomas E. Dooley, Alan Greenberg, Robert Kraft, Blythe McGarvie, Bob Bakish, Charles Phillips, Shari E. Redstone, Sumner Redstone, Frederic Salerno, and William Schwartz.

<text>Sumner Murray Redstone ( Rothstein; May 27, 1923 – August 11, 2020) was an American billionaire businessman and media magnate. He was the founder and chairman of the second incarnation of Viacom, chairman of CBS Corporation (both companies merged in 2019, a year before Redstone&#x27;s death), and the majority owner and chairman of the National Amusements theater chain. 

Until his death, Redstone was a majority voting shareholder of the media conglomerate ViacomCBS, the parent company of the Paramount Pictures film studio, the CBS television network, and various cable networks. 

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, as of April 2020, he was worth US$2.6 billion.

Redstone was formerly the executive chairman of both CBS and Viacom. In February 2016, at age 92, Redstone resigned both chairmanships following a court-ordered examination by a geriatric psychiatrist. He was ultimately succeeded by Les Moonves at CBS and Philippe Dauman at Viacom.

==Early life and education==
Redstone was born Sumner Murray Rothstein in 1923 in Boston to Belle (née Ostrovsky) and Michael Rothstein. Sumner was a second-generation Bostonian; his father Michael was born in Boston in 1902 to Galician Jewish parents originally from Kozova, a shtetl in Austro-Hungarian land now in Ukraine. His mother Bella was also an American-born child of Jewish immigrants; her parents emigrated to the U.S. from Kyiv early in the 20th century.

In 1940, at Sumner&#x27;s behest, his father changed the family surname from &quot;Rothstein&quot; to &quot;Redstone&quot;; although Sumner credited his father for the name change, friends of the family attribute it more to Sumner. &quot;Red stone&quot; is the translation of the Yiddish name Rothstein. Michael Rothstein owned Northeast Theater Corporation in Dedham, Massachusetts, the forerunner of National Amusements, and the Boston branch of the Latin Quarter Nightclub. As a teenager, Sumner had summer jobs at his father&#x27;s theaters but &quot;had higher aspirations than the then-still-somewhat-déclassé world of theaters,&quot; wrote Keach Hagey.

Redstone attended the Boston Latin School, from which he graduated in 1940 first in his class, and was accepted to Harvard College on scholarship. Among his coursework at Harvard was a Japanese course taught by Professor Edwin O. Reischauer, recommended to him by college administrators based on his study of Latin and Greek in high school. In 1943, Reischauer left Harvard to establish a United States Army Signal Corps training program at Arlington Hall for Japanese translators and cryptanalysts, positions in need during World War II; Redstone would be among Reischauer&#x27;s students following the professor to Arlington Hall. 

Enlisting in the United States Army, Redstone became a second lieutenant in 1944 before being promoted to first lieutenant. He worked with a team at the Signals Intelligence Service that decoded Japanese messages. Despite leaving Harvard for the military, Redstone had completed enough credits that Harvard granted his Bachelor of Arts in the class of 1944 with a concentration in classics and government. After his military service, he attended Georgetown University Law Center before transferring to Harvard Law School and receiving his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1947.

==Career==
===Legal career===
After completing law school, Redstone moved to San Francisco to become a clerk with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a job that then paid $43 per week. While employed by the Ninth Circuit, Redstone also taught labor law courses in the evenings at University of San Francisco School of Law. Beginning in 1948, Redstone joined the United States Department of Justice Tax Division as a staff attorney with the appellate tax division, in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court case &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; when the government was actively combating anti-competitive practices among Paramount Pictures and other major film studios.

After two years with the Justice Department, Redstone followed his supervisors to private practice in 1950. Then in 1951, Redstone became a partner of the firm Ford, Bergson, Adams, Borkland, &amp; Redstone with two of his former Justice Department supervisors Herbert Bergson and Herbert Borkland, along with former Deputy Attorney General Peyton Ford. In the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Holland v. United States&quot;, Redstone represented the plaintiffs, a married couple of hotel owners convicted of tax evasion following a sudden rise in their net worth. Although the court would uphold their conviction, Redstone&#x27;s argument that the government had the burden of proof in proving tax evasion in unusual increases in net worth would later become Internal Revenue Service policy.

===Northeast Theatre Corporation (later National Amusements)===
In 1954, he joined his father&#x27;s theater chain Northeast Theatre Corporation, which then had fourteen drive-in theaters in five eastern states. The Redstone family re-incorporated Northeast Theatre Corporation and their other businesses as National Amusements in 1959 to access more money to finance expansion; Redstone would invest nearly $18,000 in stock and be named vice president. In 1964, Redstone was elected president of the Theater Owners of America, which would merge with a rival group to form the National Association of Theatre Owners, for which Redstone became chairman in 1965.

Redstone became CEO of National Amusements in 1967. The company had 93 theater screens (52 drive-ins and 41 indoor) when Redstone took office; within 10 years, National Amusements had nearly 250 screens. After watching the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film in 1977, Redstone directed National Amusements to buy a five percent stake in 20th Century Fox, distributor of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Having bought Fox for $8 a share, National Amusements sold Fox at $60 after Marvin Davis bought the company. National Amusements&#x27; other investments in Columbia Pictures, Orion Pictures, and Paramount Pictures also had large returns on investment in the early 1980s.

===Viacom===
As a hedge against slow growth in movie theaters, Redstone began buying stock in Viacom International in 1985. Viacom spun off from CBS in 1971 after the FCC ruled at the time that television networks could not syndicate their own programs. Viacom initially syndicated CBS network shows such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, and &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

Viacom also owned MTV Networks (formerly known as Warner-AMEX Satellite Entertainment), which owned MTV and Nickelodeon. In addition, other properties included pay television networks Showtime and The Movie Channel. Viacom acquired MTV Networks in 1985 for $550 million from Steve Ross&#x27; Warner Communications. 

After a four-month hostile takeover, Redstone won voting control of Viacom for $3.4 billion on March 4, 1987.

=== Paramount Pictures ===
Redstone&#x27;s next acquisition was Paramount Communications (previously Gulf+Western), parent of Paramount Pictures, in 1994. Engaging in a bidding war with QVC president Barry Diller and TCI president John Malone, Redstone had to raise his bid at least three times from $7.5 billion to $10.1 billion. Some analysts at the time estimated that Redstone overpaid by billions, and Viacom would accrue nearly $10 billion in debt after acquiring Paramount. However, the sale of certain assets such as Madison Square Garden to Cablevision and Simon &amp; Schuster for $4.6 billion to Pearson PLC would eventually help Viacom improve financially, with its stock price in 1998 approaching $60, breaking its 1995 record high. Under Redstone&#x27;s leadership, Paramount produced such popular, award-winning films as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Redstone replaced the team of Jonathan Dolgen and Sherry Lansing in 2004. After arriving at Paramount in 2005, chairman and chief executive officer Brad Grey led a return to fortune at the box office. He oversaw the creation or revitalization of several major franchises, including &quot;Transformers&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Paranormal Activity&quot;. Paramount also forged productive relationships with top-tier filmmakers and talent including J. J. Abrams, Michael Bay and Martin Scorsese. The 2010 Paramount slate achieved much success with &quot;Shutter Island&quot; and a &quot;True Grit&quot; remake, reaching the biggest box office totals in the storied careers of Martin Scorsese and the Coen Brothers, respectively. In addition, during Grey&#x27;s tenure, Paramount launched its own worldwide releasing arm, Paramount Pictures International, and has released acclaimed films such as &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, &quot;Up in the Air&quot;, and &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;.

He also purchased Blockbuster Entertainment, which included Aaron Spelling&#x27;s production company and a huge library of films, much of which has been merged into Paramount Pictures. Blockbuster has now been spun off into its independent entity. Redstone acquired CBS Corporation in 2000 and then spun it off as a separate company in 2005, taking with it all of Paramount&#x27;s television shows and catalog.

In December 2005, Paramount agreed to buy DreamWorks SKG for an estimated $1.6 billion. The acquisition was completed on February 1, 2006. Subsequent financing brought Viacom&#x27;s investment down to $700 million. The animation studio, DreamWorks Animation, was not included in the deal as it has been its own company since late 2004. However, Paramount had the rights to distribute films by DreamWorks Animation until 2013.

On June 1, 2012, Paramount Pictures renamed the Administration Building on the studio lot the Sumner Redstone Building in a dedication ceremony attended by employees of Paramount Pictures and Viacom.

===CBS===
One of Redstone&#x27;s largest acquisitions came in the form of Viacom&#x27;s former parent, CBS. After the FCC modified regulations in 1999 to allow companies to own two television stations in the same media market, CBS president and former Viacom President and COO Mel Karmazin proposed a merger with Redstone. On September 7, 1999, Redstone and Karmazin announced that Viacom would buy CBS for $37.3 billion, at the time the biggest media merger of the twentieth century; the newly merged Viacom/CBS would become the second largest media company behind Time Warner. Viacom had a wide range of assets such as the CBS and UPN broadcast networks; cable television networks including MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and BET; the pay television network Showtime, radio (Infinity Broadcasting, which produced the Howard Stern radio shows), Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television, and King World Productions.

After CBS and Viacom split in 2005, Redstone remained chairman of both companies, but two separate CEOs were appointed for each company, Les Moonves for CBS and Tom Freston for Viacom.

In 2007, former &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor Dan Rather sued CBS and other parties such as Redstone in New York state court for breach of contract after CBS declined to renew his contract following a controversy over a story by Rather on &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; about then-President George W. Bush&#x27;s military service. The New York Court of Appeals dismissed the case in 2009.

===Succession===
Redstone&#x27;s trusts made it clear that his daughter, Shari Redstone (vice-chairwoman of the board of Viacom and CBS as well as president of National Amusements), was set to assume his role upon his death. However, a November 22, 2006, &quot;New York Times&quot; article indicated that Redstone was reconsidering his daughter&#x27;s role. In 2007, they feuded publicly over issues of corporate governance and the future of the cinema chain.

Documents were made public which verify that, as part of a settlement from Sumner Redstone&#x27;s first divorce, all of his stock was in irrevocable trusts that was to be left for his grandchildren. On March 1, 2010, Redstone publicly confirmed that all of his stock would be left for his five grandchildren (Brandon Korff, Kimberlee Korff, Tyler Korff, Keryn Redstone, and Lauren Redstone).

Redstone made arrangements to step down as CEO of Viacom in 2006. After Mel Karmazin resigned in 2004, two heirs apparent were named: Co-President and Co-COO Les Moonves (who was number 2 to Karmazin at CBS; he was the former head of Warner Bros. Television and before that, Lorimar Television) and Co-President and Co-COO Tom Freston (who had been president and CEO of MTV Networks since 1987 and had been with the company since the formation of MTV Networks&#x27; precursor company, Warner-AMEX Satellite Entertainment). After the Viacom split was approved by the board on June 14, 2005, Moonves headed CBS Corporation, and Freston headed the second incarnation of Viacom.

On September 5, 2006, Redstone removed Freston as president and CEO of Viacom and replaced him with director and former Viacom counsel Philippe Dauman. Redstone also brought back former CFO Tom Dooley. This was surprising to many, as Freston had been seen by many as Redstone&#x27;s heir apparent, and Redstone had touted that Freston would run the company after he retired. Redstone publicly stated that he let Freston go because of Viacom&#x27;s lack of aggressiveness in the digital/online arena, lack of contact with investors, and a lackluster upfront (coupled with falling viewership) at MTV Networks.

In February 2016, at age 92, after a court-ordered examination by a geriatric psychiatrist whose findings were not publicly disclosed, Redstone relinquished the chairmanship of CBS to Moonves and the chairmanship of Viacom to Dauman. In May 2016, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Cowan dismissed a lawsuit alleging that Redstone was mentally incompetent. The judge stated it was &quot;not in dispute that Redstone suffers from either mild or moderate dementia.&quot; In addition, his speech was severely impaired due to a bout with aspiration pneumonia in 2014. Two weeks later, another such lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts.

===Holdings===
At the time of his death, Redstone owned over seventy percent of the voting interest of ViacomCBS. ViacomCBS was controlled by Redstone through National Amusements. Redstone sold his holdings of Midway Games, of over 89 percent, in December 2008.

==Books==
Redstone&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Passion to Win&quot; (co-written with author Peter Knobler), was published in 2001 by Viacom&#x27;s Simon &amp; Schuster. This book details Redstone&#x27;s life from a young boy in Boston to the difficult takeover of Viacom and the problems he overcame in purchasing and managing both Blockbuster Video and Paramount Pictures. The book also recounts the CBS merger (Viacom was a spin-off company of CBS to syndicate its programs, and the subsidiary bought the parent almost 30 years later). Succession creator Jesse Armstrong has stated that Redstone&#x27;s biography A Passion to Win was an influence in creating the series.

Viacom&#x27;s broadcasting properties at the time of &quot;A Passion to Win&quot;″s release included several radio stations and two TV stations: WBZ CBS 4, which had just become a CBS O&amp;O through a merger with Westinghouse four years before Viacom and CBS merged, and WSBK UPN 38 in Redstone&#x27;s hometown, Boston.

In 2023 the book &quot;Unscripted: The Epic Battle for a Hollywood Media Empire&quot; was published in Cornerstone Press (Penguin Books), written by James B. Stewart and Rachel Abrams. The book tells the story of the Redstone dynasty.

==Political views==
A longtime Democratic supporter, with a history of donating to many Democratic campaigns, including regular donations to Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, and former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Redstone endorsed Republican George W. Bush over Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election, allegedly because he argued that Bush would be better for his company and the economy. Despite this public endorsement, he donated money to Kerry during the primaries.

==Philanthropy==
Redstone contributed over $150 million to various philanthropic causes.
* In April 2007, Redstone announced a commitment of $105 million in charitable grants to fund research and patient care advancements in cancer and burn recovery at three major non-profit healthcare organizations. The cash contributions of $35 million were each paid out over five years to FasterCures/The Center for Accelerating Medical Solutions, based in Washington, D.C.; the Cedars-Sinai Prostate Cancer Center in Los Angeles, California; and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.
* Up to at least 2012, Redstone contributed $1.5 million to the Global Poverty Project.
* He gave millions of dollars to the Cambodian Children&#x27;s Fund, a nonprofit program that provides a wide range of critical health and educational services to impoverished and abused children in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Redstone&#x27;s contribution will be used to create the Sumner M. Redstone Child Rescue Center, a stand-alone facility originally scheduled to open during the fall of 2007 for children 5 to 16. In subsequent years Redstone continued to support this organization.
* In early 2010, Redstone pledged a $1 million gift to Autism Speaks in support of scientific research into the causes of autism and effective treatments. Redstone had given financial support to Autism Speaks previously. In 2011, Redstone gave an additional $500,000 to the group in support of its Translational Research Initiative, bringing his cumulative lifetime contribution to Autism Speaks to $1.7 million.
* In July 2010, Redstone donated $24 million to the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California to support cancer research.
* In September 2012, Redstone donated $18 million to the Boston University School of Law. The gift funded, in part, the construction of the five-story Sumner M. Redstone Building, a classroom building that opened in 2014.

==Personal life==
Redstone married Phyllis Gloria Raphael on July 4, 1947. They had two children: Brent Redstone and Shari Redstone. In 1999, they divorced when Phyllis Raphael served Sumner Redstone a 3 billion dollar divorce lawsuit which accused the mogul of adultery and cruelty. Sumner was seen with Hollywood producer Christine Peters in Paris and was quoted as saying at the time that he &quot;wanted to spend the rest of his life with Christine.&quot; As a result of the divorce, Redstone moved to Los Angeles where he continued to romantically pursue Peters. Peters went on to produce the hit romantic comedy &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; in Canada. As Redstone&#x27;s patience ran out, he married Paula Fortunato, a former primary school teacher 39 years his junior. Redstone filed for divorce from Fortunato on October 17, 2008. Their divorce was finalized on January 22, 2009. Redstone owned a house in the Beverly Park area of Los Angeles, which he purchased in 2002 for $14.5 million.

On March 29, 1979, he suffered severe burns in a fire at the Copley Plaza hotel, in Boston, but survived after 30 hours of extensive surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital. Though he was warned that he might never be able to live a normal life again, eight years later he was fit enough to insist on playing tennis nearly every day and to launch a hostile takeover of Viacom. Redstone discussed the story of surviving the fire as a reflection of his strong determination and will to live.

In July 2010, Redstone was caught on tape trying to find the source of an embarrassing leak within MTV. Redstone offered money and protection to a journalist if he would give up his source. Redstone had been pushing MTV management to give more airtime to the band the Electric Barbarellas. In the message, Redstone tells the reporter that &quot;we&#x27;re not going to kill&quot; the source, adding &quot;We just want to talk to him&quot;. The 87-year-old Redstone also told the reporter he would be &quot;well rewarded and well protected&quot; if he would reveal the source. Peter Lauria told NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show he would not do it. Viacom Inc. spokesman, Carl Folta confirmed to &quot;Today&quot; that it was Redstone&#x27;s voice on the message and said he had made a mistake. A Viacom source told the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;Sumner wants to be consequential. Sumner is really proud of what he did. This guy is loving it… He likes people to know he&#x27;s still alive&quot;.

In August 2015, Redstone split with his live-in girlfriend, Sydney Holland, after five years together.

In January 2019, Redstone and his family settled with his former live-in companion Manuela Herzer. According to MarketWatch, &quot;Herzer agreed to pay back $3.25 million of the tens of millions of gifts that Redstone gave her&quot;, and &quot;the wide-ranging agreement ends all litigation between the two sides, who have been battling in the courts since the fall of 2015 when Redstone kicked Herzer out of his Beverly Hills mansion, replaced her as his health-care agent and wrote her out of his estate planning.&quot;

On August 11, 2020, Redstone died at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 97. The cause of death is unknown.

The film &quot;&quot; is in memory of Redstone.

<doc id="183054" wikidata="Q15229353" url="?curid=183054" title="Divisions of the world in Islam">
<text>In classical Islamic law, there are three major divisions of the world which are &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; (), denoting regions where Islamic law prevails, &quot;dar al-sulh&quot; (lit. territory of treaty) denoting non-Islamic lands which are at peace or have an armistice with a Muslim government, and &quot;dar al-harb&quot; (lit. territory of war), denoting lands that share a border with &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; and have not concluded an armistice. Muslims regard Islam as a universal religion and believe it to be the rightful law for all humankind. Muslims are imposed to spread Sharia law and sovereignty through lesser jihad against &quot;dar al-harb&quot;. According to Islam, this should first be attempted peacefully through Dawah. In the case of war, Muslims are imposed to subject, or eliminate fighters until they surrender or seek peace.

The Arabic singular form &quot;dar&quot; (), translated literally, may mean &quot;house&quot;, &quot;abode&quot;, &quot;structure&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, &quot;land&quot;, or &quot;country&quot;. In Islamic jurisprudence it often refers to a part of the world. The notions of &quot;houses&quot; or &quot;divisions&quot; of the world in Islam such as &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; and &quot;dar al-harb&quot; does not appear in the Quran or the hadith. According to Abou El Fadl, the only &quot;dar&quot;s the Quran speaks of are &quot;the abode of the Hereafter and the abode of the earthly life, with the former described as clearly superior to the latter&quot;.

Early Islamic jurists devised these terms to denote legal rulings for ongoing Muslim conquests almost a century after Muhammad. The first use of the terms was in Iraq by Abu Hanifa and his disciples Abu Yusuf and Al-Shaybani. Among those in the Levant, Al-Awza&#x27;i was leading in this discipline and later Al-Shafi&#x27;i.

The concept of &quot;dar al-harb&quot; has been affected by historical changes such as the political fragmentation of the Muslim world. The theoretical distinction between &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; and &quot;dar al-harb&quot; is widely considered inapplicable, and many contemporary Islamic jurists regard the Western world as part of the former, since Muslims can freely practise and proselytize their faith in Western countries. The Qur’an directs Muslims to spread the message of Islam worldwide declaring it to be a religion for all humankind.

==Early Islamic religious divisions==

Early Islamic legal theory divided the world into two divisions: &quot;abode of Islam&quot; and &quot;abode of war&quot;. The first, called &quot;dar al-Islam&quot;, sometimes &quot;Pax Islamica&quot;, consisted of Muslims and non-Muslims living under Islamic sovereignty. The second was &quot;dar al-harb&quot;, ruled by non-Muslims and specifically infidels. Another secondary division of &quot;Dar al-&#x27;Ahd&quot; was assigned for territories ruled by non-Muslims that have a treaty of non-aggression or peace with Muslims, effectively an intermediate status between the two major divisions.

===&quot;Dar al-Islam&quot;===
Dar al-Islam ( ; or dar at-Tawhid ) was a term used by Ulama (Muslim legal scholars) to refer to those countries under Muslim sovereignty, sometimes considered &quot;the home of Islam&quot; or &quot;Pax Islamica&quot;. &quot;Dar al-Islam&quot; meaning &quot;house/abode of Islam&quot; is also referred to as &quot;dar al-salam&quot; or &quot;house/abode of peace&quot;. In the Quran (10.25 and 6.127) this term refers to Paradise in Heaven.

Dar al-Islam consisted of Muslims and non-Muslims, with the latter living as &quot;dhimmis&quot; (protected persons). The non-Muslims had the right to their own law and religion in exchange for paying the jizya. While Muslims enjoyed full civil rights, non-Muslims were given partial civil rights. However, both Muslims and non-Muslims were equal in their claim to security and being protected from attack. For example, if an enemy seized dar al-Islam&#x27;s citizens, the state was obliged to free them, whether they were Muslim or non-Muslim.

Likewise, in foreign affairs, the Muslim government represented both its Muslim and non-Muslim citizens. Relations between Muslims and non-Muslims were regulated by &quot;constitutional charters&quot; (special agreements issued by the authorities), and these agreements recognized the personal law of each non-Muslim community (the Jewish community, Christian community etc). Non-Muslims could access Islamic courts if they wished.

According to Abu Hanifa, considered to be the originator of the concept, the requirements for a country to be part of &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; are:
# Muslims must be able to enjoy peace and security with and within this country.
# The country should be ruled by a Muslim government.
# It has common frontiers with some Muslim countries.

===Dar al-&#x27;Ahd===
Dar al-&#x27;Ahd ( &quot;house of truce&quot;) or dar al-Sulh ( &quot;house of conciliation/treaty&quot;) were terms used for territories that have a treaty of non-aggression or peace with Muslims. Such a division was recognized by Shafi&#x27;i jurists. But Hanafi jurists argued that if a territory concluded a peace treaty with dar al-Islam, dar al-Islam was obligated to protect this territory and its people, hence the territory effectively became dar al-Islam. Thus, Hanafis did not recognize this division.

This designation can be found in the Quran, where Muslims are directed on how they should act in war:

===Dar al-harb===
Dar al-harb ( &quot;house of war&quot;) was a term classically referring to those countries which do not have a treaty of non-aggression or peace with Muslims (those that do are called dar al-&#x27;Ahd or dar al-Sulh). The notions of divisions of the world, or &quot;dar al-harb&quot;, does not appear in the Quran or the Hadith. According to some scholars, the term &quot;abode of war&quot; was simply a description of the harsh reality of the premodern world.

According to Majid Khadduri, the fundamental distinction between &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; and &quot;dar al-harb&quot; was introduced after the defeat of the Umayyad Caliphate at the Battle of Tours in 732 which prevented the expansion of Islam to the north, while at the same time the expansion of the caliphate to the east had been halted. Wahbah al-Zuhayli argues that the concept of dar al-harb is mostly historical: &quot;The existence of Dār al-Islām and Dār al-Ḥarb in contemporary times is rare or extremely limited. This is because Islamic countries have joined the United Nations covenant that stipulates that the relationship between nations is peace and not war. Therefore non-Muslim countries are Dār al-‘Ahd ...&quot;

According to Abu Hanifa there are three conditions that need to be fulfilled for a land to be classified as dar al-harb:

# Implementation of the laws of the non-Muslims openly and that no rule of Islam is implemented any longer
# Bordering another dar al-harb 
# No Muslim remains safe as he was before the non-Muslims took power.

The purpose behind differentiating between dar al-Islam and dar al-harb was to identify the land as either one of safety for the Muslims or of fear. So, if Muslims are generally safe in a land and not in fear, then it cannot be classified as dar al-harb.

During European colonization, the status of colonized territories such as British India was debated, with some saying that it was &quot;dar al-harb&quot;. However, there was no suggestion that Muslims were therefore required to wage jihad against the colonizers.

Under the classical doctrine, it was the duty of Muslim rulers to bring dar al-harb under Islamic sovereignty. A state of war was presumed between dar al-harb and dar al-Islam, but this did not necessarily imply that hostilities must occur. It was up to the ruler to decide when, where and against whom to wage war. So in practice there was often peace between dar al-Islam and dar al-harb; formal armistices could last up to 10 years, while informal peace could last much longer than 10 years.

Since &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; was considered to be in a state of constant warfare with dar-al-harb unless there was a formal peace treaty, and non-Muslim prisoners of war viewed as a legitimate target of enslavement according to the rules of slavery in Islam, the &quot;dar al-harb&quot; was historically used as a slave supply source for the slave trade during the era of era of slavery in the muslim world. 

During periods of a formal peace treaty with a territory in dar al-harb, it was immune from attack by Muslims, and its inhabitants (called &quot;harbi&quot;) could enter Muslim lands unmolested. In the absence of a peace treaty, a &quot;harbi&quot; could also enter Muslim lands safely if that &quot;&#x27;harbi&quot; first obtained an &quot;aman&quot; (assurance of protection). It was through such &quot;aman&quot; that trade and cultural exchange was conducted between dar al-harb and dar al-Islam. Any adult Muslim resident of dar al-Islam (male or female, free or slave) could grant such &quot;aman&quot; to a &quot;harbi&quot;. Al-Shaybani ruled that even non-Muslim residents (dhimmis) could grant aman, while others sources say non-Muslim residents could not grant aman.

==Modern division application==
There is a controversy among the Islamic view points regarding the application of the early territorial Islamic concepts to the modern world. While many Islamic scholars adhere the view point that the early Islamic divisions are no longer relevant to the modern world, other argue that it could still be applied for some specific situations and territories and radical viewpoints do stick to the fundamental interpretation.

According to Muhammad Haniff Hassan, it can be argued that most of the secular Muslim countries today are not Dar al-Islam and most of the non-Muslim countries (which are not at war with the Muslim world) are not Dar al-Harb. Such nuances weigh against the idea of Muslims at perpetual war with the non-Muslims in the modern world, with the contemporary international system has evolved so much from the period when the classical Muslim scholars wrote on the classification that new thinking and perspectives are required. Further, according to Hassan, in today’s context, any Muslim-ruled state, which is a member of the United Nations, is by default in a peace agreement with all other members of the UN by way of the UN Charter. When a Muslim state enters the agreement to be a member of the UN, it actually enters a contract. Islam requires Muslims to fulfill all contracts that have been agreed upon, regardless of whether the contract was signed with Muslims or non-Muslims, as defined in The Quran, 5:1, 2:177.

<doc id="183058" wikidata="Q1588755" url="?curid=183058" title="Thrombus">
<text>A thrombus ( thrombi) is a solid or semisolid aggregate from constituents of the blood (platelets, fibrin, red blood cells, white blood cells) within the circulatory system during life. While a blood clot is the final product of the blood coagulation step in hemostasis in or out of the circulatory system. There are two components to a thrombus: aggregated platelets and red blood cells that form a plug, and a mesh of cross-linked fibrin protein. The substance making up a thrombus is sometimes called cruor. A thrombus is a healthy response to injury intended to stop and prevent further bleeding, but can be harmful in thrombosis, when a clot obstructs blood flow through a healthy blood vessel in the circulatory system.

In the microcirculation consisting of the very small and smallest blood vessels the capillaries, tiny thrombi known as microclots can obstruct the flow of blood in the capillaries. This can cause a number of problems particularly affecting the alveoli in the lungs of the respiratory system resulting from reduced oxygen supply. Microclots have been found to be a characteristic feature in severe cases of COVID-19 and in long COVID.

Mural thrombi are thrombi that adhere to the wall of a large blood vessel or heart chamber. They are most commonly found in the aorta, the largest artery in the body, more often in the descending aorta, and less often in the aortic arch or abdominal aorta. They can restrict blood flow but usually do not block it entirely. They appear grey-red along with alternating light and dark lines (known as lines of Zahn) which represent bands of white blood cells and red blood cells (darker) entrapped in layers of fibrin.

==Classification==
Thrombi are classified into two major groups depending on their location and the relative amount of platelets and red blood cells. The two major groups are:
# Arterial or white thrombi (characterized by predominance of platelets)
# Venous or red thrombi (characterized by predominance of red blood cells).

===Microclots===
In the microcirculation consisting of the very small and smallest blood vessels, the capillaries, tiny thrombi (microthrombi) known as microclots can obstruct the flow of blood in the capillaries. Microclots are small clumps of blood that form within the circulation, usually as a result of a larger thrombus breaking down into smaller pieces. They can be a cause for concern as they can lead to blockages in small vessels and restrict blood flow, leading to tissue damage and potentially causing ischemic events.

Microclots can cause a number of problems particularly affecting the alveoli in the lungs of the respiratory system, resulting from reduced oxygen supply. Microclots have been found to be a characteristic feature in severe cases of COVID-19, and in long COVID.

===Mural thrombi===

Mural thrombi form and adhere on the inner wall of a large blood vessel or heart chamber, often as a result of blood stasis. They are most commonly found in the aorta, the largest artery in the body, more often in the descending aorta, and less often in the aortic arch or abdominal aorta. They can restrict blood flow but usually do not block it entirely. Mural thrombi are usually found in vessels already damaged by atherosclerosis.

A mural thrombus can affect any heart chamber. When found in the left ventricle it is often a result of a heart attack complication. The thrombus in this case can separate from the chamber, be carried through arteries and block a blood vessel. They appear grey-red with alternating light and dark lines (known as lines of Zahn) which represent bands of white blood cells and red blood cells (darker) entrapped in layers of fibrin.

==Cause==

It was suggested over 150 years ago that thrombus formation is a result of abnormalities in blood flow, vessel wall, and blood components. This concept is now known as Virchow&#x27;s triad. The three factors have been further refined to include circulatory stasis, vascular wall injury, and hypercoagulable state, all of which contribute to increased risk for venous thromboembolism and other cardiovascular diseases.

Virchow&#x27;s triad describes the pathogenesis of thrombus formation:

# Endothelial injury: Injury to the endothelium (interior surface of blood vessel), causing platelet activation and aggregation;
#* Common causes include: trauma, smoking, hypertension, atheroma.
# Hemodynamic changes (stasis, turbulence): Blood stasis promotes greater contact between platelets/coagulative factors with vascular endothelium. If rapid blood circulation (e.g., because of tachycardia) occurs within vessels that have endothelial injuries, that creates disordered flow (turbulence) that can lead to the formation of thrombosis;
#* Common causes of stasis include anything that leads to prolonged immobility and reduced blood flow such as: trauma/broken bones and extended air travel.
# Hypercoagulability (also called thrombophilia; any disorder of the blood that predisposes to thrombosis);
#* Common causes include: cancer (leukaemia), factor V mutation (Leiden) – prevents Factor V inactivation leading to increased coagulability.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) involves widespread microthrombi formation throughout the majority of the blood vessels. This is due to excessive consumption of coagulation factors and subsequent activation of fibrinolysis using all of the body&#x27;s available platelets and clotting factors. The result is hemorrhaging and ischemic necrosis of tissue/organs. Causes are septicaemia, acute leukaemia, shock, snake bites, fat emboli from broken bones, or other severe traumas. DIC may also be seen in pregnant females. Treatment involves the use of fresh frozen plasma to restore the level of clotting factors in the blood, as well as platelets and heparin to prevent further thrombi formation.

==Pathophysiology==

A thrombus occurs when the hemostatic process, which normally occurs in response to injury, becomes activated in an uninjured or slightly injured vessel. A thrombus in a large blood vessel will decrease blood flow through that vessel (termed a mural thrombus). In a small blood vessel, blood flow may be completely cut off (termed an occlusive thrombus), resulting in death of tissue supplied by that vessel. If a thrombus dislodges and becomes free-floating, it is considered an embolus. If an embolus becomes trapped within a blood vessel, it blocks blood flow and is termed as an embolism. Embolisms, depending on their specific location, can cause more significant effects like strokes, heart attacks, or even death.

Some of the conditions which increase the risk of blood clots developing include atrial fibrillation (a form of cardiac arrhythmia), heart valve replacement, a recent heart attack (also known as a myocardial infarction), extended periods of inactivity (see deep venous thrombosis), and genetic or disease-related deficiencies in the blood&#x27;s clotting abilities.

===Formation===

Platelet activation occurs through injuries that damage the endothelium of the blood vessels, exposing the enzyme called factor VII, a protein normally circulating within the vessels, to the tissue factor, which is a protein encoded by the F3 gene.
The platelet activation can potentially cause a cascade, eventually leading to the formation of the thrombus. This process is regulated through thromboregulation.
==Prevention==
Anticoagulants are drugs used to prevent the formation of blood clots, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack and pulmonary embolism. Heparin and warfarin are used to inhibit the formation and growth of existing thrombi, with the former used for acute anticoagulation while the latter is used for long-term anticoagulation. The mechanism of action of heparin and warfarin are different as they work on different pathways of the coagulation cascade.

Heparin works by binding to and activating the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin III, an enzyme that acts by inactivating thrombin and factor Xa. In contrast, warfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme needed to synthesize vitamin K dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Bleeding time with heparin and warfarin therapy can be measured with the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and prothrombin time (PT), respectively.

==Treatment==
Once clots have formed, other drugs can be used to promote thrombolysis or clot breakdown. Streptokinase, an enzyme produced by streptococcal bacteria, is one of the oldest thrombolytic drugs. This drug can be administered intravenously to dissolve blood clots in coronary vessels. However, streptokinase causes systemic fibrinolytic state and can lead to bleeding problems. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a different enzyme that promotes the degradation of fibrin in clots but not free fibrinogen. This drug is made by transgenic bacteria and converts plasminogen into the clot-dissolving enzyme, plasmin. Recent research indicates that tPA could have toxic effects in the central nervous system. In cases of severe stroke, tPA can cross the blood–brain barrier and enter interstitial fluid, where it then increases excitotoxicity, potentially affecting permeability of the blood–brain barrier, and causing cerebral hemorrhage.

There are also some anticoagulants that come from animals that work by dissolving fibrin. For example, &quot;Haementeria ghilianii&quot;, an Amazon leech, produces an enzyme called hementin from its salivary glands.

==Prognosis==
Thrombus formation can have one of four outcomes: propagation, embolization, dissolution, and organization and recanalization.
# Propagation of a thrombus occurs towards the direction of the heart and involves the accumulation of additional platelets and fibrin. This means that it is anterograde in veins or retrograde in arteries.
# Embolization occurs when the thrombus breaks free from the vascular wall and becomes mobile, thereby traveling to other sites in the vasculature. A venous embolus (mostly from deep vein thrombosis in the lower limbs) will travel through the systemic circulation, reach the right side of the heart, and travel through the pulmonary artery, resulting in a pulmonary embolism. Arterial thrombosis resulting from hypertension or atherosclerosis can become mobile and the resulting emboli can occlude any artery or arteriole downstream of the thrombus formation. This means that cerebral stroke, myocardial infarction, or any other organ can be affected.
# Dissolution occurs when the fibrinolytic mechanisms break up the thrombus and blood flow is restored to the vessel. This may be aided by fibrinolytic drugs such as Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) in instances of coronary artery occlusion. The best response to fibrinolytic drugs is within a couple of hours, before the fibrin meshwork of the thrombus has been fully developed.
# Organization and recanalization involves the ingrowth of smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and endothelium into the fibrin-rich thrombus. If recanalization proceeds it provides capillary-sized channels through the thrombus for continuity of blood flow through the entire thrombus but may not restore sufficient blood flow for the metabolic needs of the downstream tissue.

<text>Earth Girls Are Easy is a 1988 American science fiction musical romantic comedy film that was produced by Tony Garnett, Duncan Henderson, and Terrence E. McNally and was directed by Julien Temple. The film stars Geena Davis, Julie Brown, Charles Rocket, Jeff Goldblum, Damon Wayans, and Jim Carrey. The plot is based on the song &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot; from Brown&#x27;s 1984 EP &quot;Goddess in Progress&quot;.

==Plot==
In the San Fernando Valley, Valerie Gail works as a manicurist at the Curl Up &amp; Dye salon. Dissatisfied with the lack of sexual interest from her fiancé, Dr. Ted Gallagher, she receives a makeover from her friend and the salon manager, Candy Pink. That night, Valerie sets out to seduce Ted, but instead, he arrives home with a nurse. Heartbroken and angry, Valerie kicks him out and destroys his belongings.

Meanwhile, three furry aliens—Mac, Zeebo, and Wiploc—from planet Jhazalla are traveling in a spaceship. It has been a long time since they have had female companionship, and they receive a broadcast showing human females. They are titillated by these &quot;hairless&quot;, shapely creatures. A fight between Zeebo and Wiploc causes the spaceship to plummet toward Earth, and they crash land into Valerie&#x27;s swimming pool while she sunbathes. Valerie is frightened at first, but then she invites the aliens into her home. She calls her surf bum friend Woody to come over and drain the pool so the aliens can repair their ship. Despite a language barrier, the aliens prove to be quick learners and absorb American pop culture and language by watching television.

Ted tries to call Valerie and leaves a message informing her that he will return home later that night. Fearing Ted&#x27;s reaction, Valerie takes Mac, Zeebo, and Wiploc to the salon. Although initially scared, Candy agrees to help the aliens blend into their surroundings. After having their fur shaved off, the aliens turn out to be human-looking and attractive. The group decides to go out and party at a local nightclub, where the aliens&#x27; looks, athleticism, and incredibly long tongues soon catch the eyes of every woman in the place. Valerie and Mac begin to fall for each other.

Ted arrives home and, finding Valerie missing, calls the police. She soon arrives with the aliens, claiming she won an MTV contest to spend the weekend with a rock band. Ted angrily demands that the aliens leave, but when two police officers arrive, Valerie tells them that Ted is attacking her guests. As the officers escort Ted away, he calls off the wedding. Despondent, Valerie retreats to her bedroom and Mac goes in to console her. They discover that they are anatomically compatible and have sex.

The next day, the pool is fully drained, and Zeebo and Wiploc are working on their ship when Woody stops by and offers to take them to the beach. They agree, and after accidentally holding up a convenience store, Zeebo and Wiploc are soon driving down a freeway the wrong way, in reverse, with the police in pursuit. Mac discovers his crew mates are in trouble and goes to help, but gets arrested along with Woody in a case of mistaken identity. Valerie smashes the police vehicle to get arrested, too, so she can go with Mac.

The police pursuit ends in a crash, and Zeebo and Wiploc are taken to the emergency room. There, they are examined by Ted, who discovers they have two hearts. While he is envisioning achieving fame and fortune from his discovery, Valerie and Mac elude the police and enter the emergency room disguised as a doctor and a nurse; they manage to convince Ted he is delusional. They then escape back to Valerie&#x27;s house where work continues on the spaceship. Meanwhile, Valerie and Ted reconcile and plan to elope to Las Vegas immediately.

Mac is heartbroken and prepares the ship for takeoff. Valerie goes to say goodbye to her alien friends, followed by Ted, who discovers the ship. While struggling to keep him from calling the authorities, Valerie realizes that Mac is the one she truly loves. She boards the spaceship and they take off.

==Cast==
==Production==
After the release of Julie Brown&#x27;s 1984 EP &quot;Goddess in Progress&quot;, Warner Bros. Pictures began writing a musical comedy based on the song &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;, starring Brown. The film was to have a screenplay written by Brown, Terrence McNally, and Charlie Coffey. The film was originally slated to go into production in 1986, but the studio lost confidence in the project when director Julien Temple&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; (1986), proved to be a dismal box-office failure. The role of Valerie Gail was offered to some of the era&#x27;s box-office draws such as Madonna and Molly Ringwald, but when they rejected it, Warner Bros. dropped the project. Several other studios expressed interest in producing the film, but none wanted Temple to direct. Ultimately, French bank Crédit Lyonnais agreed to finance the film with Temple at the helm (if $4 million was shaved off of the film&#x27;s estimated $14 million budget) and the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group agreed to distribute it.

Principal photography was finally underway in late 1987. Temple brought his own ideas to the project, including peppering the background with then-modern-sounding pop songs, featuring an homage to &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963), and using media personality Angelyne in a brief cameo (the director declared her &quot;the patron Saint of Los Angeles&quot;). However, Temple&#x27;s studious eye for detail caused delays on the set, and according to producer Tony Garnett, &quot;The first cut we had of the picture was a problem.&quot; The film underwent more than five months of post-production tinkering, including the removal of numerous scenes and the production number &quot;I Like &#x27;em Big and Stupid&quot; (a different version of the song plays in the club scene; the deleted sequence appears on the DVD extras) and reshoots later commenced (the song &quot;Cause I&#x27;m a Blonde&quot; was injected into the film late in production), by which time the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group had filed for bankruptcy.

The finished print of the film had several very positive previews, which captured the interest of potential distributors Nelson Entertainment, New World, MGM/UA, Carolco Pictures, Lorimar Studios, and 20th Century Fox, but ultimately Vestron Pictures acquired the distribution rights. The film debuted at the Toronto Festival of Festivals in September 1988 and was slated to be released the following February, but legal entanglements delayed its release until May 1989.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Box office returns were low, with the film earning only a little more than a third of its $10 million production cost.

The film grossed £172,880 in the United Kingdom.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot; is messy, silly, and not particularly bright – qualities it comes by honestly and deliberately.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 66 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert concluded, &quot;&quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot; is silly and predictable and as permanent as a feather in the wind, but I had fun watching it.&quot; &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; called it an &quot;[i]nfectiously goofy musical&quot; and went on to cite &quot;some good laughs&quot; and &quot;an endearing performance by Davis&quot;. George Anderson of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; gushed over the absurdity of the story, and how fun the film was, saying it &quot;is so cheerful about so many stupid things that you cannot, in good conscience, endorse it, but you may be tempted to adopt it.&quot; Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; criticized the film for being &quot;less a movie than a stretched-out, padded [music] video.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==
The accompanying soundtrack album was released on vinyl, cassette and CD by Sire Records on May 9, 1989. Most of the songs on the album are different mixes than were heard in the film, several songs from the film were omitted altogether and Geena Davis&#x27; song &quot;The Ground You Walk On&quot; was replaced with a rendition by Jill Jones.

Royalty&#x27;s song &quot;Baby Gonna Shake&quot; was issued as a single (available in several formats with numerous remix variations) and Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; rendition of &quot;Love Train&quot; was released as a single backed with the film&#x27;s title song, performed by The N.

==Legacy==
The film served as inspiration for the music video for the 2015 song &quot;Pretty Girls&quot; by American singer Britney Spears and Australian rapper Iggy Azalea.

==Stage show==
Beginning on September 16, 2001, there were several staged readings/performances of a musical play version of the film. Based on the film&#x27;s screenplay and written by Charlie Coffey and Michael Herrmann, Brown reprised her role as Candy, Kristin Chenoweth took over the role of Valerie, Marc Kudisch assumed the role of Ted and Hunter Foster was cast as Mac. Although costumes and props were utilized, there were no sets and the actors carried their scripts around the stage—these stagings were merely devised to find investors for the show.

The play did not feature any original songs; the performers sang renditions of 1980s pop songs along with several numbers from the film. The play followed the film&#x27;s story and scenes pretty closely, but a lot of new dialogue was written, a few characters were omitted, and there were some other slight deviations. Audio and video recordings of the September 30, 2002, staging are circulating, and several video clips from this performance have surfaced on YouTube.

Despite positive reaction, the timing of the initial staging was bad (coming mere days after the September 11 attacks), and even after subsequent readings, the show never attained the investors needed to become a full-blown production.

<text>Julie Ethel Dash (born October 22, 1952) is an American filmmaker, music video and commercial director, author, and website producer. Dash received her MFA in 1985 at the UCLA Film School and is one of the graduates and filmmakers known as the L.A. Rebellion. The L.A. Rebellion refers to the first African and African-American students who studied film at UCLA. Through their collective efforts, they sought to put an end to the prejudices of Hollywood by creating experimental and unconventional films. The main goal of these films was to create original Black stories and bring them to the main screens. After Dash had written and directed several shorts, her 1991 feature &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; became the first full-length film directed by an African-American woman to obtain general theatrical release in the United States. In 2004, &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; was named to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for its &quot;cultural, historical and aesthetic significance&quot;. Stemming from the film&#x27;s success, Dash also released novels of the same title in 1992 and 1999. The film was later a key inspiration for Beyoncé&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Lemonade&quot;.

&quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; is a fictionalized telling of her father&#x27;s Gullah family who lived off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia in 1902. Maintaining their strong ties to African culture, traditions, and language, the Peazant family ponders the meaning of their planned migration to the U.S. mainland. The film features black women&#x27;s stories, striking visuals shot on location and a non-linear narrative. Dash has written two books on &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot;—a &quot;making of&quot; history co-written with Toni Cade Bambara and bell hooks, and a sequel, set 20 years after the film&#x27;s story. &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; continues to have a widespread cultural impact today, as it was named one of the most significant films of the last 30 years, by IndieWire.

Dash has worked in television since the late 1990s. Her television movies include &quot;Funny Valentines&quot; (1999), &quot;Incognito&quot; (1999), &quot;Love Song&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot; (2002), starring Angela Bassett. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center commissioned Dash to direct &quot;Brothers of the Borderland&quot; in 2004, as an immersive film exhibit narrated by Oprah Winfrey following the path of women gaining freedom on the Underground Railroad. In 2017, Dash directed episodes of &quot;Queen Sugar&quot; on the Oprah Winfrey Network. Continuing her work in television, Dash has directed episodes of several TV series, namely &quot;Our Kind of People, Women of the Movement,&quot; and &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, throughout 2021 and 2022.

At the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, it was announced Dash&#x27;s next major project will be a biopic of civil rights activist Angela Davis, to be produced by Lionsgate.

As of 2017, along with working in television, Dash was named a Diana King Endowed Professor in the Department of Art &amp; Visual Culture at Spelman College. At Spelman, Dash is assisting to create a documentary filmmaking major. Dash has expressed that she is able to use her &quot;mechanical imagination&quot; in her classes, by focusing on aspects of film like frame composition and lighting. Using editing software like Premiere Pro in classes, she said in an interview that she does &quot;miss having filmstrips around [her] neck&quot;.

Dash is also a member of the Directors Guild of America, as she has been a member since 1996.

==Early life and education==
Dash was born on October 22, 1952, in Queens, New York, to Rhudine Henderson and Charles Edward Dash. She graduated from Jamaica High School then, went on to receive a B.A. in film production from the City College of New York in 1974. She was raised in the Queensbridge Housing Project in Long Island City, Queens. She studied in 1969 at the Studio Museum in Harlem. As an undergraduate, she studied psychology until she was accepted into the film school at the Leonard Davis Center for the Performing Arts at City Colleges of New York, CCNY. In 1974, she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Film Production. As a student, Dash wrote the script for a documentary for the New York Urban Coalition, titled &quot;Working Models of Success&quot;.

After graduating from CCNY, she moved to Los Angeles for graduate studies. She completed a two-year Conservatory Fellowship in Producing/Writing at AFI Conservatory. There she studied under filmmakers, including Ján Kadár, William Friedkin, and Slavko Vorkapich. She attended graduate school at the UCLA Film School and became one of a new generation of African and African-American filmmakers known as the &quot;Black insurgents&quot; or L.A. Rebellion.

She directed &quot;Working Models of Success&quot; (1976), and the next year, produced &quot;Four Women&quot; (1975), a short dance film based on a song by Nina Simone. It won a gold medal for Women in Film in the 1978 Miami International Film Festival. As a graduate student at UCLA, she received an MFA in Film and Television Production. She directed the film &quot;Diary of an African Nun&quot; (1977). Screened at the Los Angeles Film Exposition, it earned a Directors Guild Award for a Student Film.

==Career==

===Early career===
During film school, Dash was influenced by avant-garde, Latin American, African, and Russian cinema. Dash&#x27;s film work began to take on a new direction after film school. Dash said in a 1991 interview with the &quot;Village Voice&quot;: &quot;I stopped making documentaries after discovering Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, and Alice Walker. I wondered, why can&#x27;t we see movies like this? I realized I needed to learn how to make narrative movies.&quot; Being inspired by the novels of these black women authors led to her decision to direct dramatic films.

===&quot;Four Women&quot; (1975)===
Her 1975 short film &quot;Four Women&quot; is based on the ballad &quot;Four Women&quot; by Nina Simone. In the song, four women are portrayed (all by the dancer Linda Martina Young): Aunt Sarah, a slave, Saffronia, a mixed-race woman, Sweet Thing, a prostitute, and Peaches, as a representation of black women overcoming racial and gender-specific forms of oppression. The first character shown is Aunt Sarah who wears a long dress and represents slavery. The next character is Saffronia who wears a black dress and a black veil. She is a mixed-race woman who is the product of her mother being raped by a white man. The next character, Sweet Thing, is a prostitute. She wears a floral print dress and she is no longer covered by a veil. The last character is Peaches, who represents a black woman who has been toughened by generations of oppression. She wears cornrows, a brightly colored tube top, and matching pants. The overall message of this short is to show the different struggles that many black women are subjected to. Stereotypes of black women are directly addressed, asking the audience to address their own biases and stereotypes.

From 1978 to 1980, Dash worked as member of the Classifications and Ratings Administrations for the Motion Picture Association of America. She had a special assignment screening at the Cannes International Film Festival to review a screening of short films in the Marché du Cinema.

=== &quot;Diary of an African Nun&quot; (1977) ===
Dash&#x27;s 1977 short film &quot;Diary of an African Nun&quot; (13 minutes) was made during her tenure at UCLA. Adapted from Alice Walker&#x27;s short story of the same name, this feature follows a young nun (Barbara O. Jones) in Uganda who is riddled with emptiness and doubt as she ponders her vows and union with Christ. As the nights wear on, the rhythmic beating of drums in the village intensifies her anguish and worsens her anxieties. The graphic simplicity within &quot;Diary of an African Nun&quot; coupled with Dash&#x27;s poetic and political style won her a Directors Guild Award for student filmmaking at the Los Angeles Film Exposition. This style of narrative filmmaking directly challenged the conventions upheld by a longstanding history of white, male production. Diary of an African Nun is equipped with a certain intensity that foreshadows Dash&#x27;s later works such as Daughters of the Dust.

=== &quot;Illusions&quot; (1982) ===

She wrote and directed the short film &quot;Illusions&quot; (34 minutes), which explores racial and sexual discrimination in Hollywood and American society. Released in 1982, it was her first to earn more widespread success and attention. Set in 1942 in the fictional National Studios, it follows a black woman executive, Mignon Duprée, who has &quot;passed&quot; for white to achieve her position. Also featured is Ester Jeeter, a black woman who dubs the singing voice in musicals for a white Hollywood star. They work in an industry based on creating images and alternative realities. The film explores Mignon&#x27;s dilemma, Ester&#x27;s struggle to get roles as an actress and singer rather than dub for others, and the uses of cinema in wartime: three illusions in conflict with reality.

&quot;Illusions&quot; received the 1985 Black American Cinema Society Award and the Black Filmmaker Foundation&#x27;s Jury Prize in 1989 as best film of the decade. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as &quot;a gripping critique of the power of the movies to shape perception&quot;, while exploring the illusions created by Hollywood, as well as the illusion of racial identity. The success of this film and other shorts enabled Dash to move to feature films. In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

===&quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; (1991)===

Dash began work on a story in 1975 that was inspired by her father&#x27;s Gullah family background and immigration from the Sea Islands of Georgia. This would become the screenplay &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot;, which went into production after she received $800,000 in financing from PBS in 1988. The film, set in 1902, revolves around three generations of Gullah women in the Peazant family on St. Helena Island off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. Innovative with its use of Gullah dialogue and interwoven story-lines among the predominately female cast, the film focuses on ancestral and matriarchal story lines as well as the history of former slaves who settled on the island and formed an independent community there. The screenplay was written in the dialect of the island settlers with minimal subtitles, resulting in an immersive language experience.

Dash&#x27;s experimental approach to narrative structure was something rarely seen in U.S. feature-filmmaking. Upon the film&#x27;s re-release, she said: &quot;I...wanted to do a film that was so deeply embedded in the culture, was so authentic to the culture that it felt like a foreign film.&quot; The film is told in way that an African griot would tell a story. A griot would recall a family&#x27;s history over the course of days, all from their head. Dash brought in a Gullah consultant to help with the film. 

&quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 1991, where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize and won a cinematography award. It became the first feature film by an African-American woman to be distributed in the United States in theatrical release and gained critical praise for its use of dialect and music composed by John Barnes, as well for its cinematography and visual imagery.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Dash a &quot;strikingly original film maker&quot;, noting that &quot;for all its harsh allusions to slavery and hardship, the film is an extended, wildly lyrical meditation on the power of African cultural iconography and the spiritual resilience of the generations of women who have been its custodians.&quot;

The overriding intention for making this film was to make film about an African-American family who were not born into slavery. Dash also wanted to take a look at patterns, such as language, food, motor habits and aesthetics. Dash wanted to see all of this on film, as it had been previously denied due to the people making the film being mostly Europeans. This meant that the culture was not truly explored and the experiences of these families were being told from a European perspective.

Despite the critical acclaim, Dash was not able to get the financing to release another feature film, going on to work in television. &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; would continue to gain accolades for more than two decades. It was selected in 2004 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Its visuals would influence Beyoncé&#x27;s 2016 video album &quot;Lemonade&quot;, featuring young women on the beach, dressed in white gowns as in the movie, and gathering in front of an island cabin. On its 25th anniversary, the Cohen Media Group restored and distributed &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; for theatrical release, beginning at the 2016 Toronto Film Festival. Other screenings in celebration of the &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; 25th anniversary included Honolulu Museum of Art, AFI Silver Theater, and ARRAY @ The Broad held in Los Angeles at Theater at Ace Hotel.

===Styles and themes===
Dash started making films around the time of the L.A. Rebellion at UCLA, which trained many young black filmmakers who all had their own aesthetic visions, however, they all sought a vision of black authenticity. The L.A. Rebellion at UCLA produced many prominent filmmakers who were determined to reimagine the media production process while uplifting and sharing authentically black stories. The films that they were making could serve as both entertainment and education. Dash, who was a major influence and participant of the L.A. Rebellion, had a common theme in her work which was showcasing the lives of black women and the struggles that they faced. The themes in her films coincide with the idea that the L.A. rebellion was rebelling against. Which was how black people would be portrayed in film following the rise in popularity of blaxploitation films. Not only did Dash&#x27;s films showcase the lives of black people, but her work was also more primarily focused on the lives of black women and the struggles that are unique to black women. When making films she aims to say things that need to be said while saying it in a different way that hasn&#x27;t been done before.
In the video titled Julie Dash- The Reelback interview on YouTube, she says that her personal filmmaking mission statement is to redefine how we see African-American women on the screen. She wants to show their wants, their needs, their desires, their joys, their sorrows because all of the things that Dash was seeing bore little to no relation to the people she knew or the women who raised her. She wanted to change that because she wanted to see African-American women portrayed differently on the screen.

One theme that is coherent throughout Dash&#x27;s films, especially &quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot; and &quot;Illusions&quot; was the importance of remembrance and inheritance in African American culture. Black women take pride in sharing both their talent and their secrets to overcoming racist and sexist obstacles with younger generations. Dash&#x27;s characters carry this sentiment. Nana Peazant longed that her family&#x27;s African culture, language, and traditions would not be erased with most of their departure to the Mainland. She wanted them to achieve success while remembering their history and the sacrifices their ancestors made for their betterment (&quot;Daughters of the Dust&quot;). Similarly, Mignon wanted true stories depicted on cinema screens that would be relatable to all audiences—Black and white. She wanted Black women to take back ownership of their voice, craft, and talent (&quot;Illusions&quot;). All of these women wanted to leave the world knowing not only that their craft would live on, but that their children, loved ones, friends, and young Black people in general could take an easier route to discovering their true identity and freedom. One thing that these women did not want to pass on is their trauma. They endured hardships and sacrificed so that the new generation would not have to do the same. However, this is America; a system built upon structural racism and a racial hierarchy that scorns everyone who is not at the top. The trauma has endured. It has spanned decades with no end in sight. How do we stop it? One element that Dash&#x27;s work achieves is emphasizing the importance of inheritance and the role that trauma plays in affecting multiple generations of Black Americans without recreating or causing new trauma.

===Music videos===
Dash directed videos for musicians, including Raphael Saadiq with Tony, Toni, Tone, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;, Peabo Bryson, Adriana Evans, and Sweet Honey in the Rock. Her video for Tracy Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot; was nominated for MTV&#x27;s Best Female Vocalist in 1996.

===Television===
In 1997, Dash wrote and directed an episode of &quot;&quot; for the Showtime Cable Network, as well as &quot;Sax Cantor Riff,&quot; one of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Subway Stories: Tales from the Underground&quot; for producers Jonathan Demme and Rosie Perez. Dash directed the television film &quot;Funny Valentines&quot; in 1999, an account of a well-to-do black woman&#x27;s retreat from a troubled New York marriage to the Deep South and her childhood past. Alfre Woodard, and executive producer on the film, asked Dash to get involved. Dash wrote the screenplays and directed the television movies &quot;Incognito&quot; (1999), a romantic thriller made by BET Arabesque Films; and &quot;Love Song&quot; (2000), an MTV movie starring the Grammy award-winning singer Monica.

Actress and executive producer Angela Bassett asked Dash to direct the biopic &quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot; in 2002. The film follows Parks and her husband Raymond (Peter Francis James) as they deal with the issues of segregation, Jim Crow laws and second-class status in 1950s Alabama, leading up to Parks&#x27; refusing to relinquish her seat on a city bus, leading to the Montgomery bus boycott. &quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot; won several awards, including the NAACP Image Award for Best Television Movie. Dash was nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in the 55th Annual Directors Guild Awards—the first African-American woman nominated in the category of Primetime Movies Made for Television.

In 2004, Dash made &quot;Brothers of the Borderland&quot;, a work commissioned by the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. Narrated by Oprah Winfrey, the film features the character of Alice, an escaped slave whose story represents an amalgamation of historic figures. The film is shown in the Harriet Tubman theater, named for the fugitive slave woman who helped many others escape to freedom.

In December 2016, Dash guest-hosted on Turner Classic Movies to discuss dozens of films on the channel.

Dash joined the roster of female directors working on the second season of Ava DuVernay&#x27;s &quot;Queen Sugar&quot; on the OWN Network in 2017. She continued this work in television in 2021 and 2022 by directing several episodes of TV series airing on HULU, FOX, CBS, BET and others. These series are &quot;Our Kind of People, Women of the Movement,&quot; and &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;.

=== Museum installations ===
Dash designed two rooms for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and VOGUE, &quot;In American: An Anthology of Fashion&quot;, featured at the NYC Met Gala 2022. Her room titles were Renaissance Revival Room and Greek Revival Parlor. Within the Renaissance Revival Room, Dash chose to highlight Anne Lowe&#x27;s contribution to American fashion. Lowe was an extremely talented and exclusive gown designer in the 1940s. Due to the open and institutionalized racism in America during this time, Lowe never got recognition for her outstanding work. Dash took this opportunity to educate the world on Lowe&#x27;s impact upon fashion with this exhibit. Her other room, the Greek Revival Parlor, Dash highlighted Eartha Kitt as Helen of Troy in Orson Well&#x27;s &quot;Time Runs&quot; (1950). The MET Museum describes the impact of the room as, &quot;a narrative blend of reimagined storytelling, archival film images, and a dramatic evocation of historical moments, we dive headfirst into a strange and intimate conversation with the fashions of Madame Eta Hentz, the mythological Muses, and Ms. Eartha Kitt. Eartha Kitt is Helen of Troy, arriving from Sparta and taking the city of Troy by storm.&quot;

Dash&#x27;s other most recent museum installations include Standing at The Scratch Line, at the Philadelphia Museum of African American History, Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Shine a Light, a large-scale video mapping projection for the Charles H. Wright Museum in Detroit.

<text>Acelino &quot;Popó&quot; Freitas (; born September 21, 1975) is a Brazilian politician and a former professional boxer who competed between 1995 and 2017. He is a world champion in two weight classes, having held the WBO super featherweight title from 1999 to 2004, the WBA (Unified) super featherweight title from 2002 to 2004, and the WBO lightweight title twice between 2004 and 2007. After retiring from boxing, Freitas went into politics, and was elected as a legislator for the state of Bahia, from 2011 to 2014. His nickname, &quot;Popó&quot;, was given to him by his mother, after the sound that babies make while drinking milk.

==Early life==
Freitas had a difficult childhood, often sleeping on a sandy floor at his house. Since early in his life, he dreamed of a better place to live for his family. A skilled football player, he was more inclined, however, towards the sport of boxing since an early age. He was heavily influenced by his father and brothers, especially Luis Claudio Freitas.
Fellow Brazilian Eder Jofre, generally recognized as the greatest world champion to come out of that country, was one of Freitas&#x27; childhood heroes.

==Amateur career==

Freitas competed for his native country and won a lightweight silver medal at the Pan American Games 1995 in Mar del Plata.

== Professional career ==

=== Early success ===
After the Pan American Games he turned into a professional boxer on July 14, 1995, against Adriano Jose Soares. With his win by knockout in the first round that night, Freitas set off a streak of 29 knockout wins in a row, which places as one of the longest knockout wins streak in boxing history. His first 10 wins were against low level competition, but for fight number 11, he took on the much more experienced Edwin Vazquez, knocking him out in the seventh round.

Between 1997 and 1998, Freitas won four more fights and then took on Francisco Tomas Da Cruz, a former world title challenger of Julio César Chávez. Freitas handled Da Cruz with a knockout in two rounds and then added three more knockout wins before getting his first world title shot.

===First World Title===
On August 7, 1999, Freitas knocked out WBO Junior Lightweight Champion Anatoly Alexandrov in the first round. Soon after, he signed a contract with cable TV giant Showtime, which began to telecast Freitas&#x27; fights to the United States. Freitas then made five defenses of his world title and had one non-title bout, all of which ended in knockout wins. He then went to London and took only 45 seconds to stop Daniel Alicea in another non-title affair. Freitas then beat the former world champion: Al Kotey, the brother of David &#x27;Poison&#x27; Kotei, by a ten-round decision.

===Freitas vs Casamayor===
On January 12, 2002, Freitas decided to sign for a unification bout with the WBA world champion, Joel Casamayor, a Cuban refugee who resides in Florida. In a rousing super featherweight unification title bout battle between unbeaten champions, a controversial knockdown and a blatant foul cost Casamayor his unblemished record and his title as Freitas won a close 12 round unanimous decision.

In a classic boxing confrontation between the Brazilian bomber Freitas (129½) and the Cuban boxer Casamayor (129½), the fighters switched roles midway through their encounter in what was reminiscent of Sugar Ray Leonard&#x27;s first historic face-off with Thomas &quot;Hitman&quot; Hearns back in 1981. The scientist Casamayor became the aggressive slugger, while the puncher Freitas turned into the boxer as once again the unpredictable transpired in a mega-fight.

A glancing right-hand to the neck of the off-balanced Casamayor in the 3rd round was ruled a knockdown by referee Joe Cortez and intentionally hitting on the break in the 6th saw the Cuban penalized another point. It was the difference in the finale tallies and the two point cushion that the tiring Freitas retained across the boards on all three judges scorecards. Ring officials Robert Byrd, Bill Graham and Dave Moretti having identical scores of 114 to 112 for the Brazilian.

===After Casamayor===
Next, he went to Phoenix, to fight Nigerian Daniel Attah, with only the WBO belt on the line, winning a 12-round decision on August 3, 2002. The fight was watched by an estimated 91 million viewers in Brazil.

Freitas then retained the title in Chicago with a fourth-round knockout of Juan Carlos Ramirez. On August 9, 2003, he and Jorge Barrios engaged in what Showtime commentator Steve Albert called a &quot;candidate for fight of the year&quot;. Freitas was floored in rounds eight and eleven, but retaliated with a knockdown of his own towards the end of the eleventh, and ended up retaining the title by knockout in round twelve.

Freitas began 2004 by winning a 12-round unanimous decision over Artur Grigorian on January 4, to become the WBO&#x27;s world Lightweight champion. On February 1 of that year, the WBA announced it had named Freitas their 2003 &quot;Fighter of the year&quot;.

===Freitas vs Corrales===
On August 7, 2004, Freitas lost for the first time, losing his WBO Lightweight title to Diego Corrales by TKO in the tenth round after being knocked down by a left hook in Connecticut.

===After Corrales===
On April 29, 2006, Freitas defeated Zahir Raheem for the vacant WBO lightweight title by split decision. Freitas announced his retirement as a professional boxer on October 4, 2006. Later on, he announced his come back from retirement, and the WBO re-instated him as their lightweight champion.

On April 28, 2007, he fought Juan Diaz in Mashantucket, USA, losing by TKO after his trainer stopped the bout at the beginning the 9th round, drawing boos from the crowd.

He has fought three times since his last loss (2012, 2015, and most recently in November 2017), all wins against inferior competition and all in South America (two wins by knockout and one win by 8-round unanimous decision).

==Personal life==

Freitas&#x27; childhood hero was Brazilian boxer Eder Jofre. His career in boxing was heavily influenced by his older brother Luis Claudio Freitas.

He has been able to help his family financially and has built a soccer field in his mansion, allowing him to practice his second favorite sport.

Freitas&#x27; married wife Eliana Guimarães in 2001, they divorced in 2003.

He was Secretary of Sports in Salvador and is member of Brazilian Republican Party.

The careers of Acelino Freitas and Luis Claudio Freitas are depicted in the 2019 biographical TV series &quot;Irmãos Freitas&quot;, directed by Walter Salles and Sérgio Machado. Brazilian actors Daniel Rocha and Rômulo Braga co-star as Acelino Freitas and Luis Claudio Freitas.

In 2024, Acelino Freitas performed cosplayed as chimarrão in the reality singing competition &quot;The Masked Singer Brasil&quot;.

<doc id="183065" wikidata="Q158765" url="?curid=183065" title="George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon">
<text>George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, (26 June 1866 – 5 April 1923), styled Lord Porchester until 1890, was an English peer and aristocrat best known as the financial backer of the search for and excavation of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb in the Valley of the Kings.

==Background and education==
Styled Lord Porchester from birth, he was born at 66 Grosvenor Street, Mayfair, London, the only son of Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, a distinguished Tory statesman, by his first wife Lady Evelyn Stanhope, daughter of Anne and George Stanhope, 6th Earl of Chesterfield. Aubrey Herbert was his half-brother. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He inherited the Bretby Hall estate in Derbyshire from his maternal grandmother, Anne Elizabeth, Dowager Countess of Chesterfield in 1885, and succeeded his father in the earldom in 1890.

He was High Steward of Newbury.

==Family==

Lord Carnarvon married Almina Victoria Maria Alexandra Wombwell, alleged to be the illegitimate daughter of millionaire banker Alfred de Rothschild, of the Rothschild family, at St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster, on 26 June 1895. Rothschild provided a marriage settlement of £500,000 (equivalent to £ in ), and paid off all Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s existing debts. The Carnarvons had two children:
* Henry George Herbert, 6th Earl of Carnarvon (1898–1987), who married Anne Catherine Tredick Wendell (d. 1977) and had one son (the 7th Earl) and one daughter. They divorced in 1936 and from 1939 to 1947 he was married to actress and dancer Tilly Losch.
* Lady Evelyn Leonora Almina Herbert (1901–1980), who married Sir Brograve Beauchamp, 2nd Baronet, and had a daughter.

==Horse racing==
Exceedingly wealthy due to his marriage settlement, Carnarvon was at first best known as an owner of racehorses, and in 1902 he established Highclere Stud to breed thoroughbred racehorses. He joined the Jockey Club and in 1905 was appointed one of the stewards at the new Newbury Racecourse and acted as a steward at other racecourses. His family has maintained the connection ever since. His grandson, the 7th Earl, was racing manager to Queen Elizabeth II from 1969 until his death in 2001.

==Egyptology==

Lord Carnarvon was a keen motor-car driver. In 1903 he suffered a serious motoring accident near Bad Schwalbach in Germany, after which he never fully recovered his health. After a lengthy convalescence his doctors advised that he winter out of England and from then on he and Lady Carnarvon often spent their winters in Egypt. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur Egyptologist and also bought Egyptian antiquities for their collection in England.

In 1907 Lord Carnarvon undertook to sponsor the excavation of nobles&#x27; tombs in Deir el-Bahri, near Thebes. He employed Howard Carter to undertake the work on the recommendation of Gaston Maspero, director of the Egyptian Antiquities Department. In 1912 Carnarvon published &quot;Five Years&#x27; Exploration at Thebes&quot;, cowritten with Carter, describing their excavations.

In 1914 Lord Carnarvon received the concession to dig in the Valley of the Kings, replacing Theodore Davis, who had resigned. Carter again led the work, undertaking a systematic search of the Valley for any tombs missed by previous expeditions, in particular that of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Excavations were interrupted during the First World War but resumed in late 1917. By 1922 little of significance had been found and Lord Carnarvon decided this would be the final year he would fund the work. However on 4 November 1922 Carter was able to send a telegram to Lord Carnarvon in England, saying: &quot;At last we have made wonderful discovery in Valley; a magnificent tomb with seals intact; re-covered same for your arrival; congratulations.&quot;

Lord Carnarvon, accompanied by his daughter, Lady Evelyn Herbert, returned to Egypt, arriving at Luxor on 23 November 1922. Both were present the next day when the full extent of the stairway to the tomb was cleared and a seal containing Tutankhamun&#x27;s cartouche found on the outer doorway. This door was removed and the rubble-filled corridor behind cleared, revealing the door of the tomb itself. Carnarvon was also present when on 26 November Carter made a tiny breach in the top left-hand corner of this doorway, enabling him to peer in by the light of a candle. When Carnarvon asked, &quot;Can you see anything?&quot; Carter replied &quot;Yes, wonderful things!&quot; The tomb was then secured, to be entered in the presence of an official of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities the next day. However that night Carter, his assistant Arthur Callender, Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn apparently made an unauthorised visit, becoming the first people in modern times to enter the tomb. Some sources suggest that the group also entered the inner burial chamber. In this account a small hole was found in the chamber&#x27;s sealed doorway and Carter, Carnarvon and Lady Evelyn crawled through.

The next morning, 27 November, saw an inspection of the tomb in the presence of an Egyptian official. Callender rigged up electric lighting, illuminating a vast haul of items, including gilded couches, chests, thrones and shrines. They also saw evidence of two further chambers, including the sealed doorway to the inner burial chamber, guarded by two life-size statues of Tutankhamun. In spite of evidence of break-ins in ancient times, the tomb was virtually intact and would ultimately be found to contain more than 5,000 items.

On 29 November the tomb was officially opened in the presence of a number of invited dignitaries and Egyptian officials.

Lord Carnarvon travelled to England in December 1922, returning in January 1923 to be present at the official opening of the inner burial chamber on 16 February. Before the opening Carnarvon had sold the exclusive newspaper rights to report the excavation to &quot;The Times&quot;. Whilst this helped finance the work it created resentment both from other newspapers and from the Egyptian authorities, whose own press was also excluded.

Towards the end of February a rift with Carter, probably caused by a disagreement on how to manage the supervising Egyptian authorities, temporarily closed excavation. Work recommenced in early March after Carnarvon had apologised. This was to be Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s last significant involvement in the excavation project since he fell seriously ill shortly afterwards.

==Death==

On 19 March 1923 Carnarvon suffered a severe mosquito bite, which became infected after a razor cut. On the 5th of April he died in the Continental-Savoy Hotel in Cairo from, according to contemporary reports, blood poisoning progressing to pneumonia. On 14 April Lady Almina Carnarvon moved Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s remains to England. His tomb appropriately reflects his archaeological interest, being situated within an ancient hill fort on Beacon Hill overlooking his Highclere family seat.

After Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s death Carter continued the excavation. However the Egyptian government took ownership of the contents of the tomb and in April 1930 provided a grant of £35,000 to his heirs (equivalent to £ in ).

===Legends and speculations===
Encouraged by newspaper speculation, the ‘Curse of Tutankhamun’, or the ‘Mummy&#x27;s Curse’ entered into popular culture and was fuelled further by the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s suggestion that Carnarvon&#x27;s death had been caused by ‘elementals’ created by Tutankhamun&#x27;s priests to guard the royal tomb. On 3rd April 1923, just six weeks after Howard Carter had unsealed the burial chamber in the tomb of Tutankhamun, Conan Doyle arrived in New York to begin a four-month lecture tour on Spiritualism. Two days later he was asked by a reporter whether he connected the breaking news of Carnarvon’s death with the curse of the pharaohs. Conan Doyle responded to this question by drawing parallels between the death of Carnarvon and his late friend Bertram Fletcher Robinson, and his comments were reported in an article, which appeared in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper on 7th April 1923, as follows:

In 1998 it was argued in the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot; that Conan Doyle may well have been right, owing to research (published in &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot;) by Sylvain Gandon, then of the Laboratoire d’Écologie in Paris, on the longevity and potency of toxic spores, as well as comments by archaeologist Nicholas Reeves on &quot;reports of a black fungus inside the tomb&quot;. Howard Carter dismissed such speculation as &#x27;&#x27;, commenting that &quot;the sentiment of the Egyptologist [...] is not one of fear, but of respect and awe [...] entirely opposed to foolish superstitions&quot;. Carter also asked a scientist he knew to test for possible pathogens on one of Tutankhamun&#x27;s bandages, and the test reportedly found nothing. But modern testing of Egyptian mummies has found the presence of the toxic fungus &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;, whose spores also reportedly killed scientists after the opening of a 15th century royal tomb in Poland in 1973, and Carnarvon (and other alleged victims such as George Jay Gould and Arthur Mace) showed symptoms that were at least arguably consistent with poisoning by its spores.

Some of the stories were clearly fabricated, including that a curse had been found inscribed on the wall of the tomb, while a study showed that those involved in the tomb&#x27;s discovery and clearance did not have a lower than average life expectancy. In 2003 a study of documents and scholarly sources led &quot;The Lancet&quot; to conclude as unlikely that Carnarvon&#x27;s death had anything to do with Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, refuting another theory that exposure to toxic spores, such as those of the toxic fungus (mycotoxin) &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;, had contributed to his demise. Although he was one of those to enter the tomb on several occasions, none of the other 25 from Europe was affected in the months after their entries. The cause of Carnarvon&#x27;s death was reported as ‘pneumonia supervening on [facial] erysipelas&#x27; (a streptococcal infection of the skin and underlying soft tissue). Pneumonia was thought to be only one of various complications arising from the progressively invasive infection that eventually resulted in multiorgan failure.&quot; The Earl had been &quot;prone to frequent and severe lung infections&quot; according to &quot;The Lancet&quot; and there had been a &quot;general belief ... that one acute attack of bronchitis could have killed him. In such a debilitated state, the Earl&#x27;s immune system was easily overwhelmed by erysipelas.” The above-mentioned &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; speculation was revived in a 2022 documentary by Channel 4 that argued that its spores were a possible cause of Carnarvon&#x27;s death (and possibly also of the deaths of Gould and Mace).

==In popular culture==
*Carnarvon has been portrayed several times in film, video game and television productions, with events portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy:
** By Harry Andrews in the 1980 Columbia Pictures Television production &quot;The Curse of King Tut&#x27;s Tomb&quot;.
** By Julian Curry in the 1998 IMAX documentary &quot;Mysteries of Egypt&quot;.
** By Julian Wadham in the 2005 BBC docudrama &quot;Egypt&quot;.
** By Sam Neill in the 2016 ITV series &quot;Tutankhamun&quot;.
* In the film &quot;The Mummy&quot; the character Evelyn Carnahan is named in tribute to Lord Carnarvon&#x27;s daughter, Lady Evelyn, whose father, although not named, is described as one of Egyptology&#x27;s &quot;finest patrons&quot;.
* &#x27;Lord Carnarvon&#x27; is the quest leader for the Archaeologist role in the classic text-based computer game &quot;NetHack&quot;.
* His country house, Highclere Castle, serves as the exterior and upstairs filming location of the ITV/PBS television series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. The below-stairs scenes were filmed on a set in London, since Highclere&#x27;s basement is the home of Carnarvon&#x27;s Egyptian collection. Highclere is owned by the present earl.

<text>Old Sarum, in Wiltshire, South West England, is the ruined and deserted site of the earliest settlement of Salisbury. Situated on a hill about north of modern Salisbury near the A345 road, the settlement appears in some of the earliest records in the country. It is an English Heritage property and is open to the public.

The great stone circles of Stonehenge and Avebury were erected nearby and indications of prehistoric settlement have been discovered from as early as 3000 BC. An Iron Age hillfort was erected around 400 BC, controlling the intersection of two trade paths and the Hampshire Avon. The site continued to be occupied during the Roman period, when the paths were made into roads. The Saxons took the British fort in the 6th century and later used it as a stronghold against marauding Vikings. The Normans constructed a motte and bailey castle, a stone curtain wall, and a great cathedral. A royal palace was built within Old Sarum Castle for and was subsequently used by Plantagenet monarchs. This heyday of the settlement lasted for around 300 years until disputes between the Sheriff of Wiltshire and the Bishop of Salisbury finally led to the removal of the church into the nearby plain. As New Salisbury grew up around the construction site for the new cathedral in the early 13th century, the buildings of Old Sarum were dismantled for stone and the old town dwindled. Its long-neglected castle was abandoned by in 1322 and sold by in 1514. Edward Rutherfurd&#x27;s 1987 novel &quot;Sarum&quot; traces the history of the town.

Although the settlement was effectively uninhabited, its landowners continued to have parliamentary representation into the 19th century, making it one of the most notorious of the rotten boroughs that existed before the Reform Act 1832. Old Sarum served as a pocket borough of the Pitt family.

Old Sarum is also the name of a modern settlement north-east of the monument, where there is a grass strip airfield and a small business park, and large 21st-century housing developments.

== Name ==

The present name seems to be a ghost word or corruption of the medieval Latin and Norman forms of the name Salisbury, such as the Sarisburie that appeared in the Domesday Book of 1086. (These were adaptions of the earlier names Searoburh, Searobyrig, and Searesbyrig, calques of the indigenous Brittonic name with the Old English suffixes and , denoting fortresses or their adjacent settlements.) The longer name was first abbreviated as &quot;Sar̅&quot;, but, as such a mark was used to contract the Latin suffix &quot;-um&quot; (common in placenames), the name was confused and became Sarum sometime around the 13th century. The earliest known use was on the seal of the hospital at New Salisbury, which was in use in 1239. The 14th-century Bishop Wyvil was the first to describe himself as &quot;episcopus Sarum&quot;.

The addition of &#x27;old&#x27; to the name distinguished it from Sarum or New Sarum, names used in some contexts for the newer settlement.

== History ==
=== Prehistory ===
There is evidence that early hunters and, later, farming communities occupied the site. A protective hill fort, named &quot;Sorviodunum&quot;, was constructed by the local inhabitants around 400 BC during the Iron Age by creating enormous banks and ditches surrounding the hill. The hillfort is broadly oval shaped, measuring in length and in width. It consists of a double bank and intermediate ditch with an entrance on the eastern side.

Numerous other hillforts of the same period can be found locally, including Figsbury Ring to the east and Vespasian&#x27;s Camp to the north. The archaeologist Sir R. C. Hoare described it as &quot;a city of high note in the remotest periods by the several barrows near it, and its proximity to the two largest stone circles in England, namely, Stonehenge and Avebury.&quot;

=== Roman period ===
At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century, the area of Old Sarum seems to have formed part of the territory of the Atrebates, a British tribe apparently ruled by Gaulish exiles. Although the dynasty&#x27;s founder Commius had become a foe of Caesar&#x27;s, his sons submitted to Augustus as client kings. Their realm became known as the Regni and the overthrow of one of them, Verica, was the casus belli used to justify the Emperor Claudius&#x27;s invasion. The settlement appeared in the Welsh &quot;Chronicle of the Britons&quot; as or Gradawc () and as Caer-Wallawg. Bishop Ussher argued for its identification with the listed among the 28 cities of Britain by the &quot;History of the Britons&quot; traditionally ascribed to Nennius.

=== Saxon period ===
Cynric, king of Wessex, captured the hill in 552. It remained part of Wessex thereafter but, preferring settlements in bottomland like nearby Wilton, the Saxons largely ignored Old Sarum until the Viking invasions led to restore its fortifications. In the early part of the 9th century, it was a frequent residence of Egbert of Wessex and, in 960, assembled a national council there to plan a defence against the Danes in the north. Along with Wilton, it was abandoned by its residents to be sacked and burned by the Dano-Norwegian king Sweyn Forkbeard in 1003. It subsequently became the site of Wilton&#x27;s mint.

=== Norman period ===

A motte-and-bailey castle was built by 1069, three years after the Norman conquest. The castle was held directly by the Norman kings; its castellan was generally also the sheriff of Wiltshire. In 1075, the Council of London established Herman as the first bishop of Salisbury (&quot;&quot;), uniting his former sees of Sherborne and Ramsbury into a single diocese which covered the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, and Berkshire. He and Saint Osmund began the construction of the first Salisbury cathedral but neither lived to see its completion in 1092. Osmund was a cousin of William the Conqueror and Lord Chancellor of England; he was responsible for the codification of the Sarum Rite, the compilation of the Domesday Book, and—after centuries of advocacy from Salisbury&#x27;s bishops—was finally canonized by Pope in 1457.

The Domesday Book was probably presented to William I at Old Sarum in 1086, the same year he convened the prelates, nobles, sheriffs, and knights of his dominions there to pay him homage by the Oath of Salisbury. Two other national councils were held there: one by William Rufus in 1096 and another by Henry I in 1116, which has sometimes been described as the first English Parliament. William Rufus confirmed its bishop in various additional sources of income, which were later confirmed by Henry II.

The cathedral was consecrated on 5 April 1092 but suffered extensive damage in a storm, traditionally said to have occurred only five days later. Bishop Roger was a close ally of who served as his viceroy during the king&#x27;s absence to Normandy and directed the royal administration and exchequer along with his extended family. He refurbished and expanded Old Sarum&#x27;s cathedral in the 1110s. This work ultimately doubled the cathedral&#x27;s length and involved the large-scale levelling of the ecclesiastical district in the northwest quadrant of the town. He began work on a royal palace during the 1130s, prior to his arrest by Henry&#x27;s successor Stephen. This palace was long thought to have been the small structure whose ruins are located in the small central bailey; it may, however, have been the large palace recently discovered in the southeast quadrant of the outer bailey. This palace was , surrounded a large central courtyard, and had walls up to thick. A room was probably a great hall and there seems to have been a large tower. At the time of Roger&#x27;s arrest by , the bishop administered the castle on the king&#x27;s behalf; it was thereafter allowed to fall into disrepair but the sheriff and castellan continued to administer the area under the king&#x27;s authority.

=== Angevin period ===

Medieval Sarum also seems to have had industrial facilities such as kilns and furnaces. Residential areas were principally located in the two southern quadrants, built up beside the ditch protecting the inner bailey and Norman castle. Henry II held his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, prisoner at Old Sarum. In the 1190s, the plain between Old Sarum and Wilton was one of five specially designated by for the holding of English tournaments.

An early 12th-century observer, William of Malmesbury, called Sarum a town &quot;more like a castle than city, being environed with a high wall&quot;, and noted that &quot;notwithstanding that it was very well accommodated with all other conveniences, yet such was the want for water that it sold at a great rate&quot;. Holinshed denied this and noted that the hill was &quot;very plentifully served with springs and wells of very sweet water&quot;; excavation has discovered numerous wells (including one within the Norman keep) but suggests that they were so deep as to make their use more cumbersome than carting water uphill from the rivers. The issue was presented to kings Richard and John as the prime reason to relocate the cathedral but seems to have only been part of the issue.

The late 12th-century canon Peter of Blois described his prebendary as &quot;barren, dry, and solitary, exposed to the rage of the wind&quot; and the cathedral &quot;as a captive on the hill where it was built, like the ark of God shut up in the profane house of Baal.&quot; Holinshed records that the clerics brawled openly with the garrison troops. Bishop Herbert received permission for the move from Richard I, who was agreeably disposed towards the diocese after discovering it held in coin in trust for his father, in addition to jewels, vestments, and plate, but was forced to delay the change after John&#x27;s succession.

By papal order, Herbert&#x27;s brother Richard Poore was translated from Chichester to succeed him in 1217; the next year, Sarum&#x27;s dean and chapter presented arguments to Rome for the cathedral&#x27;s relocation. The investigation of these claims by the papal legate Cardinal Gualo verified the chapter&#x27;s claims that the site&#x27;s water was both expensive and sometimes restricted by the castellans; that housing within the walls was insufficient for the clerics, who were required to rent from the laity; that the wind was sometimes so strong that divine offices could not be heard and the roof was repeatedly damaged; and that the soldiers of the royal fortress restricted access to the cathedral precinct to the common folk during Ash Wednesday and on other occasions for providing the Eucharist and the clerics felt imperilled by their circumstances. thereupon issued an indulgence to relocate the cathedral on 29 March 1217 or 1218. The chapter voted unanimously for the move and agreed to pay for it by withholding various portions of their prebends over the next seven years. On Easter Monday, 1219, a wooden chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary was begun near the banks of the Hampshire Avon; on Trinity Sunday, Bishop Poore celebrated mass there and consecrated a cemetery. On Day, April 28, 1220, the foundation of the future stone cathedral was begun.

The settlement that grew up around it was called New Salisbury, then (at least formally) New Sarum, then finally Salisbury. The former cathedral was formally dissolved in 1226. The inhabitants of the new city gradually razed the old, constructing Salisbury Cathedral and other buildings from the materials at Old Sarum. Evidence of quarrying into the 14th century shows some continued habitation, but the settlement was largely abandoned and ordered the castle&#x27;s demolition in 1322.

=== Modern period ===

The castle grounds were sold by in 1514. From the reign of Edward II in the 14th century, the borough of Old Sarum elected two Members of Parliament to the House of Commons despite having, from at least the 17th century, no resident voters. One of the members in the 18th century was William Pitt the Elder. In 1831, Old Sarum had eleven voters, all of whom were landowners who lived elsewhere, making Old Sarum the most notorious of the rotten boroughs. The Reform Act 1832 subsumed the Old Sarum area into an enlarged borough of Wilton. The fortified site was an extra-parochial area and became a civil parish in 1858, but the civil parish was abolished in 1894 and merged with Stratford sub Castle. In 1891 the parish had a population of 13. The site and surrounding area is now the northernmost part of Salisbury civil parish.

The site of the castle and cathedral is considered a highly important British monument: it was among the 26 English locations scheduled by the 1882 Ancient Monuments Protection Act, the first such British legislation. That protection has subsequently continued, expanding to include some suburban areas west and south-east of the outer bailey. It was also listed as a Grade I site in 1972.

Between 1909 and 1915, W.H. St J. Hope, W. Hawley, and D.H. Montgomerie excavated the site for the Society of Antiquaries of London. A second excavation occurred in the 1950s under John W. G. Musty and Philip Rahtz.

In 2014, an on-site geophysical survey of the inner and outer bailey by the University of Southampton revealed its royal palace, as well as the street plan of the medieval city. The survey made use of soil resistivity to electric current, electrical resistivity tomography, magnetometry, and ground-penetrating radar. The team planned to return in 2015 to complete a similar survey of the Romano-British site to the south of the hillfort.

== 20th and 21st centuries ==
The Old Sarum monument is now administered by English Heritage, and non-members are charged for admission. A paved carpark and grass overflow carpark are provided in the eastern area of the outer bailey.

In 1917, during World War I, farmland about north-east of Old Sarum, along the Portway, was developed as the &#x27;Ford Farm&#x27; aerodrome. That became Old Sarum Airfield, which remained in operation with a single grass runway until at least 2019 with a small business park which developed along the north edge of the airfield. As of January 2023 the airfield is still operational, but only by prior arrangement.

Around 800 homes were built on the north side of the Portway between 2008 and 2016, and this area (which includes Old Sarum Primary School) is also called Old Sarum. From 2018, further housing called Longhedge Village, around 750 homes accessed from the A345, was built immediately north of the earlier development. These areas all fall within Laverstock civil parish, while the monument itself – separated from modern development by about of farmland – is within the Salisbury City area.

<text>Ephedraceae is a family of gymnosperms belonging to Gnetophyta, it contains only a single extant genus, &quot;Ephedra&quot;, as well as a number of extinct genera from the Early Cretaceous.

== Taxonomy ==
Ephedraceae is agreed to be the most basal group amongst extant gnetophytes. Members of the family typically grow as shrubs and have small, linear leaves that possess parallel veins. The fossil Ephedraceae genera show a range of morphologies transitional between the ancestral lax male and female reproductive structures and the highly compact reproductive structures typical of modern &quot;Ephedra&quot;. Modern members of &quot;Ephedra&quot; have either dry winged membranous bracts (modified leaves which surround the seed), which are dispersed by wind, leathery covered seeds, which are dispersed by seed-eating rodents, or fleshy bracts which are consumed and then dispersed by birds. Some extinct members of &quot;Ephedra&quot; from the Early Cretaceous, such as &quot;Ephedra carnosa&quot;, as well as &quot;Arlenea&quot; from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil have fleshy bracts surrounding the seeds, suggesting that these seeds were dispersed by animals.

<doc id="183076" wikidata="Q127264" url="?curid=183076" title="Yamaguchi Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Chūgoku region of Honshu. Yamaguchi Prefecture has a population of 1,377,631 (1 February 2018) and has a geographic area of 6,112 km2 (2,359 sq mi). Yamaguchi Prefecture borders Shimane Prefecture to the north and Hiroshima Prefecture to the northeast.

Yamaguchi is the capital and Shimonoseki is the largest city of Yamaguchi Prefecture, with other major cities including Ube, Shūnan, and Iwakuni. Yamaguchi Prefecture is located at the western tip of Honshu with coastlines on the Sea of Japan and Seto Inland Sea, and separated from the island of Kyushu by the Kanmon Straits.

== History ==
Yamaguchi Prefecture was created by the merger of the provinces of Suō and Nagato. During the rise of the samurai class during the Heian and Kamakura Periods (794–1333), the Ouchi family of Suō Province and the Koto family of Nagato Province gained influence as powerful warrior clans. In the Muromachi period (1336—1573), Ouchi Hiroyo, the 24th ruler of the Ouchi family conquered both areas of Yamaguchi Prefecture. The Ouchi clan imitated the city planning of Kyoto. They gained great wealth through cultural imports from the continent and trade with Korea and Ming Dynasty China. As a result, Yamaguchi came to be known as the &quot;Kyoto of the West,&quot; and Ouchi culture flourished. Sue Harutaka defeated the 31st ruler of the Ouchi clan. The Sue clan was then defeated by Mōri Motonari, and the Mōri family gained control of the Chūgoku region. Yamaguchi was ruled as part of the Mōri clan domain during the Sengoku period. Mōri Terumoto was then defeated by Tokugawa Ieyasu in the battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was forced to give up all his land except for the Suō and Nagato areas (current-day Yamaguchi Prefecture), where he built his castle in Hagi. Mōri sought to strengthen the economic base of the region and increase local production with his Three Whites campaign (salt, rice, and paper).

After Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s opening of Japan, clans from Nagato (also called Chōshū) played a key role in the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate and the establishment of the new imperial government.
Four years after the Edo Shogunate was overthrown and the Meiji government formed in 1868, the present Yamaguchi Prefecture was established. The Meiji government brought in many new systems and modern policies, and promoted the introduction of modern industry, though the prefecture was still centered on agriculture during this period. In the Taishō period, from 1912 to 1926, shipbuilding, chemical, machinery, and metal working plants were built in Yamaguchi&#x27;s harbors in the Seto Inland Sea area. During the post-World War II Shōwa Period, Yamaguchi developed into one of the most industrialized prefectures in the country due to the establishment of petrochemical complexes.

== Geography ==
As of April 1, 2012, 7% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Setonaikai National Park; Akiyoshidai, Kita-Nagato Kaigan, and Nishi-Chūgoku Sanchi Quasi-National Parks; and Chōmonkyō, Iwakiyama, Rakanzan, and Toyota Prefectural Natural Parks.

===Mergers===
==Economic development==
For the purposes of development analysis, Yamaguchi is construed to be part of Northern Kyushu. Although Yamaguchi is not part of the island of Kyushu, it has become a functional satellite of the Kanmon Straits metropolitan area.

==Demographics==

Per Japanese census data, Yamaguchi prefecture has had negative population growth from 1955 to 1973 and 1985–onwards, today at edge of having less than 1940 population leaving elderly behind.

== Tourism ==
The most popular place for tourism is Shimonoseki, which has the Karato Fish Market and a large fireworks festival in summer.

Another attraction is the Kintai Bridge in the town of Iwakuni. This five-arched wooden structure is considered a symbol of Western Honshū. The area on the banks of the Nishiki river close to the bridge is considered among the best places in Japan for Hanami, when groups of family and friends gather in early April to view cherry blossoms.

Hagi City is in the north of Yamaguchi. It is a very traditional city. The usual color of Japanese post boxes is red, but in Hagi they are painted green or brown. The Hagi Museum is modeled after a traditional samurai residence. The exhibits are detailed and realistic, and are changed every year. The permanent collection is data about Hagi&#x27;s history and collections about Takasugi Shinsaku. Hagi also contains a reverberatory furnace which has been designated a World Heritage Site.

Kawara soba (hot tile noodles) is a popular dish in Yamaguchi. It was developed during the Seinan Rebellion when soldiers cooked wild grass and meat on hot tiles. Today people in Yamaguchi create this dish by frying green tea noodles on a hot tile, and arranging a thin fried egg, stewed beef, green onions, and grilled liver on top. 

Akiyoshidai Quasi-National Park, which includes Japan&#x27;s longest cave, the , is another popular destination.

Three of the new single-member districts have been held exclusively by Liberal Democrats as of 2013, the easternmost district bordering Hiroshima was initially won by Shinji Satō (Eisaku Satō&#x27;s son) in 1996, but went to Democrat Hideo Hiraoka in several later elections.

For the proportional representation segment of the House of Representatives, Yamaguchi forms part of the Chūgoku block.

<text>Jelly Babies are a type of soft sugar jelly sweets in the shape of plump babies, sold in a variety of colours. They were first manufactured in Lancashire, England, in the nineteenth century. Their popularity waned before being revived by Bassett&#x27;s of Sheffield in Yorkshire, who began mass-producing Jelly Babies (initially sold as &quot;Peace Babies&quot;) in 1918.

==History==
&quot;Jelly Babies&quot; are known at least since advertisements by Riches Confectionery Company of 22 Duke Street, London Bridge in 1885, along with a variety of other baby sweets, including &quot;Tiny Totties&quot; and &quot;Sloper’s Babies&quot;. But the pricing of these, at one farthing each, suggests that they were very much larger than the modern Jelly Baby.

The sweets were invented in 1864 by an Austrian immigrant working at &quot;Fryers of Lancashire&quot;, and were originally marketed as &quot;Unclaimed Babies&quot;. By 1918 they were produced by Bassett&#x27;s in Sheffield as &quot;Peace Babies&quot;, to mark the end of World War I. Bassett&#x27;s themselves have supported the &quot;Peace Babies&quot; name. Production was suspended during World War II due to wartime shortages. The product was relaunched as &quot;Jelly Babies&quot; in 1953.

A line of sweets called Jellyatrics was launched by Barnack Confectionery Ltd to commemorate the &quot;Jelly Baby’s 80th Birthday&quot; in March 1999. Jellyatrics celebrate &quot;all that is great and good about the older generation&quot;.

==Manufacture==

The most noted modern manufacturer of Jelly Babies, Bassett&#x27;s, now allocate individual name, shape, colour and flavour to different babies: Brilliant (red; strawberry), Bubbles (yellow; lemon), Baby Bonny (pink; raspberry), Boofuls (green; lime), Bigheart (purple; blackcurrant), and Bumper (orange).

The introduction of different shapes and names was an innovation, circa 1989, prior to which all colours of jelly baby were a uniform shape. Bassett&#x27;s Jelly Babies changed in September 2007 to include only natural colours and ingredients. There are many brands of jelly babies, as well as supermarket own brands.

Jelly Babies manufactured in the United Kingdom tend to be dusted in starch, which is left over from the manufacturing process, where it is used to aid release from the mould. Jelly Babies manufactured in Australia generally lack this coating. Like most other gummy sweets, they contain gelatin.

==In popular culture==

In October 1963, as Beatlemania was breaking out, fans of The Beatles in the United Kingdom pelted the band with jelly babies (or, in the United States, the much harder jelly beans) after it was reported that George Harrison liked eating them.

Beginning in the Second Doctor era of the popular British science fiction television series Doctor Who, but especially during that of Tom Baker&#x27;s Fourth Doctor, jelly babies were frequently featured as a plot device in which the Doctor would attempt to ease an awkward moment or prevent potential conflict with an unfamiliar being by offering, &quot;would you like a jelly baby?&quot;

In the series by Terry Pratchett, &quot;Discworld&quot;, the country of Djelibeybi (a pun on &quot;jelly baby&quot;, but putatively meaning &quot;Child of the (River) Djel&quot;, and possibly derived from djellaba), is the Discworld&#x27;s analogue of Ancient Egypt. The main setting of &quot;Pyramids&quot;, Djelibeybi is about two miles (3200 m) wide, along the 150-mile (240 km) length of the Djel.

Australian singer, Alison Hams, released the &quot;Jelly Baby Song&quot; in May 2013 – its content alluding to the consumption of jelly babies by Type 1 Diabetics to overcome hypoglycaemic episodes – as a way to raise awareness for Type 1 Diabetes, for JDRF Australia (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) who sell specially packaged jelly babies, as the focus of their annual campaign &quot;Jelly Baby Month&quot;.

A popular school chemistry experiment, is to put them in a strong oxidising agent, and see the resulting spectacular reaction. The experiment is commonly referred to as &quot;screaming jelly babies&quot;.

A poll of 4,000 adults in Britain voted jelly babies their sixth favourite sweet in August 2009. Jelly Babies are the favourite snack of Basil Brush, a British fox puppet.

In the 2018 film &quot;Johnny English Strikes Again&quot;, the titular character (played by Rowan Atkinson) carries a box of jelly babies with him, but they are actually disguised explosives, as in said context, &quot;jelly&quot; is actually short for gelignite, and they blow up whomever eats them.

<text>Dimitrie or Demetrius Cantemir (; ; 26 October 1673 – 21 August 1723), also known by other spellings, was a Moldavian prince, statesman, and man of letters. He twice served as voivode of Moldavia (March–April 1693 and 1710–1711). During his second term he allied his state with Russia in a war against Moldavia&#x27;s Ottoman overlords; Russia&#x27;s defeat forced Cantemir&#x27;s family into exile and the replacement of the native voivodes by Greek phanariots. Cantemir was also a prolific writer, variously a philosopher, historian, composer, musicologist, linguist, ethnographer, and geographer. His son Antioch, Russia&#x27;s ambassador to Great Britain and France and a friend of Montesquieu and Voltaire, would become known as &quot;the father of Russian poetry&quot;.

==Name==
Dimitrie is the Romanian form of the name Latinized as Demetrius and, less often, anglicized as Demeter. The Russian form of his name was (). He is also known as &quot;Dimitri Kantemiroğlu&quot; in Turkish contexts, &quot;Dymitr Kantemir&quot; in Polish, and &quot;Dēmētrios Kantimērēs&quot; () in Greek. His surname Cantemir (Kantemir) is of Turkic/Tatar origin, &quot;kan&quot; meaning &quot;blood&quot; and &quot;temir&quot; meaning &quot;iron&quot;.

==Life==

Dimitrie was born in Silişteni, Moldavia (now Vaslui County, Romania) on 26 October 1673 to Constantin Cantemir and Ana Bantăș. His mother was a learned daughter of a local noble family. In 1685, Constantin was named voivode of Moldavia by its Turkish overlords.

Although Constantin himself was illiterate, he educated his sons Dimitrie and Antioh thoroughly. Dimitrie learned Greek and Latin to read the classics as a child. One of his tutors was the scholar John Komnenos Molyvdos. Between 1687 and 1710, Dimitrie spent most of his time as a hostage or envoy in Constantinople, living in the palace he owned, where he learned Turkish and studied Ottoman history at the Patriarchate&#x27;s Greek Academy. While there, he also composed Ottoman music.

Upon Constantin&#x27;s death in 1693, Dimitrie briefly succeeded him to the voivodeship but was passed over within three weeks in favour of Constantin Duca, whose candidacy was supported by his father-in-law, the Wallachian voivode Constantin Brâncoveanu. When his brother Antioh eventually succeeded to the control of Moldavia, Dimitrie served as his envoy to the Porte. During these years, he also served with distinction in the Turkish army on its campaigns.

In 1710, Dimitrie was appointed voivode in his own right. Believing Ottoman Turkey to be collapsing, he placed Moldavia under Russian control through a secret agreement signed at Lutsk (Treaty of Lutsk). Then he joined Peter the Great in his war against the Turks. This ended in failure at Stănilești (18–22 July 1711) and the Cantemirs were forced into Russian exile. In 1712, Peter I presented Bogorodskoye District (Black Mud) to the former Moldavian ruler.

He travelled to Russia along with many other noble families, most important and close being Septilici family and Abaza, who were also made princely/noble in russian ranks. Dimitrie was made both a Russian prince (&quot;knyaz&quot;) by Peter and a prince of the Holy Roman Empire by Charles VI. He lived on an estate at Dmitrovka near Oryol, with a sizable boyar retinue (including the chronicler Ion Neculce). There he died on 21 August 1723, on the very day he was awarded his German title. In 1935, his remains were returned to Iași.

==Family==
Cantemir was married twice: to Princess Cassandra Cantacuzino (1682–1713), daughter of Prince Șerban Cantacuzino and supposed descendant of the Byzantine Kantakouzenoi, in 1699, and to Princess Anastasiya Trubetskaya (1700–1755) in 1717. Cantemir&#x27;s children were rather prominent in Russian history. His elder daughter Maria Cantemir (1700–1754) so attracted Peter the Great that he allegedly planned to divorce his wife Catherine to be with her. Upon Catherine&#x27;s own ascension to the throne, however, Maria was forced to enter a convent. Cantemir&#x27;s son Antioch (1708–1744) was the Russian ambassador at London and Paris, a friend of Voltaire and Montesquieu, and so influential a poet, satirist, and essayist as to be considered &quot;the father of Russian poetry&quot;. Another son Constantin (1703–1747) was implicated in the Golitsyn conspiracy against the empress Anna and was exiled to Siberia. Dimitrie&#x27;s younger daughter Smaragda (1720–1761), reckoned one of the great beauties of her time, was the wife of Prince Dmitriy Mikhailovich Golitsyn and a friend of the empress Elizabeth.

==Historical works==
Cantemir was a polyglot known as one of the greatest linguists of his time, speaking and writing eleven languages. Well-versed in Oriental scholarship, his &quot;oeuvre&quot; is voluminous, diverse, and original, although some of his scientific writings contain unconfirmed theories or simple inaccuracies. Between 1711 and 1719 he wrote his most important creations. In 1714, he was named a member of the Royal Academy of Berlin.

Cantemir&#x27;s best-known history work was his &quot;History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire&quot; (the original title was in Latin, &quot;Historia incrementorum atque decrementorum Aulae Othomanicae&quot;). This volume circulated throughout Europe in manuscript for a number of years. It was finally printed in 1734 in London and was later translated and printed in Germany and France. It remained the seminal work on the Ottoman Empire up to the middle of the 19th century; notably, it was used as a reference for Edward Gibbon&#x27;s own &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;. Later scholarship contests many points owing to the dubiousness of some of Cantemir&#x27;s sources.

He also published the first critical history of Romania as a whole, the &quot;Chronicle of the Antiquity of the Romano-Moldavo-Wallachians&quot; (&quot;&quot;), from 1719 to 1722. It asserted the Latin origin of the Romanian language and the Roman origin of the people living within the former land of Dacia.

Cantemir wrote his &quot;Descriptio Moldaviae&quot; (&quot;Description of Moldavia&quot; in Latin) in 1714 at the request of the Royal Academy in Berlin. Covering geographical, ethnographical, and economic aspects of Moldavia, it was similarly circulated in manuscript and only published much later. It appeared in a German geographical magazine in 1769 and was published as a book in 1771. His manuscript map of Moldova was the first real map of the country, containing geographical detail as well as administrative information. Printed in 1737 in the Netherlands, it formed the basis of most European maps of the country for decades.

His 1705 roman à clef &quot;A Hieroglyphic History&quot; was the first Romanian novel, representing the history of the Wallachian Brâncoveanu and Cantacuzino dynasties through allegorical and mythological animals.

He also wrote an introduction to Islam for Europeans, a biography of Jan Baptist van Helmont, a philosophical treatise in Romanian and Greek, and an unfinished second treatise on the &quot;Undepictable Image of Sacred Science&quot;.

Due to his many esteemed works, he won great renown at the high courts of Europe. His name is among those who were considered to be the brightest minds of the world on a plaque at the Library of Sainte-Genevieve in Paris, next to those of Leibniz, Newton, Piron, and other great thinkers.

== Musical works ==
A few of Cantemir&#x27;s roughly forty Ottoman compositions are still performed today as part of the Turkish repertoire, but his greatest service was in preserving 350 traditional instrumental pieces by publishing them in a musical notation he developed from the Ottoman Turkish alphabet in his work &quot;Edvar-i Musiki&quot;, offered as a present to Sultan Ahmed III in 1703 or 1704 and recently reprinted with modern explanations.

In 1999, the Bezmara ensemble recorded &quot;Yitik Sesin Peşinde&quot; (&quot;In Search of the Lost Sound&quot;) from the Cantemir transcriptions using period instruments. His compositions, those of his European contemporaries and Moldavian folk music of the period were explored on &quot;Cantemir&quot; (Golden Horn Records, 2000) performed by İhsan Özgen and the Lux Musica ensemble under Linda Burman-Hall&#x27;s direction. Seven of Cantemir&#x27;s compositions were also featured on Hespèrion XXI&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Istanbul&quot;, under the direction of Jordi Savall, with focus on Cantemir&#x27;s “Book of the Science of Music”.

==Istanbul Museum==
One of the houses inhabited by Dimitrie Cantemir during his exile in Constantinople was restored and opened as a museum in 2007. It lies in the Fener quarter of the walled city between Phanar College and the Golden Horn.
