<text>James Arthur Baldwin (né Jones; August 2, 1924 – December 1, 1987) was an African-American writer and civil rights activist who garnered acclaim for his essays, novels, plays, and poems. His 1953 novel &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; has been ranked by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the top 100 English-language novels. His 1955 essay collection &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot; helped establish his reputation as a voice for human equality. Baldwin was an influential public figure and orator, especially during the civil rights movement in the United States.

Baldwin&#x27;s fiction posed fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures. Themes of masculinity, sexuality, race, and class intertwine to create intricate narratives that influenced both the civil rights movement and the gay liberation movement in mid-twentieth century America. His protagonists are often but not exclusively African-American; gay and bisexual men feature prominently in his work (as in his 1956 novel &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot;). His characters typically face internal and external obstacles in their search for self- and social acceptance.

Baldwin&#x27;s work continues to influence artists and writers. His unfinished manuscript &quot;Remember This House&quot; was expanded and adapted as the 2016 documentary film &quot;I Am Not Your Negro&quot;, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary. His 1974 novel &quot;If Beale Street Could Talk&quot; was adapted into a 2018 film of the same name, which earned widespread praise.

==Early life==
===Birth and family===
Baldwin was born as James Arthur Jones to Emma Berdis Jones on August 2, 1924, at Harlem Hospital in New York City. Born on Deal Island, Maryland, in 1903, Emma Jones was one of many who fled racial segregation and discrimination in the South during the Great Migration. She arrived in Harlem, New York, when she was 19 years old. Baldwin was born out of wedlock there. Jones never revealed to him who his biological father was.

Jones originally undertook to care for her son as a single mother. However, in 1927, Jones married David Baldwin, a laborer and Baptist preacher. David Baldwin was born in Bunkie, Louisiana, and preached in New Orleans, but left the South for Harlem in 1919. How David and Emma met is uncertain, but in James Baldwin&#x27;s semi-autobiographical &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot;, the characters based on the two are introduced by the man&#x27;s sister. Emma Baldwin and David Baldwin had eight children in sixteen years—George, Barbara, Wilmer, David Jr. (named for James&#x27;s stepfather and deceased half-brother), Gloria, Ruth, Elizabeth, and Paula. James took his stepfather&#x27;s last name. James rarely wrote or spoke of his mother. When he did, he made it clear that he admired and loved her, often through reference to her loving smile. James moved several times while young but always within Harlem. At the time, Harlem was still a mixed-race area of the city in the incipient days of the Great Migration.

James Baldwin did not know exactly how old his stepfather was, but it is clear that he was much older than Emma; indeed, he may have been born before the Emancipation in 1863. David&#x27;s mother, Barbara, was born enslaved and lived with the Baldwins in New York before her death when James was seven years old. David also had a light-skinned half-brother fathered by his mother&#x27;s erstwhile enslaver and a sister named Barbara, whom James and others in the family called &quot;Taunty&quot;. David&#x27;s father was born a slave. David had been married earlier and had a daughter, who was as old as Emma and at least two sons―David, who died while in jail, and Sam, who was eight years James&#x27; senior. Sam lived with the Baldwins for a time and once saved James from drowning.

James Baldwin referred to his stepfather simply as &quot;father&quot; throughout his life, but David Sr. and James had an extremely difficult relationship and nearly resorted to physical fights on several occasions. &quot;They fought because James read books, because he liked movies, because he had white friends&quot;, all of which, David Baldwin thought, threatened James&#x27;s &quot;salvation&quot;. According to one biographer, David Baldwin also hated white people and &quot;his devotion to God was mixed with a hope that God would take revenge on them for him.&quot; During the 1920s and 1930s, David worked at a soft-drink bottling factory, although he was eventually laid off from the job. As his anger and hatred eventually tainted his sermons, he was less in demand as a preacher. David sometimes took out his anger on his family and the children were afraid of him, though this was to some degree balanced by the love lavished on them by their mother. 

David Baldwin grew paranoid near the end of his life. He was committed to a mental asylum in 1943 and died of tuberculosis on July 29 of that year, the same day Emma had their last child, Paula. James, at his mother&#x27;s urging, visited his dying stepfather the day before and came to something of a posthumous reconciliation with him in his essay, &quot;Notes of a Native Son.&quot; In the essay he wrote, &quot;in his outrageously demanding and protective way, he loved his children, who were black like him and menaced like him&quot;. David Baldwin&#x27;s funeral was held on James&#x27; 19th birthday, around the same time that the Harlem riot began.

As the oldest child, James Baldwin worked part-time from an early age to help support his family. He was molded not only by the difficult relationships in his household but also by the impacts of the poverty and discrimination he saw all around him. As he grew up, friends he sat next to in church turned to drugs, crime, or prostitution. In what biographer Anna Malaika Tubbs found to be a commentary on not only his own life but also the entire Black experience in America, Baldwin wrote, &quot;I never had a childhood... I did not have any human identity... I was born dead.&quot;

===Education and preaching===
Baldwin wrote comparatively little about events at school. At five years of age, he was enrolled at Public School 24 (P.S. 24) on 128th Street in Harlem. The principal of the school was Gertrude E. Ayer, the first Black principal in the city. She and some of Baldwin&#x27;s teachers recognized his brilliance early on and encouraged his research and writing pursuits. Ayer stated that Baldwin derived his writing talent from his mother, whose notes to school were greatly admired by the teachers, and that her son also learned to write like an angel, albeit an avenging one. By fifth grade, not yet a teenager, Baldwin had read some of Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s works, Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, and Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (which gave him a lifelong interest in the work of Dickens). Baldwin wrote a song that earned praise from New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in a letter that La Guardia sent to him. Baldwin also won a prize for a short story that was published in a church newspaper. His teachers recommended that he go to a public library on 135th Street in Harlem, a place that became his sanctuary. Baldwin would request on his deathbed that his papers and effects be deposited there.

It was at P.S. 24 that Baldwin met Orilla &quot;Bill&quot; Miller, a young white schoolteacher from the Midwest whom Baldwin named as one of the reasons that he &quot;never really managed to hate white people&quot;. Among other outings, Miller took Baldwin to see an all-Black rendition of Orson Welles&#x27;s take on &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Lafayette Theatre, from which flowed Baldwin&#x27;s lifelong desire to succeed as a playwright. David was reluctant to let his stepson go to the theatre, because he saw the stage as sinful and was suspicious of Miller. However, Baldwin&#x27;s mother insisted, reminding his father of the importance of education. Miller later directed the first play that Baldwin ever wrote.

After P.S. 24, Baldwin entered Harlem&#x27;s Frederick Douglass Junior High School. There, Baldwin met two important influences. The first was Herman W. &quot;Bill&quot; Porter, a Black Harvard graduate. Porter was the faculty advisor to the school&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Douglass Pilot&quot;, of which Baldwin would become the editor. Porter took Baldwin to the library on 42nd Street to research a piece that would turn into Baldwin&#x27;s first published essay titled &quot;Harlem—Then and Now&quot;, which appeared in the autumn 1937 issue of the &quot;Douglass Pilot&quot;. The second of these influences from his time at Frederick Douglass Junior High School was Countee Cullen, the renowned poet of the Harlem Renaissance. Cullen taught French and was a literary advisor in the English department. Baldwin later remarked that he &quot;adored&quot; Cullen&#x27;s poetry, and his dream to live in France was sparked by Cullen&#x27;s early impression on him. Baldwin graduated from Frederick Douglass Junior High in 1938.

In 1938, Baldwin applied to and was accepted at De Witt Clinton High School in the Bronx, a predominantly white and Jewish school, where he matriculated that fall. He worked on the school&#x27;s magazine, the &quot;Magpie&quot; with Richard Avedon, who went on to become a noted photographer, and Emile Capouya and Sol Stein, who would both become renowned publishers. Baldwin did interviews and editing at the magazine and published a number of poems and other writing. He completed his high school diploma at De Witt Clinton in 1941. Baldwin&#x27;s yearbook listed his career ambition as &quot;novelist-playwright&quot;, and his motto in the yearbook was: &quot;Fame is the spur and—ouch!&quot;

Uncomfortable with his discovery during his high school years that he was attracted to men rather than women, Baldwin sought refuge in religion. He joined the now-demolished Mount Calvary of the Pentecostal Faith Church on Lenox Avenue in 1937. He then followed Mount Calvary&#x27;s preacher, Bishop Rose Artemis Horn (who was affectionately known as Mother Horn) when she left to preach at Fireside Pentecostal Assembly. At the age of 14, &quot;Brother Baldwin&quot;, as he was called, first took to Fireside&#x27;s altar, and it was at Fireside Pentecostal, during his mostly extemporaneous sermons, that Baldwin &quot;learned that he had authority as a speaker and could do things with a crowd.&quot; He delivered his final sermon at Fireside Pentecostal in 1941. Baldwin wrote in the essay &quot;Down at the Cross&quot; that the church &quot;was a mask for self-hatred and despair ... salvation stopped at the church door&quot;. He recalled a rare conversation with David Baldwin &quot;in which they had really spoken to one another&quot;, during which his stepfather asked: &quot;You&#x27;d rather write than preach, wouldn&#x27;t you?&quot;

===Later years in New York===
Baldwin left school in 1941 in order to earn money to help support his family. He secured a job helping to build a United States Army depot in New Jersey. In the middle of 1942, Emile Capouya helped Baldwin get a job laying tracks for the military in Belle Mead, New Jersey. The two lived in Rocky Hill and commuted to Belle Mead. In Belle Mead, Baldwin experienced prejudice that deeply frustrated and angered him and that he cited as the partial cause of his later emigration out of America. Baldwin&#x27;s fellow white workmen, who mostly came from the South, derided him for what they saw as his &quot;uppity&quot; ways, his sharp, ironic wit and his lack of &quot;respect&quot;.

In an incident that Baldwin described in his essay &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot;, he went to a restaurant in Princeton called the Balt where, after a long wait, Baldwin was told that &quot;colored boys&quot; were not served there. Then, on his last night in New Jersey, in another incident also memorialized in &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot;, Baldwin and a friend went to a diner after a movie, only to be told that Black people were not served there. Infuriated, he went to another restaurant, expecting to be denied service once again. When that denial of service came, humiliation and rage overcame Baldwin and he hurled the nearest object at hand—a water mug—at the waitress, missing her and shattering the mirror behind her. Baldwin and his friend narrowly escaped.

During these years, Baldwin was torn between his desire to write and his need to provide for his family. He took a succession of menial jobs and feared that he was becoming like his stepfather, who had been unable to provide properly for his family. Fired from the track-laying job, Baldwin returned to Harlem in June 1943 to live with his family after taking a meat-packing job. He lost the meat-packing job too, after falling asleep at the plant. He became listless and unstable, drifting from one odd job to the next. Baldwin drank heavily and endured the first of his nervous breakdowns.

Beauford Delaney helped Baldwin cast off his melancholy. During the year before he left De Witt Clinton, and at Capuoya&#x27;s urging, Baldwin had met Delaney, a modernist painter, in Greenwich Village. Delaney would become Baldwin&#x27;s long-time friend and mentor, and helped demonstrate to Baldwin that a Black man could make his living in art. Moreover, when World War II bore down on the United States during the winter after Baldwin left De Witt Clinton, the Harlem that Baldwin knew was atrophying—no longer the bastion of a Renaissance, the community grew more economically isolated, and he considered his prospects there to be bleak. This led him to move to Greenwich Village, a place that had fascinated him since at least the age of 15.

Baldwin lived in several locations in Greenwich Village, the first being with Delaney, then with a scattering of other friends. He took a job at the Calypso Restaurant, an unsegregated eatery famous for the parade of prominent Black people who dined there. At the Calypso, Baldwin worked under Trinidadian restaurateur Connie Williams. During this time, Baldwin continued to explore his sexuality, coming out to Capouya and another friend, and to frequent Calypso guest, Stan Weir. Baldwin also had numerous one-night stands with various men, and several relationships with women. His major love during his Village years was an ostensibly straight Black man named Eugene Worth. Worth introduced Baldwin to the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League and Baldwin became a Trotskyist for a brief period. Baldwin never expressed his desire for Worth, and Worth died by suicide after jumping from the George Washington Bridge in 1946. In 1944, Baldwin met Marlon Brando, to whom he was also attracted, at a theater class at The New School. The two became fast friends, a friendship that endured through the Civil Rights Movement and long after. In 1945, Baldwin started a literary magazine called &quot;The Generation&quot; with Claire Burch, who was married to Brad Burch, Baldwin&#x27;s classmate from De Witt Clinton. Baldwin&#x27;s relationship with the Burches soured in the 1950s but was resurrected towards the end of his life.

Near the end of 1945, Baldwin met Richard Wright, who had published the novel &quot;Native Son&quot; several years earlier. Baldwin&#x27;s main objective for that initial meeting was to interest Wright in an early manuscript of what would later become &quot;Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot;, but that was at the time titled &quot;Crying Holy&quot;. Wright liked the manuscript and encouraged his editors to consider Baldwin&#x27;s work, but an initial $500 advance from Harper &amp; Brothers was dissipated with no book to show for the money, and Harper eventually declined to publish the book at all. Nonetheless, Baldwin regularly sent letters to Wright in the subsequent years and would reunite with Wright in Paris, France, in 1948 (though their relationship took a turn for the worse soon after the Paris reunion).

During his Village years, Baldwin made a number of connections in New York&#x27;s liberal literary establishment, primarily through Worth: Sol Levitas at &quot;The New Leader&quot; magazine, Randall Jarrell at &quot;The Nation&quot;, Elliot Cohen and Robert Warshow at &quot;Commentary&quot;, and Philip Rahv at &quot;Partisan Review&quot;. Baldwin wrote many reviews for &quot;The New Leader&quot;, but was published for the first time in &quot;The Nation&quot; in a 1947 review of Maxim Gorki&#x27;s &quot;Best Short Stories&quot;. Only one of Baldwin&#x27;s reviews from this era made it into his later essay collection &quot;The Price of the Ticket&quot;: a sharply ironic assay of Ross Lockridge&#x27;s &quot;Raintree Countree&quot; that Baldwin wrote for &quot;The New Leader&quot;. Baldwin&#x27;s first essay, &quot;The Harlem Ghetto&quot;, was published a year later in &quot;Commentary&quot; and explored anti-Semitism among Black Americans. His conclusion was that Harlem was a parody of white America, with white American anti-Semitism included. Jewish people were also the main group of white people that Black Harlem dwellers met, so Jews became a kind of synecdoche for all that the Black people in Harlem thought of white people. Baldwin published his second essay in &quot;The New Leader&quot;, riding a mild wave of excitement over &quot;Harlem Ghetto&quot;: in &quot;Journey to Atlanta&quot;, Baldwin uses the diary recollections of his younger brother David, who had gone to Atlanta, Georgia, as part of a singing group, to unleash a lashing of irony and scorn on the South, white radicals, and ideology itself. This essay, too, was well received.

Baldwin tried to write another novel, &quot;Ignorant Armies&quot;, plotted in the vein of &quot;Native Son&quot; with a focus on a scandalous murder, but no final product materialised. Baldwin spent two months during the summer of 1948 at Shanks Village, a writer&#x27;s colony in Woodstock, New York. He then published his first work of fiction, a short story called &quot;Previous Condition&quot;, in the October 1948 issue of &quot;Commentary&quot; magazine, about a 20-something Black man who is evicted from his apartment—the apartment being a metaphor for white society.

==Career==
===Life in Paris (1948–1957)===

Disillusioned by the reigning prejudice against Black people in the United States, and wanting to gain external perspectives on himself and his writing, Baldwin settled in Paris, France, at the age of 24. Baldwin did not want to be read as &quot;merely a Negro; or, even, merely a Negro writer.&quot; He also hoped to come to terms with his sexual ambivalence and escape from the hopelessness to which many young African-American men like himself succumbed.

In 1948, Baldwin received a $1,500 grant () from a Rosenwald Fellowship in order to produce a book of photographs and essays that was to be both a catalog of churches and an exploration of religiosity in Harlem. Baldwin worked with a photographer friend named Theodore Pelatowski, whom Baldwin met through Richard Avedon. Although the book (titled &quot;Unto the Dying Lamb&quot;) was never finished, the Rosenwald funding did allow Baldwin to realise his long-standing ambition of moving to France. After saying his goodbyes to his mother and his younger siblings, with forty dollars to his name, Baldwin flew from New York to Paris on November 11, 1948. He gave most of the scholarship funds to his mother. Baldwin would later give various explanations for leaving America—sex, Calvinism, an intense sense of hostility which he feared would turn inward—but, above all, was the problem of race, which, throughout his life, had exposed him to a lengthy catalog of humiliations. He hoped for a more peaceable existence in Paris.

In Paris, Baldwin was soon involved in the cultural radicalism of the Left Bank. He started to publish his work in literary anthologies, notably &quot;Zero&quot; which was edited by his friend Themistocles Hoetis and which had already published essays by Richard Wright.

Baldwin spent nine years living in Paris, mostly in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, with various excursions to Switzerland, Spain, and back to the United States. Baldwin&#x27;s time in Paris was itinerant: he stayed with various friends around the city and in various hotels. Most notable of these lodgings was Hôtel Verneuil, a hotel in Saint-Germain that had collected a motley crew of struggling expatriates, mostly writers. This Verneuil circle spawned numerous friendships that Baldwin relied upon in rough periods. He was also extremely poor during his time in Paris, with only momentary respites from that condition. In his early years in Saint-Germain, he met Otto Friedrich, Mason Hoffenberg, Asa Benveniste, Themistocles Hoetis, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Max Ernst, Truman Capote, and Stephen Spender, among many others. Baldwin also met Lucien Happersberger, a Swiss boy, 17 years old at the time of their first meeting, who came to France in search of excitement. Happersberger and Baldwin began to bond for the next few years, eventually becoming his intimate partner and he became Baldwin&#x27;s near-obsession for some time afterward. Baldwin and Happersberger remained friends for the next thirty-nine years. Even though his time in Paris was not easy, Baldwin escaped from the aspects of American life that outraged him the most—especially the &quot;daily indignities of racism.&quot; According to one biographer: &quot;Baldwin seemed at ease in his Paris life; Jimmy Baldwin the aesthete and lover reveled in the Saint-Germain ambiance.&quot;

During his early years in Paris, prior to the publication of &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; in 1953, Baldwin wrote several notable works. &quot;The Negro in Paris&quot;, first published in &quot;The Reporter&quot;, explored Baldwin&#x27;s perception of an incompatibility between Black Americans and Black Africans in Paris, because Black Americans had faced a &quot;depthless alienation from oneself and one&#x27;s people&quot; that was mostly unknown to Parisian Africans. He also wrote &quot;The Preservation of Innocence&quot;, which traced the violence against homosexuals in American life back to the protracted adolescence of America as a society. In the magazine &quot;Commentary&quot;, he published &quot;Too Little, Too Late&quot;, an essay about Black American literature, and he also published &quot;The Death of the Prophet&quot;, a short story that grew out of Baldwin&#x27;s earlier writings of &quot;Go Tell It on The Mountain&quot;. In the latter work, Baldwin employs a character named Johnnie to trace his bouts of depression back to his inability to resolve the questions of filial intimacy raised by his relationship with his stepfather. In December 1949, Baldwin was arrested and jailed for receiving stolen goods after an American friend brought him bedsheets that the friend had taken from another Paris hotel. When the charges were dismissed several days later, to the laughter of the courtroom, Baldwin wrote of the experience in his essay &quot;Equal in Paris&quot;, also published in &quot;Commentary&quot; in 1950. In the essay, he expressed his surprise and his bewilderment at how he was no longer a &quot;despised black man&quot;, instead, he was simply an American, no different from the white American friend who stole the sheet and was arrested with him.

During his Paris years, Baldwin also published two of his three scathing critiques of Richard Wright—&quot;Everybody&#x27;s Protest Novel&quot; in 1949 and &quot;Many Thousands Gone&quot; in 1951. Baldwin criticizes Wright&#x27;s work for being protest literature, which Baldwin despised because it is &quot;concerned with theories and with the categorization of human beings, and however brilliant the theories or accurate the categorizations, they fail because they deny life.&quot; Protest writing cages humanity, but, according to Baldwin, &quot;only within this web of ambiguity, paradox, this hunger, danger, darkness, can we find at once ourselves and the power that will free us from ourselves.&quot; Baldwin took Wright&#x27;s &quot;Native Son&quot; and Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, both erstwhile favorites of Baldwin&#x27;s, as paradigmatic analysis examples of the protest novel&#x27;s problem. The treatment of Wright&#x27;s character Bigger Thomas by socially earnest white people near the end of &quot;Native Son&quot; was, for Baldwin, emblematic of white Americans&#x27; presumption that for Black people &quot;to become truly human and acceptable, [they] must first become like us. This assumption once accepted, the Negro in America can only acquiesce in the obliteration of his own personality.&quot; In these two essays, Baldwin came to articulate what would become a theme of his work: that white racism toward Black Americans was refracted through self-hatred and self-denial—&quot;One may say that the Negro in America does not really exist except in the darkness of [white] minds. [...] Our dehumanization of the Negro then is indivisible from our dehumanization of ourselves.&quot; Baldwin&#x27;s relationship with Wright was tense but cordial after the essays, although Baldwin eventually ceased to regard Wright as a mentor. Meanwhile, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Protest Novel&quot; had earned Baldwin the label &quot;the most promising young Negro writer since Richard Wright.&quot;

Beginning in the winter of 1951, Baldwin and Happersberger took several trips to Loèches-les-Bains in Switzerland, where Happersberger&#x27;s family owned a small chateau. By the time of the first trip, Happersberger had then entered a heterosexual relationship but grew worried for his friend Baldwin and offered to take Baldwin to the Swiss village. Baldwin&#x27;s time in the village gave form to his essay &quot;Stranger in the Village&quot;, published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in October 1953. In that essay, Baldwin described some unintentional mistreatment and offputting experiences at the hands of Swiss villagers who possessed a racial innocence which few Americans could attest to. Baldwin explored how the bitter history which was shared by Black and white Americans had formed an indissoluble web of relations that changed the members of both races: &quot;No road whatever will lead Americans back to the simplicity of this European village where white men still have the luxury of looking on me as a stranger.&quot;
Beauford Delaney&#x27;s arrival in France in 1953 marked &quot;the most important personal event in Baldwin&#x27;s life&quot; that year. Around the same time, Baldwin&#x27;s circle of friends shifted away from primarily white bohemians toward a coterie of Black American expatriates: Baldwin grew close to dancer Bernard Hassell; spent significant amounts of time at Gordon Heath&#x27;s club in Paris; regularly listened to Bobby Short and Inez Cavanaugh&#x27;s performances at their respective haunts around the city; met Maya Angelou during her European tour of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;; and occasionally met with writers Richard Gibson and Chester Himes, composer Howard Swanson, and even Richard Wright. In 1954, Baldwin accepted a fellowship at the MacDowell writer&#x27;s colony in New Hampshire to support the writing of a new novel and he also won a Guggenheim Fellowship. Also in 1954, Baldwin published the three-act play &quot;The Amen Corner&quot; which features the preacher Sister Margaret—a fictionalized Mother Horn from Baldwin&#x27;s time at Fireside Pentecostal—who struggles with a difficult inheritance and with alienation from herself and her loved ones on account of her religious fervor. Baldwin spent several weeks in Washington, D.C., and particularly around Howard University while he collaborated with Owen Dodson for the premiere of &quot;The Amen Corner.&quot; Baldwin returned to Paris in October 1955.

Baldwin decided that he would return to the United States in 1957, so in early 1956, he decided to enjoy what was to be his last year in France. He became friends with Norman and Adele Mailer, was recognized by the National Institute of Arts and Letters with a grant, and he was set to publish &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot;. Nevertheless, Baldwin sank deeper into an emotional wreckage. In the summer of 1956—after a seemingly failed affair with a Black musician named Arnold, Baldwin&#x27;s first serious relationship since Happersberger—Baldwin overdosed on sleeping pills during a suicide attempt. He regretted the attempt almost instantly and he called a friend who had him regurgitate the pills before the doctor arrived. Baldwin went on to attend the Congress of Black Writers and Artists in September 1956, a conference which he found disappointing in its perverse reliance on European themes while nonetheless purporting to extol African originality.

==== Literary career ====
Baldwin&#x27;s first published work, a review of the writer Maxim Gorky, appeared in &quot;The Nation&quot; in 1947. He continued to publish there at various times in his career and was serving on its editorial board at the time of his death in 1987.

=== 1950s ===
In 1953, Baldwin published his first novel, &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot;, a semi-autobiographical &quot;bildungsroman&quot;. He began writing it when he was 17 and first published it in Paris. His first collection of essays, &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot; appeared two years later. He continued to experiment with literary forms throughout his career, publishing poetry and plays as well as the fiction and essays for which he was known.

Baldwin&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot;, caused great controversy when it was first published in 1956 due to its explicit homoerotic content. Baldwin again resisted labels with the publication of this work. Despite the reading public&#x27;s expectations that he would publish works dealing with African-American experiences, &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot; is predominantly about white characters.

==== &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; (1953) ====

Baldwin sent the manuscript for &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; from Paris to New York publishing house Alfred A. Knopf on February 26, 1952, and Knopf expressed interest in the novel several months later. To settle the terms of his association with Knopf, Baldwin sailed back to the United States in April 1952 on the SS &quot;Île de France&quot;, where Themistocles Hoetis and Dizzy Gillespie were coincidentally also voyaging—his conversations with both on the ship were extensive. After his arrival in New York, Baldwin spent much of the next three months with his family, whom he had not seen in almost three years. Baldwin grew particularly close to his younger brother, David Jr., and served as best man at David&#x27;s wedding on June 27. Meanwhile, Baldwin agreed to rewrite parts of &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; in exchange for a $250 advance ($ today) and a further $750 ($ today) paid when the final manuscript was completed. When Knopf accepted the revision in July, they sent the remainder of the advance, and Baldwin was soon to have his first published novel. In the interim, Baldwin published excerpts of the novel in two publications: one excerpt was published as &quot;Exodus&quot; in &quot;American Mercury&quot; and the other as &quot;Roy&#x27;s Wound&quot; in &quot;New World Writing&quot;. Baldwin set sail back to Europe on August 28 and &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; was published in May 1953.

&quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; was the product of years of work and exploratory writing since his first attempt at a novel in 1938. In rejecting the ideological manacles of protest literature and the presupposition he thought inherent to such works that &quot;in Negro life there exists no tradition, no field of manners, no possibility of ritual or intercourse&quot;, Baldwin sought in &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; to emphasize that the core of the problem was &quot;not that the Negro has no tradition but that there has as yet arrived no sensibility sufficiently profound and tough to make this tradition articulate.&quot; Baldwin biographer David Leeming draws parallels between &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; and James Joyce&#x27;s 1916 &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot;: to &quot;encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.&quot; Baldwin himself drew parallels between Joyce&#x27;s flight from his native Ireland and his own run from Harlem, and Baldwin read Joyce&#x27;s tome in Paris in 1950, however, in Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot;, it would be the Black American &quot;uncreated conscience&quot; at the heart of the project.

The novel is a bildungsroman that explores the inward struggles of protagonist John Grimes, the illegitimate son of Elizabeth Grimes, to claim his own soul as it lies on the &quot;threshing floor&quot;—a clear allusion to another John: the Baptist, born of another Elizabeth. John&#x27;s struggle is a metaphor for Baldwin&#x27;s own struggle between escaping the history and heritage that made him, awful though it may be, and plunging deeper into that heritage, to the bottom of his people&#x27;s sorrows, before he can shrug off his psychic chains, &quot;climb the mountain&quot;, and free himself. John&#x27;s family members and most of the characters in the novel are blown north in the winds of the Great Migration in search of the American Dream and all are stifled. Florence, Elizabeth, and Gabriel are denied love&#x27;s reach because racism assured that they could not muster the kind of self-respect that love requires. Racism drives Elizabeth&#x27;s lover, Richard, to suicide—Richard will not be the last Baldwin character to die thus for that same reason. Florence&#x27;s lover Frank is destroyed by searing self-hatred of his own Blackness. Gabriel&#x27;s abuse of the women in his life is downstream from his society&#x27;s emasculation of him, with mealy-mouthed religiosity only a hypocritical cover.

The phrase &quot;in my father&#x27;s house&quot; and various similar formulations appear throughout &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain&quot; and was even an early title for the novel. The house is a metaphor at several levels of generality: for his own family&#x27;s apartment in Harlem, for Harlem taken as a whole, for America and its history, and for the &quot;deep heart&#x27;s core&quot;. John&#x27;s departure from the agony that reigned in his father&#x27;s house, particularly the historical sources of the family&#x27;s privations, came through a conversion experience. &quot;Who are these? Who are they?&quot; John cries out when he sees a mass of faces as he descends to the threshing floor: &#x27;They were the despised and rejected, the wretched and the spat upon, the earth&#x27;s offscouring; and he was in their company, and they would swallow up his soul.&quot; John wants desperately to escape the threshing floor, but &quot;[t]hen John saw the Lord&quot; and &quot;a sweetness&quot; filled him. The midwife of John&#x27;s conversion is Elisha, the voice of love that had followed him throughout the experience, and whose body filled John with &quot;a wild delight&quot;. Thus comes the wisdom that would define Baldwin&#x27;s philosophy: per biographer David Leeming: &quot;salvation from the chains and fetters—the self-hatred and the other effects—of historical racism could come only from love.&quot;

==== &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot; (1955) ====

Baldwin&#x27;s friend from high school, Sol Stein, encouraged Baldwin to publish an essay collection reflecting on his work thus far. Originally, Baldwin was reluctant, saying he was &quot;too young to publish my memoirs.&quot; but he nevertheless produced a collection, &quot;Notes of a Native Son,&quot; that was published in 1955. The book contained practically all of the major themes that run through his work: searching for self when racial myths cloud reality; accepting an inheritance (&quot;the conundrum of color is the inheritance of every American&quot;); claiming a birthright (&quot;my birthright was vast, connecting me to all that lives, and to everyone, forever&quot;); the artist&#x27;s loneliness; love&#x27;s urgency. All the essays in &quot;Notes&quot; were published between 1948 and 1955 in &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;The New Leader&quot;, &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, &quot;The Reporter&quot;, and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The essays rely on autobiographical detail to convey Baldwin&#x27;s arguments, as all of Baldwin&#x27;s work does. &quot;Notes&quot; was Baldwin&#x27;s first introduction to many white Americans and it became their reference point for his work: Baldwin was often asked: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you write more essays like the ones in &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot;?&quot; The collection&#x27;s title alludes to both Richard Wright&#x27;s &quot;Native Son&quot; and the work of one of Baldwin&#x27;s favorite writers, Henry James&#x27;s &quot;Notes of a Son and Brother&quot;.

&quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot; is divided into three parts: the first part deals with Black identity as artist and human; the second part addresses Black life in America, including what is sometimes considered Baldwin&#x27;s best essay, the titular &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot;; the final part takes the expatriate&#x27;s perspective, looking at American society from beyond its shores. Part One of &quot;Notes&quot; features &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Protest Novel&quot; and &quot;Many Thousands Gone&quot;, along with &quot;Carmen Jones: The Dark Is Light Enough&quot;, a 1955 review of &quot;Carmen Jones&quot; written for &quot;Commentary&quot;, in which Baldwin at once extols the sight of an all-Black cast on the silver screen and laments the film&#x27;s myths about Black sexuality. Part Two reprints &quot;The Harlem Ghetto&quot; and &quot;Journey to Atlanta&quot; as prefaces for &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot;. In &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot;, Baldwin attempts to come to terms with his racial and filial inheritances. Part Three contains &quot;Equal in Paris&quot;, &quot;Stranger in the Village&quot;, &quot;Encounter on the Seine&quot;, and &quot;A Question of Identity&quot;. Writing from the expatriate&#x27;s perspective, Part Three is the sector of Baldwin&#x27;s corpus that most closely mirrors Henry James&#x27;s methods: hewing out of one&#x27;s distance and detachment from the homeland a coherent idea of what it means to be American.

Throughout &quot;Notes&quot;, when Baldwin is not speaking in first-person, Baldwin takes the view of white Americans. For example, in &quot;The Harlem Ghetto&quot;, Baldwin writes: &quot;what it means to be a Negro in America can perhaps be suggested by the myths we perpetuate about him.&quot; This earned some quantity of scorn from reviewers: in a review for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Langston Hughes lamented that &quot;Baldwin&#x27;s viewpoints are half American, half Afro-American, incompletely fused.&quot; Others were nonplussed by the handholding of white audiences, which Baldwin himself would criticize in later works. Nonetheless, most acutely in this stage in his career, Baldwin wanted to escape the rigid categories of protest literature and he viewed adopting a white point-of-view as a good method of doing so.

==== &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot; (1956) ====

Shortly after returning to Paris in 1956, Baldwin got word from Dial Press that &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot; had been accepted for publication. The book was published that autumn.

In the novel, the protagonist David is in Paris while his fiancée Hella is in Spain. David meets the titular Giovanni at a bar; the two grow increasingly intimate and David eventually finds his way to Giovanni&#x27;s room. David is confused by his intense feelings for Giovanni and has sex with a woman in the spur of the moment to reaffirm his heterosexuality. Meanwhile, Giovanni begins to prostitute himself and finally commits a murder for which he is guillotined. David&#x27;s tale is one of love&#x27;s inhibition: he cannot &quot;face love when he finds it&quot;, writes biographer James Campbell. The novel features a traditional theme: the clash between the constraints of puritanism and the impulse for adventure and the subsequent loss of innocence that results.

The inspiration for the murder in the novel&#x27;s plot is an event dating from 1943 to 1944. A Columbia University undergraduate named Lucien Carr murdered an older, homosexual man, David Kammerer, who made sexual advances on Carr. The two were walking near the banks of the Hudson River when Kammerer made a pass at Carr, leading Carr to stab Kammerer and dump Kammerer&#x27;s body in the river. To Baldwin&#x27;s relief, the reviews of &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot; were positive, and his family did not criticize the subject matter.

===Return to New York===
Even from Paris, Baldwin was able to follow the emergence of the Civil Rights Movement in his homeland. In May 1954, the United States Supreme Court ordered schools to desegregate &quot;with all deliberate speed&quot;; in August 1955 the racist murder of Emmett Till in Money, Mississippi, and the subsequent acquittal of his killers were etched in Baldwin&#x27;s mind until he wrote &quot;Blues for Mister Charlie&quot;; in December 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus; and in February 1956 Autherine Lucy was admitted to the University of Alabama before being expelled when whites rioted. Meanwhile, Baldwin was increasingly burdened by the sense that he was wasting time in Paris. Baldwin began planning a return to the United States in hopes of writing a biography of Booker T. Washington, which he then called &quot;Talking at the Gates&quot;. Baldwin also received commissions to write a review of Daniel Guérin&#x27;s &quot;Negroes on the March&quot; and J. C. Furnas&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye to Uncle Tom&quot; for &quot;The Nation&quot;, as well as to write about William Faulkner and American racism for the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;.

The first project became &quot;The Crusade of Indignation&quot;, published in July 1956. In it, Baldwin suggests that the portrait of Black life in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; &quot;has set the tone for the attitude of American whites towards Negroes for the last one hundred years&quot;, and that, given the novel&#x27;s popularity, this portrait has led to a unidimensional characterization of Black Americans that does not capture the full scope of Black humanity. The second project turned into the essay &quot;William Faulkner and Desegregation&quot;. The essay was inspired by Faulkner&#x27;s March 1956 comment during an interview that he was sure to enlist himself with his fellow white Mississippians in a war over desegregation &quot;even if it meant going out into the streets and shooting Negroes&quot;. For Baldwin, Faulkner represented the &quot;go slow&quot; mentality on desegregation that tries to wrestle with the Southerner&#x27;s peculiar dilemma: the South &quot;clings to two entirely antithetical doctrines, two legends, two histories&quot;; the southerner is &quot;the proud citizen of a free society and, on the other hand, committed to a society that has not yet dared to free itself of the necessity of naked and brutal oppression.&quot; Faulkner asks for more time but &quot;the time [...] does not exist. [...] There is never time in the future in which we will work out our salvation.&quot;

Baldwin initially intended to complete &quot;Another Country&quot; before returning to New York in the fall of 1957, but progress on the novel was slow, so he decided to go back to the United States sooner. Beauford Delaney was particularly upset by Baldwin&#x27;s departure. Delaney had started to drink heavily and entered the incipient stages of mental deterioration, including complaining about hearing voices. Nonetheless, after a brief visit with Édith Piaf, Baldwin set sail for New York in July 1957.

=== 1960s ===
Baldwin&#x27;s third and fourth novels, &quot;Another Country&quot; (1962) and &quot;Tell Me How Long the Train&#x27;s Been Gone&quot; (1968), are sprawling, experimental works dealing with Black and white characters, as well as with heterosexual, gay, and bisexual characters. Baldwin completed &quot;Another Country&quot; during his first, two-month stay in Istanbul (which ends with the note, Istanbul, Dec. 10, 1961). This was to be the first of many stays in Istanbul during the 1960s.

Baldwin&#x27;s lengthy essay &quot;Down at the Cross&quot; (frequently called &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot; after the title of the 1963 book in which it was published) similarly showed the seething discontent of the 1960s in novel form. The essay was originally published in two oversized issues of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and landed Baldwin on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1963 while he was touring the South speaking about the restive Civil Rights Movement. Around the time of publication of &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot;, Baldwin became a known spokesperson for civil rights and a celebrity noted for championing the cause of Black Americans. He frequently appeared on television and delivered speeches on college campuses. The essay talked about the uneasy relationship between Christianity and the burgeoning Black Muslim movement. After publication, several Black nationalists criticized Baldwin for his conciliatory attitude. They questioned whether his message of love and understanding would do much to change race relations in America. The book was consumed by whites looking for answers to the question: What do Black Americans really want? Baldwin&#x27;s essays never stopped articulating the anger and frustration felt by real-life Black Americans with more clarity and style than any other writer of his generation.

In 1965, Baldwin participated in a much publicized debate with William F. Buckley, on the topic of whether the American dream had been achieved at the expense of African Americans. The debate took place in the UK at the Cambridge Union, historic debating society of the University of Cambridge. The spectating student body voted overwhelmingly in Baldwin&#x27;s favor.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
Baldwin&#x27;s next book-length essay, &quot;No Name in the Street&quot; (1972), also discussed his own experience in the context of the later 1960s, specifically the assassinations of three of his personal friends: Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King Jr.

Baldwin&#x27;s writings of the 1970s and 1980s were largely overlooked by critics, although they have received increasing attention in recent years. Several of his essays and interviews of the 1980s discuss homosexuality and homophobia with fervor and forthrightness. Eldridge Cleaver&#x27;s harsh criticism of Baldwin in &quot;Soul on Ice&quot; and elsewhere and Baldwin&#x27;s return to southern France contributed to the perception by critics that he was not in touch with his readership. As he had been the leading literary voice of the civil rights movement, he became an inspirational figure for the emerging gay rights movement. His two novels written in the 1970s, &quot;If Beale Street Could Talk&quot; (1974) and &quot;Just Above My Head&quot; (1979), stressed the importance of Black American families. He concluded his career by publishing a volume of poetry, &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1983), as well as another book-length essay, &quot;The Evidence of Things Not Seen&quot; (1985), an extended reflection on race inspired by the Atlanta murders of 1979–1981.

=== Saint-Paul-de-Vence ===
Baldwin lived in France for most of his later life, using it as a base of operations for extensive international travel. Baldwin settled in Saint-Paul-de-Vence in the south of France in 1970, in an old Provençal house beneath the ramparts of the famous village. His house was always open to his friends, who frequently visited him while on trips to the French Riviera. American painter Beauford Delaney made Baldwin&#x27;s house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence his second home, often setting up his easel in the garden. Delaney painted several colorful portraits of Baldwin. Fred Nall Hollis also befriended Baldwin during this time. Actors Harry Belafonte and Sidney Poitier were also regular guests.

Many of Baldwin&#x27;s musician friends dropped in during the Jazz à Juan and Nice Jazz Festivals. They included Nina Simone, Josephine Baker (whose sister lived in Nice), Miles Davis, and Ray Charles. In his autobiography, Miles Davis wrote:

I&#x27;d read his books and I liked and respected what he had to say. As I got to know Jimmy we opened up to each other and became real great friends. Every time I went to southern France to play Antibes, I would always spend a day or two out at Jimmy&#x27;s house in St. Paul de Vence. We&#x27;d just sit there in that great big beautiful house of his telling us all kinds of stories, lying our asses off... He was a great man.

Baldwin learned to speak French fluently and developed friendships with French actor Yves Montand and French writer Marguerite Yourcenar, who translated Baldwin&#x27;s play &quot;The Amen Corner&quot; into French.

Baldwin spent 17 years, until his death in 1987, in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, in the south-east between Nice and Cannes. The years he spent there were also years of work. Sitting in front of his sturdy typewriter, he devoted his days to writing and to answering the huge amount of mail he received from all over the world. He wrote several of his last works in his house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, including &quot;Just Above My Head&quot; in 1979 and &quot;Evidence of Things Not Seen&quot; in 1985. It was also in Saint-Paul-de-Vence that Baldwin wrote his famous &quot;Open Letter to My Sister, Angela Y. Davis&quot; in November 1970.

His last novel, &quot;Harlem Quartet&quot;, was published in 1987.

==Death==

On December 1, 1987, Baldwin died from stomach cancer in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France. He was buried at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, near New York City.

Fred Nall Hollis took care of Baldwin on his deathbed. Nall had been friends with Baldwin from the early 1970s when Baldwin would buy him drinks at the Café de Flore. Nall recalled talking to Baldwin shortly before his death about racism in Alabama. In one conversation, Nall told Baldwin &quot;Through your books you liberated me from my guilt about being so bigoted coming from Alabama and because of my homosexuality.&quot; Baldwin insisted: &quot;No, you liberated me in revealing this to me.&quot;

A few hours after his death, his novel &quot;Harlem Quartet&quot;, published earlier in the year, won the French-American Friendship Prize (having a week earlier lost out by one vote in Paris for the Prix Femina awarded to the best foreign novel of the year).

At the time of Baldwin&#x27;s death, he was working on an unfinished manuscript called &quot;Remember This House&quot;, a memoir of his personal recollections of civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Following his death, publishing company McGraw-Hill took the unprecedented step of suing his estate to recover the $200,000 advance they had paid him for the book, although the lawsuit was dropped by 1990. The manuscript forms the basis for Raoul Peck&#x27;s 2016 documentary film &quot;I Am Not Your Negro&quot;.

Following Baldwin&#x27;s death, a court battle was waged over the ownership of his home in France. Baldwin had been in the process of purchasing his house from his landlady, Jeanne Faure. At the time of his death, Baldwin did not have full ownership of the home, and it was Mlle. Faure&#x27;s intention that the home would stay in her family. His home, nicknamed &quot;Chez Baldwin&quot;, has been the center of scholarly work and artistic and political activism. The National Museum of African American History and Culture has an online exhibit titled &quot;Chez Baldwin&quot;, which uses his historic French home as a lens to explore his life and legacy. Magdalena J. Zaborowska&#x27;s 2018 book, &quot;Me and My House: James Baldwin&#x27;s Last Decade in France&quot;, uses photographs of his home and his collections to discuss themes of politics, race, queerness, and domesticity.

Over the years, several efforts were initiated to save the house and convert it into an artist residency. None had the endorsement of the Baldwin estate. In February 2016, published an opinion piece by Thomas Chatterton Williams, a contemporary Black American expatriate writer in France, which spurred a group of activists to come together in Paris. In June 2016, American writer and activist Shannon Cain squatted at the house for 10 days in an act of political and artistic protest. Les Amis de la Maison Baldwin, a French organization whose initial goal was to purchase the house by launching a capital campaign funded by the U.S. philanthropic sector, grew out of this effort. This campaign was unsuccessful without the support of the Baldwin Estate. Attempts to engage the French government in conservation of the property were dismissed by the mayor of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, Joseph Le Chapelain, whose statement to the local press claiming &quot;nobody&#x27;s ever heard of James Baldwin&quot; mirrored that of Henri Chambon, the owner of the corporation that razed the house. Construction was completed in 2019 on the apartment complex that now stands where Chez Baldwin once stood.

==Themes==
===Struggle for self===
In all of Baldwin&#x27;s works, but particularly in his novels, the main characters are twined up in a &quot;cage of reality&quot; that sees them fighting for their soul against the limitations of the human condition or against their place at the margins of a society consumed by various prejudices. Baldwin connects many of his main characters—John in &quot;Go Tell It On The Mountain&quot;, Rufus in &quot;Another Country&quot;, Richard in &quot;Blues for Mister Charlie&quot;, and Giovanni in &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot;—as sharing a reality of restriction: per biographer David Leeming, each is &quot;a symbolic cadaver in the center of the world depicted in the given novel and the larger society symbolized by that world&quot;. Each reaches for an identity within their own social environment, and sometimes—as in &quot;If Beale Street Could Talk&quot;″s Fonny and &quot;Tell me How Long The Train&#x27;s Been Gone&quot;″s Leo—they find such an identity, imperfect but sufficient to bear the world. The singular theme in the attempts of Baldwin&#x27;s characters to resolve their struggle for themselves is that such resolution only comes through love. Here is Leeming at some length:
== Social and political activism ==
Baldwin returned to the United States in the summer of 1957, while the civil rights legislation of that year was being debated in Congress. He had been powerfully moved by the image of a young girl, Dorothy Counts, braving a mob in an attempt to desegregate schools in Charlotte, North Carolina, and &quot;Partisan Review&quot; editor Philip Rahv had suggested he report on what was happening in the American South. Baldwin was nervous about the trip but he made it, interviewing people in Charlotte (where he met Martin Luther King Jr.), and Montgomery, Alabama. The result was two essays, one published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine (&quot;The Hard Kind of Courage&quot;), the other in &quot;Partisan Review&quot; (&quot;Nobody Knows My Name&quot;). Subsequent Baldwin articles on the movement appeared in &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; where in 1962 he published the essay that he called &quot;Down at the Cross&quot;, and the &quot;New Yorker&quot; called &quot;Letter from a Region of My Mind&quot;. Along with a shorter essay from &quot;The Progressive&quot;, the essay became &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot;.

While he wrote about the movement, Baldwin aligned himself with the ideals of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Joining CORE allowed him to travel across the South, lecturing on racial inequality. His insights into both the North and South gave him a unique perspective on the racial problems the United States was facing.

In 1963 he conducted a lecture tour of the South for CORE, traveling to Durham and Greensboro in North Carolina, and New Orleans. During the tour, he lectured to students, white liberals, and anyone else listening about his racial ideology, an ideological position between the &quot;muscular approach&quot; of Malcolm X and the nonviolent program of Martin Luther King Jr. Baldwin expressed the hope that socialism would take root in the United States:

It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have.
:—James Baldwin

By the spring of 1963, the mainstream press began to recognize Baldwin&#x27;s incisive analysis of white racism and his eloquent descriptions of the Negro&#x27;s pain and frustration. In fact, &quot;Time&quot; featured Baldwin on the cover of its May 17, 1963, issue. &quot;There is not another writer&quot;, said &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;who expresses with such poignancy and abrasiveness the dark realities of the racial ferment in North and South.&quot;

In a cable Baldwin sent to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy during the Birmingham riot of 1963, Baldwin blamed the violence in Birmingham on the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, Mississippi Senator James Eastland, and President Kennedy for failing to use &quot;the great prestige of his office as the moral forum which it can be.&quot; Attorney General Kennedy invited Baldwin to meet with him over breakfast, and that meeting was followed up with a second, when Kennedy met with Baldwin and others Baldwin had invited to Kennedy&#x27;s Manhattan apartment. This meeting is discussed in Howard Simon&#x27;s 1999 play, &quot;James Baldwin: A Soul on Fire&quot;. The delegation included Kenneth B. Clark, a psychologist who had played a key role in the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision; actor Harry Belafonte, singer Lena Horne, writer Lorraine Hansberry, and activists from civil rights organizations. Although most of the attendees of this meeting left feeling &quot;devastated&quot;, the meeting was an important one in voicing the concerns of the civil rights movement, and it provided exposure of the civil rights issue not just as a political issue but also as a moral issue.

James Baldwin&#x27;s FBI file contains 1,884 pages, collected from 1960 until the early 1970s. During that era of surveillance of American writers, the FBI accumulated 276 pages on Richard Wright, 110 pages on Truman Capote, and just nine pages on Henry Miller.

Baldwin also made a prominent appearance at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, with Belafonte and long-time friends Sidney Poitier and Marlon Brando.

Baldwin&#x27;s sexuality clashed with his activism. The civil rights movement was hostile to homosexuals. The only overtly gay men in the movement were Baldwin and Bayard Rustin. Rustin and King were very close, as Rustin received credit for the success of the March on Washington. Many were bothered by Rustin&#x27;s sexual orientation. King himself spoke on the topic of sexual orientation in a school editorial column during his college years, and in reply to a letter during the 1950s, where he treated it as a mental illness which an individual could overcome. King&#x27;s key advisor, Stanley Levison, also stated that Baldwin and Rustin were &quot;better qualified to lead a homo-sexual movement than a civil rights movement&quot;. The pressure later resulted in King distancing himself from both men. Despite his enormous efforts within the movement, Baldwin was excluded from the inner circles of the civil rights movement because of his sexuality and was conspicuously not invited to speak at the March on Washington.

At the time, Baldwin was neither in the closet nor open to the public about his sexual orientation. Although his novels, specifically &quot;Giovanni&#x27;s Room&quot; and &quot;Just Above My Head&quot;, had openly gay characters and relationships, Baldwin himself never openly described his sexuality. In his book, Kevin Mumford points out how Baldwin went his life &quot;passing as straight rather than confronting homophobes with whom he mobilized against racism&quot;.

When the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing happened in Birmingham three weeks after the March on Washington, Baldwin called for a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience in response to this &quot;terrifying crisis&quot;. He traveled to Selma, Alabama, where SNCC had organized a voter registration drive; he watched mothers with babies and elderly men and women standing in long lines for hours, as armed deputies and state troopers stood by—or intervened to smash a reporter&#x27;s camera or use cattle prods on SNCC workers. After his day of watching, he spoke in a crowded church, blaming Washington—&quot;the good white people on the hill&quot;. Returning to Washington, he told a &quot;New York Post&quot; reporter the federal government could protect Negroes—it could send federal troops into the South. He blamed the Kennedys for not acting. In March 1965, Baldwin joined marchers who walked 50 miles from Selma, Alabama (Selma to Montgomery Marches), to the capitol in Montgomery under the protection of federal troops.

Nonetheless, he rejected the label &quot;civil rights activist&quot;, or that he had participated in a civil rights movement, instead agreeing with Malcolm X&#x27;s assertion that if one is a citizen, one should not have to fight for one&#x27;s civil rights. In a 1964 interview with Robert Penn Warren for the book &quot;Who Speaks for the Negro?&quot;, Baldwin rejected the idea that the civil rights movement was an outright revolution, instead calling it &quot;a very peculiar revolution because it has to... have its aims the establishment of a union, and a... radical shift in the American mores, the American way of life... not only as it applies to the Negro obviously, but as it applies to every citizen of the country.&quot; In a 1979 speech at UC Berkeley, Baldwin called it, instead, &quot;the latest slave rebellion&quot;.

In 1968, Baldwin signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse to make income tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. He was also a supporter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which prompted the FBI to create a file on Baldwin.

==Inspiration and relationships==

A great influence on Baldwin was the painter Beauford Delaney. In &quot;The Price of the Ticket&quot; (1985), Baldwin describes Delaney as:

... the first living proof, for me, that a black man could be an artist. In a warmer time, a less blasphemous place, he would have been recognized as my teacher and I as his pupil. He became, for me, an example of courage and integrity, humility and passion. An absolute integrity: I saw him shaken many times and I lived to see him broken but I never saw him bow.

Later support came from Richard Wright, whom Baldwin called &quot;the greatest black writer in the world&quot;. Wright and Baldwin became friends, and Wright helped Baldwin to secure the Eugene F. Saxton Memorial Foundation $500 fellowship. Baldwin&#x27;s essay &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot; and his collection &quot;Notes of a Native Son&quot; allude to Wright&#x27;s 1940 novel &quot;Native Son&quot;. In Baldwin&#x27;s 1949 essay &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Protest Novel&quot;, however, he indicated that &quot;Native Son&quot;, like Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852), lacked credible characters and psychological complexity, and the friendship between the two authors ended. Interviewed by Julius Lester, however, Baldwin explained: &quot;I knew Richard and I loved him. I was not attacking him; I was trying to clarify something for myself.&quot;

In 1949, Baldwin met and fell in love with Lucien Happersberger, a boy aged 17, though Happersberger&#x27;s marriage three years later left Baldwin distraught. When the marriage ended, they later reconciled, with Happersberger staying by Baldwin&#x27;s deathbed at his house in Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Happersberger died on August 21, 2010, in Switzerland.

Baldwin was a close friend of the singer, pianist, and civil rights activist Nina Simone. Langston Hughes, Lorraine Hansberry, and Baldwin helped Simone learn about the Civil Rights Movement. Baldwin also provided her with literary references influential on her later work. Baldwin and Hansberry met with Robert F. Kennedy, along with Kenneth Clark and Lena Horne and others in an attempt to persuade Kennedy of the importance of civil rights legislation.

Baldwin influenced the work of French painter Philippe Derome, whom he met in Paris in the early 1960s. Baldwin also knew Marlon Brando, Charlton Heston, Billy Dee Williams, Huey P. Newton, Nikki Giovanni, Jean-Paul Sartre, Jean Genet (with whom he campaigned on behalf of the Black Panther Party), Lee Strasberg, Elia Kazan, Rip Torn, Alex Haley, Miles Davis, Amiri Baraka, Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothea Tanning, Leonor Fini, Margaret Mead, Josephine Baker, Allen Ginsberg, Chinua Achebe, and Maya Angelou. He wrote at length about his &quot;political relationship&quot; with Malcolm X. He collaborated with childhood friend Richard Avedon on the 1964 book &quot;Nothing Personal&quot;.

Baldwin was fictionalized as the character Marion Dawes in the 1967 novel &quot;The Man Who Cried I Am&quot; by John A. Williams.

Maya Angelou called Baldwin her &quot;friend and brother&quot; and credited him for &quot;setting the stage&quot; for her 1969 autobiography &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;. Baldwin was made a Commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur by the French government in 1986.

Baldwin was also a close friend of Nobel Prize-winning novelist Toni Morrison, who lived for a time in same apartment building in New York. Upon his death, Morrison wrote a eulogy for Baldwin that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In the eulogy, entitled &quot;Life in His Language&quot;, Morrison credits Baldwin as being her literary inspiration and the person who showed her the true potential of writing. She writes:

Although Baldwin and Truman Capote were acquaintances, they were not friends. In fact, Capote berated him several times.

==Legacy and critical response==
Literary critic Harold Bloom characterized Baldwin as being &quot;among the most considerable moral essayists in the United States&quot;. Baldwin&#x27;s influence on other writers has been profound: Toni Morrison edited the Library of America&#x27;s first two volumes of Baldwin&#x27;s fiction and essays: &quot;Early Novels &amp; Stories&quot; (1998) and &quot;Collected Essays&quot; (1998). A third volume, &quot;Later Novels&quot; (2015), was edited by Darryl Pinckney, who delivered a talk on Baldwin in February 2013 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, during which Pinckney said, &quot;No other black writer I&#x27;d read was as literary as Baldwin in his early essays, not even Ralph Ellison. There is something wild in the beauty of Baldwin&#x27;s sentences and the cool of his tone, something improbable, too, this meeting of Henry James, the Bible, and Harlem.&quot; One of Baldwin&#x27;s richest short stories, &quot;Sonny&#x27;s Blues&quot;, appears in many anthologies of short fiction used in introductory college literature classes.
A street in San Francisco, Baldwin Court in the Bayview neighborhood, is named after him. In 1987, Kevin Brown, a photojournalist from Baltimore, founded the National James Baldwin Literary Society. The group organizes free public events celebrating Baldwin&#x27;s life and legacy. In 1992, Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, established the James Baldwin Scholars program, an urban outreach initiative, in honor of Baldwin, who taught at Hampshire in the early 1980s. The JBS Program provides talented students of color from under-served communities an opportunity to develop and improve the skills necessary for college success through coursework and tutorial support for one transitional year, after which Baldwin scholars may apply for full matriculation to Hampshire or any other four-year college program.

Spike Lee&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; includes a Black gay character, played by Isaiah Washington, who punches a homophobic character, saying: &quot;This is for James Baldwin and Langston Hughes.&quot; His name appears in the lyrics of the Le Tigre song &quot;Hot Topic&quot;, released in 1999. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante included James Baldwin on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.
In 2005, the United States Postal Service created a first-class postage stamp dedicated to Baldwin, which featured him on the front with a short biography on the back of the peeling paper. In 2012, Baldwin was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people. In 2014, East 128th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was named &quot;James Baldwin Place&quot; to celebrate the 90th anniversary of Baldwin&#x27;s birth. He lived in the neighborhood and attended P.S. 24. Readings of Baldwin&#x27;s writing were held at The National Black Theatre and a month-long art exhibition featuring works by New York Live Arts and artist Maureen Kelleher. The events were attended by Council Member Inez Dickens, who led the campaign to honor Harlem native&#x27;s son; also taking part were Baldwin&#x27;s family, theatre and film notables, and members of the community.

Also in 2014, Baldwin was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro neighborhood celebrating LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields.&quot; In 2014, The Social Justice Hub at The New School&#x27;s newly opened University Center was named the Baldwin Rivera Boggs Center after activists Baldwin, Sylvia Rivera, and Grace Lee Boggs. In 2016, Raoul Peck released his documentary film &quot;I Am Not Your Negro&quot;. It is based on James Baldwin&#x27;s unfinished manuscript, &quot;Remember This House&quot;. It is a 93-minute journey into Black history that connects the past of the Civil Rights Movement to the present of Black Lives Matter. It is a film that questions Black representation in Hollywood and beyond.

In 2017, Scott Timberg wrote an essay for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; (&quot;30 years after his death, James Baldwin is having a new pop culture moment&quot;) in which he noted existing cultural references to Baldwin, 30 years after his death, and concluded: &quot;So Baldwin is not just a writer for the ages, but a scribe whose work—as squarely as George Orwell&#x27;s—speaks directly to ours.&quot; In June 2019, Baldwin&#x27;s residence on the Upper West Side was given landmark designation by New York City&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Commission, and it was added to the National Register of Historic Places the same year. 

In June 2019, Baldwin was one of the inaugural fifty American &quot;pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes&quot; inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City&#x27;s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall&#x27;s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. At the Paris Council of June 2019, the city of Paris voted unanimously by all political groups to name a place in the capital in honor of James Baldwin. The project was confirmed on June 19, 2019, and announced for the year 2020. In 2021, Paris City Hall announced that the writer&#x27;s name would be given to the first media library in the 19th arrondissement, which is scheduled to open in 2024.

On February 1, 2024, Google celebrated James Baldwin with a Google Doodle. In 2024, he appeared as a character in the television series &quot;&quot;, played by Chris Chalk.

On May 17, 2024, a blue plaque was unveiled by Nubian Jak Community Trust/Black History Walks to honour Baldwin at the site where in 1985 he visited the C. L. R. James Library in the London Borough of Hackney. On August 2, 2024, The New York Public Library&#x27;s Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture opened an exhibition, &quot;JIMMY! God&#x27;s Black Revolutionary Mouth&quot; in honor of the centennial of Baldwin&#x27;s birth. Scheduled to run until February 28, 2025, it is accompanied by a series of public events and an exhibition of some of his manuscripts in a related exhibition &quot;James Baldwin: Mountain to Fire&quot; as part of the Polonsky Exhibition of The New York Public Library&#x27;s Treasures.

<doc id="176943" wikidata="Q1930632" url="?curid=176943" title="Richard Reid">
<text>Richard Colvin Reid (born 12 August 1973), also known as the Shoe Bomber, is a British terrorist, who is known as the perpetrator of the failed shoe bombing attempt against a transatlantic flight in 2001. Born to a father who was a career criminal, Reid converted to Islam as a young man in prison after years as a petty criminal. Later he became radicalized and went to Pakistan and Afghanistan, where he trained and became a member of al-Qaeda.

On 22 December 2001, Reid boarded American Airlines Flight 63 between Paris and Miami, wearing shoes packed with explosives, which he unsuccessfully tried to detonate. Passengers subdued him on the plane, which landed at Logan International Airport in Boston, the closest US airport. He was arrested, charged, and indicted. In 2002, Reid pleaded guilty in US federal court to eight federal criminal counts of terrorism, based on his attempt to destroy a commercial aircraft in flight. He was sentenced to three life terms plus 110 years in prison without parole and was transferred to ADX Florence, a super maximum security prison in Colorado.

==Background==
Reid was born in Bromley, London, to Lesley Hughes, who was of native English descent, and Colvin Robin Reid, a man of mixed race whose father was a Jamaican immigrant. When Reid was born, his father, a career criminal, was in prison for stealing a car. Reid attended Thomas Tallis School in Kidbrooke, leaving at age 16 and becoming a graffiti writer who was in and out of detention. He began writing graffiti under the name &quot;Enrol&quot; as part of a gang, and ultimately accumulated more than 10 convictions for crimes against persons and property. He served sentences at Feltham Young Offenders Institution and at Maidstone Prison.

In 1992, while serving a three-year sentence for various street robberies, he converted to Islam.

==Islamic radicalisation==
Upon his release from prison in 1995, Reid joined the Brixton Mosque. He later began attending the Finsbury Park Mosque in North London, headed at that time by the anti-American cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was described as &quot;the heart of the extremist Islamic culture&quot; in Britain. By 1998 Reid was voicing extremist views. At the Finsbury Park Mosque he fell under the sway of &quot;terrorist talent spotters and handlers&quot; including Djamel Beghal, one of the leaders of the foiled plan for a 2001 suicide bombing of the American Embassy in Paris.

Reid spent 1999 and 2000 in Pakistan and trained at a terrorist camp in Afghanistan, according to several informants. He may also have attended an anti-American religious training centre in Lahore as a follower of Mubarak Ali Gilani.

After his return to Britain, Reid worked to obtain duplicate passports from British government consulates abroad. He lived and travelled in several places in Europe, communicating using an address in Peshawar, Pakistan, coincidentally where al Qaeda was formed in the late 1980s.

==Preparation for bombing==
Reid and Saajid Badat, another British man preparing as a terrorist, returned to Pakistan in November 2001, and reportedly travelled overland to Afghanistan. They were given &quot;shoe bombs&quot;, casual footwear adapted to be covertly smuggled onto aircraft before being used to destroy them. Later forensic analysis of both bombs showed that they contained the same plastic explosive and that the respective lengths of detonator cord had come from the same batch: the cut mark on Badat&#x27;s cord exactly matched that on Reid&#x27;s. The pair returned separately to the United Kingdom in early December 2001. Reid went to Belgium for 10 days before catching a train to Paris on 16 December.

On 21 December 2001, Reid attempted to board a flight from Paris to Miami, Florida. His boarding was delayed because his dishevelled physical appearance aroused the suspicions of the airline passenger screeners. Once questioned by an ICTS agent, he was referred to the French National Police due to his seemingly evasive behavior and lack of baggage. Because his British passport was genuine and his name was not found on any lists of suspected terrorists, the police did not X-ray him or use bomb-sniffing dogs. The extended questioning resulted in Reid missing his flight, so he stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport while American Airlines was allowed to re-issue a ticket. He returned to the airport the following day and boarded American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami, wearing his special shoes packed with plastic explosives in their hollowed-out bottoms.

==Bombing attempt on American Airlines Flight 63==
On 22 December 2001, a passenger on Flight 63 from Paris to Miami complained of the smell of smoke in the cabin shortly after a meal service. One flight attendant, Hermis Moutardier, thinking she smelled a burnt match, walked along the aisles of the plane, trying to find the source. She found Reid, who was sitting alone near a window, attempting to light a match. Moutardier warned him that smoking was not allowed onboard the aircraft. Reid promised to stop.

A few minutes later, Moutardier found Reid leaned over in his seat. After she asked him what he was doing, Reid grabbed her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. Several passengers worked together to subdue the () tall, () Reid. They restrained him using plastic handcuffs, seatbelt extensions, leather waist belts and headphone cords. An off-duty doctor on board administered a tranquilizer to him, which he found in the emergency medical kit of the airliner. The flight was immediately diverted to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, the closest airport in the United States.

The explosive apparently did not detonate due to the delay in the departure of Reid&#x27;s flight. The rainy weather, along with Reid&#x27;s foot perspiration, made the fuse too damp to ignite.

==Legal proceedings and sentencing==

Reid was immediately arrested at Logan International Airport after the incident. Two days later, he was charged before a federal court in Boston with &quot;interfering with the performance of duties of flight crew members by assault or intimidation&quot;, a crime which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Additional charges were added when he was formally indicted by a grand jury. The judge ordered Reid held in jail without bail, pending trial due to the gravity of the crimes and the perceived high risk that he would try to flee. Officials at the time indicated that Reid&#x27;s shoes contained 10 ounces (283 g) of explosive material characteristic of C-4, enough to blow a hole in the fuselage and cause the plane to crash.

During a preliminary hearing on 28 December, an FBI agent testified that forensic analysis had identified the chemicals as PETN, the primary explosive, and TATP (triacetone triperoxide), a chemical needed to detonate the bomb with a fuse and match. The prosecutor obtained a grand jury indictment and on 16 January 2002, Reid was charged with nine criminal counts related to terrorism, namely: 
* Attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction
* Attempted homicide
* Placing or transporting an explosive or incendiary device on an aircraft or public mass transportation vehicle,
* Attempted murder
* Two counts of interference with flight crew members and attendants on an aircraft
* Attempted destruction of an aircraft or public mass transportation vehicle
* Using a destructive device during and in relation to a crime of violence 
* Attempted destruction of an aircraft
* Attempted wrecking of a mass transportation vehicle

The ninth charge, attempted wrecking of a mass transportation vehicle, was dismissed on 11 June 2002, because the Congressional definition of &quot;vehicle&quot; did not include aircraft.

Reid pleaded guilty to the remaining eight counts on 4 October 2002. On 31 January 2003, he was sentenced by Judge William Young to the maximum of three consecutive life sentences and 110 years with no possibility of parole. Reid was also fined the maximum of $250,000 on each count, a total of $2 million.

During the sentencing hearing, Reid said he was an enemy of the United States and in league with al-Qaeda. When Reid said he was a soldier of God under the command of Osama bin Laden, Judge Young responded:

You are not an enemy combatant, you are a terrorist ... You are not a soldier in any army, you are a terrorist. To call you a soldier gives you far too much stature. &quot;[points to U.S. flag]&quot; You see that flag, Mr. Reid? That is the flag of the United States of America. That flag will be here long after you are forgotten.

Reid reportedly demonstrated a lack of remorse and a combative nature during the hearing, and said that &quot;the flag will come down on the day of judgment&quot;. He is serving his sentence at United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, in Colorado, a supermax facility that holds the most dangerous prisoners in the federal system.

==Conspirators==

Although Reid had insisted that he had acted alone and had built the bombs himself, forensic evidence included material from another person. In 2005, a British man, Saajid Badat from Gloucester, admitted that he had conspired with Richard Reid and a Tunisian man (Nizar Trabelsi, who is in prison in Belgium), in a plot to blow up two airliners bound for the United States, using their shoe bombs. Badat has said that he had been instructed to board a flight from Amsterdam to the United States. Badat never boarded and withdrew from his part of the conspiracy. Badat did not warn criminal or aviation authorities about Reid.

Badat confessed immediately after being arrested by the British police. The detonator cord in Badat&#x27;s bomb was found by experts to be an exact match for the cord on Reid&#x27;s bomb, and their explosive chemicals were essentially identical. He had received the bomb-making materials from someone in Afghanistan. Badat was sentenced to 13 years in prison by a British judge and has since been released.

==Changes in airline security procedures==
As a result of these events, some airlines encouraged passengers departing from an airport in the United States to pass through airport security in socks or bare feet while their shoes are scanned for bombs. In 2006, the TSA started requiring all passengers to remove their shoes for screening. Scanners do not find PETN in shoes or strapped to a person. A chemical test is needed. However, even if the X-ray scanners cannot detect all explosives, it is an effective way to see if the shoe has been altered to hold a bomb. 

In 2011, the rules were relaxed to allow children 12 and younger and adults 75 and older to keep their shoes on during security screenings.

==Alleged role in 9/11==
Captured al-Qaeda terrorist conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui stated at his sentencing hearing in 2006 that Reid was a co-conspirator in the September 11 attacks on the United States, and that Moussaoui and Reid had intended to hijack a fifth aircraft and crash it into the White House in Washington, D.C. as part of the attacks that took place that day. Department of Justice investigators and the federal prosecutors were skeptical of Moussaoui&#x27;s claim that Reid was involved in the plot.

==Prison restrictions==
Reid filed a lawsuit challenging the restrictions placed on him in prison which controlled his communications with lawyers and other non-prisoners, limited his access to Muslim clerics, and prevented him from joining in group prayer at the prison. In 2009, Reid went on a hunger strike and was force-fed and hydrated for several weeks. It was unknown whether Reid&#x27;s hunger strike was related to his lawsuit. The Department of Justice, after consulting with its counter-terrorism section, the prosecuting US attorney&#x27;s office, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, allowed Reid&#x27;s prison restrictions to expire in 2009, rather than renewing them, making his lawsuit moot.

<doc id="176945" wikidata="Q492264" url="?curid=176945" title="Film score">
<text>A film score is original music written specifically to accompany a film. The score comprises a number of orchestral, instrumental, or choral pieces called cues, which are timed to begin and end at specific points during the film in order to enhance the dramatic narrative and the emotional impact of the scene in question. Scores are written by one or more composers under the guidance of or in collaboration with the film&#x27;s director or producer and are then most often performed by an ensemble of musicians – usually including an orchestra (most likely a symphony orchestra) or band, instrumental soloists, and choir or vocalists – known as playback singers – and recorded by a sound engineer. The term is less frequently applied to music written for media such as live theatre, television and radio programs, and video games, and said music is typically referred to as either the soundtrack or incidental music.

Film scores encompass an enormous variety of styles of music, depending on the nature of the films they accompany. While the majority of scores are orchestral works rooted in Western classical music, many scores are also influenced by jazz, rock, pop, blues, new-age and ambient music, and a wide range of ethnic and world music styles. Since the 1950s, a growing number of scores have also included electronic elements as part of the score, and many scores written today feature a hybrid of orchestral and electronic instruments.

Since the invention of digital technology and audio sampling, many modern films have been able to rely on digital samples to imitate the sound of acoustic instruments, and many scores are created and performed wholly by the composers themselves, by using music composition software, synthesizers, samplers, and MIDI controllers.

Songs such as pop songs and rock songs are usually not considered part of the film&#x27;s score, although songs do also form part of the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Although some songs, especially in musicals, are based on thematic ideas from the score (or vice versa), scores usually do not have lyrics, except for when sung by choirs or soloists as part of a cue. Similarly, pop songs that are dropped into a specific scene in a film for emphasis or as diegetic music (e.g., a song playing on a character&#x27;s car radio), are not considered part of the score, although the score&#x27;s composer will occasionally write an original pop song based on their themes, such as James Horner&#x27;s &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; from &quot;Titanic&quot;, written for Celine Dion.

==Terminology==
A film score may also be called a background score, background music, film soundtrack, film music, screen composition, screen music, or incidental music.

==Process of creation==

===Spotting===
The composer usually enters the creative process towards the end of filming at around the same time as the film is being edited, although on some occasions the composer is on hand during the entire film shoot, especially when actors are required to perform with or be aware of original diegetic music. The composer is shown an unpolished &quot;rough cut&quot; of the film before the editing is completed and talks to the director or producer about what sort of music is required for the film in terms of style and tone. The director and composer will watch the entire film, taking note of which scenes require original music. During this process, composers will take precise timing notes so that they know how long each cue needs to last, where it begins, where it ends, and of particular moments during a scene with which the music may need to coincide in a specific way. This process is known as &quot;spotting&quot;.

Occasionally, a filmmaker will actually edit their film to fit the flow of music, rather than have the composer edit their score to the final cut. Director Godfrey Reggio edited his films &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; and &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot; based on composer Philip Glass&#x27;s music. Similarly, the relationship between director Sergio Leone and composer Ennio Morricone was such that the finale of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; and the films &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; were edited to Morricone&#x27;s score as the composer had prepared it months before the film&#x27;s production ended.

In another example, the finale of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; was edited to match the music of his long-time collaborator John Williams: as recounted in a companion documentary on the DVD, Spielberg gave Williams complete freedom with the music and asked him to record the cue without pictures; Spielberg then re-edited the scene later to match the music.

In some circumstances, a composer will be asked to write music based on their impressions of the script or storyboards without seeing the film itself and has more freedom to create music without the need to adhere to specific cue lengths or mirror the emotional arc of a particular scene. This approach is usually taken by a director who does not wish to have the music comment specifically on a particular scene or nuance of a film and which can instead be inserted into the film at any point the director wishes during the post-production process. Composer Hans Zimmer was asked to write music in this way in 2010 for director Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;Inception&quot;; composer Gustavo Santaolalla did the same thing when he wrote his Oscar-winning score for &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;.

===Syncing===
When writing music for film, one goal is to sync dramatic events happening on screen with musical events in the score. There are many different methods for syncing music to picture. These include using sequencing software to calculate timings, using mathematic formulas and free timing with reference timings. Composers work using SMPTE timecode for syncing purposes.

When syncing music to picture, generally a leeway of 3–4 frames late or early allows the composer to be extremely accurate. Using a technique called Free Timing, a conductor will use either (a) a stopwatch or studio size stop clock, or (b) watch the film on a screen or video monitor while conducting the musicians to predetermined timings. These are represented visually by vertical lines (streamers) and bursts of light called punches. These are put on the film by the Music Editor at points specified by the composer. In both instances, the timings on the clock or lines scribed on the film have corresponding timings which are also at specific points (beats) in the composer/conductor score.

====Written click track====
A written click track is a method of writing bars of music in consistent time values (e.g. 4 beats in :02⅔ seconds) to establish a constant tempo in lieu of a metronome value (e.g. 88 Bpm). A composer would use a written click if he or she planned to conduct live performers. When using other methods such as a metronome, the conductor has a perfectly spaced audible click playing. This can yield stiff and lifeless performances in slower more expressive cues. A standard BPM value can be converted to a written click where X represents the number of beats per bar and W represents time in seconds by using the following equation:

formula_1

Written clicks are expressed using 1/3 second increments, so the next step is to round the decimal to either 0, 1/3, or 2/3 of a second. The following is an example for 88 BPM:

formula_2

&quot;2.72 rounds to 2.66, so the written click is 4 beats in :02⅔ seconds.&quot;

Once the composer has identified the location in the film with which to sync musically, he or she must determine the musical beat this event occurs on. To find this, conductors use the following equation, where bpm is beats per minute, &quot;sp&quot; is the sync point in real-time (i.e. 33.7 seconds), and B is the beat number in 1/3 increments (i.e. 49⅔).

formula_3

===Writing===
Once the spotting session has been completed and the precise timings of each cue determined, the composer will then work on writing the score. The methods of writing the score vary from composer to composer; some composers prefer to work with a traditional pencil and paper, writing notes by hand on a staff and performing works-in-progress for the director on a piano, while other composers write on computers using sophisticated music composition software such as Digital Performer, Logic Pro, Finale, Cubase, or Pro Tools. Working with software allows composers to create MIDI-based demos of cues, called MIDI mockups, for review by the filmmaker prior to the final orchestral recording.

The length of time a composer has to write the score varies from project to project; depending on the post-production schedule, a composer may have as little as two weeks or as much as three months to write the score. In normal circumstances, the actual writing process usually lasts around six weeks from beginning to end.

The actual material of the score depends on several different variables that factor into how a composer may write - for instance, the emotion the composer is trying to convey, the nature of the character on screen, the scenery and geography of the set, along with multiple more different variables. A composition could consist of different instrumentations, varying genres, and different influential styles. 

Each composer has his or her own inspirations and pragmatic impressions that create unique and compelling sounds that can help to make a scene memorable. One example of this is in the &quot;Lord of The Rings&quot; score where Howard Shore uses a specific melodic idea to refer to The Shire by employing a tin flute to evoke a Celtic feeling. Shore does this throughout the three films of the trilogy to underscore a character&#x27;s feeling of nostalgic reminiscence (Lawson, Macdonald, 2018).

Other scores include not only original orchestrations but also popular music that represents the era and or the character being portrayed. Many films do this, such as &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; or &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Alan Silvestri at times orchestrates compositions that are accompanied by tracks such as &quot;The Power of Love&quot; and &quot;Back in Time&quot;, both by Huey Lewis and The News. This creates a sense of lightness that deviates from the fanfare-like main theme.(Lawson, Macdonald,2018). 

Many scores often try to draw from worldly influence to create sound that cements itself into popular culture. An example of this would be the score from &quot;The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly&quot;. In this score, composer Ennio Morricone uses a culmination of post-tonal music theory, Celtic song, gregorian chant, and mariachi trumpets to create the sound of the spaghetti western, one that is often associated with the wild west (Kalinak 2010).

===Orchestration===
Once the music has been written, it must then be arranged or orchestrated in order for the ensemble to be able to perform it. The nature and level of orchestration varies from project to project and composer to composer, but in its basic form the orchestrator&#x27;s job is to take the single-line music written by the composer and &quot;flesh it out&quot; into instrument-specific sheet music for each member of the orchestra to perform.
Some composers like Ennio Morricone orchestrate their own scores themselves, without using an additional orchestrator. Some composers provide intricate details in how they want this to be accomplished and will provide the orchestrator with copious notes outlining which instruments are being asked to perform which notes, giving the orchestrator no personal creative input whatsoever beyond re-notating the music on different sheets of paper as appropriate. Other composers are less detailed, and will often ask orchestrators to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot;, providing their own creative input into the makeup of the ensemble, ensuring that each instrument is capable of performing the music as written, and even allowing them to introduce performance techniques and flourishes to enhance the score. In many cases, time constraints determined by the film&#x27;s post-production schedule dictate whether composers orchestrate their own scores, as it is often impossible for the composer to complete all the required tasks within the time frame allowed.

Over the years, several orchestrators have become linked to the work of one particular composer, often to the point where one will not work without the other.

Once the orchestration process has been completed, the sheet music is physically printed onto paper by one or more music copyists and is ready for performance.

===Recording===
When the music has been composed and orchestrated, the orchestra or ensemble then performs it, often with the composer conducting. Musicians for these ensembles are often uncredited in the film or on the album and are contracted individually (and if so, the orchestra contractor is credited in the film or the soundtrack album). However, some films have recently begun crediting the contracted musicians on the albums under the name Hollywood Studio Symphony after an agreement with the American Federation of Musicians. Other performing ensembles that are often employed include the London Symphony Orchestra (performing film music since 1935) the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra (an orchestra dedicated mostly to recording), the BBC Philharmonic, and the Northwest Sinfonia.

The orchestra performs in front of a large screen depicting the film, The conductor and musicians habitually wear headphones that sound a series of clicks called a &quot;click-track&quot; that changes with meter and tempo, assisting to synchronize the music with the film.

More rarely, the director will talk to the composer before shooting has started, so as to give more time to the composer or because the director needs to shoot scenes (namely song or dance scenes) according to the final score. Sometimes the director will have edited the film using &quot;temp (temporary) music&quot;: already published pieces with a character that the director believes to fit specific scenes.

==Elements of a film score==
Most films have between 45 and 120 minutes of music. However, some films have very little or no music; others may feature a score that plays almost continuously throughout.

===Temp tracks===
In some instances, film composers have been asked by the director to imitate a specific composer or style present in the temp track. On other occasions, directors have become so attached to the temp score that they decide to use it and reject the original score written by the film composer. One of the most famous cases is Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, where Kubrick opted for existing recordings of classical works, including pieces by composer György Ligeti rather than the score by Alex North, although Kubrick had also hired Frank Cordell to do a score. Other examples include &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (Bernard Herrmann), &quot;Troy&quot; (Gabriel Yared), &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (Alan Silvestri), Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot; (Howard Shore), Air Force One (Randy Newman) and &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (Carter Burwell).

===Structure===
Films often have different themes for important characters, events, ideas or objects, an idea often associated with Wagner&#x27;s use of leitmotif. These may be played in different variations depending on the situation they represent, scattered amongst incidental music. The themes for specific characters or locations are known as a motif where the rest of the track is usually centered around the particular motif and the track develops in line with the motif.

This common technique may often pass unnoticed by casual moviegoers, but has become well known among genre enthusiasts. One prominent example is John Williams&#x27; score for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, and the numerous themes in &quot;Star Wars&quot; music associated with individual characters such as Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia. Similarly, the music of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film series featured recurring themes for many main characters and places. Another notable example is Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s Klingon theme from &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), which later composers in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film series quoted in their Klingon motifs, and which was included on numerous occasions as a theme for Worf, the franchise&#x27;s most prominent Klingon character. Michael Giacchino employed character themes in the soundtrack for the 2009 animated film &quot;Up&quot;, for which he received the Academy Award for Best Score. His orchestral soundtrack for the television series &quot;Lost&quot; also depended heavily on character and situation-specific themes.

===Source music===
&quot;Source music&quot; (or a &quot;source cue&quot;) comes from an on screen source that can actually be seen or that can be inferred (in academic film theory such music is called &quot;diegetic&quot; music, as it emanates from the &quot;diegesis&quot; or &quot;story world&quot;). An example of &quot;source music&quot; is the use of the Frankie Valli song &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; in Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;. Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1963 thriller &quot;The Birds&quot; is an example of a Hollywood film with no non-diegetic music whatsoever. Dogme 95 is a filmmaking movement, started in Denmark in 1995, with a manifesto that prohibits any use of non-diegetic music in its films.

==Artistic merit==
===Music criticism===
The artistic merits of film music are frequently debated. Some critics value it highly, pointing to music such as that written by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Aaron Copland, Bernard Herrmann, and others. Some consider film music to be a defining genre of classical music in the late 20th century, if only because it is the brand of classical music heard more often than any other. In some cases, film themes have become accepted into the canon of classical music. These are mostly works from already noted composers who have done scores; for instance, Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s score to &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, or Vaughan Williams&#x27; score to &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot;. Others see the great bulk of film music as meritless. They consider that much film music is derivative, borrowing heavily from previous works. Composers of film scores typically can produce about three or four per year. The most popular works by composers such as John Williams are still far from entering the accepted classical canon, although there is a growing appreciation for the broader contribution of composers such as Williams among some classical composers and critics; for example, the Norwegian contemporary classical composer Marcus Paus has said that he considers Williams to be &quot;one of the great composers of any century&quot; who has &quot;found a very satisfying way of embodying dissonance and avant-garde techniques within a larger tonal framework&quot; and who &quot;might also have come the closest of any composer to realizing the old Schoenbergian utopia that children of the future would be whistling 12-tone rows.&quot; Even so, considering they are often the most popular modern compositions of classical music known to the general public, major orchestras sometimes perform concerts of such music, as do pops orchestras.

===Preservation efforts===
In 1983, a non-profit organization, the Society for the Preservation of Film Music, was formed to preserve the &quot;byproducts&quot; of creating a film score, including the music manuscripts (written music) and other documents and studio recordings generated in the process of composing and recording scores which, in some instances, have been discarded by movie studios. The written music must be kept to perform the music on concert programs and to make new recordings of it. Sometimes only after decades has an archival recording of a film score been released on CD.

==History==
The origins of film music are disputed, although they are generally considered to have aesthetic roots in various media forms associated with nineteenth-century Romanticism. According to Kurt London, film music &quot;began not as a result of any artistic urge, but from a dire need of something which would drown the noise made by the projector. For in those times there was as yet no sound-absorbent walls between the projection machine and the auditorium. This painful noise disturbed visual enjoyment to no small extent. Instinctively cinema proprietors had recourse to music, and it was the right way, using an agreeable sound to neutralize one less agreeable.&quot; On the contrary, film historian James Wierzbicki asserts that early film showings (such as the Lumière brothers&#x27; first film screening) would have been social events to the capacity that they had no need to mask the sounds of a projector mechanism. As these early films began to move out of exhibition spaces and into vaudeville theaters, the role of film began to shift as well. Given that vaudeville theaters typically employed musicians, it is likely that this is the point when it became commonplace for film to be accompanied by music. Audiences at the time would have come to expect music in the vaudeville space, and as such live musical accompaniment to films grew out naturally.

Before the age of recorded sound in motion pictures, efforts were taken to provide suitable music for films, usually through the services of an in-house pianist or organist, and, in some cases, entire orchestras, typically given cue sheets as a guide. A pianist was present to perform at the Lumière brothers&#x27; first film screening in 1895. In 1914, The Oz Film Manufacturing Company sent full-length scores by Louis F. Gottschalk for their films. Other examples of this include Victor Herbert&#x27;s score in 1915 to &quot;The Fall of a Nation&quot; (a sequel to &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;) and Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; music for &quot;The Assassination of the Duke of Guise&quot; in 1908. It was preceded by Nathaniel D. Mann&#x27;s score for &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot; by four months, but that was a mixture of interrelated stage and film performance in the tradition of old magic lantern shows. Most accompaniments at this time, these examples notwithstanding, comprised pieces by famous composers, also including studies. These were often used to form catalogues of photoplay music, which had different subsections broken down by &#x27;mood&#x27; and genre: dark, sad, suspense, action, chase, etc.

German cinema, which was highly influential in the era of silent movies, provided some original scores such as Fritz Lang&#x27;s movies &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot; (1924) and &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) which were accompanied by original full scale orchestral and leitmotific scores written by Gottfried Huppertz, who also wrote piano-versions of his music, for playing in smaller cinemas. Friedrich W. Murnau&#x27;s movies &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922 – music by Hans Erdmann) and &quot;Faust – Eine deutsche Volkssage&quot; (1926 – music by Werner Richard Heymann) also had original scores written for them. Other films like Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Der letzte Mann&quot; contained a mixing of original compositions (in this case by Giuseppe Becce) and library music / folk tunes, which were artistically included into the score by the composer. Much of this influence can be traced further back to German Romantic forms of music. Richard Wagner&#x27;s ideas on Gesamtkunstwerk and leitmotif in his operas were later picked up on by prominent film composer Max Steiner. Steiner and his contemporary Erich Korngold both immigrated from Vienna, bringing with them musical structures and ideologies of the late Romantic period.

In France, before the advent of talkies, Erik Satie composed what many consider the first &quot;frame by frame&quot; synchronous film score for director René Clair&#x27;s avant-garde short &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; (1924). Anticipating &quot;spotting&quot; techniques and the inconsistencies of projection speeds in screenings of silent films, Satie took precise timings for each sequence and created a flexible, aleatoric score of brief, evocative motifs which could be repeated and varied in tempo as required. American composers Virgil Thomson and Aaron Copland cited Satie&#x27;s music for &quot;Entr&#x27;acte&quot; as a major influence on their own forays into film scoring.

When sound came to movies, director Fritz Lang barely used music in his movies anymore. Apart from Peter Lorre whistling a short piece from Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, Lang&#x27;s movie &quot;M – Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder&quot; was lacking musical accompaniment completely and only included one original piece written for the movie by Hans Erdmann played at the very beginning and end of the movie. One of the rare occasions on which music occurs in the movie is a song one of the characters sings, that Lang uses to put emphasis on the man&#x27;s insanity, similar to the use of the whistling in &quot;M&quot;.

Early attempts at the synchronization of sound and image were failures, in large part due to mechanical and technological limitations. Phonographs, the only medium available for recorded sound in the early twentieth century, were difficult if not impossible to synchronize with the rotation of film projectors. In the cases where an attempt was made, sound was further limited by an inability to properly amplify it. However, in the 1920s improvements in radio technology allowed for the amplification of sound, and the invention of sound on film allowed for the synchronization thereof. A landmark event in music synchronization with the action in film was achieved in the score composed by Max Steiner for David O. Selznick&#x27;s 1933 &quot;King Kong.&quot; A fine example of this is when the aborigine chief slowly approaches the unwanted visitors to Skull Island who are filming the natives&#x27; sacred rites. As he strides closer and closer, each footfall is reinforced by a background chord.

Though &quot;the scoring of narrative features during the 1940s lagged decades behind technical innovations in the field of concert music,&quot; the 1950s saw the rise of the modernist film score. Director Elia Kazan was open to the idea of jazz influences and dissonant scoring and worked with Alex North, whose score for &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951) combined dissonance with elements of blues and jazz. Kazan also approached Leonard Bernstein to score &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954) and the result was reminiscent of earlier works by Aaron Copland and Igor Stravinsky with its &quot;jazz-based harmonies and exciting additive rhythms.&quot; A year later, Leonard Rosenman, inspired by Arnold Schoenberg, experimented with atonality in his scores for &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955) and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955). In his ten-year collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock, Bernard Herrmann experimented with ideas in &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) and &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960). The use of non-diegetic jazz was another modernist innovation, such as jazz star Duke Ellington&#x27;s score for Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959).

==Relation with directors==

Sometimes, a composer may unite with a director by composing the score for many films of a same director. John Williams&#x27; professional relationship with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas is one of the most prominent in film history, with Williams scoring all but five of Spielberg&#x27;s films, and all the installments of both of Lucas&#x27; blockbuster franchises (&quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;); Williams won all five of his Oscars in his collaborations with the two. Additionally, Danny Elfman did the score for all the movies directed by Tim Burton, with the exception of &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (score by Howard Shore) and &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (score by Stephen Sondheim). Other documented instance of director-composer relationships includes: Bernard Herrmann with Alfred Hitchcock; Jerry Goldsmith with Joe Dante and Franklin Schaffner; Ennio Morricone with Sergio Leone, Mauro Bolognini, and Giuseppe Tornatore; Henry Mancini with Blake Edwards; Georges Delerue with François Truffaut; Alan Silvestri with Robert Zemeckis; Angelo Badalamenti with David Lynch; James Newton Howard with M. Night Shyamalan; Éric Serra with Luc Besson; Patrick Doyle with Kenneth Branagh; Dave Grusin with Sydney Pollack; Howard Shore with David Cronenberg, Peter Jackson, and Martin Scorsese; Carter Burwell with Joel &amp; Ethan Coen; Bill Conti with John G. Avildsen; Lalo Schifrin with Don Siegel, Stuart Rosenberg, and Brett Ratner; Hans Zimmer with Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan; Harry Gregson-Williams with Tony Scott and Andrew Adamson; Clint Mansell with Darren Aronofsky; Dario Marianelli with Joe Wright; Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross with David Fincher; Steve Jablonsky with Michael Bay, Mychael Danna with Ang Lee and Atom Egoyan, Terence Blanchard with Spike Lee, Randy Newman with John Lasseter; Thomas Newman with Sam Mendes; David Newman with Danny Devito, Brian Levant, and Stephen Herek; John Debney with Jon Favreau and Garry Marshall; Gabriel Yared with Anthony Minghella; Joe Kraemer with Christopher McQuarrie; Michael Giacchino with J.

==Production music==

Many companies provide music to various film, TV and commercial projects for a fee. Sometimes called library music, the music is owned by production music libraries and licensed to customers for use in film, television, radio and other media. Examples of firms include Warner Chappell Production Music, Jingle Punks, Associated Production Music, FirstCom Music, VideoHelper and Extreme Music. Unlike popular and classical music publishers, who typically own less than 50 percent of the copyright in a composition, music production libraries own all of the copyrights of their music, meaning that it can be licensed without seeking the composer&#x27;s permission, as is necessary in licensing music from normal publishers. This is because virtually all music created for music libraries is done on a work for hire basis. Production music is therefore a very convenient medium for media producers – they can be assured that they will be able to license any piece of music in the library at a reasonable rate.

Production music libraries will typically offer a broad range of musical styles and genres, enabling producers and editors to find much of what they need in the same library. Music libraries vary in size from a few hundred tracks up to many thousands. The first production music library was set up by De Wolfe Music in 1927 with the advent of sound in film, the company originally scored music for use in silent film. Another music library was set up by Ralph Hawkes of Boosey &amp; Hawkes Music Publishers in the 1930s. APM, the largest US library, has over 250,000 tracks.

<doc id="176951" wikidata="Q633544" url="?curid=176951" title="Rush (Rush album)">
<text>Rush is the debut studio album by Canadian rock band Rush. It was released on March 18, 1974, in Canada by Moon Records, the group&#x27;s own label, before it was released internationally by Mercury Records later that year. Recorded five years after the band&#x27;s formation, this first release shows much of the hard rock sound typical of many of the popular rock bands emerging earlier in the decade. Rush were fans of such bands as Led Zeppelin, Yes and Cream, and these influences can be heard in most of the songs on the album.

Original drummer John Rutsey performed all drum parts on the album, but was unable to go on extended tours because of complications with his diabetes and so he retired from the band after the album was released. Rutsey worked on lyrics for the album, but never submitted them to the other members of the band. The lyrics were instead entirely composed by vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson. Rutsey was soon replaced by Neil Peart, who served as both drummer and primary lyricist on all subsequent Rush albums.

==Recording and production==

The initial recording sessions were produced by Dave Stock at Eastern Sound Studios in Toronto in two days during the Summer of 1973. They were scheduled late at night during the &#x27;dead&#x27; time in studios because of the band&#x27;s low budget and the rates during this period were the cheapest. By request of the band&#x27;s management, Rush included their version of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, a staple of the band&#x27;s live-set during that time, for a possible single-release. The song was eventually released as Rush&#x27;s debut single in September 1973, backed with &quot;You Can&#x27;t Fight It&quot;, a song originally planned for inclusion on the album, but that idea was scrapped in favour of new songs.
From this original recording session, &quot;In the Mood&quot; and &quot;Take A Friend&quot; would be included in the final album.

However, Rush were unhappy with the quality of the first sessions. They moved to Toronto Sound Studios in November 1973 and produced these sessions themselves while achieving a significant improvement in recording quality, with the help of engineer Terry Brown. They added new overdubs to existing backing tracks of &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;, &quot;Before and After&quot; and &quot;Working Man&quot; from the first session. In the meantime, the band had written new songs that were recorded entirely at Toronto Sound: &quot;Finding My Way&quot;, &quot;Need Some Love&quot; and &quot;Here Again&quot;. These new songs took the place of songs from the earlier sessions. Both studios used 8-channel multitrack recorders, which was quite primitive for 1973, but the group quickly learned to make the best use of the technology that was available.

In July 2008, Rush discovered a version of &quot;Working Man&quot; with an alternative guitar solo. They allowed the makers of the popular rhythm game &quot;Rock Band&quot; to use the master tapes for the song&#x27;s inclusion.

==Distribution and release==
The band and its management formed their own company, Moon Records, and released the album in Canada. Only 3,500 copies of the original Moon Records LP, catalogue number MN-100, were pressed. The promotional version of the LP has a cream-coloured label with a blue Moon Records logo and black type. The remaining 3,500 were blue labeled with a blue Moon Records logo and black type.

The album was soon picked up by WMMS, a radio station in Cleveland, Ohio. Donna Halper, a DJ working at the station, selected &quot;Working Man&quot; for her regular play list. Every time the song was played the station received phone calls asking where to buy the record. Copies of the Moon Records album were imported to the Cleveland area and quickly sold out. In the 2010 documentary film &quot;&quot;, Halper says that &quot;Working Man&quot; was the perfect song for the Cleveland rock audience, as it was still mostly a factory town in 1974. WMMS later sponsored one of Rush&#x27;s first performances in the United States, in Cleveland on August 26, 1974.

The record&#x27;s popularity in Cleveland quickly led to the re-release of the album by Mercury Records on August 10, 1974. The first Canadian Mercury release on the standard red Mercury label is nearly as rare as the Moon version. It also had the Moon number MN-100 between the run-out grooves, indicating that it was pressed from the same metal stampers as the Moon disc. &quot;A special thank you to Donna Halper for getting the ball rolling&quot; was added to the album credits of this and all later versions.

At this point manager Ray Danniels scraped together an additional $9,000 for producer Terry Brown to professionally re-mix all of the recordings for better sound quality. This remix version was used for later releases, most of which used the Mercury &quot;skyline&quot; record label instead of the red label. A later Moon Records version of undetermined origin has a pink label with grey moon craters.

The original album logo was red, but a printing error made it appear more magenta in colour. This is one of two Rush albums where the cover artwork had printing errors, the other album being &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;.

The complete album, along with &quot;Fly by Night&quot; and &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;, was included as part of the 1978 Anthem release &quot;Archives.&quot; 

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rush&quot; received positive reviews upon its 1974 release. Writing for the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, Bill Provick gave praise on the band&#x27;s &quot;immediate acceleration&quot; and &quot;driving, crisp sound&quot;, although he felt that &quot;the energy needs a bit more channeling and the arrangements need a touch more refining&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that it &quot;serves up a dose of good hard rock highlighted by the often Robert Plant-like lead vocals of Geddy Lee and the powerful guitar work of Alex Lifeson and solid drumming from John Rutsey.&quot;

However, critical reception in later years has been more negative. Greg Prato of AllMusic stated in his review of the album that it was weaker than some of the band&#x27;s later works, such as &quot;Hemispheres&quot; and &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, because Neil Peart was not yet a part of the band. He finished his review by saying, &quot;While longtime Rush fans can appreciate their debut because they never returned to this style, newcomers should stick with their classics from later years.&quot;

==Remaster==
A remaster was issued in 1997.
* The tray has a picture of the star with man painting (mirroring the cover art of &quot;Retrospective I&quot;) with &quot;The Rush Remasters&quot; printed in all capital letters just to the left. All remasters from &quot;Rush&quot; through &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; are like this.

&quot;Rush&quot; was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the &quot;Sector&quot; box sets, which re-released all of Rush&#x27;s Mercury-era albums. The album is included in the &quot;Sector 1&quot; set.

The album was remastered and re-released on vinyl in April 2014 as part of a box set to celebrate its 40th anniversary. The 2014 vinyl version included a replica of the original Moon Records label on the LP.

&quot;Rush&quot; was remastered for vinyl in 2015 as a part of the official &quot;12 Months of Rush&quot; promotion. The high definition master prepared for this release was also made available for purchase in 24-bit/96 kHz and 24-bit/192 kHz formats, at several high-resolution audio online music stores. These masters have significantly less dynamic range compression than the 1997 remasters and the &quot;Sector&quot; remasters by Andy VanDette.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, except &quot;Need Some Love&quot; which its lyrics were written by Lee with John Rutsey, and &quot;In the Mood&quot;, written solely by Lee.

<text>Blake is a surname which originated from Old English. Its derivation is uncertain; it could come from &quot;blac&quot;, a nickname for someone who had dark hair or skin, or from &quot;blaac&quot;, a nickname for someone with pale hair or skin. Another theory, presumably in the belief it is a Welsh patronymic in origin, for which there is no evidence, was that it is a corruption of &quot;Ap Lake&quot;, meaning &quot;Son of Lake&quot;.

Blake was the name of one of the 14 Tribes of Galway in Ireland. These Blakes were descendants of Richard Caddell, alias Blake, who was involved in the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169. As such a long present foreign name, it became known as de Bláca in Irish.

The origins of the name Blake are also considered to be Old Norse, first appearing in Yorkshire, England, possibly derived from the word Blaker, referring to a village and a former municipality of Akershus county, Norway (east of Oslo).

Blake often refers to the British poet, painter and printmaker William Blake (1757–1827).

<doc id="176956" wikidata="Q248096" url="?curid=176956" title="The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling">
<text>The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, often known simply as Tom Jones, is a comic novel by English playwright and novelist Henry Fielding. It is a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; and a picaresque novel. It was first published on 28 February 1749 in London and is among the earliest English works to be classified as a novel. It is the earliest novel mentioned by W. Somerset Maugham in his 1948 book &quot;Great Novelists and Their Novels,&quot; in which Maugham ranks the ten best novels of the world.

The novel is highly organised despite its length. Samuel Taylor Coleridge argued that it has one of the &quot;three most perfect plots ever planned&quot;, alongside &quot;Oedipus Tyrannus&quot; by Sophocles and &quot;The Alchemist&quot; by Ben Jonson. It became a best-seller, with four editions published in its first year alone. It is generally regarded as Fielding&#x27;s greatest book and as an influential English novel.

==Plot==
The wealthy Squire Allworthy and his sister Bridget are introduced in their estate in Somerset. Allworthy returns from London after an extended business trip and finds an abandoned baby sleeping in his bed. He summons his housekeeper, Mrs Deborah Wilkins, to take care of the child. After searching the nearby village Mrs Wilkins is told about Jenny Jones, the young servant of a schoolmaster and his wife, as the most likely person to have committed the deed. Jenny is brought before the Allworthys and admits being the one who put the baby in the bed, but refuses to reveal the father&#x27;s identity. Mr. Allworthy removes Jenny to a place where her reputation will be unknown and tells Bridget to raise the boy, whom he names Thomas, in his household.

Two brothers, Dr Blifil and Captain Blifil, regularly visit the Allworthy estate. The doctor introduces the captain to Bridget in the hope of marrying into Allworthy&#x27;s wealth. The couple soon marries. After the marriage, Captain Blifil begins to show a coldness to his brother, who eventually feels obliged to leave the house for London. He does, and later dies &quot;of a broken heart.&quot; Captain Blifil and Bridget start to grow cool towards one another, and the former is found dead from apoplexy one evening after taking his customary evening stroll before dinner. By then, he has fathered a boy who grows up with the bastard Tom. Captain Blifil&#x27;s son, known as Master Blifil, is a jealous boy who conspires against Tom.

Tom grows into a youth. He tends to be closer friends with the servants and gamekeepers than with members of the gentry. He is close friends with Black George, who is the gamekeeper. His first love is Molly, Black George&#x27;s second daughter. She throws herself at Tom, who then feels obliged to offer her his protection after learning that she is pregnant. However, Tom later realizes that Molly is somewhat promiscuous. He then falls in love with a neighbouring squire&#x27;s daughter, Sophia Western. Tom and Sophia confess their love for each other after he breaks his arm rescuing her. Tom&#x27;s status as a bastard causes Sophia&#x27;s father and Allworthy to disapprove their love.

Squire Allworthy falls ill and is convinced that he is dying. His family and servants gather around his bed as he disposes of his wealth. He gives a favourable amount of it to Tom, which displeases Master Blifil. Tom does not care about what he has been given, since his only concern is Allworthy&#x27;s health. Allworthy&#x27;s health improves and he learns that he will live. Tom is so excited that he gets drunk and eventually fights with Master Blifil. Meanwhile, Bridget dies in London. Wanting to conceal her love for Tom, Sophia gives a majority of her attention to Blifil when the three of them are together. This leads to Sophia&#x27;s aunt, Mrs Western, believing that Sophia and Blifil are in love. Squire Western wants Sophia to marry Blifil to gain property from the Allworthy estate. Blifil learns of Sophia&#x27;s affection for Tom and is angry. Blifil tells Allworthy that, on the day he almost died, Tom was out drinking and celebrating his coming death. This leads Tom to be banished.

Tom&#x27;s banishment seems to ensure that Sophia will be forced to marry Blifil, whom she finds odious, so she flees to avoid that fate. Meanwhile, expelled from Allworthy&#x27;s estate, Tom begins his adventures across Britain, eventually ending up in London. En route, he meets a barber, Partridge, who was banished from town because he was thought to be Tom&#x27;s father. He becomes Tom&#x27;s faithful companion in the hope of restoring his reputation. During their journey, they end up at an inn. While they are there, a lady and her maid arrive. An angry man arrives, and the chambermaid points him in the direction that she thinks he needs to go. He bursts in on Tom and Mrs Waters, a woman whom Tom rescued, in bed together. The man, however, was looking for Mrs Fitzpatrick and leaves. Sophia and her maid arrive at the same inn, and Partridge unknowingly reveals the relationship between Tom and Mrs Waters. Sophia leaves with Mrs Fitzpatrick, who is her cousin, and heads for London. They arrive at the home of Lady Bellaston, followed by Tom and Partridge. Eventually, Tom says that his true love is for Sophia and no one else. Tom ends up getting into a duel with Mr Fitzpatrick, which leads to his imprisonment.

Eventually, the secret of Tom&#x27;s birth is revealed after a brief scare involving Mrs Waters. Mrs Waters is really Jenny Jones, Tom&#x27;s supposed mother, and Tom fears that he committed incest. This, however, is not the case, as Tom&#x27;s mother is in fact Bridget, who conceived him with a man who died before he was born. Tom is thus Squire Allworthy&#x27;s nephew. After finding out about the intrigues of Blifil, who is Tom&#x27;s half-brother, Allworthy decides to bestow most of his inheritance on Tom. After Tom&#x27;s true parentage is revealed, he and Sophia marry, as Squire Western no longer harbours any misgivings about Tom marrying his daughter. Sophia bears Tom a son and a daughter, and the couple live on happily with the blessings of Squire Western and Squire Allworthy.

==Style==
The highly visible narrator is a central feature of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. Each book begins with a prefatory chapter directly addressing the reader, and the narrator provides a continuous commentary on characters and events. &quot;Lady Bellaston&quot;, for instance, is widely believed to have been inspired by the real life character of Etheldreda Townshend. According to Wayne C. Booth, the reader&#x27;s relationship with the narrator is something like a subplot. The reader becomes more attached to the narrator over the course of the book, culminating in a heartfelt farewell.

Fielding presents a panorama of contemporary British life, drawing characters from many different classes and occupations. But Ian Watt argues in &quot;The Rise of the Novel&quot; that Fielding did not aim at the &quot;realism of presentation&quot; of lifelike detail and psychology practised by authors such as Richardson. Watt claims that Fielding was more focused on the &quot;realism of assessment,&quot; the way in which the novel engages a broad range of topics with intelligence and &quot;a wise assessment of life.&quot;

==Themes==
The main theme of the novel is the contrast between Tom Jones&#x27;s good nature, flawed but eventually corrected by his love for virtuous Sophia Western, and his half-brother Blifil&#x27;s hypocrisy. Secondary themes include several other examples of virtue (especially that of Squire Allworthy), hypocrisy (especially that of Thwackum) and villainy (for example, that of Mrs Western and Ensign Northerton), sometimes tempered by repentance (for instance Square and Mrs Waters &quot;née&quot; Jones).

Both introductory chapters to each book and interspersed commentary introduce a long line of further themes. For instance, introductory chapters dwell extensively on bad writers and critics, quite unrelated to the plot but apologetic to the author and the novel itself; and authorial commentary on several characters shows strong opposition to Methodism, calling it fanatical and heretical, and falsely implying an association between Methodism and hypocrites such as the younger Blifil.

The novel takes place against the backdrop of the Jacobite rising of 1745. Characters take different sides over the rebellion, which was an attempt to restore Roman Catholicism as the established religion of England and to undo the Glorious Revolution. At one point Sophia Western is even mistaken for Jenny Cameron, the supposed lover of Bonnie Prince Charlie. Good-natured characters are often moderately loyalist and Anglican, or even supporters of the House of Hanover, while ill-natured characters (Mrs Western) or mistaken ones (Partridge) can be Jacobites, or (like Squire Western) anti-Hanoverian.

<text>Deseret (; Deseret: 𐐔𐐯𐑅𐐨𐑉𐐯𐐻) is a term derived from the Book of Mormon, a scripture of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and other Latter Day Saint groups. According to the Book of Mormon, &quot;deseret&quot; meant &quot;honeybee&quot; in the language of the Jaredites, a group in the Book of Mormon that were led by God to the Americas after the construction of the Tower of Babel (see ). Latter-day Saint scholar Hugh Nibley (extending the work of Egyptologist Sir Alan Gardiner) suggested an etymology by associating the word &quot;Deseret&quot; with the ancient Egyptian &quot;deshret&quot; (Egyptian: 𓂧𓈙𓂋𓏏𓋔), a term he translated as the &quot;bee crown&quot; of the Lower Kingdom, but which non-LDS scholarly sources translate as the &quot;Red Crown&quot;.

==Proposed State of Deseret==

Deseret was proposed as a name for the U.S. state of Utah. Brigham Young—governor of Utah Territory from 1850 to 1858 and president of the LDS Church from 1847 to 1877—favored the name as a symbol of industry. Young taught that Church members should be productive and self-sufficient, a trait he had perceived in honeybees. 

The Mormons petitioned for statehood as the State of Deseret during 1849–50, but the petition was rejected by the U.S. Congress because of the vast size of the relatively unpopulated area that was controlled by the LDS Church. Instead, the federal government created Utah Territory. 

The name is often thought to be derived from the resident Ute Indians and mean &quot;People of the Mountains&quot;. However, local Ute tribe members, such as Larry Cesspooch, public relations director for the audio/visual department of the Ute Tribe in Fort Duchesne, stated that &quot;the Utes don&#x27;t even have such a word in their language.&quot; He said that Utah - Anglicized from &quot;Yuta&quot; - is what the Spanish called the Utes, and his research indicates that it meant &quot;meat eaters&quot;. Cesspooch has used this explanation in various public presentations, and has said that he&#x27;s never been challenged on it. In 1896, Utah Territory gained statehood as Utah.

Some vestiges of the name survive. For example, the state symbol of Utah is a beehive; this emblem is represented on both the state seal, state flag, and marker shields for state highways. The state nickname is the &quot;Beehive State&quot; and the honeybee is Utah&#x27;s official &quot;state insect&quot;. The Salt Lake Bees are a minor league baseball team representing Utah in the Pacific Coast League. Named after the original Salt Lake Bees (PCL, 1915–26), they were formerly known as the Buzz (1994–2000) and the Stingers (2001–05). &quot;Deseret&quot; appears twice on the Utah stone located on the landing of the Washington Monument.

==Other uses==
Various businesses and organizations use &quot;Deseret&quot; as part of their name, particularly those that have connections to the LDS Church. Examples include:
*Deseret alphabet — a non-Latin phonetic alphabet developed during the mid-19th century by the board of regents of the University of Deseret (University of Utah) as directed by Brigham Young
*Deseret Book — the world&#x27;s largest LDS bookstore chain
*Deseret First Credit Union — formerly known as the LDS Church Employees Credit Union
*Deseret Industries — a Utah-based thrift store
*Deseret Nation — an alt-right Twitter grouping of LDS Church members
*&quot;Deseret News&quot; — Utah&#x27;s second-largest daily newspaper
*Deseret Ranch — a large cattle ranch in Florida, United States
*Deseret, Utah — a village

<doc id="176958" wikidata="Q155810" url="?curid=176958" title="AVUS">
<text>The  (&#x27;Automobile traffic and training road&#x27;), known as AVUS (), is a public road in Berlin, Germany. Opened in 1921, it was also used as a motor racing circuit until 1998. Today, the AVUS forms the northern part of the Bundesautobahn 115.

==Circuit==
The highway is located in the southwestern districts of Berlin, linking the Stadtring at the Funkturm junction in Charlottenburg with Nikolassee. It runs through the Grunewald forest along the historic &quot;Königsweg&quot; road from Charlottenburg to Potsdam and the parallel Berlin-Blankenheim railway line.

While normal for a road, it is unusually shaped for a race track as it is essentially two long straights in the form of a dual carriageway, with a hairpin corner at each end. The north curve featured a steep banking from 1937 to 1967. While the original layout was long, the southern turn was moved several times, to shorten the track to , then without the banking, and finally .

==History==

In 1907 the Kaiserlicher Automobilclub (KAC) association devised a fee-financed circuit, as both a motor-sport venue and a testing track for the motor industry. A developing company was established in 1909; however, a lack of finances and official authorisations delayed the start of construction until spring 1913. During the Great War works discontinued, and though Russian Army prisoners were temporarily employed in AVUS&#x27;s construction, the track was still unfinished. From 1920 the remaining road work was financed by businessman and politician Hugo Stinnes. The circuit, including a gate building and several stands, was inaugurated during the first post-war International Automobile Exhibition (IAA) with a motor race on 24 September 1921. Afterwards the road was open to the public at a charge of ten Marks.

===Race track===
At the time of opening, AVUS was long – each straight being approximately half that length, and joined at each end by flat, large-radius curves, driven counter-clockwise.

While the Grand Prix motor racing scene still evaded German tracks, the circuit from 1922 was also the site of motorcycle races. On 11 July 1926 the track played host to the first international German Grand Prix for sports cars, organised by the Automobilclub von Deutschland, the former KAC. The 1921 roadway turned out to be insufficient: Already, in practice two days before, the young Italian driver Enrico Platé (not to be confused with the Argentinian driver and team owner of the same name) was involved in a crash that killed his mechanic. During the race, in heavy rain, two track marshals died when Adolf Rosenberger lost control and hit the indicator board and the timekeeper&#x27;s box, with a third employee succumbing to his injuries in hospital a few hours later. The Grand Prix was won by his fellow team-member, the so-far unknown Mercedes-Benz salesman Rudolf Caracciola, from Remagen, driving a private, eight-cylinder &quot;Monza&quot; Kompressor type. The fastest lap of was set by Ferdinando Minoia in an OM.

From 1927 the German Grand Prix was relocated to the new and more secure Nürburgring circuit in the Western German Eifel range, while the AVUS received a new asphalt surface and served as an experimental track for rocket cars.

On 23 May 1928 Fritz von Opel (&quot;Rocket Fritz&quot;) achieved a speed record of in an Opel RAK2.

Due to the Great Depression annual auto races were not resumed until 1931, when Caracciola again won in a Mercedes-Benz SSK, succeeded by Manfred von Brauchitsch the next year after Caracciola had switched to Alfa Romeo.

The competition on 22 May 1932 saw further notable participants like the Earl Howe, Hans Stuck and Sir Malcolm Campbell. The Czechoslovak driver, Prince George Christian of Lobkowicz, died when his Bugatti Type 54 crashed in the southern hairpin. The following events were won by Achille Varzi (1933) and Guy Moll (1934), to the great annoyance of the new Nazi rulers, who declared the victory of German drivers and cars a matter of national pride. They strongly backed the construction of the new Silver Arrows (&quot;Silberpfeile&quot;) generation of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union.

In 1935 Luigi Fagioli won the race in a Mercedes-Benz W25; however, the track was no longer adequate for cars reaching average race speeds of far over . In an effort to make AVUS the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest race track&quot;, the 1936 season was skipped and while the track hosted the cycling road race, the marathon and 50 km walk athletic events of the 1936 Summer Olympics, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn (43°) made of bricks. It became dubbed the &quot;wall of death&quot;, especially as it had no retaining barrier, so cars that missed the turn easily flew off it. The Silver Arrows raced only once on the banked version, in 1937. As the AVUS race did not count towards the championship, non-GP cars were allowed, which permitted the use of streamlined cars, similar to the cars used for high speed record attempts. This race was run in two heats; during qualifying for the second heat, Luigi Fagioli stuck his Auto Union Type C on pole position, with a time of 4 minutes and 8.2 seconds at an average speed of - which was the fastest motor racing lap in history until this time was bettered by Tony Bettenhausen in qualifying for the 1957 Race of Two Worlds at Monza. It was also bettered by four drivers during the 1971 Indianapolis 500. Mercedes driver Hermann Lang&#x27;s average race speed of about was the fastest road race in history for nearly five decades, and was not matched on a high-speed banked-circuit until the mid-1980s at the 1986 Indianapolis 500.

No major race was held after 1937 as, in early 1938, the popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer was killed in a land speed record attempt on a straight section of the Autobahn Frankfurt–Darmstadt (present-day Bundesautobahn 5), at which point the high-speed AVUS was considered too dangerous for the fast Grand Prix race cars. Furthermore, it was to be connected to the growing &quot;Reichsautobahn&quot; network in 1940 by extending it south towards the Berliner Ring, therefore the original hairpin at Nikolassee was demolished and replaced by a junction. A planned banked south turn was never built; the cleared grounds in the Grunewald forest were used as a proving ground (&quot;Keerans Range&quot;) by the American occupation forces after World War II.

===Post-war===
The first AVUS race after the war was held on 1 July 1951 for Formula Two and Formula Three cars, won by East German driver Paul Greifzu. For post-war racing, the original extremely long straights were shortened by the introduction of a new south turn roughly in the middle (just before the &quot;Hüttenweg&quot; exit, where it can still be seen), reducing the track length to . After World War II, the Berlin Wall, with its Checkpoint Bravo at Dreilinden/Drewitz, came no closer than about one mile (1.6 km) to the former South Turn. It is a common yet incorrect belief that the Berlin Wall cut the AVUS in half.

It was not until 19 September 1954 that this shorter track hosted a non-championship Formula One race. This &quot;Grand Prix of Berlin&quot; was mainly a show dominated by the Mercedes-Benz W196 drivers Karl Kling (the winner) and Juan Manuel Fangio. No serious competition was present, as many teams had refused to show up and the German Grand Prix was still held on the Nürburgring. Finally AVUS hosted its only world championship Formula One race with the 1959 German Grand Prix on 2 August, won by Tony Brooks. This race weekend also saw the death of French driver Jean Behra in a supporting sports car race, as his Porsche RSK flew over the top of the north turn banking, as there was no wall or fence. German driver and journalist Richard von Frankenberg had previously walked away from a similar spectacular crash at the same site, but Behra would have no such luck as his body impacted a flagpole head-first after he was flung from his car.

After 1961, Grand Prix racing did not race on banked circuits until 2000. The banked sections at Autodromo Nazionale Monza and Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry were considered dangerous by international racing standards. They were used in connection with chicanes for some time, then abandoned. Banking only returned to Formula One in 2000 when the series used a road course at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The AVUS banking was dismantled in 1967 to give way to an expanded intersection under the Funkturm tower. From the top of this tower, one can see that the AVUS is not perfectly straight.

The old banked circuit can be seen in the film &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot; (1968) featuring period racing cars.

Racing was continued with a flat north turn, but AVUS only held national touring cars DTM and Formula Three events. The length of the track was roughly cut in half twice in the 1980s and 1990 as racing on straights became unpopular. Also, chicanes were added to reduce entry speed into the North Curve. Yet, some incidents and accidents occurred. The BMW of Dieter Quester rolled over when exiting the last corner, and crossed the finish line sliding on its roof, with sparks flying, for a podium finish. The car of John Winter hit a barrier and exploded into a fireball in North Curve, which he survived.

In 1995, the race 2 of DTM had to be cancelled, after a multi-car pileup blocked the circuit; later that September, British driver Kieth O&#x27;dor was killed in a Super Touring Car event when his car spun and was rammed sideways, with the impact on the driver&#x27;s side.

===AVUS today===
After the fall of the Berlin wall, the closure of the AVUS for race events became increasingly problematic over traffic and associated environmental concerns. After the last races in 1998, a farewell event with veterans was held in 1999. Since 2000, the new EuroSpeedway Lausitz in Brandenburg is considered the replacement venue for competition. The round race control tower at the north end still remains with its prominent Mercedes-Benz and Bosch sponsorship insignia. It was used as a (now closed) public restaurant and motel. The old wooden grandstand is protected as a historic monument.

<doc id="176959" wikidata="Q1673835" url="?curid=176959" title="Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius">
<text>&quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; is a short story by the 20th-century Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. The story was first published in the Argentine journal &quot;Sur&quot;, May 1940. The &quot;postscript&quot; dated 1947 is intended to be anachronistic, set seven years in the future. The first English-language translation of the story, by James E. Irby, was published in 1961 in New World Writing N° 18. In 1962 it was included in &quot;Labyrinths&quot; (short story collection) (New Directions), the first collection of Borges&#x27; works published in English.

Told in a first-person narrative, the story focuses on the author&#x27;s discovery of the mysterious and possibly fictional country of Uqbar and its legend of Tlön, a mythical world whose inhabitants believe a form of subjective idealism, denying the reality of objects and nouns, as well as &quot;Orbis Tertius&quot;, the secret organization that created both fictional locations. Relatively long for Borges (approximately 5,600 words), the story is a work of speculative fiction.

The story alludes to many leading intellectual figures both in Argentina and in the world at large, and takes up a number of themes more typical of a novel of ideas. Most of the ideas engaged are in the areas of metaphysics, language, epistemology, and literary criticism.

==Summary==
The reportage unfolds as a first-person narrative and contains many references (see below) to real people, locations, literary works and philosophical concepts, besides some fictional or ambiguous ones. It is divided into two parts and a postscript. Events and facts are revealed roughly in the order that the narrator becomes aware of them or their relevance. The timing of events in Borges&#x27;s story is approximately from 1935 to 1947; the plot concerns events going back as far as the early 17th century and culminating in the postscript, set in 1947.

===Part one===
Borges and his friend and collaborator, Adolfo Bioy Casares, are developing their next book in a country house near Buenos Aires, in 1940. In an observation, Bioy quotes that &quot;mirrors and copulation are abominable because they increase the number of men&quot; from a heresiarch of a land named Uqbar. Borges, impressed with the &quot;memorable&quot; sentence, asks for its source. Bioy replies that he had read it in the chapter about Uqbar of the &quot;Anglo-American Cyclopaedia&quot;, &quot;a literal if inadequate reprint&quot; of the 1902 edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. They check the book and are unable to find the said chapter, to Bioy&#x27;s surprise. The two then search for the name &#x27;Uqbar&#x27; in numerous atlases and other encyclopedias, trying different alternative spellings, to no avail.

The following day, Bioy tells Borges he has found the chapter they were looking for in a different reprint of the same encyclopedia. The chapter, although brief and full of names unfamiliar to Borges and Bioy, entices their curiosity. It describes Uqbar as an obscure region, located in Iraq or Asia Minor, with an all-fantastic literature taking place in the mythical worlds of Mlejnas and Tlön. Afterwards, they keep searching for Uqbar in other sources, but are unable to find any mention.

===Part two===
The engineer Herbert Ashe, an English friend of Borges&#x27; father with a peculiar interest in duodecimal systems, dies of an aneurysm rupture. Borges inherits a packet containing a book, which was left by Ashe in a pub. That book is revealed to be the eleventh volume of an English-language encyclopedia entirely devoted to Tlön, one of the worlds in which Uqbar&#x27;s legends are set. The book contains two oval blue stamps with the words Orbis Tertius inscribed in blue. From that point, as Borges reads the tome, part two comprehensively describes and discusses Tlön&#x27;s culture, history, languages and philosophy.

The people of the imaginary Tlön hold an extreme form of Berkeley&#x27;s subjective idealism, denying the reality of the material world. Their world is understood &quot;not as a concurrence of objects in space, but as a heterogeneous series of independent acts.&quot; One of the imagined language families of Tlön lacks nouns, being centered instead in impersonal verbs qualified by monosyllabic adverbial affixes. Borges lists a Tlönic equivalent of &quot;The moon rose above the water&quot;: &quot;hlör u fang axaxaxas mlö&quot;, meaning literally &quot;upward, behind the onstreaming it mooned.&quot; (Andrew Hurley, one of Borges&#x27; translators, wrote a fiction in which he says that the words &quot;axaxaxas mlö&quot; &quot;can only be pronounced as the author&#x27;s cruel, mocking laughter&quot;.) In another language family of Tlön, &quot;the basic unit is not the verb, but the monosyllabic adjective&quot;, which in combinations of two or more forms nouns: &quot;moon&quot; becomes &quot;round airy-light on dark&quot; or &quot;pale-orange-of-the-sky&quot;.

A dissident scholar of Tlön, going against the established philosophy and languages, tried to propound the theory of materialism, suggesting that a number of coins still existed after a man lost them and they could not be seen by anyone, &quot;albeit in some secret way that we are forbidden to understand&quot;. The proposition was scandalous and widely rejected by Tlön&#x27;s academia, who considered it a sophism and a fallacy. A century later, another thinker formulated a pantheistic conjecture that &quot;there is but a single subject; that indivisible subject is every being in the universe, and the beings of the universe are the organs and masks of the deity&quot;; this ended up triumphing over all other schools of thought. One of the effects is the rejection of authorship, with books seldom being signed and the concept of plagiarism being alien because &quot;all books are the work of a single author who is timeless and anonymous&quot;.

Another influence of that idealism is that, for about a hundred years, a class of duplicating, apparently atemporal objects called &quot;hrönir&quot; (singular &quot;hrön&quot;) have been produced in Tlön. Objects also &quot;grow vague or sketchy and lose detail&quot; when they begin to be forgotten, culminating in their disappearance when they are completely forgotten.

===Postscript===
In the anachronistic postscript set in 1947, Borges remembers events that occurred in the last years.

In 1941, the world and the narrator have learned, through the emergence of a letter, about the true nature of Tlön. It goes that a &quot;benevolent secret society&quot; was formed &quot;one night in Lucerne or in London&quot;, in the 17th century, and had Berkeley among its members. That group, a society of intellectuals named &quot;Orbis Tertius&quot;, studied &quot;hermetic studies, philanthropy and the cabala&quot; (an allusion to societies such as the Bavarian Illuminati, the Freemasons and the Rosicrucians), but its main purpose was to create a country: Uqbar. It gradually became clear that such work would have to be carried by numerous generations, so each master agreed to elect a disciple who would carry on his work to perpetuate an hereditary arrangement. The society is eventually persecuted, but reemerges in the United States two centuries thereafter. The American &quot;eccentric&quot; millionaire Ezra Buckley, one of the members of the restored sect, finds its undertaking too modest, proposing that their creation be of an entire world instead of just a country. He also adds that an entire encyclopedia about this world—named Tlön—must be written and that the whole scheme &quot;have no pact with that impostor Jesus Christ.&quot; The new &quot;Orbis Tertius&quot;, composed of three hundred collaborators, proceeds to conclude the final volume of the First Encyclopedia of Tlön. An explanation of Uqbar is not explicitly given in the story.

By 1942, Tlönian objects began to inexplicably appear in the real world. One of the first instances in which this occurs is when Princess Faucigny Lucinge received, via mail, a vibrating compass with a Tlönian scripture. Another instance is witnessed by Borges himself: a drunk man, shortly after dying, dropped coins among which a small but extremely heavy shining metal cone appeared. It is suggested that these occurrences may have been forgeries, but yet products of a secret science and technology.

By 1944, all forty volumes of the First Encyclopedia of Tlön have been discovered and published in a library in Memphis, Tennessee. The material becomes accessible worldwide and immensely influential on Earth&#x27;s culture, science and languages. By the time Borges concludes the story, presumably in 1947, the world is gradually becoming Tlön. Borges then turns to an obsession of his own: a translation of Sir Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;Urn Burial&quot; into Spanish.

==Major themes==

===Philosophical themes===
Through the vehicle of fantasy or speculative fiction, this story playfully explores several philosophical questions and themes. These include, above all, an effort by Borges to imagine a world (Tlön) where the 18th century philosophical subjective idealism of George Berkeley is viewed as common sense and &quot;the doctrine of materialism&quot; is considered a heresy, a scandal, and a paradox. Through describing the languages of Tlön, the story also plays with the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis (also called &quot;linguistic relativism&quot;)—the epistemological question of how language influences what thoughts are possible. The story also contains several metaphors for the way ideas influence reality. This last theme is first explored cleverly, by way of describing physical objects being willed into existence by the force of imagination, but later turns darker, as fascination with the idea of Tlön begins to distract people from paying adequate attention to the reality of Earth.

Much of the story engages with the philosophical idealism of George Berkeley, who questioned whether it is possible to say that a thing exists if it is not being perceived. (Berkeley, a philosopher and, later, a bishop in the Protestant Church of Ireland, resolved that question to his own satisfaction by saying that the omnipresent perception of God ensures that objects continue to exist outside of personal or human perception.) Berkeley&#x27;s philosophy privileges perceptions over any notion of the &quot;thing in itself.&quot; Immanuel Kant accused Berkeley of going so far as to deny objective reality.

In the imagined world of Tlön, an exaggerated Berkeleyan idealism &quot;without God&quot; passes for common sense. The Tlönian recognizes perceptions as primary and denies the existence of any underlying reality. At the end of the main portion of the story, immediately before the postscript, Borges stretches this toward its logical breaking point by imagining that, &quot;Occasionally a few birds, a horse perhaps, have saved the ruins of an amphitheater&quot; by continuing to perceive it. Besides commenting on Berkeley&#x27;s philosophy, this and other aspects of Borges&#x27;s story can be taken as a commentary on the ability of ideas to influence reality. For example, in Tlön there are objects known as &quot;hrönir&quot; that arise when two different people find the &quot;same&quot; lost object in different places.

Borges imagines a Tlönite working his way out of the problem of solipsism by reasoning that if all people are actually aspects of one being, then perhaps the universe is consistent because that one being is consistent in his imagining. This is, effectively, a near-reconstruction of the Berkeleyan God: perhaps not omnipresent, but bringing together all perceptions that do, indeed, occur.

This story is not the only place where Borges engages with Berkeleyan idealism. In the world of Tlön, as in Borges&#x27;s essay &quot;New refutation of time&quot; (1947), there is (as Emir Rodríguez Monegal and Alastair Reid comment) a &quot;denial of space, time, and the individual I.&quot; This worldview does not merely &quot;bracket off&quot; objective reality, but also parcels it separately into all its successive moments. Even the continuity of the individual self is open to question.

When Borges writes &quot;The metaphysicians of Tlön are not looking for truth or even an approximation to it: they are after a kind of amazement. They consider metaphysics a branch of fantastic literature,&quot; he can be seen either as anticipating the extreme relativism that underlies some postmodernism or simply as taking a swipe at those who take metaphysics too seriously.

===Literary themes===
In the context of the imagined world of Tlön, Borges describes a school of literary criticism that arbitrarily assumes that two works are by the same person and, based on that, deduces things about the imagined author. This is similar to the ending of &quot;Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote&quot;, in which Borges&#x27;s narrator suggests that a new perspective can be opened by treating a book as though it were written by a different author.

The story also plays with the theme of the love of books in general, and of encyclopedias and atlases in particular—books that are each themselves, in some sense, a world.

Like many of Borges&#x27;s works, the story challenges the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction. It mentions several quite real historical human beings (himself, his friend Bioy Casares, Thomas de Quincey, et al.) but often attributes fictional aspects to them; the story also contains many fictional characters and others whose factuality may be open to question.

===Other themes===
&quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; also engages a number of other related themes. The story begins and ends with issues of reflection, replication, and reproduction—both perfect and imperfect—and the related issue of the power of language and ideas to make or remake the world.

At the start of the story, we have an &quot;unnerving&quot; and &quot;grotesque&quot; mirror reflecting the room, a &quot;literal if inadequate&quot; (and presumably plagiarized) reproduction of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, an apt misquotation by Bioy Casares, and the issue of whether one should be able to trust whether the various copies of a single book will have the same content. At the end Borges is working on a &quot;tentative translation&quot; of an English-language work into Spanish, while the power of the ideas of &quot;a scattered dynasty of solitaries&quot; remakes the world in the image of Tlön.

Along the way we have stone mirrors; the idea of reconstructing an entire encyclopedia of an imaginary world based on a single volume; the analogy of that encyclopedia to a &quot;cosmos&quot; governed by &quot;strict laws&quot;; a worldview in which our normal notions of &quot;thing&quot; are rejected, but &quot;ideal objects abound, invoked and dissolved momentarily, according to poetic necessity&quot;; the universe conceived as &quot;the handwriting of a minor god to communicate with a demon&quot; or a &quot;code system... in which not all symbols have meaning&quot;; &quot;hrönir&quot;, duplicates of objects called into existence by ignorance or hope, and where &quot;those of the eleventh degree have a purity of form that the originals do not possess&quot;; and Ezra Buckley&#x27;s wish &quot;to demonstrate to a nonexistent God that mortal men were capable of conceiving a world.&quot;

Borges also mentions in passing the duodecimal system (as well as others). This ties into his description of Tlön&#x27;s arithmetic, which emphasizes indefinite numbers, and holds that a number does not actually have any value or independent existence until it is counted/named. However, some may see the reference to the duodecimal system as inherently refuting of the changeability of things due to nomenclature—a number may be renamed under a different counting schema, but the underlying value will always remain the same.

==Fact and fiction==

It is by no means simple to sort out fact and fiction within this story. The picture is further complicated by the fact that other authors (both in print and on the web) have chosen to join Borges in his game and write about one or another fictional aspect of this story either as if it were non-fiction or in a manner that could potentially confuse the unwary reader. One online example is the Italian-language website &quot;La Biblioteca di Uqbar&quot;, which treats Tlön itself as duly fictional, but writes as if the fictional Silas Haslam&#x27;s entirely imaginary &quot;History of the Land Called Uqbar&quot; were a real work.

As a result, simply finding a reference to a person or place from &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; in a context seemingly unrelated to Borges&#x27;s story is not enough to be confident that the person or place is real. See, for example, the discussion below of the character Silas Haslam.

There in fact exists an &quot;Anglo-American Encyclopedia&quot;, which is a plagiarism, differently paginated, of the tenth edition of the Encyclopedia, and in which the 46th volume is &quot;TOT-UPS&quot;, ending on p. 917 with Upsala, and followed by Ural–Altaic in the next volume; Uqbar would fall in between. In the &quot;11th&quot; edition of the &quot;Britannica&quot;, Borges&#x27;s favorite, there is an article in between these on &quot;Ur&quot;; which may, in some sense, therefore &quot;be&quot; Uqbar. Different articles in the 11th edition mention that &quot;Ur&quot;, as the name of a city, means simply &quot;&quot;the&quot; city&quot;, and that &quot;Ur&quot; is also the aurochs, or the evil god of the Mandaeans. Borges may be punning on the sense of &quot;primaeval&quot; here with his repeated use of &quot;Ursprache&quot;, or on the story&#x27;s own definition of &quot;ur&quot; in one of Tlön&#x27;s languages as &quot;a thing produced by suggestion, an object elicited by hope&quot;.

===Levels of reality===
There are several levels of reality (or unreality) in the story:

* Most (but not all) of the people mentioned in the story are real, but the events in which they are involved are mostly fictional, as are some of the works attributed to them. This is discussed in detail in the section below on real and fictional people.
* The main portion of the story is a fiction set in a naturalistic world; in the postscript, magical elements have entered the narrator&#x27;s world. The main portion could certainly be seen as a false document; the postscript may dissolve the illusion.
* The land of Uqbar is fictional from the point of view of the world of the story. The supposed &quot;Anglo-American Cyclopaedia&quot; article on Uqbar proves, within the story, to be a fictitious entry.
* Mlejnas, and Tlön as it is first introduced, are fictional from the point of view of Uqbar. In the course of the story, Tlön becomes more and more &quot;real&quot;: first it moves from being a fiction of Uqbar to being a fiction of the narrator&#x27;s own naturalistic world, then it begins (first as idea and then physically) taking over that world, to the point of finally threatening to annihilate normal reality.

===Real and fictional places===

Uqbar in the story is &quot;doubly&quot; fictional: even within the world of the story it turns out to be a fictional place. The fictitious entry described in the story furnishes deliberately meager indications of Uqbar&#x27;s location: &quot;Of the fourteen names which figured in the geographical part, we only recognized three – Khorasan, Armenia, Erzerum – interpolated in the text in an ambiguous way.&quot; Armenia and Erzerum lie in the eastern highlands of Asia Minor (in and near modern Turkey, perhaps corresponding to Urartu), while Khorasan is in northeastern Iran, though there is also a Horasan in eastern Turkey. However, it was said to have cited an equally nonexistent German-titled book – &quot;Lesbare und lesenswerthe Bemerkungen über das Land Ukkbar in Klein-Asien&quot; (&quot;Legible and valuable observations about the land of Uqbar in Asia Minor&quot;) – whose title claims unambiguously that Uqbar was in Asia Minor.

The boundaries of Uqbar were described using equally nonexistent reference points; for instance, &quot;the lowlands of Tsai Khaldun and the Axa Delta marked the southern frontier&quot;. This would suggest that the rivers of Borges&#x27; Uqbar should rise in highlands to the north; in fact, the mountainous highlands of eastern Turkey are where not one but two Zab Rivers rise, the Great Zab and the Lesser Zab. They run a couple of hundred miles south into the Tigris.

The only points of Uqbar&#x27;s history mentioned relate to religion, literature, and craft. It was described as the home of a noted heresiarch, and the scene of religious persecutions directed against the orthodox in the thirteenth century; fleeing the latter, its orthodox believers built obelisks in their southerly place of exile, and made mirrors – seen by the heresiarch as abominable – of stone. Crucially for the story, Uqbar&#x27;s &quot;epics and legends never referred to reality, but to the two imaginary regions of Mlejnas and Tlön.&quot;

Although the culture of Uqbar described by Borges is fictional, there are two real places with similar names. These are:

# The medieval city of ‘Ukbarâ on the left bank of the Tigris between Samarra and Baghdad in what is now Iraq. This city was home to the great Islamic grammarian, philologist, and religious scholar Al-‘Ukbarî (c. 1143–1219) – who was blind, like Borges&#x27;s father and like Borges himself was later to become – and to two notable early Jewish/Karaite &quot;heresiarchs&quot; (see above), leaders of Karaite movements opposed to Anan ben David, Ishmael al-Ukbari and Meshwi al-Ukbari, mentioned in the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; of 1901–1906.
# ‘Uqbâr in the Atlas Mountains of Algeria; the minarets of the latter&#x27;s area might relate to the &quot;obelisks&quot; of Uqbar in the story.

&quot;Tsai Khaldun&quot; is undoubtedly a tribute to the great historian Ibn Khaldun, who lived in Andalusia for a while; his history focuses on North Africa and was probably a major source for Borges. Additionally, &quot;tsai&quot; most likely comes from Turkish &quot;çay&quot; which is an uncommon word for river.

===Real and fictional people===
Listed here in order of their appearance in the story:

* Jorge Luis Borges (1899–1986)—Author and first person narrator of the story.
* Adolfo Bioy Casares (1914–1999)—non-fictional, Argentinian fiction-writer, a friend and frequent collaborator of Borges.
* An unnamed &quot;heresiarch of Uqbar&quot; is credited for the statement that &quot;mirrors and copulation are abominable because they increase the number of men&quot;. This echoes Borges&#x27; own summary of the teachings of Al-Muqanna (d. ca. 783), a Persian prophet regarded by his orthodox Muslim contemporaries as a heresiarch. In the previously-published short story collection &quot;A Universal History of Infamy&quot;, Borges wrote the following as part of a summary of his message: &quot;The world we live in is a mistake, a clumsy parody. Mirrors and fatherhood, because they multiply and confirm the parody, are abominations.&quot;
* Justus Perthes (1749–1816)—non-fictional, 18th century founder of a German publishing firm that bears his name; undoubtedly, the story is accurate in implying the firm&#x27;s atlases do not mention Uqbar.
* Carl Ritter (1779–1859)—one of the founders of modern geography. In the story, Borges notes the absence of any mention of Uqbar in Ritter&#x27;s cartographic index &quot;Erdkunde&quot;. (In the story, only the surname is given.)
* Smerdis (d. 522 BC)—The story refers in passing to &quot;the impostor, Smerdis the Magician&quot;. After the death of the actual Smerdis (son of Cyrus the Great of Persia) a Magian priest named Gaumata successfully impersonated him for several months and ruled in his stead.
* Bernard Quaritch (1819–1899)—An actual nineteenth-century bookseller in London. The bookstore bearing his name still survives. In the story, his catalogues include Silas Haslam&#x27;s &quot;History of the Land Called Uqbar&quot;.
* Silas Haslam—Entirely fictional, but based on Borges&#x27; English ancestors. &quot;Haslam&quot; was Borges&#x27;s paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name. In the story, besides the 1874 &quot;History of the Land Called Uqbar&quot;, a footnote informs us that Haslam is also the author of &quot;A General History of Labyrinths&quot; (labyrinths as well as playfully fake literary references are a recurring theme in Borges&#x27;s work). Silas Haslam is an entirely fictional character. However, Haslam&#x27;s &quot;General History of Labyrinths&quot; has been cited twice in reputable, peer-reviewed scientific literature: in &quot;Complexity of two-dimensional patterns&quot;, by Kristian Lindgren, Christopher Moore, and Mats Nordahl (published in the June 1998 edition of the &quot;Journal of Statistical Physics&quot;) and &quot;Order parameter equations for front transitions: Nonuniformly curved fronts,&quot; by A. Hagberg and E. Meron (published in the November 15, 1998 issue of &quot;Physica D&quot;).
*Johannes Valentinus Andreä (1586–1654)—German theologian, and the real author of &quot;Chymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosencreutz anno 1459&quot; (&quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot;), one of the three founding works of the Rosicrucians, but not of the &quot;Lesbare und lesenswerthe Bemerkungen über das Land Ukkbar in Klein-Asien&quot; (&quot;Readable and worthwhile remarks about the country of Ukkbar in Asia Minor&quot;) attributed to him in this story.
* Thomas De Quincey (1785–1859)—best known for his autobiographical works &quot;Confessions of an English Opium-Eater&quot; and &quot;Lake Reminiscences&quot;. Mentioned in passing in the story (by his surname) for his ostensible (not independently verified) mention of Andreä.
* Carlos Mastronardi (1901–1976)—Argentinian writer, member of the Martín Fierro group (also known as Florida group), and a close friend of Borges. In the story, he finds a copy of the &quot;Anglo-American Cyclopaedia&quot; that omits the Uqbar pages.
* Herbert Ashe (d. 1937)—presumably fictional, based on one or more of Borges&#x27;s father&#x27;s English friends. He shares with Xul Solar (see below) an interest in the duodecimal numeral system (in which twelve is written as 10.)
* Néstor Ibarra, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada (1895–1964), and (Pierre) Drieu La Rochelle (1893–1945)—all historical, described in the story as engaged in a dispute over whether the discovery of &quot;A First Encyclopaedia of Tlön. Volume XI. Hlaer to Jangr&quot; implies the existence of the other volumes to which it makes references. Ibarra was a noted Argentinian poet (and Borges&#x27;s translator into French); Estrada, an Argentinian, was the author of, among other works, &quot;Muerte y transfiguración de Martín Fierro&quot; (&quot;Death and Transfiguration of Martín Fierro&quot;), a major commentary on Argentina&#x27;s most famous nineteenth century literary work. Drieu La Rochelle, who was to commit suicide after becoming infamous for his collaboration with the Nazis during the Occupation of France, was one of the few foreign contributors to &quot;Sur&quot;, Victoria Ocampo&#x27;s Argentine journal to which Borges was a regular contributor.
* Alfonso Reyes (1889–1959)—Mexican diplomat who served for a time in Argentina and was a mentor figure for young Borges. In the story, he proposes to recreate the missing volumes of &quot;A First Encyclopaedia of Tlön&quot;.
* The philosopher Leibniz (1646–1716) is mentioned in passing, and Hume (1711–1776) is mentioned for finding Berkeley &quot;unanswerable but thoroughly unconvincing.&quot;
* Bishop George Berkeley (1685–1753), a driving engine of the story, was the founder of the modern school of philosophical idealism.
* Xul Solar (1887–1963)—adopted name of Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari, Argentinian watercolorist, esotericist, and (presumably most relevant here) inventor of imaginary languages. In the real world a close associate of Borges and a member of the Florida group; in the story, he skillfully translates one of the languages of the Southern Hemisphere of Tlön.
* Alexius Meinong (1853–1920)—Austrian psychologist and philosopher, who wrote &quot;Gegenstandstheorie&quot; (&quot;The theory of objects&quot;), where he wrote at length about the notion of objects that exist only in our minds. He is referred to by his surname in the story; his theories are alluded to by way of explaining the languages of the northern hemisphere of Tlön. Presumably, Borges is acknowledging where he got the idea for this imaginary family of languages.
* Bertrand Russell (1872–1970)—British philosopher. In a footnote, the story refers (accurately) to his conjecture that (in Borges&#x27;s words) &quot;our planet was created a few moments ago, and provided with a humanity which &#x27;remembers&#x27; an illusory past.&quot;
* Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677)—Dutch / Portuguese Jewish philosopher, referred to in the story by his surname, and accurately paraphrased: &quot;Spinoza attributes to his inexhaustible divinity the attributes of extension and of thought.&quot;
* Similarly, the story&#x27;s use of the German-language phrase &quot;Philosophie des Als Ob&quot; refers to philosopher Hans Vaihinger (1852–1933), whose book of this name (first edition: 1911) puts forward the notion that some human concepts are simply useful fictions.
* The ancient Greek philosopher Zeno (490–430 BC) is accurately alluded to in the story for his paradoxes denying the possibility of motion, based on the indivisibility of time.
* The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), as with Meinong, is acknowledged, in this case for his &quot;Parerga und Paralipomena&quot;, which Borges (apparently falsely) claims parallels a Tlönist &quot;idealist pantheism&quot;. This is really the absolute idealism of Schopenhauer&#x27;s despised rival, Hegel (1770–1831), which was derived from Spinoza&#x27;s pantheism. Schopenhauer does not assert that there is only one subject and that this one subject is every being in the universe; on the contrary, he asserts that each individual observing animal is a unique subject, having its own point of view of the objects that it experiences. Presumably Borges&#x27;s related remark about preserving a psychological basis for the sciences is something of a joke on preserving a scientific basis for psychology.
* William Shakespeare (1564–1616)—English poet, playwright, and actor. Merely alluded to in the story, without fictional embellishment.
* Gunnar Erfjord is presumably not a real person. The name is a combination of Gunnar Lange and Berta Erfjord, parents of Argentinian author Norah Lange, another member of the Martín Fierro group. At the beginning of the postscript to the story, a letter from Gunnar Erfjord clears up the mystery of the &quot;benevolent secret society&quot; that devised Tlön. He is presumably also the &quot;Norwegian in Rio Grande do Sul&quot; mentioned early in the story.
* Charles Howard Hinton (1853–1907) was an eccentric British mathematician, associated with the theosophists; Borges later edited and wrote a prologue for a translation of Hinton&#x27;s &quot;scientific romances&quot;, and also alludes to him in the story &quot;There are More Things&quot;, in the &quot;Book of Sand&quot; (1975). In &quot;Tlön...&quot;, the letter from Gunnar Erfjord is found &quot;in a volume of Hinton&quot;, presumably invoked for his interest in extra dimensions and parallel worlds.
* George Dalgarno (1626–1687), seventeenth-century Scottish intellectual with an interest in linguistics, and inventor of a language for deaf mutes. He is alluded to by his last name as an early member (along with Berkeley) of the fictional secret society that sets in motion the story of the doubly fictional Uqbar (and the triply fictional Tlön).
* Ezra Buckley (d. 1848), the eccentric American benefactor who expands the scale of the Uqbarist enterprise to a full Tlönist encyclopedic undertaking, is entirely fictional. It has been conjectured that there is an allusion to Ezra Pound. His nationality and greater aspiration can also be a reference to American ambition.
* María Lidia Lloveras (1898–?)—Argentinian, married into an old French noble family, making her Princess Faucigny Lucinge. She lived in Buenos Aires and was a friend of Borges. In the story, under her royal title, she stumbles across one of the first objects from Tlön to appear in our world.
* Enrique Amorim (1900–1960)—Uruguayan novelist. In the story, along with Borges, he witnesses the Tlönic coins that have fallen from the pocket of a dead man.
* Francisco de Quevedo (1580–1645)—Baroque Spanish poet and picaresque novelist, is alluded to here simply for his writing style.
* Thomas Browne (1605–1682), seventeenth-century English physician and essayist, is indeed the author of &quot;Urn Burial&quot;, which at the end of the story the fictional Borges is translating, though without intent to publish.

==Context in Borges&#x27;s life and works==
&quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; formed part of a 1941 collection of stories called &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;.

At the time he wrote &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; in early 1940, Borges was little known outside of Argentina. He was working in a local public library in Buenos Aires and had certain local fame as a translator of works from English, French, and German, and as an &quot;avant-garde&quot; poet and essayist (having published regularly in widely read Argentinian periodicals such as &quot;El Hogar&quot;, as well as in many smaller magazines, such as Victoria Ocampo&#x27;s &quot;Sur&quot;, where &quot;Tlön...&quot; was originally published). In the previous two years, he had been through a great deal: his father had died in 1938, and on Christmas Eve 1938, Borges himself had suffered a severe head wound in an accident; during treatment for that wound, he nearly died of a blood infection.

For some time before his father&#x27;s death and his accident, Borges had been drifting toward writing fiction. His &quot;&quot; (&quot;Universal History of Infamy&quot;), published in 1935, used a baroque writing style and the techniques of fiction to tell the stories of seven historical rogues. These ranged from &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Dread Redeemer Lazarus Morell&quot;)—who promised liberty to slaves in the American South, but brought them only death—to &quot;El incivil maestro de ceremonias Kotsuké no Suké&quot; (&quot;The Insulting Master of Etiquette Kôtsuké no Suké&quot;), the story of the central figure in the Japanese &quot;Tale of the 47 Ronin&quot;, also known as Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka. Borges had also written a number of clever literary forgeries disguised as translations from authors such as Emanuel Swedenborg or from Don Juan Manuel&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Count Lucanor&quot;. Recovering from his head wound and infection, Borges decided it was time to turn to the writing of fiction as such.

Several of these fictions, notably &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; and &quot;Pierre Menard, autor del Quijote&quot; (&quot;Pierre Menard, Author of &quot;The Quixote&quot;&quot;, published 10 months earlier in &quot;Sur&quot;, and also included in &quot;&quot;), could only have been written by an experienced essayist. Both of these works apply Borges&#x27;s essayistic style to the largely imaginary subject matter. His massive erudition is as evident in these fictions as in any non-fictional essay in his body of works.

Buenos Aires was, at this time, a thriving intellectual center. While Europe was immersed in World War II, Argentina, and Buenos Aires in particular, flourished intellectually and artistically. (This situation was to change during the presidency of Juan Perón and the subsequent military governments, when many of Argentina&#x27;s leading intellectuals went into exile, something that Borges and most of his circle did not contemplate.)

Borges&#x27;s first volume of fiction failed to garner the literary prizes many in his circle expected for it. Victoria Ocampo dedicated a large portion of the July 1942 issue of &quot;Sur&quot; to a &quot;Reparation for Borges&quot;; numerous leading writers and critics from Argentina and throughout the Spanish-speaking world contributed writings to the project, which probably brought his work as much attention as a prize would have.

Over the next few decades &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; and Borges&#x27;s other fiction from this period formed a key part of the body of work that put Latin America on the international literary map. Borges was to become more widely known throughout the world as a writer of extremely original short stories than as a poet and essayist.

==Publication history==
&quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; originally appeared in Spanish in SUR in May 1940. The Spanish-language original was then published in book form in &quot;&quot; (later translated in English as &quot;The Book of Fantasy&quot;) —December 1940—, then in Borges&#x27;s 1941 collection &quot;El Jardín de senderos que se bifurcan&quot; (&quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;). That entire book was, in turn, included within &quot;Ficciones&quot; (1944), a much-reprinted book (15 editions in Argentina by 1971).

The first published English-language translation was by James E. Irby. It appeared in the April 1961 issue of &quot;New World Writing&quot;. The following year, Irby&#x27;s translation was included as the first piece in a diverse collection of Borges works entitled &quot;Labyrinths&quot;. Almost simultaneously, and independently, the piece was translated by Alastair Reid; Reid&#x27;s version was published in 1962 as part of a collaborative English-language translation of the entirety of &quot;Ficciones&quot;. The Reid translation is reprinted in &quot;Borges, a Reader&quot; (1981, ), p. 111–122. Quotations and page references in this article follow that translation.

It was a finalist for the &quot;Retro Hugo Award&quot; for Best Short Story from 1940 (in 2016). It is the first non-English work to be nominated in its original language rather than as a translation.

According to the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard, &quot;Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; is &quot;the best short story ever written.&quot;

==Influence on later works==
&quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; has inspired a number of real-world projects:

* &quot;Small Demons&quot;, a website that &quot;obsessively maps out cultural allusions found in books&quot;, was inspired by Borges, according to CEO Valla Vakili: &quot;The inspiration for the name comes from the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges, specifically a passage in his short story &#x27;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&#x27;. Borges writes, &#x27;The history of the universe… is the handwriting produced by a Minor god in order to communicate with a Demon.&#x27; I read that as, the history of the universe is all the stories ever told. Minor gods are the storytellers who rule the worlds of their stories. And the Demon is the force that drives the need for stories, the place where author and reader meet. I took &#x27;Minor&#x27; and &#x27;Demon&#x27; and from there, Small Demons.&quot;
* &quot;Prisoners of Uqbaristan&quot;, a short story by Chris Nakashima-Brown in which Borges himself appears, is heavily influenced by the philosophy of Tlön.
* &quot;Codex Seraphinianus&quot;, a mock encyclopedia by Luigi Serafini, describes a surreal world entirely in drawings, an invented alphabet, and a fictional language.
* Ummo, a hoax of more than one thousand pages of pictures and text in letter form, describes an extraterrestrial civilization and its contact with Earth. UFO researcher Jacques Vallée has specifically likened Ummo to &quot;Tlön, Uqbar ...&quot;.
* The Borges story directly inspired Grant Morrison&#x27;s creation of the cancerous and fictional city of Orqwith in the DC Comics series &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;. In the comic book storyline, a group of intellectuals uses a tactile, braille-like language to create a black book describing the city of Orqwith. As people on different planets encounter the book, it infects their worlds, overcoming them in the way a malignant tumor would. Thus different sections of the planets are sliced off, only to be replaced with Orqwith.
* Tlön is featured in the Marvel Comics series &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; by Ales Kot and Michael Walsh, as a chaotic dimension the villain M.O.D.O.K. plans to bring monstrosities from to destroy the Earth. A chain of people that created a communal mindspace based on negative emotions is used to open a gate to Tlön. The plan, ultimately carried by M.O.D.O.K.&#x27;s assistant Snapper, is thwarted by the Secret Avengers and M.O.D.O.K. himself. In the end of the storyline, one of the characters, a sentient bomb named Vladimir, is transported to Tlön, where he meets an unseen entity he initially identifies as &quot;Jorg--&quot; before being interrupted by the entity himself. The story &quot;Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&quot; is explicitly referenced by characters that investigated Tlön.
*In Ted Chiang&#x27;s story The Lifecycle of Software Objects, one of the virtual worlds mentioned is called Orbis Tertius.

<text>The Tragedy of Richard the Third, often shortened to Richard III, is a play by William Shakespeare, which depicts the Machiavellian rise to power and subsequent short reign of King Richard III of England. It was probably written . It is labelled a history in the First Folio, and is usually considered one, but it is sometimes called a tragedy, as in the quarto edition. &quot;Richard III&quot; concludes Shakespeare&#x27;s first tetralogy which also contains &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;, and &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;.

It is the second longest play in the Shakespearean canon and is the longest of the First Folio, whose version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, otherwise the longest, is shorter than its quarto counterpart. The play is often abridged for brevity, and peripheral characters removed. In such cases, extra lines are often invented or added from elsewhere to establish the nature of the characters&#x27; relationships. A further reason for abridgment is that Shakespeare assumed his audiences&#x27; familiarity with his &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays, frequently referring to them.

==Synopsis==

The play begins with Richard of Gloucester, the youngest brother of King Edward IV of England, describing Edward&#x27;s re-accession to the throne (implying the year is 1471, after the Battle of Tewkesbury):

Despite this new era of peace and joy, Richard is an ugly and unloved hunchback who is therefore &quot;determined to prove a villain&quot;. Due to a prophecy that &quot; of Edward&#x27;s heirs the murderer shall be&quot;, Richard and Edward&#x27;s brother Clarence (whose given name is George) is placed under arrest. (Edward interpreted the prophecy as referring to eorge, but it could just as easily refer to Richard of loucester.) Speaking to Clarence as he is escorted along to the Tower of London, Richard blames the queen, Elizabeth, and says that he will try to help Clarence. 

Richard describes to the audience his plot to marry Lady Anne, despite being responsible for the death of her father and her husband. Anne attends the corpse of the late king, Henry VI, lamenting. When Richard appears, Anne berates him and says that &quot;Henry&#x27;s wounds[...] bleed afresh&quot;. He confesses to murdering the king, saying her beauty motivated it, and she spits at him. He proclaims his feelings for her and offers his sword for her to kill him, but she drops it. He then offers to kill himself, but she instead accepts his ring unhappily (and, it is implied, marriage) as he promises to repent for the murder. Richard exults at having won her over and tells the audience that he will discard her once she has served his purpose.

The atmosphere at Edward&#x27;s court is poisonous. The established nobles are at odds with the upwardly mobile relatives of Elizabeth, a hostility fuelled by Richard&#x27;s machinations. Queen Margaret, Henry VI&#x27;s widow, returns, though banished, and she warns the squabbling nobles about Richard, cursing extensively. The nobles, all Yorkists, unite against this last Lancastrian and ignore her warnings.

Richard orders two murderers to assassinate Clarence. The murderers arrive at the Tower with a warrant and, while they ponder how to carry out the deed, Clarence wakes and pleads for his life, telling them to go to Richard, who will reward them better for having kept him alive. One of the murderers explains that Richard hates him and indeed sent them, before they stab Clarence and drown him in a butt of Malmsey wine (the year 1478).

The compacted nobles pledge absent enmities before Edward, and Elizabeth asks him to pardon his brother Clarence. Richard reveals that Clarence is dead on the king&#x27;s own orders. Edward, who is ill and near death, is much upset by this news, expecting the order of execution to have been stopped in time, and Richard openly blames those attending Edward. Edward soon dies, and Richard becomes Protector (1483). Several prominent officials in Edward&#x27;s court have been imprisoned. His two young boys, including the uncrowned Edward V, are coaxed by Richard into an extended stay at the Tower of London.

Assisted by his cousin Buckingham, Richard mounts a campaign to present himself as the true heir to the throne, pretending to be a modest and devout man with no pretensions to greatness. Edward&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain, who objects to Richard&#x27;s accession, is arrested and executed on a trumped-up charge of treason. Richard and Buckingham spread the rumour that Edward&#x27;s two sons are illegitimate and therefore have no rightful claims, assisted by certain allies. The other lords are thus cajoled into accepting Richard as king, despite the continued survival of his nephews (the Princes in the Tower).
Richard asks Buckingham to assassinate the princes, but Buckingham hesitates. Richard instead recruits an assassin who kills both children. When Richard denies Buckingham a promised land grant, Buckingham turns against Richard and defects to the side of Henry VI&#x27;s nephew, the Earl of Richmond, who is currently in exile. Richard has his eye on the young Elizabeth of York, Edward IV&#x27;s next remaining heir, and kills Lady Anne by poison so he can be free to woo this younger Elizabeth. Richard&#x27;s mother, the Duchess of York, and the older Elizabeth mourn the princes&#x27; deaths. As prophesied, Queen Elizabeth asks Queen Margaret for help in cursing Richard. Later, the Duchess applies this lesson and curses her only surviving son before fleeing. Richard asks Queen Elizabeth to help him win her daughter Elizabeth&#x27;s hand in marriage. She is not taken in by his eloquence, and stalls by saying that she will let him know her daughter&#x27;s answer in due course.

The increasingly paranoid Richard loses what popularity he had. He faces rebellions, led first by Buckingham and subsequently by Richmond&#x27;s invading forces. Buckingham is captured and executed. Both sides arrive for a final battle at Bosworth Field, prior to which Richard, asleep, is visited by the ghosts of his victims, each telling him to &quot;Despair and die&quot;. They likewise wish for Richmond&#x27;s victory. Richard wakes, screaming for Jesus, then realises that he is all alone and cannot even pity himself.

At the Battle of Bosworth Field (1485), Richmond&#x27;s stepfather Lord Stanley and his followers desert Richard, whereupon Richard calls for the execution of Stanley&#x27;s son: a young hostage. This does not happen, however, as the battle is in full swing, and Richard is at a disadvantage. Richard is unhorsed on the field, and cries out, &quot;A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse&quot;. Richmond kills Richard and claims the throne, becoming Henry VII.

==Date and text==

&quot;Richard III&quot; is believed to be one of Shakespeare&#x27;s earlier plays, preceded only by the three parts of &quot;Henry VI&quot; and perhaps &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and a handful of comedies. It is believed to have been written –1594. Although &quot;Richard III&quot; was entered into the Register of the Stationers&#x27; Company on 20 October 1597 by the bookseller Andrew Wise, who published the first Quarto (Q1) later that year (with printing done by Valentine Simmes), Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot;, which cannot have been written much later than 1592 (Marlowe died in 1593), is thought to have been influenced by it. A second Quarto (Q2) followed in 1598, printed by Thomas Creede for Andrew Wise, containing an attribution to Shakespeare on its title page. Q3 appeared in 1602, Q4 in 1605, Q5 in 1612, and Q6 in 1622, the frequency attesting to its popularity. The First Folio version followed in 1623.

The Folio is longer than the Quarto and contains some fifty additional passages amounting to more than two hundred lines. However, the Quarto contains some twenty-seven passages amounting to about thirty-seven lines that are absent from the Folio. The two texts also contain hundreds of other differences, including the transposition of words within speeches, the movement of words from one speech to another, the replacement of words with near-synonyms, and many changes in grammar and spelling.

At one time, it was thought that the Quarto represented a separate revision of the play by Shakespeare. However, since the Quarto contains many changes that can only be regarded as mistakes, it is now widely believed that the Quarto was produced by memorial reconstruction. It is thought likely that the Quarto was collectively produced by a company of actors remembering their lines. It is unknown why the actors did this, but it may have been to replace a missing prompt book. The Folio is regarded as having much higher authority than the Quarto, but because the Folio edition was collated by the printers against a Quarto (probably Q3), some errors from the Quarto found their way into the Folio. Some parts of the Folio (the beginning of Act III and much of Act V) are clearly copied, with little change, direct from the Quarto. The Folio also has its own corruptions and omissions, and corrections have to be supplied, where possible, from the Quarto.

==Themes==

===Comedic elements===
Unlike his previous tragedy &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, the play avoids graphic demonstrations of physical violence; only Richard and Clarence are shown being stabbed on-stage, while the rest (the two princes, Hastings, Brackenbury, Grey, Vaughan, Rivers, Anne, Buckingham, and King Edward) all meet their ends off-stage. Despite the villainous nature of the title character and the grim storyline, Shakespeare infuses the action with comic material, as he does with most of his tragedies. Much of the humour rises from the dichotomy between how Richard&#x27;s character is known and how Richard tries to appear.

Richard himself also provides some dry remarks in evaluating the situation, as when he plans to marry Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s daughter: &quot;Murder her brothers, then marry her; Uncertain way of gain ...&quot; Other examples of humour in this play include Clarence&#x27;s reluctant murderers, and the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s report on his attempt to persuade the Londoners to accept Richard (&quot;I bid them that did love their country&#x27;s good cry, God save Richard, England&#x27;s royal king!&quot; Richard: &quot;And did they so?&quot; Buckingham: &quot;No, so God help me, they spake not a word ...&quot;)
Puns, a Shakespearean staple, are especially well represented in the scene where Richard tries to persuade Queen Elizabeth to woo her daughter on his behalf.

===Free will and fatalism===

One of the central themes of &quot;Richard III&quot; is the idea of fate, especially as it is seen through the tension between free will and fatalism in Richard&#x27;s actions and speech, as well as the reactions to him by other characters. There is no doubt that Shakespeare drew heavily on Sir Thomas More&#x27;s account of Richard III as a criminal and tyrant as inspiration for his own rendering. This influence, especially as it relates to the role of divine punishment in Richard&#x27;s rule of England, reaches its height in the voice of Margaret. Janis Lull suggests that &quot;Margaret gives voice to the belief, encouraged by the growing Calvinism of the Elizabethan era, that individual historical events are determined by God, who often punishes evil with (apparent) evil&quot;.

Thus it seems possible that Shakespeare, in conforming to the growing &quot;Tudor Myth&quot; of the day, as well as taking into account new theologies of divine action and human will becoming popular in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, sought to paint Richard as the final curse of God on England in punishment for the deposition of Richard II in 1399. Irving Ribner argued that &quot;the evil path of Richard is a cleansing operation which roots evil out of society and restores the world at last to the God-ordained goodness embodied in the new rule of Henry VII&quot;.

Scholar Victor Kiernan writes that this interpretation is a perfect fit with the English social perspective of Shakespeare&#x27;s day: &quot;An extension is in progress of a privileged class&#x27;s assurance of preferential treatment in the next world as in this, to a favoured nation&#x27;s conviction of having God on its side, of Englishmen being ... the new Chosen People&quot;. 

However, historical fatalism is merely one side of the argument of fate versus free will. It is also possible that Shakespeare intended to portray Richard as &quot;a personification of the Machiavellian view of history as power politics&quot;. In this view, Richard is acting entirely out of his own free will in brutally taking hold of the English throne. Kiernan also presents this side of the coin, noting that Richard &quot;boasts to us of his finesse in dissembling and deception with bits of Scripture to cloak his &#x27;naked villainy&#x27; (I.iii.334–348) ... Machiavelli, as Shakespeare may want us to realise, is not a safe guide to practical politics&quot;.

Kiernan suggests that Richard is merely acting as if God is determining his every step in a sort of Machiavellian manipulation of religion as an attempt to circumvent the moral conscience of those around him. Therefore, historical determinism is merely an illusion perpetrated by Richard&#x27;s assertion of his own free will. The Machiavellian reading of the play finds evidence in Richard&#x27;s interactions with the audience, as when he mentions that he is &quot;determinèd to prove a villain&quot; (I.i.30). However, though it seems Richard views himself as completely in control, Lull suggests that Shakespeare is using Richard to state &quot;the tragic conception of the play in a joke. His primary meaning is that he controls his own destiny. His pun also has a second, contradictory meaning—that his villainy is predestined—and the strong providentialism of the play ultimately endorses this meaning&quot;.

Literary critic Paul Haeffner writes that Shakespeare had a great understanding of language and the potential of every word he used. One word that Shakespeare gave potential to was &quot;joy&quot;. This is employed in Act I, Scene III, where it is used to show &quot;deliberate emotional effect&quot;. Another word that Haeffner points out is &quot;kind&quot;, which he suggests is used with two different definitions.

The first definition is used to express a &quot;gentle and loving&quot; man, which Clarence uses to describe his brother Richard to the murderers that were sent to kill him. This definition is not true, as Richard uses a gentle façade to seize the throne. The second definition concerns &quot;the person&#x27;s true nature ... Richard will indeed use Hastings kindly—that is, just as he is in the habit of using people—brutally&quot;.

Haeffner also writes about how speech is written. He compares the speeches of Richmond and Richard to their soldiers. He describes Richmond&#x27;s speech as &quot;dignified&quot; and formal, while Richard&#x27;s speech is explained as &quot;slangy and impetuous&quot;. Richard&#x27;s casualness in speech is also noted by another writer. However, Lull does not make the comparison between Richmond and Richard as Haeffner does, but between Richard and the women in his life. However, it is important to the women share the formal language that Richmond uses. She makes the argument that the difference in speech &quot;reinforces the thematic division between the women&#x27;s identification with the social group and Richard&#x27;s individualism&quot;. Haeffner agrees that Richard is &quot;an individualist, hating dignity and formality&quot;.

Janis Lull also takes special notice of the mourning women. She suggests that they are associated with &quot;figures of repetition as anaphora—beginning each clause in a sequence with the same word—and epistrophe—repeating the same word at the end of each clause&quot;. One example of the epistrophe can be found in Margaret&#x27;s speech in Act I, Scene III. Haeffner refers to these as few of many &quot;devices and tricks of style&quot; that occur in the play, showcasing Shakespeare&#x27;s ability to bring out the potential of every word.

===Richard as anti-hero===
Throughout the play, Richard&#x27;s character constantly changes and shifts and, in doing so, alters the dramatic structure of the story.

Richard immediately establishes a connection with the audience with his opening monologue. In the soliloquy he admits his amorality to the audience but at the same time treats them as if they were co-conspirators in his plotting; one may well be enamored of his rhetoric while being appalled by his actions. Richard shows off his wit in Act I, as seen in the interchanges with Lady Anne (Act I, Scene II) and his brother Clarence (Act I, Scene I). In his dialogues in Act I, Richard knowingly refers to thoughts he has only previously shared with the audience to keep the audience attuned to him and his objectives. In 1.1, Richard tells the audience in a soliloquy how he plans to claw his way to the throne—killing his brother Clarence as a necessary step to get there. However, Richard pretends to be Clarence&#x27;s friend, falsely reassuring him by saying, &quot;I will deliver you, or else lie for you&quot; (1.1.115); which the audience knows—and Richard tells the audience after Clarence&#x27;s exit—is the exact opposite of what he plans to do. Scholar Michael E. Mooney describes Richard as occupying a &quot;figural position&quot;; he is able to move in and out of it by talking with the audience on one level, and interacting with other characters on another.

Each scene in Act I is book-ended by Richard directly addressing the audience. This action on Richard&#x27;s part not only keeps him in control of the dramatic action of the play, but also of how the audience sees him: in a somewhat positive light, or as the protagonist. Richard actually embodies the dramatic character of &quot;Vice&quot; from medieval morality plays—with which Shakespeare was very familiar from his time—with his &quot;impish-to-fiendish humour&quot;. Like Vice, Richard is able to render what is ugly and evil—his thoughts and aims, his view of other characters—into what is charming and amusing for the audience.

In the earlier acts of the play, too, the role of the antagonist is filled by that of the old Lancastrian queen, Margaret, who is reviled by the Yorkists and whom Richard manipulates and condemns in Act I, Scene III.

However, after Act I, the number and quality of Richard&#x27;s asides to the audience decrease significantly, as well as multiple scenes are interspersed that do not include Richard at all, but average Citizens (Act II, Scene III), or the Duchess of York and Clarence&#x27;s children (Act II, Scene II), who are as moral as Richard is evil. Without Richard guiding the audience through the dramatic action, the audience is left to evaluate for itself what is going on. In Act IV, Scene IV, after the murder of the two young princes and the ruthless murder of Lady Anne, the women of the play—Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of York, and even Margaret—gather to mourn their state and to curse Richard; and it is difficult as the audience not to sympathise with them. When Richard enters to bargain with Queen Elizabeth for her daughter&#x27;s hand—a scene whose form echoes the same rhythmically quick dialogue as the Lady Anne scene in Act I—he has lost his vivacity and playfulness for communication; it is obvious he is not the same man.

By the end of Act IV everyone else in the play, including Richard&#x27;s own mother, the Duchess, has turned against him. He does not interact with the audience nearly as much, and the inspiring quality of his speech has declined into merely giving and requiring information. As Richard gets closer to seizing the crown, he encloses himself within the world of the play; no longer embodying his facile movement in and out of the dramatic action, he is now stuck firmly within it. It is from Act IV that Richard really begins his rapid decline into truly being the antagonist. Shakespeare scholar Stephen Greenblatt notes how Richard even refers to himself as &quot;the formal Vice, Iniquity&quot; (3.1.82), which informs the audience that he knows what his function is; but also like Vice in the morality plays, the fates will turn and get Richard in the end, which Elizabethan audiences would have recognised.

In addition, the character of Richmond enters into the play in Act V to overthrow Richard and save the state from his tyranny, effectively being the instantaneous new protagonist. Richmond is a clear contrast to Richard&#x27;s evil character, which makes the audience see him as such.

==Performance==

The earliest certain performance occurred on 1633, when Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria watched it on the Queen&#x27;s birthday.
Colley Cibber produced the most successful of the Restoration adaptations of Shakespeare with his version of &quot;Richard III&quot;, at Drury Lane starting in 1700. Cibber himself played the role till 1739, and his version was on stage for the next century and a half. It contained the lines &quot;Off with his head; so much for Buckingham&quot; – possibly the most famous Shakespearean line that Shakespeare did not write – and &quot;Richard&#x27;s himself again!&quot;. The original Shakespearean version returned in a production at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in 1845.

In 2011 film actor Kevin Spacey starred in an Old Vic production which subsequently toured the United States, directed by stage and film director Sam Mendes. Spacey had played the role of Richard&#x27;s henchman, the Duke of Buckingham, in the Pacino film.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
Basil Rathbone played Richard III in the 1939 Universal horror film &quot;Tower of London&quot;, which was directed by Rowland V. Lee. The film was later remade by Roger Corman in 1962 with Vincent Price (who had played Clarence in Lee&#x27;s film) in the lead role. While both films are influenced by the characterisation and structure of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, neither includes any dialogue from it.

The most famous player of the part in recent times was Laurence Olivier in his 1955 film version. Olivier&#x27;s film incorporates a few scenes and speeches from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; and Cibber&#x27;s rewrite of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, but cuts entirely the characters of Queen Margaret and the Duchess of York, and Richard&#x27;s soliloquy after seeing the ghosts of his victims. Olivier has Richard seduce Lady Anne while mourning over the corpse of her husband rather than her father-in-law as in the play. Olivier&#x27;s rendition has been parodied by many comedians, including Peter Cook and Peter Sellers. Sellers, who had aspirations to do the role straight, appeared in a 1965 TV special on the Beatles&#x27; music by reciting &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; in the style of Olivier&#x27;s Richard III. The first episode of the BBC television comedy &quot;Blackadder&quot; in part parodies the Olivier film, visually (as in the crown motif), Peter Cook&#x27;s performance as a benevolent Richard, and by mangling Shakespearean text (&quot;Now is the summer of our sweet content made o&#x27;ercast winter by these Tudor clouds ...&quot;)

Richard Loncraine&#x27;s 1995 film, starring Ian McKellen, is set in a fictional fascist England in the 1930s, and based on an earlier highly successful stage production. Only about half the text of the play is used. The first part of his &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent...&quot; soliloquy is a public speech, while the second part is a private monologue. The famous final line of Richard&#x27;s &quot;A horse, my kingdom for a horse&quot; is spoken when his jeep becomes trapped after backing up into a large pile of rubble.

In 1996, Al Pacino made his directoral debut and played the title role in &quot;Looking for Richard&quot;, analysing the plot of the play and playing out several scenes from it, as well as conducting a broader examination of Shakespeare&#x27;s continuing role and relevance in popular culture. Also in 1996, a pristine print of &quot;Richard III&quot; (1912), starring Frederick Warde in the title role, was discovered by a private collector and donated to the American Film Institute. The 55-minute film is considered to be the earliest surviving American feature film.

In the out-take interviews of the 1983 Brian De Palma classic Scarface, writer Oliver Stone indicated that his pre-script influences had included William Shakespeare&#x27;s Richard III. 

In 2002 the story of Richard III was re-told in a movie about gang culture called &quot;King Rikki&quot; (also known as &quot;The Street King&quot;).

In 2017, Italian director Roberta Torre realized a musical drama film, inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s play, named &quot;Bloody Richard&quot;.

===Television===
The BBC Television Shakespeare version, first broadcast in 1983, starred Ron Cook as Richard.

BBC Two aired a new adaptation of &quot;Richard III&quot; in 2016 as part of &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; series, with Benedict Cumberbatch playing the king. Executive producer Pippa Harris commented, &quot;By filming the &quot;Henry VI&quot; plays as well as &quot;Richard III&quot;, we will allow viewers to fully appreciate how such a monstrous tyrant could find his way to power, bringing even more weight and depth to this iconic character.&quot;

==In culture==

===&quot;Now is the winter of our discontent&quot;===
The 2010 film, &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot;, features a scene where the king&#x27;s speech therapist Lionel Logue, as played by Geoffrey Rush, auditions for the role by reciting the lines, &quot;Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this sun [or son] of York&quot;. Shakespeare critic Keith Jones believes that the film in general sets up its main character as a kind of antithesis to Richard III. The same antithesis was noted by conservative commentator Noah Millman.

In the &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; episode &quot;Marooned&quot;, Rimmer objects to Lister&#x27;s burning of the &quot;Complete Works of Shakespeare&quot; in an attempt to maintain enough heat to keep him alive. When challenged, Rimmer claims he can quote from it and embarks upon the soliloquy: &quot;Now! ... That&#x27;s all I can remember. You know! That famous speech from &quot;Richard III&quot; – &#x27;now, something something something something&#x27;.&quot;

In the 1967 film &quot;Billion Dollar Brain&quot;, Harry Palmer is told to use the verse as a code phrase.

John Steinbeck used the opening line for the title of his novel &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Winter of Discontent&quot; is an expression, popularised by the British media, referring to the winter of 1978–79 in the United Kingdom, during which there were widespread strikes by local authority trade unions demanding larger pay rises for their members.

===&quot;My kingdom for a horse!&quot;===
Richard begins act 5, scene 4 by exclaiming &quot;A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!&quot; after being knocked from his steed during the climactic battle. illustrates the drama and desperation of his sudden fall from grace and has entered common parlance as such.

In the 1949 Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;A Ham in a Role&quot;, the dog actor says Catesby and Richard III&#x27;s lines, &quot;Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost! A horse, A horse, My kingdom for a horse!&quot; before being kicked out of the window by a Goofy Gophers-hauled horse.

Noël Coward&#x27;s 1941 song &quot;Could You Please Oblige Us with a Bren Gun?&quot; includes a lyric referring to Colonel Montmorency: &quot;He realised his army should be mechanised, of course/ But somewhere inside/ Experience cried/ &#x27;My kingdom for a horse!

In the 1993 Mel Brooks film &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot;, the character Robin of Locksley, played by Cary Elwes, says &quot;A horse, my kingdom for a horse!&quot; as he arrives in England in the opening scene.

In E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s 1816 story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, the Nutcracker shouts in one scene; &quot;A horse – a horse – my kingdom for a horse!&quot;

===Other quotations===
The film &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; has many Shakespeare allusions, including a scene in which Malkovich is shown rehearsing &quot;Richard III&quot; lines &quot;Was ever woman in this humour woo&#x27;d? / Was ever woman in this humour won?&quot; where Richard is boasting about using power, lies, and crime to seduce Lady Anne. As Visual Cultures professor Lynn Turner notes, this scene anticipates a parallel scene in which Craig uses deceit to seduce Maxine through Malkovich. Mariangela Tempera has noted that the subservience of Lady Anne in the scene contrasts with the self-assertiveness of the actress playing Lady Anne as she seduces Malkovich offstage.

In Adam Sandler&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Jack and Jill&quot;, Al Pacino reprises his role as Richard III, although the scenes are modified as Pacino interacts with the audience in a heavily comedic way.

In &quot; V for Vendetta&quot; when V confronts Father Lilliman, he quotes the line &quot;And thus I clothe my naked villany in old odd ends stol&#x27;n forth of holy writ, and seem a saint when most I play the devil.&quot;

In &quot;Freaked&quot;, an arrogant movie star who has been transformed into a &quot;hideous mutant freak&quot; makes use of his deformity by performing the opening soliloquy, condensed by a local professor in subtitles for the &quot;culturally illiterate&quot; to the more succinct &quot;I&#x27;m ugly. I never get laid.&quot; One reviewer mentioned this as the best example of how the film seamlessly moves between highbrow and lowbrow culture.

In &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;, an ambitious actor played by Richard Dreyfuss is forced by his off-Broadway producer to play Richard III as a caricature of a homosexual.

In the 1975 film &quot;L&#x27;important c&#x27;est d&#x27;aimer&quot;, directed by Andrzej Żuławski, a production of &quot;Richard III&quot; in French is a &quot;mise en abyme&quot; for the drama enveloping the characters in the film.

The manga &quot;Requiem of the Rose King&quot; by Aya Kanno, which began in 2013, is a loose adaptation of the first Shakespearean historical tetralogy. It depicts Richard III as intersex instead of hunchbacked.

The title of the Alistair MacLean film &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; is inspired by Richard&#x27;s complaint that the &quot;world is grown so bad, that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.&quot; (Quoted in Act I, Scene III)

====Lincoln&#x27;s assassination====
US President Abraham Lincoln was renowned for his love of Shakespeare, and of &quot;Richard III&quot; in particular. This fed Confederate propaganda, especially in Virginia, where residents of Richmond, Virginia, saw Lincoln as a Richard-like tyrant and identified their capital city with the Earl of Richmond, the hero of Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Some interpreted Richard&#x27;s Act IV speech as an omen favourable to the South:
Within a fortnight of the president&#x27;s visit to the defeated city, he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Shakespearean actor known for playing both Richard and Richmond. Booth&#x27;s notorious final words from the stage were &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot;&quot;.

==Historical inaccuracy==
Shakespeare, and the Tudor chroniclers who influenced him, had an interest in portraying the defeat of the Plantagenet House of York by the House of Tudor as good conquering evil. Loyalty to the new regime required that the last Plantagenet king, Richard III, be depicted as a villain. The historical inaccuracies in the play can be attributed partly to Shakespeare&#x27;s sources, such as &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot;, the writings of John Rous, Polydore Vergil and Thomas More, and partly to artistic licence. Some of these inaccuracies are listed below in the order in which they either appear or are referred to in the play.

There is no evidence to suggest that Richard was personally responsible for the death of his wife&#x27;s first husband, Edward of Westminster (the son of Henry VI), nor that of her father, the Earl of Warwick (and in &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; Richard is not portrayed as being responsible for Warwick&#x27;s death). Richard, then eighteen, took part in the battles in which Edward and Warwick were killed. Shakespeare&#x27;s sources do not identify Richard as being involved in the death of Henry VI, who was probably murdered on the orders of Edward IV. Richard and his wife, Anne Neville, had known each other for a long time before they married, having spent much of their childhood in the same household. Henry VI&#x27;s widow, Queen Margaret, was not at court in the period covered by this play; she became Edward IV&#x27;s prisoner and returned to France in 1475. Richard&#x27;s elder brother, Clarence (George, Duke of Clarence), was not on good terms with Richard, but was imprisoned by Edward IV and was executed for treason in 1478, when Richard was in the North of England, where he continued to live until Edward IV died five years later.

Richard returned from the North to fulfil Edward IV&#x27;s wish that he rule as Lord Protector. It was the Plantagenet tradition that a future king (in this case Edward V, the elder of the &quot;princes in the tower&quot;) would stay in the royal apartments at the Tower of London while awaiting his coronation. No one knows why the &quot;princes in the tower&quot; disappeared or what happened to them. Richard took the throne by an Act of Parliament, on the basis of testimony claiming that Edward IV&#x27;s marriage to Queen Elizabeth (Elizabeth Woodville) had been bigamous. Contemporary rumours that Richard had murdered his own wife appear baseless; she is thought to have died of tuberculosis. There is no surviving evidence to suggest that he planned to marry his niece, Elizabeth of York, although rumours about this plan did circulate. At the time he was also negotiating a marriage for Elizabeth with a Portuguese prince, Manuel, Duke of Beja (later Manuel I of Portugal).

At the Battle of Bosworth there was no single combat between Richard and Richmond (Henry Tudor). Richard spotted Richmond in his rearguard surrounded by French pikemen and led a cavalry charge against him. Richard was steered away from Richmond by Sir Rhys ap Thomas. The Stanleys (Thomas, Lord Stanley, and his younger brother, Sir William Stanley) entered the fray in support of Richmond when they saw that Richard was vulnerable; when he saw this, Richard cried &quot;Treason&quot;. Richard fell from his horse after it lost its footing in a marshy area; he was offered a new horse but declined. 

The only contemporary reference to Richard having any deformities was the observation that his right shoulder was slightly higher than his left, which is now known to have been caused by his scoliosis of the spine. After the discovery of Richard&#x27;s remains in 2012 it became clear that he might have been slightly hunched, though the degree and direction of the curvature was not as serious as that of what is now known as spinal kyphosis.

<doc id="176964" wikidata="Q1146554" url="?curid=176964" title="Diode bridge">
<text>A diode bridge is a bridge rectifier circuit of four diodes that is used in the process of converting alternating current (AC) from the input terminals to direct current (DC, i.e. fixed polarity) on the output terminals. Its function is to convert the negative voltage portions of the AC waveform to positive voltage, after which a low-pass filter can be used to smooth the result into DC.

When used in its most common application, for conversion of an alternating-current (AC) input into a direct-current (DC) output, it is known as a bridge rectifier. A bridge rectifier provides full-wave rectification from a two-wire AC input, resulting in lower cost and weight as compared to a rectifier with a three-wire input from a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding.

Prior to the availability of integrated circuits, a bridge rectifier was constructed from separate diodes. Since about 1950, a single four-terminal component containing the four diodes connected in a bridge configuration has been available and is now available with various voltage and current ratings.

Diodes are also used in bridge topologies along with capacitors as voltage multipliers.

== History ==
The diode bridge circuit was invented by Karol Pollak and patented in December 1895 in Great Britain and in January 1896 in Germany. In 1897, Leo Graetz independently invented and published a similar circuit. Today the circuit is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Graetz circuit&quot; or &quot;Graetz bridge&quot;.
== Current flow==
According to the conventional model of current flow, originally established by Benjamin Franklin and still followed by most engineers today), current flows through electrical conductors from the positive to the negative pole (defined as positive flow). In actuality, free electrons in a conductor nearly always flow from the negative to the positive pole. In the vast majority of applications, however, the actual direction of current flow is irrelevant. Therefore, in the discussion below the conventional model is retained.

The fundamental characteristic of a diode is that current can flow only one way through it, which is defined as the forward direction. A diode bridge uses diodes as series components to allow current to pass in the forward direction during the positive part of the AC cycle and as shunt components to redirect current flowing in the reverse direction during the negative part of the AC cycle to the opposite rails.

== Rectifier ==
In the diagrams below, when the input connected to the left corner of the diamond is positive, and the input connected to the right corner is negative, current flows from the upper supply terminal to the right along the red (positive) path to the output and returns to the lower supply terminal through the blue (negative) path.

When the input connected to the left corner is negative, and the input connected to the right corner is positive, current flows from the lower supply terminal to the right along the red (positive) path to the output and returns to the upper supply terminal through the blue (negative) path.

In each case, the upper right output remains positive, and lower right output negative. Since this is true whether the input is AC or DC, this circuit not only produces a DC output from an AC input, it can also provide reverse-polarity protection; that is, it permits normal functioning of DC-powered equipment when batteries have been installed backwards, or when the leads from a DC power source have been reversed, and protects the equipment from potential damage caused by reverse polarity.

Alternatives to the diode-bridge full-wave rectifiers are the center-tapped transformer and double-diode rectifier, and voltage doubler rectifier using two diodes and two capacitors in a bridge topology.

== Smoothing circuits ==
With AC input, the output of a diode bridge (called a full-wave rectifier for this purpose; there is also half-wave rectification, which does not use a diode bridge) is polarized pulsating non-sinusoidal voltage of the same amplitude but twice the frequency of the input. It may be considered as DC voltage upon which is superimposed a very large ripple voltage. This kind of electric power is not very usable, because ripple is dissipated as waste heat in DC circuit components and may cause noise or distortion during circuit operation. So nearly all rectifiers are followed by a series of bandpass or bandstop filters and/or a voltage regulator to convert most or all of the ripple voltage into a smoother and possibly higher DC output. A filter may be as simple as a single sufficiently large capacitor or choke, but most power-supply filters have multiple alternating series and shunt components. When the ripple voltage rises, reactive power is stored in the filter components, reducing the voltage; when the ripple voltage falls, reactive power is discharged from the filter components, raising the voltage. The final stage of rectification may consist of a zener diode-based voltage regulator, which almost completely eliminates any residual ripple.

== Polyphase diode bridges ==

The diode bridge can be generalized to rectify polyphase AC inputs. For example, for a three-phase AC input, a half-wave rectifier consists of three diodes, but a full-wave bridge rectifier consists of six diodes.

A half-wave rectifier may be considered a wye connection (star connection), because it returns the current through the center (neutral) wire. A full-wave rectifier is more like a delta connection, although it can be connected to the three-phase source of either wye or delta and it does not use the center (neutral) wire.

<doc id="176965" wikidata="Q91282" url="?curid=176965" title="Arkanoid">
<text>is a 1986 block breaker arcade game developed and published by Taito. In North America, it was published by Romstar. Controlling a paddle-like craft known as the Vaus, the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the bottom edge of the playfield. Some blocks contain power-ups that have various effects, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, creating several additional balls, or equipping the Vaus with cannons. Other blocks may be indestructible or require multiple hits to break.

Created by Taito designers Akira Fujita and Hiroshi Tsujino, &quot;Arkanoid&quot; expanded on the concept established in Atari, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Breakout&quot;, a successful game in its own right that was met with a large wave of similar clone games from other manufacturers. It was part of a contest within Taito, where two teams of designers had to complete a block breaker game and determine which one was superior to the other. The film &quot;Tron&quot; served as inspiration for the game&#x27;s futuristic, neon aesthetic. Level designs were sketched on paper before being programmed and tested to make sure they were fun to play. The enemy and power-up designs were 3D models converted into sprite art.

Early location tests for &quot;Arkanoid&quot; surpassed Taito&#x27;s initial expectations. It became a major commercial success in arcades, becoming the highest-grossing table arcade cabinet of 1987 in Japan and the year&#x27;s highest-grossing conversion kit in the United States. The game was commended by critics for its gameplay, simplicity, addictive nature, and improvements over the original &quot;Breakout&quot; concept. The game revitalized the genre and set the groundwork for many games to follow. &quot;Arkanoid&quot; was ported to many home video game platforms, including the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, ZX Spectrum, and (years later) mobile phones, and it spawned a long series of sequels and updates over the course of two decades.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Arkanoid&quot; is a block breaker video game. Its plot involves the starship Arkanoid being attacked by a mysterious entity from space named DOH. A small paddle-shaped craft, the Vaus, is ejected from the Arkanoid.

The player controls the Vaus, moving it from side to side in order to hit a ball into a pattern of bricks and destroy them. After all bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to the next level and faces a new pattern. Most bricks can be destroyed in one hit; some require multiple hits, and others cannot be destroyed at all. Some bricks release capsules that bestow various power-ups when caught, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, temporarily slowing the ball down, or granting an extra life. Floating enemies/obstacles emerge onto the screen at times and can be hit for bonus points.

On the final stage (33 on most versions, but 36 on the NES), the player takes on the game&#x27;s boss, &quot;DOH&quot;. Once this point is reached, the player no longer has the option to continue after running out of lives, making this segment more difficult. The game is over regardless of the outcome.

If the player succeeds in defeating &quot;DOH&quot;, the game rewards them by showing the ending, in which time starts to flow backwards, and Vaus escapes the distorted space just in time to return to the Arkanoid, which has also reversed back to perfect condition. The game&#x27;s text warns, however, that the journey has only started, and that the player has not seen the last of &quot;DOH&quot;.

==Development and release==

&quot;Arkanoid&quot; was designed by Akira Fujita and Hiroshi &quot;ONIJUST&quot; Tsujino, both of whom were members of Taito&#x27;s Yokohama Research Institute. The company&#x27;s sales department requested a new block breaker arcade game due to the genre beginning to see an upturn in popularity, following a steady downfall in the early 1980s. This led to a competition being held within the company to design the new game which was jointly won by Fujita and Tsujino, who were then instructed to combine their ideas into a single project. The game builds on the overall block breaker concept established in Atari&#x27;s &quot;Breakout&quot;, a widely-successful arcade game that spawned a long series of similar clone games by other manufacturers.

The development team consisted of Fujita in charge of planning, with Tsujino providing level design and graphics and two others programming the arcade board, a modified version of the Taito Classic hardware. The neon, futuristic aesthetic was inspired by the film &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), which Tsujino was a big fan of. Blocks originally never had colors and were simply the same color, which was changed to the minor annoyance of Tsujino. The various geometric-like enemies and power-up items were hand-drawn from 3-dimensional models before being converted into sprite art. Hisayoshi Ogura, the founder of Taito&#x27;s &quot;house band&quot; Zuntata, created the game&#x27;s music.

The game had a short development time with tight work deadlines, a schedule which Tsujino has since claimed to be &quot;murderous&quot;. Location testing for the game began only a month after the start of development. It was incredibly well received by playtesters, and generated a lot more popularity and income than Taito had expected. &quot;Arkanoid&quot; was officially released in Japan in July 1986, and in North America later that year by distributor company Romstar.

==Ports==
&quot;Arkanoid&quot; was ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, BBC Micro, MSX, Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, NES, Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS. and IBM PC compatibles. A Mac version was released in 1987 and a port was released for the Tandy Color Computer 3 in 1989. Computer conversions were published by Imagine. The NES and MSX ports were packaged with a custom controller.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
&quot;Arkanoid&quot; became one of Taito&#x27;s most profitable coin-operated games. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed it as being the most popular arcade game of August 1986, and it remained the top-grossing table arcade cabinet for six months through September, October, November and December 1986, up until February 1987. &quot;Arkanoid&quot; was Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing table arcade game during the second half of 1986, and the overall sixth highest-grossing table arcade game of 1986. It later went on to be the country&#x27;s overall highest-grossing table arcade game of 1987.

In the United States, it was the highest-grossing arcade conversion kit of 1987. In the United Kingdom, it was the fourth highest-grossing arcade game of 1986 on London&#x27;s Electrocoin charts. &quot;Euromax&quot; listed it as being the third most popular arcade game in Europe during 1987.

===Critical===
The arcade game was reviewed in &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; by Clare Edgeley in November 1986, where she compared it to &quot;Pong&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in its simplicity and addictiveness. She described &quot;Arkanoid&quot; as &quot;a lovely game&quot; that is &quot;fast, colourful, simple and addictive&quot;.

The home versions were also well received. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated in 1988 that &quot;Arkanoid&quot; on the Amiga was &quot;a perfect version of the arcade game ... &quot;incredible&quot;!&quot; It named the NES version the Best Arcade Translation for the console that year, praising the graphics and play mechanics. The game was reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #144 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. &quot;Compute!&quot; named the game to its list of &quot;nine great games for 1989&quot;, describing it as &quot;hypnotic, addictive, and fascinating&quot;. Along with &quot;Breakout&quot;, the magazine noted &quot;Arkanoid&quot; also has elements of &quot;Pong&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot; as well as &quot;Pac-Man&quot; in its use of power-ups.

===Accolades===
&quot;Arkanoid&quot; and its home releases received several awards, including the &quot;Silver Award&quot; from the &quot;Gamest&quot; Awards, &quot;Games of the Year&quot; from &quot;Compute!&quot; magazine, &quot;Best Arcade Game&quot; from the Entertainment Software Trade Awards, &quot;Best Arcade Translation&quot; from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, and &quot;Best Video/Computer Arcade Translation&quot; (for the NES version) from &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot;. &quot;Arkanoid&quot; was the first game to enter the &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot; Hall of Fame, in 1987.

In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors ranked the NES version the 41st best console video game of all time, describing it as &quot;the type of game that you&#x27;d pick up because you need a quick video game fix but would end up playing for hours&quot;. They particularly noted that despite the ability to shoot lasers, the game demanded a great deal of skill from the player.

==Legacy==
&quot;Arkanoid&quot; was followed by a number of direct and indirect sequels. &quot;Tournament Arkanoid&quot; was released in 1987 exclusively in the United States by Romstar. Developed by Taito America rather than Taito Japan, it has the same gameplay as &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, but adds new levels. &quot;&quot;, a true sequel with new gameplay mechanics, was released in arcades in 1987. &quot;&quot; and &quot;Arkanoid Returns&quot; were published in 1997, followed by &quot;Arkanoid DS&quot; in 2007.

&quot;Arkanoid Live!&quot; was published as on May 6, 2009, for Xbox Live Arcade. The WiiWare game &quot;Arkanoid Plus!&quot; was released in the same year in Japan on May 26, PAL regions on August 21, and in North America on September 28. A version of &quot;Arkanoid&quot; for iOS was released in 2009.

The mashup &quot;Arkanoid vs. Space Invaders&quot; was released in 2017 for iOS and Android.

&quot;Arkanoid&quot; appears in &quot;Life Is Strange: True Colors&quot;.

A modernized version of the game, titled &quot;Arkanoid: Eternal Battle&quot;, was developed by Pastagames and published by Microids. It was released in October 2022 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. The original 1986 arcade version is included in this game.

<doc id="176997" wikidata="Q751507" url="?curid=176997" title="Blindsight">
<text>Blindsight is the ability of people who are cortically blind to respond to visual stimuli that they do not consciously see due to lesions in the primary visual cortex, also known as the striate cortex or Brodmann Area 17. The term was coined by Lawrence Weiskrantz and his colleagues in a paper published in a 1974 issue of &quot;Brain&quot;. A previous paper studying the discriminatory capacity of a cortically blind patient was published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1973. The assumed existence of blindsight is controversial, with some arguing that it is merely degraded conscious vision.

== Type classification ==
The majority of studies on blindsight are conducted on patients who are hemianopic, i.e. blind in one-half of their visual field. Following the destruction of the left or right striate cortex, patients are asked to detect, localize, and discriminate amongst visual stimuli that are presented to their blind side, often in a forced-response or guessing situation, even though they may not consciously recognize the visual stimulus. Research shows that such blind patients may achieve a higher accuracy than would be expected from chance alone.

&quot;Type 1 blindsight&quot; is the term given to this ability to guess—at levels significantly above chance—aspects of a visual stimulus (such as location or type of movement) without any conscious awareness of any stimuli. &quot;Type 2 blindsight&quot; occurs when patients claim to have a feeling that there has been a change within their blind area—e.g. movement—but that it was not a visual percept. The re-classification of blindsight into Type 1 and Type 2 was made after it was shown that the most celebrated blindsight patient, &quot;GY&quot;, was usually conscious of stimuli presented to his blind field if the stimuli had certain specific characteristics, namely being of high contrast and moving fast (at speeds in excess of 20 degrees per second). 

In the aftermath of the First World War, a neurologist, George Riddoch, had described patients who had been blinded by gunshot wounds to V1, who could not see stationary objects but who were, as he reported, &quot;conscious&quot; of seeing moving objects in their blind field. It is for this reason that the phenomenon has more recently also been called the &quot;Riddoch syndrome&quot;.

Since then it has become apparent that such subjects can also become aware of visual stimuli belonging to other visual domains, such as color and luminance, when presented to their blind fields. The ability of such hemianopic subjects to become consciously aware of stimuli presented to their blind field is also commonly referred to as &quot;residual&quot; or &quot;degraded&quot; vision.

As originally defined, &quot;blindsight&quot; challenged the common belief that perceptions must enter consciousness to affect our behavior, by showing that our behavior can be guided by sensory information of which we have no conscious awareness. Since the demonstration that blind patients can experience some visual stimuli consciously, and the consequent redefinition of blindsight into Type 1 and Type 2, a more nuanced view of the phenomenon has developed. Blindsight may be thought of as a converse of the form of anosognosia known as Anton syndrome, in which there is full cortical blindness along with the confabulation of visual experience.

== History ==
Much of our current understanding of blindsight can be attributed to early experiments on monkeys. One monkey, named Helen, could be considered the &quot;star monkey in visual research&quot; because she was the original blindsight subject. Helen was a macaque monkey that had been decorticated; specifically, her primary visual cortex (V1) was completely removed, blinding her. Nevertheless, under certain specific situations, Helen exhibited sighted behavior. Her pupils would dilate and she would blink at stimuli that threatened her eyes. Furthermore, under certain experimental conditions, she could detect a variety of visual stimuli, such as the presence and location of objects, as well as shape, pattern, orientation, motion, and color. In many cases, she was able to navigate her environment and interact with objects as if she were sighted.

A similar phenomenon was also discovered in humans. Subjects who had suffered damage to their visual cortices due to accidents or strokes reported partial or total blindness. Despite this, when prompted they could &quot;guess&quot; the presence and details of objects with above-average accuracy and, much like animal subjects, could catch objects tossed at them. The subjects never developed any kind of confidence in their abilities. Even when told of their successes, they would not begin to spontaneously make &quot;guesses&quot; about objects, but instead still required prompting. Furthermore, blindsight subjects rarely express the amazement about their abilities that sighted people would expect them to express.

== Describing blindsight ==
Patients with blindsight have damage to the system that produces visual perception (the visual cortex of the brain and some of the nerve fibers that bring information to it from the eyes) rather than to the underlying brain system controlling eye movements. The phenomenon was originally thought to show how, after the more complex perception system is damaged, people can use the underlying control system to guide hand movements towards an object even though they cannot see what they are reaching for. Hence, visual information can control behavior without producing a conscious sensation. This ability of those with blindsight to act as if able to see objects that they are unconscious of suggested that consciousness is not a general property of all parts of the brain, but is produced by specialized parts of it.

Blindsight patients show awareness of single visual features, such as edges and motion, but cannot gain a holistic visual percept. This suggests that perceptual awareness is modular and that—in sighted individuals—there is a &quot;binding process that unifies all information into a whole percept&quot;, which is interrupted in patients with such conditions as blindsight and visual agnosia. Therefore, object identification and object recognition are thought to be separate processes and occur in different areas of the brain, working independently from one another. The modular theory of object perception and integration would account for the &quot;hidden perception&quot; experienced in blindsight patients. Research has shown that visual stimuli with the single visual features of sharp borders, sharp onset/offset times, motion and low spatial frequency contribute to, but are not strictly necessary for, an object&#x27;s salience in blindsight.

== Cause ==
There are three theories for the explanation of blindsight. The first states that after damage to area V1, other branches of the optic nerve deliver visual information to the superior colliculus, pulvinar and several other areas, including parts of the cerebral cortex. In turn, these areas might then control the blindsight responses.

Another explanation for the phenomenon of blindsight is that even though the majority of a person&#x27;s visual cortex may be damaged, tiny islands of functioning tissue remain. These islands are not large enough to provide conscious perception, but nevertheless enough for some unconscious visual perception.

A third theory is that the information required to determine the distance to and velocity of an object in object space is determined by the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) before the information is projected to the visual cortex. In a normal subject, these signals are used to merge the information from the eyes into a three-dimensional representation (which includes the position and velocity of individual objects relative to the organism), extract a vergence signal to benefit the precision (previously auxiliary) optical system, and extract a focus control signal for the lenses of the eyes. The stereoscopic information is attached to the object information passed to the visual cortex.

More recently, with the demonstration of a direct input from the LGN to area V5 (MT), which delivers signals from fast moving stimuli at latencies of about 30 ms, another explanation has emerged. This one proposes that the delivery of these signals is sufficient to arouse a conscious experience of fast visual motion, without implying that it is V5 alone that is responsible, since once signals reach V5, they may be propagated to other areas of the brain. The latter account would seem to exclude the possibility that signals are &quot;pre-processed&quot; by V1 or &quot;post-processed&quot; by it (through return connections from V5 back to V1), as has been suggested. The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus also sends direct, V1 by-passing, signals to V5 but their precise role in generating a conscious visual experience of motion has not yet been determined.

Evidence of blindsight can be indirectly observed in children as young as two months, although there is difficulty in determining the type in a patient who is not old enough to answer questions.

== Evidence in animals ==
In a 1995 experiment, researchers attempted to show that monkeys with lesions in or even wholly removed striate cortexes also experienced blindsight. To study this, they had the monkeys complete tasks similar to those commonly used for human subjects. The monkeys were placed in front of a monitor and taught to indicate whether a stationary object or nothing was present in their visual field when a tone was played. Then the monkeys performed the same task except the stationary objects were presented outside of their visual field. The monkeys performed very similar to human participants and were unable to perceive the presence of stationary objects outside of their visual field.

Another 1995 study by the same group sought to prove that monkeys could also be conscious of movement in their deficit visual field despite not being consciously aware of the presence of an object there. To do this, researchers used another standard test for humans which was similar to the previous study except moving objects were presented in the deficit visual field. Starting from the center of the deficit visual field, the object would either move up, down, or to the right. The monkeys performed identically to humans on the test, getting them right almost every time. This showed that the monkey&#x27;s ability to detect movement is separate from their ability to consciously detect an object in their deficit visual field, and gave further evidence for the claim that damage to the striate cortex plays a large role in causing the disorder.

Several years later, another study compared and contrasted the data collected from monkeys and that of a specific human patient with blindsight, GY. GY&#x27;s striate cortical region was damaged through trauma at the age of eight, though for the most part he retained full functionality, GY was not consciously aware of anything in his right visual field. In the monkeys, the striate cortex of the left hemisphere was surgically removed. By comparing the test results of both GY and the monkeys, the researchers concluded that similar patterns of responses to stimuli in the &quot;blind&quot; visual field can be found in both species.

== Research ==
Lawrence Weiskrantz and colleagues showed in the early 1970s that if forced to guess about whether a stimulus is present in their blind field, some observers do better than chance. This ability to detect stimuli that the observer is not conscious of can extend to discrimination of the type of stimulus (for example, whether an &#x27;X&#x27; or &#x27;O&#x27; has been presented in the blind field).

Electrophysiological evidence from the late 1970s has shown that there is no direct retinal input from S-cones to the superior colliculus, implying that the perception of color information should be impaired. However, more recent evidence point to a pathway from S-cones to the superior colliculus, opposing previous research and supporting the idea that some chromatic processing mechanisms are intact in blindsight.

Patients shown images on their blind side of people expressing emotions correctly guessed the emotion most of the time. The movement of facial muscles used in smiling and frowning were measured and reacted in ways that matched the kind of emotion in the unseen image. Therefore, the emotions were recognized without involving conscious sight.

A 2011 study found that a young woman with a unilateral lesion of area V1 could scale her grasping movement as she reached out to pick up objects of different sizes placed in her blind field, even though she could not report the sizes of the objects. Similarly, another patient with unilateral lesion of area V1 could avoid obstacles placed in his blind field when he reached toward a target that was visible in his intact visual field. Even though he avoided the obstacles, he never reported seeing them.

A study reported in 2008 asked patient GY to &quot;mis&quot;state where in his visual field a distinctive stimulus was presented. If the stimulus was in the upper part of his visual field, he was to say it was in the lower part, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. He was able to misstate, as requested, in his left visual field (with normal conscious vision); but he tended to fail in the task—to state the location correctly—when the stimulus was in his blindsight (right) visual field. This failure rate worsened when the stimulus was clearer, indicating that failure was not simply due to unreliability of blindsight.

===Case studies===
==== &quot;DB&quot; ====
Researchers applied the same type of tests that were used to study blindsight in animals to a patient referred to as &quot;DB&quot;. The normal techniques used to assess visual acuity in humans involved asking them to verbally describe some visually recognizable aspect of an object or objects. DB was given forced-choice tasks to complete instead. The results of DB&#x27;s guesses showed that DB was able to determine shape and detect movement at some unconscious level, despite not being visually aware of this. DB himself chalked up the accuracy of his guesses to be merely coincidental.

The discovery of the condition known as blindsight raised questions about how different types of visual information, even unconscious information, may be affected and sometimes even unaffected by damage to different areas of the visual cortex. Previous studies had already demonstrated that even without conscious awareness of visual stimuli, humans could still determine certain visual features such as presence in the visual field, shape, orientation and movement. But, in a newer study evidence showed that if damage to the visual cortex occurs in areas above the primary visual cortex, the conscious awareness of visual stimuli itself is not damaged. Blindsight shows that even when the primary visual cortex is damaged or removed a person can still perform actions guided by unconscious visual information. Despite damage occurring in the area necessary for conscious awareness of visual information, other functions of the processing of these visual percepts are still available to the individual. The same also goes for damage to other areas of the visual cortex. If an area of the cortex that is responsible for a certain function is damaged, it will only result in the loss of that particular function or aspect, functions that other parts of the visual cortex are responsible for remain intact.

==== Alexander and Cowey ====
Alexander and Cowey investigated how contrasting stimuli brightness affects blindsight patients&#x27; ability to discern movement. Prior studies have already shown that blindsight patients are able to detect motion even though they claim they do not see any visual percepts in their blind fields. The study subjects were two patients who suffered from hemianopsia—blindness in more than half of their visual field. Both subjects had displayed the ability to accurately determine the presence of visual stimuli in their blind hemifields without acknowledging an actual visual percept previously.

To test the effect of brightness on the subject&#x27;s ability to determine motion they used a white background with a series of colored dots. The contrast of the brightness of the dots compared to the white background was altered in each trial to determine if the participants performed better or worse when there was a larger discrepancy in brightness or not. The subjects focused on the display for two equal length time intervals and were asked whether they thought the dots were moving during the first or the second time interval.

When the contrast in brightness between the background and the dots was higher, both of the subjects could discern motion more accurately than they would have statistically through guesswork. However, one subject was not able to accurately determine whether or not blue dots were moving regardless of the brightness contrast, but he/she was able to do so with every other color dot. When the contrast was highest, subjects were able to tell whether or not the dots were moving with very high rates of accuracy. Even when the dots were white, but still of a different brightness from the background, subjects could still determine whether they were moving. But, regardless of the dots&#x27; color, subjects could not tell when they were in motion when the white background and the dots were of similar brightness.

==== Kentridge, Heywood, and Weiskrantz ====
Kentridge, Heywood, and Weiskrantz used the phenomenon of blindsight to investigate the connection between visual attention and visual awareness. They wanted to see if their subject—who exhibited blindsight in other studies—could react more quickly when their attention was cued without the ability to be visually aware of it. The researchers aimed to show that being conscious of a stimulus and paying attention to it was not the same thing.

To test the relationship between attention and awareness, they had the participant try to determine where a target was and whether it was oriented horizontally or vertically on a computer screen. The target line would appear at one of two different locations and would be oriented in one of two directions. Before the target would appear an arrow would become visible on the screen, sometimes pointing to the correct position of the target line and less frequently not. This arrow was the cue for the subject. The participant would press a key to indicate whether the line was horizontal or vertical, and could then also indicate to an observer whether or not he/she actually had a feeling that any object was there or not—even if they couldn&#x27;t see anything. The participant was able to accurately determine the orientation of the line when the target was cued by an arrow before the appearance of the target, even though these visual stimuli did not equal awareness in the subject who had no vision in that area of his/her visual field. The study showed that even without the ability to be visually aware of a stimulus the participant could still focus his/her attention on this object.

==== &quot;TN&quot; ====
In 2003, a patient known as &quot;TN&quot; lost use of his primary visual cortex, area V1. He had two successive strokes, which knocked out the region in both his left and right hemispheres. After his strokes, ordinary tests of TN&#x27;s sight turned up nothing. He could not even detect large objects moving right in front of his eyes. Researchers eventually began to notice that TN exhibited signs of blindsight and in 2008 decided to test their theory. They took TN into a hallway and asked him to walk through it without using the cane he always carried after having the strokes. TN was not aware at the time, but the researchers had placed various obstacles in the hallway to test if he could avoid them without conscious use of his sight. To the researchers&#x27; delight, he moved around every obstacle with ease, at one point even pressing himself up against the wall to squeeze past a trashcan placed in his way. After navigating through the hallway, TN reported that he was just walking the way he wanted to, not because he knew anything was there.

==== &quot;Mr. J&quot; ====
In another case study, a girl brought her grandfather in to see a neuropsychologist. The girl&#x27;s grandfather, Mr. J., had suffered a stroke that had left him completely blind apart from a tiny spot in the middle of his visual field. The neuropsychologist, Dr. M., performed an exercise with him. The doctor helped Mr. J. to a chair, had him sit down, and then asked to borrow his cane. The doctor then asked, &quot;Mr. J., please look straight ahead. Keep looking that way, and don&#x27;t move your eyes or turn your head. I know that you can see a little bit straight ahead of you, and I don&#x27;t want you to use that piece of vision for what I&#x27;m going to ask you to do. Fine. Now, I&#x27;d like you to reach out with your right hand [and] point to what I&#x27;m holding.&quot; Mr. J. then replied, &quot;But I don&#x27;t see anything—I&#x27;m blind!&quot; The doctor then said, &quot;I know, but please try, anyway.&quot; Mr. J then shrugged and pointed, and was surprised when his finger encountered the end of the cane which the doctor was pointing toward him. After this, Mr. J. said that &quot;it was just luck&quot;. The doctor then turned the cane around so that the handle side was pointing towards Mr. J. He then asked for Mr. J. to grab hold of the cane. Mr. J. reached out with an open hand and grabbed hold of the cane. After this, the doctor said, &quot;Good. Now put your hand down, please.&quot; The doctor then rotated the cane 90 degrees, so that the handle was oriented vertically. The doctor then asked Mr. J. to reach for the cane again. Mr. J. did this, turning his wrist so that his hand matched the orientation of the handle. This case study shows that, although (on a conscious level) Mr. J. was completely unaware of any visual abilities that he may have had, he was able to orient his grabbing motions as if he had no visual impairments.

== Brain regions involved ==
Visual processing in the brain goes through a series of stages. Destruction of the primary visual cortex leads to blindness in the part of the visual field that corresponds to the damaged cortical representation. The area of blindness – known as a scotoma – is in the visual field opposite the damaged hemisphere and can vary from a small area up to the entire hemifield. Visual processing occurs in the brain in a hierarchical series of stages (with much crosstalk and feedback between areas). The route from the retina through V1 is not the only visual pathway into the cortex, though it is by far the largest; it is commonly thought that the residual performance of people exhibiting blindsight is due to preserved pathways into the extrastriate cortex that bypass V1. However both physiological evidence in monkeys and behavioral and imaging evidence in humans shows that activity in these extrastriate areas, and especially in V5, is apparently sufficient to support visual awareness in the absence of V1.

To put it in a more complex way, recent physiological findings suggest that visual processing takes place along several independent, parallel pathways. One system processes information about shape, one about color, and one about movement, location and spatial organization. This information moves through an area of the brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus, located in the thalamus, and on to be processed in the primary visual cortex, area V1 (also known as the striate cortex because of its striped appearance). People with damage to V1 report no conscious vision, no visual imagery, and no visual images in their dreams. However, some of these people still experience the blindsight phenomenon, though this too is controversial, with some studies showing a limited amount of consciousness without V1 or projections relating to it.

The superior colliculus and prefrontal cortex also have a major role in awareness of a visual stimulus.

=== Lateral geniculate nucleus ===
Mosby&#x27;s Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing &amp; Health Professions defines the LGN as &quot;one of two elevations of the lateral posterior thalamus receiving visual impulses from the retina via the optic nerves and tracts and relaying the impulses to the calcarine (visual) cortex&quot;.

What is seen in the left and right visual field is taken in by each eye and brought back to the optic disc via the nerve fibres of the retina. From the optic disc, visual information travels through the optic nerve and into the optic chiasm. Visual information then enters the optic tract and travels to four different areas of the brain including the superior colliculus, pretectum of the mid brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Most axons from the LGN will then travel to the primary visual cortex.

Injury to the primary visual cortex, including lesions and other trauma, leads to the loss of visual experience. However, the residual vision that is left cannot be attributed to V1. According to Schmid et al., &quot;thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information&quot;. This information was found through experiments using fMRI during activation and inactivation of the LGN and the contribution the LGN has on visual experience in monkeys with a V1 lesion. These researchers concluded that the magnocellular system of the LGN is less affected by the removal of V1, which suggests that it is because of this system in the LGN that blindsight occurs. Furthermore, once the LGN was inactivated, virtually all of the extrastriate areas of the brain no longer showed a response on the fMRI. The information leads to a qualitative assessment that included &quot;scotoma stimulation, with the LGN intact had fMRI activation of ~20% of that under normal conditions&quot;. This finding agrees with the information obtained from, and fMRI images of, patients with blindsight. The same study also supported the conclusion that the LGN plays a substantial role in blindsight. Specifically, while injury to V1 does create a loss of vision, the LGN is less affected and may result in the residual vision that remains, causing the &quot;sight&quot; in blindsight.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging has launched has also been employed to conduct brain scans in normal, healthy human volunteers to attempt to demonstrate that visual motion can bypass V1, through a connection from the LGN to the human middle temporal complex. Their findings concluded that there was an indeed a connection of visual motion information that went directly from the LGN to the V5/hMT+ bypassing V1 completely. Evidence also suggests that, following a traumatic injury to V1, there is still a direct pathway from the retina through the LGN to the extrastriate visual areas. The extrastriate visual areas include parts of the occipital lobe that surround V1. In non-human primates, these often include V2, V3, and V4.

In a study conducted in primates, after partial ablation of area V1, areas V2 and V3 were still excited by visual stimulus. Other evidence suggests that &quot;the LGN projections that survive V1 removal are relatively sparse in density, but are nevertheless widespread and probably encompass all extrastriate visual areas,&quot; including V2, V4, V5 and the inferotemporal cortex region.

== Controversy ==
The results of some experiments suggest that blindsighted people may be preserving some kind of conscious experience and thus they are not fully blind. The criteria for blindsight has repeatedly changed based on findings that challenge the original definition, which has led some scientists to cast doubt on the existence of blindsight.

<text>Julie Newmar (born Julia Chalene Newmeyer; August 16, 1933) is an American actress, dancer, and singer known for a variety of stage, screen, and television roles. She is also a writer, lingerie designer, and real estate mogul. She won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her role as Katrin Sveg in the 1958 Broadway production of &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot;, and reprised the role in the 1961 film version. In the 1960s she starred for two seasons as Catwoman in the television series &quot;Batman&quot; (1966–1967). Her other stage credits include &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; in 1956, Lola in &quot;Damn Yankees!&quot; in 1961 and, in 1965, as Irma in regional productions of &quot;Irma la Douce&quot;.

Newmar appeared in the music video for George Michael&#x27;s 1992 single &quot;Too Funky&quot; and had a cameo as herself in the 1995 film &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot;. Her voice work includes the animated feature films &quot;&quot; (2016) and &quot;Batman vs. Two-Face&quot; (2017), for which she reprised her role as Catwoman, fifty years after the original television series.

==Early life==
Newmar was born in Los Angeles, California, on August 16, 1933, as the eldest of three children born to Don and Helene (née Jesmer) Newmeyer. Her father was head of the physical education department at Los Angeles City College, and had played American football professionally in the 1920s with the 1926 Los Angeles Buccaneers of the National Football League. Her Swedish-French mother was a fashion designer – who used &quot;Chalene&quot; as her professional name – and later became a real-estate investor.

Newmar has two younger brothers: Peter Bruce Newmeyer, who was killed in a skiing accident, and John A. Newmeyer, who became a writer, epidemiologist and winemaker. She began dancing at an early age, and performed as a prima ballerina with the Los Angeles Opera when she was 15.

==Career==

===Early work and stage career===

Newmar appeared in bit parts and uncredited roles in films as a dancer, including a part as the &quot;dancer-assassin&quot; in &quot;Slaves of Babylon&quot; (1953) and the &quot;gilded girl&quot; in &quot;Serpent of the Nile&quot; (1953), in which she was clad in gold paint. She danced in several other films, including &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (also 1953) and &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot; (1954). She also worked as a choreographer and dancer for Universal Studios beginning at the age of 19. Her first major role, billed as Julie Newmeyer, was as Dorcas, one of the brides in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954). She was also the female lead in a low-budget comedy, &quot;The Rookie&quot; (1959).

Newmar made her Broadway debut in 1955 as Vera in &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;, starring Hildegarde Neff and Don Ameche. In the following year she created the role of Stupefyin&#x27; Jones (a three-minute cameo) in the Broadway production of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. She stayed with the production for its entire run from November 1956 through July 1958, and also appeared in the film version, released in 1959. A few months later, &quot;The Marriage-Go-Round&quot; opened on Broadway, with Newmar in the role of Swedish vixen Katrin Sveg, for which Newmar won the 1959 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. She later re-created this role for the 1961 film adaptation, starring James Mason and Susan Hayward. In 1961, she appeared in the Sam Spewack play &quot;Once There Was a Russian&quot;, which lasted only one performance. She later starred opposite Joel Grey in the national tour of &quot;Stop the World – I Want to Get Off&quot;, staying with the tour from March to October 1963. In 1973, Newmar was slated to return to Broadway in the David Rabe play &quot;Boom Boom Room&quot;, opening on November 8, 1973, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. Director Julie Bovasso fired Newmar during rehearsals, and she was replaced by her understudy, Mary Woronov. Bovasso was then replaced as director during previews.

===Television work===

Newmar&#x27;s fame stems mainly from her television appearances. Her statuesque form and height made her a larger-than-life sex symbol, most often cast as a temptress or Amazonian beauty, including an early appearance in a sexy maid costume in &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;. She starred as Rhoda the Robot in the television series &quot;My Living Doll&quot; (1964–1965), and is known for her recurring role in the 1960s television series &quot;Batman&quot; as the villainess Catwoman. (Lee Meriwether played Catwoman in the 1966 feature film, and Eartha Kitt portrayed Catwoman in the series&#x27; final season.) Newmar modified her Catwoman costume—now in the Smithsonian Institution—and placed the belt at the hips instead of the waist to emphasize her hourglass figure.

In 1962, Newmar appeared twice as the motorcycle-riding, free-spirited heiress Vicki Russell in &quot;Route 66&quot;, filmed in Tucson (&quot;How Much a Pound Is Albatross&quot;) and in Tennessee (&quot;Give the Old Cat a Tender Mouse&quot;). She guest-starred in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; as the devil in &quot;Of Late I Think of Cliffordville&quot;, &quot;F Troop&quot; (&quot;Yellow Bird&quot; in 1966) as a girl kidnapped as a child and raised by Native Americans, &quot;Bewitched&quot; (&quot;The Eight-Year Itch Witch&quot; in 1971) as a cat named Ophelia given human form, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; as a Swedish actress who stays with the Clampetts to learn their accents and mannerisms for a role, and &quot;Get Smart&quot; as a double agent, posing as a maid, assigned to Maxwell Smart&#x27;s apartment. In 1967, she guest-starred as April Conquest in an episode of &quot;The Monkees&quot; (&quot;Monkees Get Out More Dirt&quot;, season 1, episode 29), in which the main characters all fall in love with her, and played the pregnant Capellan princess, Eleen, in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot;. In 1969, she played a hit woman in the &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; episode &quot;The Funeral is on Mundy&quot; with Robert Wagner. In 1983, she reprised the hit-woman role in &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, Wagner&#x27;s later television series, in the episode &quot;A Change of Hart&quot;. In the 1970s she had guest roles in &quot;Columbo&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;.

===Later roles===

Newmar appeared in several low-budget films during the next two decades. She guest-starred on TV, appearing in &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, &quot;CHiPs&quot;, and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. She was seen in the music video for George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Too Funky&quot; in 1992, and appeared as herself in a 1996 episode of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;.

In 2003, Newmar appeared as herself in the television movie &quot;Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt&quot; alongside former &quot;Batman&quot; co-stars Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin, and Lee Meriwether. Julia Rose played Newmar in flashbacks to the production of the television series. However, due to longstanding rights issues over footage from the &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, only footage of Meriwether taken from the feature film was allowed to be used in the television movie. In 2016, she provided the voice of Catwoman in the animated film &quot;&quot;. In 2017, she reprised her role in the animated sequel &quot;Batman vs. Two-Face&quot;. Newmar also appeared on &quot;The Home and Family Show&quot; in May 2016, where she met &quot;Gotham&quot; actress Camren Bicondova who portrays a younger Selina Kyle.

In 2019, Newmar played the role of Dr. Julia Hoffman (replacing the late Grayson Hall) in the audio drama miniseries &quot;Dark Shadows: Bloodline&quot;.

==Inventor and entrepreneur==
In the 1970s, Newmar received two U.S. patents for pantyhose and one for a brassiere. The pantyhose were described as having &quot;cheeky derriere relief&quot; and promoted under the name &quot;Nudemar&quot;. The brassiere was described as &quot;nearly invisible&quot; and in the style of Marilyn Monroe.

Newmar began investing in Los Angeles real estate in the 1980s. A women&#x27;s magazine stated, &quot;Newmar is partly responsible for improving the Los Angeles neighborhoods on La Brea Avenue and Fairfax Avenue near the Grove.&quot;

==Personal life==
After a broken engagement to novelist Louis L&#x27;Amour and romances with comedian Mort Sahl and actor Ken Scott, Newmar married J. Holt Smith, a lawyer, on August 5, 1977, and moved with him to Fort Worth, Texas, where she lived until their divorce in 1984. She has one child.

Newmar has Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, an inherited neurological condition that affects one in 2,500 Americans.

A legal battle with her neighbor, actor Jim Belushi, ended amicably with an invitation to guest-star in his sitcom &quot;According to Jim&quot; in an episode (&quot;The Grumpy Guy&quot;) that poked fun at the feud.

An avid gardener, Newmar initiated at least a temporary ban on leaf blowers with the Los Angeles City Council.

Newmar has been a vocal supporter of LGBT rights; her brother, John Newmeyer, is gay. In 2013, she was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Gay and Lesbian Elder Housing organization in Los Angeles.

Newmar is a classically trained pianist.

==In popular culture==
In 2012, Bluewater Comics released a four-issue comic miniseries titled &quot;The Secret Lives of Julie Newmar&quot;.

<text>Barenaked Ladies (more commonly known as &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot;), is the Barenaked Ladies&#x27; third indie tape release, after &quot;Buck Naked&quot; in 1989 with just Ed Robertson and Steven Page, then &quot;Barenaked Lunch&quot; (also known as the &quot;Pink Tape&quot;) in 1990, with bassist Jim Creeggan and percussionist Andy Creeggan. It was recorded in 1991 at Wellesley Sound by Walter Sobczak in Toronto (except for &quot;Be My Yoko Ono,&quot; which had been recorded earlier at Number 9 Audio Group).

It was originally recorded as a demo for the band&#x27;s performance at South by Southwest. &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot; did very well, becoming the first indie tape to achieve platinum status in Canada. Although officially self-titled, it is commonly referred to as &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot; due to its yellow cover.

It was re-released by Cheree Records in CD and vinyl record formats as &quot;Barenaked Ladies&quot; in the United Kingdom. The UK release dropped the track &quot;Fight the Power.&quot;

Early copies of the tape include an error in the J-card notes: drummer Tyler Stewart&#x27;s name is misspelled as &quot;Steward.&quot; It also includes a different address for the band&#x27;s management.

In 1995, the band&#x27;s &quot;Shoe Box&quot; E.P. single featured this recording of &quot;If I Had $1000000,&quot; listed officially as &quot;Yellow Tape Version,&quot; indicating the band themselves refer to this release by its common name.

<text>Vancouver International Airport is an international airport located on Sea Island in Richmond, British Columbia, serving the city of Vancouver and the Lower Mainland region. It is located from Downtown Vancouver. YVR is the second busiest airport in Canada by passenger traffic (24.9 million), behind Toronto Pearson International Airport in Ontario. As a trans-Pacific hub, the airport has more direct flights to China than any other airport in North America or Europe. It is a hub for Air Canada and WestJet. Vancouver International Airport is one of eight Canadian airports that have US Border Pre-clearance facilities. It is also one of the few major international airports to have a terminal for scheduled float planes.

The airport has won several notable international best airport awards. It won the SkyTrax Best North American Airport award in 2007 and 2010 through 2022, for a record of 12 consecutive years. The airport also made the top 10 list of airports in the world for the first time in 2012, rated at 9th (2012), 8th (2013), and 9th (2014) overall. It is the only North American airport included in the top 10 for 2013 and 2014. YVR also retains the distinction of Best Canadian Airport in the regional results.

Vancouver International airport is managed by Vancouver Airport Authority, a non-profit organization.

YVR covers a total expanse of about 1,340 hectares (3,311 acres) of airport property.

==History==
In 1929, the City of Vancouver purchased land located on Sea Island to be used for aviation purposes, replacing the original grass airstrip at Minoru Park on Lulu Island. During World War II, the airport and its original terminal, now the South Terminal, were leased to the federal government and operated by the Department of National Defence and the Department of Transport as RCAF Station Sea Island. The airport was used for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. The crews and their families were housed in a new town-site on the island, named Burkeville, after Boeing president Stanley Burke. Funds from the lease were used to purchase additional land for new hangars and a production plant for Boeing Aircraft of Canada (now Boeing Canada).

The present main terminal was completed in 1968 and has since been expanded to include separate domestic and international terminals. A north runway was completed in 1996.

A United States border pre-clearance facility was created in the 1970s, and as of 2024 has the largest operating hours of any US pre-clearance facility, operating from 4:30 AM to midnight the next day.

In 2011, the airport announced that it would enact a program aiming to encourage airlines to start more flights between Vancouver and Asia. As of 2022, the program has succeeded in many of its goals.

The airport has often been described as a major trans-Pacific hub due to its location in the Pacific Northwest and destinations in the Americas, Asia, and Australia, which help facilitate connecting flights. In 2019, Craig Richmond, then President and CEO of the Vancouver Airport Authority, said that the recent growth of Seattle–Tacoma International Airport in the United States could challenge Vancouver&#x27;s status as a trans-Pacific hub, although Seattle/Tacoma is already the larger airport.

==Terminals==
Vancouver International Airport has two terminals: the Main Terminal and the South Terminal. The main terminal contains domestic and international concourses. Free internet access is available in all sections of the airport. Throughout the airport, there is trilingual English, French, and Chinese signage. The South Terminal, along with the adjacent floatplane docks, is referred to by airport management as &quot;Airport South.&quot;.

=== Domestic Concourse ===

The Domestic section of the terminal was constructed in 1968 by the Vancouver-based firm Thompson, Berwick and Pratt and was given a top-to-bottom renovation in 2005 by Vancouver architect Kasian Kennedy. The Domestic area consists of three piers (A-C).

==== Pier A ====
Pier A consists of six gates: A6 through A10 and A12. These gates are ground loading ramps used by WestJet Encore.

==== Pier B ====
Pier B consists of 15 gates: gates B13 through B27. Gates B14 to B17 can receive international and US arrivals. Gate B23 to B25 are ground loading ramps. Pier B is the hub for domestic flights for WestJet, and additionally serves domestic flights by Air North, Air Transat, Flair Airlines and Porter Airlines.

==== Pier C ====
Pier C consists of 24 gates: C29 through C52. This is the hub for Air Canada and Air Canada Express domestic flights. Gates C48 to C52 are swing gates, which can be used for international departures (designated as D48 to D52) as well as international and US arrivals.

=== International &amp; U.S. Concourse ===

The International concourse was designed by Vancouver-based &quot;Architectura&quot;, now Stantec, with Kansas City–based HNTB Corporation (1994–1996). It was expanded to the west between 2017 and 2021 to allow for more gates and more remote stand operations. YVR is one of eight Canadian airports with United States border preclearance facilities, which are situated in this section of the terminal. All international concourse gates can accept flights arriving from international and U.S. origins; passengers are directed onto overhead walkways which lead to the Canada Border Services Agency screening area.

==== Pier D (International Pier)====

Pier D consists of 31 gates: D48 to D78, of which 7 (D56, D57, D59, D60, D61, D63, and D65) are bus gates for remote stands. All international-bound flights, excluding those to the United States, depart from D gates. All gates can handle wide-body aircraft; 11 gates are fitted with 2 jet bridges, and four of these gates can handle the Airbus A380, a service of which was seasonally operated to Vancouver by British Airways until September 26, 2022. Gates D48 to D52 are swing gates which can be used for domestic departures (designated C48 to C52), and gates D71 through D78 are swing gates which can be used for United States border preclearance flights (designated E71 through E78).

A SkyTeam airport lounge operated by Global Lounge Network is located near gate D53 and the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge is at Gate D52.

==== Pier E (U.S. Pier)====
Preclearance was added to the airport in the 1970s.

Pier E is the US border preclearance area and consists of 25 gates: E71 to E88 and E90 to E96. Gates E71 to E78 are swing gates which can be used switched to international departures (as gates D71 to D78) as needed. Gate E84 is a bus gate for remote stands. Gates E90-E96 are located in a smaller satellite building connected via a ground-level walkway. Gate E95 accesses ground-loading stands 95A and 95B.

Flights from an international origin continuing on to the US after a stopover in Vancouver (none of which currently operate) do not use the preclearance facility and must use D gates.

===Airport South===

The Airport South complex includes the South Terminal, the Floatplane Facility, and other adjacent operations.

====South Terminal====
The South Terminal, a portion of the original pre-1968 terminal which is still in use, also houses the corporate headquarters and main base of Pacific Coastal Airlines and Harbour Air.

The South Terminal serves regional airlines which fly mostly within British Columbia, such as Pacific Coastal Airlines and Central Mountain Air, in addition to chartered flights. A nearby building serves as the YVR terminal for Helijet.

====Floatplane facility====
The Vancouver International Water Airport is located on Inglis Drive, a short distance from the South Terminal. This facility allows floatplanes to land and dock on the South Arm of the Fraser River. The facility is served by all floatplane operators other than Harbour Air, which maintains a separate dock and terminal at the Flying Beaver Bar and Grill nearby.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

===Cargo===

==Statistics==
Vancouver International has seen a steady increase in passenger volumes from 2010 to 2019. Between 2020 and 2021, patronage dropped significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport has seen a steady recovery of passengers, however; the patronage in 2022 was about 72% of the patronage in 2019.

===Annual traffic===






==Ground transportation==
===Rapid transit (SkyTrain)===

The airport has a station on the SkyTrain network called YVR–Airport, the terminus of the Sea Island branch of the Canada Line. The airport authority contributed $300 million towards construction as part of the Canada Line&#x27;s funding. A pedestrian footbridge ($117 million, completed in 2007) links the international terminal with the domestic terminal and serves as the arrival and departure area for users of the Canada Line. The Canada Line itself opened in August 2009 as the third line of Vancouver&#x27;s rapid transit network, in advance of the 2010 Winter Olympics which took place the following February. It was the only airport rail link service of any kind in Canada until the opening of Toronto&#x27;s Union Pearson Express in 2015.

===Bus===
When Canada Line service is interrupted, such as overnight or other service disruptions, the N10 night bus operated by Coast Mountain Bus Company (under contract to TransLink) connects the airport&#x27;s international and domestic terminals to Richmond and downtown Vancouver. The airport&#x27;s south terminal is served by the 412 bus, which connects to the Canada Line at Bridgeport Station. Between 2001 and the Canada Line&#x27;s opening in 2009, regular bus service was provided by TransLink route 424.

====Whistler, Squamish, and Victoria ====
YVR Skylynx is an official partner of YVR Vancouver Airport.

YVR Skylynx buses to Whistler run directly from YVR Vancouver Airport and Vancouver City Centre to Squamish, Creekside Village, and Whistler using up to 16 services a day. YVR Skylynx also operates daily services to Victoria from YVR Vancouver Airport via BC Ferries Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay route.

==Expansion==
In preparation for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games, YVR completed a $1.4-billion multi-year capital development plan, which included a four-gate expansion to the International Terminal Wing, completed in June 2007. Two of the four new gates are conventional wide-bodied gates and two can accommodate the Airbus A380. The international terminal addition includes interior design elements intended to represent British Columbia, including a stream in a pathway and fish and jellyfish tanks.

A five-gate expansion was completed in 2009 for Domestic Terminal&#x27;s C-Pier. Food and retail expansions were also completed for the C Pier at this time. The train that links downtown Vancouver, YVR, and central Richmond opened in August 2009.

Vancouver International Airport Authority has developed a 2017–2037 Master Plan, named Flight Plan 2037 which includes 75 projects at a projected cost of $5.6 billion. The plan allows for the airport to serve 35 million passengers by 2037. The plan is calling for the expansion of facilities around the existing large terminal. New piers and gates are to be added, as well as a second parking garage and taxiways. It is also planned to improve vehicle access. Eight gates were added to the international terminal in the first phase which was completed in February 2021. Final approval of the plan by the Ministry of Transport is needed.

==Distinctives==
===Architecture===

YVR&#x27;s interior has a uniquely British Columbian theme, featuring an extensive collection of Pacific Northwest Coast Native art, and blues and greens to reflect the colours of the land, sea, and sky. This theme was designed by Vancouver-based firm &quot;Architectura&quot;. The airport uses a great deal of carpet and vast expanses of glass to let in large amounts of natural light. One of the most noticeable places for an arriving passenger is the international arrivals hall, a large area where customs and immigration procedures are completed. Arriving passengers come down escalators leading to a platform across a large waterfall.

In 2020, the expansion of International Pier D was completed with a glassed-in island forest with access to the outdoors and an immersive digital experience that explores the rugged British Columbia Coast.
=== Art ===
The YVR aboriginal art collection includes wooden sculptures and totem poles. Bill Reid&#x27;s sculpture in bronze, &quot;The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, The Jade Canoe&quot;, is displayed in the international departures area. This is the second of two castings of this sculpture; the first casting, &quot;The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, The Black Canoe&quot;, is now displayed outside the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C. The Pacific Passage area includes artwork by Stan Wamiss and Connie Watts. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at Vancouver International Airport.

===Accessibility===
Since 1992, Vancouver Airport Authority has been working with an independent accessibility consultant to eliminate the physical barriers in the built environment and is &quot;committed to providing fully accessible terminal facilities for people of all backgrounds and capabilities&quot;.

In 2004, the airport received the Rick Hansen Accessibility Award, which recognizes &quot;facilities and communities that improve the quality of life for people with mobility limitations&quot;.

Designated short-term parking spaces and curb-side ramps are available on each level of the terminal building for vehicles displaying a valid SPARC permit. Accessible counters with toe clearance for wheelchair users are also available at the check-in, customer care, and retail area in Vancouver Airport. Bathrooms have also been designed to be wheelchair-accessible with doorless and no-touch entry features, lowered sinks, and hands-free bathroom dispensers. Grab bars and emergency call buttons are also present in all wheelchair-accessible toilet stalls.

Low resistance carpeting and other materials such as laminate flooring have been utilized throughout the airport to make it easier for people using wheelchairs and walkers to move throughout the airport. Elevators are large and allow for easy turning in a wheelchair and special wheelchairs designed to fit down aircraft aisles are utilized to assist with boarding and de-planing. Wheelchair lifts have been installed at aircraft gates.

&quot;Visual pagers&quot; are dedicated video monitors that are located throughout the airport and convey important information to travelers who have hearing impairments.

Various types of flooring are utilized throughout the terminal and function as a textured guide to assist travelers in identifying their location within the airport. In areas with tile, patterns in the tile help to identify exits. Tactile maps are also available at customer service counters throughout the airport, and braille and tactile lettering are used throughout the airport to indicate building features such as washrooms.

===Green Coat Ambassadors===
Vancouver Airport Authority was one of the first airports in North America to institute a volunteer program in 1989. Volunteers in a green vest/jacket are deployed around the airport to provide information, customer service and be the &#x27;eyes and ears&#x27; for the various partners in the airport community between the hours of 6am to 10pm every day. Volunteers are given basic training in airport operations and undertake many of the similar trainings mandated to airport employees. Each volunteer is required to obtain a Transportation Security Clearance and Restricted Area Identification Card to access the restricted and sterile areas of the terminal.

===Sustainability programs===

YVR Sustainability is an operations department at Vancouver International Airport that is concerned with airport green initiatives. It focuses on green initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of the airport&#x27;s operations. YVR&#x27;s sustainability is also known for its green art linked to the environment and community and its indoor nature displays.

YVR&#x27;s Vancouver Airport Services created an energy reduction committee in 1999 to create new energy-reducing initiatives, including improved efficiency of baggage conveyor belts to shut down conveyors when no bags are present; installing carbon dioxide sensors to adjust HVAC systems to the number of people in an area; and regulating electrical power for flight information display monitors when no flights are scheduled. In 2005, the committee installed LED lighting on several taxiways and more efficient, brighter lights on Levels 2 and 3 of the car parking structure, upgrades to the chilled water distribution system, and replacement of all Airport Authority computer equipment with newer, more efficient models.&quot; The building and lighting system are designed to utilize as much daylight as possible so that it is the primary lighting source. The Committee claims to have saved more than 24 gigawatt hours of electricity and $5.5 million since the team&#x27;s creation.

In 2015, the airport set a goal for 50% of the ground support equipment to run on electric power by the year 2020. This goal was achieved early, as by late 2019, 53% of these machines operated on electric power. The airport installed 50 charging stations to support this operation. The airport also has a comprehensive fleet management plan, to ensure that ground support equipment operators maintain and electrify the fleet of the right size. They also have eight battery electric apron buses to support the operation of aircraft on remote stands separate from the terminal building.

The solar-powered hot water systems were installed in the airport&#x27;s Domestic and International terminals in 2003. The 100 solar panels were placed on the roof of the YVR building and will heat more than 800 gallons of water each hour. This has resulted in approximately $110,000 and 8569 gigajoules saved each year. The project was partly funded by BC Hydro working with the Vancouver International Airport Authority to reduce energy consumption and costs at YVR. YVR also uses nightly energy set backs, carbon dioxide sensors, and improved scheduling and system tune-ups since 2001 which has led to a decrease of 25 per cent in natural gas usage.
YVR has 100 hybrid and natural gas-operated taxis hired to pick up and drop off passengers. The Airport Authority created a program in 2004 that gave incentive for alternative fuel taxis and was successful by improving the average fleet fuel economy by 47% by 2009. YVR has 450 recycling containers evenly distributed and located around its terminals, divided for recycling plastic and paper. The containers themselves are made from recycled aluminum, steel and plastic and help recycle over 1,250,000 kg of material each year.

In June 2009, YVR had a green wall installed by the Canada Line YVR–Airport Station and can best be viewed from the International Departures terminal on Level 3 and from the International Arrivals terminal on Level 2. This is the first Canadian airport with a living green wall and the largest in North America. The green wall measures &quot;18-metres high and 12 -metres wide and is home to 28,249 individual plants on 2,173 panels and houses a built-in irrigation and feeding system.&quot; The plants it consists of are &quot;Euonymus japonicus microphyllus, Euonymus japonicus albovariegatus microphyllus, Polypodium glycyrrhiza&quot;, and &quot;Ophiopogon japonicus nanus&quot;. Benefits of a green wall on the building include improving air quality, reducing noise pollution (the green wall is located near the Sky Train), cooling the area down and saving on energy costs, and decreases carbon dioxide emissions in the environment. YVR includes other environmental indoor installations such as its indoor garden, aquarium, and a freshwater creek. The 30,000 gallon salt water aquarium at YVR is home to about 850 samples of British Columbia marine life. There is also a 750 gallon jellyfish tank and a 60-metre long fresh water creek located nearby.

The YVR Fuel project plans to build an underground pipeline and upgrade an airport fuel terminal near the Fraser River. In 2014, the YVR Fuel Project was granted approval with 64 conditions. An information bulletin posted by the Ministry of Environment of British Columbia announced that the project is &quot;not expected to result in any significant adverse effects, based on the mitigation measures and conditions of the Environmental Assessment Certificate.&quot; Nonetheless, the YVR Airport Fuel Facilities will have to carry out the project in accordance to the conditions made by the Environmental Assessment Office. Key conditions deal with spill and fire prevention, preparedness and response, cleaning, inspection, dealing with pollution liabilities, environmental remediation, and compensating for Aboriginal loss under the Fisheries Act.
Marine pilots will have to be specially trained for the river&#x27;s environment, tankers double-hulled, pre-screened and each boat will have to have two tugs. The reason for the YVR fuel upgrade is because the Fuel Facilities Corp. states the current fuel-delivery system is not sustainable and too dependent on an older pipeline coming from Burnaby, British Columbia and shipments from Washington state. With its own fuel, YVR will have more room and independence to welcome new flights and airlines.

The Vancouver International Airport Security submitted a 2009-2013 Noise Management Plan to the Canadian Ministry of Transport in August 2013 which was reviewed and approved. This Management Plan included initiatives to help with noise complaints that YVR Security had received. A total of 16 initiatives were identified and are outlined in the Noise Management Plan. The plan is flexible and allows room for new community issues that may arise within the five-year program. The plan&#x27;s main goal is to balance the needs of having 24-hour airport services while minimizing noise disturbances associated with aircraft services for those living nearby.

===Operation Yellow Ribbon===

Following the September 11 attacks, the airspace over the United States was shut down. Aircraft over the North Atlantic and Pacific bound for the United States were therefore diverted to Canadian airports. Vancouver International Airport accommodated 34 of these flights (3rd highest after Halifax and Gander) amounting to a total of 8,500 passengers.

The airport won the 2001 Airport Management Award from the B.C. Aviation Council and was cited for overcoming many challenges in a professional and compassionate way.

==Emergency services==

YVR Fire &amp; Rescue is the primary fire service at the airport, responding to aircraft emergencies as well as medical and environmental emergencies on airport property. The airport fire station has seven Oshkosh Striker ARFF crash trucks, a Pierce Arrow XT Engine, and an F-550 medical truck that are owned by the Vancouver Airport Authority. Richmond Fire has additional resources when required from Richmond Fire Hall #4 (Sea Island) at 3900 Russ Baker Way, as well as the Canadian Coast Guard.

Policing at the airport is provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Richmond detachment. Airport emergency health services are provided by the British Columbia Ambulance Service, with Station 270 providing a dedicated bike squad for rapid EMS response to passengers and staff. In addition, BCAS air ambulance Station 280 is located near the YVR South Terminal, providing air ambulance service with two Sikorsky S-76 helicopters, two Beechcraft Super King Air turboprop aircraft, and one Cessna Citation Bravo jet.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On February 7, 1968, a Canadian Pacific Airlines Boeing 707 overran a runway and hit two buildings, vehicles, and parked aircraft while landing in heavy fog, killing one crew member and one person on the ground.
*On March 1, 1970, Vickers Viscount CF-THY of Air Canada collided in mid-air with an Ercoupe 415 CF-SHN on approach to Vancouver International Airport. The Ercoupe pilot was killed.
*On June 23, 1985, two pieces of unauthorized luggage containing bombs were checked in at the airport and loaded onto Canadian Pacific Airlines Flight 60 to Toronto and Canadian Pacific Airlines Flight 3 to Tokyo respectively. Upon exploding, the former killed all 329 on board Air India Flight 182, and the latter, intended for Air India Flight 301, exploded at Tokyo Narita International Airport, killing two baggage handlers.
*On August 19, 1995, Douglas C-47B (DC-3) C-GZOF of Air North crashed during an emergency return to the airport, killing one of the three crew. The aircraft was on a ferry flight to Prince Rupert Airport when the starboard propeller went into overspeed and the decision was made to return to Vancouver International.
*On October 19, 1995, a Canadian Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aborted takeoff on runway 26 (now 26L) two seconds after the V1 call. The aircraft ended up in the soft ground west of the end of runway, causing the failure of the nose gear. All 243 passengers and 14 crew escaped with no more than minor injuries.
*During the September 11 attacks, an Air China Boeing 747 from Beijing to San Francisco, was escorted by two U.S. F-15s onto the airport&#x27;s north runway during Operation Yellow Ribbon, apparently following a communication problem.
*On October 14, 2007, a Polish immigrant, Robert Dziekanski, died after being shot with a taser by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the airport. Dziekański, who did not speak English, became agitated after waiting approximately 10 hours at the arrivals hall because he could not find his mother. While police were attempting to take Dziekanski into custody he was tased by officers and subsequently died. The subsequent Braidwood Inquiry began in May 2008. In June 2010, the judge found that the use of the taser was not justified. The RCMP issued an apology to Dziekanski&#x27;s mother. The commission also found that tasers have the capability to injure or kill by causing heart irregularities, especially where the individual is medically or emotionally compromised.
* On October 19, 2007, at approximately 4:10pm, a Piper Seneca bound for Pitt Meadows Airport took off from YVR and crashed into a nearby apartment building in Richmond. The pilot was the sole occupant of the plane. He was killed in the crash. Two others were injured, both of whom were in the apartment building at the time.
* On September 18, 2008, in the afternoon, an Air Canada Airbus A340 collided with an Air Canada Jazz Dash 8 aircraft. The Jazz flight was taxiing on the runway when it collided. The Air Canada flight was bound for Hong Kong. Both aircraft received damage but there were no injuries or fatalities.
* On July 9, 2009, at approximately 10:08pm, a Piper Navajo airplane originating from Victoria crashed into an industrial area in Richmond, British Columbia. The two pilots were killed. It was owned and operated by Canadian Air Charters and was carrying units of blood for Canadian Blood Services at the time. Officials say that wake turbulence was the main cause of the crash. Fatigue, along with diminished depth perception in darkness, was also a factor.
* On October 27, 2011, a Northern Thunderbird Air Beechcraft King Air 100 attempted to land on the south runway but missed by about , hitting a lamppost and a car, then crashing on the nearby intersection on Russ Baker Way and Gilbert Road at the west end of the Dinsmore Bridge. There were seven passengers and two crew members on board; only the pilot was confirmed dead at 9:00pm that evening, while the others survived with various injuries. Two on the ground were also injured. On November 16, 2011, the co-pilot of the flight died in hospital.
* On May 9, 2021, a 28-year-old man was fatally shot outside the international terminal. The Integrated Homicide Investigation Team said the shooting was targeted and linked to ongoing Lower Mainland gang conflict in Metro Vancouver. Richmond RCMP pursued a suspect vehicle from the terminal to Lulu Island, where the suspects reportedly shot at police. The vehicle was later found burned-out in Surrey.
* On November 19, 2024, an Amazon Air Boeing 767-300F operated by Cargojet Airways overran the north runway and slid into the grass while landing around 1:45 am, causing substantial damage to the aircraft. No one was injured.

<text>The People&#x27;s Party, usually known as the Populist Party or simply the Populists, was an agrarian populist political party in the United States in the late 19th century. The Populist Party emerged in the early 1890s as an important force in the Southern and Western United States, but declined rapidly after the 1896 United States presidential election in which most of its natural constituency was absorbed by the Bryan wing of the Democratic Party. A rump faction of the party continued to operate into the first decade of the 20th century, but never matched the popularity of the party in the early 1890s.

The Populist Party&#x27;s roots lay in the Farmers&#x27; Alliance, an agrarian movement that promoted economic action during the Gilded Age, as well as the Greenback Party, an earlier third party that had advocated fiat money. The success of Farmers&#x27; Alliance candidates in the 1890 elections, along with the conservatism of both major parties, encouraged Farmers&#x27; Alliance leaders to establish a full-fledged third party before the 1892 elections. The Ocala Demands laid out the Populist platform: collective bargaining, federal regulation of railroad rates, an expansionary monetary policy, and a Sub-Treasury Plan that required the establishment of federally controlled warehouses to aid farmers. Other Populist-endorsed measures included bimetallism, a graduated income tax, direct election of Senators, a shorter workweek, and the establishment of a postal savings system. These measures were collectively designed to curb the influence of monopolistic corporate and financial interests and empower small businesses, farmers and laborers.

In the 1892 presidential election, the Populist ticket of James B. Weaver and James G. Field won 8.5% of the popular vote and carried four Western states, becoming the first third party since the end of the American Civil War to win electoral votes. Despite the support of labor organizers such as Eugene V. Debs and Terence V. Powderly, the party largely failed to win the vote of urban laborers in the Midwest and the Northeast. Over the next four years, the party continued to run state and federal candidates, building up powerful organizations in several Southern and Western states. Before the 1896 presidential election, the Populists became increasingly polarized between &quot;fusionists,&quot; who wanted to nominate a joint presidential ticket with the Democratic Party, and &quot;mid-roaders,&quot; such as Mary Elizabeth Lease, who favored the continuation of the Populists as an independent third party. After the 1896 Democratic National Convention nominated William Jennings Bryan, a prominent bimetallist, the Populists also nominated Bryan but rejected the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in favor of party leader Thomas E. Watson. In the 1896 election, Bryan swept the South and West but lost to Republican William McKinley by a decisive margin.

After the 1896 presidential election, the Populist Party suffered a nationwide collapse. The party nominated presidential candidates in the three presidential elections after 1896, but none came close to matching Weaver&#x27;s performance in 1892. Former Populists became inactive or joined other parties. Other than Debs and Bryan, few politicians associated with the Populists retained national prominence.

Historians see the Populists as a reaction to the power of corporate interests in the Gilded Age, but they debate the degree to which the Populists were anti-modern and nativist. Scholars also continue to debate the magnitude of influence the Populists exerted on later organizations and movements, such as the progressives of the early 20th century. Most of the Progressives, such as Theodore Roosevelt, Robert La Follette, and Woodrow Wilson, were bitter enemies of the Populists. In American political rhetoric, &quot;populist&quot; was originally associated with the Populist Party and related to left-wing movements, but beginning in the 1950s it began to take on a more generic meaning, describing any anti-establishment movement regardless of its position on the left–right political spectrum.

== Origins ==

=== Third party antecedents ===

Ideologically, the Populist Party originated in the debate over monetary policy in the aftermath of the American Civil War. In order to fund that war, the U.S. government had left the gold standard by issuing fiat paper currency known as Greenbacks. After the war, the Eastern financial establishment strongly favored a return to the gold standard for both ideological reasons (they believed that money must be backed by gold which, they argued, had intrinsic value) and economic gain (a return to the gold standard would make their government bonds more valuable). Successive presidential administrations favored &quot;hard money&quot; policies that retired the greenbacks, thereby shrinking the amount of currency in circulation. Financial interests also won passage of the Coinage Act of 1873, which barred the coinage of silver, thereby ending a policy of bimetallism. The deflation caused by these policies affected farmers especially strongly, since deflation made it more difficult to pay debts and led to lower prices for agricultural products.

Angered by these developments, some farmers and other groups began calling for the government to permanently adopt fiat currency. These advocates of &quot;soft money&quot; were influenced by economist Edward Kellogg and Alexander Campbell, both of whom advocated for fiat money issued by a central bank. Despite fierce partisan rivalries, the two major parties were both closely allied with business interests and supported largely similar economic policies, including the gold standard. The Democratic Party&#x27;s 1868 platform endorsed the continued use of greenbacks, but the party embraced hard money policies after the 1868 election.

Though soft money forces were able to win some support in the West, launching a third party proved difficult in the rest of the country. The United States was deeply polarized by the sectional politics of the post-Civil War era; most Northerners remained firmly attached to the Republican Party, while most Southerners identified with the Democratic Party. In the 1870s, advocates of soft money formed the Greenback Party, which called for the continued use of paper money as well as the restoration of bimetallism. Greenback nominee James B. Weaver won over three percent of the vote in the 1880 presidential election, but the Greenback Party was unable to build a durable base of support, and it collapsed in the 1880s. Many former Greenback Party supporters joined the Union Labor Party, but it also failed to win widespread support.

=== Farmer&#x27;s Alliance ===

A group of farmers formed the Farmers&#x27; Alliance in Lampasas, Texas in 1877, and the organization quickly spread to surrounding counties. The Farmers&#x27; Alliance promoted collective economic action by farmers in order to cope with the crop-lien system, which left economic power in the hands of a mercantile elite that furnished goods on credit. The movement became increasingly popular throughout Texas in the mid-1880s, and membership in the organization grew from 10,000 in 1884 to 50,000 at the end of 1885. At the same time, the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance became increasingly politicized, with members attacking the &quot;money trust&quot; as the source and beneficiary of both the crop lien system and deflation. In the hopes of cementing an alliance with labor groups, the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance supported the Knights of Labor in the Great Southwest railroad strike of 1886. That same year, a Farmer&#x27;s Alliance convention issued the Cleburne Demands, a series of resolutions that called for, among other things, collective bargaining, federal regulation of railroad rates, an expansionary monetary policy, and a national banking system administered by the federal government.

President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s veto of a Texas seed bill in early 1887 outraged many farmers, encouraging the growth of a northern Farmer&#x27;s Alliance in states like Kansas and Nebraska. That same year, a prolonged drought began in the West, contributing to the bankruptcy of many farmers. In 1887, the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance merged with the Louisiana Farmers Union and expanded into the South and the Great Plains. In 1889, Charles Macune launched the &quot;National Economist&quot;, which became the national paper of the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance.

Macune and other Farmer&#x27;s Alliance leaders helped organize a December 1889 convention in St. Louis; the convention met with the goal of forming a confederation of the major farm and labor organizations. Though a full merger was not achieved, the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance and the Knights of Labor jointly endorsed the St. Louis Platform, which included many of the long-standing demands of the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance. The Platform added a call for Macune&#x27;s &quot;Sub-Treasury Plan,&quot; under which the federal government would establish warehouses in agricultural counties; farmers would be allowed to store their crops in these warehouses and borrow up to 80 percent of the value of their crops. The movement began to expand into the Northeast and the Great Lakes region, while Macune led the establishment of the National Reform Press Association, a network of newspapers sympathetic to the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance.

== Formation ==

The Farmer&#x27;s Alliance had initially sought to work within the two-party system, but by 1891 many party leaders had become convinced of the need for a third party that could challenge the conservatism of both major parties. In the 1890 elections, Farmer&#x27;s Alliance-backed candidates won dozens of races for the U.S. House of Representatives and gained majorities in several state legislatures. Many of these individuals were elected in coalition with Democrats; in Nebraska, the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance forged an alliance with newly elected Congressman William Jennings Bryan, while in Tennessee, local Farmer&#x27;s Alliance leader John P. Buchanan was elected governor on the Democratic ticket. As most leading Democrats refused to endorse the Sub-Treasury, many leaders of the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance remained dissatisfied with both major parties.

In December 1890, a Farmer&#x27;s Alliance convention re-stated the organization&#x27;s platform with the Ocala Demands; Farmer&#x27;s Alliance leaders also agreed to hold another convention in early 1892 to discuss the possibility of establishing a third party if Democrats failed to adopt their policy goals. Among those who favored the establishment of a third party were Farmer&#x27;s Alliance president Leonidas L. Polk, Georgia newspaper editor Thomas E. Watson, and former Congressman Ignatius L. Donnelly of Minnesota.
The February 1892 Farmer&#x27;s Alliance convention was attended by supporters of Edward Bellamy and Henry George, as well as current and former members of the Greenback Party, Prohibition Party, Anti-Monopoly Party, Labor Reform Party, Union Labor Party, United Labor Party, Workingmen Party, and dozens of other minor parties. Delivering the final speech of the convention, Ignatius L. Donnelly, stated, &quot;We meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral, political, and material ruin. ... We seek to restore the government of the republic to the hands of the &#x27;plain people&#x27; with whom it originated. Our doors are open to all points of the compass. ... The interests of rural and urban labor are the same; their enemies are identical.&quot; Following Donnelly&#x27;s speech, delegates agreed to establish the People&#x27;s Party and hold a presidential nominating convention on July 4 in Omaha, Nebraska. Journalists covering the fledgling party began referring to it as the &quot;Populist Party,&quot; and that term quickly became widely popular.

== 1892 election ==

The initial front-runner for the Populist Party&#x27;s presidential nomination was Leonidas L. Polk, who had served as the chairman of the convention in St. Louis, but he died of an illness weeks before the Populist convention. The party instead turned to former Union General and 1880 Greenback presidential nominee James B. Weaver of Iowa, nominating him on a ticket with former Confederate army officer James G. Field of Virginia. The convention agreed to a party platform known as the Omaha Platform, which proposed the implementation of the Sub-Treasury and other longtime Farmer&#x27;s Alliance goals. The platform also called for a graduated income tax, direct election of Senators, a shorter workweek, restrictions on immigration to the United States, and public ownership of railroads and communication lines.

The Populists appealed most strongly to voters in the South, the Great Plains, and the Rocky Mountains. In the Rocky Mountains, Populist voters were motivated by support for free silver (bimetallism), opposition to the power of railroads, and clashes with large landowners over water rights. In the South and the Great Plains, Populists had a broad appeal among farmers, but relatively little support in cities and towns. Businessmen and, to a lesser extent, skilled craftsmen were appalled by the perceived radicalism of Populist proposals. Even in rural areas, many voters resisted casting aside their long-standing partisan allegiances. Turner concludes that Populism appealed most strongly to economically distressed farmers who were isolated from urban centers. Linda Slaughter, a prominent women&#x27;s rights advocate from the Dakota Territory, also participated in the convention, making her the first American woman to vote for a presidential candidate at a national convention.

One of the Populist Party&#x27;s central goals was to create a coalition between farmers in the South and West and urban laborers in the Midwest and Northeast. In the latter regions, the Populists received the support of union officials like Knights of Labor leader Terrence Powderly and railroad organizer Eugene V. Debs, as well as author Edward Bellamy&#x27;s Nationalist Clubs. But the Populists lacked compelling campaign planks that appealed specifically to urban laborers, and were largely unable to mobilize support in urban areas. Corporate leaders had largely been successful in preventing labor from organizing politically and economically, and union membership did not rival that of the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance. Some unions, including the fledgling American Federation of Labor, refused to endorse any political party. Populists were also largely unable to win the support of farmers in the Northeast and the more developed parts of the Midwest.

In the 1892 presidential election, Democratic nominee Grover Cleveland, a strong supporter of the gold standard, defeated incumbent Republican President Benjamin Harrison. Weaver won over one million votes, carried Colorado, Kansas, Idaho, and Nevada, and received electoral votes from Oregon and North Dakota. He was the first third-party candidate since the Civil War to win electoral votes, while Field was the first Southern candidate to win electoral votes since the 1872 election. The Populists performed strongly in the West, but many party leaders were disappointed by the results in parts of the South and the entire Great Lakes Region. Weaver failed to win more than 5% of the vote in any state east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mason–Dixon line.

== Between presidential elections, 1893–1895 ==
Shortly after Cleveland took office, the country fell into a deep recession known as the Panic of 1893. In response, Cleveland and his Democratic allies repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act and passed the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act, which provided for a minor reduction in tariff rates. The Populists denounced the Cleveland administration&#x27;s continued adherence to the gold standard, and they angrily attacked the administration&#x27;s decision to purchase gold from a syndicate led by J. P. Morgan. Millions fell into unemployment and poverty, and groups like Coxey&#x27;s Army organized protest marches in Washington, D.C. Party membership grew in several states; historian Lawrence Goodwyn estimates that in the mid-1890s the party had &quot;a following of anywhere from 25 to 45 percent of the electorate in twenty-odd states.&quot; Partly due to the growing popularity of the Populist movement, the Democratic Congress included a provision to re-implement a federal income tax in the 1894 Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act.

The Populists faced challenges from both the established major parties and the &quot;Silverites,&quot; who generally disregarded the Omaha Platform in favor of bimetallism. These Silverites, who formed groups like the Silver Party and the Silver Republican Party, became particularly strong in Western mining states like Nevada and Colorado. In Colorado, Populists elected Davis Hanson Waite as governor, but the party divided over the Waite&#x27;s refusal to break the Cripple Creek miners&#x27; strike of 1894. Silverites were also strong in Nebraska, where Democratic Congressman William Jennings Bryan continued to enjoy the support of many Nebraska Populists. A coalition of Democrats and Populists elected Populist William V. Allen to the Senate.

The 1894 elections were a massive defeat for the Democratic Party throughout the country, and a mixed result for the Populists. Populists performed poorly in the West and Midwest, where Republicans dominated, but won elections in Alabama and other states. In the aftermath, some party leaders, particularly those outside the South, became convinced of the need to fuse with Democrats and adopt bimetallism as the party&#x27;s key issue. Party chairman Herman Taubeneck declared that the party should abandon the Omaha Platform and &quot;unite the reform forces of the nation&quot; behind bimetallism. Meanwhile, leading Democrats increasingly distanced themselves from Cleveland&#x27;s gold standard policies in the aftermath of their performance in the 1894 elections.

The Populists became increasingly polarized between moderate &quot;fusionists&quot; like Taubeneck and radical &quot;mid-roaders&quot; (named for their desire to take a middle road between Democrats and Republicans) like Tom Watson. Fusionists believed the perceived radicalism of the Omaha Platform limited the party&#x27;s appeal, whereas a platform based on free silver would resonate with a wide array of groups. The mid-roaders believed that free silver did not represent serious economic reform, and continued to call for government ownership of railroads, major changes to the financial system, and resistance to the influence of large corporations. One Texas Populist wrote that free silver would &quot;leave undisturbed all the conditions which give rise to the undue concentration of wealth. The so-called silver party may prove a veritable Trojan Horse if we are not careful.&quot; In an attempt to get the party to repudiate the Omaha Platform in favor of free silver, Taubeneck called a party convention in December 1894. Rather than repudiating the Omaha Platform, the convention expanded it to include a call for the municipal ownership of public utilities.

=== Populist-Republican fusion in North Carolina ===

In 1894–1896, the Populist wave of agrarian unrest swept through the cotton and tobacco regions of the South. The most dramatic impact was in North Carolina, where the poor white farmers who comprised the Populist party formed a working coalition with the Republican Party, then largely controlled by blacks in the low country, and poor whites in the mountain districts. They took control of the state legislature in both 1894 and 1896, and the governorship in 1896. Restrictive rules on voting were repealed. In 1895 the legislature rewarded its black allies with patronage, naming 300 black magistrates in eastern districts, as well as deputy sheriffs and city policemen. They also received some federal patronage from the coalition congressman, and state patronage from the governor.

=== Women and African Americans ===

Due to the prevailing racist attitudes of the late 19th century, any political alliance of Southern blacks and Southern whites was difficult to construct; however, shared economic concerns allowed some transracial coalition building. After 1886, black farmers started organizing local agricultural groups along the lines the Farmer&#x27;s Alliance advocated, and in 1888 the national Colored Alliance was established. 

Some southern Populists, including Watson, openly spoke of the need for poor blacks and poor whites to set aside their racial differences in the name of shared economic interests. The Populists followed the Prohibition Party in actively including women in their affairs. But regardless of these appeals, racism did not evade the People&#x27;s Party. Prominent Populist Party leaders such as Marion Butler at least partially demonstrated a dedication to the cause of white supremacy, and there appears to have been some support for this viewpoint in the party&#x27;s rank-and-file membership. After 1900 Watson himself became an outspoken white supremacist.

=== Conspiratorial tendencies ===

Historians continue to debate the degree to which the Populists were bigoted against foreigners and Jews. Members of the anti-Catholic American Protective Association were influential in California&#x27;s Populist Party organization, and some Populists embraced the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that the Rothschild family sought to control the United States. Historian Hasia Diner says:

: Some Populists believed that Jews made up a class of international financiers whose policies had ruined small family farms, they asserted, owned the banks and promoted the gold standard, the chief sources of their impoverishment. Agrarian radicalism posited the city as antithetical to American values, asserting that Jews were the essence of urban corruption.

== Presidential election of 1896 ==
In the lead-up to the 1896 presidential election, mid-roaders, fusionists, and free silver Democrats all maneuvered to put their favored candidates in the best position to win. Mid-roaders sought to ensure that the Populists would hold their national convention before that of the Democratic Party, thereby ensuring that they could not be accused of dividing &quot;reform&quot; forces. Defying those hopes, Taubeneck arranged for the 1896 Populist National Convention to take place one week after the 1896 Democratic National Convention. Mid-roaders mobilized to defeat the fusionists; the &quot;Southern Mercury&quot; urged readers to nominate convention delegates who would &quot;support the Omaha Platform in its entirety.&quot; As most of the party&#x27;s high-ranking officeholders were fusionists, the mid-roaders faced difficulty in uniting around a candidate.

The 1896 Republican National Convention nominated William McKinley, a long-time Republican leader who was best known for leading the passage of 1890 McKinley Tariff. McKinley initially sought to downplay the gold standard in favor of campaigning on higher tariff rates, but he agreed to fully endorse the gold standard at the insistence of Republican donors and party leaders. Meeting later in the year, the 1896 Democratic National Convention nominated William Jennings Bryan for president after Bryan&#x27;s Cross of Gold speech galvanized the party behind free silver. For vice president, the party nominated conservative shipping magnate Arthur Sewall.

When the Populist convention met, fusionists proposed that the Populists nominate the Democratic ticket, while mid-roaders organized to defeat fusionist efforts. As Sewall was objectionable to many within the party, the mid-roaders successfully moved a motion to nominate the vice president first. Despite a telegram from Bryan indicating that he would not accept the Populist nomination if the party did not also nominate Sewall, the convention chose Tom Watson as the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee. The convention also reaffirmed the major planks of the 1892 platform and added support for initiatives and referendums. When the convention&#x27;s presidential ballot began, it was still unclear whether Bryan would be nominated for president and whether Bryan would accept the nomination if offered. Mid-roaders put forward their own candidate, obscure newspaper editor S. F. Norton, but Norton was unable to win the support of many delegates. After a long and contentious series of roll call votes, Bryan won the Populist presidential nomination, taking 1042 votes to Norton&#x27;s 321 votes.

Despite his earlier proclamation, Bryan accepted the Populist nomination. Facing a massive financial and organizational disadvantage, Bryan embarked on a campaign that took him across the country. He largely ignored major cities and the Northeast, instead focusing on the Midwest, which he hoped to win in conjunction with the Great Plains, the Far West, and the South. Watson, ostensibly Bryan&#x27;s running mate, campaigned on a platform of &quot;Straight Populism&quot; and frequently attacked Sewall as an agent for &quot;the banks and railroads.&quot; He delivered several speeches in Texas and the Midwest before returning to his home in Georgia for the remainder of the election.

Ultimately, McKinley won a decisive majority of the electoral vote and became the first presidential candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since the 1876 presidential election. Bryan swept the old Populist strongholds in the West and South, and added the silverite states in the West, but did poorly in the industrial heartland. His strength was largely based on the traditional Democratic vote, but he lost many German Catholics and members of the middle class. Historians believe his defeat was partly attributable to the tactics Bryan used; he had aggressively &quot;run&quot; for president, while traditional candidates would use &quot;front porch campaigns.&quot; The united opposition of nearly all business leaders and most religious leaders also hurt his candidacy, as did his poor showing among Catholic groups who were alienated by Bryan&#x27;s emphasis on Protestant moral values.

== Collapse ==
The Populist movement never recovered from the failure of 1896, and national fusion with the Democrats proved disastrous to the party. In the Midwest, the Populist Party essentially merged into the Democratic Party before the end of the 1890s. In the South, the National Alliance with the Democrats sapped the Populists&#x27; ability to remain independent. Tennessee&#x27;s Populist Party was demoralized by a diminishing membership, and puzzled and split by the dilemma of whether to fight the state-level enemy (the Democrats) or the national foe (the Republicans and Wall Street). By 1900 the People&#x27;s Party of Tennessee was a shadow of what it once was. A similar pattern repeated throughout the South, where the Populist Party had previously sought alliances with the Republican Party against the dominant state Democrats, including in Watson&#x27;s Georgia.

In North Carolina, the state Democratic Party orchestrated a propaganda campaign in newspapers across the state, and created a brutal and violent white supremacy election campaign to defeat the North Carolina Populists and GOP, the Fusionist revolt in North Carolina collapsed in 1898, and white Democrats returned to power. The gravity of the crisis was underscored by a major race riot in Wilmington in 1898, two days after the election. Knowing they had just retaken control of the state legislature, the Democrats were confident they could not be overcome. They attacked and overcame the Fusionists; mobs roamed the black neighborhoods, shooting, killing, burning buildings, and making a special target of the black newspaper. There were no further insurgencies in any Southern states involving a successful black coalition at the state level. By 1900, the gains of the populist-Republican coalition were reversed, and the Democrats ushered in disfranchisement: practically all blacks lost their vote, and the Populist-Republican alliance fell apart.

In 1900, many Populist voters supported Bryan again (though Marion Butler&#x27;s home county of Sampson swung heavily to Republican McKinley in a backlash against the state Democratic party), but the weakened party nominated a separate ticket of Wharton Barker and Ignatius L. Donnelly, and disbanded afterward. The prosperity of the first decade of the 1900s helped ensure that the party continued to fade away. Populist activists retired from politics, joined a major party, or followed Debs into the Socialist Party.

In 1904, the party was reorganized, and Watson was its nominee for president in 1904 and 1908, after which the party disbanded again.

In &quot;A Preface to Politics&quot;, published in 1913, Walter Lippmann wrote, &quot;As I write, a convention of the Populist Party has just taken place. Eight delegates attended the meeting, which was held in a parlor.&quot; This may record the last gasp of the party organization.

== Legacy ==
According to Gene Clanton&#x27;s study of Kansas, populism and progressivism had a few similarities but different bases of support. Both opposed trusts. Populism emerged earlier and came out of the farm community. It was radically egalitarian in favor. It was weak in the towns and cities except in labor unions. Progressivism, on the other hand, was a later movement. It emerged after the 1890s from the urban business and professional communities. Most of its activists had opposed populism. It was elitist, and emphasized education and expertise. Its goals were to enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and enlarge the opportunities for upward social mobility. However, some former Populists changed their emphasis after 1900 and supported progressive reforms.

=== Debate by historians ===

Since the 1890s, historians have vigorously debated the nature of Populism. Some historians see the populists as forward-looking liberal reformers, others as reactionaries trying to recapture an idyllic and utopian past. For some, they were radicals out to restructure American life, and for others, they were economically hard-pressed agrarians seeking government relief. Much recent scholarship emphasizes Populism&#x27;s debt to early American republicanism. Clanton (1991) stresses that Populism was &quot;the last significant expression of an old radical tradition that derived from Enlightenment sources that had been filtered through a political tradition that bore the distinct imprint of Jeffersonian, Jacksonian, and Lincolnian democracy.&quot; This tradition emphasized human rights over the cash nexus of the Gilded Age&#x27;s dominant ideology.

Frederick Jackson Turner and a succession of western historians depicted the Populists as responding to the closure of the frontier. Turner wrote:

: The Farmers&#x27; Alliance and the Populist demand for government ownership of the railroad is a phase of the same effort of the pioneer farmer, on his latest frontier. The proposals have taken increasing proportions in each region of Western Advance. Taken as a whole, Populism is a manifestation of the old pioneer ideals of the native American, with the added element of increasing readiness to utilize the national government to effect its ends.

The most influential scholar of Populism was John Donald Hicks, who emphasized economic pragmatism over ideals, presenting Populism as interest group politics, with have-nots demanding their fair share of America&#x27;s wealth which was being leeched off by nonproductive speculators. Hicks gave attention to the massive drought that ruined so many Kansas farmers in the 1880s, but also pointed to greed, financial manipulations, deflation in prices caused by the gold standard, high interest rates, mortgage foreclosures, and high railroad rates. Corruption accounted for such outrages and Populists presented popular control of government as the solution, a point that later students of republicanism emphasized. In the 1930s, C. Vann Woodward stressed the southern base, seeing the possibility of a black-and-white coalition of poor against the overbearing rich.

In the 1950s, scholars such as Richard Hofstadter portrayed the Populist movement as an irrational response of backward-looking farmers to the challenges of modernity. Though Hofstadter wrote that the Populists were the &quot;first modern political movement of practical importance in the United States to insist that the federal government had some responsibility for the common weal&quot;, he criticized the movement as anti-Semitic, conspiracy-minded, nativist, and grievance-based. According to Hofstadter, the antithesis of anti-modern Populism was the modernizing nature of Progressivism. Hofstadter noted that leading progressives like Theodore Roosevelt, Robert La Follette Sr., George Norris and Woodrow Wilson were vehement enemies of Populism, though Bryan cooperated with them and accepted the Populist nomination in 1896. Reichley (1992) sees the Populist Party primarily as a reaction to the decline of the political hegemony of white Protestant farmers; the share of farmers in the workforce had fallen from about 70% in the early 1830s to about 33% in the 1890s. Reichley argues that, while the Populist Party was founded in reaction to economic hardship, by the mid-1890s it was &quot;reacting not simply against the money power but against the whole world of cities and alien customs and loose living they felt was challenging the agrarian way of life.&quot;

Goodwyn (1976) and Postel (2007) reject the notion that the Populists were traditionalistic and anti-modern. Rather, they argue, the Populists aggressively sought self-consciously progressive goals. Goodwyn criticizes Hofstadter&#x27;s reliance on secondary sources to characterize the Populists, working instead with material generated by the Populists themselves. Goodwyn determines that the farmers&#x27; cooperatives gave rise to a Populist culture, and their efforts to free farmers from lien merchants revealed to them the political structure of the economy, which propelled them into politics. The Populists sought diffusion of scientific and technical knowledge, formed highly centralized organizations, launched large-scale incorporated businesses, and pressed for an array of state-centered reforms. Hundreds of thousands of women committed to Populism, seeking a more modern life, education, and employment in schools and offices. A large section of the labor movement looked to Populism for answers, forging a political coalition with farmers that gave impetus to the regulatory state. Progress, however, was also menacing and inhumane, Postel notes. White Populists embraced social-Darwinist notions of racial improvement, Chinese exclusion and separate-but-equal.

=== Influence on later movements ===

Populist voters remained active in the electorate long after 1896, but historians continue to debate which party, if any, absorbed the largest share of them. In a case study of California Populists, historian Michael Magliari found that Populist voters influenced reform movements in California&#x27;s Democratic Party and Socialist Party, but had a smaller impact on California&#x27;s Republican Party. In 1990, historian William F. Holmes wrote, &quot;an earlier generation of historians viewed Populism as the initiator of twentieth-century liberalism as manifested in Progressivism, but over the past two decades we have learned that fundamental differences separated the two movements.&quot; Most of the leading progressives (except Bryan) fiercely opposed Populism. Theodore Roosevelt, Norris, La Follette, William Allen White and Wilson all strongly opposed Populism. 

It is debated whether any Populist ideas made their way into the Democratic Party during the New Deal era. The New Deal farm programs were designed by experts (like Henry A. Wallace) who had nothing to do with Populism; the demand for such programs themselves, however, had been a populist demand. Michael Kazin&#x27;s &quot;The Populist Persuasion&quot; (1995) argues that Populism reflected a rhetorical style that manifested itself in spokesmen like Father Charles Coughlin in the 1930s and Governor George Wallace in the 1960s. In &quot;Where Did the Party Go? William Jennings Bryan, Hubert Humphrey, and the Jeffersonian Legacy&quot; (2006) and &quot;Politics on a Human Scale: The American Tradition of Decentralism&quot; (2013), Jeff Taylor argues that William Jennings Bryan&#x27;s liberalism was different from the New Deal liberalism of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. 

Thomas Frank points out the continuity between Populism and socialism in the USA, as many populists went on to become socialists and members of the Socialist Party of America, including Eugene Debs, a lot of the populist leadership and the newspaper &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;. In addition, a &quot;neo-populist&quot; movement persisted in the form of the Nonpartisan League of North Dakota. In general, many of the demands of Populists were eventually realised by later movements, including leaving the gold standard, a secret ballot, women&#x27;s suffrage, an income tax, an eight-hour workday, and farm programs.

Long after the dissolution of the Populist Party, other third parties, including a People&#x27;s Party founded in 1971, and a separate People&#x27;s Party founded in 2017 and a Populist Party founded in 1984, took on similar names. These parties were not directly related to the Populist Party.

=== Populism as a generic term ===

In the United States, the term &quot;populist&quot; originally referred to the Populist Party and related left-wing movements of the late 19th century that wanted to curtail the power of the corporate and financial establishment. Later, the term &quot;populist&quot; began to apply to any anti-establishment movement. The original generic definition of the term, which has held consistently since the emergence of its post-Populist Party genericness, describes a populist as &quot;a believer in the rights, wisdom, or virtues of the common people.&quot; In the 21st century, the term once again began to be used. Politicians as diverse as independent left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Republican President Donald Trump have been labeled populists.

<text>Clarence Linden &quot;Buster&quot; Crabbe II (; February 7, 1908 – April 23, 1983) was an American two-time Olympic swimmer and film and television actor. He won the 1932 Olympic gold medal for 400-meter freestyle swimming event, which launched his career on the silver screen and later television. He starred in a variety of popular feature films and movie serials released between 1933 and the 1950s, portraying the top three syndicated comic-strip heroes of the 1930s: Tarzan, Flash Gordon, and Buck Rogers. In 1983 Crabbe died of a heart attack in Arizona.
==Early life==
Crabbe was born February 7, 1908, to Edward Clinton Simmons Crabbe, a real estate broker, and Lucy Agnes (née McNamara) Crabbe, in Oakland, California. He had a brother, Edward Clinton Simmons Crabbe Jr. (1909–1972). Crabbe grew up in Hawaii and graduated from Punahou School in Honolulu. He then attended the University of Southern California, where he was the school&#x27;s first All-American swimmer (1931) and a 1931 NCAA freestyle titlist. He also became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity before graduating from USC in 1931.

==Olympic Games==



Crabbe competed in two Olympic Games as a swimmer. At the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, he won the bronze medal for the 1,500 meters freestyle, and at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he won the gold medal for the 400 meters freestyle when he beat Jean Taris of France by a tenth of a second.

==Acting career==
===Hollywood===

He is credited in some films as &quot;Larry Crabbe&quot; or &quot;Larry (Buster) Crabbe&quot;. His role in the &quot;Tarzan&quot; serial &quot;Tarzan the Fearless&quot; (1933) began a career in which Crabbe starred in more than a hundred films. In &quot;King of the Jungle&quot; (1933), &quot;Jungle Man&quot; (1941), and the serial &quot;King of the Congo&quot; (1952), he played typical &quot;jungle man&quot; roles. He starred in several popular films at this time, including &quot;The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi&quot; (1933), alongside Betty Grable, &quot;Search for Beauty&quot; (1934), and &quot;Daughter of Shanghai&quot; (1937) credited as Larry Crabbe.

In 1936, he was selected over several stars to play Flash Gordon in the first, very successful Universal Pictures &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serial, which was followed by two sequels released in 1938 and 1940. The series was later edited and shown extensively on American television during the 1950s and 1960s, then fully restored for home video release. He also starred as Buck Rogers for Universal, playing the role with dark hair, unlike his blonde hair for Flash Gordon. In 1939 Crabbe reunited with Grable for a lead role in the mainstream comedy &quot;Million Dollar Legs&quot;.

Crabbe starred at the Billy Rose&#x27;s Aquacade at the New York World&#x27;s Fair during its second year (1940), replacing fellow Olympic swimmer and Tarzan actor Johnny Weissmuller.

During World War II, Crabbe was put under contract by Producers Releasing Corporation for lead roles from 1942 to 1946. He portrayed a Western folk-hero version of Billy the Kid in 13 films, and Billy Carson in 23, along with Al St. John as his sidekick. As a 34-year-old married man, Crabbe had a draft deferment, but made Army training films for the field artillery at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, along with St. John. Crabbe also played some jungle roles for the studio.

Following the war, Crabbe appeared opposite Weissmuller as a rival in two jungle films, &quot;Swamp Fire&quot; (1946) and &quot;Captive Girl&quot; (1950). For his final multi-chapter movie serial, Crabbe returned to the jungle playing the role of Thun&#x27;da in &quot;King of the Congo&quot; (1952).

===Television===

Crabbe was frequently featured in archival footage in the children&#x27;s television program, &quot;The Gabby Hayes Show&quot;. Prior to his playing &quot;Captain Gallant&quot;, Crabbe had hosted the local New York City-based children&#x27;s film wraparound television series, &quot;The Buster Crabbe Show&quot;. It was set against the backdrop of a ranch foreman&#x27;s bunk house and featured Crabbe engaging his viewers with games, stories, craftmaking, hobbies, informational segments, and interviews with guest performers and personalities. This was in-between the reruns of old movie serials, westerns, and comedies. &quot;The Buster Crabbe Show&quot; was seen weekday evenings on WOR-TV (Channel 9) in New York City from Monday, March 12, 1951, to Friday, October 3, 1952. The series name was changed to &quot;Buster&#x27;s Buddies!&quot; and returned to the NYC airways on WJZ-TV (Channel 7) (now WABC) on Monday, September 21, 1953. The WJZ TV version of the series included a studio audience of kids, becoming more of a kids&#x27; variety show. Despite the addition of the studio audience and Crabbe&#x27;s personality, &quot;Buster&#x27;s Buddies!&quot; was not a hit, and it was canceled on Friday, March 26, 1954.

On September 28, 1952, &quot;Sports Final with Buster Crabbe&quot; debuted on WNBT-TV in New York City. Crabbe gave updates sports news from 11:15 to 11:20 p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays.

Crabbe starred in the syndicated television series, &quot;Captain Gallant of the Foreign Legion&quot; (1955 to 1957) as Captain Michael Gallant; the adventure series aired on NBC. His real-life son, Cullen Crabbe, appeared in the series as the character &quot;Cuffy Sanders&quot;.

Crabbe made regular television appearances, including an episode of the 1979 series &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, in which he played a retired fighter pilot named &quot;Brigadier Gordon&quot;, in honor of Flash Gordon. When Rogers (Gil Gerard) praises his flying, Gordon replies &quot;I&#x27;ve been doing that sort of thing since before you were born&quot;, not realizing Buck was actually born over 500 years earlier. (Indeed, Crabbe first played Buck Rogers in 1939, six years before Gerard&#x27;s birth.) Rogers responds &quot;You think so?&quot; to which Gordon replies &quot;Young man, I &quot;know&quot; so!&quot;

He was also in a TV spot for Continental Airlines, where Crabbe spies himself in an old Flash Gordon short being shown on board: &quot;I think I know that guy. He used to be my idol.&quot;

==Later years==
Crabbe&#x27;s Hollywood career waned somewhat in the 1950s and 1960s, and he became a stockbroker and businessman during this period. According to David Ragan&#x27;s &quot;Movie Stars of the &#x27;30s&quot;, Crabbe owned a Southern California swimming pool-building company in later years. In the mid-1950s, Crabbe purchased the Adirondack campus of the Adirondack-Florida School, which advertised itself as a swim camp, called Camp Meenahga, for boys aged eight to fourteen, with most of the campers coming from Montreal. He was also the aquatics director at the Concord Resort Hotel in New York State&#x27;s Catskill Mountains.

During this period, Buster joined the swimming pool company Cascade Industries in Edison, New Jersey. In his capacity as Vice President of Sales, promoter, and spokesman for Cascade, &quot;the world&#x27;s first &#x27;package pool&#x27; company&quot;, he attended shopping mall openings and fairgrounds, combining the promotion of his swim camps and Cascade&#x27;s vinyl liner for in-ground swimming pools. A pool line was named after him, and swimming pools were sold by &quot;Buster Crabbe Dealers&quot; throughout the eastern seaboard and southern states from 1952 until 1990.

Though he followed other pursuits, he never stopped acting. But his career in the 1950s, and later, was limited to low-budget films, including westerns such as &quot;Gunfighters of Abilene&quot; (1960) co-starring Barton MacLane, &quot;Arizona Raiders&quot; (1965) co-starring Audie Murphy, and &quot;The Bounty Killer&quot; (1965) co-starring Dan Duryea and Rod Cameron. Crabbe appeared as the father of a young swimmer in the comedy &quot;Swim Team&quot; (1979), and as a sheriff in the low-budget horror film &quot;Alien Dead&quot; (1980), followed by &quot;The Comeback Trail&quot; (1982), one year before his death. Crabbe also appeared in television commercials for Hormel Chili, Icy Hot, and the Magic Mold Bodyshirt, an upper body male girdle of sorts, which purportedly helped in weight loss. Through Icy Hot, he was actively involved in arthritis education. Despite his numerous film and television appearances, he is best remembered today as one of the original cinema action heroes of the 1930s and 1940s.

In the 1950s, two published comic book series were named after him. Eastern Color published 12 issues of &quot;Buster Crabbe Comics&quot; from 1951 to 1953, followed by Lev Gleason&#x27;s four issues of &quot;The Amazing Adventures of Buster Crabbe&quot; in 1954.

In 1965, he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. During his senior swimming career, Crabbe set 16 world and 35 national records. He continued swimming through his sixties and in 1971 set a world record in his age group.

==Personal life==
In 1933, he married Adah Virginia Held (1912–2004) and gave himself a year to make it as an actor. If he did not find employment as an actor in that period, he planned to start law school at the University of Southern California.

Crabbe and his wife had two daughters, Caren Lynn (&quot;Sande&quot;) and Susan, and a son, Cullen. In 1957, Sande died of anorexia nervosa aged 20.

He is the maternal grandfather of the college football coach Nick Holt.

==Death==

In 1983, at age 75, Crabbe died of a heart attack at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona. He is interred at Green Acres Memorial Park in Scottsdale.

<doc id="177023" wikidata="Q171255" url="?curid=177023" title="Cutty Sark">
<text>Cutty Sark is a British clipper ship. Built on the River Leven, Dumbarton, Scotland in 1869 for the Jock Willis Shipping Line, she was one of the last tea clippers to be built and one of the fastest, at the end of a long period of design development for this type of vessel, which ended as steamships took over their routes. She was named after the short shirt of the fictional witch in Robert Burns&#x27; poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;, first published in 1791.

After the big improvement in the fuel efficiency of steamships in 1866, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 gave them a shorter route to China, so &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; spent only a few years on the tea trade before turning to the trade in wool from Australia, where she held the record time to Britain for ten years. Continuing improvements in steam technology early in the 1880s meant that steamships also came to dominate the longer sailing route to Australia, and the ship was sold to the Portuguese company Ferreira and Co. in 1895 and renamed &quot;Ferreira&quot;. She continued as a cargo ship until purchased in 1922 by retired sea captain Wilfred Dowman, who used her as a training ship operating from Falmouth, Cornwall. After his death, &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was transferred to the Thames Nautical Training College, Greenhithe, in 1938 where she became an auxiliary cadet training ship alongside HMS &quot;Worcester&quot;. By 1954, she had ceased to be useful as a cadet ship and was transferred to permanent dry dock at Greenwich, London, for public display.

&quot;Cutty Sark&quot; is listed by National Historic Ships as part of the National Historic Fleet (the nautical equivalent of a Grade 1 Listed Building). She is one of only three remaining intact composite construction (wooden hull on an iron frame) ships from the nineteenth century, the others being the clipper , now in Port Adelaide, South Australia, and the warship in Chatham. The beached skeleton of &quot;Ambassador&quot;, of 1869 lying near Punta Arenas, Chile is the only other significant remnant of this construction method.

The ship has been damaged by fire twice in recent years, first on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation. She was restored and was reopened to the public on 25 April 2012. Funders for the Cutty Sark conservation project include: the Heritage Lottery Fund, the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Sammy Ofer Foundation, Greenwich Council, Greater London Authority, The Stavros Niarchos Foundation, Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd, Michael Edwards and Alisher Usmanov.

On 19 October 2014 she was damaged in a smaller fire.

&quot;Cutty Sark&quot; whisky derives its name from the ship. An image of the clipper appears on the label, and the maker formerly sponsored the Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race. The ship also inspired the name of the Saunders Roe Cutty Sark flying boat.

==Construction==

&quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was ordered by ship-owner John Willis, who operated a shipping company founded by his father. The company had several ships in the tea trade from China to Britain. Speed was an advantage to vessels carrying a high-value, seasonal product, such as tea. Faster ships could obtain higher rates of freight (the price paid to transport the cargo), and tea merchants would use the names of fast-sailing ships that had carried their products in their advertising. &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was ordered during a boom in building tea clippers in the period 1865–1869—something that was attributed to a substantial reduction in the import duties for tea. In 1868 the brand-new Aberdeen-built clipper, &quot;Thermopylae&quot;, set a record time of 61 days port to port on her maiden voyage from London to Melbourne and it was this design that Willis set out to better.

It is uncertain how the hull shape for &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was chosen. Willis chose Hercules Linton to design and build the ship but Willis already possessed another ship, &quot;The Tweed&quot;, which he considered to have exceptional performance. &quot;The Tweed&quot; (originally &quot;Punjaub&quot;) was a frigate designed by Oliver Lang based on the lines of an old French frigate, built in Bombay for the East India Company as a combination sail/paddle steamer. She and a sister ship were purchased by Willis, who promptly sold the second ship plus engines from &quot;The Tweed&quot; for more than he paid for both. &quot;The Tweed&quot; was then lengthened and operated as a fast sailing vessel, but was considered too big for the tea runs. Willis also commissioned two all-iron clippers with designs based upon &quot;The Tweed&quot;, &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en&quot; and &quot;Blackadder&quot;. Linton was taken to view &quot;The Tweed&quot; in dry dock.

Willis considered that &quot;The Tweed&quot;″s bow shape was responsible for her notable performance, and this form seems to have been adopted for &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;. Linton, however, felt that the stern was too barrel shaped and so gave &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; a squarer stern with less tumblehome. The broader stern increased the buoyancy of the ship&#x27;s stern, making it lift more in heavy seas so it was less likely that waves would break over the stern, and over the helmsman at the wheel. &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was given masts that followed the design of &quot;The Tweed&quot;, with similar good rake and the foremast on both placed further aft than usual.

A contract for &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;″s construction was signed on 1 February 1869 with the firm of Scott &amp; Linton, which had only been formed in May 1868. Their shipyard was at Dumbarton on the River Leven on a site previously occupied by shipbuilders William Denny &amp; Brothers. The contract required the ship to be completed within six months at a contracted price of £17 per ton and maximum size of 950 tons. This was a highly competitive price for an experimental, state-of-the-art vessel, and for a customer requiring the highest standards. Payment would be made in seven instalments as the ship progressed, but with a penalty of £5 for every day the ship was late. The ship was to be built to Lloyd&#x27;s A1 standard and her construction was supervised on behalf of Willis by Captain George Moodie, who would command her when completed. Construction delays occurred when the Lloyd&#x27;s inspectors required additional strengthening in the ship.

Work on the ship was suspended when Scott and Linton ran out of money to continue. Rather than simply liquidate the company, an arrangement was made for Denny&#x27;s to take over the contract and complete the ship, which was finally launched on 22 November 1869 by Captain Moodie&#x27;s wife. The ship was moved to Denny&#x27;s yard to have her masts fitted, and then on 20 December towed downriver to Greenock to have her running rigging installed. In the event, completing the ship meant the company&#x27;s creditors were owed even more money than when work had first been halted.
&quot;Cutty Sark&quot; has a registered length of , with a depth of hold of and a net tonnage of 921. The hull is one of the sharpest of all the tea clippers: she has a coefficient of under deck tonnage of 0.55, compared to &quot;Thermopylae&quot; at 0.58. &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;″s prismatic coefficient, another measure of hull sharpness, is 0.628; this allows comparison with US-built clippers studied by Howard I. Chapelle. After water-line length, the prismatic coefficient is the next most important determinant of potential hull speed. Unladen, or with a cargo of low density, ballast was required for stability. For example, when she was loaded with wool, 200 tons of ballast was carried. The largest wool cargo she ever carried was 900 tons&#x27; weight (the total of ballast and cargo of 1,100 tons is consistent with the estimated deadweight cargo capacity of 1,135 tons at 20-foot draught). The largest tea cargo carried was 615 tons&#x27; weight. Conversely, a dense cargo allowed full use of the deadweight capacity: if loaded with coal, she would usually carry 1,100 tons.

Broadly, the parts of the ship visible above the waterline were constructed from East India teak, while American rock elm was used for the ship&#x27;s bottom. The stem, , and sternpost, , were of teak while the rudder was of English oak. The keel was replaced in the 1920s with one constructed from pitch pine. The deck was made of thick teak while the &#x27;tween deck was yellow pine. The keel, , had on either side a garboard strake, , and then planking decreasing to at one-fifth the depth of the hold. Teak planking began at approximately the level of the bilge stringer. The hull was covered by Muntz metal sheeting up to the depth mark, and all the external timbers were secured by Muntz metal bolts to the internal iron frame. The wrought-iron frame was an innovation first experimented with in shipbuilding in the 1840s, and was the standard building method for tea clippers by the middle of the 1860s. It consisted of frames (vertical), beams (horizontal) and cross bracing (diagonal members).

The diagonally-braced iron frame made for a strong, rigid ship; diagonal members prevent racking (shearing, where frame rectangles become parallelograms). Less working and leaking of the hull meant less crew time spent pumping, allowing more time to be spent on changes of sail. The wrought-iron-framed hull also took up less cargo space than an all-wood hull would have done. The Muntz metal sheeting reduced fouling of &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;″s hull; with a cleaner hull, she could sail faster.

==Performance==

The maximum logged speed for &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was . Her greatest recorded distance in noon to noon sights was averaging , although she recorded in six days, which given the weather over the whole period implied she had achieved over some days. By comparison, &quot;Thermopylae&quot;″s best recorded 24-hour distance was . On another occasion she recorded in 11 days. &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was considered to have the edge in a heavier wind, and &quot;Thermopylae&quot; in a lighter wind.

==Name==
The ship was named after Cutty-sark, the nickname of the witch Nannie Dee in Robert Burns&#x27;s 1791 poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;. The ship&#x27;s figurehead, the original of which has been attributed to carver Fredrick Hellyer of Blackwall, is a stark white carving of a bare-breasted Nannie Dee with long black hair holding a grey horse&#x27;s tail in her hand. In the poem she wore a linen (Scots: a short chemise or undergarment), that she had been given as a child, which explains why it was &quot;cutty&quot;, or in other words far too short. The erotic sight of her dancing in such a short undergarment caused Tam to cry out &quot;Weel done, Cutty-sark&quot;, which subsequently became a well-known catchphrase. Originally, carvings by Hellyer of the other scantily clad witches followed behind the figurehead along the bow, but these were removed by Willis in deference to &#x27;good taste&#x27;. Tam o&#x27; Shanter riding &quot;Meg&quot; was to be seen along the ship&#x27;s quarter. The motto &quot;Where theres a will is a way&quot; was inscribed along the taffrail, with variable spaces enabling also the reading &quot;Where there(&#x27;)s a Willis away&quot;. &quot;The Tweed&quot;, which acted as a model for much of the ship which followed her, had a figurehead depicting Tam o&#x27; Shanter.

==History==
===First tea seasons===
&quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was destined for the tea trade, a seasonal trade of a high-value cargo from China to London. Though the &quot;premium&quot; or bonus paid to the ship that arrived with the first tea of the year was abandoned after the Great Tea Race of 1866, faster ships could usually obtain a higher price for transporting their cargoes than others. Her first roundtrip voyage under captain George Moodie began 16 February 1870 from London with a cargo of wine, spirits and beer bound for Shanghai. The return journey, carrying of tea from Shanghai, began 25 June, arriving 13 October in London via the Cape of Good Hope.

&quot;Cutty Sark&quot; sailed in eight &quot;tea seasons&quot;, from London to China and back.
===Competition from steamers===
&quot;Cutty Sark&quot;″s launch coincided with the opening of the Suez Canal to shipping in 1869. Her first trip encountered significant competition with steamships. The route from the Far East to London (and many other European ports) through the Suez Canal was shorter by about , compared to sailing round the Cape of Good Hope. The route round Africa is in excess of . Typically a clipper might log significantly more than that by planning her route for favourable winds. Whilst it was possible for a sailing vessel to take a tug through the canal, this was difficult and expensive. Furthermore, sailing conditions in the northern Red Sea were unsuited to the design of a tea clipper, so they still had to sail around Africa. The ability of a steamer to make, for example, continuously, versus the fastest clipper voyage averaging under over a longer distance, gave steamships not only a more predictable voyage time, but a substantially quicker one.

Less obviously, steamship design had taken a large step forward in 1866 with &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, using higher boiler pressure and a compound engine, so obtaining a large improvement in fuel efficiency. Ships of this type could compete with clippers before the Suez Canal opened.

When the tea clippers arrived in China in 1870, they found a big increase in the number of steamers, which were in high demand. The rate of freight to London that was given to steamers was nearly twice that paid to the sailing ships. Additionally, the insurance premium for a cargo of tea in a steamer was substantially less than for a sailing vessel. So successful were the steamers using the Suez Canal that, in 1871, 45 were built in Clyde shipyards alone for Far Eastern trade.

The numbers of tea clippers sailing to China each year steadily reduced, with many ships being sold and moving to general cargo work. Costs were kept to a minimum and rigs were often reduced to barque so that a smaller crew was needed.

===&quot;Thermopylae&quot;===
&quot;Cutty Sark&quot;″s well-known race against &quot;Thermopylae&quot; took place in 1872, the two ships leaving Shanghai together on 18 June. Both ships were of similar size: length, beam and depths were within of each other. The &quot;Thermopylae&quot; had a slightly larger capacity: 991 compared to 963 (GRT) or 948 compared to 921 (net). Two weeks later &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; had built up a lead of some , but then lost her rudder in a heavy gale after passing through the Sunda Strait. John Willis&#x27;s brother was on board the ship and ordered Moodie to put into Cape Town for repairs. Moodie refused, and instead the ship&#x27;s carpenter Henry Henderson constructed a new rudder from spare timbers and iron. This took six days, working in gales and heavy seas which meant the men were tossed about as they worked and the brazier used to heat the metal for working was spilled out, burning the captain&#x27;s son. The ship finally arrived in London on 18 October a week after &quot;Thermopylae&quot;, a total passage of 122 days. The captain and crew were commended for their performance and Henderson received a £50 bonus for his work. This was the closest &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; came to being first ship home but it was Moodie&#x27;s last trip as her captain before he transferred to steamships. He was replaced by Captain F. W. Moore.

===Later tea seasons===
Moore remained captain only for one round trip to China, taking 117 days for the return trip. This was 14 days longer than &quot;Thermopylae&quot; and 27 days longer than achieved by the iron ship &quot;Hallowe&#x27;en&quot; a few months later. Captain W. E. Tiptaft assumed command in 1873 achieving 118 days on his first return trip, but after the ship had to travel up the Yangtze River in search of a cargo. Steamships were now taking most of the tea. The following year the return journey took 122 days. In November 1877 the ship was anchored off Deal in the English Channel along with sixty other vessels, waiting out a great storm. The anchor failed to hold and &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was blown through the ships, damaging two others before grounding on a mud bank. Fortunately she was pulled clear by the tug &quot;Macgregor&quot; before too much damage was caused and she was towed to the Thames for repairs.

In December 1877 the ship sailed from London to Sydney, where she took on coal for Shanghai, arriving there in April. However, the ship was unable to find any cargo of tea for a return trip to London—the days of the tea race were over. The master, Captain Tiptaft, died in October while still in Shanghai and was replaced by the first mate, James Wallace. The ship now had to take different cargoes around the world, including coal, jute, castor oil and tea to Australia.

In 1880 yards were shortened and the stun&#x27;sails removed. Also in 1880 an incident occurred on board during which the First Mate Sidney Smith killed seaman John Francis. Smith was allowed to leave the ship at Anjer by Captain Wallace, causing the crew to cease work in protest. Wallace continued the voyage with six apprentices and four tradesmen but became becalmed in the Java Sea for three days. In desperation as matters moved from bad to worse, he committed suicide by jumping overboard and disappeared. He was replaced as Master by William Bruce, who proved to be a drunken incompetent who claimed pay for non-existent crewmen and managed to set sail with inadequate provisions, resulting in the crew starving. An inquiry in New York in April 1882 resulted in the captain and mate being suspended and replaced by Captain Moore, previously of &quot;Blackadder&quot;.

===Wool trade===
In December 1883, &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; departed Newcastle, New South Wales with 4,289 bales of wool and 12 casks of tallow, arriving in London in just 83 days. This was 25 days faster than her nearest rival that year and heralded the start of a new career taking Australian wool to Britain in time for the January wool sales.

From 1885 to 1893, &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was run between England and New South Wales under the agency of the Sydney-based Dangar, Gedye &amp; Co. In 1885 Richard Woodget was appointed captain on a salary of £186 per year (£23,729.80 in 2019 when adjusted for inflation) and continued to improve on the fastest trip record, achieving 77 days on his first outward trip and 73 days returning to Britain from Australia. He achieved this by taking a more southerly route than previously, to catch the strongest winds in the Roaring Forties despite having to face icebergs, gales and storms whipped up by the winds he sought. &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was the fastest ship on the wool trade for ten years. In July 1889 the log of the modern passenger steamship recorded that when steaming at 15 to 16 knots she was overtaken in the night by a sailing ship doing 17 knots, which proved to be &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;.
===As &quot;Ferreira&quot;===
Eventually steamships began to dominate the wool trade too and it ceased to be profitable for a sailing ship. In 1895 Jock Willis sold &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; to the Portuguese firm Joaquim Antunes Ferreira for £1,250. She was renamed &quot;Ferreira&quot; after the firm. Her crews referred to her as &quot;Pequena Camisola&quot; (&quot;little shirt&quot;, a straight translation of the Scots &quot;cutty sark&quot;).
The ship traded various cargoes between Portugal, Rio de Janeiro, New Orleans, Mozambique, Angola, and Britain. In May 1916 she was dismasted off the Cape of Good Hope because of the rolling of the ship in bad weather and had to be towed into Table Bay off Cape Town. Because of World War I, it was impossible to obtain suitable materials to replace the masts so she was re-rigged over 18 months to a barquentine sail arrangement.

In 1922 &quot;Ferreira&quot; was the last clipper operating anywhere in the world. Caught in a storm in the English Channel she put into Falmouth harbour where she was spotted by retired merchant navy captain Wilfred Dowman of Flushing, Cornwall, who was then operating the training ship &quot;Lady of Avenel&quot;. The ship returned to Lisbon, where she was sold to new owners and renamed &quot;Maria do Amparo&quot; (Mary of the Refuge, a name associated with the devotion of Our Lady of the Refuge; in Portuguese, &quot;Nossa Senhora do Amparo&quot;).

===As cadet training ship===
Dowman persevered in his determination to buy the ship, which he did for £3,750 and she was returned to Falmouth harbour. The purchase was made with the support of Dowman&#x27;s wife, artist Catharine Dowman (), heiress daughter of Sydney Courtauld, crepe and silk manufacturer.

The rigging was restored to an approximation of the original arrangement and the ship was used as a cadet training ship. In 1924 she was used as committee boat for the regatta week in Fowey during that years regatta week as recalled to me by Mr. Arthur (Toby) West. As a historic survivor, the ship was opened to the public and visitors would be rowed out to inspect her. Dowman died in 1936 and the ship was given by Catharine Dowman, his widow, along with £5,000 for maintenance, to the Incorporated Thames Nautical Training College, HMS &quot;Worcester&quot; at Greenhithe. She was towed to Greenhithe by tug. The ship was crewed by cadets, 15-year-old Robert Wyld steering the ship during the voyage.
At Greenhithe, &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; acted as an auxiliary vessel to for sail training drill, but by 1950 she had become surplus to requirements. From February to October 1951 she was temporarily moved first for a refit and then to take part in the Festival of Britain at Deptford. On 30 January 1952, the 800-ton tanker collided with &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;″s bow in the Thames. The two ships were locked together after the collision which forced &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;″s jibboom into &quot;Worcester&quot;″s forecastle rails, snapping the boom before scraping along &quot;Worcester&quot;″s starboard side. &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;″s figurehead lost an arm in the process. Worcester was a condemned hulk, sunk at her moorings at the time, photographs showing her lying on her starboard side with her starboard side near the shore. &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was anchored and towed to the Shadwell Basin where repairs were carried out by Green &amp; Silley Weir Ltd. The damaged arm was recovered at Grays Thurrock and the figurehead was repaired.

==Museum ship==

In 1953 &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was given to the Cutty Sark Preservation Society and in 1954 she was moved to a custom-built dry dock at Greenwich. She was stripped of upper masts, yards, deck-houses and ballast to lighten her before being towed from the East India Import Dock to the special dry dock at Greenwich. The skipper on this occasion was 83-year-old Captain C.E. Irving, who had sailed the world three times in her before he was 17. The river pilot was Ernest Coe. Thereafter the entrance tunnel to the dry dock was filled in, the river wall rebuilt and the work of re-rigging began. The foundation stone of the dry dock was laid by The Duke of Edinburgh, patron of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society, in June 1953. The restoration, re-rigging and preparation for public exhibition was estimated to cost £250,000.

&quot;Cutty Sark&quot; was preserved as a museum ship, and has since become a popular tourist attraction, and part of the National Historic Fleet. She is located near the centre of Greenwich, in south-east London, close to the National Maritime Museum, the former Greenwich Hospital, and Greenwich Park. She is also a prominent landmark on the route of the London Marathon and marks the finish of The Big Half. She usually flies signal flags from her ensign halyard reading &quot;JKWS&quot;, which is the code representing &quot;Cutty Sark&quot; in the International Code of Signals, introduced in 1857.
The ship is in the care of the Cutty Sark Trust, whose president, the then Duke of Edinburgh, was instrumental in ensuring her preservation, when he set up the Cutty Sark Society in 1951. The Trust replaced the Society in 2000. She is a Grade I listed monument and was on the Buildings at Risk Register following the 2007 fire. The gallery beneath the ship holds the world&#x27;s largest collection of ships&#x27; figureheads, donated to the Society by Sydney Cumbers in 1953.

Cutty Sark station on the Docklands Light Railway is one minute&#x27;s walk away, with connections to central London and the London Underground. Greenwich Pier is next to the ship, and is served by scheduled river boats from piers in central London. A tourist information office stands to the east of the ship.

===Conservation and fire===
By the early 2000s, there were serious concerns about corrosion of the iron internal structure, and the hull was also becoming distorted because more weight was being carried on the keel than if the ship was afloat, when it would be evenly supported over the whole area below the waterline. An extensive conservation project was planned to overcome this, including repair and anti-corrosion painting of the framework and the addition of some additional steel ribs to add strength, and a new method of supporting the ship.

On the morning of 21 May 2007, &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;, which had been closed and partly dismantled for conservation work, caught fire, and burned for several hours before the London Fire Brigade could bring the fire under control. Initial reports indicated that the damage was extensive, with most of the wooden structure in the centre having been lost.

In an interview the next day, Richard Doughty, the chief executive of the Cutty Sark Trust, revealed that at least half of the &quot;fabric&quot; (timbers, etc.) of the ship had not been on site as it had been removed during the preservation work. Doughty stated that the trust was most worried about the state of iron framework to which the fabric was attached. He did not know how much more the ship would cost to restore, but estimated it at an additional £5–10 million, bringing the total cost of the ship&#x27;s restoration to £30–35 million.

In initial investigations, the possibility was covered that the fire might have been started deliberately. The fire was later found to have most likely been caused by an industrial vacuum cleaner which had been left running over the weekend, compounded by the absence of the overnight fire watchers.

In a second incident on the morning of 19 October 2014, another fire broke out on the deck of the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;. A small part of deck three and the hull timbers were damaged in the blaze. The London Fire Brigade managed to contain the blaze within an hour and she was reopened to the public shortly after.

====Damage====

Aerial video footage showed extensive damage, but seemed to indicate that the ship had not been destroyed in her entirety by the 2007 fire. A fire officer present at the scene said in a BBC interview that when they arrived, there had been &quot;a well-developed fire throughout the ship&quot;. The bow section looked to be relatively unscathed and the stern also appeared to have survived without major damage; the fire seemed to have been concentrated in the centre of the ship. The chairman of Cutty Sark Enterprises said after inspecting the site: &quot;The decks are unsalvageable but around 50% of the planking had already been removed; however, the damage is not as bad as originally expected.&quot;

As part of the restoration work planned before the fire, it was proposed that the ship be raised , to allow the construction of a state-of-the-art museum space beneath. This would allow visitors to view her from below.

There was criticism of the policies of the Cutty Sark Trust and its stance that the most important thing was to preserve as much as possible of the original fabric. Proponents of making her fit to go to sea advocated that the fire repairs be done in such a manner to enable her to do so.

However, the state of the timbers, especially the keel, and the fact that a hole had been cut through the hull in the 1950s for an access door, made this difficult. The Cutty Sark Trust said that less than five percent of the original fabric was lost in the fire, as the decks which were destroyed were additions not present at the original building.

The restoration work was criticised by The Victorian Society saying that the needs of the corporate hospitality market were put ahead of the preservation of the historic fabric of the ship. &quot;Building Design&quot; magazine awarded the project its Carbuncle Cup for the worst new building completed in 2012 saying &quot;The scheme&#x27;s myriad failings stem from one calamitous choice: the decision to hoick the 144-year-old clipper close to three metres into the air on canted steel props.&quot;

====Fundraising====
The design for the renovation project by Grimshaw architects with, during design development stage, newly established Youmeheshe architects and Buro Happold engineers involved raising the ship out of her dry berth using a Kevlar web, allowing visitors to pass under the hull to view it. Unfortunately it was discovered that the proposed web would not follow the reverse curves of the ship&#x27;s hull which would effectively mask the hull&#x27;s shape from view. An alternate design for the support of the ship had to be developed; this involved installing a deep steel belt around the hull tied by diagonal steel members passing through the hold to a new steel-reinforced keel. Horizontal tubular steel struts passing through the hold brace the diagonals apart while many of the corroded original hull frames have been doubled.

A new steelwork lower deck of contemporary design incorporating an amphitheatre feature was installed in the main hold while a glass-encased lift installed within the ship terminates in a new steel-and-glass housing structure on the weather deck. A second new steel-and-glass box has been installed above the forehold to enclose a new staircase. Access to the ship is through a new opening cut through the hull below the waterline in the ship&#x27;s starboard quarter. The new access hole has required the addition of new steel framing. Visitors arriving on board the ship now do so via this entrance, which leads to the lower hold. Maldwin Drummond, Chairman of the Cutty Sark Trust, has explained in &quot;Classic Boat&quot; magazine&#x27;s September 2010 issue the need to retain the spirit of the ship and he quotes the ideal that &quot;The visitor should see the ship as though for some unexplained reason the crew had gone ashore&quot;. Doubts over the wisdom of Grimshaw&#x27;s proposals have been raised by many ship conservationists including the Cutty Sark Trust&#x27;s own engineer Peter Mason.
The project was costed at £25 million when it commenced in 2006 with £11.75 million of this total being provided by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Oscar-winning film producer Jerry Bruckheimer aided in the repair and restoration of &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;. A collection of photos taken by Bruckheimer went on display in London in November 2007 to help raise money for the Cutty Sark Conservation Project. The exhibition featured more than thirty pictures taken on set during the filming of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;.

In January 2008, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the Cutty Sark Trust another £10 million towards the restoration of the ship, meaning that the Trust had now achieved £30 million of the £35 million needed for the completion of the project. In June 2008, Israeli shipping magnate Sammy Ofer donated the outstanding £3.3 million needed to fully restore the ship although by January 2009 the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; reported that the cost had risen further to £40 million creating a new shortfall.

In February 2010, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported the project cost had risen to £46 million with public money now being made available by London Borough of Greenwich to fill the funding gap.

====Investigation conclusion====

On 30 September 2008, the London Fire Brigade announced the conclusion of the investigation into the fire at a press conference at New Scotland Yard. The painstaking investigation was conducted by the Fire Brigade, along with London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Service, Forensic Science Services, and electrical examination experts Dr. Burgoyne&#x27;s &amp; Partners. They said that the most likely cause was the failure of an industrial vacuum cleaner that may have been left switched on over the weekend before the fire started. The report revealed no evidence that the ship was subjected to arson attack and concluded that the fire started accidentally.

Physical evidence and CCTV footage of the fire showed that it probably started towards the stern of the ship on the lower deck. All electrical equipment on board was examined and it was determined that an industrial vacuum cleaner in this area was normally running continuously to suck up dust and particles from work going on to break up concrete within the ship. No one working on the ship had responsibility to ensure all equipment was turned off at the end of each day, and no one recalled switching off the equipment on the Friday in question. The vacuum cleaner has three motors inside and after the fire one was found to be burned out in a manner which suggested it had failed while operating. This was not conclusive evidence, however, because the motor might previously have failed in service without causing a fire, and gone unnoticed because the other two motors had continued to function. Tests on similar cleaners showed they had no thermal cutout devices and while they could run safely indefinitely if filters inside were clear, if the airflow through the cleaner was blocked then it would eventually overheat and could catch fire. This might occur if the cleaner were full of dust and debris. The cleaner had failed previously and two motors had been replaced.

On the basis of witness evidence, the joint investigation team considered it unlikely that the fire was caused by the hot work (welding) that was being carried out as part of the renovation or by carelessly discarded smokers&#x27; materials. No one had visited this part of the ship since work stopped on Friday evening, and it was considered unlikely that a fire could have smouldered all weekend before finally breaking out Monday morning. However, it was discovered that although all hot work was supposed to be recorded and someone was supposed to check afterwards to ensure of no fires, there was no record that such checks had ever been made, and on at least one occasion hot work had been conducted with no records made.

The ship was patrolled by two security guards, both of whom were supposed to patrol independently at least once an hour, or once every two hours later in the night, one being primarily responsible for the visitor pavilion and one for the dock. The guards were required to keep a log of their patrols, but after the fire the relevant page was found to be missing from the book. It was later found, already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 a.m. when the guards would have gone off duty. The alarm was raised when one of the guards called the fire brigade; before this the two reported that they had smelled burning plastic and had been investigating to try to determine its source.

A carpenter had visited the site on Sunday to collect some tools, but after 20 minutes attempting to contact a security guard to let him in, had climbed the fence, collected his tools and climbed out again. The carpenter reported that he had heard machinery operating towards the stern of the ship, but it was not clear whether this might have been the site diesel generator which ran at all times.

The ship was fitted with a temporary fire alarm system but it was unclear whether this had operated. A separate alarm within the pavilion did sound when smoke and heat reached that area, but the guards reported no ringing alarm before the fire was seen. Investigation afterwards discovered a faulty relay in the alarm panel which failed to switch power to the siren circuits when an alarm was triggered. However, the panel also contained a failed fuse in one siren circuit which suggested that the siren had activated but the fire shorted it out, and this might have also caused the relay to fail. The failed relay would have shut off power to the second siren circuit. Statements from workers suggested that weekly tests of the alarm system had not been carried out.

==Mast specifications==

The original mast specifications as laid down by the ship&#x27;s designer still exist and are listed below as &quot;tea rig&quot;. This arrangement was used during the ship&#x27;s time on the tea trade route, where it was necessary to maximise the area of sail to get the greatest possible propulsion when the ship might be becalmed in the doldrums. For the route to Australia it was not necessary to carry such a large area of sail and the masts and yards were reduced. The tradewinds required great strength in masts, but the wind could best be captured by relatively small, high sails. A smaller rig also represented a saving in maintenance and operation costs. Each of the three masts (fore, main and mizzen) is in three overlapping sections.

<text>Eric Martin Andrew Banadinović (born 9 August 1968), known professionally as Eric Bana (), is an Australian actor. He began his career in the sketch-comedy series &quot;Full Frontal&quot; before gaining notice in the comedy drama &quot;The Castle&quot; (1997) and the biographical crime film &quot;Chopper&quot; (2000). 

After a decade of roles in Australian television shows and films, Bana gained Hollywood&#x27;s attention for his performance in the war film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001) and for playing Bruce Banner in the superhero film &quot;Hulk&quot; (2003). He played Hector in the war epic &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), and took a leading role in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s historical thriller &quot;Munich&quot; (2005). In 2009, he played the villain Nero in the science-fiction film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which was a critical and commercial success. Bana continued to work steadily in the 2010s, portraying Lieutenant Commander Erik S. Kristensen in &quot;Lone Survivor&quot; (2013), and playing police Sergeant Ralph Sarchie in the horror film &quot;Deliver Us from Evil&quot; (2014). In 2018, Bana played the title role in a true crime miniseries, &quot;Dirty John&quot;. In 2020, he returned to Australia to star in outback thriller &quot;The Dry&quot;.

Bana is the recipient of several Australian Film Institute awards and has performed distinctive lead and character roles across a wide spectrum of genres—from epics, to science fiction and action thrillers. In addition to acting, Bana is a motor-racing enthusiast, and has participated in various racing competitions in Australia. Bana was appointed Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for his services to drama.

His father Ivan was Croatian, born in Zagreb, and worked as a logistics manager for Caterpillar Inc., and his German mother, Eleanor, was a hairdresser, originally from near Mannheim in Germany. He has one older brother, Anthony. He has stated: &quot;I have always been proud of my origin, which had a big influence on my upbringing. I have always been in the company of people of European origin&quot;. He was raised Catholic.

Bana was raised in Melbourne&#x27;s Tullamarine, a suburban area on the northern edge of the city, and attended Penleigh and Essendon Grammar School. 

Showing acting skill early in life, Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather&#x27;s walk, voice, and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film &quot;Mad Max&quot;, and decided he wanted to become an actor. He did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991, though, when he was persuaded to try comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne&#x27;s Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, however, so he continued his work as a barman and waiting on tables.

==Career==
===1993–1997: Beginnings===
In 1993, Bana made his television debut on Steve Vizard&#x27;s late-night talk show, &quot;Tonight Live&quot;. His performance gained the attention of producers from the sketch-comedy series, &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, who invited him to join the show as a writer and performer. During his four years on the show, Bana wrote much of his own material, and based some of his characters on members of his family. His impressions of Columbo, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Tom Cruise, and Australian TV personality Ray Martin made Bana popular with the show&#x27;s audience. This success led him to record the comedy album &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; in 1994 and to host his own television special, titled &quot;Eric&quot;, in 1996. The show, a collection of sketches featuring everyday characters, prompted him to launch a sketch comedy series &quot;The Eric Bana Show&quot;. The series, written and performed by Bana, featured skits, stand-up, and celebrity guests, but failed to attract a substantial audience and was cancelled after only eight episodes due to low ratings. Even so, in 1997, he received a Logie Award for &quot;Most Popular Comedy Personality&quot; for his work on the show.

In that same year, Bana made his film debut in the Australian film &quot;The Castle&quot;, which tells the story of a Melbourne-based family&#x27;s struggles to keep their home by Melbourne&#x27;s airport, as the airport authority force them to move. He was featured in a supporting role as Con Petropoulous, a kickboxing accountant who is the householder&#x27;s son-in-law. &quot;The Castle&quot; was a surprise critical and financial success, earning A$10,326,428 at the box office in Australia.

===1998–2004: Hollywood breakthrough===
In 1997, despite his inexperience with dramatic roles, Bana was approached by director Andrew Dominik to appear in the film &quot;Chopper&quot; (2000), a biographical film based on the life of infamous Australian criminal Chopper Read. Dominik had been working on the project for five years, but was unable to find an actor to portray Read. Only after Read himself suggested Bana, having seen him perform a skit on television, did Dominik consider him for the part.

For the role, Bana shaved his head, gained , and spent two days with Read to perfect his mimicry. During filming, he arrived on set at 4am and spent five hours being covered in Read&#x27;s trademark tattoos. In spite of the film&#x27;s limited release outside of Australia, Bana&#x27;s performance received positive reviews. American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana, stating that &quot;in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found, I think, a future star [...] He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match. You cannot look away from him&quot;. &quot;Chopper&quot; was a critical and financial success in Australia, and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001. Bana&#x27;s performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.

In 2001, director Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American soldier in the film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001). Scott, with a recommendation from Russell Crowe and impressed by Bana&#x27;s performance in &quot;Chopper&quot;, did not require him to audition. In the film, he played Sergeant First Class Norm &quot;Hoot&quot; Hooten, an elite Delta Force soldier, who fights his way out of a battle in Mogadishu, Somalia, after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry. Bana shed the weight he had gained for &quot;Chopper&quot; and began an exercise regimen months before filming began. He also trained with Delta Force operators at Fort Bragg, learning to fire weapons and clear rooms. Between 2000 and 2001, Bana played Joe Sabatini in &quot;Something in the Air&quot;, an Australian soap opera set in a small town. After two seasons, Bana left the show to focus on his Hollywood career.

Bana&#x27;s next project was 2002&#x27;s low-budget Australian film &quot;The Nugget&quot;. A comedy, the film portrays the effect of instant wealth on three working-class men, and was released with moderate success in Australia. Bana read the script after filming &quot;Chopper&quot; in 2000, and was drawn to it because it reminded him of his childhood, and because he found its characters amusing and likable. While filming &quot;The Nugget&quot;, Bana was offered the lead role of Bruce Banner in the film adaptation of the popular Marvel comic book series &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;. Only after learning of director Ang Lee&#x27;s involvement in the project did he consider the role. Bana admired Lee for his work on the film &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; and agreed to work on the film before the final script was complete. He said he was drawn to the film because &quot;the character of Bruce Banner had dramatic potential&quot;, and was &quot;a fairly non-traditional superhero&quot;. Although &quot;Hulk&quot; (2003) received mixed reviews and was a moderate success at the box office, Bana&#x27;s performance was highly praised: Jack Matthews of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; felt that Bana played the role of Bruce Banner &quot;with great conviction&quot;.

In 2003, he voiced hammerhead shark Anchor in the critically and commercially acclaimed animated Pixar film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. In 2004, Bana co-starred with Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom in the war epic &quot;Troy&quot;. He portrayed Prince Hector, leader of the Trojan forces battling against the Greek warrior Achilles. When he read the script, he was drawn to Hector because, &quot;I really felt a lot for him. I felt he was just a wonderful character [...] Orlando I love to death, and we&#x27;ve worked together before and when he was cast as my younger brother, it was just a great feel and I hope that shows in the film.&quot; Bana also had prepared for the role by taking lessons in sword training and learning to ride horseback. Although &quot;Troy&quot;″s critical reaction was mixed, the film was a financial success, grossing US$497 million. Bana&#x27;s portrayal was well received; Stella Papamichael of the BBC thought he was &quot;magnetic&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Desson Thomson believed his &quot;touching&quot; performance.

===2005–2010: Historical films and &quot;Star Trek&quot;===

After the varied reception of &quot;Hulk&quot; and &quot;Troy&quot;, film critics questioned Bana&#x27;s bankability in big-budget films. He responded in &quot;Empire&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s not like it [&quot;Hulk&quot;] was a flop. When you&#x27;re on a long shoot, it is a long personal investment. If I wasn&#x27;t happy with the end result, I&#x27;d be bloody upset, but in every case so far, I&#x27;ve been happy. &quot;Troy&quot; could take $50 and I wouldn&#x27;t regret it.&quot;

The following year, 2005, Bana co-starred with Daniel Craig and Geoffrey Rush in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s controversial thriller &quot;Munich&quot;. Bana played Avner, a Mossad agent, who is ordered to track down and kill the Black September terrorists thought to be responsible for the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics. The film garnered praise from critics, and grossed $131 million worldwide. It was nominated for five Academy Awards in 2006. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Bana as Avner &quot;projects a combination of sensitivity and ruthlessness and [...] knows how to present a face for which worry is a new experience.&quot; &quot;The Telegraph&quot; was equally impressed with Bana&#x27;s emotional and &quot;sublimely convincing&quot; portrayal.

In 2006, Bana was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. &quot;Lucky You&quot;, a romantic comedy on which Bana worked before filming &quot;Munich&quot;, was released in early 2007. In the film, he played Huck Cheever, a professional poker player who must overcome his personal problems to win a high-stakes tournament in Las Vegas. &quot;Lucky You&quot; was negatively received; one critic opined that Bana&#x27;s performance &quot;simply isn&#x27;t appealing enough to make us care if he succeeds or fails.&quot; His next film was the Australian drama &quot;Romulus, My Father&quot; (2007). The film, based on Raimond Gaita&#x27;s memoir of the same title, portrays a couple and their struggle in the face of adversity to raise their son. Upon release, the film was a critical success, and Bana&#x27;s performance earned him a second Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.

Bana&#x27;s next project was the historical drama &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2008). In this feature, he played Henry VIII of England opposite Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. Bana was surprised to be offered the role and admitted that he &quot;probably would have just passed it on without even opening it&quot; if it had been presented to him under a different title. The following year, he co-starred with Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto in the science fiction film &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In the film, Bana played Nero, a Romulan mining ship captain who attempts to exact revenge on Spock, whom he blames for the destruction of his homeworld and its inhabitants. To prepare for the role, Bana shaved his head, and donned face tattoos; director J. J. Abrams was impressed with his villainous appearance. The film was positively received, and grossed over US$380 million worldwide. Bana later recalled, &quot;It was an unbelievable experience, and it&#x27;s such a great group of actors&quot;, but he did not reprise his role in the 2013 sequel, saying &quot;It was just a one-time for me.&quot;In 2009, he also appeared in the science fiction &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife,&quot; based on Audrey Niffenegger&#x27;s 2003 novel of the same title. Directed by Robert Schwentke, the film stars Rachel McAdams and Ron Livingston. The story follows Henry DeTamble (Bana), a Chicago librarian with a paranormal genetic disorder that causes him to randomly time travel as he tries to build a romantic relationship with Clare Abshire (McAdams), who would become his wife. While the film garnered mostly negative reviews, the critic from &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; complimented the chemistry between Bana and McAdams: &quot;Together they achieve an intimacy which does its best to distract you from the flaws in the script&quot;.

Bana co-starred with Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen in Judd Apatow&#x27;s 2009 feature about a famous comedian, &quot;Funny People&quot;, marking Bana&#x27;s first appearance in an American mainstream comedy. Rogen had cast Bana because he was a fan of his early television work, and impressed by his performance in &quot;Munich.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine gave the film 3½ out of 4 stars, and opined that Bana&#x27;s performance showed &quot;real comic flair&quot;. Also in 2009 Bana directed and starred in the documentary &quot;Love the Beast&quot;. It details his personal relationship with his first car, a Ford GT Falcon Coupe, and follows his progression as a car lover. Along the way, he seeks guidance and wisdom from his three lifelong friends, as well as celebrities Jay Leno, Jeremy Clarkson and Dr. Phil. Lastly, Bana provided the voice of Damien, a Greek Australian, in the animation &quot;Mary and Max&quot; (2009).

=== 2011–present: Career progression ===
In 2011, Bana played ex-CIA operative Erik Heller in the action thriller &quot;Hanna&quot;, starring alongside Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett. The film became a success for Bana as it opened at number two at the United States box office. Several media outlets praised Bana&#x27;s performance, with one critic describing it as having &quot;a note of haunted soulfulness&quot;. A year later, Bana starred in the &quot;Deadfall&quot;, a crime drama that follows two siblings who decide to fend for themselves after a failed casino heist. According to Metacritic, the film gained &quot;mixed or average reviews, but Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; magazine enjoyed Bana&#x27;s &quot;charismatic stone-cold killer character&quot;.

Bana portrayed Lieutenant Commander Erik S. Kristensen in &quot;Lone Survivor&quot; (2013). He said, &quot;Pete Berg [the director] and I nearly worked together many, many years ago before anyone knew who I was and we stayed in contact [...] he called me and told me he was making the film and would like me to play the mission commander Kristensen, I just jumped at the chance. I love the story. I thought it could potentially make a compelling movie and I knew that Pete was the right person for the job&quot;. Upon release, &quot;Lone Survivor&quot; grossed US$154.8 million at the worldwide box office. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine thought that Bana was well cast, and critic Mick LaSelle praised the actors for being &quot;convincing in their humanity, agony and ferocity&quot;. Bana then appeared in the thriller &quot;Closed Circuit&quot; (2013), alongside Rebecca Hall, as a lawyer, defending a Turkish man accused of planning a terrorist attack in London. Upon release, the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; critic thought Bana and Hall lacked chemistry. 

The following year, Bana starred as Ralph Sarchie, a police sergeant who investigates paranormal cases, in the supernatural horror &quot;Deliver Us from Evil&quot;. The film was released on 2 July 2014 and grossed US$87.9 million worldwide. Several critics disliked the film, including Donald Clarke of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; who thought Bana was miscast. In 2016, he played Frank Bonneville, a struggling radio journalist in Ricky Gervais&#x27;s &quot;Special Correspondents&quot;. It premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, and Netflix bought the rights to stream the film on its platform. Although reviews were largely negative, one reviewer thought Bana &quot;upstaged&quot; Gervais and gave a watchable performance. Bana also had a role in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Finest Hours&quot; (2016), playing Coast Guard warrant officer David Cluff. In that same year, Bana played doctor Stephen Grene in &quot;The Secret Scripture&quot;, based on the novel of the same title by Sebastian Barry. Although the film was poorly received, Sandra Hall from &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; thought Bana&#x27;s character showed &quot;quiet intensity&quot;.

In 2017, Bana took the role of Uther Pendragon, king of Britain and father of future King Arthur, in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot; (2017). In the same year, Bana starred in a British drama, &quot;The Forgiven&quot;, playing the murderer Piet Blomfield. &quot;The Forgiven&quot; gained a mixed reception; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic praised the acting but opined that the film was unfocused. In 2018, Bana played John in the Bravo miniseries &quot;Dirty John&quot;, based on the true crime podcast of the same name by Christopher Goffard. Creator Alexandra Cunningham said that Bana was her first choice for the lead role; Bana is very selective about picking the &quot;right&quot; characters. He said, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter what. Every film I&#x27;ve done, that&#x27;s always been the guiding decision-making thing, for sure.&quot; David Sexton of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; thought he was perfect: &quot;Bana is terrific as Dirty John, so sexy and appealing yet creepy too.&quot; In 2021, Bana starred in a mystery drama, &quot;The Dry&quot;, based on the book of the same name by Jane Harper. In that same year, Bana provided the voice of zookeeper Chaz in the animation &quot;Back to the Outback&quot;. In 2022, he voiced Monterey Jack in the animation &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;, and appeared in the drama &quot;Blueback&quot;; it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.

==Personal life==
On official identity documents he still has his birth surname, Banadinović.

In 1995 while working on the television series &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, Bana began dating Rebecca Gleeson, a publicist with the Seven Network and daughter of then Chief Justice of New South Wales, and later Chief Justice of Australia, Murray Gleeson. They married in 1997, after Bana proposed to her on a trip to the United States, which he won from &quot;Cleo Magazine&quot; after being named their &quot;Bachelor of the Year&quot; in 1996. Bana and Gleeson have two children together; Klaus (born, 1999) and Sophia (born, 2002). Klaus has graduated from VCA studying film while Sophia completed 2 years of full-time dance and continues to pursue a degree part-time at University of Melbourne. His sister-in-law is current High Court of Australia Judge Jacqueline Gleeson.

Bana was appointed Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for his services to drama.

===Interests and hobbies===
Bana is a motor racing enthusiast, and participates in various racing competitions in Australia. At the age of 14, he wanted to leave school to focus full-time on becoming a motor mechanic, but his father convinced him to complete school, advising him to avoid making his hobby a job. Bana purchased his first car, a 1974 XB Ford Falcon coupé, at the age of 15 for A$1,100 and, driving it, made his motor sport racing debut in Targa Tasmania 1996, a week-long race around Tasmania. In 2004, Bana purchased a Porsche 944 to compete in Australia&#x27;s Porsche Challenge. Competing throughout 2004 he often finished in the top ten and in November, finished fourth at the Sandown event, a personal best. On 21 April 2007, Bana crashed his 1974 XB Falcon Coupe in the 2007 Targa Tasmania rally; he and his co-driver were uninjured. Bana appeared on the British motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot; on 15 November 2009 as a guest for its &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; segment.

Bana is a prominent fan of Australian rules football. His love of the sport began at a young age when his godfather took him to games to see the St Kilda Football Club, his favourite team in the Australian Football League (AFL). Bana has been seen at AFL games when he is back in Australia. His love for St Kilda FC resulted in the club being featured in the film &quot;Funny People&quot; and in Bana&#x27;s promotion of the film in 2009, notably on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;. In 2010, Bana was named the &quot;Saints Number One Ticket Holder&quot;.

===Charity work===

Bana is an ambassador for Father Chris Riley&#x27;s charity for homeless young people, Youth Off The Streets, and has appeared with Riley in advertisements to support the organisation&#x27;s annual appeal.

In 2004, he appeared in several high-profile advertisements for the fellowship. Bana is also active in campaigns with the Australian Childhood Foundation and the Bone Marrow Donor Institute. Since 1995, he has participated in the Motorcycle Riders Association Toy Run in Melbourne, which raises money and toys for children in need at Christmas.

In 2005 Bana narrated the documentary &quot;Terrors of Tasmania&quot; about the endangered Tasmanian devil. The film followed the life of a female Tasmanian devil called Manganinnie and discussed the incurable facial cancer which threatens the survival of the species. He has also worked with RSPCA Australia, donating money to animal shelters in Berlin while filming &quot;Troy&quot; in 2004.

In 2007 Bana introduced the episode &quot;Some Meaning in This Life&quot; of the ABC-TV documentary series &quot;Australian Story&quot;. The episode paid tribute to actress Belinda Emmett, who co-starred with Bana in the film &quot;The Nugget&quot; and died from cancer the previous year. 

During the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, Bana voiced a series of radio and television advertisements to support donations to the Gippsland Emergency Relief Fund.

<doc id="177037" wikidata="Q5436931" url="?curid=177037" title="Fast Forward (Australian TV series)">
<text>Fast Forward was Australia&#x27;s highest-rating and most critically awarded commercial television sketch comedy show, broadcast for 90 one-hour episodes from 12 April 1989 to 26 November 1992.

The show was produced by Steve Vizard, who was also the executive producer, writer, and performer, and starred Jane Turner, Gina Riley, Magda Szubanski (the three of whom went on to star in &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;), Marg Downey, Michael Veitch, Peter Moon, Alan Pentland, Steve Blackburn, Geoff Brooks, Ernie Dingo, the &quot;Rubbery Figures&quot; satirical puppets, and numerous guests and supporting stars, such as Gerry Connolly and Bryan Dawe.

&quot;Fast Forward&quot; was succeeded by the related series &quot;Full Frontal&quot;, and subsequently &quot;Totally Full Frontal&quot;, which were broadcast from 1993 to 1999. &quot;Full Frontal&quot; had a different main cast, but many of the &quot;Fast Forward&quot; cast guest-starred.

&quot;Fast Forward&quot; was directed by Ted Emery. From its second series onward, Andrew Knight joined Steve Vizard and Ted Emery as executive producers of the show. They went on to establish the leading Australian production house, Artist Services.

All four seasons plus five &quot;best of&quot; compilations of &quot;Fast Forward&quot; have been released on DVD. All four seasons were re-released in 2010.

In 2013, the Network Ten-owned channel, One, began airing half-hour-long specials titled &quot;Fast Forward Funniest Send-Ups&quot;, which first aired in 1994, making it the first time the show has been shown since 1998.

==Background==
Many of the stars came from a 1985 Seven Network sketch-comedy pilot called &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, which also spawned &quot;The Comedy Company&quot;, via &quot;The D-Generation&quot;. &quot;Fast Forward&quot; was commissioned by Seven in late 1988. It was produced by Vizard&#x27;s production company, United Film Completion, and broadcast on Seven Network. The several working titles for the show include &quot;Snapped Cable Television&quot;, as well as &quot;Fast Forward&quot;.

==Style==
&quot;Fast Forward&quot; was noted for its fast-paced, satirical comedy, which particularly lampooned the media, in particular film and TV, with its parodies of well-known television shows (such as &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Lost In Space&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, and &quot;A Current Affair&quot;), personalities (such as Clive James, Jana Wendt, Derryn Hinch, and Geoffrey Robertson), and commercials (such as for American Express and Nescafé).

Its subjects were also Australian politics, which it attacked through various political impersonations (including John Howard and Paul Keating), and also using the political puppets, Rubbery Figures, previously seen in small segments on the ABC, based on Peter Nicholson&#x27;s political cartoons.

Another key distinguishing feature was the use of simulated channel surfing to switch from sketch to sketch, often in the middle of a sketch, sometimes after the punchline. Particularly, a sketch would abruptly switch to a momentary segment of static, followed by another sketch, simulating the effect of the viewer repeatedly switching channels. The channel-surfing device became a distinctive hallmark of the show that helped move quickly from sketch to sketch.

The television and multimedia subject matter of the sketches, pace, style, and devices were real points of difference from predecessor sketch-comedy shows of the time, particularly earlier shows such as &quot;The Mavis Bramston Show&quot;, &quot;The Naked Vicar Show&quot;, &quot;Australia You&#x27;re Standing In It&quot;, &quot;The D-Generation&quot;, and &quot;The Comedy Company&quot;, &quot;Fast Forward&quot; was more media-focused and parody-focused; a real difference, and the binding force for the whole show, was the now-famous channel-changing device. The white noise and on-screen static that represented the channel change became the modern television equivalent of a curtain being drawn at an old-fashioned vaudeville show.

&quot;Fast Forward&quot; was also well known for its musical parodies, particularly of current music-video clips. Some of the better-known music parodies included ABBA, Cher, and Dannii Minogue.

==Sketches and content==
Each episode of &quot;Fast Forward&quot; featured regular characters, a news-based segment, a major parody of a well-known television show or film, lampoons of television commercials, and political satire, particularly in a segment using the Rubbery Figures political puppets.

Some of the most memorable regular characters included:

* Magda Szubanski: Pixie-Ann Wheatley; Chenille the Beautician (with Marg Downey as Janelle); the Ugly Couple (with Peter Moon)
* Steve Vizard and Peter Moon: Advertising executives, Brent Smythe and Barry; Indian Rug Fakari salesmen Roger Ramshet and Abdul
* Michael Veitch: gay flight attendants (with Steve Vizard); Kelvin Cunnington; Redmond Herring
* Gerry Connolly: the Queen; Joh Bjelke-Petersen
* Jane Turner: Russian news presenter Sveter (with Peter Moon as Victor), an early incarnation of Kath Day-Knight.
* Steve Vizard: Darren Hunch (parody of Derryn Hinch)
* Ernie Dingo: Robert Gottliebsen
* Steve Blackburn and Geoff Brooks: Arthur and Wayne Dodgy (dodgy salesmen who previously appeared in Australia You&#x27;re Standing In It)
* Michael Veitch and Glenn Robbins: The Whizz Bang Theatre Company

Some of the most memorable sketches included &quot;Dumb Street&quot;, a parody of &quot;Home and Away&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot;, and a lampoon of &quot;Skippy&quot;. In one memorable sketch that went to air, Moon and Vizard were both visibly trying to contain their laughter through a series of insults in one of their parodies of &quot;Kung Fu&quot;.

The political puppets Rubbery Figures were made more &quot;commercial&quot; than on the ABC by inserting them into popular situations outside the political Canberra environment. This led to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; parody where Paul Keating was Mr. Spock and Bob Hawke was Captain Kirk. Rubbery Figures was a huge hit and a crucial element in the early success of &quot;Fast Forward&quot;.

In 1991, five Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends skits featured Ertl Thomas models. These segments involved people complaining about Sodor not having female steam engines, the Fat Controller polluting the countryside by pouring purple slime out of the tankers, drunken punks, the engines going on strike, and the engines getting replaced. In these skits, Thomas would do some human things, such as eating breakfast, writing, and going away for the weekend.
Percy was referred to as Bertie two times in the first sketch, Gordon at the end of the fourth, and Henry one time in the fifth. The sketches had five original engine characters, Crazy Bartholomew the Loco Locomotive, who was a Thomas model painted yellow, Alfred, who was a Percy model painted red (he was even referred to as Percy at the start of the fifth sketch), Damian the Diesel, who is not seen in person, Edgar, who is a mentioned engine character, and one of the female engines, who was a Percy model painted orange with additional detailing. Toby was also mentioned once at the end of the first sketch, as was Clarabel once in the fourth sketch.

==Reception==
&quot;Fast Forward&quot; consistently won the ratings for all of its 90 episodes, generally rating in the mid- to high 30s.

The production team and cast decided in late 1992, despite offers to renew from Channel 7, to end the program &#x27;on a high&#x27;, feeling that they did not want it to go downhill and tarnish its legacy as one of Australia&#x27;s best-ever sketch comedy shows.

<doc id="177043" wikidata="Q1141815" url="?curid=177043" title="The Call of Cthulhu">
<text>&quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; is a short story by American writer H. P. Lovecraft. Written in the summer of 1926, it was first published in the pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in February 1928.

==Inspiration==
The first seed of the story&#x27;s first chapter &quot;The Horror in Clay&quot; came from one of Lovecraft&#x27;s own dreams he had in 1919, which he described briefly in two different letters sent to his friend Rheinhart Kleiner on May 21 and December 14, 1920. In the dream, Lovecraft is visiting an antiquity museum in Providence, attempting to convince the aged curator there to buy an odd bas-relief Lovecraft himself had sculpted. The curator initially scoffs at him for trying to sell something that was recently made to a museum of antique objects. Lovecraft then remembers himself answering the curator:

This can be compared to what the character of Henry Anthony Wilcox tells the main character&#x27;s uncle while showing him his sculpted bas-relief for help in reading hieroglyphs on it which came through Wilcox&#x27;s own fantastical dreams:

Lovecraft then used this for a brief synopsis of a new story outlined in his own &quot;Commonplace Book&quot; at first in August 1925, which developed organically out of the idea of what the bas-relief in the dream actually might have depicted. In a footnote for his writing down of his own dream, Lovecraft then finished with the suggestion &quot;Add good development &amp; describe nature of bas-relief&quot; to himself for future reference.

Cthulhu Mythos scholar Robert M. Price claims the irregular sonnet &quot;The Kraken&quot;, published in 1830 by Alfred Tennyson, was a major inspiration, since both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity at the bottom of the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age.

S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz cited other literary inspirations: Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s &quot;The Horla&quot; (1887), which Lovecraft described in &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; as concerning &quot;an invisible being who...sways the minds of others, and seems to be the vanguard of a horde of extraterrestrial organisms arrived on Earth to subjugate and overwhelm mankind&quot;; and Arthur Machen&#x27;s &quot;The Novel of the Black Seal&quot; (1895), which uses the same method of piecing together of disassociated knowledge (including a random newspaper clipping) to reveal the survival of a horrific ancient being.

It is also assumed he got inspiration from William Scott-Elliot&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Atlantis&quot; (1896) and &quot;The Lost Lemuria&quot; (1904), which Lovecraft read in 1926 shortly before he started to work on the story.

Price also notes that Lovecraft admired the work of Lord Dunsany, who wrote &quot;The Gods of Pegana&quot; (1905), which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening. Another Dunsany work cited by Price is &quot;A Shop in Go-by Street&quot; (1919), which stated &quot;the heaven of the gods who sleep&quot;, and &quot;unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber&quot;.

The &quot;slight earthquake&quot; mentioned in the story is likely the 1925 Charlevoix–Kamouraska earthquake.

S.T. Joshi has also cited A. Merritt&#x27;s novella &quot;The Moon Pool&quot; (1918) which Lovecraft &#x27;frequently rhapsodied about&#x27;. Joshi says that &#x27;Merritt&#x27;s mention of a &quot;moon-door&quot; that, when tilted, leads the characters into a lower region of wonder and horror seems similar to the huge door whose inadvertent opening by the sailors causes Cthulhu to emerge from R&#x27;lyeh&#x27;.

Edward Guimont has argued that H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; was an influence on &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, citing the thematic similarities of ancient, powerful, but indifferent aliens associated with deities; physical similarities between Cthulhu and the Martians; and the plot detail of a ship ramming an alien in a temporarily successful but ultimately futile gesture.

==Plot==
The deceased narrator, Francis Wayland Thurston, recounts his discovery of notes left behind by his grand-uncle, Brown University linguistic professor George Gammell Angell, after his death in the winter of 1926–27. Among the notes is a small bas-relief sculpture of a scaly creature which yields &quot;simultaneous pictures of an octopus, a dragon, and a human caricature.&quot; The sculptor, a Rhode Island art student named Henry Anthony Wilcox, based the work on delirious dreams of &quot;great Cyclopean cities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths.&quot; Frequent references to Cthulhu and R&#x27;lyeh are found in Wilcox&#x27;s papers. Angell also discovers reports of mass hysteria around the world.

More notes discuss a 1908 meeting of an archeological society in which New Orleans police official John Raymond Legrasse asks attendees to identify a statuette of unidentifiable greenish-black stone resembling Wilcox&#x27;s sculpture. It is then revealed that the previous year, Legrasse and a party of policemen found several women and children being used in a ritual by an all-male cult. After killing five of the cultists and arresting 47 others, Legrasse learns that they worship the &quot;Great Old Ones&quot; and await the return of a monstrous being called Cthulhu. The prisoners identify the statuette as &quot;great Cthulhu.&quot; One of the academics present at the meeting, Princeton professor William Channing Webb, describes a group of &quot;Esquimaux&quot; with similar beliefs and fetishes.

Thurston discovers a 1925 article from an Australian newspaper which reports the discovery of a derelict ship, the &quot;Alert&quot;, of which second mate Gustaf Johansen is the sole survivor. Johansen reports that the &quot;Emma&quot; was attacked by a heavily armed yacht named the &quot;Alert&quot;. The crewmen of the &quot;Emma&quot; killed those aboard the &quot;Alert&quot;, but lost their own ship in the battle, commandeered the &quot;Alert&quot;, and discovered an uncharted island in the vicinity of co-ordinates of . With the exception of Johansen and another man, the remaining crew died on the island. Johansen does not reveal the manner of their death.

Upon traveling to Australia, Thurston views a statue retrieved from the &quot;Alert&quot; which is identical to the previous two. In Norway, he learns that Johansen died suddenly after an encounter with &quot;two Lascar sailors&quot;. Johansen&#x27;s widow provides Thurston with her late husband&#x27;s manuscript, wherein the uncharted island is described as being home to a &quot;nightmare corpse-city&quot; called R&#x27;lyeh. Johansen&#x27;s crew struggled to comprehend the non-Euclidean geometry of the city and accidentally released Cthulhu, resulting in their deaths. Johansen and one crewmate fled aboard the &quot;Alert&quot; and were pursued by Cthulhu. Johansen rammed the yacht into the creature&#x27;s head, only for its injury to regenerate. The &quot;Alert&quot; escaped, but Johansen&#x27;s crewmate died. After finishing the manuscript, Thurston realizes he is now a target of Cthulhu&#x27;s worshippers, and hopes in vain that it will be destroyed following his death.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Lovecraft regarded the short story as &quot;rather middling—not as bad as the worst, but full of cheap and cumbrous touches&quot;. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; editor Farnsworth Wright first rejected the story, and only accepted it after writer Donald Wandrei, a friend of Lovecraft&#x27;s, falsely claimed that Lovecraft was thinking of submitting it elsewhere.

The published story was regarded by Robert E. Howard (creator of Conan the Barbarian) as &quot;a masterpiece, which I am sure will live as one of the highest achievements of literature... Mr. Lovecraft holds a unique position in the literary world; he has grasped, to all intents, the worlds outside our paltry ken&quot;. Lovecraft scholar Peter Cannon regarded the story as &quot;ambitious and complex...a dense and subtle narrative in which the horror gradually builds to cosmic proportions&quot;, adding &quot;one of [Lovecraft&#x27;s] bleakest fictional expressions of man&#x27;s insignificant place in the universe&quot;.

French novelist Michel Houellebecq, in his book &quot;H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life&quot;, described the story as the first of Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;great texts&quot;.

Canadian mathematician Benjamin K. Tippett noted that the phenomena described in Johansen&#x27;s journal may be interpreted as &quot;observable consequences of a localized bubble of spacetime curvature&quot;, and proposed a suitable mathematical model.

E. F. Bleiler has referred to &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; as &quot;a fragmented essay with narrative inclusions&quot;.

<text>The Kennett Bros is the business name for brothers Paul Kennett, Simon Kennett and Jonathan Kennett. They have been heavily involved in mountain biking in New Zealand since 1984, and in publishing books about cycling and cyclists. They were inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Activities==
Paul organised the first national mountain bike race in New Zealand in 1986 – the Karapoti Classic. The Kennett Bros continued to run this annually until 2002, when they sold the event.

In 1997 they co-organised a round of the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in Wellington.

In 1998 they started building the Wellington City Council owned Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park, which received a national recreation award in 2002 and a national conservation award in 2003.

From 2001 to 2006 the Kennett Bros coordinated a forest revegetation project at Ōtari-Wilton&#x27;s Bush, in which 40,000 trees were planted over a five-year period.

The Kennett Bros helped organise the 2006 Rotorua UCI Mountain Bike &amp; Trials World Championships.

From 2010 to 2014 the Kennett Bros were a project manager on the New Zealand Cycle Trail.

==Publishing==
Paul ran a national mountain bike magazine called &quot;Mountain Bike New Zealand Magazine&quot; from 1988 to 1990.

In 1991 the Kennett Bros wrote the first edition of &quot;Classic New Zealand Mountain Bike Rides&quot;, a national guidebook, which became a best seller. They produce new editions every three years (1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2017, 2019). In 2019 they announced that the tenth (2019) edition would be the last in the series.

In 1995 Paul launched the Mountain Bike New Zealand Web, the online home for many New Zealand mountain bikers.

In 2004 they published a history of cycling in New Zealand called &quot;RIDE: The Story of Cycling in New Zealand&quot;.

From 2005 to 2019 they published a series of seven books on influential New Zealand cyclists called the New Zealand Cycling Legend Series.

==Recognition==
In 2018, the Kennett Brothers were inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame.

<text>The Karapoti Classic is New Zealand&#x27;s longest-running annual mountain bike event, started in 1986 by Paul Kennett. The full course is long and starts in Karapoti Park, Akatarawa, in Upper Hutt, and heads up the Karapoti Gorge. From there it begins a single loop in the native and pine forest of the Akatarawa Ranges.

The 1986 Karapoti was New Zealand&#x27;s first national mountain bike race and was self declared the National Off-Road Championships. The event was managed by the Kennett Bros until 2002.

The event differs from most races because it comprises a large single loop and the route does not change from year to year.

With two exceptions, it has since 1993 been held on the first Saturday of March every year.
