<doc id="183215" wikidata="Q275610" url="?curid=183215" title="Agnes Martin">
<text>Agnes Bernice Martin (March 22, 1912 – December 16, 2004) was an American abstract painter known for her minimalist style and abstract expressionism. Born in Canada, she moved to the United States in 1931, where she pursued higher education and became a U.S. citizen in 1950. Martin&#x27;s artistic journey began in New York City, where she immersed herself in modern art and developed a deep interest in abstraction. Despite often being labeled a minimalist, she identified more with abstract expressionism. Her work has been defined as an &quot;essay in discretion, inwardness and silence.&quot;

Growing up in rural Canada and influenced by the New Mexico desert, where she lived for the last several decades of her life, Martin&#x27;s art was characterized by serene compositions featuring grids and lines. Her works were predominantly monochromatic, employing subtle colors like black, white, and brown. Martin&#x27;s minimalist approach conveyed tranquility and spirituality, and her paintings often carried positive names reflective of her philosophy.

Her career included numerous exhibitions, totaling over 85 solo shows, and participation in major events such as the Venice Biennale and Documenta. Martin&#x27;s work earned recognition for its unique contribution to contemporary art, and she received awards like the National Medal of Arts from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998. She was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2004.

Despite personal struggles with schizophrenia, Martin&#x27;s dedication to her art persisted, and her legacy continues to inspire contemporary artists. Documentaries and films have explored her life and work, shedding light on her artistic process and impact. Beyond the art world, her influence extends to popular culture, as seen in a Google doodle and a song dedicated to her. Martin&#x27;s artistic vision, blending minimalism and spirituality, remains an enduring and influential force in the realm of abstract art.

==Early life==
Agnes Bernice Martin was born in 1912 to Scottish Presbyterian farmers in Macklin, Saskatchewan, one of four children. From 1919, she grew up in Vancouver. She moved to the United States in 1931 to help her pregnant sister, Maribel, in Bellingham, Washington.:29 She preferred American higher education and became an American citizen in 1950. Martin studied at Western Washington University College of Education, Bellingham, Washington, prior to receiving her B.A. (1942) from Teachers College, Columbia University. It was while living in New York that Martin became interested in modern art and was exposed to artists such as Arshile Gorky (1904–1948), Adolph Gottlieb (1903–1974), and Joan Miró (1893–1983). She took a multitude of studio classes at Teachers College and began to seriously consider a career as an artist.

In 1947, she attended the Summer Field School of the University of New Mexico in Taos, New Mexico. After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar D. T. Suzuki at Columbia, she became interested in Asian thought, not as a religious discipline, but as a code of ethics, a practical how-to for getting through life. A few years following graduation, Martin matriculated at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, where she also taught art courses before returning to Columbia University to earn her M.A. (1952) in modern art. She moved to New York City in 1957 and lived in a loft in Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan. The Coenties Slip was also home to several other artists and their studios. There was a strong sense of community although each had their own practices and artistic temperaments. The Coenties Slip was also a haven for the queer community in the 1960s. It is speculated that Martin was romantically involved with the artist Lenore Tawney (1907–2007) during this time. A pioneer of her time, Martin never publicly expressed her sexuality, but has been described as a &quot;closeted homosexual.&quot; The 2018 biography &quot;Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon&quot; describes several romantic relationships between Martin and other women, including the dealer Betty Parsons. She often employed a feminist lens when she critiqued fellow artists&#x27; work. Jaleh Mansoor, an art historian, stated that Martin was &quot;too engaged in a feminist relation to practice, perhaps, to objectify and label it as such.&quot; It is worth noting that Martin herself did not identify as a feminist and even once told a &quot;New Yorker&quot; journalist in an interview that she thought &quot;the women&#x27;s movement had failed.&quot;

Martin was publicly known to have schizophrenia, although it was undocumented until 1962. She even once opted for electric shock therapy for treatment at Bellevue Hospital in New York. Martin did have the support of her friends from the Coenties Slip, who came together after one of her episodes to enlist the help of a respected psychiatrist, who as an art collector was a friend to the community. However, her struggle was a largely private and individual one, and the full effect of the mental illness on her life is unknown.

Martin left New York City abruptly in 1967, disappearing from the art world to live alone. After eighteen months on the road camping across both Canada and the western United States, Martin settled in Mesa Portales, near Cuba, New Mexico (1968-1977). She rented a 50-acre property and lived a simple life in an adobe home that she built for herself, adding four other buildings over the years. During these years she did not paint, until 1971, when she was approached by curator Douglas Crimp who was interested in organizing her first solo non-commercial exhibition. Subsequently, Martin started to write and lecture at various universities about her work. Slowly Martin&#x27;s interest in painting renewed as well. She approached Pace Gallery about her work and the gallery&#x27;s founder Arne Glimcher (b.1938) became her lifelong dealer. Finally able to own her own property, she moved to Galisteo, New Mexico, where she lived until 1993. She built an adobe home there too, still choosing an austere lifestyle. Although she still preferred solitude and lived alone, Martin was more active in the art world, travelling extensively and showing in Canada, the United States, and internationally. In 1993 she moved to a retirement residence in Taos, New Mexico, where she lived until her death in 2004.

Many of her paintings bear positive names such as &quot;Happy Holiday&quot; (1999) and &quot;I Love the Whole World&quot; (2000). In an interview in 1989, discussing her life and her painting, Martin said, &quot;Beauty and perfection are the same. They never occur without happiness.&quot;

==Career==
Her work is most closely associated with Taos, with some of her early work visibly inspired by the desert environment of New Mexico. However, there is also a strong influence from her young upbringing in rural Canada, particularly the vast and quiet Saskatchewan prairies. While she described herself as an American painter, she never forgot her Canadian roots, returning there after she left New York in 1967, as well as during her extensive travels in the 1970s. Some of Martin&#x27;s early works have been described as simplified farmer&#x27;s fields, and Martin herself left her work open to interpretation encouraging comparisons of her unembellished, monochromatic canvases to landscapes.

She moved to New York City at the invitation of the artist/gallery owner Betty Parsons in 1957 (the women had met prior to 1954). That year, she settled in Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan, where her friends and neighbors, several of whom were also affiliated with Parsons, included Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman, and Lenore Tawney. Barnett Newman actively promoted Martin&#x27;s work, and helped install Martin&#x27;s exhibitions at Betty Parsons Gallery beginning in the late 1950s. Another close friend and mentor was Ad Reinhardt. In 1961 Martin contributed a brief introduction to a brochure for her friend Lenore Tawney&#x27;s first solo exhibition, the only occasion on which she wrote on the work of a fellow artist. In 1967, Martin famously abandoned her life in New York. Cited reasons include the death of her friend Ad Reinhardt, the demolition of many buildings on Coenties Slip, and a breakup with the artist Chryssa whom Martin had dated off and on throughout the 1960s. In her ten years living in New York Martin was frequently hospitalized to control symptoms of schizophrenia which manifested in the artist in a number of ways, including aural hallucinations and states of catatonia: on a number of occasions she received electroconvulsive therapy at Manhattan&#x27;s Bellevue Hospital. After Martin left New York, she drove around the western US and Canada, settling in Cuba, New Mexico for a few years (1968-1977), then settling in Galisteo, New Mexico (1977-1993). In both New Mexico homes, she built adobe brick structures herself. She did not return to art until 1973 and consciously distanced herself from the social life and social events that brought other artists into the public eye. She collaborated with architect Bill Katz in 1974 on a log cabin she would use as her studio. That same year, she completed a group of new paintings and from 1975 they were exhibited regularly.

In 1976 she made her first film, &quot;Gabriel&quot;, a 78-minute landscape film which features a little boy going for a walk. A second movie, &quot;Captivity&quot;, was never completed after the artist threw the rough cut into the town dump.

According to a filmed interview with her that was released in 2003, she had moved from New York City only when she was told her rented loft/workspace/studio would be no longer available because of the building&#x27;s imminent demolition. She went on further to state that she could not conceive of working in any other space in New York. When she died at age 92, she was said not to have read a newspaper for the last 50 years. Essays in the book dedicated to the exhibition of her work in New York at The Drawing Center (traveling to other museums as well) in 2005 – &quot;3x abstraction&quot; – analyzed the spiritual dimension in Martin&#x27;s work. The 2018 biography &quot;Agnes Martin: Pioneer, Painter, Icon&quot; was the first book to explore her relationship with women and her early life in substantial detail, and was written in collaboration with Martin&#x27;s family and friends.

==Artistic style==
In addition to a couple of self-portraits and a few watercolor landscapes, Martin&#x27;s early works included biomorphic paintings in subdued colors made when the artist had a grant to work in Taos between 1955 and 1957. However, she did her best to seek out and destroy paintings from the years when she was taking her first steps into abstraction.

Martin praised Mark Rothko for having &quot;reached zero so that nothing could stand in the way of truth&quot;. Following his example Martin also pared down to the most reductive elements to encourage a perception of perfection and to emphasize transcendent reality. Her signature style was defined by an emphasis upon line, grids, and fields of extremely subtle color. Particularly in her breakthrough years of the early 1960s, she created 6 × 6 foot square canvases that were covered in dense, minute and softly delineated graphite grids. In the 1966 exhibition &quot;Systemic Painting&quot; at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Martin&#x27;s grids were therefore celebrated as examples of Minimalist art and were hung among works by artists including Sol LeWitt, Robert Ryman, and Donald Judd. While minimalist in form, however, these paintings were quite different in spirit from those of her other minimalist counterparts, retaining small flaws and unmistakable traces of the artist&#x27;s hand; she shied away from intellectualism, favoring the personal and spiritual. Her paintings, statements, and influential writings often reflected an interest in Eastern philosophy, especially Taoist. Because of her work&#x27;s added spiritual dimension, which became more and more dominant after 1967, she preferred to be classified as an abstract expressionist.

Martin worked in only black, white, and brown before moving to New Mexico. The last painting before she abandoned her career, and left New York in 1967, &quot;Trumpet&quot;, marked a departure in that the single rectangle evolved into an overall grid of rectangles. In this painting the rectangles were drawn in pencil over uneven washes of gray translucent paint. In 1973, she returned to art making, and produced a portfolio of 30 serigraphs, &quot;On a Clear Day&quot;. During her time in Taos, she introduced light pastel washes to her grids, colors that shimmered in the changing light. Later, Martin reduced the scale of her signature 72 × 72 square paintings to 60 × 60 inches, and shifted her work to use bands of ethereal color. Another departure was a modification, if not a refinement, of the grid structure, which Martin has used since the late 1950s. In &quot;Untitled No. 4&quot; (1994), for example, one viewed the gentle striations of pencil line and primary color washes of diluted acrylic paint blended with gesso. The lines, which encompassed this painting, were not measured by a ruler, but rather intuitively marked by the artist. In the 1990s, symmetry would often give way to varying widths of horizontal bands.

Lawrence Alloway noted that Martin is in the first generation of the Abstract Expressionism style, which is significant and &quot;shows her commitment to exalted subject matter&quot; and her ability to &quot;transform it into the language of painting which gives the works their aura of silent dignity.&quot;

==Exhibitions==

Since her first solo exhibition in 1958, Martin&#x27;s work has been the subject of more than 85 solo shows and two retrospectives including the survey, &quot;Agnes Martin&quot;, organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, which later traveled to Jamaica (1992–94) and &quot;Agnes Martin: Paintings and Drawings 1974–1990&quot; organized by the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, with subsequent venues in France and Germany (1991–92). In 1998, the Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico mounted Agnes Martin Works on Paper. In 2002, the Menil Collection, Houston, mounted &quot;Agnes Martin: The Nineties and Beyond&quot;. That same year, the Harwood Museum of Art at the University of New Mexico, Pandora, organized &quot;Agnes Martin: Paintings from 2001&quot;, as well as a symposium honoring Martin on the occasion of her 90th birthday.

In addition to participating in an international array of group exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale (1997, 1980, 1976), the Whitney Biennial (1995, 1977), and Documenta, Kassel, Germany (1972), Martin has been the recipient of multiple honors including the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of the Women&#x27;s Caucus for Art of the College Art Association (2005); Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1992); the Governor&#x27;s Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts given by Governor Gary Johnson, Santa Fe, New Mexico (1998); the National Medal of Arts awarded by President Bill Clinton and the National Endowment for the Arts (1998); the Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement by the College Art Association (1998); the Golden Lion for Contribution to Contemporary Art at the Venice Biennale (1997); the Oskar Kokoschka Prize awarded by the Austrian government (1992); the Alexej von Jawlensky Prize awarded by the city of Wiesbaden, Germany (1991); and election to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, New York (1989).

Exhibitions continue to be mounted since her death in 2004, including &quot;Agnes Martin: Closing the Circle, Early and Late&quot; from February 10, 2006 to March 04, 2006 at Pace Gallery. Other exhibitions have been held in New York, Zurich, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Cambridge (England), Aspen, Albuquerque, British Columbia in Canada. In 2012, The Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, New Mexico, University of New Mexico launched a museum-wide exhibition titled &quot;Agnes Martin Before the Grid&quot; in honor of her centennial year. This exhibit was the first to focus on the work and life of Martin prior to 1960. The exhibit focused on many, never seen before, works Martin created at Columbia, Coentis Slip and early years in New Mexico. It was also the first to consider Martins struggle with mental health, sexuality and Martin&#x27;s important relationship with Ad Reinhardt. In 2015, Tate Modern ran a retrospective of her life and career from the 1950s until her last work in 2004, which will travel to other museums after the show in London. At the University of Michigan Museum of Art, Martin was featured in the exhibition &quot;Reductive Minimalism: Women Artists in Dialogue, 1960-2014&quot; which examined the two generations of Minimalist art side by side, from October 2014 through January 2015. The exhibition included Anne Truitt, Mary Corse, and contemporary artists Shirazeh Houshiary and Tomma Abts.

She was also featured in &quot;White on the White: Color, Scene, and Space&quot; in Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art. From October 2015 through April 2016, Martin was exhibited in &quot;Opening the Box: Unpacking Minimalism&quot; at The George Economou Collection in Athens, Greece alongside Dan Flavin and Donald Judd. From 2015 to 2017 she had numerous solo exhibitions, some being at the Aspen Art Museum in Aspen Colorado, Tate Modern in London, K20, Kunstsammlung Nordhein-Westfalen in Düsseldorf, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in Los Angeles, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in the Upper East Side, at the Palace of Governors, The New Mexico Museum of History in Santa Fe. She has featured in the ongoing exhibition Intuitive Progression at the Fisher Landau Center for Art in Long Island City, New York from February 2017 to August 2017.

In 2016, a retrospective exhibition of her works from the 1950s through 2004 was presented at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 2016 she was also featured in the &quot;Dansaekhwa and Minimalism Exhibition&quot; at Blum &amp; Poe, Los Angeles and earlier in the year in the show titled &quot;Aspects of Minimalism: Selections from East End Collections&quot; at the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, New York.

She was also featured in &quot;Making Space: Women Artists and Postwar Abstraction&quot; at The Museum of Modern Art in Midtown, New York which shined a light on women artists who worked post World War II and before the start of the Feminist movement. The exhibition went from April 2017 to August 2017 and featured Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler, and Joan Mitchell, Lygia Clark, Gego, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Louise Bourgeois, and Eva Hesse.

Martin&#x27;s work was included in the 2021 exhibition &quot;Women in Abstraction&quot; at the Centre Pompidou.

In 2015, &quot;Untitled #7&quot; (1984), a white acrylic painting with geometric pencil lines, sold for $4.2 million at Phillips in New York. In 2016, her &quot;Orange Grove&quot; sold at auction for $13.7 million, the same year as the Guggenheim held a retrospective of her work.

==Legacy==
Martin became an inspiration to younger artists, from Eva Hesse to Ellen Gallagher.

Her image is included in the iconic 1972 poster Some Living American Women Artists by Mary Beth Edelson.

In 1994, the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos, part of the University of New Mexico, announced that it would renovate its Pueblo-revival building and dedicate one wing to Martin&#x27;s work. The gallery was designed according to the artist&#x27;s wishes in order to accommodate Martin&#x27;s gift of seven large untitled paintings made between 1993 and 1994. An Albuquerque architectural firm, Kells &amp; Craig, designed the octagonal gallery with an oculus installed overhead, and four yellow Donald Judd benches placed directly under the oculus. The gift of the paintings and gallery&#x27;s design and construction were negotiated and overseen by Robert M. Ellis, the Harwood&#x27;s director at the time and a close friend of Martin&#x27;s. Today, the Agnes Martin Gallery attracts visitors from all over the world and has been compared by scholars to the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence (Matisse Chapel), Corbusier&#x27;s Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut in Ronchamp, and the Rothko Chapel in Houston.

===In popular culture===
Composer John Zorn&#x27;s &quot;Redbird&quot; (1995) was inspired by and dedicated to Martin.

Wendy Beckett, in her book &quot;American Masterpieces,&quot; said about Martin: &quot;Agnes Martin often speaks of joy; she sees it as the desired condition of all life. Who would disagree with her?... No-one who has seriously spent time before an Agnes Martin, letting its peace communicate itself, receiving its inexplicable and ineffable happiness, has ever been disappointed. The work awes, not just with its delicacy, but with its vigor, and this power and visual interest is something that has to be experienced.&quot;

Poet Hugh Behm-Steinberg&#x27;s poem &quot;Gridding, after some sentences by Agnes Martin&quot; discusses patterns in the natural world, makes a parallel between writing and painting, and ends with a line about the poet&#x27;s admiration of Martin&#x27;s work.

Her work inspired a Google doodle on the 102nd anniversary of her birth on March 22, 2014. The doodle takes color cues from Martin&#x27;s late work which is marked by soft edges, muted colors and distinctly horizontal bands, turned to six vertical bars, one for each letter of the Google logo.

The song &quot;Agnes Martin&quot; by American rock band Screaming Females, from their album &quot;All at Once&quot;, is an ode to the artist.

Poet Victoria Chang&#x27;s work &quot;With My Back to the World&quot; (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2024) is in conversation with both Martin&#x27;s artwork and writings.

<text>Shangdu (; ; ; , ), popularly known in English as Xanadu ( ), was the summer capital of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty before Kublai moved his throne to the former Jin dynasty capital of Zhōngdū () which was renamed Khanbaliq (present-day Beijing). Shangdu is located in the present-day Zhenglan Banner, Inner Mongolia. In June 2012, under its English name Xanadu, it was made a World Heritage Site for its historical importance and for the unique blending of Mongolian and Chinese culture. 

Venetian traveller Marco Polo described Shangdu to Europeans after visiting it in 1275. It was conquered in 1369 by the Ming army under Chang Yuchun. Historical accounts of the city inspired the poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;, written by English Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1797, who called it “Xanadu”.

== History ==

Shangdu was located in what is now Shangdu Town, Zhenglan Banner, Inner Mongolia, north of Beijing. It is about northwest of the modern town of Duolun. The layout of the capital is roughly square shaped with sides of about . It consists of an &quot;outer city&quot;, and an &quot;inner city&quot; in the southeast of the capital which has also roughly a square layout with sides about , and the palace, where Kublai Khan stayed in summer. The palace has sides of roughly , covering an area of around 40% the size of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The most visible modern-day remnants are the earthen walls though there is also a ground-level, circular brick platform in the centre of the inner enclosure.

The city, originally named &quot;Kaiping&quot; (), was designed by Chinese architect Liu Bingzhong from 1252 to 1256, and Liu implemented a &quot;profoundly Chinese scheme for the city&#x27;s architecture&quot;. In 1264 it was renamed Shangdu by Kublai Khan. At its zenith, over 100,000 people lived within its walls. In 1369 Shangdu was occupied by the Ming army, put to the torch and its name reverted to Kaiping. The last reigning Khan Toghun Temür fled the city, which was abandoned for several hundred years.

In 1872, Steven Bushell, affiliated with the British Legation in Beijing, visited the site and reported that remains of temples, blocks of marble, and tiles were still to be found there. By the 1990s, all these artifacts were completely gone, most likely collected by the inhabitants of the nearby town of Dolon Nor to construct their houses. The artwork is still seen in the walls of some Dolon Nor buildings.

Today, only ruins remain, surrounded by a grassy mound that was once the city walls. Since 2002, a restoration effort has been undertaken.

==Astronomy==

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) gave a continent-sized area of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan the name Xanadu, referring to Coleridge&#x27;s poem. Xanadu raised considerable interest in scientists after its radar image showed its terrain to be quite similar to earth&#x27;s terrain with flowing rivers (probably of methane and ethane, not of water as they are on Earth), mountains (of ice, not conventional rock) and sand dunes.

== Literary descriptions ==

=== Marco Polo ===

The Venetian explorer Marco Polo is widely believed to have visited Shangdu in about 1275. In about 1298–99, he dictated the following account:

=== Toghon Temur ===

The lament of Toghon Temur Khan (the &quot;Ukhaant Khan&quot; or &quot;Sage Khan&quot;), concerning the loss of Daidu (Beijing) and Heibun Shanduu (Kaiping Xanadu) in 1368, is recorded in many Mongolian historical chronicles. The &quot;Altan Tobchi&quot; version is translated as follows:

=== Samuel Purchas ===

In 1614, the English clergyman Samuel Purchas published &quot;Purchas his Pilgrimes – or Relations of the world and the Religions observed in all ages and places discovered, from the Creation unto this Present&quot;. This book contained a brief description of Shangdu, which he called Xandu, based on the early description of Marco Polo:

In 1625 Purchas published an expanded edition of this book, recounting the voyages of famous travellers, again called &quot;Purchas his Pilgrimes&quot;. The eleventh volume of this book included a more detailed description of Shangdu, attributed to Marco Polo and dated 1320:

=== Samuel Taylor Coleridge ===

In 1797, according to his own account, the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge was reading about Shangdu in &quot;Purchas his Pilgrimes&quot;, fell asleep, and had an opium-inspired dream. The dream caused him to begin the poem known as &#x27;Kubla Khan&#x27;. Unfortunately Coleridge&#x27;s writing was interrupted by an unnamed &quot;person on business from Porlock&quot;, causing him to forget much of the dream, but his images of Shangdu became one of the best-known poems in the English language.

Coleridge described how he wrote the poem in the preface to his collection of poems, &quot;Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep&quot;, published in 1816:

Coleridge&#x27;s poem opens similarly to Purchas&#x27;s description before proceeding to a vivid description of the palace&#x27;s varied pleasures:

== In popular culture ==
* Xanadu is the name of Charles Foster Kane&#x27;s stately mansion in the 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.
* &quot;Xanadu&quot; is the name of a track off of the Rush album &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;, that references the poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
* &quot;Xanadu&quot; is the name of a 1980 film starring Olivia Newton-John.

<text>A first minister is any of a variety of leaders of government cabinets. The term literally has the same meaning as &quot;prime minister&quot; but is typically chosen to distinguish the office-holder from a superior prime minister. Currently the title of &quot;first minister&quot; is used to refer to the political leader of a devolved national government, such as the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, or of a dependent territory.

==Canada==

In Canada, a first minister is any of the Canadian first ministers of the Crown, otherwise known as heads of government, including the Prime Minister of Canada and the provincial and territorial premiers. The title is used in such formulae as &quot;first ministers&#x27; meetings&quot;.

In Newfoundland and Labrador, the Inuit self-governing region of Nunatsiavut provides for a first minister responsible to the Nunatsiavut Assembly.

==Norway==
The head of government of Norway was called &quot;first minister&quot; () between 1814 and 1873, while it was in personal union with Sweden. In 1893, 12 years prior to the dissolution of the union, it was changed to prime minister (&quot;statsminister&quot;).

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;first minister&quot; was once used interchangeably with prime minister, such as when Winston Churchill stated: &quot;I did not become His Majesty&#x27;s First Minister so that I might oversee the liquidation of the British Empire!&quot;

Nowadays, the term is used to describe the leaders of the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. See

*List of first ministers
*First Minister of Scotland
*First Minister of Wales
*First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland

==Other==
In Australia, the premiers and chief ministers are the first ministers of the states and territories respectively.

In Germany, the first minister in each federal state is known as the Minister President (&quot;Ministerpräsident&quot;). A similar term exists in countries with some historic German influence, e.g. Latvia, the Netherlands etc.

In Malaysia, the first minister for each state with a Malay ruler is known as the Menteri Besar. Meanwhile, the heads of government in the four states without a monarch are called chief ministers.

George Price held the office of First Minister of British Honduras from 1961 until 1964, when it became self-governing and the title was changed to Premier. He continued as Premier after the colony changed its names to Belize, and then as Prime Minister after Belize gained full independence in 1981.

<text>A submitochondrial particle (SMP) is an artificial vesicle made from the inner mitochondrial membrane. They can be formed by subjecting isolated mitochondria to sonication, freezing and thawing, high pressure, or osmotic shock. SMPs can be used to study the electron transport chain in a cell-free context.

The process of SMP formation forces the inner mitochondrial membrane inside out, meaning that the matrix-facing leaflet becomes the outer surface of the SMP, and the intermembrane space-facing leaflet faces the lumen of the SMP. As a consequence, the F1 particles which normally face the matrix are exposed. Chaotropic agents can destabilize F1 particles and cause them to dissociate from the membrane, thereby uncoupling the final step of oxidative phosphorylation from the rest of the electron transport chain.

<doc id="183230" wikidata="Q843431" url="?curid=183230" title="Virgin Trains">
<text>Virgin Trains (VT) (legal name West Coast Trains Limited) was a train operating company in the United Kingdom owned by Virgin Rail Group, a joint venture between Virgin Group and Stagecoach, which operated the InterCity West Coast franchise from 9 March 1997 to 7 December 2019. The franchise covered long-distance passenger services on the West Coast Main Line between London, the West Midlands, North West England, North Wales and southern Scotland, consequently connecting six of the UK&#x27;s largest cities: London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh, which have a combined metropolitan population of over 18 million. It had around 3,400 employees in 2015.

The Virgin Trains brand was also used on the legally and operationally separate Virgin Trains East Coast from 2015 until 2018, and previously on Virgin CrossCountry, which operated between 1997 and 2007, as well as from 2018 to 2020 by Virgin Trains USA in Florida.

The contract expired on 7 December 2019 (having been originally scheduled for expiry in March 2020) and Virgin did not contest losing the franchise after its joint venture partner, Stagecoach, was disqualified due to an invalid bid in April 2019.

==History==
Amid the privatisation of British Rail during the mid 1990s, the newly-formed Virgin Rail Group submitted multiple bids to operate several different train franchises, including Gatwick Express, InterCity CrossCountry and InterCity West Coast. It was successful in winning the latter two, leading to Virgin CrossCountry and &quot;Virgin West Coast&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;Virgin Trains&quot;) commencing operations in January and March 1997 respectively.

One of Virgin&#x27;s franchise commitments was to replace the British Rail-era locomotives and rolling stock inherited by Virgin West Coast with brand new tilting trains.. It was expected that the Pendolinos would run at service speeds of up to and that the whole fleet would be delivered by May 2002. In order for tilting trains to be operated, Railtrack had committed itself to upgrading the West Coast Main Line as to permit 140 mph operation by 2005. The line&#x27;s modernisation was slowed by spiralling costs, rising from an estimated £2 billion to roughly £10 billion, while the programme had failures that were technical as well as managerial, such as the moving block signalling apparatus being immature for such a busy mixed-traffic mainline. Railtrack would ultimately collapse while its successor, Network Rail, would also be unable to fully deliver the promised upgrade, heavily impacting Virgin West Coast&#x27;s operations. The upgrade programme would be cut back: as a result, the top speed was reduced to 125 mph.

Virgin Trains&#x27; franchise was originally due to expire in March 2012. During mid 2009, Virgin founder Richard Branson launched a campaign to have the next franchise period extended for 20 to 30 years, so that Virgin could spend more on infrastructure and see a return on its investment. Branson said the journey time between London and Birmingham could be reduced by 22 minutes to under one hour. This approach was turned down by the Department for Transport. Virgin proceeded to apply for a two-year extension, but this was also ruled out by the Department of Transport on legal grounds.

In January 2011, the Department for Transport called for expressions of interest in bidding for the next InterCity West Coast franchise. In March 2011, the Department announced that Abellio, FirstGroup, Keolis/SNCF and Virgin Rail Group had been shortlisted to bid for the franchise. In May 2011, the Secretary of State for Transport announced that the end date had been postponed to allow the recommendations in the McNulty Report to be absorbed. In October 2011, the Department announced that Virgin had been granted a franchise extension until December 2012.

An Invitation to tender was issued to the shortlisted bidders in January 2012, and the Department for Transport awarded FirstGroup the new franchise in August 2012. Virgin spoke out against this decision, claiming that the methodology used to award the franchise was flawed, while Richard Branson stated that it was unlikely Virgin would bid for any future franchises. When the DfT did not directly respond to Virgin&#x27;s concerns, the operator launched proceedings for a judicial review.

During October 2012, the Secretary of State announced that the government was cancelling the franchise competition for the InterCity West Coast franchise after discovering significant technical flaws in the way the franchise process was conducted, reversing the decision to award it to FirstGroup. Following an independent review of the franchising process, a fresh competition would be held. The government announced that it would negotiate with Virgin Trains to run the InterCity West Coast franchise for a further 9 to 13 months. In December 2012, Virgin was awarded a 23-month management contract to run the franchise until 9 November 2014.

In March 2013, the Secretary of State announced that the franchise would again be extended until 31 March 2017. During May 2013, there was a controversy regarding new uniforms, with claims that the blouses were too revealing and potentially exposed dark bras to the public. Virgin Rail Group responded to this by offering a voucher worth £20 to allow employees to purchase a top to wear underneath the new blouses.

In July 2013, the Office of Rail Regulation rejected an application by Virgin Trains to operate new services to Shrewsbury and Blackpool North, citing capacity constraints on the West Coast Main Line. In November 2013, a revised application for services to Shrewsbury and Blackpool North was approved, and the services started in December 2014.

During November 2016, the franchise was further extended until March 2019. In February 2018, the contract was yet again extended until March 2019, with an option to extend it further to March 2020. In March 2018, it was announced that the contract would end in September 2019 when the new West Coast Partnership franchise would commence.

In December 2018, it was announced that Virgin Trains had been granted a one-year extension until March 2020. In April 2019, Stagecoach revealed that it had been disqualified from the franchises it was bidding for, including the West Coast Partnership. One month later, the company announced that it would mount a legal challenge to its disqualification. On 17 June 2020, the High Court ruled against the company and that the decision had been lawful.

In August 2019, it was announced that the Inter-City West Coast franchise had been awarded to Avanti West Coast, thus confirming that Virgin Trains would cease to operate trains after 7 December 2019. The final Virgin Trains service was the 21:42 service from London Euston to Wolverhampton arriving at 23:45.

==Services==
In May 1998, Virgin introduced two new services from London Euston, to and to . The former ceased in 1999, the latter in May 2003. In December 2014, a daily weekday service between London Euston and Blackpool North and a twice daily service between London Euston and Shrewsbury were reintroduced. This was increased to four trains per day in the May 2018 timetable.

On 23 July 2002, the first elements of the new fleet of Pendolino tilting trains were introduced into passenger services from to , intentionally coinciding with the opening of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.

In September 2004, a London Euston to service was introduced, but it ceased in December 2008.

In September 2005, Virgin introduced its first timetable following the completion of Stage 1 of the upgrade.

In December 2007, as part of a reshuffle of rail franchises by the Department for Transport, services from to and via were transferred from the CrossCountry franchise to the InterCity West Coast franchise.

In December 2008, a to London Euston service was introduced, operating south in the morning with an evening return.

In February 2009, an hourly London Euston to service was introduced.

From January 2009, Virgin Trains gradually rolled out a new &quot;very high frequency&quot; timetable to take advantage of the completed West Coast Main Line upgrade.

There were timetable changes from 8 December 2013. Trains between Edinburgh/Glasgow and London would call at Sandwell &amp; Dudley, replacing the hourly Wolverhampton to Euston service. In addition most Liverpool services additionally called at Crewe.

==Performance==

===Passenger numbers===


===Punctuality===
Virgin Trains suffered poor punctuality compared with some other transport operators between 2001 and 2006, according to Office of Rail Regulation statistics. Punctuality did gradually improve until the introduction of a new timetable (in December 2008), following the upgrade of the West Coast Main Line, which resulted in a dip in performance. Performance subsequently recovered and peaked during 2010–11, but then fell again and reached a new low for the year ending 31 March 2013 of 83.6% (MAA).

The PPM MAA (Public performance measure Moving Annual Average - % of trains arriving within 10 minutes of the scheduled times) figures for Virgin Trains are as follows:

Latest figures published by Network Rail for the seventh period of 2013-2014 recorded PPM of 92.2% for the period and a MAA of 83.5% for the 12 months up to 12 October 2013. The PPM performance for the period is down 2.7 percentage points on the corresponding figure from the same period last year. Network Rail noted that Virgin Trains were only responsible for 16% of delays in period 5. Network Rail was itself directly responsible for 50% of Virgin Trains&#x27; delays, 20% were a result of external factors (e.g. fatalities) and the final 14% were due to other operators.

Chris Green as chief executive led a drive to improve reliability and punctuality after much press criticism in 2001, and by 2006, due to improved reliability of trains and completion of major infrastructure projects, performance was better. Virgin has undertaken a number of projects to increase punctuality, including radio-controlled watches.

==Grayrigg derailment==
On 23 February 2007, a Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; &quot;City of Glasgow&quot; forming the 17:15 London Euston to Glasgow Central service derailed in the village of Grayrigg in Cumbria. The train was carrying 109 people. Several carriages were left lying on the railway embankments. An elderly woman was killed in the derailment. Five people were seriously injured. The accident was caused by a faulty set of points and Network Rail accepted full responsibility. The train itself was widely praised for the way it retained its structural integrity. Branson also praised the driver for attempting to stop the train and not leaving the cab before it derailed.

==Rolling stock==

===Final fleet===
Virgin inherited a fleet of , and s hauling Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages with Driving Van Trailers on its electrified services and High Speed Trains for London Euston to services.

A franchise commitment was the replacement of these trains with new tilting stock. In 1999 Virgin signed a deal to lease forty-four eight-carriage and nine nine-carriage Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot; built by Alstom. An option to extend all to nine carriages was enacted in 2002. The first entered service in January 2003. With the exception of services to Holyhead, the final locomotive hauled trains were withdrawn in June 2005.

To operate the services four four-carriage Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; were included in the order placed by Virgin CrossCountry. By the time they were delivered it was decided these would be too short so they entered service with Virgin CrossCountry. In September 2004 the High Speed Trains were withdrawn with services being operated by a combination of five-carriage Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; hired from Virgin CrossCountry and and hauled Mark 3 sets. From September 2005 Class 57/3s hauling Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot; took over the locomotive hauled diagrams. This continued until December 2008 when five-carriage Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; took over all services, with the exception of a Saturdays only Pendolino hauled by a Class 57/3 Locomotive (1D83 08:50 EUS-HHD/1A55 14:38 HHD-EUS). This ceased operation on Saturday 8 December 2012.

With the Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot; needing modification in 2006, a First GBRf was hired to haul a Mark 3 set on services.

To operate the to Edinburgh and Glasgow services transferred from CrossCountry in December 2007, three four-carriage and thirteen five-carriage Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; were transferred. A further five five-carriage Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; followed in December 2008.

In August 2008 Bombardier started a programme to rearrange the Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; with the carriage containing the shop moved to adjoin the first class carriage and refurbished with 2+2 seats arranged more spaciously around tables. This allowed it to be used as a first class carriage on Holyhead services and as a standard class carriage at other times.

In December 2010 one four-carriage Class 221 &quot;Super Voyager&quot; was disbanded with the two centre carriages being inserted into the other four-carriage sets to give Virgin a fleet of twenty five-carriage Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot;. The two end carriages are stored at Central Rivers depot.

To provide it with a fleet of locomotives for use on diversionary services during the West Coast Mainline upgrade and rescue duties, Virgin signed a deal with Porterbrook in March 2002 to rebuild twelve Class 47s as Class 57/3s with the first delivered in June 2002. After it was decided they would operate daily services along the North Wales Coast to Holyhead, another four were ordered from Porterbrook. Following the completion of the West Coast Main Line upgrade in 2008 their use fell and after being sublet to Arriva Trains Wales, Colas Rail and First GBRf, six were returned to Porterbrook in August 2011, three in April 2012 and the remaining seven in December 2012.

Virgin had long been angling for a franchise extension in return for ordering extra carriages for the Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot;. The Department for Transport rejected this and instead placed an order itself with Alstom for 106 carriages allowing for four complete eleven-carriage sets and 31 sets to be extended by two carriages. There was an option to extend the remaining 21 sets but this was allowed to lapse. The four new sets were delivered in 2010/12 with 31 sets later receiving extra carriages. This required a number of stations to have platforms lengthened.

Following the loss of a Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; in the Grayrigg derailment, a Mark 3 set with a Driving Van Trailer was leased with a hired from English Welsh &amp; Scottish as required. In 2008 Virgin looked at leasing two but decided to retain the Mark 3 set. This received re-upholstered seating, power points, Wi-Fi and a full external re-paint at Wabtec, Doncaster in 2009. Virgin used this set with a Class 90 locomotive hired from Freightliner on a Euston to Crewe (via Birmingham) service on Fridays only until December 2012. From 9 December 2013 it was utilised to operate a London Euston-Birmingham New Street train on Thursdays and Fridays only, until its withdrawal in October 2014.

All seats on Class 221 &quot;Super Voyagers&quot; and Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot; originally had an on-board audio entertainment system featuring a number of radio or pre-recorded music channels. This was disabled in March 2010 and replaced with on-board Wi-Fi provided by EE. The service was available free in first class, and for a charge (which varied depending on how long the passenger wished to use it for) in standard class.

On 15 September 2015 it was announced that Virgin Trains were to rename Pendolino 390002 in memory of teenage fundraiser Stephen Sutton.

===Past fleet===
Former units operated by Virgin Trains include:
==Depots==
The Class 390 fleet was allocated to the Alstom Traincare Centre at Longsight with lighter maintenance and overnight servicing carried out at Wembley, Oxley, Edge Hill and Polmadie depots. The Class 221 fleet was allocated to Bombardier&#x27;s Central Rivers depot with lighter maintenance and overnight servicing carried out at Arriva TrainCare, Crewe, Holyhead and Polmadie.

==West Coast Partnership==
In November 2016, the government announced that the franchise would be replaced by a new franchise named the West Coast Partnership, which will include operating High Speed 2 (HS2). Services are planned to begin on the first phase of HS2 in 2026. The Department for Transport requires that the new operator have experience in operating high-speed trains () and infrastructure. The bid for the new franchise was led by Stagecoach holding a 50% holding, Virgin with 30% and the French national railway operator SNCF holding 20%. In April 2019 Stagecoach revealed that it had been disqualified from the franchises it was bidding for following a dispute with the DfT over pension liabilities. The disqualification occurred after the bidding deadline and as a result Virgin Trains would cease operations in March 2020.

In August 2019, the First Trenitalia consortium was awarded the West Coast Partnership contract, with Avanti West Coast commencing in December 2019, thus ending Virgin Trains services after 22 years.

==Operation==
===Sponsorship===
Virgin Trains were Carlisle United F.C.&#x27;s travel sponsor for the 2013–14 season, and for the 2014–15 season they are the club&#x27;s main shirt sponsor agreeing a further two-year deal. On 5 August 2014 Virgin Trains also agreed to be the shirt sponsor of Preston North End F.C. on a two-year deal. Darlington Football Club were also sponsored by Virgin Trains, and the company has also sponsored events such as Manchester International Festival in 2013.

===Onboard entertainment===
In July 2016 the integrated infotainment system BEAM was provided on all trains by GoMedia, delivered directly to the passenger&#x27;s own devices including mobile phones and tablets. The system has been described as &#x27;the first in-train entertainment portal in the UK&#x27;. It offered premium movies from Hollywood studios, BBC Worldwide etc.

===Moderation of competition===
As a way of protecting the revenues of Virgin Trains to enable it to pay franchise premiums to the government to partly recoup the cost of the West Coast Main Line upgrade, the Office of Rail Regulation inserted a &quot;Moderation of Competition&quot; in Virgin&#x27;s Track Access Agreement. Until its expiry in March 2012, this prevented any other train operating or open access companies operating services in competition that would abstract revenue.

=== Attempts to continue ===
In November 2019, Virgin Trains submitted an open access operator application to the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) for paths to run trains from London Euston to Liverpool Lime Street with Class 221s once they were released by Avanti West Coast with services to begin in December 2022. In March 2020, Virgin withdrew its application for the service, citing uncertainty from the Williams Review of rail not having been published yet.

In May 2024, Virgin Trains submitted an application to the ORR applying for paths from London Euston to Birmingham New Street, Manchester Victoria, Rochdale, Liverpool Lime Street and Glasgow Central.

<doc id="183232" wikidata="Q208762" url="?curid=183232" title="Chaplain">
<text>A chaplain is, traditionally, a cleric (such as a minister, priest, pastor, rabbi, purohit, or imam), or a lay representative of a religious tradition, attached to a secular institution (such as a hospital, prison, military unit, intelligence agency, embassy, school, labor union, business, police department, fire department, university, sports club), or a private chapel. The term chaplaincy refers to the chapel, facility or department in which one or more chaplains carry out their role.

Though the term &quot;chaplain&quot; originally referred to representatives of the Christian faith, it is now also applied to people of other religions or philosophical traditions, as in the case of chaplains serving with military forces and an increasing number of chaplaincies at U.S. universities. In recent times, many lay people have received professional training in chaplaincy and are now appointed as chaplains in schools, hospitals, companies, universities, prisons and elsewhere to work alongside, or instead of, official members of the clergy. The concepts of a &quot;multi-faith team&quot;, &quot;secular&quot;, &quot;generic&quot; or &quot;humanist&quot; chaplaincy are also gaining increasing use, particularly within healthcare and educational settings.

==Types of chaplaincies==

===Education===
School chaplains are a fixture in religious and, more recently, secular schools. In religious schools the role of the chaplain tends to be educational and liturgical. In secular schools the role of the chaplain tends to be that of a mentor and a provider of pastoral care services. Chaplains provide care for students by supporting them during times of crisis or need. Many chaplains run programs to promote the welfare of students, staff and parents including programs to help students deal with grief, anger or depression. Chaplains also build relationships with students by participating in extracurricular activities such as breakfast programs, lunchtime groups and sports groups. School chaplains can also liaise with external organizations providing support services for the school. Many schools now have pupil support departments with several mentors whose jobs are to look out for the pupils and always be there to help but they give no religious or spiritual guidance because of multiculturalism and diverse opinions on religion and beliefs. Chaplains have also been referred to as spiritual animators (also faith animators or pastoral animators) based on the French concept of &quot;animation spirituelle&quot; or spiritual care.

In Australia chaplains in state schools have, controversially, been funded by the federal government and local communities since 2007. Australian chaplains assist school communities to support the spiritual, social, and emotional well-being of their students. Chaplaincy services are provided by non denominational companies. there are 2339 chaplains working in Australian secular schools, along with 512 student welfare workers. Australian schools will lose the option of appointing secular social workers under the national school chaplaincy program, for which the Abbott government has found an extra $245m in the 2014 budget funding.

Similarly, in Scotland the focus of school chaplaincy is on welfare and building positive relationships joining students on excursions and sharing meals. Chaplains are also non-denominational and act as a link between the school community and society. Like Australian chaplains it is expected that they will not proselytise.

In Ireland, chaplaincy takes a very different approach in which chaplains are expected to teach up to four hours of class instruction per week and are usually Catholic themselves. Chaplaincy duties include visiting homes, religious services, retreats and celebrations, as well as counseling.

===Higher education===
For higher education, chaplains are appointed by many colleges and universities, sometimes working directly for the institution, and sometimes as representatives of separate organizations that specifically work to support students, such as Hillel International for Jews or the Newman Centers for Catholics. In the United States, the National Association of college and University Chaplains works to support the efforts of many of these chaplains, helping chaplains minister to the individual faith of students, faculty, and staff, while promoting inter-religious understanding. Chaplains often also oversee programs on campus that foster spiritual, ethical, religious, and political and cultural exchange, and the promotion of service.

===Industrial chaplains===

====Law and police====
Law enforcement or police chaplains work with and as part of local, regional, county, state, and national or federal law enforcement and provide a variety of services within the law enforcement community. They should not be confused with prison chaplains, whose primary ministry is to those who are incarcerated either awaiting trial or after conviction. The role of the law enforcement chaplain deals primarily with law enforcement personnel and agencies. The chaplain responds to these unique needs and challenges with religious guidance, reassuring and trustworthy presence, resources and counseling services. The law enforcement chaplain offers support to law enforcement officers, administrators, support staff, victims and their families, and occasionally even the families of accused or convicted offenders. Law enforcement chaplaincy is a ministry of presence and must have the proper training if they are working with law enforcement officers. Some ministries such as Chaplain Fellowship Ministries requires LEO chaplains to be certified in Public Safety Chaplaincy before becoming certified as a LEO chaplain. Most chaplains are uniformed and some may have a rank. They will always wear distinguishing insignia or markings to denote their chaplain rather than lawman status.

====Fire departments====
Chaplains working with fire departments provide the same kind of support as do chaplains working with law enforcement agencies, and sometimes face even greater danger working with the wounded in often very dangerous surroundings.

At the scene of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, for example, New York City Fire Department chaplain Mychal Judge was killed by flying debris from the South Tower when he re-entered the lobby of the North Tower of the World Trade Center, shortly after administering last rites to a wounded firefighter.

====Labor====

Many workplace chaplains (commonly called industrial chaplains) are sponsored by labor unions, including in some cases chaplains for police and firefighters. The United Auto Workers Union (UAW) sponsors a chaplaincy program for all of its local unions. In New York City, the Electricians Union (IBEW Local 3) has affiliated Catholic, Episcopalian, Greek Orthodox and Masonic organizations with chaplains.

Union chaplains are often viewed as advantageous as they are accountable to the employees and not corporate management.

==== Ports ====
In many ports, particularly in North America and Europe, there are chaplaincy organizations providing religious and welfare services to seafarers while they are in port. This ministry typically takes the form of going aboard ships to talk with seafarers, maintaining centers near the port with chapels, spaces for relaxation, and internet, and providing transportation to seafarers on shore leave. Prominent international seafarers&#x27; ministry organizations include Stella Maris, the Mission to Seafarers, the Sailors&#x27; Society, the Deutsche Seemannsmission, and the International Christian Maritime Association.

====Corporate====
Some businesses, large or small, employ chaplains for their staff or clientele. Services provided may include employee assistance and counseling services; wellness seminars; conflict management and mediation; leadership and management development; and trauma/serious incident response. In 2007, 4,000 corporate chaplains were reported to be working in the U.S., with the majority being employees of specialist chaplaincy companies such as Marketplace Chaplains USA and Corporate Chaplains of America. In 2024, Corporate Chaplains of America reported serving over 2,000 workplace locations with 400 chaplains serving over 1,000,000 employees and their family members in the United States and Canada. 2014, Marketplace Chaplains USA reported employing over 2,800 chaplains in 44 states and over 960 cities. The organization added an international arm in 2006; Marketplace Chaplains International serves Canada, the U.K., Mexico and Puerto Rico. Capellania Empresarial provides corporate chaplaincy services in Paraguay. Chaplains without Borders has been providing corporate and other chaplaincy services in Australia since 2005.

===Military===

Military chaplains provide pastoral, spiritual and emotional support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea, on bases or in the field. Military chaplains have a long history; the first English military-oriented chaplains, for instance, were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the 8th century. Land-based chaplains appeared during the reign of King Edward I. The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the First World War.

Chaplains are nominated, appointed, or commissioned in different ways in different countries. A military chaplain can be an army-trained soldier with additional theological training or an ordained person nominated to the army by religious authorities. In the United Kingdom the Ministry of Defence employs chaplains but their authority comes from their sending church. Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week bespoke induction and training course including a short course at Britannia Royal Naval College and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain. Naval chaplains called to service with the Royal Marines undertake a grueling five-month-long Commando Course and, if successful, wear the commandos&#x27; Green Beret. British Army chaplains undertake seven weeks training at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Beckett House and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Royal Air Force chaplains must complete a 12-week Specialist Entrant course at the RAF College Cranwell followed by the Chaplains&#x27; Induction Course at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Beckett House of a further two weeks. The United States Navy will often give chaplain training to cadets seeking a theological route in the military. Additionally, they are granted instant employment as a Navy chaplain once ordained. Additionally, in the United States military, chaplains must be endorsed by their religious affiliation in order to serve in any facet of the military. In some cases, like that of the U.S. Navy, a Religious Program Specialist may be appointed to help alleviate some of the duties bestowed upon Naval chaplains.


Military chaplains are normally accorded officer status, although Sierra Leone had a Naval Lance Corporal chaplain in 2001. In most navies, their badges and insignia do not differentiate their levels of responsibility and status. By contrast, in air forces and armies, they typically carry ranks and are differentiated by crosses or other equivalent religious insignia. However, United States military chaplains in every branch carry both rank and Chaplain Corps insignia.

Though the Geneva Conventions does not state whether chaplains may bear arms, they specify (Protocol I, June 8, 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are non-combatants. In recent times both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed. Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, make it an issue of individual conscience. Captured chaplains are not considered Prisoners of War (Third Convention, August 12, 1949, Chapter IV Art 33) and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.
Inevitably, a significant number of serving chaplains have died in action. 100 chaplains of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps were killed in action during World War II: a casualty rate greater &quot;than any other branch of the services except the infantry and the Army Air Corps&quot; (Crosby, 1994, pxxiii). Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have won Britain&#x27;s highest award for gallantry, the Victoria Cross). The Chaplain&#x27;s Medal for Heroism is a special U.S. military decoration given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous Four Chaplains, all of whom died in the sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others. In addition to these, five other U.S. chaplains have been awarded the Medal of Honor: Chaplain (LCDR) Joseph T. O&#x27;Callahan, USN (World War II); Chaplain (CPT) Emil Kapaun, USA (Posthumous, Korean War); Chaplain (LT) Vincent R. Capodanno, USN (Posthumous, Vietnam War); Chaplain (MAJ) Charles J. Watters, USA (Posthumous, Vietnam War); and Chaplain (CPT) Angelo J. Liteky, USA (Vietnam). (Later in life, Liteky changed his name to Charles, left the Catholic priesthood, became an anti-war activist, and renounced his Medal of Honor). Chaplain Fellowship Ministries military chaplains are nondenominational. To be considered for appointment to serve as a military chaplain, candidates must first be ordained and have an ecclesiastical endorsement by a valid religious faith group recognized by the Department of Defense. Candidates must meet all DOD requirements. The Chaplain Fellowship had military chaplains serving in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.

In 2006, training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units. The United States European Command has co-sponsored an annual International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference every year since 1991 to consider the various issues affecting chaplaincy ministry and other military personnel. At times, the existence of military chaplains has been challenged in countries that have a separation of Church and State. However one of the major issues affecting chaplaincy and military personnel is that of moral injury arising as a result of international conflicts and terrorism.

===Music===
Some chaplains use live music as a therapeutic tool. Music can aid in healing, access core faith and emotions, and help to build rapport in the chaplaincy relationship.

===Parliamentary===
Some nations, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have chaplains appointed to work with parliamentary bodies, such as the Chaplain of the United States Senate, the Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives, and Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to opening proceedings with prayer, these chaplains provide pastoral counseling to congressional members, their staffs, and their families; coordinate the scheduling of guest chaplains, who offer opening prayers; arrange and sometimes conduct marriages, memorial services, and funeral services for congress, staff, and their families; and conduct or coordinate religious services, study groups, prayer meetings, holiday programs, and religious education programs, as well.

===Royalty and nobility===
Monarchs have held private religious services as a long-standing right along with a privilege of appointing their own chaplains to serve them and their families. Since the late medieval period, dukes and lesser ranking nobles have had a capacity to name a number of chaplains. The question of who has authority to qualify chaplains was the heart of the Investiture Controversy in medieval Germany.

===Prison===

Prison chaplains can be a &quot;safety valve, through listening and pro-social intervention&quot; in potentially explosive situations. They also reduce recidivism by linking offenders to positive community resources, and in the work they do to help offenders change their hearts, minds and directions.

Rabbi Philip R. Alstat (1891–1976), who—in addition to work as a chaplain in New York hospitals and senior citizen facilities—served for three decades as the Jewish chaplain for &quot;The Tombs&quot;, the Manhattan Detention Facility, once described his service as follows: &quot;My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities—to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars.
Mine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart.&quot;

In Canada in 2013, a $2-million contract for chaplaincy services for federal prisons was awarded to Kairos Pneuma Chaplaincy Inc., a company newly formed by five current and former federal prison chaplains. About &quot;2,500 volunteers, many of them of minority faiths, would also continue providing services.&quot; There has however, been very little research looking at the role of chaplains and volunteers working within correctional facilities.

===Sports===
Chaplains to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years. The United States, United Kingdom and Australia have well established Christian sports chaplaincy ministries.

Sports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but occasionally, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration. Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport. This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but also to give them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.

===Animal===

Veterinary chaplains serve people and their animals, ministering with regards to the spirituality associated with animals and their connections with humans. A major function is grief support and prayer. Other services include hospice support while animals are cared for near the end of their lives; support in animal health crises, including at the veterinary hospital; conducting services for animal blessings, naming/adopting ceremonies, and end of life celebration ceremonies. Veterinary chaplains may also offer sermons and spiritual guidance on the human/animal bond and our responsibilities toward animals; and some may visit nursing homes and hospitals with therapeutic animal assistants. Other veterinary chaplains may provide blessings for animal care workers; assist with human/animal communication; and offer alternative healing for animals such as animal Reiki or acupuncture.

===Colonial===
A colonial chaplain was appointed to a colony. The term is commonly used to refer to the chaplain appointed as a non-military chaplain to one of the Crown Colonies from the late 18th century or early 19th century. Richard Johnson (1756–1827) was the first colonial chaplain appointed to the new prison colony at New South Wales in 1786.

===Environmental===
Environmental chaplaincy is an emerging field within chaplaincy. Environmental chaplains (also known as eco-chaplains, Earth chaplains, nature chaplains) provide spiritual care in a way that honors humanity&#x27;s deep connection to the earth. Environmental chaplains hold many roles. They may support people working on the frontlines of issues like climate change or other environmental issues or they may support people impacted by industrial or other disasters by providing pastoral care, presence, and rituals. Environmental chaplains may also bear witness to the Earth itself and represent the merging of science and spirituality. Their role can be to &quot;usher in a new conscience and consciousness to find contentment, the appreciation of inner riches over outer wealth, quality over quantity&quot; using universally appreciated values, such as honesty and vision. Sarah Vekasi created a vision of eco-chaplaincy inspired by Joanna Macy&#x27;s The Work that Reconnects, and saw eco-chaplaincy as a path to facilitating the &quot;Great Turning,&quot; which is described as the turning away from a business-as-usual way of being and turning toward a life-sustaining way that protects people and the planet.

===Health care===
Many hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and hospices employ chaplains to assist with the spiritual, religious, and emotional needs of patients, families and staff. Chaplains are often employed at residential care facilities for the elderly (RCFE) and skilled nursing facilities (SNF) as well. Chaplains care for people of all faiths and no faith. In mental health work, chaplains are highly skilled, working with other therapists as part of a multi-disciplinary team, especially where the patient&#x27;s mental health is associated with their religiosity, or where their mental well-being can be aided by spiritual care.

In the United States, health care chaplains who are board-certified have completed a minimum of four units of Clinical Pastoral Education training. Certification typically requires a Masters of Divinity degree (or its equivalent), faith group ordination or commissioning, faith group endorsement, and four units (1600 hours) of Clinical Pastoral Education (the Military Chaplains Association of the United States of America does require more, but they are a dod2088 501c-3 military support group founded in 1954 by Military Chaplains). The Chaplain Innovation Lab, set up in 2008, has responded rapidly and creatively to the unique pastoral demands of the COVID-19 pandemic; it has 3000 members world-wide.

In Canada, health care chaplains may be certified by the Canadian Association for Spiritual Care.

In the UK, health care chaplains are employed by their local NHS Trust (Health Boards in Scotland and Wales) or by charities associated with delivering health care such as a hospice or private hospital. The NHS in England publishes occasional guidance on chaplaincy practice. UK Chaplains are drawn from a range of faith and belief backgrounds, and are not necessarily ordained or a recognised faith leader. In Scotland Healthcare Chaplaincy developed to be &#x27;generic&#x27; from 2002 onwards; that is the chaplaincy provides spiritual care to all people and chaplains do not represent a faith or belief group. They may work on a full-time and part-time basis, and some work unpaid but with formal recognition for a faith or belief group regarding their training and status and may be termed &quot;honorary&quot; chaplain. The term &quot;Voluntary&quot; Chaplain is frowned on. The largest professional body for the UK is the College of Health Care Chaplains. Scotland historically had a distinct professional body, the Scottish Association of Chaplains in Healthcare (SACH) but this has since dissolved. Northern Ireland also has the Healthcare Chaplains Association. Membership of the College of Health Care Chaplains was historically not open to Catholic Priests as it carries with it the membership of the Unite Trade Union, but this changed in April 2018. Chaplains working in a palliative care setting may also choose to join the Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Chaplains. Other less formal networks also exist supporting Chaplaincy in Paediatric settings and GP based Chaplaincy.

Within the UK there is also the UK Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy (UKBHC) which has been set up in order to regulate the ministry and professional practice of health care chaplains. They publish a code of conduct which all registered chaplains are bound to abide by. The UKBHC has successfully applied to the Professional Standards Authority to be an accredited register of healthcare chaplains demonstrating that it meets the Authority&#x27;s high standards in areas such as governance and training.

Peer-reviewed journals that publish scholarly articles and research on healthcare chaplaincy include the &quot;Journal of Health Care Chaplaincy (USA)&quot;, the international journal &quot;Health and Social Care Chaplaincy&quot; (UK) and the &quot;Journal of Religion and Health&quot; (US).

===Cruise===
Working on board cruise ships, cruise chaplains provide pastoral and spiritual support to both passengers and crew members. With the co-operation of cruise companies, chaplains normally stay on board for the specific duration of a cruise. Catholic seafarers&#x27; charity Apostleship of the Sea currently deploys chaplains on board P&amp;O Cruises and Cunard Line ships during the Christmas and Easter periods. While ministering to passengers are part of Apostleship of the Sea&#x27;s chaplains&#x27; role, their main focus is the welfare of the crew, who can often spend many months at sea away from home.

===Domestic===

A domestic chaplain was a chaplain attached to a noble household in order to grant the family a degree of self-sufficiency in religion. The chaplain was freed from any obligation to reside in a particular place so could travel with the family, internationally if necessary, and minister to their spiritual needs. Further, the family could appoint a chaplain who reflected their own doctrinal views. Domestic chaplains performed family christenings, funerals and weddings and were able to conduct services in the family&#x27;s private chapel, excusing the nobility from attending public worship.

In feudal times most laymen, and for centuries even most noblemen, were poorly educated and the chaplain would also be an important source of scholarship in the household, tutoring children and providing counsel to the family on matters broader than religion. Before the advent of the legal profession, modern bureaucracy and civil service, the literate clergy were often employed as secretarial staff, as in a chancery. Hence the term &quot;clerk&quot;, derived from Latin &quot;clericus&quot; (clergyman). This made them very influential in temporal affairs. There was also a moral impact since they heard the confessions of the elite.

The domestic chaplain was an important part of the life of the peerage in England from the reign of Henry VIII to the middle of the 19th century. Up until 1840, Anglican domestic chaplains were regulated by law and enjoyed the substantial financial advantage of being able to purchase a license to hold two benefices simultaneously while residing in neither.

Many monarchies and major noble houses had, or still have, several domestic or private chaplains as part of their Ecclesiastical Household, either following them or attached to a castle or other residence. Queen Elizabeth II had 36 Anglican chaplains, in addition to chaplains extraordinary and honorary chaplains appointed to minister to her. Castles with attached chaplains generally had at least one Chapel Royal, sometimes as significant as a cathedral. A modern example is St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, also the home of the Order of the Garter.

===Other===

There are also chaplains to private clubs, television or radio stations, family, community teams, groups such as Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Brigade companies and Scout troops, airports, cruise ships, nightclubs, and theaters.

The term can also refer to priests attached to Catholic convents. There is also the position of Chaplain of His Holiness, a title granted by the Pope to certain priests who become part of the Papal Household and work with the Papal Chapel. Prior to 1968 they were called Supernumerary Privy Chamberlains.

In German-speaking countries, the German &quot;Kaplan&quot; is often translated as &quot;chaplain&quot;, but in fact the two words are false friends. &quot;Kaplan&quot; as generally used in German-speaking countries is better translated as curate in British usage, or assistant pastor in American usage.

In the Church of England and other Anglican churches, a Bishop&#x27;s &quot;examining chaplain(s)&quot; are those (usually priests) who examine candidates for ordination and advise the bishop as to their suitability. This role, and ordination processes, have varied greatly in the churches&#x27; history and between the churches.

At the University of Oxford, the term Caplan is used for the position equivalent to president, for the head of the Cymdeithas Dafydd ap Gwilym, (Dafydd ap Gwilym Society) the Oxford University Welsh society, named after the 14th-century Welsh poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym.

<text>The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland (3 SCOTS) is an infantry battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The regiment was created as part of the Childers Reforms in 1881, when the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot (The Black Watch) was amalgamated with the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot. It was known as The Black Watch (Royal Highlanders) from 1881 to 1931 and The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) from 1931 to 2006. Part of the Scottish Division for administrative purposes from 1967, it was the senior Highland regiment. It has been part of the Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division for administrative purposes since 2017.

== Origin of the name ==

The source of the regiment&#x27;s name is uncertain. In 1725, following the Jacobite rebellion of 1715, General George Wade was authorised by George I to form six &quot;watch&quot; companies to patrol the Highlands of Scotland, three from Clan Campbell, one from Clan Fraser of Lovat, one from Clan Munro and one from Clan Grant. These were to be &quot;employed in disarming the Highlanders, preventing depredations, bringing criminals to justice, and hindering rebels and attainted persons from inhabiting that part of the kingdom.&quot; Francis Hindes Groome states in his &quot;Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland&quot; (1901) that the watch was &quot;embodied in a field [in Aberfeldy] in 1739&quot;. The force was known in Gaelic as &quot;Am Freiceadan Dubh,&quot; &quot;the dark&quot; or &quot;black watch&quot;.

This epithet may have come from the uniform plaids of dark tartan with which the companies were provided. Other theories have been put forward; for instance, that the name referred to the &quot;black hearts&quot; of the pro-government militia who had sided with the &quot;enemies of true Highland spirit&quot;, or that it came from their original duty in policing the Highlands, namely preventing &quot;blackmail&quot; (Highlanders demanding extortion payments to spare cattle herds).

== History ==
The regiment was created as part of the Childers Reforms in 1881, when the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot (The Black Watch) was amalgamated with the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot to form two battalions of the newly named Black Watch (Royal Highlanders). The 42nd became the 1st Battalion, and the 73rd became the 2nd Battalion.

The 1st Battalion saw action at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in September 1882 during the Anglo-Egyptian War. It was in combat again during the Mahdist War, at the First and Second Battles of El Teb in February 1884, the Battle of Tamai in March 1884 and at the Battle of Kirbekan in February 1885. They were stationed in India from 1896, but were sent to South Africa for service during the Second Boer War. After the war ended in June 1902 with the Peace of Vereeniging, 630 officers and men left Cape Town on the SS &quot;Michigan&quot; in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton in late October, when they were posted to Edinburgh.

The 2nd Battalion was posted to South Africa in October 1899, following the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The battalion suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Magersfontein in December 1899. After the end of the war, about 730 officers and men left Point Natal for British India on SS &quot;Ionian&quot; in October 1902, where after arrival in Bombay it was stationed in Sialkot in Umballa in Punjab.

In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve and five Territorial battalions.

=== First World War ===
==== Regular Army ====
The 1st Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 1st Brigade in the 1st Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. It saw action during the Retreat from Mons in August 1914, the First Battle of the Marne in September 1914 and the First Battle of the Aisne later in September 1914; it also took part in the advance to the Hindenburg Line in September 1918.

The 2nd Battalion landed at Marseille as part of the Bareilly Brigade in the 7th (Meerut) Division in October 1914 for service on the Western Front. It took part in the defence of Givenchy in December 1915 and then moved to Mesopotamia later that month and saw action during the siege of Kut in Spring 1916, the fall of Baghdad in March 1917 and the Battle of Istabulat in April 1917. It transferred to Palestine in January 1918 and took part in the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918.

==== Territorial Force ====
The 1/4th (City of Dundee) Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the Bareilly Brigade in the 7th (Meerut) Division March 1915 for service on the Western Front and, following heavy losses at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 and the Battle of Festubert in May 1915, amalgamated with 2nd Battalion in September 1915. The 1/5th (Angus and Dundee) Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the 24th Brigade in the 8th Division for service on the Western Front. It also saw action at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 and the Battle of Festubert in May 1915. The 1/6th (Perthshire) Battalion and the 1/7th (Fife) Battalion landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 153rd Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division in May 1915 for service on the Western Front. They saw action at the Battle of the Ancre Heights in October 1916.

====New Army====
=====8th (Service) Battalion=====
The 8th (Service) Battalion was raised in Perth by Lord Sempill of Fintray who had previously served with the Black Watch in the Sudan. Recruiting commenced on 21 August 1914 and the ranks were filled by 3 September 1914. The 8th was the senior battalion in the 26th Infantry Brigade, which in turn was the leading brigade of the 9th (Scottish) Division, the first division of Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Army. As such, the 8th (Service) Battalion can claim to be the vanguard of the &quot;First Hundred Thousand&quot; men in Kitchener&#x27;s K1 Army. The battalion officially formed at Albuera Barracks in August 1914 before moving to Maida Barracks in September 1914. A core cadre of experienced regular and ex-regular officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers formed the backbone of the new unit. The enlisted men came mainly from the cities, farms and collieries of Fife and Forfarshire. 16 January 1915 saw the 26th Infantry Brigade move from Aldershot to Hampshire with the 8th Battalion billeted at Alton. On 22 January 1915 Lord Kitchener inspected the battalion, along with the rest of the 9th (Scottish) Division during downpour of rain on Laffan&#x27;s Plain (now Farnborough Airport). The battalion marched to Oxney Farm Camp near Bordon on 21 March 1915 to undertake a final musketry course where the 8th Battalion Machine Gun Section obtained the highest score in the brigade. In early May 1915, the battalion received the long-awaited orders to proceed overseas to France.

The machine-gun section and battalion transport led the way, sailing to Le Havre via Southampton on 9 May with the bulk of the battalion following on 10 May sailing to Boulogne via Folkestone. The whole battalion then travelled on by train to Arques near Saint-Omer arriving in the early hours of 11 May, from here they heard the distant rumble of the guns at Ypres for the first time. The battalion entered the trenches for the first time on 4 July 1915, relieving the 5th (Service) Battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders in the front line East of Festubert, they were relieved in turn on 7 July 1915 by 10th (Service) Battalion of the Highland Light Infantry. In this short four day introduction to trench warfare, the battalion lost three men killed and seven wounded.

On 25 September 1915, the battalion took a leading role in the opening actions of the Battle of Loos. During three hard days of fighting at Loos, the battalion lost 19 officers and 492 other ranks either killed or wounded. This included the Commanding Officer Lt Col Lord Sempill, the Second in Command Major J. G. Collins, three of the four Company Commanders and the Regimental Sergeant Major W. H. Black. Another notable casualty at Loos was Captain The Hon. Fergus Bowes-Lyon, the elder brother of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon who would later marry the future King George VI.

The 8th (Service) Battalion spent the rest of the war in the trenches of the Western Front and took part in a number of key battles.

*1916 – Battle of Bazentin Ridge
*1917 – First battle of the Scarpe, Third Battle of the Scarpe, First Battle of Passchendale
*1918 – First Battle of Bapaume, Battle of Messines, First Battle of Kemmel Ridge, Second Battle of Kemmel Ridge, Fifth Battle of Ypres, Battle of Courtrai

Following the armistice, demobilization began on 27 December 1918 and men were released in batches during the following months. In mid-August 1919 the remnants of the battalion returned to England, sailing from Calais to Folkestone before marching to Shorncliffe where trains were boarded to Brocton Camp. Demobilization continued and on 15 November 1919, the battalion was reduced to Cadre strength. Following the dispersal of the remaining officers and other ranks, the Commanding Officer, Adjutant and Quartermaster returned to the Black Watch Depot in Perth where the battalion was officially disbanded in mid-December 1919. During active service between 1915 and 1918 the 8th (Service) Battalion lost a total of 169 officers (69 killed/93 wounded/8 missing) and 3,597 other ranks (1,123 killed/1,673 wounded/510 missing). The bravery of the 8th is reflected in the number of gallantry decorations awarded, this includes 7 Distinguished Service Orders, 32 Military Crosses, 38 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 6 Meritorious Service Medals and 137 Military Medals.

=====9th (Service) Battalion=====
The 9th (Service) Battalion was raised from an initial draft of 200 men sent from Perth to join the 8th (Service) Battalion at Aldershot on 6 September 1914. As the 8th Battalion was already fully manned, permission was granted to form a second unit from the drafts reaching the 8th Battalion between 6 September and 9 September, forming part of Kitchener&#x27;s K2 Army. This became the 9th (Service) Battalion under the command of Major T.O. Lloyd, an ex-regular Black Watch officer who had retired from 1st Battalion in 1909.

The new battalion lacked experienced officers and Lord Sempill, the Commanding Officer of 8th Battalion, consented to transfer one of his three regular officers to 9th Battalion to act as Adjutant. At company level, almost all of the officers were newly commissioned Second Lieutenants with no prior military experience. The same was true of the non-commissioned officers, with the exception of the RSM, two former Colour Sergeants and a few old and bold ex soldiers, all NCO&#x27;s were new to the army and promoted to acting rank on the recommendation of their company commander.

September to November was spent training at Albuhera Barracks in Aldershot, where on 26 September the battalion paraded for the first time as a complete unit in front of the King, Queen and Lord Kitchener as part of the 44th Brigade in the 15th (Scottish) Division. On this first formal parade, all of the division wore civilian clothes as uniforms had yet to be issued; it was not until the middle of October that the men were all dressed alike. and kilts did not arrive until 20 January 1915. by which time the battalion had taken up billets in the village of Liss in Hampshire. On 23 February 1915, the battalion moved to Chiseldon Camp in Wiltshire and commenced musketry training on 1 March; at this point only 25 service rifles were available. 12 May 1915 saw the battalion move with the rest of the 44th Brigade to Parkhouse Camp in the Salisbury Plain Training Area to conduct brigade manoeuvres. The King inspected the 15th Division a second time on 21 June 1915 and was greatly impressed at the progress made in such a short space of time.

On 4 July 1915, the battalion received embarkation orders for France. The machine gun and transport sections led the way and departed Parkhouse Camp on 7 July sailing on the  that night from Southampton to Le Havre. The bulk of the battalion left Parkhouse early on 8 July, sailing on the SS &quot;Invicta&quot; from Folkestone and arriving in Boulogne that same evening. The 9th (Service) Battalion first entered the trenches on 2 August 1915 when it relieved 23rd/24th Battalions of the London Regiment in a section of the line East of Maroc and opposite the famous &#x27;Double Crassier&#x27;. The battalion was in turn relieved on 9 August 1915 by 10th Battalion Scottish Rifles. To their credit, the battalion suffered no casualties during this first introduction to trench warfare. On 25 September 1915. the battalion went in to action at the Battle of Loos where it suffered severe losses in two days of hard fighting. Of the 940 officers and men who went into action on 25 September, only 98 returned to their billets when the battalion was relieved by 21st Division on 26 September. The battalion lost a total of 701 men at Loos: 11 officers killed and 10 wounded with 360 other ranks killed or missing and 320 wounded.

The 9th (Service) Battalion spent the rest of the war in the trenches of the Western Front and took part in a number of key battles.

*1916 – Battle of Delville Wood, Battle of Flers-Courcelette
*1917 – First battle of the Scarpe, Second Battle of the Scarpe, Battle of Pilckem Ridge, Battle of the Menin Road Ridge
*1918 – First Battle of Bapaume, First Battle of Arras

On 11 May 1918, the original 9th (Service) Battalion left the line for the final time and was merged with the 4/5th Territorial Battalion. This amalgamation was part of measures taken to address the drain on manpower across the British Army. Whilst the bulk of the 9th went to the 4/5th a small training cadre of 10 officers and 51 other ranks remained and were initially employed training newly arrived American troops. Later that month the cadre returned to Aldershot where they spent two months raising and training a new unit which became 2/9th (Service) Battalion assigned to the 47th Brigade, 16th (Irish) Division. The 2/9th left Aldershot on 30 July 1918 sailing from Folkestone to Boulogne and reaching billets at Hodecq the following day. The next eighteen days were spent training before 2/9th entered the battle area at Noeux-les-Mines on 19 August 1918 where it relieved the 1st Battalion. On 21 August the battalion proceeded by rail to Sailly-Labourse where it supported the 14th Leicesters and 18th Welch holding the line in the Hohenzollern Sector. On 2 September 1918, the battalion was involved in a costly trench raid losing 31 men. The battalion advanced with the 16th Division until 20 October 1918 when it was assigned the task of repairing roads around Escoeuilles where it was when the armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. Following the armistice, the battalion started the process of demobilization and found itself at Fretin by 27 November 1918 where it remained until Spring 1919 when it was reduced to cadre strength and moved to Pont-a-Marcq. The cadre returned to Scotland in July 1919 where the 2/9th was finally disbanded. During active service between 1915 and 1918 the battalion lost 140 officers (46 killed/88 wounded/6 missing) and 2,899 other ranks (645 killed/2,029 wounded/225 missing). The bravery of the 9th is reflected in the number of gallantry decorations awarded, including 3 Distinguished Service Orders, 28 Military Crosses, 7 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 2 Meritorious Service Medals and 65 Military Medals.

=====10th (Service) Battalion=====
The 10th (Service) Battalion was raised in Perth at the beginning of September 1914 under Lt Col Sir William Stewart Dick-Cunyngham, 8th Baronet of Lambrughton. By 20 September 1914, a core body of 400 men had volunteered and were sent south to train at Shrewton in the Salisbury Plain Training Area, where the 10th was to form part of the 77th Infantry Brigade alongside the 10th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 11th Battalion Scottish Rifles and 8th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers as part of Kitchener&#x27;s K3 Army. Officers were gradually appointed to the battalion; some had previous Regular or Territorial military experience but the majority had none. November saw the battalion move to Bristol where the men practised trench digging in Ashton Park. The men were comfortably quartered in several public buildings: A and C companies occupied Colston Hall, B the Victoria Gallery and D the Coliseum (a large ice skating rink); the officers were billeted at the Colston Hotel. In the New Year, makeshift uniforms were finally replaced by the coveted kilt and sporran. March 1915 saw the 77th Infantry Brigade move to Sutton Veny to engage in brigade and divisional manoeuvres with the 26th Division. Training was completed by the end of July 1915 and during August three days &#x27;farewell&#x27; leave was granted to officers and men. On 10 September 1915 embarkation orders were received and on 17 September an advance party of 5 officers and 109 other ranks left for France, arriving at Longueau on 20 September before marching 20 miles to Bougainville to arrange billets for the battalion. The bulk of the battalion soon followed, leaving Folkestone at 6pm on 20 September aboard the SS &quot;La Marguerite&quot; and arriving at Boulogne around midnight. The rest of the night was spent under canvas at Ostrahove Camp, and next morning the battalion boarded trains to Sallux before marching the final fifteen miles to rendezvous with the advance party at Bougainville.

On 23 September 1915, the battalion received orders to march to Salouël which was reached at midnight after seven hour&#x27;s march in torrential rain. The following morning the 77th Infantry Brigade marched on to Villers-Bretonneux and were inspected on the road by the XII Corps Commander Lt-Gen Sir Henry Fuller Maitland Wilson who congratulated the 10th battalion on its march discipline and fine appearance. The battalion spent five days training at Villers-Bretonneux where the men could hear the distant rumbling of the artillery supporting the Battle of Loos, for which 10th Battalion was held in reserve. On 29 September 1915, the battalion left for Proyart and the companies entered the front line trenches for the first time for forty-eight hours of instruction with the resident units. A and D companies joined 2nd Battalion Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry in the line at Fontaine-lès-Cappy, with B and C companies rotating in on 2 October with the Royal Irish Fusiliers.

The battalion took responsibility for its first stretch of the line on 14 October when it relieved the King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry around Bray, with battalion HQ located in the town of Carnoy. On 5 November the battalion received orders to prepare for immediate deployment to Salonika to participate in operations on the Macedonian front. On 10 November the battalion marched to Longueau from where they boarded trains to Marseille which they reached soon after midday on 12 November. The battalion marched straight to the quay to begin boarding HMS &quot;Magnificent&quot; alongside two companies from the 11th Battalion Worcestershire Regiment and two companies from the 12th Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. The course followed was north of Corsica, passing Elba, south through the Straits of Messina, along the coast of Sicily and on to Alexandria, which was reached on 18 November 1915. At Alexandria, the men disembarked and spent the night at Maritza Camp before re-embarking on HMS &quot;Magnificent&quot; and sailing for Salonika, which was reached on 24 November.

The 10th Battalion spent the rest of 1915 and early 1916 constructing and manning part of the &#x27;Birdcage Defensive Line&#x27; in the hills surrounding Salonika; the stretch of line allocated to the 10th ran between the villages of Aivatli and Laina. June 1916 saw the battalion move &#x27;up country&#x27;, spending time in division reserve and manning trenches in the Vladaja Line. On 8 May 1917, the 10th Battalion took part in the Battle of Doiran. Out of 600 men engaged in this action, the 10th lost 5 officers killed and 6 wounded, with 63 other ranks killed and 309 wounded. Due to losses incurred as a result of the German spring offensive it was decided that one battalion in each brigade would be withdrawn from Greece and transferred to the Western Front. On 14 June 1918, the 10th Battalion received orders to move to France, with the men embarking on the French transport &quot;Odessa&quot; at Itea on 6 July, bound for Taranto. From Italy, the battalion travelled by train to Abancourt, finally reaching the rest camp on 14 July, and were attached to 197th Infantry Brigade in the 66th Division. On 20 September, the battalion was informed that they were to be disbanded, with orders received on 29 September to send one complete company to each of the 1st, 6th and 14th Black Watch Battalions to replace losses. On 15 October, the disbandment of the 10th (Service) Battalion was reported as complete to 197th Infantry Brigade. During active service between 1915 and 1918 the 10th (Service) Battalion lost a total of 18 officers (8 killed/10 wounded) and 435 other ranks (122 killed/311 wounded/2 missing). The bravery of the 10th is reflected in the number of gallantry decorations awarded, including 2 Distinguished Service Orders, 6 Military Crosses, 3 Distinguished Conduct Medals, 3 Meritorious Service Medals and 10 Military Medals.

=== Second World War ===
==== Regular Army ====


The 1st Battalion landed in France in September 1939 as part of the 12th Brigade in the 4th Infantry Division for service with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The battalion later transferred to the 153rd Brigade of the 51st (Highland) Division and was captured at St Valery-en-Caux during the Battle of France. It was reformed from reserve units of the 9th (Highland) Infantry Division in August 1940 and moved to North Africa in August 1942 where it fought at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 and then continued to fight in the Tunisian Campaign before it took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943. It also took part in the Normandy landings in June 1944, the Battle for Caen later that month and the Battle of the Falaise Pocket in August 1944. It later saw action at the Battle of the Bulge in January 1945, Battle of the Reichswald in February 1945 and the crossing of the Rhine in March 1945.

The 2nd Battalion was serving in Palestine from where it was sent to East Africa in August 1940 and saw action during the Italian conquest of British Somaliland. It was sent to Crete, as part of the 14th Brigade in the 8th Division, and took part in the Battle of Heraklion in May 1941. It moved to North Africa in October 1941 and took part in the break out from Tobruk in November 1941.

==== Territorial Army ====
The 4th Battalion landed in France in January 1940 as part of the 153rd Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division for service with the BEF and then took part in the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940. From July 1940 to April 1943 the battalion was stationed in Gibraltar. The battalion remained in the United Kingdom for the rest of the war.

The 5th Battalion landed in North Africa as part of the 153rd Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division and fought at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. It also took part in the Normandy landings, while attached to the 3rd Parachute Brigade, in June 1944 and saw action at the Battle for Caen followed by the Battle of Bréville later that month. It saw combat again at the Battle of the Falaise Pocket in August 1944 and the Battle of the Bulge in January 1945.

The 6th Battalion landed in France in January 1940 as part of the 154th Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division for service with the BEF. The battalion exchanged places with the 1st Battalion and became part of the 12th Brigade of the 4th Division and then took part in the Dunkirk evacuation in June 1940. It moved to North Africa in the spring of 1943 for service in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign and then on to the Italian Front in February 1944 where it took part in the Battle of Monte Cassino in the spring of 1944. The battalion later fought on the Gothic Line before being sent to Greece in late 1944, where it remained for the rest of the war.

The 7th Battalion landed in North Africa as part of the 154th Brigade in the 51st (Highland) Division and fought at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. It also took part in the Normandy landings in June 1944, the Battle for Caen later that month and the Battle of the Falaise Pocket in August 1944. It later saw action at the Battle of the Bulge in January 1945. The 7th Battalion was also one of the first battalions to cross the river Rhine during Operation Plunder on the 23 March 1945.

=== Postwar ===
The 2nd Battalion was deployed to India in 1945 and arrived at Cherat Cantonment, thirty-four miles from Peshawar, on 15 August 1947, when India and Pakistan became independent. In February 1946, the Black Watch was deployed to suppress the Royal Indian Navy mutiny at Karachi. On 26 February 1948 the battalion became the last British Army unit to leave Pakistan, boarding a transport ship at Karachi, after a formal parade through the streets with the salute taken by the Prime Minister Jinnah.

The regiment won honours after the Second Battle of the Hook in November 1952 during the Korean War. The regiment helped to suppress the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya in 1953 and to suppress the actions of EOKA during intercommunal violence in Cyprus in the late 1950s.

During the state funeral of John F. Kennedy in November 1963, nine bagpipers from the regimental band which had been on tour in the USA were invited to participate in the funeral procession. Between the White House and the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle they performed &quot;The Brown Haired Maiden&quot;, &quot;The Badge of Scotland&quot;, &quot;The 51st Highland Division&quot;, and &quot;The Barren Rocks of Aden.&quot; The Black Watch had won such renown that in December 1964 during an Anglo-American summit, President Lyndon Johnson asked the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson to send the Black Watch to Vietnam, a request that was refused.

The Black Watch served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles as part of Operation Banner. The regiment was frequently a major target of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). A lance corporal serving with the regiment was shot by a sniper in East Belfast in November 1971 and a young private serving with the regiment was killed while on foot patrol in Dungannon, County Tyrone, by a remote control device in July 1978.

==== Hong Kong handover ceremony ====

The Black Watch was the last British military unit to leave Hong Kong in 1997, and it played a prominent role in the handover ceremony.

== Modern day ==
During the 2003 Iraq War, the Black Watch fought during Operation Telic in the initial attack on Basra, and during its deployment, the unit suffered a single fatality. The following year, the Black Watch was dispatched to Iraq again, as part of 4 (Armoured) Brigade. On 12 August, a soldier from the regiment was killed as a result of an improvised explosive device (IED). In October, the Black Watch was at the centre of political controversy after the United States Army requested British forces to be moved further north, outside of the British-controlled Multi-National Division (South East), to replace forces temporarily redeployed for the Second Battle of Fallujah. Despite objections in Parliament, the deployment went ahead. Based at Camp Dogwood, located between Fallujah and Karbala, in an area later dubbed the &quot;Triangle of Death&quot;, the Black Watch came under sustained insurgent attack from mortars and rockets. On 29 October, during the journey to their new base, a Black Watch soldier was killed in a road accident. On 4 November, three soldiers and an interpreter were killed by a car bomb at a check point, and on 8 November, another soldier was killed: the high-profile nature of the deployment caused a magnification of these events back home in Britain.

Under a plan devised by Lieutenant General Alistair Irwin and approved by General Sir Mike Jackson, on 16 December 2004, it was announced that the Black Watch was to join with five other Scottish regiments – the Royal Scots, the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, the Royal Highland Fusiliers, The Highlanders and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders – to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland, a single regiment consisting of five regular and two territorial battalions. The measure, which reflected recruiting difficulties and the inefficiencies inherent in maintaining a number of relatively small separate units, took place on 28 March 2006. The Black Watch were retained following intervention from Queen Elizabeth II.

In July 2007 the battalion moved from Palace Barracks in Belfast to Fort George.

On 24 June 2009, it was reported that elements of the battalion numbering about 350 troops carried out one of the largest air assault operations of the NATO troops in Afghanistan, named Operation Panther&#x27;s Claw, by deploying into and attacking a Taliban stronghold located near Bābājī (باباجی ), north of Lashkar Gah. The operation commenced on 19 June just before midnight. After a number of combat engagements with the insurgents, the soldiers of the battalion secured three main crossing points: the Lui Mandey Wadi crossing, the Nahr-e-Burgha canal and the Shamalan canal. Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Cartwright, Commanding Officer of The Black Watch battalion, was reported saying that this operation established a firm foothold in what was the last remaining Taliban area controlled in the southern Helmand Province. The location of the Taliban force in the area had allowed it to conduct attacks on the A01 highway, a major national route connecting Kandahar and Herat. During 22 June, troops of the battalion also &quot;found 1.3 tonnes of poppy seed and a number of improvised explosive devices and anti-personnel mines before they could be laid.&quot; Analysis by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation revealed the haul to be of mung beans, not poppy seed.

Following the Army 2020 Refine reorganisation, the battalion was to remain at Fort George until 2023 where it was to move to another barracks in Scotland. This would later be changed in 2021 with the battalion to relocate to Leuchars in 2029 instead. Following the reorganisation, the battalion was equipped with the Foxhound light mechanised vehicle. The battalion was also moved under the command of the 51st Infantry Brigade and Headquarters Scotland.

In the later part of 2023 the battalion was subordinated to 11th Security Forces Assistance Brigade in Aldershot. The battalion was reduced to 301 personnel, in line with a Security Forces Assistance Battalion order of battle.

11th SFA Brigade was redesignated 11th Brigade in 2024, transitioning back to Field Army Troops, with the combat role of tactical recce-strike.

Before and after the Second World War, the Australian Militia, later renamed the Citizen Military Forces (CMF), included the 30th Battalion, New South Wales Scottish Regiment. This unit was affiliated with the Black Watch.

Canada (from 1862) has its own Black Watch, being raised as the 5th Battalion of the Canadian Militia, being renamed by 1914 as the 5th Regiment (Royal Highlanders of Canada). It adopted its current title, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada, prior to the Second World War, and saw action in both world wars.

New Zealand raised the New Zealand Scottish Regiment in 1939, which was allied to the Black Watch and disbanded in 2013.

== Anecdotes ==
When wearing the kilt, it is customary for troops to &quot;go regimental&quot; or &quot;military practice&quot;, wearing no underwear. In 1997, a Black Watch soldier received wide press exposure because of windy conditions during a military ceremony in Hong Kong.

== In popular culture ==
* Anthems associated with the regiment include &quot;Wha Saw the Forty-Second&quot;, (&quot;Wha saw the Forty Twa&quot;) a reworking of the Jacobite song &quot;Wha Wadna Fecht For Charlie&quot;, &quot;The Gallant Forty Twa&quot;, and &quot;Twa Recruiting Sergeants&quot;.
* In 2006, the National Theatre of Scotland premiered a new play, &quot;Black Watch&quot;, by Gregory Burke at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Compiled from interviews with former soldiers, the play dealt with the history of the regiment and in particular the recent deployment in Iraq.
* The regiment are lambasted in an Irish rebel song &quot;The Black Watch&quot;, recorded by various artists such as the Irish Brigade, the Fighting Men of Crossmaglen, Athenry and Shebeen, for their role in the Troubles. The lyrics speak of the Black Watch, &quot;strolling down the Falls Road with riot guns and gas, terrorising women as they&#x27;re coming out of Mass.&quot; (The tune is taken from the earlier song &quot;The Gallant Forty-Twa&quot;.)
* The tabletop game Battletech features a fictionalized version of the Black Watch known as the Royal Black Watch Regiment, serving as the bodyguard of the First Lord of the Star League and using the same insignia and motto as their real life counterparts.

<text>At the Battle of Taginae (also known as the Battle of Busta Gallorum) in June/July 552, the forces of the Byzantine Empire under Narses broke the power of the Ostrogoths in Italy, and paved the way for the temporary Byzantine reconquest of the Italian Peninsula.

==Prelude==
From as early as 549 the Emperor Justinian I had planned to dispatch a major army to Italy to conclude the protracted war with the Ostrogoths initiated in 535. During 550–51 a large expeditionary force totaling 20,000 or possibly 25,000 men was gradually assembled at Salona on the Adriatic, comprising regular Byzantine units and a large contingent of foreign allies, notably Lombards, Heruls, and Bulgars. The imperial chamberlain (&quot;cubicularius&quot;) Narses was appointed to command in mid 551. The following spring Narses led this Byzantine army around the coast of the Adriatic as far as Ancona, and then turned inland aiming to march down the Via Flaminia to Rome.

==Deployment==
At a place known as Busta Gallorum (, lit. &quot;tombs of the Gauls&quot;), near the village of Taginae or Tadinae (traditionally located somewhere to the north of modern Gualdo Tadino), the Byzantines encountered the Ostrogothic army commanded by King Totila, who had been advancing to intercept them. Finding himself considerably outnumbered, Totila ostensibly entered into negotiations while planning a surprise attack, but Narses was not fooled by this stratagem.

Although he enjoyed superiority in numbers, Narses deployed his army in a strong defensive position. In the centre he massed the large body of Germanic mercenaries dismounted in a dense formation and placed the Byzantine troops to either side. On each wing he stationed 4,000 foot-archers.

==Battle==
Totila initially attempted to outflank his opponent by seizing a small hill on the Byzantine left which dominated the only route to the rear of the Byzantine line, but some of the Byzantine infantry deployed in a compact well-shielded formation managed to beat off successive attacks of the Ostrogothic cavalry.

Having failed to turn Narses&#x27; position, and expecting 2,000 reinforcements from Teia, Totila used various expedients to delay the battle, including disingenuous offers of negotiation and duels enacted between the battle-lines. In one such occasion, Totila sent a Byzantine deserter named Coccas out to challenge any Byzantine to single combat. Coccas was large and immensely strong. He had a reputation among the Goths as a ruthless and powerful fighter. An Armenian named Anzalas, one of Narses&#x27; bodyguards, answered the challenge. Coccas charged at Anzalas, but at the last moment, Anzalas swerved his horse and stabbed the Gothic champion in the side. It was not the most auspicious omen for the Ostrogoths.

However, the Ostrogothic king had another delaying tactic. Both armies watched as Totila, dressed in shining purple and gold armor, and riding a huge stallion, cantered out towards the space between the two large armies. His horse went circles, reared, pirouetted, and ran backwards as Totila tossed his lance into the air and caught it. At last, he rode back to his own army and changed into battle armor. Teia had arrived.

His reinforcements having arrived, Totila broke formation and retired for lunch. Narses, wary of a possible ruse, permitted his troops to refresh themselves without leaving their positions. Totila, apparently hoping to take his enemy by surprise, launched a sudden large-scale mounted assault upon the Byzantine center. Ancient and modern authors have accused him of folly, but Totila probably sought to close with the enemy as fast as possible in order to avoid the effects of the formidable Byzantine archers. The Byzantines were prepared for such a move, however, and the archers massed on the flanks to incline their front towards the center so that his battle-line became crescent-shaped. Caught in the enfilading fire from both sides, the Ostrogothic cavalry sustained high casualties and their attack faltered. The course and duration of the subsequent battle are uncertain, but towards early evening Narses ordered a general advance, and the Ostrogoths broke and fled. Although accounts vary, it was probably during the subsequent rout that Totila was killed.

==Aftermath==
Narses proceeded to Rome which fell with limited resistance. The Ostrogoths regrouped under Totila&#x27;s successor Teia, but suffered a final defeat at the Battle of Mons Lactarius (near Mount Vesuvius) and thereafter were most likely absorbed into the Lombards, another Germanic tribe that invaded Italy in the 6th century.

<text>Enger () is a town in the Herford district, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Enger is situated between the Teutoburg Forest and the Wiehen Hills, approx. 6 km west of the town of Herford, the capital of the district.

===Neighbouring places===
* Spenge
* Bünde
* Hiddenhausen
* Herford
* Bielefeld

=== Town divisions ===
Enger consists of the following districts (population as of December 31, 2005): 
* Belke-Steinbeck (2,471 inhabitants)
* Besenkamp (1,849 inhabitants)
* Dreyen (1,404 inhabitants)
* Enger (7,809 inhabitants)
* Herringhausen (West) (430 inhabitants)
* Oldinghausen (773 inhabitants)
* Pödinghausen (2,181 inhabitants)
* Siele (122 inhabitants)
* Westerenger (3,797 inhabitants)

==History==
The town, first mentioned in 948, calls itself &quot;Widukind&#x27;s town.&quot; The Saxon leader Widukind died about 808. However, there is no evidence that Enger existed in his lifetime.

A legend tells that Widukind founded a church in Enger after his baptism, and that he lived at the place until his death. He was buried in the church of Enger, and his monumental tomb is still there.
Despite this, it remains doubtful that the remains of Widukind are actually in the tomb. Analysis shows that the memorial slab dates to the time around the year 1100.

The main current attractions of Enger are Widukind&#x27;s tomb, the Widukind museum, the Widukind festival (&quot;Timpkenfest&quot;), held annually on January 6 and the &quot;Kirschblütenfest&quot; in April.

==Notable people==

* Wolfgang Aßbrock (1952–2007), politician and member of the North Rhine-Westphalian Parliament (2005–2007)

<doc id="183241" wikidata="Q7426087" url="?curid=183241" title="Satellite modem">
<text>A satellite modem or satmodem is a modem used to establish data transfers using a communications satellite as a relay. A satellite modem&#x27;s main function is to transform an input bitstream to a radio signal and vice versa. 

There are some devices that include only a demodulator (and no modulator, thus only allowing data to be downloaded by satellite) that are also referred to as &quot;satellite modems.&quot; These devices are used in satellite Internet access (in this case uploaded data is transferred through a conventional PSTN modem or an ADSL modem).

== Satellite link ==
A satellite modem is not the only device needed to establish a communication channel. Other equipment that is essential for creating a satellite link include satellite antennas and frequency converters.

Data to be transmitted are transferred to a modem from data terminal equipment (e.g. a computer). The modem usually has intermediate frequency (IF) output (that is, 50-200 MHz), however, sometimes the signal is modulated directly to L band. In most cases, frequency has to be converted using an upconverter before amplification and transmission.

A modulated signal is a sequence of &quot;symbols&quot;, pieces of data represented by a corresponding signal state, e.g. a bit or a few bits, depending upon the modulation scheme being used. Recovering a symbol clock (making a local symbol clock generator synchronous with the remote one) is one of the most important tasks of a demodulator.

Similarly, a signal received from a satellite is firstly downconverted (this is done by a Low-noise block converter - LNB), then demodulated by a modem, and at last handled by data terminal equipment. The LNB is usually powered by the modem through the signal cable with 13 or 18 V DC.

== Features ==
The main functions of a satellite modem are modulation and demodulation. Satellite communication standards also define error correction codes and framing formats.

Popular modulation types being used for satellite communications:
* Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK);
* Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK);
* Offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK);
* 8PSK;
* Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), especially 16QAM.

The popular satellite error correction codes include:
* Convolutional codes:
** with constraint length less than 10, usually decoded using a Viterbi algorithm (see Viterbi decoder);
** with constraint length more than 10, usually decoded using a Fano algorithm (see Sequential decoder);
* Reed–Solomon codes usually concatenated with convolutional codes with an interleaving;
* New modems support superior error correction codes (turbo codes and LDPC codes).

Frame formats that are supported by various satellite modems include:
* Intelsat business service (IBS) framing
* Intermediate data rate (IDR) framing
* MPEG-2 transport framing (used in DVB)
* E1 and T1 framing

High-end modems also incorporate some additional features:

* Multiple data interfaces (like RS-232, RS-422, V.35, G.703, LVDS, Ethernet);
* &quot;Embedded Distant-end Monitor and Control&quot; (EDMAC), allowing to control the distant-end modem;
* &quot;Automatic Uplink Power Control&quot; (AUPC), that is, adjusting the output power to maintain a constant signal to noise ratio at the remote end;
* Drop and insert feature for a multiplexed stream, allowing to replace some channels in it.

== Internal structure ==

Probably the best way of understanding how a modem works is to look at its internal structure. A block diagram of a generic satellite modem is shown on the image. 

=== Analog tract ===
After a digital-to-analog conversion in the transmitter, the signal passes through a reconstruction filter. Then, if needed, frequency conversion is performed. 

The purpose of the analog tract in the receiver is to convert signal&#x27;s frequency, to adjust its power via an automatic gain control circuit and to get its complex envelope components.

The input signal for the analog tract is at the intermediate frequency, sometimes, in the L band, in which case it must be converted to an IF. Then the signal is either sampled or processed by the four-quadrant multiplier which produces the complex envelope components (&quot;I, Q&quot;) through multiplying it by the heterodyne frequency (see superheterodyne receiver).

At last the signal passes through an anti-aliasing filter and is sampled or (digitized).

=== Modulator and demodulator ===
A digital modulator transforms a digital stream into a radio signal at the intermediate frequency (IF). A modulator is generally simpler than a demodulator because it doesn&#x27;t have to recover symbol and carrier frequencies.

A demodulator is one of the most important parts of the receiver. The exact structure of the demodulator is defined by a modulation type. However, the fundamental concepts are similar. Moreover, it is possible to develop a demodulator that can process signals with different modulation types.

Digital demodulation implies that a &quot;symbol clock&quot; (and, in most cases, an intermediate frequency generator) at the receiving side has to be synchronous with those at the transmitting side. This is achieved by the following two circuits:
* timing recovery circuit, determining the borders of symbols;
* carrier recovery circuit, which determines the actual meaning of each symbol. There are modulation types (like frequency-shift keying) that can be demodulated without carrier recovery, however, this method, known as &quot;noncoherent demodulation&quot;, is generally worse.

There are also additional components in the demodulator such as the intersymbol interference equalizer.

If the analog signal was digitized without a four-quadrant multiplier, the complex envelope has to be calculated by a digital &quot;complex mixer&quot;.

Sometimes a digital automatic gain control circuit is implemented in the demodulator.

=== FEC coding ===
Error correction techniques are essential for satellite communications, because, due to satellite&#x27;s limited power a signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver is usually rather poor. Error correction works by adding an artificial redundancy to a data stream at the transmitting side and using this redundancy to correct errors caused by noise and interference. This is performed by an &quot;FEC encoder.&quot; The encoder applies an error correction code to the digital stream, thereby adding redundancy.

An &quot;FEC decoder&quot; decodes the Forward error correction code used within the signal. For example, the Digital Video Broadcasting standard defines a concatenated code consisting of inner convolutional (standard NASA code, punctured, with rates formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, formula_5), interleaving and outer Reed–Solomon code (block length: 204 bytes, information block: 188 bytes, can correct up to 8 bytes in the block).

=== Differential coding ===
There are several modulation types (such as PSK and QAM) that have a phase ambiguity, that is, a carrier can be restored in different ways. Differential coding is used to resolve this ambiguity.

When differential coding is used, the data are deliberately made to depend not only on the current &quot;symbol&quot;, but also on the previous one.

=== Scrambling ===

Scrambling is a technique used to randomize a data stream to eliminate long &#x27;0&#x27;-only and &#x27;1&#x27;-only sequences and to assure energy dispersal. Long &#x27;0&#x27;-only and &#x27;1&#x27;-only sequences create difficulties for timing recovery circuit. Scramblers and descramblers are usually based on linear-feedback shift registers.

A scrambler randomizes the transmitted data stream. A descrambler restores the original stream from the scrambled one.

Scrambling shouldn&#x27;t be confused with encryption, since it doesn&#x27;t protect information from intruders.

=== Multiplexing ===
A multiplexer transforms several digital streams into one stream. This is often referred to as &#x27;muxing.&#x27;

Generally, a demultiplexer is a device that transforms one multiplexed data stream into several. Satellite modems don&#x27;t have many outputs, so a &quot;demultiplexer&quot; here performs a drop operation, allowing to the modem to choose channels that will be transferred to the output.

A demultiplexer achieves this goal by maintaining &quot;frame synchronization&quot;.

== Applications ==
Satellite modems are often used for home internet access.

There are two different types, both employing the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard as their basis:
* One-way satmodems (DVB-IP modems) use a return channel not based on communication with the satellite, such as telephone or cable.
* Two-way satmodems (DVB-RCS modems, also called astromodems) employ a satellite-based return channel as well; they do not need another connection. DVB-RCS is ETSI standard EN 301 790.

There are also industrial satellite modems intended to provide a permanent link. They are used, for example, in the Steel shankar network.

<doc id="183243" wikidata="Q6185405" url="?curid=183243" title="Alluvium">
<text>Alluvium (, ) is loose clay, silt, sand, or gravel that has been deposited by running water in a stream bed, on a floodplain, in an alluvial fan or beach, or in similar settings. Alluvium is also sometimes called alluvial deposit. Alluvium is typically geologically young and is not consolidated into solid rock. Sediments deposited underwater, in seas, estuaries, lakes, or ponds, are not described as alluvium.
Floodplain alluvium can be highly fertile, and supported some of the earliest human civilizations.

==Definitions==
The present consensus is that &quot;alluvium&quot; refers to loose sediments of all types deposited by running water in floodplains or in alluvial fans or related landforms. However, the meaning of the term has varied considerably since it was first defined in the French dictionary of Antoine Furetière, posthumously published in 1690. Drawing upon concepts from Roman law, Furetière defined &quot;alluvion&quot; (the French term for alluvium) as new land formed by deposition of sediments along rivers and seas.

By the 19th century, the term had come to mean recent sediments deposited by rivers on top of older &quot;diluvium&quot;, which was similar in character but interpreted as sediments deposited by Noah&#x27;s flood. With the rejection by geologists of the concept of a primordial universal flood, the term &quot;diluvium&quot; fell into disfavor and was replaced with &quot;older alluvium&quot;. At the same time, the term &quot;alluvium&quot; came to mean all sediment deposits due to running water on plains. The definition gradually expanded to include deposits in estuaries, coasts, and young rock of marine and fluvial origin.

Alluvium and diluvium were grouped as &quot;colluvium&quot; in the late 19th century. &quot;Colluvium&quot; is now generally understood as sediments produced by gravity-driven transport on steep slopes. At the same time, the definition of &quot;alluvium&quot; has switched back to an emphasis on sediments deposited by river action. There continues to be disagreement over what other sediment deposits should be included under the term &quot;alluvium&quot;.

==Age==
Most alluvium is Quaternary in age and is often referred to as &quot;cover&quot; because these sediments obscure the underlying bedrock. Most sedimentary material that fills a basin (&quot;basin fill&quot;) that is not lithified is typically lumped together as &quot;alluvial&quot;. Alluvium of Pliocene age occurs, for example, in parts of Idaho. Alluvium of late Miocene age occurs, for example, in the valley of the San Joaquin River, California.

<text>Borken is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northwestern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany in the Münster region. Neighboring districts are Steinfurt, Coesfeld, Recklinghausen, Wesel, Cleves, Bentheim in the Lower Saxony and the Dutch provinces Gelderland and Overijssel. The two biggest cities are Bocholt and Gronau.

== History ==

During the era of the Holy Roman Empire the area was subordinate to the Prince-Bishopric of Münster for centuries. In 1803 the bishops lost this territory, and the short-lived Principality of Salm was founded. After the Napoleonic Wars the region became a part of the Prussian province of Westphalia in 1815. At that time the district was created, together with the district Ahaus. In 1923 the city Bocholt left the district and became a district-free city. In 1975 the district got its current size by incorporating the district Ahaus, the city Bocholt and small parts of the districts Rees, Recklinghausen and Coesfeld.

== Geography ==

The district is located in the western part of the &quot;Münsterland&quot;, a rather flat and rural area.

== Coat of arms ==
The colors of the coat of arms were chosen to be the same as those of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster, the long-time owner of the region. The three white anchors in the middle derive from the coat of arms of the &quot;Herrschaft Anholt&quot;. It is depicted three times to show the three main parts the district was created from – the old district Borken, the district Ahaus and the city Bocholt.

<text>Borken (, Westphalian: &quot;Buorken&quot;) is a town and the capital of the district of the same name, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Borken is situated 10 km east of the Dutch border. Borken station is the northern terminus on the remaining section of the Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck–Winterswijk railway.

==History==

The name comes from the German word &quot;Burg&quot; or &quot;Burk&quot; and gradually changed to &quot;Burke&quot;, then &quot;Burken&quot; and finally to &quot;Borken&quot;. Around the year 800 the village was being used by Charles The Great (Charlemagne) as a stopover place on his travels. In 1226 City rights were granted by Bishop Dietrich II of Isenberg-Limburg. Fortification of the city with walls and towers was first noted in 1391.

In the last years of the Holy Roman Empire (1803–06) it was the capital of the short-lived principality of Salm. From 1810 to 1814 it was part of the French Empire. In 1815 Borken came under the jurisdiction of the Prussian Province of Westphalia. At the same time it became the seat of government for the newly formed district or county of Borken (Kreis Borken). Between 1880 and 1905 the area experienced the building of railroad connections: (1880 Wanne-Borken-Winterswijk line, 1901 Empel-Bocholt-Borken and Borken-Burgsteinfurt, 1905 Borken-Coesfeld-Münster).

Near the end of World War II the historic center of the city was heavily destroyed. After the war, community rearrangements followed in 1969, including annexation of Gemen and other towns in the vicinity. Between 1975 and 1978 came the cleaning up and rebuilding of the southern part of the old city. There, buildings which had outlasted the destruction of the Second World War were finally demolished. In 2001 Borken celebrated its 775th anniversary.

<text>A nuclear isomer is a metastable state of an atomic nucleus, in which one or more nucleons (protons or neutrons) occupy excited state levels (higher energy levels). &quot;Metastable&quot; describes nuclei whose excited states have half-lives 100 to 1000 times longer than the half-lives of the excited nuclear states that decay with a &quot;prompt&quot; half life (ordinarily on the order of 10−12 seconds). The term &quot;metastable&quot; is usually restricted to isomers with half-lives of 10−9 seconds or longer. Some references recommend seconds to distinguish the metastable half life from the normal &quot;prompt&quot; gamma-emission half-life. Occasionally the half-lives are far longer than this and can last minutes, hours, or years. For example, the  nuclear isomer survives so long (at least years) that it has never been observed to decay spontaneously. The half-life of a nuclear isomer can even exceed that of the ground state of the same nuclide, as shown by as well as , , , ,  and multiple holmium isomers.

Sometimes, the gamma decay from a metastable state is referred to as isomeric transition, but this process typically resembles shorter-lived gamma decays in all external aspects with the exception of the long-lived nature of the meta-stable parent nuclear isomer. The longer lives of nuclear isomers&#x27; metastable states are often due to the larger degree of nuclear spin change which must be involved in their gamma emission to reach the ground state. This high spin change causes these decays to be forbidden transitions and delayed. Delays in emission are caused by low or high available decay energy.

The first nuclear isomer and decay-daughter system (uranium X2/uranium Z, now known as /) was discovered by Otto Hahn in 1921.

==Nuclei of nuclear isomers==
The nucleus of a nuclear isomer occupies a higher energy state than the non-excited nucleus existing in the ground state. In an excited state, one or more of the protons or neutrons in a nucleus occupy a nuclear orbital of higher energy than an available nuclear orbital. These states are analogous to excited states of electrons in atoms.

When excited atomic states decay, energy is released by fluorescence. In electronic transitions, this process usually involves emission of light near the visible range. The amount of energy released is related to bond-dissociation energy or ionization energy and is usually in the range of a few to few tens of eV per bond. However, a much stronger type of binding energy, the nuclear binding energy, is involved in nuclear processes. Due to this, most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission. For example, a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 keV of energy; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic X-rays.

Nuclear isomers have long half-lives because their gamma decay is &quot;forbidden&quot; from the large change in nuclear spin needed to emit a gamma ray. For example, has a spin of 9 and must gamma-decay to with a spin of 1. Similarly, has a spin of 1/2 and must gamma-decay to with a spin of 9/2.

While most metastable isomers decay through gamma-ray emission, they can also decay through internal conversion. During internal conversion, energy of nuclear de-excitation is not emitted as a gamma ray, but is instead used to accelerate one of the inner electrons of the atom. These excited electrons then leave at a high speed. This occurs because inner atomic electrons penetrate the nucleus where they are subject to the intense electric fields created when the protons of the nucleus re-arrange in a different way.

In nuclei that are far from stability in energy, even more decay modes are known.

After fission, several of the fission fragments that may be produced have a metastable isomeric state. These fragments are usually produced in a highly excited state, in terms of energy and angular momentum, and go through a prompt de-excitation. At the end of this process, the nuclei can populate both the ground and the isomeric states. If the half-life of the isomers is long enough, it is possible to measure their production rate and compare it to that of the ground state, calculating the so-called &quot;isomeric yield ratio&quot;.

==Metastable isomers==

Metastable isomers can be produced through nuclear fusion or other nuclear reactions. A nucleus produced this way generally starts its existence in an excited state that relaxes through the emission of one or more gamma rays or conversion electrons. Sometimes the de-excitation does not completely proceed rapidly to the nuclear ground state. This usually occurs as a spin isomer when the formation of an intermediate excited state has a spin far different from that of the ground state. Gamma-ray emission is hindered if the spin of the post-emission state differs greatly from that of the emitting state, especially if the excitation energy is low. The excited state in this situation is a good candidate to be metastable if there are no other states of intermediate spin with excitation energies less than that of the metastable state.

Metastable isomers of a particular isotope are usually designated with an &quot;m&quot;. This designation is placed after the mass number of the atom; for example, cobalt-58m1 is abbreviated , where 27 is the atomic number of cobalt. For isotopes with more than one metastable isomer, &quot;indices&quot; are placed after the designation, and the labeling becomes m1, m2, m3, and so on. Increasing indices, m1, m2, etc., correlate with increasing levels of excitation energy stored in each of the isomeric states (e.g., hafnium-178m2, or ).
A different kind of metastable nuclear state (isomer) is the fission isomer or shape isomer. Most actinide nuclei in their ground states are not spherical, but rather prolate spheroidal, with an axis of symmetry longer than the other axes, similar to an American football or rugby ball. This geometry can result in quantum-mechanical states where the distribution of protons and neutrons is so much further from spherical geometry that de-excitation to the nuclear ground state is strongly hindered. In general, these states either de-excite to the ground state far more slowly than a &quot;usual&quot; excited state, or they undergo spontaneous fission with half-lives of the order of nanoseconds or microseconds—a very short time, but many orders of magnitude longer than the half-life of a more usual nuclear excited state. Fission isomers may be denoted with a postscript or superscript &quot;f&quot; rather than &quot;m&quot;, so that a fission isomer, e.g. of plutonium-240, can be denoted as plutonium-240f or .

==Nearly stable isomers==
Most nuclear excited states are very unstable and &quot;immediately&quot; radiate away the extra energy after existing on the order of 10−12 seconds. As a result, the characterization &quot;nuclear isomer&quot; is usually applied only to configurations with half-lives of 10−9 seconds or longer. Quantum mechanics predicts that certain atomic species should possess isomers with unusually long lifetimes even by this stricter standard and have interesting properties. Some nuclear isomers are so long-lived that they are relatively stable and can be produced and observed in quantity.

The most stable nuclear isomer occurring in nature is , which is present in all tantalum samples at about 1 part in 8,300. Its half-life is theorized to be at least years, markedly longer than the age of the universe. The low excitation energy of the isomeric state causes both gamma de-excitation to the ground state (which itself is radioactive by beta decay, with a half-life of only 8 hours) and direct electron capture to hafnium or beta decay to tungsten to be suppressed due to spin mismatches. The origin of this isomer is mysterious, though it is believed to have been formed in supernovae (as are most other heavy elements). Were it to relax to its ground state, it would release a photon with a photon energy of 75 keV.

It was first reported in 1988 by C. B. Collins that theoretically can be forced to release its energy by weaker X-rays, although at that time this de-excitation mechanism had never been observed. However, the de-excitation of by resonant photo-excitation of intermediate high levels of this nucleus (&quot;E&quot; ≈ 1 MeV) was observed in 1999 by Belic and co-workers in the Stuttgart nuclear physics group.

 is another reasonably stable nuclear isomer. It possesses a half-life of 31 years and the highest excitation energy of any comparably long-lived isomer. One gram of pure contains approximately 1.33 gigajoules of energy, the equivalent of exploding about of TNT. In the natural decay of , the energy is released as gamma rays with a total energy of 2.45 MeV. As with , there are disputed reports that can be stimulated into releasing its energy. Due to this, the substance is being studied as a possible source for gamma-ray lasers. These reports indicate that the energy is released very quickly, so that can produce extremely high powers (on the order of exawatts). Other isomers have also been investigated as possible media for gamma-ray stimulated emission.

Holmium&#x27;s nuclear isomer  has a half-life of 1,200 years, which is nearly the longest half-life of any holmium radionuclide. Only , with a half-life of 4,570 years, is more stable.

 has a remarkably low-lying metastable isomer only above the ground state. This low energy produces &quot;gamma rays&quot; at a wavelength of , in the far ultraviolet, which allows for direct nuclear laser spectroscopy. Such ultra-precise spectroscopy, however, could not begin without a sufficiently precise initial estimate of the wavelength, something that was only achieved in 2024 after two decades of effort. The energy is so low that the ionization state of the atom affects its half-life. Neutral decays by internal conversion with a half-life of , but because the isomeric energy is less than thorium&#x27;s second ionization energy of , this channel is forbidden in thorium cations and decays by gamma emission with a half-life of . This conveniently moderate lifetime allows the development of a nuclear clock of unprecedented accuracy.

==High-spin suppression of decay==
The most common mechanism for suppression of gamma decay of excited nuclei, and thus the existence of a metastable isomer, is lack of a decay route for the excited state that will change nuclear angular momentum along any given direction by the most common amount of 1 quantum unit &quot;ħ&quot; in the spin angular momentum. This change is necessary to emit a gamma photon, which has a spin of 1 unit in this system. Integral changes of 2 and more units in angular momentum are possible, but the emitted photons carry off the additional angular momentum. Changes of more than 1 unit are known as forbidden transitions. Each additional unit of spin change larger than 1 that the emitted gamma ray must carry inhibits decay rate by about 5 orders of magnitude. The highest known spin change of 8 units occurs in the decay of 180mTa, which suppresses its decay by a factor of 1035 from that associated with 1 unit. Instead of a natural gamma-decay half-life of 10−12 seconds, it has yet to be observed to decay, and is believed to have a half-life on the order of at least 1025 seconds, or at least years.

Gamma emission is impossible when the nucleus begins in a zero-spin state, as such an emission would not conserve angular momentum.

==Applications==
Hafnium isomers (mainly 178m2Hf) have been considered as weapons that could be used to circumvent the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, since it is claimed that they can be induced to emit very strong gamma radiation. This claim is generally discounted. DARPA had a program to investigate this use of both nuclear isomers. The potential to trigger an abrupt release of energy from nuclear isotopes, a prerequisite to their use in such weapons, is disputed. Nonetheless a 12-member Hafnium Isomer Production Panel (HIPP) was created in 2003 to assess means of mass-producing the isotope.

Technetium isomers  (with a half-life of 6.01 hours) and (with a half-life of 61 days) are used in medical and industrial applications.

===Nuclear batteries===

Nuclear batteries use small amounts (milligrams and microcuries) of radioisotopes with high energy densities. In one betavoltaic device design, radioactive material sits atop a device with adjacent layers of P-type and N-type silicon. Ionizing radiation directly penetrates the junction and creates electron–hole pairs. Nuclear isomers could replace other isotopes, and with further development, it may be possible to turn them on and off by triggering decay as needed. Current candidates for such use include 108Ag, 166Ho, 177Lu, and 242Am. As of 2004, the only successfully triggered isomer was 180mTa, which required more photon energy to trigger than was released.

An isotope such as 177Lu releases gamma rays by decay through a series of internal energy levels within the nucleus, and it is thought that by learning the triggering cross sections with sufficient accuracy, it may be possible to create energy stores that are 106 times more concentrated than high explosive or other traditional chemical energy storage.

==Decay processes==
An isomeric transition or internal transition (IT) is the decay of a nuclear isomer to a lower-energy nuclear state. The actual process has two types (modes):
* γ (gamma ray) emission (emission of a high-energy photon),
* internal conversion (the energy is used to eject one of the atom&#x27;s electrons).
Isomers may decay into other elements, though the rate of decay may differ between isomers. For example, 177mLu can beta-decay to 177Hf with a half-life of 160.4 d, or it can undergo isomeric transition to 177Lu with a half-life of 160.4 d, which then beta-decays to 177Hf with a half-life of 6.68 d.

The emission of a gamma ray from an excited nuclear state allows the nucleus to lose energy and reach a lower-energy state, sometimes its ground state. In certain cases, the excited nuclear state following a nuclear reaction or other type of radioactive decay can become a metastable nuclear excited state. Some nuclei are able to stay in this metastable excited state for minutes, hours, days, or occasionally far longer.

The process of isomeric transition is similar to gamma emission from any excited nuclear state, but differs by involving excited metastable states of nuclei with longer half-lives. As with other excited states, the nucleus can be left in an isomeric state following the emission of an alpha particle, beta particle, or some other type of particle.

The gamma ray may transfer its energy directly to one of the most tightly bound electrons, causing that electron to be ejected from the atom, a process termed the photoelectric effect. This should not be confused with the internal conversion process, in which no gamma-ray photon is produced as an intermediate particle.

<text>Albert Bitzius (4 October 179722 October 1854) was a Swiss novelist, best known by his pen name of Jeremias Gotthelf.

==Biography==
Bitzius was born at Murten, where his father was pastor. The Bitzius family had once belonged to the Bernese patriciate, but was known for its craftsmen and pastors since the 17th century. In 1804, the family home was moved to Utzenstorf, a village in the Bernese Emmental. Here young Bitzius grew up, receiving his early education and consorting with the boys of the village, as well as helping his father to cultivate his glebe. In 1812 he went to complete his education at Bern. He was a founding member of the Student Society Zofingia, the second-oldest fraternity in Switzerland (founded in 1819).

In 1820 he was received as a pastor. In 1821 he enrolled for a year at the University of Göttingen, but returned home in 1822 to act as his father&#x27;s assistant. On his father&#x27;s death (1824) he went in the same capacity to Herzogenbuchsee, and later to Bern (1829). Early in 1831 he went as assistant to the aged pastor of the village of Lützelflüh, in the Lower Emmental (between Langnau and Burgdorf), being soon elected his successor (1832) and marrying one of his granddaughters, Henriette Zeender (1833).

He spent the rest of his life in Lützelflüh, where he died, leaving three children (the son was a pastor, the two daughters married pastors). 
During the 1840s, he steadfastly opposed radicalism and secularism and placed a conservative emphasis on piety and ecclesiastical authority. There are lives of Bitzius by C. Manuel, in the Berlin edition of Bitzius&#x27;s works (Berlin, 1861), and by J. Ammann in vol. i. (Bern, 1884) of the &quot;Sammlung Bernischer Biographien&quot;.

==Writings==
Bitzius started writing late in life. His first work, the &quot;Der Bauernspiegel, oder die Lebensgeschichte des Jeremias Gotthelf&quot;, appeared in 1837. It purported to be the life of Jeremias Gotthelf, narrated by himself, and this name was later adopted by the author as his pen name. It sketches the development of a poor country orphan boy, but is not an autobiography. It is a living picture of Bernese (or, strictly speaking, Emmental) village life, true to nature, and not attempting to gloss over its defects and failings. It is written (like the rest of his works) in German, but contains expressions from the Bernese dialect of the Emmental, though Bitzius was not (like Auerbach) a peasant by birth, but belonged to the educated classes, so that he reproduces what he had seen and learnt, and not what he had himself personally experienced. The book was a great success, as it was a picture of real life, and not of fancifully beribboned eighteenth-century villagers. Henceforth Bitzius was a prolific writer, and in the last 18 years of his life became one of the important novelists not only of Switzerland but of the German language in general.
His best-known work is without doubt the short novel &quot;The Black Spider&quot; (&quot;Die schwarze Spinne&quot;), a semi-allegorical tale of the plague in form of the titular monster that devastates a Swiss valley community; first as a result of a pact with the devil born out of need and a second time due to the moral decay that releases the monster from its prison again.

Among his later tales are the &quot;Leiden und Freuden eines Schulmeisters&quot; (1838–1839), &quot;Uli der Knecht&quot; (The story of a poor peasant laborer who develops into the owner of a prosperous farm; 1841), with its continuation, &quot;Uli der Pächter&quot; (1849), &quot;Anne-Bäbi Jowäger&quot; (1843–1844), &quot;Käthi, die Großmutter&quot; (1846), &quot;Die Käserei in der Vehfreude&quot; (1850), and the &quot;Erlebnisse eines Schuldenbauers&quot; (1853). He also published several volumes of shorter tales.

His works were issued in 24 volumes at Berlin, between 1856 and 1861, while 10 volumes, giving the original text of each story, were issued at Bern between 1898 and 1900.

==Cultural references==

===Literature===
In &quot;The Tongue Set Free&quot;, the first part of the autobiography of Elias Canetti, the author mentions being haunted by Gotthelf&#x27;s short story &#x27;The Black Spider&#x27; in his early teens.

In the novel &quot;2666&quot; by Roberto Bolaño Gotthelf is mentioned as the subject of the novel &quot;Bitzius&quot;:
(...) and in &quot;Bitzius&quot;, a novel less than one hundred pages long, similar in some ways to &quot;Mitzi&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, (...) and that told the story of the life of Albert Bitzius, pastor of Lützelflüh, in the canton of Bern, an author of sermons as well as a writer under the pseudonym Jeremias Gotthelf.

<text>Dating creation is the attempt to provide an estimate of the age of Earth or the age of the universe as understood through the creation myths of various religious traditions. Various traditional beliefs hold that the Earth, or the entire universe, was brought into being in a grand creation event by one or more deities. After these cultures develop calendars, a question arises: Precisely how long ago did this creation event happen?

== Sumerian and Babylonian ==
One of the Old Babylonian versions of the ancient Sumerian King List (WB 444) lists various mythical antediluvian kings and gives them reigns of several tens of thousands of years. The first Sumerian king Alulim, at Eridu, is described as reigning for 28,800 years, followed by several later kings of similar periods. In total these antediluvian kings ruled for 241,200 years from the time when &quot;the kingship was lowered from heaven&quot; to the time when &quot;the flood&quot; swept over the land. However, most modern scholars do not believe the ancient Sumerians or Babylonians believed in a chronology of their own this old. Instead they believed that these figures were either fabrications, or were based on not literal solar years (365.2425 days) but instead lunar months (29.53059 days).

Cicero, reacting to the chronologies of such authors as Berossos (who composed a Greek-language history of Babylonia, known as the &quot;Babyloniaca&quot;, during the 3rd century BC), strongly criticised the claim that the Babylonians had kings going back hundreds of thousands of years:

Diodorus Siculus also wrote something similar about how he believed the Babylonians fabricated their chronology:

Despite these criticisms, some ancient Greeks, including most notably Alexander Polyhistor and Proclus, believed the Babylonian kings were hundreds of thousands of years old, and that the Babylonians dated their creation 400,000–200,000 years before their own time.

==Egyptian==
The ancient Turin King List lists a mythical predynastic &quot;reign of the gods&quot; which first occurred 36,620 years before Menes (3050 BC), therefore dating the creation to around 39,670 BC.

Fragments from Manetho (Eusebius, George Syncellus and preserved in Felix Jacoby&#x27;s &quot;FGrH&quot;), however, list different dates. Eusebius, regarding Aegyptiaca, in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; recorded that:

Using these times, 13,900 + 1,255 + 1,817 + 1,790 + 350 + 5,813 = 24,950 years, which counting back from Menes (3050 BC) fixes the creation at 28,000 BC. George Syncellus preserved yet another set of figures for the predynastic &quot;reign of the gods&quot;, 11,984 years for Gods and 2,646 for demigods producing 14,630 years, thus dating the creation to 17,680 BC.

The &quot;Book of Sothis&quot;, considered as Pseudo-Manetho by many scholars, provides different figures. One fragment from Pseudo-Manetho dates the reign of the first Egyptian God (Ptah) 36,525 years before Menes (FGrH, #610 F2) and so dates the creation to about 39,575 BC.

The ancient Greeks reported similar figures on ancient Egyptian chronology. Diogenes Laërtius recorded that the ancient Egyptians dated their creation to their first god Hephaestus, who by &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot; was Ptah. According to Laertius, Hephaestus (Ptah) lived 48,863 years before Alexander the Great (b. 356 BC), dating the creation to 49,219 BC. Herodotus wrote that the ancient Egyptians had gods who ruled over them before the first dynasty of Egypt, but did not attempt to precisely date their creation by using their chronology:

According to Herodotus the ancient Egyptian demigods began 11,340 years before the reign of Seti I (1290 BC), so 11,340 + 1290 = 12,630 BC, while he listed earlier figures, 15,000 and 17,000, for the reign of the gods.

The ancient Greek writer Diodorus Siculus wrote that the ancient Egyptians dated their creation (or start of their reign of Gods) &quot;a little less than eighteen thousand years&quot; from Ptolemy XII Auletes (117–51 BC).

Apollonius, an Egyptian pagan priest in the 2nd century AD, calculated the cosmos to be 153,075 years old as reported by Theophilus of Antioch.

Martianus Capella, a pagan writer, wrote in his &quot;De nuptiis&quot; in the 5th century AD that the ancient Egyptians had archives of astronomy which started 40,000 years before his own era.

Herodotus&#x27; figures were discussed by Isaac Newton in his &quot;The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended&quot; (1728) but were dismissed by Newton because they did not fit Christian cosmology.

The mathematician and esotericist R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, in his work &quot;Sacred Science&quot;, reconstructed Herodotus&#x27; dates to conclude that the ancient Egyptians dated their creation to an astronomical (stellar) event some 30,000 years before Herodotus&#x27; own time.

==Hinduism==

The &quot;Rig Veda&quot; questions the origin of the cosmos in the Nasadiya Sukta (the 129th hymn of Rigveda 10th mandala):
Dick Teresi in his book &quot;Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science&quot;, reviewing Vedas writes that:
Carl Sagan and Fritjof Capra have pointed out similarities between the latest scientific understanding of the age of the universe and the Hindu concept of a &quot;day and night of Brahma&quot;, which is much closer to the current known age of the universe than other creation views. The days and nights of Brahma posit a view of the universe that is divinely created, and is not strictly evolutionary, but an ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the universe. According to Sagan:
Also, as per Hinduism, Kaliyuga, the last part of the current cycle (yuga cycle) of time traditionally starts in 3102 BC.

==Greek and Roman==
Most ancient Greek and Roman chroniclers, poets, grammarians, and scholars (Eratosthenes, Varro, Apollodorus of Athens, Ovid, Censorinus, Catullus, and Castor of Rhodes) believed in a threefold division of history: &quot;ádelon&quot; (obscure), &quot;mythikón&quot; (mythical) and &quot;historikón&quot; (historical) periods. According to the Roman grammarian Censorinus, the first period of &quot;ádelon&quot; (obscure), was calculated by Varro as follows:

The primordial &quot;ádelon&quot; (obscure) period &quot;ended&quot; with the flood of Ogyges and what followed was the beginning of the &quot;mythikón&quot; (mythical) period. Varro dated this flood to 2137 BC but Censorinus wrote in his &quot;De Die Natali&quot; ch. xxi that the Ogyges’ diluvium occurred 1600 years before the first Olympiad (776 BC) meaning 2376 BC. Castor of Rhodes also provided another date for the start of the &quot;mythikón&quot; (mythical) period, 2123 BC. Censorinus recorded that the second period, the &quot;mythikón&quot;, stretched from the flood of Ogyges to the first Olympiad:

Censorinus quoted Varro in saying the second period (&quot;mythikón&quot;) lasted from 2137 to 776 BC, or if Censorinus&#x27; own dates are used: 2376 BC to 776 BC, or finally if Castor&#x27;s: 2123 BC to 776 BC. Ovid, however, dated the start of the &quot;mythikón&quot; period to the reign of Inachus, whom he dated 400 or so years &quot;after&quot; the flood of Ogyges, meaning around 1900–1700 BC, but agreed with Varro that the &quot;mythikón&quot; ended during the first Olympiad (776 BC). See Ages of Man for more details about Ovid&#x27;s chronology. Another ancient date for the start of the &quot;mythikón&quot; (mythical) period is found preserved in Augustine&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot; xviii.3, which dates it to 2050 BC. The final period according to Censorinus and Varro, the &quot;historikón&quot; (historical) era, began from 776 BC (the first Olympiad) to their own time:

Eratosthenes and Apollodorus of Athens, however, pushed back the start of the historical period to the Trojan War, which they fixed at 1184 BC.

Very few ancient Greeks or Romans attempted to date the creation, or beginning of the &quot;ádelon&quot; (obscure) period. While all ancient sources (excluding Ovid) dated the &quot;end&quot; of this period and start of the mythical (&quot;mythikón&quot;) period to 2376–2050 BC, most did not claim to know when the creation (&quot;ádelon&quot; period) exactly began. As Censorinus admitted:

Varro and Castor of Rhodes also wrote something very similar; however, some ancient Greeks and Romans attempted to calculate the date for the creation by using ancient sources or records of mythological figures. Since Inachus was dated 400 years after the flood of Ogyges and that Ogyges himself was considered a Titan or a primordial Autochthon &quot;from earliest ages&quot;, some ancient Greeks or Romans dated the creation (beginning with Chaos or Gaia) only a few hundred years before Ogyges (2376–2050 BC). Most ancient Greeks, however, did not subscribe to such a literalist view of using mythology to attempt to date the creation; Hecataeus of Miletus was an early ancient Greek logographer who strongly criticised this method, while Ptolemy wrote of such an &quot;immense period&quot; of time before the historical period (776 BC), and thus believed in a much greater age for the creation.

Among the ancient Greek and Roman philosophers there were different opinions and traditions pertaining to the date of the creation. Some philosophers believed the Universe was eternal, and actually had no date of creation.

==Zoroastrianism==
Zoroastrianism involves a 12,000-year cosmogony and chronology, often divided into four ages as outlined in the &quot;Bundahishn&quot;. The first age lasted for 3,000 years and included the &quot;spiritual&quot; creation by Ahura Mazda, followed by the &quot;physical&quot; creation of 3,000 years when evil entered the world (see Angra Mainyu). During the 6,000th year, Zoroaster&#x27;s Fravashi was created, followed by the prophet Zoroaster himself at the end of the 9th millennium. The 9,000th year marked the start of the fourth and last age. Modern Zoroastrians believe they are living currently in the final age. Since evil first entered the physical creation after the spiritual creation was complete, Zoroastrians maintain that for 9,000 years the world continues to be a battlefield between Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu, which will end during the 12,000th year, when the Saoshyants brings about the final renovation of the world to defeat evil.

Dating precisely the beginning of the start of the 12,000th year cosmogony rests solely on the date Zoroaster is estimated to have been born. Since Zoroaster was born himself at the end of the 9th millennium (just before the 9,000th year), the date of creation can be calculated by counting back 8,900–9,000 years. The Persian Zoroastrian tradition places Zoroaster around the 7th or 6th century BC, since the &quot;Bundahishn&quot; (34. 1-9) and the &quot;Book of Arda Viraf&quot; dates Zoroaster 258 years before the era of Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) which dates Zoroaster from 614-581 BC. The 11th century Persian Muslim scholar Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī also dated Zoroaster 258 years before the era of Alexander (&quot;The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries&quot;, p. 17, l. 10, transl. Sachau). This date is also found in the historical account &quot;The Meadows of Gold&quot; (iv.107) written by the 9th-century Arab historian Al-Masudi. Other Arabic, Persian and Muslim sources place Zoroaster around the same date (600 BC). Therefore, if 8,900-9,000 years are added to about 600 BC the date of creation comes to 9600 - 9500 BC. A 12,000 year chronology places the end date at around 2400-2500 AD, which is why modern Zoroastrians believe they are living in the end few hundred years of the final era. Other dates for Zoroaster, however, differ and dates proposed for Zoroaster&#x27;s birth range from 1750 to 500 BC.

==Chinese==
The ancient Chinese historian Xu Zheng () in his &quot;Three Five Historic Records&quot; dated the creation of the world by Pangu 36,000 years (2 x 18,000) before the reign of the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The date of the &quot;Three sovereigns&quot; is fixed at 3000–2700 BC and therefore dates the creation about 39,000 BC.

==Maya==
The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar dates the creation of the world of human beings to 11 August 3114 BC (in the most commonly accepted correlation) according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar, or Monday, 6 September 3114 BC according to the proleptic Julian calendar. There was also a previous creation that did not have a beginning date, but a date on Stela F from Quiriguá refers to a date possibly 24 trillion years in the past.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Genesis creation narrative===

Within the biblical framework and chronology, various dates have been proposed for the date of creation since ancient times, to more recent periods. The Bible begins with the Book of Genesis, in which God creates the Earth, the rest of the Universe, and the Earth&#x27;s plants and animals, including the first humans, in six days. A second narrative begins with the first human pair, Adam and Eve, and goes on to list many of their descendants, in many cases giving the ages at which they had children and died. If these events and ages are interpreted literally throughout and the genealogies are considered closed, it is possible to build up a chronology in which many of the events of the Old Testament are dated to an estimated number of years after creation. Some biblical scholars have gone further, attempting to harmonise this biblical chronology with that of recorded history, thus establishing a date for creation in a modern calendar. Since the biblical story lacks chronology for some periods, the duration of events has been subject to interpretation in many different ways, resulting in a variety of estimates of the date of creation.

Numerous efforts have been made to determine the biblical date of creation, yielding varying results. Besides differences in interpretation, the use of different versions of the Bible can also affect the result. Two dominant dates for creation using such models exist, about 5500 BC and about 4000 BC. These were calculated from the genealogies in two versions of the Bible, with most of the difference arising from two versions of Genesis. The older dates stem from the Greek Septuagint. The later dates are based on the Hebrew Masoretic Text. The patriarchs from Adam to Terah, the father of Abraham, were often 100 years older when they begat their named son in the Septuagint than they were in the Hebrew or the Vulgate (Genesis 5, 11). The net difference between the two genealogies of Genesis amounts to 1466 years (ignoring the &quot;second year after the flood&quot; ambiguity), which accounts for virtually all of the 1500-year difference between 5500 BC and 4000 BC. For example, the period from the creation to the Flood derives from the genealogical table of the ten patriarchs listed in , and , called the generations of Adam. According to the Masoretic Text, this period consists of 1,656 years, and Western Christian Bibles deriving from the Latin Vulgate also follow this dating. However, the Samaritan texts give an equivalent period of 1,307 years, and according to the Septuagint (Codex Alexandrinus, Elizabeth Bible) it is 2,262 years. James Ussher agrees with the dating until the birth of Abraham, which he argues took place when Terah was 130, and not 70 as is the direct reading of , thus adding 60 years to his chronology for events postdating Abraham.

===Early Jewish estimations===
The earliest post-exilic Jewish chronicle preserved in the Hebrew language, the &quot;Seder Olam Rabbah&quot;, compiled by Jose ben Halafta in 160 AD, dates the creation of the world to 3761 BC while the later &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot; to 4339 BC. The Hebrew calendar has traditionally, since the 4th century AD by Hillel II, dated the creation to 3761 BC.

===Septuagint===
Many of the earliest Christians who used the Septuagint version of the Bible calculated creation as having occurred about 5500 BC, and Christians up to the Middle Ages continued to use this rough estimate: Clement of Alexandria (5592 BC), Theophilus of Antioch (5529 BC), Sextus Julius Africanus (5501 BC), Hippolytus of Rome (5500 BC), Panodorus of Alexandria (5493 BC), Maximus the Confessor (5493 BC), George Syncellus (5492 BC), Sulpicius Severus (5469 BC), Isidore of Seville (5336 BC) and Gregory of Tours (5200 BC). The Byzantine calendar has traditionally dated the creation of the world to September 1, 5509 BC.

The &quot;Chronicon of Eusebius&quot; (early 4th century) dated creation to 5228 BC while Jerome (c. 380, Constantinople) dated creation to 5199 BC. In the &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot;, the Proclamation of the Birth of Christ formerly used this date, as did the Irish &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;.

Bede was one of the first to break away from the standard Septuagint date for the creation and in his work &quot;De Temporibus&quot; (&quot;On Time&quot;) (completed in 703 AD) dated the creation to 18 March 3952 BC but was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfrid, because his chronology was contrary to accepted calculations of around 5500 BC.

===Masoretic===
After the Masoretic Text was published, however, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and was received with wide support. Proposed calculations of the date of creation using the Masoretic from the 10th century to the 18th century include: Marianus Scotus (4192 BC), Henry Fynes Clinton (4138 BC), Henri Spondanus (4051 BC), Benedict Pereira (4021 BC), Louis Cappel (4005 BC), James Ussher (4004 BC), Augustin Calmet (4002 BC), Isaac Newton (3998 BC), Petavius (3984 BC), Theodore Bibliander (3980 BC), Johannes Kepler (April 27, 3977 BC) [based on his book &quot;Mysterium Cosmographicum&quot;], Heinrich Bünting (3967 BC), Christen Sørensen Longomontanus (3966 BC), Melanchthon (3964 BC), Martin Luther (3961 BC), Cornelius Cornelii a Lapide (3961 BC), John Lightfoot (3960 BC), Joseph Justus Scaliger (3949 BC), Christoph Helvig (3947 BC), Gerardus Mercator (3928 BC), Matthieu Brouard (3927 BC), Benito Arias Montano (3849 BC), Andreas Helwig (3836 BC).

Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation only the Archbishop Ussher chronology dates the creation to 4004 BC and became the most accepted and popular, mainly because this specific date was attached to the King James Bible.

Polish Christmas carol &quot;Wśród nocnej ciszy&quot; contains text &quot;Cztery tysiące lat wyglądany&quot; (&quot;Looked out for four thousand years&quot;) related to Jesus, which also corresponds to date of creation based on Masoretic Text.

===Alfonsine tables===
Alfonso X of Castile commissioned the Alfonsine tables, composed of astronomical data based on observation, from which the date of the creation has been calculated to be either 6984 BC or 6484 BC.

===Other biblical estimations===
In 1738, said he had collected over 200 different estimates, ranging from 3483 BC to 6984 BC. John Clark Ridpath attributes these values respectively to Yom-Tov Lipmann-Muhlhausen and Regiomontanus.

* Christian Charles Josias Bunsen in the 19th century dated the creation to 20,000 BC.
* Tarleton Perry Crawford dated the creation to 12,500 BC.
* Harold Camping dated the creation to 11,013 BC.

<text>Coesfeld () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northwestern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, west of the city of Münster. Neighboring districts are Steinfurt, district-free Münster, Warendorf, district-free Hamm, Unna, Recklinghausen, Borken.

== History ==
In medieval times the region was subordinate to the bishopric of Münster. When the area became part of the Prussian province Westphalia in 1816 the new administration created two districts, Coesfeld and Lüdinghausen. Except minor changes they stayed until the major reorganization in 1975 when both were merged to form the current district. A few municipalities from the district Münster were also added, while others formerly belonging to the district were moved to neighboring districts.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the &quot;Münsterland&quot;, a mostly rural area. The Lippe River forms part of the border of the district in the south.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms depicts a bishop, a goose and a bell. The bishop is Saint Liudger, the first bishop of Münster. The goose was according to a popular legend thrown into a dry well by Liudger, in order to find water during a drought. The bells of Lüdinghausen allegedly chimed by themselves, whenever Liudger entered the town. The left side derives from the former coat of arms of the district Lüdinghausen, while the right side comes from the old district Coesfeld. The coat of arms were granted in 1979.

<text>John Sculley III (born April 6, 1939) is an American businessman, entrepreneur and investor in high-tech startups. Sculley was vice-president (1970–1977) and president of PepsiCo (1977–1983), until he became chief executive officer (CEO) of Apple Inc. on April 8, 1983, a position he held until leaving on October 15, 1993. In 1987, Sculley was named Silicon Valley&#x27;s top-paid executive, with an annual salary of US$10.2 million.

During Sculley&#x27;s tenure at Apple, the company&#x27;s sales increased tenfold from $800 million to $8 billion, while the period between 1989 and 1991 was regarded as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of Macintosh. Some attribute his success to the fact that he joined the company just when co-founders Steve Jobs&#x27;s visions and Steve Wozniak&#x27;s creations had become highly lucrative. Jobs and Sculley &quot;clashed over management styles and priorities, Jobs focusing on future innovation and Sculley more on current product lines and profitability&quot;. Sculley won a power struggle leading to Jobs&#x27;s ouster, and departed from Jobs&#x27;s sales structure, instead deciding to compete with IBM in selling computers to the same types of customers. This strategy was initially successful due to the launch of fresh new Macintosh models for different segments which generated increasing profits. By the early 1990s, profits declined due to increasing competition from less expensive IBM PC compatibles running Windows 3.0. Sculley ultimately was forced to step down as Apple CEO because he was opposed to licensing Macintosh software and was talking to Goldman Sachs about splitting Apple into two companies. When Sculley left in May 1993, Apple had $2 billion in cash and $200 million in debt.

Sculley is recognized as an expert in marketing, in part because of his early successes at PepsiCo, notably his introduction of the Pepsi Challenge, which allowed the company to gain market share from primary rival Coca-Cola. He used similar marketing strategies throughout the 1980s and 1990s at Apple to mass-market Macintosh personal computers, and today he continues to speak and write about disruptive marketing strategies. In more recent times, Sculley has invested in and has been involved with a number of high-tech start-up companies, and as of 2016 serves as Chairman of the PeopleTicker and SkillsVillage.

== Early life ==
Sculley was born in New York City, the son of Margaret Blackburn (Smith), a horticulturist, and John Sculley Jr., a Wall Street lawyer. Sculley and his brothers spent much of their childhood in Bermuda before moving back to New York. He attended high school at St. Mark&#x27;s School in Southborough, Massachusetts.

Sculley received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Architectural Design from Brown University and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

== Career ==
Sculley began work at Marschalk Co. in New York City in 1963.

=== 1967–82: Pepsi-Cola ===
Sculley joined the Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo in 1967 as a trainee, where he participated in a six-month training program at a bottling plant in Pittsburgh. In 1970, at the age of 30, Sculley became the company&#x27;s youngest marketing vice-president.

Sculley initiated one of the company&#x27;s first consumer-research studies, an extended in-home product test in which 350 families participated. As a result of the research, Pepsi decided to launch new, larger, and more varied packages of their soft drinks, including the two-liter bottle Sculley worked with DuPont to develop. In 1970, Pepsi set out to dethrone Coca-Cola as the market leader of the industry, in what eventually became known as the Cola Wars. Pepsi began spending more on marketing and advertising, typically paying between US$200,000 and $300,000 for each television spot, while most companies spent between $15,000 and $75,000. With the Pepsi Generation campaign, Pepsi aimed to overturn Coca-Cola&#x27;s classic marketing.

In 1974, Sculley became president of PepsiCo&#x27;s International Food Operations division, shortly after he visited a failing potato-chip factory in Paris. PepsiCo&#x27;s food division was their only money-losing division, with revenues of US$83 million and losses of $156.5 million. To make the food division profitable, Sculley improved product quality, enhanced accounts, and established financial controls. Within three years, the food division was making US$300 million in revenues and $40 million in profit.

Sculley was best known at Pepsi for the Pepsi Challenge, an advertising campaign he started in 1975 to compete against Coca-Cola to gain market share, using heavily advertised taste tests. It claimed based on Sculley&#x27;s own research that Pepsi-Cola tasted better than Coca-Cola. The Pepsi Challenge included a series of television advertisements that first aired in the early 1970s, featuring lifelong Coca-Cola drinkers participating in blind taste tests. Pepsi&#x27;s soft drink was always chosen as the preferred product by the participant; however, these results have been criticized as being caused by Pepsi&#x27;s sweetness, rather than its superior taste.

The Pepsi Challenge was mostly targeted at the Texas market, where Pepsi had a significantly lower market share at the time. The campaign was successful, significantly increasing Pepsi&#x27;s market share in that state. At the time the Pepsi Challenge was started, Sculley was senior vice-president of United States sales and marketing operations at Pepsi. Sculley himself took the taste test and picked Coke instead of Pepsi.

In 1977, Sculley was named Pepsi&#x27;s youngest-ever president. Although commonly called the CEO of Pepsi, this was never the case. At the time of his departure, Don Kendall was CEO of Pepsi.

=== 1983–93: Apple Computer, Inc. ===

Apple lured Sculley away from Pepsi in order to apply his marketing skills to the personal computer market. Steve Jobs successfully sealed the deal after he made his pitch to Sculley: &quot;Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?&quot; Apple&#x27;s president, Mike Markkula, wanted to retire and believed that Jobs, who wished to be the company&#x27;s president, lacked the discipline and temperament needed to run Apple on a daily basis. Sculley, with his solid business background and recent success, would give Apple an image of greater reliability and stability. In an interview with Authority Magazine, Sculley said that Jobs came to him and said &quot;How did you do that? You had no money to speak of at Pepsi. “How did you pass Coca Cola?” And I responded, “Well, we call it experience marketing.” The focus was on selling the experience, not the product.

When Sculley started at Apple, he got a $1 million signing bonus, $1 million in annual pay and options on 350,000 Apple shares. From the time Jobs and Sculley first met in 1982 until 1985, they had what they both acknowledged as an amazing partnership. Sculley used his marketing experience to help keep the aging Apple II, generating much-needed cash, and helped Jobs launch the Mac with the most admired consumer marketing campaign of its time. Once Jobs took over the Macintosh project from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and early Apple employee Jef Raskin, he became the executive product manager and made all the product decisions.

The Lisa computer, an innovative model designed by a team initially led by Jobs, became available in January 1983, and had disastrous sales. When Jobs&#x27;s Macintosh, the first of a new series of models with a pioneering black-and-white graphical user interface, was shipped to stores in January 1984, Sculley raised the initial price to $2,495 from the originally planned $1,995, allocating the additional money to hypothetically higher profit margins and to expensive advertising campaigns. Macintosh sold well, and received excellent reviews, but it did not eliminate the IBM PC.

At the peak of the Macintosh success, Apple made an attempt to move unsold inventory of Lisa computers by renaming it to &quot;Macintosh XL&quot; and positioning it as a top-of-the-line pro Macintosh model. At this point, a power struggle between Jobs and Sculley was becoming obvious. Jobs became &quot;non-linear&quot;: he kept meetings running past midnight, sent out lengthy faxes, then called new meetings at 7:00 am. Sculley had little control over the Macintosh division where Jobs was the general manager.

The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to &quot;contain&quot; Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley&#x27;s direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out about Jobs&#x27;s plans and called a board meeting at which Apple&#x27;s board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties. Jobs resigned from Apple and founded NeXT Inc. the same year. Sculley said in 2015 that Jobs never forgave him and their friendship was never repaired.

After Jobs left, Sculley was named president and the company experienced a turnaround in 1986; one journalist wrote &quot;since Sculley joined the company … many things have changed&quot;, and that his &quot;strategy has worked&quot;. Wozniak credited the Macintosh&#x27;s initial success to Sculley, saying that he &quot;worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away&quot;. Under the direction of Sculley, who had learned several painful lessons after introducing the bulky Macintosh Portable in 1989, Apple introduced the PowerBook in 1991.

In 1991, Apple introduced System 7, a major upgrade to the operating system, which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for Mac OS until 2001, when the classic Mac OS was replaced by Mac OS X. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue. For some time, it appeared that Apple could do no wrong, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine &quot;MacAddict&quot; named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh. Under the leadership of Sculley, Apple&#x27;s sales multiplied from $982 million in 1983 to $7.9 billion in 1993.

Microsoft threatened to discontinue Microsoft Office for the Macintosh if Apple did not license parts of the Macintosh graphical user interface to use in the Windows operating system. Under pressure, Sculley agreed, a decision which later affected the &quot;Apple v. Microsoft&quot; lawsuit. About that time, Sculley coined the term personal digital assistant (PDA) referring to the Apple Newton, one of the world&#x27;s first PDAs, a product that Sculley oversaw and launched in 1993.

In 1987, Sculley made several predictions in a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview: He predicted that the Soviet Union would land a man on Mars within the next 20 years and he claimed that optical storage media such as the CD-ROM would revolutionize the use of personal computers. Some of his ideas for the Knowledge Navigator were eventually fulfilled by the Internet and the World Wide Web during the 1990s and others by Apple itself with the introduction of Siri.

On December 5, 1992, Sculley, as chairman, CEO, and CTO of Apple Computer, Inc., gave a seminal speech regarding the future of the Internet, titled &quot;The Dawn of a $3.5 Trillion Communications Mega-Industry: Information Access, Processing and Distribution in a Digital World.&quot; This was the keynote address to a packed house at the Harvard Business School&#x27;s Burden Auditorium, as part of the inaugural student-run Harvard/MIT Communications 2000 Symposium, now known as the Harvard Business School Tech Club&#x27;s annual Cyberposium.

In the early 1990s, Sculley led Apple to port its operating system to run on a new microprocessor, the PowerPC. Sculley later acknowledged such an act was his greatest mistake, indicating that he should instead have targeted the dominant Intel architecture. After a bad first quarter in 1993, amid a personal-computer price war and internal tension over the company&#x27;s direction, Apple&#x27;s board forced Sculley out. He resigned on October 15, 1993 and was replaced by German-born Michael Spindler, who had been Chief Operating Officer. Spindler was ousted three years later and replaced with Gil Amelio. In 1997, amidst poor financial performance Apple would acquire Steve Jobs&#x27;s NeXT Software; Jobs would oust Amelio and reinstate himself as chief executive.

=== 1993–present: tech investment ===
After leaving Apple on October 23, 1993, Sculley became chairman and chief executive officer at Spectrum Information Technologies, a New York-based company that held key computer patents for wireless data transmission. Only four months later he resigned from the company and filed a lawsuit against Spectrum president Peter Caserta, seeking more than $10 million in damages. Sculley alleged that he was misled when he was hired at Spectrum by not being told of SEC inquiries and &quot;aggressive revenue recognition accounting&quot; for license fees.

Sculley has been a founding investor in MetroPCS (formerly General Wireless) and helped guide the company&#x27;s brand marketing; MetroPCS became a multibillion-dollar public company on the New York Stock Exchange until its acquisition by T-Mobile in 2013. He built NFO Research from $25 million to $550 million in revenue, and sold it to IPG for $850 million. He helped launch and advised Hotwire.com, Intralinks (which was co-founded by his brother Arthur), and InPhonic, Buy.com, and PeoplePC.

In 1997, Sculley became the chairman of Live Picture, a California-based company, to oversee its push into high-quality, low-bandwidth imaging over the Internet. US$22M in venture capital was provided for the company. Sculley later left the company, but remained an investor. In 1999, Live Picture filed for federal bankruptcy protection as part of a plan to be acquired by MGI Software.

In 1997, Sculley co-founded PopTech with Bob Metcalfe and several other dignitaries from the technology industry. In 1998, he joined the board of directors of BuyComp LLC (now Buy.com), an Internet-only computer store. Two years later, he partnered with Dennis M. Lynch to launch Signature21, providing marketing services to small to medium-sized businesses. In 2001, Sculley and Lynch transitioned the company into a learning program for rising entrepreneurs. Months later, Lynch left the company, while Sculley continued to consult and work with small businesses, including InPhonic, whose board of directors he later joined. InPhonic was an online retailer of cell phones and wireless plans. Sculley&#x27;s early leadership helped steer InPhonic towards its successful IPO in 2004. Sculley served as the vice chairman of the InPhonic board of directors. InPhonic filed for bankruptcy in 2007.

In 2002, Sculley endorsed and invested in the Wine Clip, a wine accessory product, which claims to accelerate the aeration of wine by exposure to magnets. A year later he helped in the founding of Verified Person Inc., an online pre-employment screening company. As of 2012, he serves on the board of directors. In 2004, Sculley joined the board of directors at OpenPeak, a maker of software for wireless consumer electronics, digital media, computers, and home systems. In the same year, Sculley became a venture partner at Rho Ventures. In March 2006, Sculley was named Chairman of IdenTrust (formerly Digital Signature Trust Company) a San Francisco-based firm focusing on verifying identity and boosting financial security.

Before speaking at the Silicon Valley 4.0 conference, Sculley was interviewed by CNET in October 2003, where he explained the mistakes he made at Apple concerning the Apple Newton and HyperCard. Sculley had canceled Apple&#x27;s first hand-held mobile tablet PenMac led by Paul Mercer with applications by Samir Arora and instead signed an agreement to work with Sharp Electronics on the Newton technology. Also in 2003, Sculley was interviewed by the BBC for the television documentary &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Powerful&quot; episode &quot;Steve Jobs vs. Bill Gates&quot;, discussing his time at Apple during the 1980s as CEO. In 2010, he was interviewed for &quot;Cult of Mac&quot; on the topics of Steve Jobs and design.

In 2007, Sculley co-founded the data company Zeta Global with business partner David A. Steinberg, and in January 2014 the data analytics firm XL Marketing, rebranded and incorporated its resources into Zeta Interactive, re-launching it as a Big Data-Driven Marketing firm. On January 30, 2014, Sculley was a panelist at a forum organized by Zeta, which featured ad executives, marketers and NFL executive to discuss the changes in the way companies market and reach consumers since Sculley&#x27;s time at Apple in 1984 when the computer company featured what became one of the first iconic Super Bowl ads—the 1984 commercial. In October 2016, Zeta Interactive was again rebranded as Zeta Global.

In 2014, Sculley co-founded Obi Mobiles, a smartphone brand aimed at the emerging markets. The company was renamed Obi Worldphone. In September 2017, Sculley distanced himself from Obi Worldphone and told that his name was used for PR only. He has also been working in the health care industry, focusing on RxAdvance, a cloud-based platform that helps pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and insurers manage chronically ill patients living at home.

== Other ==
Sculley went political in the early 1990s on behalf of Republican Tom Campbell, who in 1992 was running in the California Republican primary to be the party candidate for a United States Senate seat. Sculley hosted a fundraiser for Campbell at his ranch in Woodside. Sculley had become acquainted with Hillary Clinton, serving with her on a national education council. When Bill Clinton ran for president, Sculley supported him. Sculley sat next to Hillary Clinton during the President&#x27;s first State of the Union address in January 1993.

=== In the media ===
Sculley was portrayed by Allan Royal in the 1999 TNT television film &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;, by Matthew Modine in the 2013 film &quot;Jobs&quot; and by Jeff Daniels in the 2015 film &quot;Steve Jobs&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Sculley married Ruth, stepdaughter of PepsiCo president Donald Kendall in 1960, with whom he had two children. The couple divorced in 1965. In 1978, he married Carol Lee Adams, ex-wife of a former PepsiCo vice president, ultimately divorcing in 2011.

In 2013, Sculley married Diane Gibbs Poli, vice president and design coordinator for Wittman Building Corporation, and they live in Palm Beach, Florida.

In 2016, while visiting Japan, Sculley saw Steve Jobs&#x27;s autograph in a sushi restaurant, and broke down in tears. The owner said: “He told me that since they were retired from the frontlines of business, they could have enjoyed sushi at Steve’s favorite restaurant and had a good time together, but he has passed away and now he’s in heaven.”

<text>James Pradier (born Jean-Jacques Pradier, ; 23 May 1790 – 4 June 1852) was a Genevan-born French sculptor best known for his work in the neoclassical style.

==Life and work==
Born in Geneva (then the Republic of Geneva), Pradier was the son of a Protestant family from Toulouse. He left for Paris in 1807 to work with his elder brother, Charles-Simon Pradier, an engraver, and also attended the École des Beaux-Arts beginning in 1808. He won a Prix de Rome that enabled him to study in Rome from 1814 to 1818 at the Villa Medici. Pradier made his debut at the Salon of 1819 and quickly acquired a reputation as a competent artist. He studied under Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres in Paris. In 1827 he became a member of the &quot;Académie des beaux-arts&quot; and a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Pradier oversaw the finishing of his sculptures himself. He was a friend of the Romantic poets Alfred de Musset, Victor Hugo, Théophile Gautier, and the young Gustave Flaubert. His workshop was a meeting place for artists, presided over by his mistress, Juliette Drouet, who became Victor Hugo&#x27;s mistress in 1833. After the liaison with Drouet ended, Pradier married Louise d&#x27;Arcet (1814-1885), daughter of the French chemist Jean-Pierre-Joseph d&#x27;Arcet, in 1833. They separated in 1845, after Pradier had become aware of her infidelities. They had three children: Charlotte (born 27 July 1834), John (b. 21 May 1836), and Thérèse (b. 3 July 1839). Due to her numerous lovers and her complicated financial lfe, Louise Pradier was among the inspirations for Flaubert when he wrote &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;.



The cool neoclassical surface finish of Pradier&#x27;s sculptures is charged with an eroticism that their mythological themes can barely disguise. At the Salon of 1834, Pradier&#x27;s &quot;Satyr and Bacchante&quot; created a scandalous sensation. Some claimed to recognize the features of the sculptor and his mistress, Juliette Drouet. When the prudish government of Louis-Philippe refused to purchase it, Count (later Prince) Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov bought it and took it to his palazzo in Florencethough many years later it would finally be on display in France, part of the Louvre&#x27;s collection.

Other famous sculptures by Pradier are the figures of Fame in the spandrels of the Arc de Triomphe, decorative figures at the Madeleine, and his twelve &quot;Victories&quot; inside the dome of the Invalides, all in Paris. For his native Geneva he completed the statue of the Genevan Jean-Jacques Rousseau erected in 1838 on the tiny Île Rousseau, where Lac Léman empties to form the Rhône. Aside from large-scale sculptures, Pradier collaborated with François-Désiré Froment-Meurice, designing jewelry in a &#x27;Renaissance-Romantic&#x27; style.

James Pradier is buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery. Much of the contents of his studio were bought after his death by the city museum of Geneva.

==Influence==
Pradier&#x27;s importance as an artist in his day is demonstrated by the fact that his portrait is included in François Joseph Heim&#x27;s painting &quot;Charles X Distributing Prizes to Artists at the Salon of 1824&quot;, now in the Louvre Museum, Paris.

Pradier has been largely forgotten in modern times. In 1846 Gustave Flaubert said of him, however:
:&quot;This is a great artist, a true Greek, the most antique of all the moderns; a man who is distracted by nothing, not by politics, nor socialism, and who, like a true workman, sleeves rolled up, is there to do his task from morning until night with the will to do well and the love of his art.&quot;

An exhibition, &quot;Statues de chair: sculptures de James Pradier (1790–1852)&quot; at Geneva&#x27;s Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire (October 1985 – February 1986) and Paris, Musée du Luxembourg (February – May 1986), roused some interest in Pradier&#x27;s career and aesthetic.

<doc id="183275" wikidata="Q5421354" url="?curid=183275" title="Exploratory engineering">
<text>Exploratory engineering is a term coined by K. Eric Drexler to describe the process of designing and analyzing detailed hypothetical models of systems that are not feasible with current technologies or methods, but do seem to be clearly within the bounds of what science considers to be possible within the narrowly defined scope of operation of the hypothetical system model. It usually results in paper or video prototypes, or (more likely nowadays) computer simulations that are as convincing as possible to those that know the relevant science, given the lack of experimental confirmation. By analogy with protoscience, it might be considered a form of protoengineering.

==Usage==

Due to the difficulty and necessity of anticipating results in such areas as genetic modification, climate change, molecular engineering, and megascale engineering, parallel fields such as bioethics, climate engineering and hypothetical molecular nanotechnology sometimes emerge to develop and examine hypotheses, define limits, and express potential solutions to the anticipated technological problems. Proponents of exploratory engineering contend that it is an appropriate initial approach to such problems.

Engineering is concerned with the design of a solution to a practical problem. A scientist may ask &quot;why?&quot; and proceed to research the answer to the question. By contrast, engineers want to know how to solve a problem, and how to implement that solution. Exploratory engineering often posits that a highly detailed solution exists, and explores the putative characteristics of such a solution, while holding in abeyance the question of how to implement that solution. If a point can be reached where the attempted implementation of the solution is addressed using the principles of engineering physics, the activity transitions from protoengineering to actual engineering, and results in success or failure to implement the design.

==Requirements==

Unlike the scientific method which relies on peer reviewed experiments which attempt to prove or disprove a falsifiable hypothesis, exploratory engineering relies on peer review, simulation and other methods employed by scientists, but applies them to some hypothetical artifact, a specific and detailed hypothesized design or process, rather than to an abstract model or theory. Because of the inherent lack of experimental falsifiability in exploratory engineering, its practitioners must take particular care to avoid falling into practices analogous to cargo cult science, pseudoscience, and pathological science.

==Criticism==

Exploratory engineering has its critics, who dismiss the activity as mere armchair speculation, albeit with computer assist. A boundary which would take exploratory engineering out of the realm of mere speculation and define it as a realistic design activity is often indiscernible to such critics, and at the same time is often inexpressible by the proponents of exploratory engineering. While both critics and proponents often agree that much of the highly detailed simulation effort in the field may never result in a physical device, the dichotomy between the two groups is exemplified by the situation in which proponents of molecular nanotechnology contend that many complicated molecular machinery designs will be realizable after an unspecified &quot;assembler breakthrough&quot; envisioned by K. Eric Drexler, while critics contend that this attitude embodies wishful thinking equivalent to that in the famous Sidney Harris cartoon () &quot;And then a miracle occurs&quot; published in the American Scientist magazine. In summary the critics contend that a hypothetical model which is both self-consistent and consistent with the laws of science concerning its operation, in the absence of a path to build the device modeled, provides no evidence that the desired device can be built. Proponents contend that there are so many potential ways to build the desired device that surely at least one of those ways will not display a critical flaw preventing the device from being built.

==Science fiction==

Both proponents and critics often point to science fiction stories as the origin of exploratory engineering. On the positive side of the science fiction ledger, the ocean-going submarine, the telecommunications satellite, and other inventions were anticipated in such stories before they could be built. On the negative side of the same ledger, other science fiction devices such as the space elevator may be forever impossible because of basic strength of materials issues or due to other difficulties, either anticipated or unanticipated.

<doc id="183280" wikidata="Q14378" url="?curid=183280" title="Neoclassicism">
<text>Neoclassicism, also spelled Neo-classicism, emerged as a Western cultural movement in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that drew inspiration from the art and culture of classical antiquity. Neoclassicism was born in Rome, largely due to the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann during the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Its popularity expanded throughout Europe as a generation of European art students finished their Grand Tour and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals. The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, eventually competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style endured throughout the 19th, 20th, and into the 21st century.

European Neoclassicism in the visual arts began in opposition to the then-dominant Rococo style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, and drawn directly from 16th-century Renaissance Classicism. Each &quot;neo&quot;-classicism movement selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. Between 1765 and 1830, Neoclassical proponents—writers, speakers, patrons, collectors, artists and sculptors—paid homage to an &quot;idea&quot; of the artistic generation associated with Phidias, but sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of late antiquity. The discovery of ancient Palmyra&#x27;s &quot;Rococo&quot; art through engravings in Robert Wood&#x27;s &quot;The Ruins of Palmyra&quot; came as a revelation. With Greece largely unexplored and considered a dangerous territory of the Ottoman Empire, Neoclassicists&#x27; appreciation of Greek architecture was predominantly mediated through drawings and engravings which were subtly smoothed and regularized, &quot;corrected&quot; and &quot;restored&quot; monuments of Greece, not always consciously.

The Empire style, a second phase of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts, had its cultural centre in Paris in the Napoleonic era. Especially in architecture, but also in other fields, Neoclassicism remained a force long after the early 19th century, with periodic waves of revivalism into the 20th and even the 21st centuries, especially in the United States and Russia.

==History==
Neoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period, which coincided and reflected the developments in philosophy and other areas of the Age of Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding Rococo style. While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of Romanticism, this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, Ingres, demonstrates this especially well. The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.

The writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books &quot;Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture&quot; (1750) and &quot;Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums&quot; (&quot;History of Ancient Art&quot;, 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at &quot;noble simplicity and calm grandeur&quot;, and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find &quot;not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of Plato teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone&quot;. The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: &quot;The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients&quot;.

The Industrial Revolution saw global transition of human economy towards more efficient and stable manufacturing processes. There was tremendous material advancement and increased prosperity. With the advent of the Grand Tour, a fad of collecting antiquities began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe. &quot;Neoclassicism&quot; in each art implies a particular canon of a &quot;classical&quot; model.

In English, the term &quot;Neoclassicism&quot; is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in English literature, which began considerably earlier, is called Augustan literature. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of classical music, and &quot;Neoclassicism&quot; is used of 20th-century developments. However, the operas of Christoph Willibald Gluck represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of &quot;Alceste&quot; (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing ornamentation, increasing the role of the chorus in line with Greek tragedy, and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.

The term &quot;Neoclassical&quot; was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as &quot;the true style&quot;, &quot;reformed&quot; and &quot;revival&quot;; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the Renaissance, and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble Baroque of the age of Louis XIV, for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France&#x27;s dominant military and political position started a serious decline. Ingres&#x27;s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique consular diptychs and their Carolingian revival, to the disapproval of critics.

Neoclassicism was strongest in architecture, sculpture and the decorative arts, where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann&#x27;s writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at Pompeii and Herculaneum and, like most contemporaries except for Gavin Hamilton, was unimpressed by them, citing Pliny the Younger&#x27;s comments on the decline of painting in his period.

As for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of Raphael&#x27;s generation, frescos in Nero&#x27;s &quot;Domus Aurea&quot;, Pompeii and Herculaneum, and through renewed admiration of Nicolas Poussin. Much &quot;Neoclassical&quot; painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally being on the winning side.

==Painting, drawing and printmaking==
It is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as &quot;insipid&quot; and &quot;almost entirely uninteresting to us&quot;—some of Kenneth Clark&#x27;s comments on Anton Raphael Mengs&#x27; ambitious &quot;Parnassus&quot; at the Villa Albani, by the artist whom his friend Winckelmann described as &quot;the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times&quot;. The drawings, subsequently turned into prints, of John Flaxman used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium) and figures mostly in profile to depict &quot;The Odyssey&quot; and other subjects, and once &quot;fired the artistic youth of Europe&quot; but are now &quot;neglected&quot;, while the history paintings of Angelica Kauffman, mainly a portraitist, are described as having &quot;an unctuous softness and tediousness&quot; by Fritz Novotny. Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the Greek vases used by Flaxman, Raphael tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended.

The work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements. The German-Danish painter Asmus Jacob Carstens finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann&#x27;s prescription of &quot;noble simplicity and calm grandeur&quot;. Unlike Carstens&#x27; unrealized schemes, the etchings of Giovanni Battista Piranesi were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the Grand Tour to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his &quot;Vedute&quot; (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of &quot;Carceri d&#x27;invenzione&quot; (&quot;Imaginary Prisons&quot;) whose &quot;oppressive cyclopean architecture&quot; conveys &quot;dreams of fear and frustration&quot;. The Swiss-born Henry Fuseli spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the &quot;Gothic&quot; strain of Romanticism, and sought to evoke drama and excitement.

Neoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s &quot;Oath of the Horatii&quot; at the Paris Salon of 1785. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a frieze, with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of opera, and the classical colouring of Nicolas Poussin. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the French Revolution became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the Napoleonic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the Bourbon Restoration.

David&#x27;s many students included Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into Orientalism and the Troubadour style that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of Impressionism, but his style, once formed, changed little.

==Sculpture==

If Neoclassical painting suffered from a lack of ancient models, Neoclassical sculpture tended to suffer from an excess of them. Although examples of actual Greek sculpture of the &quot;Classical Period&quot; beginning in about 500 BC were then very few; the most highly regarded works were mostly Roman copies. The leading Neoclassical sculptors enjoyed huge reputations in their own day, but are now less regarded, with the exception of Jean-Antoine Houdon, whose work was mainly portraits, very often as busts, which do not sacrifice a strong impression of the sitter&#x27;s personality to idealism. His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the notable figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a statue of George Washington, as well as busts of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and other founders of the new republic.

Antonio Canova and the Dane Bertel Thorvaldsen were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the &quot;Three Graces&quot;. All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.

An early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede Johan Tobias Sergel. John Flaxman was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for Josiah Wedgwood for several years. Johann Gottfried Schadow and his son Rudolph, one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists, with Franz Anton von Zauner in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor Franz Xaver Messerschmidt turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive &quot;character heads&quot; of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions. Like Piranesi&#x27;s &quot;Carceri&quot;, these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of psychoanalysis in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor Mathieu Kessels studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.

Since prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads, the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of Horatio Greenough, Harriet Hosmer, Hiram Powers, Randolph Rogers and William Henry Rinehart.

==Architecture and the decorative arts==


Neoclassical art was traditional and new, historical and modern, conservative and progressive all at the same time.

Neoclassicism first gained influence in Britain and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden, Poland and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for Catherine the Great&#x27;s lover, Count Grigory Orlov, designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian &quot;stuccadori&quot;: only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the bas-relief overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.

A second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of engravings) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the Napoleonic Empire. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the &quot;Louis XVI style&quot;, and the second in the styles called &quot;Directoire&quot; and Empire. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.

In the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in Biedermeier furniture made in Austria; in Karl Friedrich Schinkel&#x27;s museums in Berlin, Sir John Soane&#x27;s Bank of England in London and the newly built &quot;United States Capitol&quot; in Washington, D.C.; and in Josiah Wedgwood&#x27;s bas reliefs and &quot;black basaltes&quot; vases. The style was international; Scots architect Charles Cameron created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born Catherine the Great, in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Indoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of &quot;Le Antichità di Ercolano&quot; (&quot;The Antiquities of Herculaneum&quot;). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the Baroque, or the most &quot;Roman&quot; rooms of William Kent were based on basilica and temple exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: pedimented window frames turned into gilded mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary.

Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low frieze-like relief or painted in monotones &quot;en camaïeu&quot; (&quot;like cameos&quot;), isolated medallions or vases or busts or &quot;bucrania&quot; or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of &quot;Pompeiian red&quot; or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the &quot;Goût grec&quot; (&quot;Greek style&quot;), not a court style; when Louis XVI acceded to the throne in 1774, Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, brought the Louis XVI style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: &quot;Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another&quot;.
From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the Greek Revival. At the same time the Empire style was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of Napoleon in the First French Empire, where it was intended to idealize Napoleon&#x27;s leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States, the Regency style in Britain, and the &quot;Napoleon style&quot; in Sweden. According to the art historian Hugh Honour &quot;so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neoclassical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces&quot;. An earlier phase of the style was called the Adam style in Great Britain.

Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in academic art through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to Romanticism or Gothic revivals —, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles. The centres of several European cities, notably Saint Petersburg and Munich, came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.

Gothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, &quot;romantic&quot; appearance.

=== France ===
==== Louis XVI style (1760–1789) ====

It marks the transition from Rococo to Classicism. Unlike the Classicism of Louis XIV, which transformed ornaments into symbols, Louis XVI style represents them as realistic and natural as possible, i.e. laurel branches really are laurel branches, roses the same, and so on. One of the main decorative principles is symmetry. In interiors, the colours used are very bright, including white, light grey, bright blue, pink, yellow, very light lilac, and gold. Excesses of ornamentation are avoided. The return to antiquity is synonymous with above all with a return to the straight lines: strict verticals and horizontals were the order of the day. Serpentine ones were no longer tolerated, save for the occasional half circle or oval. Interior decor also honored this taste for rigor, with the result that flat surfaces and right angles returned to fashion. Ornament was used to mediate this severity, but it never interfered with basic lines and always was disposed symmetrically around a central axis. Even so, &quot;ébénistes&quot; often canted fore-angles to avoid excessive rigidity.

The decorative motifs of Louis XVI style were inspired by antiquity, the Louis XIV style, and nature. Characteristic elements of the style: a torch crossed with a sheath with arrows, imbricated disks, guilloché, double bow-knots, smoking braziers, linear repetitions of small motifs (rosettes, beads, oves), trophy or floral medallions hanging from a knotted ribbon, acanthus leaves, gadrooning, interlace, meanders, cornucopias, mascarons, Ancient urns, tripods, perfume burners, dolphins, ram and lion heads, chimeras, and gryphons. Greco-Roman architectural motifs are also heavily used: flutings, pilasters (fluted and unfluted), fluted balusters (twisted and straight), columns (engaged and unengaged, sometimes replaced by caryathids), volute corbels, triglyphs with guttae (in relief and trompe-l&#x27;œil).

==== Directoire style (1789–1804) ====


====Empire style (1804–1815) ====


Neoclassicism was representative for the new French society that exited the revolution, setting the tone in all life fields, including art. The Jacquard machine was invented during this period (which revolutionised the entire sewing system, manual until then). One of the dominant colours was red, decorated with gilt bronze. Bright colours were also used, including white, cream, violet, brown, blue, dark red, with little ornaments of gilt bronze. Interior architecture included wood panels decorated with gilt reliefs (on a white background or a coloured one). Motifs were placed geometrically. The walls were covered in stuccos, wallpaper fabrics. Fireplace mantels were made of white marble, having caryatids at their corners, or other elements: obelisks, sphinxes, winged lions, and so on. Bronze objects were placed on their tops, including mantel clocks. The doors consisted of simple rectangular panels, decorated with a Pompeian-inspired central figure. Empire fabrics are damasks with a blue or brown background, satins with a green, pink or purple background, velvets of the same colors, brooches broached with gold or silver, and cotton fabrics. All of these were used in interiors for curtains, for covering certain furniture, for cushions or upholstery (leather was also used for upholstery).

All Empire ornament is governed by a rigorous spirit of symmetry reminiscent of the Louis XIV style. Generally, the motifs on a piece&#x27;s right and left sides correspond to one another in every detail; when they do not, the individual motifs themselves are entirely symmetrical in composition: antique heads with identical tresses falling onto each shoulder, frontal figures of Victory with symmetrically arrayed tunics, identical rosettes or swans flanking a lock plate, etc. Like Louis XIV, Napoleon had a set of emblems unmistakably associated with his rule, most notably the eagle, the bee, stars, and the initials I (for &quot;Imperator&quot;) and N (for &quot;Napoleon&quot;), which were usually inscribed within an imperial laurel crown. Motifs used include: figures of Victory bearing palm branches, Greek dancers, nude and draped women, figures of antique chariots, winged putti, mascarons of Apollo, Hermes and the Gorgon, swans, lions, the heads of oxen, horses and wild beasts, butterflies, claws, winged chimeras, sphinxes, bucrania, sea horses, oak wreaths knotted by thin trailing ribbons, climbing grape vines, poppy rinceaux, rosettes, palm branches, and laurel. There&#x27;s a lot of Greco-Roman ones: stiff and flat acanthus leaves, palmettes, cornucopias, beads, amphoras, tripods, imbricated disks, caduceuses of Mercury, vases, helmets, burning torches, winged trumpet players, and ancient musical instruments (tubas, rattles and especially lyres). Despite their antique derivation, the fluting and triglyphs so prevalent under Louis XVI are abandoned. Egyptian Revival motifs are especially common at the beginning of the period: scarabs, lotus capitals, winged disks, obelisks, pyramids, figures wearing nemeses, caryatids &quot;en gaine&quot; supported by bare feet and with women Egyptian headdresses.

=== Germany ===

Neoclassical architecture became widespread as a symbol of wealth and power in Germany, mostly in what was then Prussia. Karl Friedrich Schinkel built many prominent buildings in this style, including the Altes Museum in Berlin. While the city remained dominated by Baroque city planning, his architecture and functional style provided the city with a distinctly neoclassical center.

His Bauakademie is considered one of the forerunners of modern architecture due to its hithertofore relatively streamlined façade of the building

=== Italy ===

From the second half of the 18th century through the 19th century, Italy went through a great deal of socio-economic changes, several foreign invasions and the turbulent Risorgimento, which resulted in Italian unification in 1861. Thus, Italian art went through a series of minor and major changes in style.

Italian Neoclassicism was the earliest manifestation of the general period known as Neoclassicism and lasted more than the other national variants of neoclassicism. It developed in opposition to the Baroque style around and lasted until . Neoclassicism began around the period of the rediscovery of Pompeii and spread all over Europe as a generation of art students returned to their countries from the Grand Tour in Italy with rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals. It first centred in Rome where artists such as Antonio Canova and Jacques-Louis David were active in the second half of the 18th century, before moving to Paris. Painters of Vedute, like Canaletto and Giovanni Paolo Panini, also enjoyed a huge success during the Grand Tour. Neoclassical architecture was inspired by the Renaissance works of Andrea Palladio and saw in Luigi Vanvitelli the main interpreters of the style.

Classicist literature had a great impact on the Risorgimento movement: the main figures of the period include Vittorio Alfieri, Giuseppe Parini, Vincenzo Monti and Ugo Foscolo, Giacomo Leopardi and Alessandro Manzoni (nephew of Cesare Beccaria), who were also influenced by the French Enlightenment and German Romanticism. The virtuoso violinist Paganini and the operas of Rossini, Donnizetti, Bellini and, later, Verdi dominated the scene in Italian classical and romantic music.

The art of Francesco Hayez and especially that of the Macchiaioli represented a break with the classical school, which came to an end as Italy unified (see Italian modern and contemporary art). Neoclassicism was the last Italian-born style, after the Renaissance and Baroque, to spread to all Western Art.

===Romania===
During the 19th century, the predominant style in Wallachia and Moldavia, later the Kingdom of Romania, was Classicism which lasted for a long time, until the 20th century, although it coexisted in some short periods with other styles. Foreign architects and engineers were invited here since the first decade of the 19th century. Most of the architects that built during the beginning of the century were foreigners because Romanians did not have yet the instruction needed for designing buildings that were very different compared to the Romanian tradition. Usually using Classicism, they started building together with Romanian artisans, usually prepared in foreign schools or academies. Romanian architects studied in Western European schools as well. One example is Alexandru Orăscu, one of the representatives of Neoclassicism in Romania.

Classicism manifested both in religious and secular architecture. A good example of secular architecture is the Știrbei Palace on Calea Victoriei (Bucharest), built around the year 1835, after the plans of French architect Michel Sanjouand. It received a new level in 1882, designed by Austrian architect Joseph Hartmann

=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===

In 1905–1914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of Neoclassical revival; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of Alexandrine period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-Renaissance, Palladian and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like Ivan Fomin, Vladimir Shchuko and Ivan Zholtovsky. When the economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily modernist environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, Ilya Golosov) developed their own modernized styles.

With the crackdown on architect&#x27;s independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the Palace of Soviets, Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in Stalinist architecture, although not the only choice. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of Boris Iofan, bordering with contemporary Art Deco (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for constructivist leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.

Neoclassicism was an easy choice for the Soviet Union since it did not rely on modern construction technologies (steel frame or reinforced concrete) and could be reproduced in traditional masonry. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material rationing. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including &quot;exported&quot; architecture of Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw and the Shanghai International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when Nikita Khrushchev put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.

===United Kingdom===

The Adam style was created by two brothers, Adam and James, who published in 1777 a volume of etchings with interior ornamentation. In the interior decoration made after Robert Adam&#x27;s drawings, the walls, ceilings, doors, and any other surface, are divided into big panels: rectangular, round, square, with stuccos and Greco-Roman motifs at the edges. Ornaments used include festoons, pearls, egg-and-dart bands, medallions, and any other motifs used during the Classical antiquity (especially the Etruscan ones). Decorative fittings such as urn-shaped stone vases, gilded silverware, lamps, and stauettes all have the same source of inspiration, classical antiquity. The Adam style emphasizes refined rectangular mirrors, framed like paintings (in frames with stylised leafs), or with a pediment above them, supporting an urn or a medallion. Another design of Adam mirrors is shaped like a Venetian window, with a big central mirror between two other thinner and longer ones. Another type of mirrors are the oval ones, usually decorated with festoons. The furniture in this style has a similar structure to Louis XVI furniture.

Besides the Adam style, when it comes to decorative arts, England is also known for the ceramic manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood (1730–1795), who established a pottery called Etruria. Wedgwood ware is made of a material called jasperware, a hard and fine-grained type of stoneware. Wedgwood vases are usually decorated with reliefs in two colours, in most cases the figures being white and the background blue.

===United States===

On the American continent, architecture and interior decoration have been highly influenced by the styles developed in Europe. The French taste has highly marked its presence in the southern states (after the French Revolution some emigrants have moved here, and in Canada a big part of the population has French origins). The practical spirit and the material situation of the Americans at that time gave the interiors a typic atmosphere. All the American furniture, carpets, tableware, ceramic, and silverware, with all the European influences, and sometimes Islamic, Turkish or Asian, were made in conformity with the American norms, taste, and functional requirements. There have existed in the US a period of the Queen Anne style, and an Chippendale one. A style of its own, the Federal style, has developed completely in the 18th and early 19th centuries, which has flourished being influenced by Britannic taste. Under the impulse of Neoclassicism, architecture, interiors, and furniture have been created. The style, although it has numerous characteristics which differ from state to state, is unitary. The structures of architecture, interiors, and furniture are Classicist, and incorporate Baroque and Rococo influences. The shapes used include rectangles, ovals, and crescents. Stucco or wooden panels on walls and ceilings reproduce Classicist motifs. Furniture tend to be decorated with floral marquetry and bronze or brass inlays (sometimes gilded).

==Gardens==
In England, Augustan literature had a direct parallel with the Augustan style of landscape design. The links are clearly seen in the work of Alexander Pope. The best surviving examples of Neoclassical English gardens are Chiswick House, Stowe House and Stourhead.

==Fashion==

In fashion, Neoclassicism influenced the much greater simplicity of women&#x27;s dresses, and the long-lasting fashion for white, from well before the French Revolution, but it was not until after it that thorough-going attempts to imitate ancient styles became fashionable in France, at least for women. Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model Emma, Lady Hamilton from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and masquerade balls until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by Juliette Récamier, Joséphine de Beauharnais, Thérésa Tallien and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, Talleyrand quipped that: &quot;Il n&#x27;est pas possible de s&#x27;exposer plus somptueusement!&quot; (&quot;One could not be more sumptuously undressed&quot;). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics. Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, bonnets or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.

Very light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the Empire silhouette although it predates the First French Empire of Napoleon, but his first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured. By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.

Neoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter&#x27;s or, especially, the sculptor&#x27;s studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or pantaloon, over the &quot;culotte&quot; or knee-breeches of the Ancien Régime. Even when David designed a new French &quot;national costume&quot; at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the French Revolutionary Wars, and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced civilian male styles.

The trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary history paintings; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various stratagems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In &quot;James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of Palmyra&quot; (1758) by Gavin Hamilton, the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in toga-like Arab robes. In &quot;Watson and the Shark&quot; (1778) by John Singleton Copley, the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single breeched leg prominently. However the Americans Copley and Benjamin West led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West&#x27;s &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; (1770) and Copley&#x27;s &quot;The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781&quot; (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;, completed in 1819.

Classically inspired male hairstyles included the Bedford Crop, arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford as a protest against a tax on hair powder; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French &quot;coiffure à la Titus&quot; after Titus Junius Brutus (not in fact the Roman Emperor Titus as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both Napoleon and George IV of the United Kingdom. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor François-Joseph Talma, who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Brutus&quot; (about Lucius Junius Brutus, who orders the execution of his son Titus). In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs, and the style was also worn by women, the reporting in 1802 that &quot;more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig &quot;à la Titus&quot;.

==Music==
Neoclassicism in music is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the Classical and Baroque musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of Impressionism in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed &quot;classical&quot; dancing and costume in ballet and physical education.

The 17th–18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before World War I but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. Ottorino Respighi&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Airs and Dances&quot; (1917) led the way for the sort of sound to which the Neoclassicists aspired. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. Igor Stravinsky is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like Octet for Wind Instruments (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is Prokofiev&#x27;s Classical Symphony No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of Haydn or Mozart. Neoclassical ballet as innovated by George Balanchine de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.

==Later Neoclassicism and continuations==
After the middle of the 19th century, Neoclassicism starts to no longer be the main style, being replaced by Eclecticism of Classical styles. The Palais Garnier in Paris is a good example of this, since despite being predominantly Neoclassical, it features elements and ornaments taken from Baroque and Renaissance architecture. This practice was frequent in late 19th and early 20th century architecture, before World War I. Besides Neoclassicism, the well known for this eclecticism of Classical styles.

Pablo Picasso experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following World War I.

In American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the American Renaissance movement, &quot;ca.&quot; 1890–1917; its last manifestation was in Beaux-Arts architecture, and its final large public projects were the Lincoln Memorial (highly criticized at the time), the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir Edwin Lutyens&#x27; monumental city planning for New Delhi marks the sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) a mythical time.

There was an entire 20th-century movement in the non-visual arts which was also called Neoclassicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see 20th-century classical music and Neoclassicism in music. For information on the philosophical aspects, see Great Books.)

This literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) Dada, in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in English literature were laid by T. E. Hulme, the most famous Neoclassicists were T. S. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of Acmeism, with Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelshtam as the leading representatives.

===Art Deco===

Although it started to be seen as &#x27;dated&#x27; after WW1, principles, proportions and other Neoclassical elements were not abandoned yet. Art Deco was the dominant style during the interwar period, and it corresponds with the taste of a bourgeois elite for high class French styles of the past, including the Louis XVI, Directoire and Empire (the period styles of French Neoclassicism). At the same time, the French elite was equally capable of appreciating Modern art, like the works of Pablo Picasso or Amedeo Modigliani. The result of this situation is the early Art Deco style, which uses both new and old elements. The Palais de Tokyo from 1937 in Paris, by André Aubert and Marcel Dastugue, is a good example of this. Although ornaments are not used here, the facade being decorated only with reliefs, the way columns are present here is a strong reminiscence of Neoclassicism. Art Deco design often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky commodes by Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann or Louis Süe &amp; André Mare; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of Isadora Duncan. Conservative modernist architects such as Auguste Perret in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings.

The oscillation of Art Deco between the use of historic elements, shapes and proportions, and the appetite for &#x27;new&#x27;, for Modernism, is the result of multiple factors. One of them is eclecticism. The complexity and heterogeneity of Art Deco is largely due to the eclectic spirit. Stylized elements from repertoire of Beaux-Arts, Neoclassicism, or of cultures distant in time and space (Ancient Egypt, Pre-Columbian Americas, or Sub-Saharian African art) are put together with references to Modernist avant-guard artists of the early 20th century (Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani or Constantin Brâncuși). The Art Deco phenomenon owes to academic eclecticism and Neoclassicism mainly the existence of a specific architecture. Without the contribution of the Beaux-Arts trained architects, Art Deco architecture would have remained, with the exception of residential buildings, a collection of decorative objects magnified to an urban scale, like the pavilions of the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts from 1925, controversial at their time. Another reason for the swinging between historical elements and modernism was consumer culture. Objects and buildings in the puritan International style, devoid of any ornamentation or citation of the past, were too radical for the general public. In interwar France and England, the spirit of the public and much architectural criticism could not conceive a style totally deprived of ornament, like the International style.

The use of historic styles as sources of inspiration for Art Deco starts as far back as the years before WW1, through the efforts of decorators like Maurice Dufrêne, Paul Follot, Paul Iribe, André Groult, Léon Jallot or Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann, who relate to the prestigious French artistic and handicraft tradition of the late 18th and early 19th centuries (the Louis XVI, Directoire and Louis Philippe), and who want to bring a new approach to these styles. The neo-Louis XVI style was really popular in France and Romania in the years before WW1, around 1910, and it heavily influenced multiple early Art Deco designs and buildings. A good example of this is the Château de Sept-Saulx in Grand Est, France, by Louis Süe, 1928–1929.

===Neoclassicism and Totalitarian regimes===

In Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Romania under the rule of Carol II and the Soviet Union, during the 1920s and 1930s, totalitarian regimes chose Neoclassicism for state buildings and art. Architecture was central to totalitarian regimes&#x27; expression of their permanence (despite their obvious novelty). The way totalitarian regimes drew from Classicism took many forms. When it comes to state buildings in Italy and Romania, architects attempted to fuse a modern sensibility with abstract classical forms. Two good examples of this are the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in Rome, and the University Rectorate and Law Faculty Building in Bucharest (Bulevardul Mihail Kogălniceanu no. 36–46). In contrast, the Classicism of the Soviet Union, known as Socialist Realism, was bombastic, overloaded with ornaments and architectural sculptures, as an attempt to be in contrast with the simplicity of &#x27;Capitalist&#x27; or &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; styles like Art Deco or Modernism. The Lomonosov University in Moscow is a good example of this. Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader that succeeded Stalin, did not like this pompous Socialist Realist architecture from the reign of his predecessor. Because of the low speed and cost of these Neoclassical buildings, he stated that &#x27;they spent people&#x27;s money on beauty that no one needs, instead of building simpler, but more&#x27;.

In the Soviet Union, Neoclassicism was embraced as a rejection of Art Deco and Modernism, which the Communists saw as being too &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; and &#x27;capitalist&#x27;. This Communist Neoclassical style is known as Socialist Realism, and it was popular during the reign of Joseph Stalin (1924–1953). In fine art. Generally, it manifested through deeply idealized representations of wiry workers, shown as heroes in collective farms or industrialized cities, political assemblies, achievements of Soviet technology, and through depictions happy children staying around Lenin or Stalin. Both subject matter and representation were carefully monitored. Artistic merit was determined by the degree to which a work contributed to the building of socialism. All artists had to join the state-controlled Union of Soviet Artists and produce work in the accepted style. The three guiding principles of Socialist Realism were party loyalty, presentation of correct ideology and accessibility. Realism, more easily understood by the masses, was the style of choice. At the beginning, in the Soviet Union, multiple competing avant-garde movements were present, notably Constructivism. However, as Stalin consolidated his power towards the end of the 1920s, avant-garde art and architecture were suppressed and eventually outlawed and official state styles were established. After Boris Iofan won the competition for the design of the Palace of the Soviets with a stepped classical tower, surmounted by a giant statue of Lenin, architecture soon reverted to pre-Revolutionary styles of art and architecture, untainted by Constructivism&#x27;s perceived Western influence. Although Socialist Realism in architecture ended more or less with the death of Stalin and the rise of Nikita Khrushchev, paintings in this style continued to be produced, especially in countries where there was a strong personality cult of the leader in power, like in the case of Mao Zedong&#x27;s China, Kim Il Sung&#x27;s North Korea, or Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s Romania.

The Nazis suppressed Germany&#x27;s vibrant avant-garde culture once they gained control of the government in 1933. Albert Speer was set as Adolf Hitler&#x27;s architectural advisor in 1934, and he tried to create an architecture that would both reflect the perceived unity of the German people and act as backdrop to the Nazis&#x27; expressions of power. The Nazis&#x27; approach to architecture was riddled with contradictions: while Hitler and Speer&#x27;s plans for reordering Berlin aspired to imitate imperial Rome, in rural contexts Nazi buildings took inspiration from local vernaculars, trying to channel an &#x27;authentic&#x27; German spirit. When it come to fine art, the Nazis created the term &#x27;Degenerate art&#x27; for Modern art, a kind of art which to them was &#x27;un-German&#x27;, &#x27;Jewish&#x27; or &#x27;Communist&#x27;. The Nazis hated modern art and linked it to &#x27;Cultural Bolshevism&#x27;, the conspiracy theory that art (or culture broadly) was controlled by a leftist Jewish cabal seeking to destroy the aryan race. Hitler&#x27;s war on Modern art mostly consisted of an exhibition that tried to discredit Modern artists, called the &#x27;Degenerate Art exhibition&#x27; (). This exhibition was displayed next to the Great Exhibition of German Art, which consisted of artworks that the Nazis approved of. This way, the visitors of both exhibitions could compare the art labeled by the regime as &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27;. With a similar atitude, the regime closed in 1931 the Bauhaus, an avant-garde art school in Dessau that was extremely influential post-war. It reopened in Berlin in 1932, but was closed again in 1933.

Compared to Germany and the Soviet Union, in Italy the avant-garde contributed to state architecture. Classical architecture was also an influence, echoing Benito Mussolini&#x27;s far cruder attempts to create links between his Fascist regime and ancient Rome. Some Italian architects tried to create fusions between Modernism and Classicism, like Marcello Piacentini with the Sapienza University of Rome, or Giuseppe Terragni with Casa del Fascio in Como.

In Romania, towards the late 1930s, influenced by the Autocratic tendency of King Carol II, multiple state buildings were erected. They were Neoclassical, many very similar with what was popular in the same years in Fascist Italy. Examples in Bucharest include the University Rectorate and Law Faculty Building (Bulevardul Mihail Kogălniceanu no. 36–46), the Kretzulescu Apartment Building (Calea Victoriei no. 45), the CFR Building (Bulevardul Dinicu Golescu no. 38) or the Victoria Palace (Piața Victoriei no. 1). The Royal Palace, whose interiors are mostly done in a neo-Adam style, stands out by being more decorated, a little closer to the architecture before World War I.

===Postmodernism===
An early text questioning Modernism was by architect Robert Venturi, &quot;Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture&quot; (1966), in which he recommended a revival of the &#x27;presence of the past&#x27; in architectural design. He tried to include in his own buildings qualities that he described as &#x27;inclusion, inconsistency, compromise, accommodation, adaptation, superadjacency, equivalence, multiple focus, juxtaposition, or good and bad space.&#x27; Robert Venturi&#x27;s work reflected the broader counter-cultural mood of the 1960s which saw younger generations begin to question and challenge the political, social and racial realities with which they found themselves confronted. This rejection of Modernism is known as Postmodernism. Robert Venturi parodies Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s well-known maxim &#x27;less is more&#x27; with &#x27;less is a bore&#x27;. During the 1980s and 1990s, some Postmodern architects found a refuge in a sort of Neo-Neoclassicism. Their use of Classicism was not limited only to ornaments, using more or less proportions and other principles too. Post-Modern Classicism had been variously described by some people as &#x27;camp&#x27; or &#x27;kitsch&#x27;. An architect who has been remarked through Post-Modern Classicism is Ricardo Bofill. His work includes two housing projects of titanic scale near Paris, known as Les Arcades du Lac from 1975 to 1981, and Les Espaces d&#x27;Abraxas from 1978 to 1983. A building that stands out through its revivalism is the J. Paul Getty Museum, in Malibu, California, from 1970 to 1975, inspired by the ancient Roman Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. The J. Paul Getty Museum is far closer to 19th century Neoclassicism, like the Pompejanum in Aschaffenburg, Germany, than to Post-Modern Classicism of the 1980s.

===Architecture in the 21st century===
After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.

As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of New Classical Architecture. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism. Also, a number of pieces of postmodern architecture draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, Antigone District and the National Theatre of Catalonia in Barcelona among them. Postmodern architecture occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.

For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term Traditional Architecture (or vernacular) is mostly used. The Driehaus Architecture Prize is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize.

In the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville being an example.

In Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: Quinlan Terry&#x27;s Maitland Robinson Library at Downing College and Robert Adam Architects&#x27; Sackler Library.

<doc id="183283" wikidata="Q462768" url="?curid=183283" title="Antiochus I of Commagene">
<text>Antiochus I Theos Dikaios Epiphanes Philorhomaios Philhellen (, meaning &quot;Antiochos, the just, eminent god, friend of Romans and friend of Greeks&quot;, ) was king of the Greco-Iranian kingdom of Commagene and the most famous king of that kingdom.

The ruins of the tomb-sanctuary of Antiochus atop Mount Nemrut in Turkey were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1987. Several sandstone bas reliefs discovered at the site contain some of the oldest known images of two figures shaking hands.
The reliefs portrayed Greco-Iranian deities, along with the goddess Commagene and also even Antiochus himself represented in a deified status. Antiochus was one of the last rulers of a Persian-Macedonian court before the advent of the Romans.

==Family, ancestry and early life==
Antiochus I was the son of king Mithridates I Callinicus and queen Laodice VII Thea of Commagene. Antiochus was half Iranian, a distant member of the Orontid dynasty and half Greek. Antiochus&#x27; father Mithridates was the son of King Sames II Theosebes Dikaios of Commagene and an unidentified woman. Mithridates was possibly related to the kings of Parthia and, in the light of archaeological discoveries at Mount Nemrut, claimed descent from Orontes and also claimed Darius I of Persia as an ancestor, thanks to Orontes&#x27; marriage to Rhodogune, daughter of Artaxerxes II, who was a descendant of king Darius I.

More certain are his dynastic connections to the Diadochi. Antiochus’ mother, Laodice VII Thea, was a Greek princess of the Seleucid Empire. Laodice&#x27;s father was the Seleucid King Antiochus VIII Grypus, while her mother was a Ptolemaic princess and later Seleucid Queen Tryphaena (see Cleopatra VI of Egypt). Thus, Antiochus was a direct descendant of Seleucus I Nicator of the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemy I Soter of Egypt, Antigonus I Monophthalmus of Macedonia and Asia, Lysimachus of Thrace and the Macedonian regent, Antipater. These five men, the Diadochi &#x27;successors&#x27;, had served as generals under Alexander the Great. Antiochus’ parents had married as part of a peace alliance between their kingdoms. Little is known of his early life and education, aside from its philhellenic aspect; however, it seems that when his father died in 70 , Antiochus succeeded his father as king.

Antiochus married Isias, daughter of King Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia. They had five children:
* Mithridates II of Commagene, succeeded Antiochus as King of Commagene after his death in 31 
* Laodice, who married King Orodes II of Parthia
* Prince Antiochus II of Commagene
* Antiochis of Commagene

==Reign==
Commagene was a minor kingdom located in the highlands of northern Syria; to the north, it bordered Cappadocia, while it bordered Osroene to the south. It was initially a vassal state of the Seleucids, where it was considerably Hellenized. In the 1st century , however, Iranian culture experienced a resurgence, intentionally supported by Commagene in order to highlight its ancient ancestry and refute Seleucid, Parthian and Roman claims over the area. Under Antiochus, his kingdom experienced hardships during the Roman war with Pontus and Armenia. Armenia at first managed to extend its influence over Commagene, but Antiochus was ultimately forced to side with the Romans when the commander Pompey declared war against him.

Antiochus claims in his inscription on Mount Nemrut that he was a &quot;friend of the Romans&quot; (&quot;philoromaios&quot;), but was seen with some distrust by a few of the informants of Roman politician Cicero. His Iranian lineage made him lean toward the Parthian realm. He enjoyed good relations with the king of Media Atropatene, Darius, who seemingly helped him against Pompey. Antiochus made an alliance with the Parthian monarch Orodes II (), which was cemented with Orodes&#x27; marriage to Antiochus&#x27; daughter, Laodice. However, in 51  Antiochus provided Cicero with intelligence of the movements of a Parthian force led by prince Pacorus I. Ultimately Antiochus chose the Parthians over the Romans. In 38 , Pacorus was defeated and killed by the Romans; the remnants of his army fled to Commagene, where they took refuge.

The Roman general Publius Ventidius marched towards Commagene to punish Antiochus for his desertion. He laid siege to the capital Samosata, where Antiochus resided. Antiochus attempted to reach a compromise by offering 1,000 talents as reimbursement and a renewed alliance with the Romans. The Roman commander-in-chief Mark Antony declined the offer and had Ventidius&#x27; dismissed, with himself taking over the siege. He was, however, unable to capture the capital, and instead resorted to accept Antiochus&#x27; new offer of 300 talents. The life of Antiochus becomes obscure after this; according to Cassius Dio, he was killed by the Parthian king Phraates IV, in .

==Mount Nemrut==

Antiochus is famous for building the impressive religious sanctuary of Mount Nemrut. When Antiochus reigned as king he was creating a royal cult for himself and preparing to be worshipped after his death. Antiochus was inspired to create his own cult in the Greek form of the religion Zoroastrianism. Antiochus left many Greek inscriptions revealing many aspects of his religion and explaining his purpose of action. In one inscription, Antiochus directed that his tomb should be built in a high and holy place, remote from people and close to the gods, among whom he would be numbered. Antiochus wanted his body to be preserved for eternity. The gods he worshipped were a syncretism of Greek and Iranian gods, such as Heracles-Artagnes-Ares, Zeus-Oromasdes, and Apollo-Mithras-Helios-Hermes. The monumental effigies at the site show both Persian and Greek iconographic influences: Persian influences can be seen in the clothes, headgear and the colossal size of the images, while the depiction of their physical features derives from Greek artistic style.

Antiochus practised astrology of a very esoteric kind, and laid the basis for a calendrical reform, by linking the Commagenian year, which until then had been based on the movements of the Moon, to the Sothic (Star of Sirius) cycle used by the Egyptians as the basis of their calendar. This would suggest that Antiochus was knowledgeable about, if not fully initiated into Hermeticism.

Antiochus’ tomb complex was constructed in a way that religious festivities could occur there. Every month there were two feast days for Antiochus: His coronation, which was celebrated on the 10th of each month, and his birthday, which was celebrated on the 16th of each month. He allocated funds for these events from properties legally bound to the site. He also appointed families of priests and hierodules to conduct the rituals, and their descendants were intended to continue the ritual service in perpetuity. The priests wore traditional Persian robes and adorned the images of the gods and Antiochus&#x27; ancestors with gold crowns. The priests offered incense, herbs, and other unspecified &quot;splendid sacrifices&quot; on altars set before each image. All the citizens and military were invited to the banquets in honour of the illustrious deceased. During the feasts, grudging attitudes were forbidden and Antiochus decreed that the people should enjoy themselves, drink wine, eat, and listen to the sacred music performed by the temple musicians.

Antiochus’ tomb was forgotten for centuries, until 1883 when archaeologists from Germany excavated it. From his found inscriptions, Antiochus appears to have been a pious person and had a generous spirit. The ruins of the royal palace have been found in another city of the kingdom, Arsameia. This palace is known as &quot;Eski Kale&quot; or &#x27;Old Castle&#x27;. In Arsameia, Antiochus left many inscriptions in Greek describing his public works program, and how he glorified the city.

<text>Life extension is the concept of extending the human lifespan, either modestly through improvements in medicine or dramatically by increasing the maximum lifespan beyond its generally-settled biological limit of around 125 years. Several researchers in the area, along with &quot;life extensionists&quot;, &quot;immortalists&quot;, or &quot;longevists&quot; (those who wish to achieve longer lives themselves), postulate that future breakthroughs in tissue rejuvenation, stem cells, regenerative medicine, molecular repair, gene therapy, pharmaceuticals, and organ replacement (such as with artificial organs or xenotransplantations) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition (agerasia). The ethical ramifications, if life extension becomes a possibility, are debated by bioethicists.

The sale of purported anti-aging products such as supplements and hormone replacement is a lucrative global industry. For example, the industry that promotes the use of hormones as a treatment for consumers to slow or reverse the aging process in the US market generated about $50 billion of revenue a year in 2009. The use of such hormone products has not been proven to be effective or safe.

==Average life expectancy and lifespan==

During the process of aging, an organism accumulates damage to its macromolecules, cells, tissues, and organs. Specifically, aging is characterized as and thought to be caused by &quot;genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication.&quot; Oxidation damage to cellular contents caused by free radicals is believed to contribute to aging as well.

The longest documented human lifespan is 122 years 164 days, the case of Jeanne Calment, who according to records was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a wildtype mouse, commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about three years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of DNA repair, antioxidant defenses, energy metabolism, proteostasis maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy.

The average life expectancy in a population is lowered by infant and child mortality, which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to accidents and age-related chronic disease such as cancer or cardiovascular disease play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of life expectancy and lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, vaccinations, good diet, exercise, and avoidance of hazards such as smoking.

Maximum lifespan is determined by the rate of aging for a species inherent in its genes and by environmental factors. Widely recognized methods of extending maximum lifespan in model organisms such as nematodes, fruit flies, and mice include caloric restriction, gene manipulation, and administration of pharmaceuticals. Another technique uses evolutionary pressures such as breeding from only older members or altering levels of extrinsic mortality.
Some animals such as hydra, planarian flatworms, and certain sponges, corals, and jellyfish do not die of old age and exhibit potential immortality.

==History==

The extension of life has been a desire of humanity and a mainstay motif in the history of scientific pursuits and ideas throughout history, from the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and the Egyptian Smith medical papyrus, all the way through the Taoists, Ayurveda practitioners, alchemists, hygienists such as Luigi Cornaro, Johann Cohausen and Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland, and philosophers such as Francis Bacon, René Descartes, Benjamin Franklin and Nicolas Condorcet. However, the beginning of the modern period in this endeavor can be traced to the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th century, to the so-called &quot;fin-de-siècle&quot; (end of the century) period, denoted as an &quot;end of an epoch&quot; and characterized by the rise of scientific optimism and therapeutic activism, entailing the pursuit of life extension (or life-extensionism). Among the foremost researchers of life extension at this period were the Nobel Prize winning biologist Elie Metchnikoff (1845-1916) -- the author of the cell theory of immunity and vice director of Institut Pasteur in Paris, and Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard (1817-1894) -- the president of the French Biological Society and one of the founders of modern endocrinology.

Sociologist James Hughes claims that science has been tied to a cultural narrative of conquering death since the Age of Enlightenment. He cites Francis Bacon (1561–1626) as an advocate of using science and reason to extend human life, noting Bacon&#x27;s novel &quot;New Atlantis&quot;, wherein scientists worked toward delaying aging and prolonging life. Robert Boyle (1627–1691), founding member of the Royal Society, also hoped that science would make substantial progress with life extension, according to Hughes, and proposed such experiments as &quot;to replace the blood of the old with the blood of the young&quot;. Biologist Alexis Carrel (1873–1944) was inspired by a belief in indefinite human lifespan that he developed after experimenting with cells, says Hughes.

===Contemporary===

Regulatory and legal struggles between the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Life Extension organization included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, Saul Kent and Bill Faloon, the principals of the organization, were jailed for four hours and were released on $850,000 bond each. After 11 years of legal battles, Kent and Faloon convinced the US Attorney&#x27;s Office to dismiss all criminal indictments brought against them by the FDA.

In 2003, Doubleday published &quot;The Immortal Cell: One Scientist&#x27;s Quest to Solve the Mystery of Human Aging,&quot; by Michael D. West. West emphasised the potential role of embryonic stem cells in life extension.

Other modern life extensionists include writer Gennady Stolyarov, who insists that death is &quot;the enemy of us all, to be fought with medicine, science, and technology&quot;; transhumanist philosopher Zoltan Istvan, who proposes that the &quot;transhumanist must safeguard one&#x27;s own existence above all else&quot;; futurist George Dvorsky, who considers aging to be a problem that desperately needs to be solved; and recording artist Steve Aoki, who has been called &quot;one of the most prolific campaigners for life extension&quot;.

====Scientific research====

In 1991, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) was formed. The American Board of Medical Specialties recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M&#x27;s professional standing.

In 2003, Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel formed the Methuselah Foundation, which gives financial grants to anti-aging research projects. In 2009, de Grey and several others founded the SENS Research Foundation, a California-based scientific research organization which conducts research into aging and funds other anti-aging research projects at various universities. In 2013, Google announced Calico, a new company based in San Francisco that will harness new technologies to increase scientific understanding of the biology of aging. It is led by Arthur D. Levinson, and its research team includes scientists such as Hal V. Barron, David Botstein, and Cynthia Kenyon. In 2014, biologist Craig Venter founded Human Longevity Inc., a company dedicated to scientific research to end aging through genomics and cell therapy. They received funding with the goal of compiling a comprehensive human genotype, microbiome, and phenotype database.

Aside from private initiatives, aging research is being conducted in university laboratories, and includes universities such as Harvard and UCLA. University researchers have made a number of breakthroughs in extending the lives of mice and insects by reversing certain aspects of aging.

==Research==
Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan in humans could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage by periodic replacement of damaged tissues, molecular repair or rejuvenation of deteriorated cells and tissues, reversal of harmful epigenetic changes, or the enhancement of enzyme telomerase activity.

Research geared towards life extension strategies in various organisms is currently under way at a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators have found ways to increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction. A 2009 review of longevity research noted: &quot;Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable life extension factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm&#x27;s lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a &quot;life-extension factor&quot; that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology.&quot;

=== Anti-aging drugs ===

There are numerous chemicals intended to slow the aging process under study in animal models. One type of research is related to the observed effects of a calorie restriction (CR) diet, which has been shown to extend lifespan in some animals. Based on that research, there have been attempts to develop drugs that will have the same effect on the aging process as a CR diet, which are known as caloric restriction mimetic drugs, such as rapamycin and metformin.

Sirtuin activating polyphenols, such as resveratrol and pterostilbene, and flavonoids, such as quercetin and fisetin, as well as oleic acid are dietary supplements that have also been studied in this context. Other common supplements with less clear biological pathways to target aging include lipoic acid, senolytics, and coenzyme Q10. 

While agents such as these have some limited laboratory evidence of efficacy in animals, there are no studies to date in humans for drugs that may promote life extension, mainly because research investment remains at a low level, and regulatory standards are high. Aging is not recognized as a preventable condition by governments, indicating there is no clear pathway to approval of anti-aging medications. Further, anti-aging drug candidates are under constant review by regulatory authorities like the US Food and Drug Administration, which stated in 2023 that &quot;no medication has been proven to slow or reverse the aging process.&quot;

=== Nanotechnology ===
Future advances in nanomedicine could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. K. Eric Drexler, one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular computers, in his 1986 book &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;. Raymond Kurzweil, a futurist and transhumanist, stated in his book &quot;The Singularity Is Near&quot; that he believes that advanced medical nanorobotics could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030. According to Richard Feynman, it was his former graduate student and collaborator Albert Hibbs who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a &quot;medical&quot; use for Feynman&#x27;s theoretical nanomachines (see biological machine). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) &quot;swallow the doctor&quot;. The idea was incorporated into Feynman&#x27;s 1959 essay &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom.&quot;

=== Cyborgs ===

Replacement of biological (susceptible to diseases) organs with mechanical ones could extend life. This is the goal of the 2045 Initiative.
=== Cryonics ===

Cryonics is the low-temperature freezing (usually at ) of a human corpse, with the hope that may be possible in the future. It is regarded with skepticism within the mainstream scientific community and has been characterized as quackery.

=== Strategies for engineered negligible senescence ===

Another proposed life extension technology aims to combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. SENS proposes that rejuvenation may be obtained by removing aging damage via the use of stem cells and tissue engineering, telomere-lengthening machinery, allotopic expression of mitochondrial proteins, targeted ablation of cells, immunotherapeutic clearance, and novel lysosomal hydrolases.

While some biogerontologists find these ideas &quot;worthy of discussion&quot;, others contend that the alleged benefits are too speculative given the current state of technology, referring to it as &quot;fantasy rather than science&quot;.

==Genetic editing==

Genome editing, in which nucleic acid polymers are delivered as a drug and are either expressed as proteins, interfere with the expression of proteins, or correct genetic mutations, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.

===CRISPR/Cas9===

CRISPR/Cas9 edits genes by precisely cutting DNA and then harnessing natural DNA repair processes to modify the gene in the desired manner. The system has two components: the Cas9 enzyme and a guide RNA. A large array of genetic modifications have been found to increase lifespan in model organisms such as yeast, nematode worms, fruit flies, and mice. As of 2013, the longest extension of life caused by a single gene manipulation was roughly 50% in mice and 10-fold in nematode worms.
In July 2020 scientists, using public biological data on 1.75 m people with known lifespans overall, identify 10 genomic loci which appear to intrinsically influence healthspan, lifespan, and longevity – of which half have not been reported previously at genome-wide significance and most being associated with cardiovascular disease – and identify haem metabolism as a promising candidate for further research within the field. Their study suggests that high levels of iron in the blood likely reduce, and genes involved in metabolising iron likely increase healthy years of life in humans. The same month other scientists report that yeast cells of the same genetic material and within the same environment age in two distinct ways, describe a biomolecular mechanism that can determine which process dominates during aging and genetically engineer a novel aging route with substantially extended lifespan.

===Fooling genes===
In &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, Richard Dawkins describes an approach to life-extension that involves &quot;fooling genes&quot; into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by &quot;identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body&quot;.

=== Cloning and body part replacement ===
Some life extensionists suggest that therapeutic cloning and stem cell research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as reproductive cloning) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. In 2008, the US Department of Defense announced a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice. Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to rejection and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients&#x27; own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease. Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human stem cells, particularly embryonic stem cells, is controversial. Opponents&#x27; objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations. Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to reproductive cloning. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

==Ethics and politics ==

===Scientific controversy===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, Leonard Hayflick, who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50 cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy. Hayflick and fellow biogerontologists Jay Olshansky and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging supplements.

===Consumer motivations ===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. When product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self.

===Political parties===
Though many scientists state that life extension and radical life extension are possible, there are still no international or national programs focused on radical life extension. There are political forces working both for and against life extension. By 2012, in Russia, the United States, Israel, and the Netherlands, the Longevity political parties started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies, and ensure the fastest possible and at the same time soft transition of society to the next step – life without aging and with radical life extension, and to provide access to such technologies to most currently living people.

===Silicon Valley===
Some tech innovators and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have invested heavily into anti-aging research. This includes Jeff Bezos (founder of Amazon), Larry Ellison (founder of Oracle), Peter Thiel (former PayPal CEO), Larry Page (co-founder of Google), Peter Diamandis, Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI, invested in Retro Biosciences), and Brian Armstrong (founder of Coinbase and NewLimit), Bryan Johnson (Founder of Kernel).

===Commentators===
Leon Kass (chairman of the US President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of overpopulation problems would make life extension unethical. He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.

Transhumanist philosopher Nick Bostrom has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few. In an extended metaphor entitled &quot;The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant&quot;, Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.

===Overpopulation concerns===

Controversy about life extension is due to fear of overpopulation and possible effects on society. Biogerontologist Aubrey De Grey counters the overpopulation critique by pointing out that the therapy could postpone or eliminate menopause, allowing women to space out their pregnancies over more years and thus &quot;decreasing&quot; the yearly population growth rate. Moreover, the philosopher and futurist Max More argues that, given that the worldwide population growth rate is slowing down and is projected to eventually stabilize and begin falling, superlongevity would be unlikely to contribute to overpopulation.

===Opinion polls===

A Spring 2013 Pew Research poll in the United States found that 38% of Americans would want life extension treatments, and 56% would reject it. However, it also found that 68% believed most people would want it and that only 4% consider an &quot;ideal lifespan&quot; to be more than 120 years. The median &quot;ideal lifespan&quot; was 91 years of age and the majority of the public (63%) viewed medical advances aimed at prolonging life as generally good. 41% of Americans believed that radical life extension (RLE) would be good for society, while 51% said they believed it would be bad for society. One possibility for why 56% of Americans claim they would reject life extension treatments may be due to the cultural perception that living longer would result in a longer period of decrepitude, and that the elderly in our current society are unhealthy.

Religious people are no more likely to oppose life extension than the unaffiliated, though some variation exists between religious denominations.

===Aging as a disease===
Most mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. Biologist David Sinclair says: &quot;I don&#x27;t see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body.&quot; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not. However, not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, director of academic affairs for AARP, notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depend on a historical context. David Gems, assistant director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, argues that aging should be viewed as a disease. In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that Basenji are not dogs because they do not bark. Because of the universality of aging he calls it a &quot;special sort of disease&quot;. Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms &quot;aging syndrome&quot; and &quot;disease complex&quot; in 1954 to describe aging.

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. One view is, this would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.

==Beliefs and methods==
===Senolytics and prolongevity drugs===

Senolytics eliminate senescent cells whereas senomorphics – with candidates such as Apigenin, Everolimus and Rapamycin – modulate properties of senescent cells without eliminating them, suppressing phenotypes of senescence, including the SASP. Senomorphic effects may be one major effect mechanism of a range of prolongevity drug candidates. Such candidates are however typically not studied for just one mechanism, but multiple. There are biological databases of prolongevity drug candidates under research as well as of potential gene/protein targets. These are enhanced by longitudinal cohort studies, electronic health records, computational (drug) screening methods, computational biomarker-discovery methods and computational biodata-interpretation/personalized medicine methods.

Besides rapamycin and senolytics, the drug-repurposing candidates studied most extensively include metformin, acarbose, spermidine and NAD+ enhancers.

Many prolongevity drugs are synthetic alternatives or potential complements to existing nutraceuticals, such as various sirtuin-activating compounds under investigation like SRT2104. In some cases pharmaceutical administration is combined with that of neutraceuticals – such as in the case of glycine combined with NAC. Often studies are structured based on or thematize specific prolongevity targets, listing both nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals (together or separately) such as FOXO3-activators.

Researchers are also exploring ways to mitigate side-effects from such substances (possibly most notably rapamycin and its derivatives) such as via protocols of intermittent administration and have called for research that helps determine optimal treatment schedules (including timing) in general.

===Diets and supplements===
====Vitamins and antioxidants====

The free-radical theory of aging suggests that antioxidant supplements might extend human life. Reviews, however, have found that use of vitamin A (as β-carotene) and vitamin E supplements possibly can increase mortality. Other reviews have found no relationship between vitamin E and other vitamins with mortality. Vitamin D supplementation of various dosages is investigated in trials and there also is research into GlyNAC .

====Complications====
Complications of antioxidant supplementation (especially continuous high dosages far above the RDA) include that reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are mitigated by antioxidants, &quot;have been found to be physiologically vital for signal transduction, gene regulation, and redox regulation, among others, implying that their complete elimination would be harmful&quot;. In particular, one way of multiple they can be detrimental is by inhibiting adaptation to exercise such as muscle hypertrophy (e.g. during dedicated periods of caloric surplus). There is also research into stimulating/activating/fueling endogenous antioxidant generation, in particular e.g. of neutraceutical glycine and pharmaceutical NAC. Antioxidants can change the oxidation status of different e.g. tissues, targets or sites each with potentially different implications, especially for different concentrations. A review suggests mitochondria have a hormetic response to ROS, whereby low oxidative damage can be beneficial.

====Dietary restriction====
As of 2021, there is no clinical evidence that any dietary restriction practice contributes to human longevity.

====Healthy diet====
Research suggests that increasing adherence to Mediterranean diet patterns is associated with a reduction in total and cause-specific mortality, extending health- and lifespan. Research is identifying the key beneficial components of the Mediterranean diet. Studies suggest dietary changes are a factor of national relative rises in life-span.

====Optimal diet====

Approaches to develop optimal diets for health- and lifespan (or &quot;longevity diets&quot;) include:
* modifying the Mediterranean diet as the baseline via nutrition science. For instance, via:
**(additional) increase in plant-based foods alongside additional restriction of meat intake – meat reduction is (or can be) typically healthy,
**keeping alcohol consumption of any type at a minimum – conventional Mediterranean diets include alcohol consumption (i.e. of wine), which is under research due to data suggesting negative long-term brain impacts even at low/moderate consumption levels. 
**fully replacing refined grains – some guidelines of Mediterranean diets do not clarify or include the principle of whole-grain consumption instead of refined grains. Whole grains are included in Mediterranean diets.

===Other approaches===
Further advanced biosciences-based approaches include:
* Genetic and epigenetic alterations: Human genetic enhancement for pro-longevity and protective genes – see genetics of aging
* Cellular reprogramming: in vivo reprogramming to complement or augment human regenerative capacity and rejuvenate or replace cells
* Epigenetic reprogramming: early-stage research about rejuvenating/repairing epigenetic machinery
* Stem-cell interventions: &quot;Increasing the number and quality of stem cells and activate regenerative signals&quot;
* Nanomedicine: early-stage research of in vivo pro-longevity nanotechnology
* Tissue engineering: of tissues and organs (see also: xenotransplantation and artificial organ)
*Endogenous circulating biomolecules: Blood proteins of blood from young animals have shown some pro-longevity potential in animal studies (e.g. via transfer of blood or plasma, and of plasma proteins). Moreover, exerkines – signalling biomolecules released during/after exercise – have also shown promising results. Exerkines include myokines. Extracellular vesicles were shown to be secreted concomitantly with exerkines and are also investigated. (See also: body fluid and cerebrospinal fluid)
*Personalized interventions: future studies may tailor and investigate personalized medicine-type interventions. For instance, effects of interventions or e.g. dosages may vary per age and/or genome. A review suggests that the field of precision medicine and geroscience will have to interact closely (see also: combination therapy)
* Peptides: such as MOTS-c released by mitochondria
* Mitochondria modulation: early-stage research indicates mitochondrial interventions such as mitochondrial transplantation may have potential to be efficacious (See also: mitochondrial theory of ageing)

====Within the field====

There is a need and research into the development of aging biomarkers such as the epigenetic clock &quot;to assess the ageing process and the efficacy of interventions to bypass the need for large-scale longitudinal studies&quot;. Such biomarkers may also include in vivo brain imaging.

Reviews sometimes include structured tables that provide systematic overviews of intervention/drug candidates with a review calling for integrating &quot;current knowledge with multi-omics, health records, and drug safety data to predict drugs that can improve health in late life&quot; and listing major outstanding questions. Biological databases of prolongevity drug candidates under research as well as of potential gene/protein targets include GenAge, DrugAge and Geroprotectors.

A review has pointed out that the approach of &quot;&#x27;epidemiological&#x27; comparison of how a low versus a high consumption of an isolated macronutrient and its association with health and mortality may not only fail to identify protective or detrimental nutrition patterns but may lead to misleading interpretations&quot;. It proposes a multi-pillar approach, and summarizes findings towards constructing – multi-system-considering and at least age-personalized dynamic – refined longevity diets. Epidemiological-type observational studies included in meta-analyses should according to the study at least be complemented by &quot;(1) basic research focused on lifespan and healthspan, (2) carefully controlled clinical trials, and (3) studies of individuals and populations with record longevity&quot;.

===Hormone treatment===
The anti-aging industry offers several hormone therapies. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers and a lack of proven effect. For example, the American Medical Association has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.

While growth hormone (GH) decreases with age, the evidence for use of growth hormone as an anti-aging therapy is mixed and based mostly on animal studies. There are mixed reports that GH or IGF-1 modulates the aging process in humans and about whether the direction of its effect is positive or negative.

Klotho and exerkines like irisin are being investigated for potential pro-longevity therapies.

===Lifestyle factors===

Loneliness/isolation, social life and support, exercise/physical activity (partly via neurobiological effects and increased NAD+ levels), psychological characteristics/personality (possibly highly indirectly), sleep duration, circadian rhythms (patterns of sleep, drug-administration and feeding), type of leisure activities, not smoking, altruistic emotions and behaviors, subjective well-being, mood and stress (including via heat shock protein) are investigated as potential (modulatable) factors of life extension.

Healthy lifestyle practices and healthy diet have been suggested as &quot;first-line function-preserving strategies, with pharmacological agents, including existing and new pharmaceuticals and novel &#x27;nutraceutical&#x27; compounds, serving as potential complementary approaches&quot;.

===Societal strategies===
Collectively, addressing common causes of death could extend lifespans of populations and humanity overall. For instance, a 2020 study indicates that the global mean loss of life expectancy (LLE) from air pollution in 2015 was 2.9 years, substantially more than, for example, 0.3 years from all forms of direct violence, albeit a significant fraction of the LLE (a measure similar to years of potential life lost) is considered to be unavoidable.

Regular screening and doctor visits has been suggested as a lifestyle-societal intervention. (See also: medical test and biomarker)

Health policy and changes to standard healthcare could support the adoption of the field&#x27;s conclusions – a review suggests that the longevity diet would be a &quot;valuable complement to standard healthcare and that, taken as a preventative measure, it could aid in avoiding morbidity, sustaining health into advanced age&quot; as a form of preventive healthcare.

It has been suggested that in terms of healthy diets, Mediterranean-style diets could be promoted by countries for ensuring healthy-by-default choices (&quot;to ensure the healthiest choice is the easiest choice&quot;) and with highly effective measures including dietary education, food checklists and recipes that are &quot;simple, palatable, and affordable&quot;.

A review suggests that &quot;targeting the aging process per se may be a far more effective approach to prevent or delay aging-associated pathologies than treatments specifically targeted to particular clinical conditions&quot;.

===Low ambient temperature===
Low ambient temperature as a physical factor affecting free radical levels was identified as a treatment producing exceptional lifespan increase in Drosophila melanogaster and other living beings.
===Young blood conspiracy theory===
Conspiracy theorists claim that some clinics currently offer injection of blood products from young donors. The alleged benefits of the treatment, none of which have been demonstrated in a proper study, include a longer life, darker hair, better memory, better sleep, curing heart diseases, diabetes and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The approach is based on parabiosis studies such as those Irina Conboy has done on mice, but Conboy says young blood does not reverse aging (even in mice) and that those who offer those treatments have misunderstood her research. Neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray, who also studied blood exchanges on mice as recently as 2014, said people offering those treatments are &quot;basically abusing people&#x27;s trust&quot; and that young blood treatments are &quot;the scientific equivalent of fake news&quot;. The treatment appeared in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; fiction series.

Two clinics in California, run by Jesse Karmazin and David C. Wright, offer $8,000 injections of plasma extracted from the blood of young people. Karmazin has not published in any peer-reviewed journal and his current study does not use a control group.

===Microbiome alterations===
Fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics are being investigated as means for life and healthspan extension.

==Mind uploading==

One hypothetical future strategy that, as some suggest, &quot;eliminates&quot; the complications related to a physical body, involves the copying or transferring (e.g. by progressively replacing neurons with transistors) of a conscious mind from a biological brain to a non-biological computer system or computational device. The basic idea is to scan the structure of a particular brain in detail, and then construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain. Whether or not an exact copy of one&#x27;s mind constitutes actual life extension is matter of debate.

However, critics argue that the uploaded mind would simply be a clone and not a true continuation of a person&#x27;s consciousness.

Some scientists believe that the dead may one day be &quot;resurrected&quot; through simulation technology.

<doc id="183294" wikidata="Q772494" url="?curid=183294" title="Chess Records">
<text>Chess Records was an American record company established in 1950 in Chicago, specializing in blues and rhythm and blues. It was the successor to Aristocrat Records, founded in 1947. It expanded into soul music, gospel music, early rock and roll, and jazz and comedy recordings, released on the Chess and its subsidiary labels Checker and Argo/Cadet. The Chess catalogue is owned by Universal Music Group and managed by Geffen Records and Universal Music Enterprises.

Established and run by two Jewish immigrant brothers from what was then Poland, Leonard and Phil Chess, the company produced and released many singles and albums regarded as central to the rock music canon. The musician and critic Cub Koda described Chess as &quot;America&#x27;s greatest blues label&quot;.

Chess was based at several locations on the south side of Chicago, initially at South Cottage Grove Ave. The most famous was 2120 S. Michigan Avenue, from May 1957 to 1967 immortalized by the Rolling Stones in &quot;2120 South Michigan Avenue&quot;, an instrumental recorded there during the group&#x27;s first U.S. tour in 1964. In 1967, Chess relocated to a much larger building, the former home of Revere Camera Company at 320 E. 21st Street, the label&#x27;s final Chicago home. Shortly before the death of Leonard Chess in 1969, the Chess brothers sold the company. The Studio at 2120 South Michigan Avenue was designated a Chicago Landmark on May 16, 1990. In 1993 the building was purchased by Marie Dixon, the widow of Willie Dixon, and turned into a museum which opened in 1997
The building is now the home of Willie Dixon&#x27;s Blues Heaven Foundation.

==History==
===Chess brothers&#x27; company===

Leonard Chess bought a stake in Aristocrat Records in 1947. In 1950, he brought his brother, Phil, into the operation, and they became the sole owners of the company. In that same year, they bought out a third partner, Evelyn Aron, and renamed the company Chess Records.

The first release from Chess was a 78 RPM single, &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, backed with &quot;Bless You&quot;, by Gene Ammons, issued as Chess 1425 in June 1950, which became the label&#x27;s biggest hit of the year.

In 1951, the Chess brothers began an association with Sam Phillips, of the Memphis Recording Service, the forerunner of Sun Records. One of the most important recordings that Phillips gave to Chess was &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats (the band was actually Ike Turner&#x27;s Kings of Rhythm), which topped &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s R&amp;B Records chart and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998 in recognition of its influence on rock and roll. One of the most important artists that came out of Memphis was Howlin&#x27; Wolf, who stayed with the label until his death in 1976. Musical figures created for Chess by Bo Diddley, Willie Dixon, Chuck Berry, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Muddy Waters, Buddy Guy, and others were the basis of much subsequent rock and roll. Many songs created by Chess artists were later covered by many rock artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Cream, Fleetwood Mac, Ten Years After, the Beach Boys and Eric Clapton.

In 1952, the brothers started Checker Records as an alternative label for radio play (radio stations had a policy of playing only a limited number of records from any one imprint). In December 1955, they launched a jazz and pop label, Marterry, a name created from the first names of Leonard and Phil&#x27;s sons, Marshall and Terry. This was quickly renamed Argo Records, but the name was changed again in 1965 to Cadet Records to end confusion with an existing British spoken-word label.

In 1953, Leonard Chess and Gene Goodman set up Arc Music BMI, a publishing company, which published songs by many rhythm and blues artists.

In the mid-1950s, the Chess brothers received two doo-wop groups by Alan Freed, the Coronets and the Moonglows; the former group was not very popular but the latter achieved several major crossover hits including &quot;Sincerely&quot;, which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002. Several of Chess&#x27;s releases gave a writing credit to Alan Freed.

During the 1950s, Leonard and Phil Chess handled most of the recording production themselves. They brought in producer Ralph Bass in 1960 to handle the gospel output and some of the blues singers. Bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon was also heavily involved in organizing blues sessions for the label and is now credited retroactively as a producer on some re-releases. During the 1960s, the company&#x27;s A&amp;R manager and chief producer for soul and R&amp;B recordings was Roquel &quot;Billy&quot; Davis, who had previously worked with Motown founder Berry Gordy on songs for Jackie Wilson, Etta James, Marv Johnson and other early Motown releases.

In May 1957, the Chess brothers moved to a building at 2120 South Michigan Avenue in Chicago. The studio would operate at this location until 1967 when they relocated to 320 East 21st Street.

In 1958, Chess began producing their first LP records which included such albums as &quot;After School Session&quot; by Chuck Berry, &quot;The Best of Muddy Waters&quot;, &quot;The Best of Little Walter&quot;, and &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;.

Chess Records was also known for its regular band of session musicians who played on most of the company&#x27;s Chicago soul recordings, including the drummer Maurice White and the bassist Louis Satterfield, both of whom later shaped the funk group Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; the guitarists Pete Cosey, Gerald Sims and Phil Upchurch; the pianist Leonard Caston, later a producer for Motown; and the organist Sonny Thompson. In 1962, Chess Records was sued by Peacock Records for recording their artists Reverend Robert Ballinger and the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi.

In 1969, Chess Records established a subsidiary label in the U.K., Middle Earth Records, which was distributed by Pye Records. The subsidiary specialized in Psychedelic rock and was a joint venture with the Middle Earth Club in London. The Middle Earth label released only four albums and about a dozen singles before it closed in 1970.

The company was briefly run by Marshall Chess, Leonard&#x27;s son, in his position as vice president between January and October 1969 and then as president following its acquisition by GRT, before he went on to found Rolling Stones Records.

===Under GRT and All Platinum===
In early 1969, the Chess brothers sold the label to General Recorded Tape (GRT) for $6.5 million. In October 1969, Leonard Chess died and by 1972, the only part of Chess Records still operating in Chicago was the recording studio, Ter-Mar Studios. Following the sale of Chess to GRT, Phil left the label to run radio station WVON. In the 1970s, Chess Records and its publishing arm, Arc Music, were successfully sued by Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon for nonpayment of royalties due to them. Ter-Mar Studios continued to operate at the 320 E. 21st St. building until its closure in 1979.

Some of the other artists who contributed to the legacy of Chess Records were the Flamingos, the Moonglows, Fontella Bass, Billy Stewart, the Dells and the Ramsey Lewis Trio.

===Later incarnations===
In the early 1980s, noticing that much of the Chess catalogue was commercially unavailable, Marshall Chess was able to convince Joe and Sylvia Robinson, who ran All Platinum, to reissue the catalogue themselves under his supervision (All Platinum had been licensing selected tracks to other companies, which ultimately resulted in the disappearance of some original master tapes). The reissued singles and LPs sold well, but by the mid-80s All Platinum had fallen into financial difficulties, and the Chess master recordings were acquired by MCA Records, which itself was later merged with Geffen Records, a Universal Music imprint.

In the 1990s, MCA Records sued Charly Records for selling CDs which contained copyrighted material by Chess artists.

In February 1997, MCA started releasing eleven compilation albums for the 50th anniversary of Chess Records.

In the 2000s, Universal&#x27;s limited-edition reissue label, Hip-O Select, began releasing a series of comprehensive box sets devoted to such Chess artists as Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Little Walter, Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry.

In July 2008, the 2008 Universal Studios fire burned down a warehouse filled with Universal Music Group recording masters, including many albums and songs released by Chess. These masters, by artists such as Chuck Berry, were &quot;priceless&quot; and irreplaceable; while UMG claimed at the time it had copies, later investigative reporting questioned this, with the truth emerging that all the masters were destroyed.

Chess Records was the subject of two films produced in 2008, &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot;. In addition to the Chess brothers, both films feature portrayals of or characters based on Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Chuck Berry, Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Etta James. &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; was directed by Darnell Martin and features an ensemble cast including Adrien Brody (as Leonard Chess), Mos Def (as Chuck Berry), Beyoncé Knowles (as Etta James) and Jeffrey Wright (as Muddy Waters). &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; was directed by Tony Award winner Jerry Zaks and stars Alessandro Nivola playing Leonard Chess &quot;as a complicated, driven man, hard on both his musicians and his family, yet with a real love for some of America&#x27;s greatest music.&quot; The world premiere of the latter film was at the Toronto International Film Festival, September 11, 2008.

==Discography==
===Chess LP-1425 to LPS-1553 (1956–1970)===
The original Chess LP series started with LP-1425 and included albums on both the Chess and the Checker labels. After 1437, the series was used exclusively for the Chess label; the Checker label switched to a 2970 series.
===Chess Vintage Series===
The Chess Vintage LP series started with LP-407 and featured 9 albums released in 1970/71 with an additional three albums released in 1975.
===GRT consolidated Chess/Cadet album discography (1971–1975)===
In 1971 Chess Records was purchased by General Recorded Tape, also known as GRT Corporation, which consolidated both the Chess and Cadet labels into a single labeling number sequence.

<doc id="183295" wikidata="Q16247691" url="?curid=183295" title="DC Talk (album)">
<text>DC Talk is the first studio album released from vocal trio DC Talk. It is the most hip hop-oriented of all of their albums as each later album gradually progressed into a more rock-centered sound. Michael Tait stated that their original goal for the album was to sell 10,000 units. It sold 7,142 units in 1989. After their popularity spiked with the release of &quot;Free at Last&quot;, back sales increased although it is the only of their studio albums to not reach RIAA gold status (500,000 units sold).

==Track listing==
===In the Free at Last tour===
# &quot;Heavenbound&quot;
# &quot;Time Ta Jam&quot;
# &quot;He Loves Me&quot;

==Recording==
DC Talk (consisting of Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max) signed their initial record deal with ForeFront Records in January 1989, along with Vic Mignogna and Mike Valliere. In the long-form video Narrow Is the Road, the group points out the apartment where the deal was signed. Dropping out of Liberty University, the trio moved to Nashville, TN and recording for &quot;DC Talk&quot; immediately began. Recording was a fast process as the album released June 13, 1989.

== Singles ==

The album&#x27;s opening track provided the majority of the album&#x27;s relative sales success. &quot;Heavenbound&quot; was originally recorded for the group&#x27;s independently released cassette demo, &quot;Christian Rhymes to a Rhythm&quot;, which featured only Tait and McKeehan. It was re-recorded after Kevin Max was added to the group just prior to this release. The album received a sales boost after the music video for &quot;Heavenbound&quot;, their first music video, received a mighty airplay on the BET network&#x27;s hip-hop show: &quot;Rap City&quot;. &quot;Heavenbound&quot; was included on the compilation &quot;Ultimate Rap&quot; (Starsong, 1989).

The second but minor hit was &quot;Spinnin&#x27; Round&quot; featuring their friend and beatboxer Mike &quot;DJ Valet Beat&quot; Valliere who beatboxed on both &quot;Final Days&quot; and &quot;Time Ta Jam&quot;. &quot;Spinnin&#x27; Round&quot; was included on the compilations &quot;Rappin&#x27; His Word: Today&#x27;s Hottest Christian Rap&quot; (Arrival Recordings, 1990) and &quot;Rap - Straight From the Streets&quot; (Benson, 1990).

Both songs were included in the compilation album, &quot;dc talk: The Early Years&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Gah Ta Be&quot; was featured on &quot;Ultimate Rap 2&quot; (Starsong, 1990).

The album &quot;Christian Rhymes to a Rhythm&quot; included &quot;Always Leanin&#x27;&quot; which was excluded from this album.

==Sales==
The album released to minimum sales on June 13, 1989. The album grossed 7,142 units by the end of 1989. Christian albums are tracked on Billboard&#x27;s Top Contemporary Albums chart, which then tracked the top forty albums on a bi-weekly basis (now weekly). DC Talk managed to break onto the chart just once in 1989 (No. 34 on November 18, 1989). Seven months later, in June 1990, the album returned to Top 40 on the June 2 and June 16 charts (No. 32 and No. 39, respectively). The trio&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nu Thang&quot;, broke into the Top 10 in November 1990 and remained in at least the Top 12 for six straight months. It peaked at No. 5 three times during this run. The success of &quot;Nu Thang&quot; led to an interest in &quot;DC Talk&quot; far higher than it ever enjoyed on its own. After reaching the Top 40 only six times, and no higher than No. 32, in its first two and a half years, &quot;DC Talk&quot; soared to No. 18 for the chart of November 2, 1991. Proving it was no fluke, it remained on the chart for the next two and a half months. It peaked at No. 10 on November 30, 1991 but had other Top 20 showings of No. 11, No. 14 (twice), and No. 19 at various points of its run. After its rather humble beginning, DC Talk crossed the 100,000 units-sold mark.

==Reworked Live Versions==
Two songs from &quot;DC Talk&quot; were reworked for the Free at Last World Tour in 1994. The first eight lines of lyrics from &quot;Time ta Jam&quot; were updated into a live-only song, which introduced by name the group&#x27;s touring band members, called &quot;Back 2 the Basics.&quot; Footage can be seen in the long-form video &quot;Narrow is the Road&quot;. Also on the Free at Last World Tour was a completely reworked version of &quot;Heavenbound&quot; that brought the song into the combo rap/rock sound of the Free at Last era. This version of &quot;Heavenbound&quot; has never been commercially released in audio or video format. An even different version of &quot;Heavenbound&quot; was included on The Supernatural Experience tour. It was &quot;freestyled&quot; by Toby McKeehan and bass player Otto Price (a.k.a. &quot;Sugar Bear&quot;). A clip of this version is included on the DVD/VHS &quot;The Supernatural Experience&quot;.

<text>Adolph Franz Friedrich Ludwig [[Freiherr]] Knigge (16 October 17526 May 1796) was a German writer, Freemason, and a leading member of the Order of the Illuminati.

== Biography ==
Adolph Freiherr von Knigge was born in Bredenbeck (now a part of Wennigsen, Lower Saxony) in the Electorate of Hanover as a member of the Knigge family, an old German nobility dating back to 13th century. He was the only son of Carl Philipp Freiherr Knigge (1723–1766) and his wife, Louise Wilhelmine Baroness Knigge (1730–1763), member of the same family from Weimar. When he was barely eleven, his mother died, and when his father died three years later the teenager inherited a large debt. His creditors took possession of the family property and assigned the boy a meagre pension of 500 thalers.

He studied law from 1769 to 1772 in Göttingen where he became a member of Corps Hannovera. He was allegedly initiated into Freemasonry in 1772 in Kassel, where he held a position as Court Squire (&quot;hofjunker&quot;) and Assessor of the War and Domains Exchequer. In 1777 he became Chamberlain at the Weimar court.

In 1780 Knigge joined Adam Weishaupt&#x27;s Bavarian Illuminati and his work with the Illuminati gave the group a great deal of publicity and influence of Masonic chapters. But in 1783 dissensions arose between Knigge and Weishaupt, which resulted in Knigge&#x27;s final withdrawal from the group on 1 July 1784. Knigge stated that he could no longer endure Weishaupt&#x27;s pedantic domineering, which frequently assumed offensive forms. He accused Weishaupt of &quot;Jesuitism&quot;, and suspected him of being &quot;a Jesuit in disguise&quot; (Nachtr., I, 129). &quot;And was I&quot;, he adds, &quot;to labour under his banner for mankind, to lead men under the yoke of so stiff-necked a fellow?—Never!&quot;

Knigge&#x27;s involvement with the Illuminati, support of the advancement of human rights, and a period of serious illness led to the loss of support of his aristocratic sponsors and finally his fortune. Knigge found a measure of financial stability again with a position in Bremen in 1790. He died in Bremen in 1796.

In Germany, Knigge is best remembered for his book &quot;Über den Umgang mit Menschen&quot; (&quot;&quot;), a treatise on the fundamental principles of human relations that has the reputation of being the authoritative guide to behaviour, politeness, and etiquette. The work is more of a sociological and philosophical treatise on the basis of human relations than a how-to guide on etiquette, but the German word “Knigge” has come to mean “good manners” or books on etiquette.

<doc id="183297" wikidata="Q292960" url="?curid=183297" title="DC Talk">
<text>DC Talk (stylized as dc Talk) is a Christian rap and rock trio. The group was formed at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia in 1987 by Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait, and Kevin Max Smith. They released five major studio albums together: &quot;dc Talk&quot; (1989), &quot;Nu Thang&quot; (1990), &quot;Free at Last&quot; (1992), &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; (1995), and &quot;Supernatural&quot; (1998). In 2002, the &quot;Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music&quot; called dc Talk &quot;the most popular overtly Christian act of all time.&quot;

In 2001, the group released an EP, &quot;Solo&quot;, which contained two solo songs from each member. Since that time, DC Talk has been on an indefinite hiatus, and the three band members all have led solo careers and two have joined other groups. They performed and recorded individual songs together several times during the 2000s and 2010s, although the group never officially reunited or disbanded.

The group&#x27;s musical style evolved significantly throughout its career. Its first two releases, &quot;DC Talk&quot; and &quot;Nu Thang&quot;, were predominantly hip hop. Their third album, &quot;Free at Last&quot;, also mainly took influence from hip hop while the group&#x27;s music began to incorporate rock and other influences. The trio&#x27;s last two albums, &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; and &quot;Supernatural&quot;, were predominantly pop rock. They are currently on hiatus and no announcements of new albums have been made. In 2017, the band reunited for a cruise, and did so again in 2019.

==History==

===Formation===
While attending Liberty University, Toby McKeehan met Michael Tait, and the two began to perform together. Tait had previously been featured on Jerry Falwell&#x27;s &quot;The Old Time Gospel Hour&quot; and with the Falwell Singers. He also performed solo, what McKeehan later described as a &quot;kind of an R&amp;B/church-oriented music&quot;.

The two joined forces to record a song that McKeehan had written, &quot;Heavenbound&quot;. They performed the song before an audience of 8,000 Liberty students with McKeehan rapping and Tait singing the chorus. The song was well received, selling out the approximately 3,000 copies of their demo tape, &quot;Christian Rhymes to a Rhythm&quot;. The tape included &quot;Heavenbound&quot; and was distributed by the group in the Washington D.C. area.

Kevin Max Smith came from a campus rock band to join the group. Max was approached by Tait after performing The Imperials&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Harvest&quot; during a chapel session. The two became friends and Max was introduced to McKeehan. All three moved off campus to live together. 

In 1988, the group independently released their self titled album, a cassette only release. This album would be re-released by Forefront the following year.

The success of the group&#x27;s demo tape eventually led to a recording contract with Forefront Records in January 1989. Shortly after the signing of the recording contract the trio moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and called themselves &quot;DC Talk and the One Way Crew&quot;. The name was later simplified to &quot;DC Talk&quot;, which came to stand for &quot;decent Christian talk&quot;, though originally &quot;DC&quot; was taken from Washington, D.C., where Toby McKeehan had formerly been rapping.

===&quot;DC Talk&quot; (1989)===
After signing the recording contract with ForeFront, the trio released their self-titled debut album, &quot;DC Talk&quot;, in 1989 with Mike Valliere and Vic Mignogna. The music video for their first single, &quot;Heavenbound&quot;, received airplay on the BET network.

===&quot;Nu Thang&quot; (1990–1992)===
Their follow-up full-length release, &quot;Nu Thang&quot;, and a Christmas three-song EP titled &quot;Yo! Ho! Ho!&quot;, were both released in 1990. &quot;Nu Thang&quot; had two successful singles: &quot;I Luv Rap Music&quot; and &quot;Can I Get a Witness&quot;. Apart from dealing strictly with Christian themes, the band incorporated songs addressing social issues, such as racism in the song &quot;Walls&quot; and abortion in &quot;Children Can Live Without It&quot;. The hip hop/pop styling of the album earned the band attention, expanding the group&#x27;s audience, and by 1991, &quot;Nu Thang&quot; had sold 200,000 copies. The band became an opening act for Michael W. Smith and received a Dove Award. The release of their &quot;Rap, Rock, n&#x27; Soul &quot;video garnered a wider audience for the group, being certified gold for long form video.

In 1992, a year after its release, &quot;Nu Thang&quot; sold more than 300,000 copies and gave the trio two more Dove Awards. In addition to the increasing attention that the group began to receive, DC Talk appeared on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; that same year. &quot;Nu Thang&quot; was eventually certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies, an impressive feat for a Christian artist at that time.

===&quot;Free at Last&quot; (1992–1994)===
In November 1992, the group released their third album, &quot;Free at Last&quot;, which was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA in 1995. In 2001, CCM ranked &quot;Free at Last&quot; as the ninth best album in Christian music. The album included a cover version of the Bill Withers song &quot;Lean on Me&quot; and a remake of &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright&quot;, originally recorded by the Art Reynolds Singers. &quot;Free at Last&quot; stayed at the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; CCM sales chart for 34 weeks and was the band&#x27;s first album to top the Christian Albums chart. DC Talk became one of the first contemporary Christian groups to perform on late-night television when, on November 12, 1993, the band performed &quot;Jesus Is Just Alright&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jay Leno. &quot;Free at Last&quot; also garnered the group&#x27;s first Grammy Award for &quot;Best Rock Gospel Album&quot; in 1994. The success of the album is attributed to the group moving away from a strictly rap sound to a blend of hip hop and pop. The album also prompted the filming of a documentary film with the same name. In 1994, the band released a Christmas single, &quot;We Three Kings&quot;, on the album &quot;Joyful Christmas&quot;.

====&quot;Free at Last: The Movie&quot;====

During the &quot;Free at Last&quot; tour, the band was followed around by camera crews to film a documentary. The documentary was planned to be released as a theatrical film, &quot;Free at Last: The Movie&quot;, and was heavily promoted on Lightmusic TV, a Christian music video show. After months of teaser trailers, they abruptly stopped, because the movie could not find a distributor. Eight years after the film was to be released theatrically, the movie was finally released on DVD in unfinished form. Some of the footage used for the movie was shown in the music video for &quot;The Hardway&quot;.

===&quot;Jesus Freak&quot; (1995–1997)===
&quot;Jesus Freak&quot; was released in 1995, and it achieved the highest first-week sales of any Christian release at the time, reaching No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album, which was ultimately certified double platinum, was certified gold within 30 days of its release. This album was a fusion of musical stylings, with a more pop-rock oriented sound combined with hip hop.

&quot;Jesus Freak&quot; marked a milestone in the group&#x27;s commercial career, as they signed a deal with Virgin Records in 1996 to distribute their music to the mainstream market. It also earned DC Talk their second Grammy.

The title track is also of historical importance. It is believed to be the first link between grunge and rapcore in Contemporary Christian music, and was the first non–Adult Contemporary song to win the Dove Award for Song of the Year. The song was also played on some secular stations. &quot;Between You and Me&quot; was a successful single, reaching No. 24 and No. 29 respectively on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary and Hot 100 and No. 12 on Casey&#x27;s Top 40, while the video received regular airtime on MTV and VH1.

With the release of the album, the group launched a massive tour titled the &quot;Freakshow Tour&quot;, which took the trio across the United States, Canada, and Europe. The group released a live video titled &quot;Live in Concert: Welcome To The Freak Show&quot; which contained footage from the tour. An audio CD of the soundtrack from the video was also released under the same title, reaching No. 109 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The CD &quot;Welcome to the Freakshow&quot; was certified gold and won dc Talk another Grammy award.

The album is looked at by many as one of the greatest and most important albums to be released in Christian music.

===&quot;Supernatural&quot; (1998–2000)===
&quot;Supernatural&quot;, released in 1998, was their last all-new studio album. Upon release, the album overtook &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; to set a new record for the highest first week sales for a Christian release. It debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, an unprecedented feat for a Christian rock album. &quot;Supernatural&quot; abandoned the hip hop/rap style found on the group&#x27;s earlier releases to settle for the pop/rock sound. The group has stated in &quot;The Supernatural Experience&quot; video that this album was different; it was a collaborative effort of all three members. The singles for the album received their fair share of radio play on modern rock, contemporary Christian, and alternative outlets. The group then embarked on a 60-city tour across the United States titled, &quot;The Supernatural Experience&quot;. Footage from the tour was combined with interviews and released as &quot;The Supernatural Experience&quot; video and was certified gold for long form video.

In addition to touring and recording &quot;Supernatural&quot;, the members of the group went on to co-author a book titled &quot;Jesus Freaks&quot; in collaboration with The Voice of the Martyrs in 1999. The book contains the shortened biographies and incidents in the lives of famous and lesser-known Christians who stood up for their faith. Since then, the group has co-authored a series of other books.

In 2000, DC Talk hosted a show titled Intermission: A Decade of DC Talk. A compilation album titled &quot;&quot; was then released, containing many of their previously recorded songs either remixed or in their original formats. Two new songs, &quot;Chance&quot; and &quot;Sugar Coat It&quot;, were recorded for the album. &quot;Intermission&quot; reached No. 81 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

=== Continued success (2000–present) ===
In 2000, the members announced that they would be taking a break from the group to pursue solo efforts. They released &quot;Solo: Special Edition EP&quot;, which contained two new songs from each member&#x27;s solo ventures and a live version of the U2 song &quot;40&quot; performed by all three members. The EP reached No. 142 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and won DC Talk their fourth Grammy award.

During their hiatus, DC Talk has continued to sporadically release singles together, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; (2002), which was about the September 11 attacks. Multiple compilation albums have been released during their hiatus, including the 10th anniversary versions of their albums &quot;Free at Last&quot; (2002) and &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; (2006), as well as &quot;8 Great Hits&quot; (2004), &quot;Freaked!&quot; (2006), &quot;The Early Years&quot; (2006), &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2007), and &quot;Back 2 Back Hits&quot; (2011). The three members still frequently show up at each other&#x27;s shows and cover DC Talk songs. The band has also continued to help each other in their respective solo careers, including &quot;Atmosphere&quot; by tobyMac (2004), a cover of &quot;The Cross&quot; by Kevin Max (2007), and &quot;Love Feels Like&quot; by tobyMac (2015). Most recently, the band was featured on tobyMac&#x27;s single &quot;Space&quot; (2022).

Group members TobyMac and Michael Tait, with assistance from Christian organization WallBuilders, collaborated on two books: &quot;Under God&quot;, published in 2004, and &quot;Living Under God: Discovering Your Part in God&#x27;s Plan&quot;, published in 2005. Both books are collections of American history-inspired inspirational stories with a Christian perspective.

In 2010, the trio performed with Aaron Shust, Brandon Heath, Matthew West, Natalie Grant, Steven Curtis Chapman, Casting Crowns, and some other artists to serve as the backing choir for &quot;Come Together Now&quot;, a song about the 2010 Haiti earthquakes. Later in the year, Kevin Max admitted that he would love to make more DC Talk music, but he thinks &quot;that time has passed us by...&quot;. He then explained, &quot;as individuals we are so different in our approaches that it might be quite a process.&quot; tobyMac released the song &quot;Wonderin&#x27;&quot; with his album &quot;Tonight&quot;; the song is &quot;a warm look back at DC Talk&quot; for Toby. On October 11, 2016, the trio came together to perform &quot;Love Feels Like&quot; at the Allen Arena in Nashville, Tennessee for the 47th Annual GMA Dove Awards.

In 2015, Gotee Records announced the issuance of &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; and &quot;Supernatural&quot; on vinyl.

==== Reunion tour ====
In June 2010, Kevin Max tweeted that he was trying to arrange a reunion tour for &quot;perhaps&quot; 2011. In January 2011, TobyMac stated that a reunion tour would probably happen &quot;sooner or later&quot;, but not in the near future. In January 2014, Tait indicated that he liked the sound of a &quot;20-years-later&quot; tour in 2015, but tobyMac commented that &quot;nothing concrete is in the works&quot; due to conflicting schedules.

DC Talk performed two concerts on July 13, 2017, and a third show on July 14, 2017 aboard the MSC Divina in the Bahamas on the reunion cruise. The group hinted at more reunions in the future.

In June 2019, the group performed on a second cruise. Michael Tait stated in an interview that DC Talk would be doing a &quot;land cruise&quot; starting in 2020, which they did not.

<doc id="183301" wikidata="Q507410" url="?curid=183301" title="USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67)">
<text>USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; (CV-67) (formerly CVA-67), the only ship of her class, was an aircraft carrier, formerly of the United States Navy. Considered a supercarrier, she was a variant of the , and the last conventionally-powered carrier built for the Navy, as all carriers since have had nuclear propulsion. Commissioned in 1968, the ship was named after John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was originally designated a CVA, for fixed-wing attack carrier, however the designation was changed to CV, for fleet carrier.

After nearly 40 years of service, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was decommissioned on 1 August 2007. She was berthed at the NAVSEA Inactive Ships On-site Maintenance facility in Philadelphia, formerly the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, and, until late 2017, was available for donation as a museum and memorial to a qualified organization. In late 2017, the Navy revoked her &quot;donation hold&quot; status and designated her for dismantling.

On 16 January 2025, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; left the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and started the voyage to Brownsville, Texas where she will be scrapped. She arrived in Brownsville, TX on 2 February 2025 for her final arrival.

She has been succeeded by the Pre-Commissioning Unit , laid down in July 2015, launched in October 2019, and scheduled to enter service in 2025.

== Ship history ==

=== Design and early years ===
Designed under Ship Characteristics Board project SCB-127C, the ship&#x27;s keel was laid on inclined Shipway 8 by Newport News Shipbuilding on 22 October 1964. By 1965, the larger semi-submerged Shipway 11 became available, where final construction was completed. The ship was christened 27 May 1967 by Jacqueline Kennedy and her 9-year-old daughter, Caroline, two days short of what would have been President Kennedy&#x27;s 50th birthday. The ship entered service 7 September 1968.

&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; is a modified version of the earlier s. Originally scheduled to be the fourth &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;-class carrier, the ship received so many modifications during construction she formed her own class. The ship was originally ordered as a nuclear carrier, using the A3W reactor, but converted to conventional propulsion after construction had begun. The island is somewhat different from that of the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; class, with angled funnels to direct smoke and gases away from the flight deck. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; is also shorter than the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; class.

After an ORI (operational readiness inspection) conducted by Commander, Carrier Division Two, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; left for the Mediterranean in April 1969. The ship reached Rota, Spain on the morning of 22 April 1969 and relieved . Rear Admiral Pierre N. Charbonnet, Commander, Carrier Striking Forces, Sixth Fleet, and Commander, Carrier Striking Unit 60.1.9, shifted his flag to &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. The turnover complete by nightfall, the carrier, escorted by destroyers, transited the Strait of Gibraltar at the start of the mid watch on 22 April. The next day, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; refueled from , and acquired the company of a Soviet (Pennant No. 383).

=== 1970s ===

&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s maiden voyage, and several of her subsequent voyages, were on deployments to the Mediterranean during much of the 1970s to help deal with the steadily deteriorating situation in the Middle East. During the 1970s &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was upgraded to handle the F-14 Tomcat and the S-3 Viking.

&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was involved in the Navy response to the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East in October 1973, with her actions and the larger U.S. Navy picture being described in Elmo Zumwalt&#x27;s book &quot;On Watch&quot;.

In 1974, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet.

On 20 June 1975 &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was the target of possible arson, suffering eight fires, with no injuries, while at port in Norfolk, Virginia.

On 22 November 1975, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; collided with the cruiser , severely damaging the smaller ship. As a result of the collision with &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s overhanging deck, JP-5 fuel lines were ruptured spraying fuel over an adjacent catwalk, and fires ensued aboard both ships. &quot;Belknap&quot;″s superstructure was gutted almost to the main deck, and seven of her crew killed. Aboard &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, smoke inhalation claimed the life of Yeoman 2nd Class David A. Chivalette of VF-14, CVW-1.

On 14 September 1976, while conducting a nighttime underway replenishment north of Scotland, the destroyer lost control and collided with &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, resulting in such severe damage to the destroyer that she was removed from service in 1977. Earlier the same day, one F-14 Tomcat, following a problem with the catapult, fell off of the flight deck of &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, with AIM-54 Phoenix missiles in international waters, off the coast of Scotland. Both crew members ejected and landed on the deck, injured but alive. A naval race (surface and submarine) followed between the Soviet Navy and U.S. Navy to get back not only the plane (because of its weapon system), but also its missiles. After a prolonged search, the U.S. Navy retrieved the aircraft and its missiles.

In 1979 &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; underwent her first year-long overhaul, which was completed in 1980. While the carrier was at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia for the overhaul, arson attacks were carried out on the ship on two occasions. On 9 April 1979, she experienced five fires which killed one shipyard worker and injured 34 others, and on 5 June 1979 the carrier was the target of two more fires; no one was injured in the latter incident.
In 1979 she won her second Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award.

=== 1980s ===

On 4 August 1980, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; left Norfolk, Virginia and voyaged to the Mediterranean Sea.
On 4 January 1982, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, with Carrier Air Wing Three (AC), sailed as the flagship for Carrier Group Four (CCG-4) from Norfolk, Va. on her ninth deployment, and her first visit to the Indian Ocean after port visits to St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Malaga, Spain, and transiting the Suez Canal. In her time in the Indian Ocean &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; conducted her only port visit to Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia, anchoring in Gage Roads on 19 March 1982 for a R&amp;R visit, departing on 25 March back to the Indian Ocean. During this time &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; played host to the first visit of the Somali head of state, President Mohammed Siad Barre. Her cruise ended with port visits to Mombasa, Kenya and Toulon, France, and another visit to Malaga, Spain before returning home on 14 July 1982.

In October 1983 &quot;John F. Kennedy,&quot; with Commander, Carrier Group 6 (CCG-6) embarked, was diverted to Beirut, Lebanon from her planned Indian Ocean deployment, after the Beirut barracks bombing killed 241 U.S. military personnel taking part in the Multinational Force in Lebanon, and spent the rest of that year and early 1984 patrolling the region. On 4 December 1983 ten A-6 aircraft from &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; along with A-6 and A-7 aircraft from took part in a bombing raid over Beirut, in response to two U.S. F-14 aircraft being fired upon the previous day. The Navy lost two aircraft during the raid: an A-7E from &quot;Independence&quot; and an A-6E from &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; were shot down by SAMs. The A-7E pilot was picked up by a fishing boat, but the A-6E pilot Lt. Mark Lange died after ejecting and the B/N Lt. Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Goodman was taken prisoner and released on 3 January 1984.

In 1984 the ship was drydocked at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a one-and-a-half-year complex overhaul and upgrades.

In 1985 &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; received the initial awarding of the Department of Defense Phoenix Award for Maintenance Excellence for having the best maintenance department in the entire Department of Defense.

Setting sail in July 1986, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; participated in the International Naval Review to help mark the Re-dedication of the Statue of Liberty. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; served as the flagship for the armada before departing on her eleventh overseas deployment to the Mediterranean in Augusthighlighted by multiple Freedom of Navigation exercises in the Gulf of Sidra, and operations off of the coast of Lebanon as a response to increasing terrorist activities and U.S. citizens being taken hostage in Beirut. The ship returned to Norfolk, Virginia in March 1987 and was dry-docked a second time for fifteen months for critical upgrades and major repairs.

In August 1988 &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; departed on her twelfth overseas deployment. During this deployment, a pair of MiG-23 Flogger fighter aircraft from Libya approached the carrier task force, which was off the shore of Libya near the declared Libyan territorial waters of the Gulf of Sidra. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; launched two F-14 Tomcats from VF-32 &quot;Fighting Swordsmen&quot; to intercept the incoming MiGs. The U.S. planes were sent to escort the MiGs away from the task force. During the course of the intercept, the MiGs were determined to be hostile and were both shot down.

=== 1990s ===
&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; returned to the U.S. in time to participate in Fleet Week in New York and Independence Day celebrations in Boston, Massachusetts before receiving an &quot;All-hands&quot; recall on 10 August 1990, for Operation Desert Shield. The ship was empty of fuel, and ordnance and equipment as she was ready to join the yards for some SRA maintenance. Once the Warning order was issued, the ship went into 24-hour supplies replenishment procedures. She took on all the supplies and equipment she had just been offloading. She took on additional fuel and ordnance while crossing the Atlantic Ocean. She departed the United States combat ready faster than any ship had accomplished since the Vietnam War. She departed on 15 August 1990, and became the flagship for the commander of the Red Sea Battle Force. At midnight on 17 January 1991 &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s Carrier Air Wing 3 commenced the first strike operations against Iraqi forces as part of Operation Desert Storm. Between the commencement of the operation and the cease-fire, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; launched 114 airstrikes and nearly 2,900 sorties against Iraq, which delivered over 3.5 million pounds of . On 27 February 1991 President George H. W. Bush declared a cease-fire in Iraq, and ordered all U.S. forces to stand down. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was relieved, and began the long journey home by transiting the Suez Canal. She arrived in Norfolk on 28 March 1991.

While at Norfolk the ship was placed on a four-month selective restricted-availability period as shipyard workers carried out maintenance. Extensive repairs to the flight deck, maintenance and engineering systems were made. Additionally, the ship was refitted to handle the new F/A-18C/D Hornet.

With the upgrades completed, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; departed on her 14th deployment to the Mediterranean, assisting several task forces with workup exercises in anticipation of intervention in Yugoslavia. When &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; returned she was sent to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she underwent a two-year extensive overhaul. Upon completion of the overhaul the ship was transferred to the Mayport Naval Station near Jacksonville, Florida, which remained the ship&#x27;s home port.

On 1 October 1995, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was designated to be an operational reserve carrier and Naval Reserve Force ship with a combined full-time active duty and part-time Naval Reserve crew complement, assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; would be available to deploy with either an active or reserve carrier air wing when mobilized in support of urgent operational requirements. In this capacity, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s new primary function would be to provide a surge capability, and in peacetime, to support training requirements. She would participate in routine fleet exercises, aviator carrier qualifications, and battle group training. The impetus for this initiative was post-Cold War defense spending in the mid-1990s, however, the Naval Reserve was never adequately funded to accomplish major maintenance actions for &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;, further exacerbated by additional defense cutbacks that eliminated Carrier Air Wing Reserve 30 and the downgrading of Carrier Air Wing Reserve 20 to a non-deployable Tactical Support Wing and the return of many of the Reserve&#x27;s front-line combat aircraft to the active duty force. Following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States, the Operational Reserve Carrier concept was discontinued and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was returned to the active duty fleet and placed back in the same maintenance rotation as active duty carriers.

&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; made a high-profile visit to Dublin, Ireland during an Atlantic deployment in 1996. Here, more than 10,000 people were invited to tour the ship at anchor in Dublin Bay. The visit was also intended to honor two personalities who had made a great impact on history: John F. Kennedy, for whom the ship was named, and Commodore John Barry, a native of County Wexford, Ireland who played an instrumental role in the early years of the United States Navy. Officers and crew from &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; joined local military and civilian organizations in celebrating Barry&#x27;s achievements at his statue in Crescent Quay, Wexford, and three F-14 Tomcat fighters flew at low level over the town. Jean Kennedy Smith, sister of John F. Kennedy, was the U.S. ambassador to Ireland at the time, and was among those who welcomed the ship to Ireland.

During her visit to Ireland, high winds in Dublin Bay caused the boarding pontoon to tear a large hole in &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s hull.

&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s 15th Mediterranean deployment included two transits of the Suez Canal, and four months deployed in the Persian Gulf. One night in the Gulf two Iranian F-14&#x27;s were flying low altitude at high speed heading toward the ship. The AEGIS cruiser acquired the jets on radar and warned them to turn away, which they did. She returned in time to participate in Fleet Week &#x27;98 in New York City.

Shortly before &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s 16th deployment, she became involved in a rescue mission when the tug &quot;Gulf Majesty&quot; foundered during Hurricane Floyd in mid-September 1999. The ship successfully rescued the crew of the vessel, then headed toward the Middle East, where she became the first U.S. aircraft carrier to make a port call in Al Aqabah, Jordan, in the process playing host to the King of Jordan, before taking up station in support of Operation Southern Watch.

&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was the only conventionally powered U.S. carrier underway at the end of 1999, arriving back at Mayport on 19 March 2000. After a brief period of maintenance (Advanced combat direction system was installed), the carrier sailed north to participate in 4 July International Naval Review, then headed to Boston for Sail Boston 2000. The City of Boston arranged this independent event to take advantage of the transit of Tall sailing ships participating in Operation Sail 2000 as they passed by from New London, Connecticut en route to their final port-of-call in Portland, Maine.

=== 2000s ===

During &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s last round of refits the ship became a testbed for an experimental system for the Cooperative Engagement Capability, a system that allowed &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; to engage targets beyond original range.

In 2001, during a pre-deployment trial, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was found to be severely deficient in some respects, especially those relating to air group operations; most problematic, two aircraft catapults and three aircraft elevators, which are used to lift aircraft from the hangar deck to and from the flight deck, were non-functional during inspection, and two boilers would not light. As a result, her captain and two department heads were relieved for cause.

As the 11 September attacks of 2001 unfolded, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; and her battle group were ordered to support Operation Noble Eagle, establishing air security along the mid-Atlantic seaboard, including Washington, D.C. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was released from Noble Eagle on 14 September 2001.

During the first six months of 2002, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; aircraft dropped 31,000 tons of ordnance on Taliban and al Qaeda targets in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
In August 2002, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; visited the city of Tarragona in Spain.

In July 2004 &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; collided with a dhow in the Persian Gulf, leaving no survivors on the traditional Arab sailing boat. After the incident the Navy relieved the commanding officer of &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;. The carrier herself was unscathed, but two jet fighters on the deck were damaged when an F-14B Tomcat assigned to VF-103 slid into an F/A-18C Hornet assigned to VFA-81 damaging the wing of the F-14 as well as the upper section of the radome and forward windscreen of the F/A-18 as the ship made a hard turn to avoid the tiny vessel. A popular misconception is that &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s captain waited to make the turn at the last possible moment to recover aircraft critically low on fuel returning from airstrikes. The official review board determined this was not the case and the aircraft could have remained safely aloft until &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; maneuvered to avoid the dhow.

&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was the most costly carrier in the fleet to maintain and was due for an expensive overhaul; budget cutbacks and changing naval tactics
prompted the U.S. Navy to decide to retire her. On 1 April 2005 the Navy formally announced that the carrier&#x27;s scheduled 15-month overhaul had been cancelled.
Before decommissioning she made a number of port calls to allow the public to &quot;say farewell&quot; to her, including a stop at her &quot;homeport&quot; Boston Harbor. &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; also took part in the 2005 New York City Fleet Week festivities at the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum. She was decommissioned in Mayport, Florida on 23 March 2007.

The ship&#x27;s unique in-port cabin, which was decorated by Jacqueline Kennedy with wood paneling, oil paintings, and rare artifacts, was disassembled, to be rebuilt at the National Museum of Naval Aviation at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.
Ex-&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; was towed to Norfolk, Virginia on 26 July 2007. She remained in Norfolk until a shoaled area near Pier 4 in Philadelphia could be dredged to enable the ship to safely dock. On 17 March 2008 at about 1700, she was seen leaving Norfolk Naval Station under tow of the tug &quot;Atlantic Salvor&quot;. On 22 March 2008 ex-&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; arrived, with the afternoon high tide, at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia.

=== Retirement ===
In November 2009, the Navy placed &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; on donation hold for use as a museum and memorial. A report in the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; newspaper on 26 November 2009 mentioned the possibility of bringing &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; to the Boston, Massachusetts area, as a museum or memorial at no cost to the city, if desired.

In August 2010, two groups successfully passed into Phase II of the U.S. Navy Ship Donation Program:
*Rhode Island Aviation Hall of Fame, Providence, Rhode Island
* USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; Museum, Portland, Maine
On 4 January 2010, Portland, Maine City Council unanimously endorsed the efforts of the USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; Museum while Gov. John Baldacci also offered his support. One year later on 19 January 2011 the Portland, Maine City Council voted 9–0 to not continue with the project to bring the ship to Maine.

Plans as of September 2014 had the Rhode Island Aviation Hall of Fame working to secure Pier 2 of the Naval Station Newport. These developments come after the former was sold for scrapping earlier after years of being moored in Newport.
With the advent of the nuclear carrier, and &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; were the last two candidate carriers to become museum ships as they have conventional propulsion. Nuclear carriers, such as and the , require extensive deconstruction to remove their nuclear reactors during decommissioning, leaving them in an unsuitable condition for donation. In October 2017, it was announced that &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; would be disposed of by scrapping, leaving &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; the last available carrier capable of conversion to a museum.

In late 2017, the Navy revoked &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;″s &quot;donation hold&quot; status and designated her for dismantling. There were still several groups, from Florida, Maine and Rhode Island, with the assistance of the USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; Veteran&#x27;s Association, hoping to persuade the Navy to reinstate the &quot;donation hold&quot; status, while they pursued the goal of obtaining her as a museum.

On 6 October 2021, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; and &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; were sold for one cent each to International Shipbreaking Limited.

On 16 January 2025, &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; started the voyage to Brownsville, Texas where it will be scrapped. The carrier arrived on 2 February.

== In popular culture ==
The TV series &quot;Supercarrier&quot; was partially filmed on board the ship between September and November 1987, while the ship was undergoing a period of upkeep.

<text>Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional heavy metal with speed metal, often within a symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a faster, lighter, and more uplifting sound, in contrast with the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in, for example, extreme metal. Power metal bands usually have anthemic songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally &quot;powerful&quot; sound.

The term was first used in the mid-1980s and refers to two different but related styles:
* the first largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal;
* a later, more widespread and popular style based in Europe with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.

==Stylistic origins==
Anthropologist Sam Dunn traced the origins of power metal back to the late 1970s, when the groundwork for power metal lyrical style was laid down by Ronnie James Dio. The fantasy-oriented lyrics he wrote for Rainbow, concentrated around medieval, renaissance, folk, and science fiction themes, directly influenced modern power metal bands. According to Dunn, the songs &quot;Stargazer&quot; and &quot;A Light in the Black&quot; from the 1976 album &quot;Rising&quot;, as well as &quot;Kill the King&quot; and &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; from the 1978 album &quot;Long Live Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, might be among the earliest examples of power metal. In his 2011 documentary series &quot;Metal Evolution&quot;, Dunn further explained how Rob Halford of Judas Priest created a blueprint for power metal vocal delivery. His almost constant high-pitched singing became one of the main characteristics of power metal. The twin-guitar sound promoted by Judas Priest&#x27;s duo of K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton also highly influenced this subgenre.

Another British band, Iron Maiden, brought epic and melodic sensibility to metal, creating anthemic, singalong music, an approach widely embraced by modern power metal musicians. Referred to as the &quot;main prototype&quot; of the power metal genre, Iron Maiden was heavily influenced by &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; and &quot;Mob Rules&quot; (the first two albums of Black Sabbath&#x27;s Dio-era), which would also go on to influence modern power metal.

The emergence of the early German power metal scene in particular was made possible by Scorpions and Accept. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen made a significant impact on many future power metal guitarists, with his accurate and fast neo-classical style. His bandmate Jens Johansson modernized the keyboard sound of Deep Purple&#x27;s Jon Lord, which was further incorporated into the genre. Manowar&#x27;s mythological sword and sorcery lyrics influenced a number of power metal bands.

Throughout the early 1980s (especially during 1982 and 1983), the US power metal style first emerged from traditional heavy metal, the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM), and thrash/speed metal backgrounds. Although the genre&#x27;s precise stylistic origins are often contested, acts such as Cirith Ungol, Jag Panzer, Manilla Road, Omen, Riot, Savatage, and Warlord are generally believed to have influenced the earliest development of the style.

More concretely, in 1987 German band Helloween released their second album, &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I&quot;, cited by AllMusic as &quot;a landmark recording that remains arguably the single most influential power metal album to date. Its volatile combination of power and melody would inspire an entire generation of metal bands&quot;. This release influenced a European power metal style to evolve, which proliferated throughout the globe and since the start of the 1990s is still the most commonly heard style of power metal.

==Musical characteristics==
Power metal &quot;bears all the hallmarks of traditional metal&quot; is today associated with fast guitar riffs and drumming, twin melodies, operatic singing. The sound is tempered by characteristics of speed metal, power metal&#x27;s musical forerunner.

===Vocals===
Power metal is highly focused on the vocalist, with &quot;clean&quot; vocals being much more prevalent than the growling vocals often associated with extreme metal. Inspired by Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, Geoff Tate, and other heavy metal vocalists, power metal vocals are often in a high register, and the singer&#x27;s vocal range is usually wide. The majority of the genre&#x27;s vocalists sing in the tenor range and are capable of hitting very high notes, for example Timo Kotipelto of Stratovarius, Tony Kakko of Sonata Arctica, Michael Kiske (Helloween) and Andre Matos (ex-Angra). There are many exceptions who sing in either baritone or bass range, like Joakim Brodén of Sabaton. Some vocalists sing in a harsh, thrash metal style, including Chris Boltendahl of Grave Digger, Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Peavy Wagner of Rage, and Wintersun&#x27;s Jari Mäenpää. Many power metal vocalists record multi-layered vocals, creating a choral effect.

===Lyrical themes===
Themes that frequently feature throughout other metal subgenres, such as religion and politics, are comparatively rare in power metal - albeit not unheard of. Power metal&#x27;s lyrical themes often focus on fantasy and mythology, camaraderie and hope, personal struggles and emotions, war and death, or combinations of the aforementioned. For example, Finnish band Sonata Arctica have been known for focusing their lyrics of their songs on fantasy but also have many songs based on reality, love and relationships.

Many power metal bands based their concept albums on fantasy books and national epics; Blind Guardian based &quot;Nightfall in Middle-Earth&quot; on Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, while Kamelot based &quot;Epica&quot; and &quot;The Black Halo&quot; on Goethe&#x27;s Faust. Some bands have even written their own imaginary stories, like Rhapsody of Fire&#x27;s &quot;Emerald Sword Saga&quot; and &quot;The Dark Secret Saga&quot;, Iced Earth&#x27;s &quot;Something Wicked Saga&quot;, or &quot;Avantasia&quot; by Edguy&#x27;s Tobias Sammet.

Historical themes have also seen usage in the works of bands, most famously Sabaton, whose lyrics extensively focus on historical wars, battles, and individuals that received notable recognition for their wartime accomplishments. Examples include World War I, World War II, Vikings, Samurai, and much more from around the world including the American, Swedish and German militaries. Serenity, an Austrian (symphonic) power metal band, focuses mainly on historical figures and events, including Sir Francis Drake, Marco Polo, Galileo, Beethoven, and Napoleon.

Contrary to traditional power metal music, Powerwolf focuses on Transylvanian werewolf and vampire legends and dark myths. The lyrics of the band are characterized by the treatment of Christianity and ancient Romanian legends. Powerwolf, however, do not consider themselves a religious band, but rather call themselves spiritual.

===Instrumentation===

Power metal guitarists and bassists generally play rapid streams of notes, but change chords comparatively slowly, with a harmonic tempo of once per measure or slower. Fast and technically demanding guitar solos, however, are almost guaranteed. The slow changing of chords is significant in defining power metal just as the fast rapid chord changes often define traditional thrash metal. Power metal often makes use of Major chord progressions as well as circle progressions. Some of the most influential and acclaimed power metal guitarists are Kai Hansen of Gamma Ray, Michael Weikath of Helloween, and Timo Tolkki formerly of Stratovarius. It is a common trait in power metal for the bass guitar to take a back seat, so to speak; often simply providing the chord root notes and being drowned out by the more prevalent rhythm guitars. However, some power metal bands incorporate bass that is more audible with colorful patterns distinct from the rhythm guitars, such as Helloween, Hibria, and Symphony X.

Many power metal drummers play double bass patterns with either two bass drums, or utilize a double bass pedal; using them to play a constant stream of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) with snare drum accents on the beat, a style not restricted to, but most often associated with, power metal. The style was used by drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg of Helloween, setting a blueprint for many other drummers to follow. Others, such as the drummers of Blind Guardian and Iced Earth, use a more thrash metal style of drumming with rapid bursts of double bass that involve three to six beats with the double kick.

Power metal bands often incorporate keyboards into their musical arrangements, something popularized by Jens Johansson of Stratovarius (though their prominence varies). Some power metal bands also record with symphonic elements, and as such, they utilize a full orchestra to fill the role usually played by the keyboardist.

==Styles==

===American style===

The American branch of power metal emerged in early 1980s in the United States, drawing influence primarily from traditional metal and the NWOBHM. Though very close to its roots, US power metal (often abbreviated USPM) is often faster and more energetic than traditional heavy metal, with a more riff-driven approach and a relative lack of keyboard usage compared to its later European counterpart. However, it is often more melodic than thrash metal, with a greater emphasis on guitar leads. USPM is also notable for its widespread (but not universal) use of high-register operatic vocals, a trend which would continue with the rise of European power metal in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This style is not exclusive to North America, as European bands such as Sacred Steel, Majesty, and Australian band Pegazus later adopted a style inspired by USPM bands in the 1990s.

The early releases of progressive metal bands Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, such as &quot;The Warning&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Spectre Within&quot; (1985), heavily influenced a number of bands that were to develop a common sound towards the late 1980s. Among the better known representatives of the style, such as Manowar, Vicious Rumors, Virgin Steele, Riot, or Jag Panzer, a small number of bands enriched their sound with progressive and epic elements (the most obvious examples being Crimson Glory, Savatage, Sanctuary and the epic doom metal band Cirith Ungol); or even with thrash metal elements, e.g., Iced Earth. US power metal saw a sharp decline in popularity at the beginning of the 1990s, though the style has rebounded somewhat in the past decade, with bands such as Liege Lord or Heir Apparent reforming for live performances and many, such as Helstar and Omen, still releasing new material.

===European style===

European power metal originated from speed metal and the NWOBHM, emerging in late 1980s, particularly in Germany, with Helloween, Running Wild, Rage, Grave Digger, and Blind Guardian. The second and third Helloween albums; &quot;Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I&quot; (1987) and &quot;Part II&quot; (1988) are usually considered the first proper European power metal albums. Alongside the early German bands came Finland&#x27;s Stratovarius in late 1980s. These bands pioneered the genre, but took it in somewhat different directions. Helloween, followed by early Gamma Ray, mixed fast palm muted speed metal riffs with high-pitched clean vocals, and with a strong focus on melody and uplifting, positive themes. Stratovarius further developed this melodic direction by making heavy use of keyboards, with lyrics dealing with emotions and personal issues. Blind Guardian utilized the technique of vocal and guitar overdubbing to create an epic atmosphere, with lyrical content strongly based on fantasy novels, myths and legends. The symphonic and neo-classical elements also found their way through power metal with bands like Rhapsody of Fire (Italy), Serenity (Austria) and Nightwish (Finland). At the same time, bands such as HammerFall simplified their power metal to bring it closer to traditional heavy metal.

Over the late 90s and early 00s, power metal spread over Europe especially as well as the rest of the world, often incorporating new influences. Italy&#x27;s Elvenking, Sweden&#x27;s Falconer, Spain&#x27;s Mägo de Oz, and Denmark&#x27;s Wuthering Heights integrated elements of folk music with power metal. Angra, Kamelot, and especially Symphony X are known for combining progressive and power metal. Some bands are known for combining power metal with more aggressive musical forms; Children of Bodom were one of the earliest who combined elements of power metal and an early form of melodic death metal.

European-style power metal became widespread in comparison with US style as of the mid 1990s, with numerous North American bands such as Theocracy, Borealis, Forgotten Tales, Avian, Pharaoh, Circle II Circle, and Kamelot demonstrating the style. This European style of power metal is sometimes considered the &quot;second wave&quot; of power metal since its spread was in the late 1980s and especially the mid-late 1990s rather than proliferating throughout the 1980s, and the widespread influence and development of the genre that came in its tow while US &quot;first wave&quot; style markedly declined.

<text>Dub is a musical style that grew out of reggae in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is commonly considered a subgenre of reggae, though it has developed to extend beyond that style. Generally, dub consists of remixes of existing recordings created by significantly manipulating the original, usually through the removal of vocal parts, emphasis of the rhythm section (the stripped-down drum-and-bass track is sometimes referred to as a riddim), the application of studio effects such as echo and reverb, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works.
Dub was pioneered by recording engineers and producers such as Osbourne &quot;King Tubby&quot; Ruddock, Hopeton &quot;Scientist&quot; Brown, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, Errol Thompson and others beginning in the late 1960s. Augustus Pablo, who collaborated with many of these producers, is credited with bringing the distinct-sounding melodica to dub, and is also among the pioneers and creators of the genre. Similar experiments with recordings at the mixing desk outside the dancehall scene were also done by producers Clive Chin and Herman Chin Loy. These producers, especially Ruddock and Perry, looked upon the mixing console as an instrument, manipulating tracks to come up with something new and different. The Roland Space Echo was widely used by dub producers in the 1970s to produce echo and delay effects. 

Dub has influenced many genres of music, including rock, most significantly the subgenre of post-punk and other kinds of punk, pop, hip hop, post-disco, and later house, techno, ambient, electronic dance music, and trip hop. Dub was a basis for the genres of jungle and drum and bass, as well as a major influence on dubstep, with its orientation around bass and utilization of audio effects. Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators such as Mad Professor continue to produce new material.

==Name==
The use of the word &quot;dub&quot; in a recording context originated in the late 1920s with the advent of &quot;talking pictures&quot; and referred to adding a soundtrack to a film; it is an informal abbreviation of the word &quot;double&quot;. Over the next 40 years or so the term found its way into audio recording in general, often in the context of making a copy of a recording on another tape or disc.

It was in this sense that the term was first used in the Jamaican recording industry: new recordings were often initially copied onto one-off acetate discs, known colloquially as &quot;soft wax&quot; or &quot;dub&quot; and later as dubplates, for exclusive use by sound system operators; playing a song as an exclusive recording on a sound system was a good way for a producer to test the potential popularity of a recording before committing to the pressing of hundreds or thousands of copies of singles for retail sale. Initially, these acetates would simply be the standard recording of a song that was yet to be released on a single; around 1968–69, however, they started to be exclusive mixes with some or all of the vocal mixed out. Producer Bunny Lee notes:

&quot;Yeah...it was really VERSION those days – it wasn&#x27;t dub yet beca&#x27; it was jus&#x27; the riddim. One day an incident: Ruddy&#x27;s (sound system operator Ruddy Redwood) was &quot;cutting dub&quot;, an when it start, Smithy (recording engineer Byron Smith) look like &#x27;im start bring on the voice and Ruddy&#x27;s say: no, mek it run and &#x27;im take the whole backing track off it. &#x27;Im say, alright, run it again, and put in the voice. &#x27;Im didn&#x27;t do no more like that yet.&quot;

After describing how Redwood then had his deejay first play the vocal version and then the instrumental version at a dance, and how popular this novelty was, Lee continued:

&quot;The next day now, &#x27;im start it and just bring in the riddim. Or...down in the tune, bring a little voice and drop it out again...yes. Ruddy use to handle that part himself, drop in the voice and drop it out. All Smithy do was &quot;cut the dub...&quot;&quot;

Jamaican soundsystems had always sought exclusive recordings from their origins in the late 1940s. However, when they played American rhythm &amp; blues records through the 1950s, these were simply records that rival sound system operators didn&#x27;t have and couldn&#x27;t identify. This progressed from the late 1950s onwards via having local musicians record a song exclusively for play on a particular sound system to having exclusive mixes of a song on acetate, which became possible with the arrival of multi-track recording in Jamaica. From the concept of a version with some or all of the vocal mixed out dubbed to acetate, the novelty-hungry sound system scene rapidly drove the evolution of increasingly creative mixes in the first few years of the 1970s. Within a few years the term dub became attached to these regardless of whether they were on an exclusive acetate or &quot;dubplate&quot;. As the use of the term widened and evolved, Bob Marley and The Wailers used the order &quot;&quot;dub&quot; this one!&quot; in live concerts to mean, &quot;put an emphasis on bass and drums&quot;. Drummer Sly Dunbar similarly points to a usage of the related term &quot;dubwise&quot; to mean using only drums and bass.

It is possible that the existing use of the word dub for other meanings in Jamaica around the time of the music&#x27;s origin may have helped to cement its use in the musical context. The most frequent meanings referred to either a form of erotic dance or sexual intercourse; such usage is frequently present in names of reggae songs, for instance, of The Silvertones&#x27; &quot;Dub the Pum Pum&quot; (where &quot;pum pum&quot; is Jamaican slang for female genitalia), Big Joe and Fay&#x27;s &quot;Dub a Dawta&quot; ( is Jamaican patois for &quot;&quot;). I-Roy&#x27;s &quot;Sister Maggie Breast&quot; features several references on sex:
I man a-&quot;dub&quot; it on the side&lt;br&gt;
Say little sister you can run but you can&#x27;t hide&lt;br&gt;
Slip you got to slide you got to open your crotches wide&lt;br&gt;
Peace and love abide

However, all three of these songs were recorded after the use of &quot;dub&quot; for a style of remixing was already prevalent.

==Characteristics==

According to David Toop, &quot;Dub music is like a long echo delay, looping through time...turning the rational order of musical sequences into an ocean of sensation.&quot;

Dub music is characterized by a &quot;version&quot; or &quot;double&quot; of an existing song, often instrumental, initially almost always pressed on the B-sides of Jamaican 45 rpm records and typically emphasizing the drums and bass for a sound popular in local sound systems. A &quot;version&quot; is an alternative cut of a song made for the DJ to &quot;toast&quot; over (a form of Jamaican rapping), usually with some or all of the original vocal removed. These &quot;versions&quot; were used as the basis of new songs by rerecording them with new elements. The instrumental tracks are typically treated with sound effects such as echo, reverb, with instruments and vocals dropping in and out of the mix. The partial or total removal of vocals and other instruments tends to emphasise the bass guitar. The music sometimes features other noises, such as birds singing, thunder and lightning, water flowing, and producers shouting instructions at the musicians. It can be further augmented by live DJs. The many-layered sounds with varying echoes and volumes are often said to create soundscapes, or sound sculptures, drawing attention to the shape and depth of the space between sounds as well as to the sounds themselves. There is usually a distinctly organic feel to the music, even though the effects are electronically created.

Often these tracks are used for &quot;toasters&quot; rapping heavily rhymed and alliterative lyrics. These are called &quot;DJ Versions&quot;. In forms of sound system–based reggae, the performer using a microphone is referred to as the &quot;DJ&quot; or &quot;deejay&quot; (where in other genres, this performer might be termed the &quot;MC&quot;, meaning &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot;, or alternately, the later developed slang terms: &quot;Microphone Commander&quot; or &quot;Mic Control&quot;), and the person choosing the music and operating the turntables is called the &quot;selector&quot; (sometimes referred to as the DJ in other genres).

A major reason for producing multiple versions was economic; a record producer could use a recording he owned to produce numerous versions from a single studio session. A version was also an opportunity for a producer or remix engineer to experiment and express their more creative side. The version was typically the B-side of a single, and used for experimenting and providing something for DJs to talk over, while the A-side was more often dedicated to the original vocal-oriented track. In the 1970s, LPs of dub tracks began to be produced; these could be, variously: a collection of new dub mixes of riddims previously used on various singles, usually by a single producer; the dub version of an existing vocal LP with dub mixes of all the tracks; or, least commonly, a selection of previously unissued original riddims mixed in a dub style.

==History==
Dub music and toasting introduced a new era of creativity in reggae music. From their beginning, toasting and dub music developed together and influenced each other. The development of sound system culture influenced the development of studio techniques in Jamaica, and the earliest DJs, including Duke Reid and Prince Buster among others, were toasting over instrumental versions of reggae and developing instrumental reggae music.

===&quot;Versions&quot; and experiments with studio mixing (Late 1960s)===
In 1968, Kingston, Jamaica sound system operator Rudolph &quot;Ruddy&quot; Redwood went to Duke Reid&#x27;s Treasure Isle studio to cut a one-off dub plate of The Paragons hit &quot;On The Beach&quot;. Engineer Byron Smith left the vocal track out by accident, but Redwood kept the result and played it at his next dance with his deejay Wassy toasting over the rhythm. The instrumental record excited the people at the sound system and they started singing lyrics of the vocal track over the instrumental. The invention was a success, and Ruddy needed to play the instrumental continuously for half an hour to an hour that day. The next day Bunny Lee who was a witness to this, told King Tubby that they needed to make some more instrumental tracks, as &quot;them people love&quot; them, and they dubbed out vocals from &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud To Beg&quot; by Slim Smith. Because of King Tubby&#x27;s innovative approach, the resulting instrumental track was more than just a track without a voice – King Tubby interchanged the vocals and the instrumental, playing the vocals first, then playing the riddim, then mixing them together. From this point on, they started to call such tracks &quot;versions&quot;. Another source puts 1967 and not 1968 as the initial year of the practice of putting instrumental versions of reggae tracks to the B-side of records.

At Studio One the initial motivation to experiment with instrumental tracks and studio mixing was correcting the riddim until it had a &quot;feel,&quot; so a singer, for instance, could comfortably sing over it.

Another reason to experiment with mixing was rivalry among sound systems. Sound systems&#x27; sound men wanted the tracks they played at dances to be slightly different each time, so they would order numerous copies of the same record from a studio, each with a different mix.

===Evolution of dub as a subgenre (1970s)===
By 1973, through the efforts of several independent and competitive innovators, engineers, and producers, instrumental reggae &quot;versions&quot; from various studios had evolved into &quot;dub&quot; as a subgenre of reggae.

The innovative album &quot;The Undertaker&quot; by Derrick Harriott and the Crystallites, engineered by Errol Thompson and with &quot;Sound Effects&quot; credited to Derrick Harriott, was one of the first strictly instrumental reggae albums on its release in 1970.

In 1973, at least three producers, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and the Aquarius studio engineer/producer team of Herman Chin Loy and Errol Thompson simultaneously recognized that there was an active market for this new &quot;dub&quot; sound and consequently they started to release the first albums strictly consisting of dub. In the spring of 1973, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry released &quot;Upsetters 14 Dub Blackboard Jungle&quot;, mixed in collaboration with King Tubby and more commonly known as &quot;Blackboard Jungle Dub&quot;. It is considered a landmark recording of this genre.

In 1974, Keith Hudson released his classic &quot;Pick a Dub&quot;, widely considered to have been the first deliberately thematic dub album, with tracks specifically mixed in the dub style for the purpose of appearing together on an LP, and King Tubby released his two debut albums &quot;At the Grass Roots of Dub&quot; and &quot;Surrounded by the Dreads at the National Arena&quot;.

===Dub history (since the early 1980s)===
Dub has continued to evolve, its popularity waxing and waning with changes in musical fashion. Almost all reggae singles still carry an instrumental version on the B-side and these are still used by the sound systems as a blank canvas for live singers and DJs.

In 1986, the Japanese band Mute Beat would create dub music using live instruments such as trumpets rather than studio equipment, and became a precursor to club music.

In the 1980s, the United Kingdom became a new centre for dub production with Mikey Dread, Mad Professor and Jah Shaka being the most famous. It was also the time when dub made its influence known in the work of harder edged, experimental producers such as Mikey Dread with UB40 and The Clash, Adrian Sherwood and the roster of artists on his On-U Sound label. Many bands characterized as post-punk were heavily influenced by dub. Better-known bands such as The Police, The Clash and UB40 helped popularize Dub, with UB40&#x27;s Present Arms In Dub album being the first dub album to hit the UK top 40.

Side by side with reggae at this time (early 1980s) running B side dub mixes, a rising number of American (mostly New York state and New Jersey–based) post-disco record producers in collaboration with prominent DJs decided to supply 12 inch singles with alternate dub mixes, predating the era of &quot;remixes&quot;. Reflected in the production of records such as The Peech Boys&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Wait&quot;, Toney Lee&#x27;s &quot;Reach Up&quot;, and artists mostly on New York City labels Prelude or West End. In the aforementioned mixes the beat of the record was accentuated, &quot;unnecessary&quot; vocal parts dropped, and other DJ-friendly features making it easy to work with, like picking out key sections to play over other records, heightening the dancefloor effect.

Contemporary instances are also called &quot;dubtronica&quot;, &quot;dub-techno&quot;, &quot;steppers&quot; or electronic music influenced by dub music.

==Musical impact==
===Influence of dub===

Yale professor Michael Veal described dub as &quot;the sound of a society tearing itself apart at the seams&quot;. His book, &quot;Starship Africa&quot;, says that the African diaspora is reflected in dub by the &quot;extensive use of reverberation/delay devices and the fragmentation of the song surface&quot; – he considers dub&#x27;s use of reverb a &quot;sonic metaphor for the condition of diaspora.&quot; Veal wrote that dub creators used echo and reverb to elicit memories of African culture in their listeners. King Tubby, Lee Perry, Erroll Thompson, Mad Professor, Jah Shaka, Denis Bovell and Linton Kwesi Johnson influenced rock musicians.
From the 1980s forward, dub has been influenced by, and has in turn influenced, techno, dubtronica/dub techno, jungle, drum and bass, dubstep, house music, punk and post-punk, trip hop, ambient music, and hip hop, with electronic dub sound. Musicians and bands such as Culture Club, Bill Laswell, Jah Wobble, New Age Steppers, Public Image Ltd, The Pop Group, The Police, Massive Attack, The Clash, Adrian Sherwood, Killing Joke, Bauhaus and others demonstrate clear dub influences in their respective genres, and their innovations have in turn influenced the mainstream of the dub genre.

In 1987, US grunge rock band Soundgarden released a dub version of the Ohio Players&#x27; song &quot;Fopp&quot; alongside a more traditional rock cover of the song. DJs appeared towards the end of the 1990s who specialised in playing music by these musicians, such as the UK&#x27;s Unity Dub. In the UK, Europe, and America, independent record producers continue to produce dub. Before forming The Mars Volta, Cedric Bixler, Omar Rodriguez and other members, recorded a series of dub albums under the name De Facto since 1999.

===Influence of dub on punk and rock music===
Since the inception of dub in the late 1960s, its history has been intertwined with that of the punk rock scene in the UK. The Clash worked on collaborations involving Jamaican dub reggae creators like Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry (whose &quot;Police &amp; Thieves&quot;, co-written with Junior Murvin, was covered by the Clash on their first album) and Mikey Dread (on the Sandinista! album). As well, the English group Ruts DC, a post-Malcolm Owen incarnation of the legendary reggae influenced punk group The Ruts, released &quot;Rhythm Collision Dub Volume 1&quot; (Roir session), with the expertise of the Mad Professor. Many punk rock bands In the U.S. were exposed to dub via the rasta punk band Bad Brains from Washington, D.C., which was established and released their most influential material during the 1980s. Blind Idiot God placed dub music alongside their faster and more intense noise rock tracks. Dub was adopted by some punk rock groups of the 90s, with bands such as Rancid and NOFX writing original songs in a dub style. Often, bands considered to be ska punk play dub influenced songs; one of the first such bands to become popular was Sublime, whose albums featured both dub originals and remixes. They went on to influence more recent American bands such as Rx Bandits and The Long Beach Dub Allstars. In addition, dub influenced some types of pop, including bands such as No Doubt. No Doubt&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, features an assortment of popular dub sounds like reverb and echoing. As noted by the band themselves, No Doubt is heavily influenced by Jamaican musical aesthetics and production techniques, even recording their &quot;Rock Steady&quot; album in Kingston, Jamaica, and producing B-sides featuring dub influences on their &quot;Everything in Time&quot; B-sides album. Some controversy still exists on whether pop-ska bands like No Doubt can regard themselves as a part of dub lineage. Other bands followed in the footsteps of No Doubt, fusing pop-ska and dub influences, such as Save Ferris and Vincent.

There are also some British punk bands creating dub music. Capdown released their &quot;Civil Disobedients&quot; album, featuring the track &quot;Dub No. 1&quot;, while Sonic Boom Six and The King Blues take heavy influences from dub, mixing the genre with original punk ethics and attitudes. The post-punk band Public Image Ltd, fronted by John Lydon, formerly of Sex Pistols, often use dub and reggae influenced bass lines in their music, especially in their earlier music through various bassists who were members of the group, such as Jah Wobble and Jonas Hellborg. Their track &quot;Rise&quot;, which reached No. 11 in the UK Chart in 1986 uses a dub/reggae influenced bass line.

The British post-punk band Bauhaus were highly influenced by dub music, so far that Bauhaus&#x27; bass player, David J mentioned that their signature song, &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;, &quot;was our interpretation of dub&quot;.

Shoegaze bands such as Ride with their song &quot;King Bullshit&quot; and the intro to &quot;Time Machine&quot; have explored and experimented with dub. Slowdive also penned &quot;Souvlaki Space Station&quot; and their instrumental &quot;Moussaka Chaos&quot; as a testimony of dub influence, while the Kitchens of Distinction released &quot;Anvil Dub&quot;.

Steve Hogarth, singer with British rock band Marillion, acknowledged the influence of dub on their 2001 album &quot;Anoraknophobia&quot;.

Al Cisneros, founder and bassist of Doom Metal outfit OM has gone on record regarding the influence of Reggae and Dub on his bass playing style.

==21st-century dub==
Traditional dub has survived, and some of the originators of dub such as Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and Mad Professor have produced music in the 21st century. New artists continue to preserve the traditional dub sound, some with slight modifications but with a primary focus on reproducing the original characteristics of the sound in a live environment. Some of these artists include Dubblestandart from Vienna, Austria (who recorded the album &quot;Return from Planet Dub&quot; in collaboration with, and performing live with, Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry); Liquid Stranger from Sweden; New York City artists, including Ticklah (also known as Victor Axelrod, Earl Maxton, Calbert Walker, and Douglass &amp; Degraw), Victor Rice, Easy Star All-Stars, and Dub Trio—who have recorded and performed live with Mike Patton and are currently touring as the backing band for Matisyahu); Subatomic Sound System (who have remixed material by Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and Ari Up); Dub Is a Weapon; King Django; Dr. Israel; Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad from Rochester, New York; the Heavyweight Dub Champion from San Francisco and Colorado, Gaudi; Ott from the UK, who has released several influential albums through Twisted Records, Boom One Sound System, and Dubsmith from the Boom One Records label; Future Pigeon from Los Angeles; German artists like Disrupt and Rootah from the Jahtari label; Twilight Circus from the Netherlands; Moonlight Dub Experiment from Costa Rica; and Stand High Patrol from France. More eclectic use of dub techniques are apparent in the work of BudNubac, which mixes Cuban big band with dub techniques. Modern dub producer Ryan Moore has received critical acclaim for his Twilight Circus project.
In 2022 was released Sly &amp; Robbie vs. Roots Radics &quot;The Dub Battle&quot; produced by the Argentine artist and dub engineer Hernan &quot;Don Camel&quot; Sforzini, this work is the first to reunite all the legends of dub in one album dubbing the entire &quot;The Final Battle&quot; album, Grammy nominated in 2019. This album includes the last dubs produced by Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and Bunny &quot;Striker&quot; Lee, also dub versions produced by King Jammy, Mad Professor, Dennis Bovell, Don Camel and two unreleased dub versions of King Tubby.

==Afrofuturism and Diaspora==

Dub music is in conversation with the cultural aesthetic of Afrofuturism. Having emerged from Jamaica, this genre is regarded as the product of diaspora peoples, whose culture reflects the experience of dislocation, alienation and remembrance. Through the creation of space-filling soundscapes, faded echoes, and repetition within musical tracks, Dub artists are able to tap into such Afrofuturist concepts as the nonlinearity of time and the projection of past sounds into an unknown future space. In a 1982 essay, Luke Ehrlich describes Dub through this particular scope:

At the same time, dub music&#x27;s role in the Black musical canon marks a theme of the diaspora the music was birthed from. Due to the sonic structure of echoes and reverberations, dub can create a dream-like world symbolizing the generational trauma of African diaspora as a result of slavery. This understanding of dub gives it the power to take on the darker emotions related to the diaspora, including violence. In King Tubby&#x27;s dub mixes, one can hear sonic elements of screeching tires, gun fire, and police sirens. Artist Arthur Jafa said this about dub music and the diaspora in 1994 during a keynote address at the Organization of Black Designers Conference: 
William Gibson frequently mentions dub in the 1984 science fiction novel Neuromancer.


==Jamaican Sound System==
The most straightforward explanation of the Jamaican sound system would be an individual who deals with a mechanical system consisting of musical amplification and diffusion. This would include turntables, speakers, and a PA system. In this system the deejay is the person who speaks over the record. This is not to be confused with the American term DJ, which refers to the one in charge of selecting the tracks at an event with music. This role is known as the selector in the sound system dub culture, who also plays a vital role in the system, especially in Jamaican dancehalls.

The sound system has had a prevalent spot in music production in Jamaica for well over 60 years. The true importance and relationship between the sound system and dub music can be found in the dubbed out versions of sounds that became the source of Dub music. These dubbed out versions of songs consisted of the original track, without the vocals. Through reggae soundscape and the Jamaican Sound System, dub artists were able to creatively manipulate these dubbed out versions or remixes of songs. These dub remixes were heavily influenced with effects, vocal samples, and were essential to the progression of dub. The remixes, often referred to as versions were the B-sides of a specific record. The dub musician would add in dramatic pauses and breakdowns in the version to make the song have a dub influence and feel. The artists who were using the sound system to create dub tracks would refer to their creation of remixes of certain records versioning. In the setting of a sound system, versions allow for more vocal improvisation and expressions from the deejay. These remixes or versions would not have been possible without the Jamaican sound system and its progression over the years.

At the time Jamaica gained independence from Britain in 1962, the culture was in flux, and the country was experiencing a form of identity crisis. Throughout the 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s Jamaican audiences had come to favor American R&amp;B records over locally produced music. Jamaican sound system culture and dub music helped cement Jamaican musical forms into Jamaican national cultural identity in this critical time in the nation&#x27;s development.

<text>Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s. Initially, dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. It was not until the 1980s when the style was officially named when the two words Dance and Hall the common venue was joined to make one word DanceHall; for the first time staged and promoted on an international scale. In this time digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or &quot;ragga&quot;) becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. Key elements of dancehall music include its extensive use of Jamaican Patois rather than Jamaican standard English and a focus on the track instrumentals (or &quot;riddims&quot;).

Dancehall saw initial mainstream success in Jamaica in the 1980s; by the 1990s, it became increasingly popular in Jamaican diaspora communities. In the 2000s, dancehall experienced worldwide mainstream. By the 2010s, it began to heavily influence the work of established Western artists and producers, which has helped to further bring the genre into the Western music mainstream.

==History==

=== Lead ===
Dancehall is named after Jamaican dance halls in which popular Jamaican recordings were played by local sound systems. It both refers to the music and dance style. It faced criticism for negatively influencing Jamaican culture and portraying gangster lifestyles in a praiseworthy way.

=== Early developments - Early 1970s ===
Dancehall music, also called ragga, is a style of Jamaican popular music that had its genesis in the political turbulence of the late 1970s and became Jamaica&#x27;s dominant music in the 1980s and &#x27;90s. It was also originally called Bashment music when Jamaican dancehalls began to gain popularity.

They began in the late 1970s among lower and working-class people from the inner city of Kingston, who were not able to participate in dances uptown. Social and political changes in late-1970s Jamaica, including the change from the socialist government of Michael Manley (People&#x27;s National Party) to Edward Seaga (Jamaica Labour Party), were reflected in the shift away from the more internationally oriented roots reggae towards a style geared more towards local consumption and in tune with the music that Jamaicans had experienced when sound systems performed live.

Themes of social injustice, repatriation and the Rastafari movement were overtaken by lyrics about dancing, violence and sexuality. Though the revolutionary spirit was present in Jamaica due to this social upheaval, the radio was very conservative and failed to play the people&#x27;s music. It was this gap that the sound system was able to fill with music that the average Jamaican was more interested in. Alongside this music was the addition of the fashion, art, and dance that came along with it. This made Dancehall both a genre, and a way of life.

In contrast to roots reggae, which aimed for respectability and international recognition, dancehall did not hesitate in dealing with the day-by-day realities and basal interests of the average Jamaican—especially that of lower classes—and observing society in a provocative, gritty, and often vulgar manner. Since this put spreading via radio out of the question, dancehall initially gained popularity only through live performances in sound systems and specialized record dealing.

Dancehall&#x27;s violent lyrics, which garnered the genre much criticism since its very inception, stem from the political turbulence and gang violence of late 1970s Jamaica.

In the early days of dancehall, the prerecorded rhythm tracks (bass guitar and drums) or &quot;dub&quot; that the deejay would rap or &quot;toast&quot; over came from earlier reggae songs from the 1960s and 1970s. Ragga, specifically, refers to modern dancehall, where a deejay particularly toasts over digital (electrical) rhythms.

===Origination from the DJ scene===
Sound systems and the development of other musical technology heavily influenced dancehall music. The music needed to &quot;get where the radio didn&#x27;t reach&quot; because Jamaicans often were outside without radios. Yet they eventually found their way into the streets. However, because the audience of dancehall sessions were lower-class people, it was extremely important that they be able to hear music. Sound systems allowed people to listen to music without having to buy a radio. Therefore, the dancehall culture grew as the use of technology and sound systems got better.

The Jamaican dancehall scene was one created out of creativity and a desire for accessibility, and one that is inseparable from sound system culture. The term &#x27;Dancehall&#x27;, while now typically used in reference to the specific and uniquely Jamaican genre of music, originally referred to a physical location. This location was always an open-air venue from which DJs and later &quot;Toasters&quot;, a precursor to MCs, could perform their original mixes and songs for their audience via their sound systems. The openness of the venue paired with the innately mobile nature of the sound system, allowed performers to come to the people. Inner city communities were able to gather for fun and celebration. It was all about experiencing a vibrant and trendsetting movement.

Krista Thompson&#x27;s book &quot;Shine&quot; further expresses the experience of this trendsetting movement and how particularly women were able to confront gender ideologies to enact change. The use of video light specifically was a way to express oneself and seek visibility in the social sphere in order to be recognized as citizens in a postcolonial Jamaican society.

At the onset of the dancehall scene, sound systems were the only way that some Jamaican audiences might hear the latest songs from a popular artist. Through time, it transformed to where the purveyors of the sound systems were the artists themselves and they became whom the people came to see along with their own original sounds. With the extreme volume and low bass frequencies of the sound systems local people might very well feel the vibrations of the sounds before they could even hear them, though the sound itself did travel for miles. This visceral sensory pleasure acted as an auditory beacon, redefining musical experience.

Jamaica was one of the first cultures to pioneer the concept of remixing. As a result, production level and sound system quality were critical to Jamaica&#x27;s budding music industry. Since many locals couldn&#x27;t afford sound systems in their home, listening to one at a dance party or at a festival was their entry into audible bliss. Stage shows were also an entry for exposing artists to bigger audiences.

Writer Brougtton and Brewster&#x27;s book &quot;Last Night a DJ Saved My Life&quot; states that sound systems were a product of Jamaican social lifestyle. The success of music wasn&#x27;t just in the hands of one person anymore, it was a factor of the DJ, speaking poetic words to the audience, the Selector, harmonizing beats in an aesthetically pleasing way, and the Sound Engineer, wiring the sound systems to handle deeper and louder bass tones. Music became a factor of many elements and the physicality of that sound was a strategic puzzle left for musicians to solve.

=== 1980s–1990s (The Naming) ===
If you read the archives of the Jamaica Gleaner Newspaper you will begin to realize the context written; there was a venue like the lawns where music was played and a style on the rhythms but it was different from what was being &quot;projected&quot; as Reggae and had no name until Michael Tomlinson head of InnerCity Promotion and Lois Grant(Partners at the time) staged an event that changed the culture titled &quot;DanceHall&quot; one word... Before this event Dance And Hall (two words) were used in Jamaican lingo; but it did not represent the music of the culture but rather the venue where music was played. Their promotion company through a series of concerts led to the then emerging music which they labelled, &quot;DanceHall&quot; with the year of its staging, creating a platform for artists to be seen and heard. From 1982 The team started a series called &quot;Saturday Nite Live&quot; at Harbour View Drive-In. Promoting one of Jamaica&#x27;s finest acts alongside a US soul group. That year &#x27;83 it was Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips that headlined the initial concert and the showcase also featured boxing presentations from Muhammad Ali. The tested events were so successful that the next step was to officially launch the name of the series &quot;DanceHall.&quot;InnerCity Promotions was responsible for establishing and promoting numerous events which was significant because it marked the beginnings of the music&#x27;s recognition as the &quot;DanceHall&quot; genre. Mr. Tomlinson triumph is one to share for generations as he opened the door for a new art in a sense to emerge from it beginnings. The journey began with massive opposition received from those who wanted to control the space of entertainment to journalist, radio and TV managers, some who refused to run the commercials or play the music to promote the DanceHall series. The series continued into the early 1990s, the team Michael &quot;Savage&quot; Tomlinson and Lois Grant played an important role in nurturing and promoting the young talents of the inner city and sound system culture. Through their DanceHall live concerts, many performers found a place to use their voice and make a mark due to the opportunities afforded by InnerCity Promotions.[26] This is from the International Reggae Awards special awarded honors(irawma awards).[26]

Sound systems such as Killimanjaro, Black Scorpio, Silver Hawk, Gemini Disco, Virgo Hi-Fi, Volcano Hi-Power and Aces International soon capitalized on the new sound and introduced a new wave of deejays. The older toasters were overtaken by new stars such as Captain Sinbad, Ranking Joe, Clint Eastwood, Lone Ranger, Josey Wales, Charlie Chaplin, General Echo and Yellowman — a change reflected by the 1981 Junjo Lawes-produced album &quot;A Whole New Generation of DJs&quot;, although many went back to U-Roy for inspiration. He utilized talking over or under a &quot;riddim&quot; which is now known as the deejay&#x27;s seductive chant, part talking and part singing. Deejay records became, for the first time, more important than records featuring singers. Another trend was sound clash albums, featuring rival deejays or sound systems competing head-to-head for the appreciation of a live audience, with underground sound clash cassettes often documenting the violence that came with such rivalries.

Yellowman, one of the most successful early dancehall artists, became the first Jamaican deejay to be signed to a major American record label, and for a time enjoyed a level of popularity in Jamaica to rival Bob Marley&#x27;s peak. Yellowman often incorporated sexually explicit lyrics into his songs, which became known as &quot;slackness.&quot; He did this to address his radical opinions on society through sex and politics due to the failed Jamaican experiment of socialism while under Prime Minister Michael Manley.

The early 1980s also saw the emergence of female deejays in dancehall music, such as Lady G, Lady Saw, and Sister Nancy. Other female dancehall stars include artistes like Diana King and in the late 1990s to the 2000s Ce&#x27;cile, Spice, Macka Diamond and more.
 Beenie Man, Bounty Killer, Mad Cobra, Ninjaman, Buju Banton, and Super Cat becoming major DJs in Jamaica.

With a little help from deejay sound, &quot;sweet sing&quot; (falsetto voice) singers such as Pinchers, Cocoa Tea, Sanchez, Admiral Tibet, Frankie Paul, Half Pint, Courtney Melody, and Barrington Levy were popular in Jamaica.

Nearing the end of the 1980s, Jamaican Dancehall artists gained a lot of appeal through their no-nonsense music. This expanded the genre&#x27;s reach beyond the Land of Wood and Water&#x27;s borders. The main appeal of Dancehall was the music, and so it gained a lot of popularity overtime. Back in Jamaica hand-made posters were used not just to pull in would-be attendees to parties and dances. This process of making vibrant and colorful posters soon became an icon of the genre. It had helped in providing visual aesthetic of how Dancehalls had taken up the space and grown in the country.

King Jammy&#x27;s 1985 hit, &quot;(Under Me) Sleng Teng&quot; by Wayne Smith, with an entirely-digital rhythm hook took the dancehall reggae world by storm. Many credit this song as being the first digital rhythm in reggae, featuring a rhythm from a digital keyboard. However, The &quot;Sleng Teng&quot; rhythm was used in over 200 subsequent recordings. This deejay-led, largely synthesized chanting with musical accompaniment departed from traditional conceptions of Jamaican popular musical entertainment.

Dub poet Mutabaruka said, &quot;if 1970s reggae was red, green and gold, then in the next decade it was gold chains&quot;. It was far removed from reggae&#x27;s gentle roots and culture, and there was much debate among purists as to whether it should be considered an extension of reggae.

This shift in style again saw the emergence of a new generation of artists, such as Sean Paul, Capleton, Beenie Man and Shabba Ranks, who became famous ragga stars. A new set of producers also came to prominence: Philip &quot;Fatis&quot; Burrell, Dave &quot;Rude Boy&quot; Kelly, George Phang, Hugh &quot;Redman&quot; James, Donovan Germain, Bobby Digital, Wycliffe &quot;Steely&quot; Johnson and Cleveland &quot;Clevie&quot; Brown (aka Steely &amp; Clevie) rose to challenge Sly &amp; Robbie&#x27;s position as Jamaica&#x27;s leading rhythm section.

The faster tempo and simpler electronic beat of late-1980s and early-1990s dancehall greatly influenced the development of Reggae en Español.

===2000s===
By the early 2000s, Dancehall had gained mainstream popularity in Jamaica, as well as in the United States, Canada, Australasia and Western parts of Europe. There was also a big evolution in sound allowing artists to refine and broaden the genre. This was first seen with artists such as Sean Paul with his album &quot;Dutty Rock&quot;, whose album single &quot;Get Busy&quot; (2003) became the first dancehall single to reach number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Unlike earlier Dancehall, this new evolution was characterized by structures of music commonly heard in mainstream pop music, such as repeated choruses, melodic tunes, and hooks. Some lyrics were cleaner and featured less sexual content and profanity.

At this point it was a part of the public consciousness. Cross-genre collaborations soon became normalized, with songs such as Beyonce and Sean Paul&#x27;s 2003 hit &quot;Baby Boy&quot; and Beenie Man and Mya&#x27;s 2000 single &quot;Girls Dem Sugar.&quot; Alongside this growth many crews were formed by men, women or a mixture of both. These crews created their own dances which developed fame in the Dancehall scene.

Some of the artists who popularised this new era of Dancehall were Bounty Killer, Beenie Man, Elephant Man, Shalkal Carty, Popcaan, Vybz Kartel, Konshens, Mr. Vegas, Mavado, Ward 21, Lady Saw and Spice, some of whom saw international success. This success brought forward mainstream appeal toward Dancehall which lead into the genre&#x27;s modern era.

===Modern era: 2015—present===
Dancehall saw a new wave of popularity in Western markets in the mid-late 2010s, with immense commercial success being achieved by a number of dancehall-pop singles, including Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Work&quot; (2016) and Drake&#x27;s &quot;One Dance&quot; and &quot;Controlla&quot; (2016). Dancehall also reached the attention of many R&amp;B artists who continued to change and evolve the genre.

A variety of western artists have spoken of being inspired by Dancehall music, including Major Lazer, whose commercially successful singles Lean On (2015), Light It Up (2015) and Run Up (2017) all heavily rely upon dancehall music. Several hip-hop and R&amp;B artists have also released material inspired by dancehall music, including Drake, who has cited Vybz Kartel as one of his &quot;biggest inspirations.&quot;

In 2014, Drake took an interest into Popcaan and linked him up with MixPak producer Dre Skull to release his debut album &#x27;Where We Come From&#x27;. This saw huge commercial success and went on to receive a UK MOBO award for Best Reggae Album in 2015. The year of 2016 saw Popcaan&#x27;s rival-artist Alkaline release his debut album &#x27;New Level Unlocked&#x27; under DJ Frass Records, which topped the charts in Jamaica, as well as being well received in the US and UK.

Popcaan and Alkaline have always been rival music artists in Jamaica and it is much debated who is the new Dancehall King, since Vybz Kartel was incarcerated in 2011. It has been said that Popcaan&#x27;s success is largely due to early support from Vybz Kartel(KOTD) and more recent support from Drake.

By 2016, Dancehall had re-emerged into global popularity, artists such as Alkaline, Popcaan, Spice, Aidonia and Rygin King are known as some of the most profound and active artists of this period to date. There have also been prominent global collaborations with dancehall artist such as Beyonce &amp; Shatta Wale&#x27;s &#x27;Already&#x27;, Davido &amp; Popcaan on &#x27;Story&#x27;, and Stefflon Don &amp; French Montana on &#x27;Hurtin&#x27; me&#x27;.

Since 2017, Dancehall artists from Jamaica have been frequently collaborating with UK acts such as Chip, Stefflon Don and J Hus. This is well in-tune with the boost of urban acts in the UK rising up, and the rebirth of Grime in 2014.

In the late 2010s, a new wave of artists rose to popularity in Jamaica. These artists come from rural parishes, especially Montego Bay, outside of the commercial center of the Jamaican music industry. They are influenced by American trap music, and sometimes refer to lottery scamming in their lyrics. Some of the most popular artists in this style are Chronic Law, Rygin King, and Squash.

== Musical characteristics ==
Three major elements of Jamaican dancehall music are the use of digital instruments, particularly the Casio Casiotone MT-40 electronic keyboard, the Oberheim DX drum machine, and the use of riddims, instrumentals to which lyrics are added, resulting in an unusual process of creating songs from separate components. More specifically, many riddims are created using digital instruments like the MT-40, a practice that first became popular in 1985 with the release of &#x27;Under Mi Sleng Teng,&#x27; whose success made the accessibility of digitally-composed riddims apparent (Manuel-Marshall, p. 453).

=== Riddims ===
A single riddim can be used in multiple songs, paired with different sets of lyrics; the inverse is also possible, with a single set of lyrics being attached to different riddims.  Riddims and lyric sets are not exclusive to any one artist, and these can be and are spread around with one particular riddim, &#x27;Real Rock,&#x27; first recorded in 1967 for a song of the same name, being used in at least 269 songs by 2006 over the course of 39 years. Peter Manuel and Wayne Marshall noted in 2006 that most songs were set to one of about a dozen riddims that were in vogue, with the exceptions being the work of individual, often high-ranked, artists. Recording over riddims forms the basis of dancehall, with modern dancehall layering vocals over ostinatos; the DJs providing the vocals thus, in the words of Manuel and Marshall, carry the song, unlike older dancehall where vocals were interwoven with full songs.

These practices&#x27; roots can be described with the concept of families of resemblance as coined by George Lipsitz in 1986 – similarities between other groups&#x27; experiences and cultures (Lipsitz, p. 160). Here, the term might describe the links between different artists via shared riddims and lyric sets and through common experiences incorporated into the music.

==Culture==
Donna P. Hope defines dancehall culture as a &quot;space for the cultural creation and dissemination of symbols and ideologies that reflect the lived realities of its adherents, particularly those from the inner cities of Jamaica.&quot; Dancehall culture actively creates a space for its &quot;affectors&quot; (creators of dancehall culture) and its &quot;affectees&quot; (consumers of dancehall culture) to take control of their own representation, contest conventional relationships of power, and exercise some level of cultural, social and even political autonomy.

Kingsley Stewart outlines ten of the major cultural imperatives or principles that constitute the dancehall worldview. They are:

# It involves the dynamic interweaving of God and Haile Selassie
# It acts as a form of stress release or psycho-physiological relief
# It acts as a medium for economic advancement
# The quickest way to an object is the preferred way (i.e., the speed imperative)
# The end justifies the means
# It strives to make the unseen visible
# Objects and events that are external to the body are more important than internal processes; what is seen is more important than what is thought (i.e., the pre-eminence of the external)
# The importance of the external self; the self is consciously publicly constructed and validated
# The ideal self is shifting, fluid, adaptive, and malleable, and
# It involves the socioexistential imperative to transcend the normal (i.e., there is an emphasis on &quot;not&quot; being normal).

Such a drastic change in the popular music of the region generated an equally radical transformation in fashion trends, specifically those of its female faction. In lieu of traditional, modest &quot;rootsy&quot; styles, as dictated by Rastafari-inspired gender roles; women began donning flashy, revealing – sometimes X-rated outfits. This transformation is said to coincide with the influx of &quot;slack&quot; lyrics within dancehall, which objectified women as apparatuses of pleasure. These women would team up with others to form &quot;modeling posses&quot;, or &quot;dancehall model&quot; groups, and informally compete with their rivals.

This newfound materialism and conspicuity was not, however, exclusive to women or manner of dress. Appearance at dance halls was exceedingly important to acceptance by peers and encompassed everything from clothing and jewelry, to the types of vehicles driven, to the sizes of each respective gang or &quot;crew&quot;, and was equally important to both sexes.

One major theme behind dancehall is that of space. Sonjah Stanley Niaah, in her article &quot;Mapping Black Atlantic Performance Geographies&quot;, says

Dancehall occupies multiple spatial dimensions (urban, street, police, marginal, gendered, performance, liminal, memorializing, communal), which are revealed through the nature and type of events and venues, and their use and function. Most notable is the way in which dancehall occupies a liminal space between what is celebrated and at the same time denigrated in Jamaica and how it moves from private community to public and commercial enterprise.

In &quot;Kingston&#x27;s Dancehall: A Story of Space and Celebration&quot;, she writes:

Dancehall is ultimately a celebration of the disenfranchised selves in postcolonial Jamaica that occupy and creatively sustain that space. Structured by the urban, a space that is limited, limiting, and marginal yet central to communal, even national, identity, dancehall&#x27;s identity is as contradictory and competitive as it is sacred. Some of Jamaica&#x27;s significant memories of itself are inscribed in the dancehall space, and therefore dancehall can be seen as a site of collective memory that functions as ritualized memorializing, a memory bank of the old, new, and dynamic bodily movements, spaces, performers, and performance aesthetics of the New World and Jamaica in particular.

These same notions of dancehall as a cultural space are echoed in Norman Stolzoff&#x27;s &quot;Wake the Town and Tell the People&quot;. He notes that dancehall is not merely a sphere of passive consumerism, but rather is an alternative sphere of active cultural production that acts as a means through which black lower-class youth articulate and project a distinct identity in local, national, and global contexts. Through dancehall, ghetto youths attempt to deal with the endemic problems of poverty, racism, and violence, and in this sense the dancehall acts as a communication center, a relay station, a site where black lower-class culture attains its deepest expression. Thus, dancehall in Jamaica is yet another example of the way that the music and dance cultures of the African diaspora have challenged the passive consumerism of mass cultural forms, such as recorded music, by creating a sphere of active cultural production that potentially may transform the prevailing hegemony of society.

In &quot;Out and Bad: Toward a Queer Performance Hermeneutic in Jamaican Dancehall&quot; Nadia Ellis explicates the culture of combined homophobia and unabashed queerness within Jamaican dancehall culture. She details the particular importance of the phrase &quot;out and bad&quot; to Jamaica when she writes, &quot;This phrase is of queer hermeneutical possibility in Jamaican dancehall because it registers a dialectic between queer and gay that is never resolved, that relays back and forth, producing an uncertainty about sexual identity and behavior that is usefully maintained in the Jamaican popular cultural context.&quot; In discussion of the possibility of a self identifying homosexual dancer performing to homophobic music she writes, &quot;In appropriating the culture and working from within its very center, he produces a bodily performance that gains him power. It is the power or mastery, of parody, and of getting away with it.&quot;

Ellis not only examines the intersection of queerness and masculinity within the Jamaican dancehall scene, but suggests that the overt homophobia of certain dancehall music actually creates a space for queer expression. In general, homosexuality and queerness are still stigmatized in dancehalls. In fact, some of the songs used during dancehall sessions contain blatant homophobic lyrics. Ellis argues, however, this explicit, violent rhetoric is what creates a space for queer expression in Jamaica. She describes the phenomenon of all male dance groups that have sprung up within the dancehall scene. These crews dress in matching, tight clothing, often paired with makeup and dyed hair, traditional hallmarks of queerness within Jamaican culture. When they perform together, it is the bodily performance that give the homosexual dancers power.

=== Dances ===
The popularity of dancehall has spawned dance moves that help to make parties and stage performances more energetic. Dancing is an integral part of bass culture genres. As people felt the music in the crowded dancehall venues, they would do a variety of dances. Eventually, dancehall artists started to create songs that either invented new dances or formalized some moves done by dancehall goers. Many dance moves seen in hip hop videos are actually variations of dancehall dances. Examples of such dances are: &quot;Like Glue&quot;, &quot;Bogle&quot;, &quot;Whine &amp; Dip&quot;, &quot;Tek Weh Yuhself&quot;, &quot;Whine Up&quot;, &quot;Shake It With Shaun&quot; (a mix of various genres), &quot;Boosie Bounce&quot;, &quot;Drive By&quot;, &quot;Shovel It&quot;, &quot;To Di World&quot;, &quot;Dutty Wine&quot;, &quot;Sweep&quot;, &quot;Nuh Behavior&quot;, &quot;Nuh Linga&quot;, &quot;Skip to My Lou&quot;, &quot;Gully Creepa&quot;, &quot;Breakdancing&quot; ,&quot;Bad Man Forward Bad Man Pull Up&quot;, &quot;Keeping it Jiggy&quot;, &quot;Pon Di River&quot;, &quot;One Drop&quot;, &quot;Whine &amp; Kotch&quot;, &quot;Bubbling&quot;, &quot;Tic Toc&quot;, &quot;Willie Bounce&quot;, &quot;Wacky Dip&quot;, &quot;Screetchie&quot;, &quot;One Vice&quot; and &quot;Daggering&quot;.

==Criticisms==
===Cultural elements===
Dancehall combines elements of materialism and stories of hardships of Jamaica. This is seen in the use of gun talk by artists like Buju Banton and Capleton, or the sporting of bling-bling by &quot;Gangsta Ras&quot; artists like Mavado and Munga. The term &quot;Gangsta Ras&quot;, which combines thuggish imagery with Rastafari is according to Rasta critics, an example of how in dancehall, &quot;the misuse of Rastafari culture has diluted and marginalised the central tenets and creed of the Rastafari philosophy and way of life&quot;.

Kingsley Stewart points out that artists sometimes feel an &quot;imperative to transcend the normal&quot;, exemplified by artists like Elephant Man and Bounty Killer doing things to stand out, such as putting on a synthetic cartoonish voice or donning pink highlights while constantly re-asserting hypermasculine attributes. Donna P. Hope argues that this trend is related to the rise of market capitalism as a dominant feature of life in Jamaica, coupled with the role of new media and a liberalized media landscape, where images become of increasing importance in the lives of ordinary Jamaicans who strive for celebrity and superstar status on the stages of dancehall and Jamaican popular culture.

Another point of dissension of dancehall from reggae, and from its non-western roots in Jamaica, is on the focus on materialism. Dancehall has also become popular in regions such as Ghana and Panama. Prominent males in the dancehall scene are expected to dress in very expensive casual wear, indicative of European urban styling and high fashion that suggest wealth and status. Since the late 1990s, males in the dancehall culture have rivalled their female counterparts to look fashioned and styled. The female dancehall divas are all scantily clad, or dressed in spandex outfits that accentuate more than cover the shape of the body. In the documentary &quot;It&#x27;s All About Dancing&quot;, prominent dancehall artist Beenie Man argues that one could be the best DJ or the smoothest dancer, but if one wears clothing that reflects the economic realities of the majority of the partygoers, one will be ignored, and later Beenie Man returned to perform as Ras Moses.

=== Guns and violent imagery ===
According to Carolyn Cooper in &quot;Sound Clash&quot;, written in 2004, dancehall music and its following were frequently attacked for frequent references to guns and violence in lyrics, with Cooper responding by arguing that the emergence of firearms was less a sign of genuinely violent undercurrents in dancehall and more a theatrical adoption of the role of guns as tools of power. That ties into the concepts of the badman, a defiant, rebellious figure who often use a gun to maintain a level of respect and fear.  Said concepts, Cooper argues, originate in historical resistance to slavery and emulation of imported films, specifically North American action films with gun-wielding protagonists.

Adding to the concept of gunfire as theatrical element is the use of gunfire as a way to show support for a performing DJ or singer, which eventually gave way to flashing cigarette lighters, displaying glowing cellphone monitors, and igniting aerosol sprays. Gunfire as a form of cheering has extended beyond dancehall culture with the phrase &quot;pram, pram!&quot; becoming a general expression of approval or support.

However, Cooper&#x27;s assessment of the presence of guns in Jamaican dancehall is not wholly uncritical, with a discussion of Buju Banton&#x27;s &#x27;Mr. Nine&#x27; interpreting the song as a denouncement of what Cooper describes as gun culture gone out of control.

Part of the criticism of Jamaican dancehall appears to be the product of cultural clash stemming from a lack of insider knowledge on the nuances of the music&#x27;s content and the culture surrounding said music.  This struggle is something ethnomusicologists struggle with, even within an academic setting, with Bruno Nettl describing in &quot;The Study of Ethnomusicology&quot; how &quot;insider&quot; and &quot;outsider&quot; viewpoints would reveal different understandings on the same music. Indeed, Nettl later mentions growing questions of who ethnomusicological studies benefited, especially from the groups being studied.  And even then, in &quot;May It Fill Your Soul&quot;, Timothy Rice mentioned that even insider scholars required a level of distanciation to scrutinize their own cultures as needed.

===Anti-gay lyrics===
After the popularizing of Buju Banton&#x27;s dancehall song &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot; in the early 1990s, dancehall music came under criticism from international organizations and individuals over anti-gay lyrics. In some cases, dancehall artists whose music featured anti-gay lyrics have had their concerts cancelled. Various singers were investigated by international law enforcement agencies such as Scotland Yard, on the grounds that the lyrics incited the audience to assault gay people. For example, Buju Banton&#x27;s 1993 hit &quot;Boom Bye Bye&quot; advocates the violent assaults and murders of gay people. Another example, T.O.K.&#x27;s song &quot;Chi Chi Man,&quot; advocates the killing of gay men and women.

Some of the affected singers believed that legal or commercial sanctions were an attack against freedom of speech, often blaming racism, claiming that the response to their lyrics resulted from anti-black attitudes in the international music industry. However, many artists have over time apologized for their mistreatment of LGBTQ+ communities, particularly in Jamaica, and agreed to not use anti-gay lyrics nor continue to perform or profit off their previously anti-gay music. &quot;Stop Murder Music&quot; is/was a movement against homophobia in dancehall music. This movement actively targeted homophobia in dancehall music and was partially initiated by a controversial UK based group OutRage! and supported by the Black Gay Men&#x27;s Advisory Group (UK based) and J-Flag (Jamaica based). It led to some dancehall artists signing the Reggae Compassionate Act. Dancehall artist Mista Majah P has created dancehall music more recently that celebrates and advocates for LGBTQ+ people.

Some artists agreed not to use anti-gay lyrics during their concerts in certain countries internationally because their concerts kept being protested and cancelled. However, some commentators claim this fails to address the most serious effects of the anti-gay lyrics in dancehall music, which are on the LGBTQ+ people of Jamaica, where this music is most present.

The progressive cultural critic Tavia Nyong&#x27;o argues that the criticism of homophobia in dancehall is simply an anti-black association of homophobia with blackness. At the same time, however, he argues that such criticism is still important to black communities, and that the international community acts as though it is not. To N&#x27;yongo, this represents an anti-black and anti-gay attitude that works to &quot;erase&quot; intersectional black LGBTQ+ identities. 

Mista Majah P has claimed that artists who have never used anti-gay lyrics, and even write music advocating for gay rights, are often excluded from certain spaces due to the association between the genre and homophobia.

Dancehall music has had a significant and complex impact on many LGBTQ+ black people, particularly with connections to Jamaica, both in terms of cultural importance and at times deeply violent lyrics. This is demonstrated in the film &quot;Out and Bad: London&#x27;s LGBT Dancehall Scene&quot; which discusses the experience of a group of LGBTQ+ black, and mostly Jamaican, people in London. Dancehall is important to their culture, both in connection with Jamaican heritage and in how social interactions are constructed around dance and music. However, the film discusses how many dancehall songs contain blatantly homophobic and transphobic lyrics. One interviewee comments, &quot;we still enjoy ourselves to these kinds of music because [what matters to us is] the rhythm of the music, the beat, the way the music makes us feel.&quot;

Scholars have theorized around the significance and meaning around the use of anti-gay lyrics in dancehall music. Donna P. Hope argues that dancehall culture&#x27;s anti-gay lyrics formed part of a macho discussion that advanced the interest of the heterosexual male in Jamaica, which is a Christian society with strong Rastafari movement influence as well. Dancehall culture in Jamaica often included imagery of men dressing and dancing in a way stereotypically associated with gay-male style. However, the cultural, religious, and social gender-norms continued to advance the ideal man as macho and heterosexual, any divergence from this would be identified as inadequate and impure portraits of true masculinity.

Some authors have suggested that this duality, the presentation of &quot;queerness,&quot; in dance style and dress, and the violent homophobia, in dancehall spaces can be explained by the ritualistic &quot;doing away with &#x27;homosexuality&#x27;.&quot; Scholar Nadia Ellis suggests that when songs with homophobic lyrics are played, the environment of dancehall spaces can become serious and individuals can use the opportunity to reinstate their allegiance to heteronormativity. These songs thus act to &quot;consecrate&quot; the spaces as straight and masculine. In the safety this ritualized hetero-normativity creates, the space may be opened to more free expression and participants can then more openly engage with styles and dancing that might have been seen as queer. Ellis writes: &quot;The songs are played; no one is &#x27;gay&#x27;; everyone can turn a blind eye.&quot;

The backlash to Banton&#x27;s violently anti-gay &quot;Boom Bye-Bye&quot;, and the reality of Kingston&#x27;s violence which saw the deaths of deejays Pan Head and Dirtsman saw another shift, this time back towards Rastafari and cultural themes, with several of the hardcore slack ragga artists finding religion, and the &quot;conscious ragga&quot; scene becoming an increasingly popular movement. A new generation of singers and deejays emerged that harked back to the roots reggae era, notably Garnett Silk, Tony Rebel, Sanchez, Luciano, Anthony B and Sizzla. Some popular deejays, most prominently Buju Banton and Capleton, began to cite Rastafari and turn their lyrics and music in a more conscious, rootsy direction. Many modern dancehall Rasta artists identify with Bobo Ashanti.

== Women&#x27;s message of power and control ==
Dancehalls are used to communicate messages of women&#x27;s power and control in a protest against their gendered experience embedded in Jamaican culture. Danger, a dancehall queen and the winner of the International Dancehall Queen Competition in 2014, expresses her power through dancehalls as she explains: &quot;We are queens, we are not afraid to go out there to do what we want to, demand what we want, and to live how we want, and represent women all over the world and to let them know it is okay to be yourself and that it is ok to not hold back&quot; Raquel, also known as Dancing Princess, describes her ability to communicate through the dancehall: &quot;What you&#x27;ve lived, what you feel, put it in the dance. That&#x27;s what dance is, expressing with your body what you feel and who you are. (...) dancehall is the way of the woman to say no, I am a woman respect me.&quot; As evidenced by these women, dancehall is a space that allows for women to be empowered and to communicate their liberation from the boundaries imposed on them. Rather by negotiating their own boundaries in the dancehall, by taking control of their bodies, and by communicating their power, they are demanding respect when confronted by those who do not believe they deserve it.

<text>Eileen Vartan Barker (born 21 April 1938, in Edinburgh, UK) is a professor in sociology, an emeritus member of the London School of Economics (LSE), and a consultant to that institution&#x27;s Centre for the Study of Human Rights. She is the chairperson and founder of the Information Network Focus on Religious Movements (INFORM) and has written studies about cults and new religious movements.

==Academic career==
Barker has been involved with the LSE&#x27;s sociology department, where she received her PhD, since 1970.

In 1988, she engaged in research on the preservation of cultural identity in the Armenian diaspora. In the same year, she founded the Information Network Focus on Religious Movements (INFORM) with the support of the Archbishop of Canterbury and financial help from the British Home Office.

Barker has held numerous positions of leadership in the academic study of religion. She served as the chairperson of the British Sociological Association&#x27;s Study Group for the Sociology of Religion from 1985 to 1990, as president of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion from 1991 to 1993 (the first non-American to hold that office), and as president of the Association for the Sociology of Religion from 2001 to 2002.

In 2000, Barker became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and the American Academy of Religion awarded her its Martin E. Marty Award for Contributions to the Public Understanding of Religion.

Barker was a member of the editorial review board of &quot;Cultic Studies Review&quot;, an academic journal that offered peer-reviewed scholarship alongside news concerning cults and new religious movements. Barker subsequently joined the editorial board of the &quot;International Journal of Cultic Studies&quot;, which superseded &quot;Cultic Studies Review&quot; in 2010.

==&quot;The Making of a Moonie&quot;==
Her 1984 book &quot;The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing?&quot; is based on close to seven years of study of Unification Church members (informally called &quot;Moonies&quot;) in the United Kingdom and the United States. Laurence Iannaccone of George Mason University, a specialist in the economics of religion, wrote that &quot;The Making of a Moonie&quot; was &quot;one of the most comprehensive and influential studies&quot; of the process of conversion to new religious movements.

==Opinions of others==
Brainwashing proponents Margaret Singer and Janja Lalich have criticised Barker&#x27;s rejection of the brainwashing hypothesis in her study of the conversion process for members of the Unification Church. Singer and Lalich, in their 1995 book &quot;Cults in Our Midst&quot;, called Barker a &quot;procult apologist&quot; for adopting an &quot;apologist stance&quot; towards the Unification Church, and noted that she had received payment from the Church for expenses for a book and eighteen conferences from the Unification Church. Barker defended this by stating that it had been approved by her university and a government grants council, and saved taxpayer money.

Barker responded to the financial issues in a 1995 paper, writing that &quot;[w]hat is less well known is that vast amounts of money are at stake in the fostering of brainwashing and mind control thesis in the anti-cult movement secondary constructions&quot;, and noting that &quot;deprogrammers&quot; and &quot;exit counselors&quot; charge tens of thousands of dollars for their services and that &quot;expert witnesses&quot; such as Singer &quot;have charged enormous fees for giving testimony about brainwashing in court cases&quot;.

Barker&#x27;s INFORM organisation has been criticised by the Family Action Information Resource chaired by former Conservative Home Office minister and anti-cult campaigner Tom Sackville, who cut INFORM&#x27;s Home Office funding in 1997. In 1999, it was reported that INFORM was facing closure, due to lack of funds. By 2000, Home Office funding was restored, prompting Sackville to warn that INFORM might provide government with bad advice, adding, &quot;I cancelled INFORM&#x27;s grant and I think it&#x27;s absurd that it&#x27;s been brought back&quot;. Criticism of INFORM has focused on Barker&#x27;s reluctance to condemn all new religions as &quot;cults&quot;. Barker responded to the criticism by saying, &quot;We are not cult apologists. People make a lot of noise without doing serious research – so much so that they can end up sounding as closed to reason as the cults they&#x27;re attacking. Besides, I imagine FAIR was disappointed not to get our funding&quot;.

In a 2003 collection of essays in honour of Barker, the influential Oxford University-based religious scholar Bryan R. Wilson commented that INFORM was &quot;often in a position from which it can reassure relatives about the character, disposition, policy, provenance and prospects of a given movement. It may be able to deflate some widely circulated rumours and false impressions derived from media comment&quot;. Wilson added that Barker&#x27;s social science research, in particular her work on the Unification Church, had been instrumental in demonstrating that the brainwashing concept, which for some years had enjoyed popularity in the media, was unable to explain what actually happened in the process of religious conversion, or to explain why so many members of new religious movements actually leave these movements again after a short period.

Australian psychologist Len Oakes and British psychiatry professor Anthony Storr, who have written critically about cults, gurus, new religious movements, and their leaders, have praised Barker&#x27;s work on the Unification Church&#x27;s conversion process.

==Political career==
Barker, a member of the Liberal Democrats, was an unsuccessful Queen&#x27;s Park ward candidate in May 2002 and an unsuccessful Kenton ward candidate in May 2006.

<doc id="183310" wikidata="Q1045541" url="?curid=183310" title="G-funk">
<text>G-funk, short for gangsta funk, (or funk rap) is a sub-genre of gangsta rap that emerged from the West Coast scene in the early 1990s. The genre is heavily influenced by the synthesizer-heavy 1970s funk sound of Parliament-Funkadelic (aka P-Funk), often incorporated through samples or re-recordings. It is represented by commercially successful albums such as Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic&quot; (1992), Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Doggystyle&quot; (1993), and 2Pac&#x27;s &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; (1996).

==Characteristics==
G-funk, which uses funk with an artificially altered tempo, incorporates multi-layered and melodic synthesizers, slow hypnotic grooves, a deep bass, heavy use of the snare drum, background female vocals, the extensive sampling of P-Funk tunes, and a high-pitched portamento saw wave synthesizer lead. G-funk is typically set at between 90 and 100 BPM. The lyrical content depended on the artist and could consist of sex, drug use (especially marijuana), love for a city, and love for friends. There was also a slurred &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;smooth&quot; way of rapping in order to clarify words and stay in rhythmic cadence. Many R&amp;B and pop singles of the 1990s incorporated the G-funk sound to their music.

The trademark West Coast G-funk style of hip-hop was a very defining element of the region&#x27;s music and helped distinguish it from the rivaling rap scene on the East Coast. In essence, the smooth, slow-tempo sound of G-funk accompanied the perceived &quot;laid-back&quot; stereotype of Californian culture whereas East Coast hip-hop typically featured more aggressive attitudes alongside a fast-paced tempo (e.g. hardcore hip-hop).

Unlike other earlier rap acts that also utilized funk samples (such as EPMD and the Bomb Squad), G-funk often utilized fewer, unaltered samples per song. Music theorist Adam Krims has described G-funk as &quot;a style of generally West Coast rap whose musical tracks tend to deploy live instrumentation, heavy on bass and keyboards, with minimal (sometimes no) sampling and often highly conventional harmonic progressions and harmonies&quot;. Dr. Dre, a pioneer of the G-funk genre, normally uses live musicians to replay the original music of sampled records. This enabled him to produce music that had his own sounds, rather than a direct copy of the sample.

==History and origins==
===1988–1992: Beginnings===
Although it is a predominantly West Coast sound, one of the earliest examples of hip-hop making strong use of synths over funky samples is &quot;The R&quot;, released in mid-1988 by New York duo Eric B. &amp; Rakim. The origins of the style, however, are mainly attributed to Dr. Dre, who produced tracks by N.W.A such as &quot;Dope Man&quot; (1987) and &quot;Gangsta Gangsta&quot; (1988), both of which sampled the squealing synth solo from Ohio Players&#x27; &quot;Funky Worm&quot; that would later go on to be sampled many times by other artists, including Michigan duo MC Breed &amp; DFC on their mid-1991 hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Future in Yo&#x27; Frontin&#x27;&quot;. This solo, moreover, provided the blueprint for G-funk&#x27;s distinctive synth tone in later years. Dre also produced the D.O.C.&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Funky Enough&quot; and &quot;The Formula&quot; in 1989, the former being an early minor hit for the genre, reaching No. 12 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Two years later, in 1991, N.W.A released another early example of the genre with their album &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot;; the album reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The same year, Ice Cube&#x27;s diss track towards N.W.A, &quot;No Vaseline&quot;, was made in the style. Dr. Dre, who produced &quot;No One Can Do It Better&quot; and &quot;Niggaz4Life&quot;, is often seen as the originator/creator of the G-funk sound. Though these claims have been disputed with Cold 187um (a member of Above the Law) claiming that he came up with the name and sound.

===1992–1997: Mainstream peak===
The genre experienced a breakout year in 1992, with Dr. Dre dropping his album &quot;The Chronic&quot;. The album was a massive success, having three top 40 singles: &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot;, the Eazy-E diss &quot;Dre Day&quot;, and &quot;Let Me Ride.&quot; It also reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and No. 1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album was eventually certified Triple Platinum by the RIAA in 1993 for selling three-million copies; it has also been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Though G-funk had previously existed, Dr. Dre&#x27;s The Chronic is often seen as the beginning of the genre. 
The following year had numerous successful songs and albums, Ice Cube&#x27;s songs &quot;It Was a Good Day&quot; and &quot;Check Yo Self&quot;; both made it to the top 20 (peaking at No. 15 and No. 20 respectively) and were both certified at least gold. &quot;It Was a Good Day&quot; is commonly placed high on best of lists for the genre, being considered &quot;one of the best G-Funk tracks ever made&quot;. Snoop Dogg released his first album &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, which debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and contained the hits &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s My Name?&quot;, both songs reached No. 8 on the Hot 100. The album was certified Quadruple Platinum, and both singles were certified gold. Eazy-E released the G-funk-influenced album &quot;It&#x27;s On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa&quot;, which reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200, and contained the No. 42 hit &quot;Real Muthaphuckkin G&#x27;s&quot;, which was made as a response to Dre&#x27;s song &quot;Dre Day&quot; from the previous year.

The genre&#x27;s popularity grew even bigger in 1994, especially because of Warren G&#x27;s song &quot;Regulate&quot;, which was featured on the &quot;Above the Rim&quot; soundtrack. The single reached the top 10 peaking at No. 2. His album &quot;Regulate... G Funk Era&quot; which also contained the song, and another top 10 hit &quot;This D.J.&quot;, reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200. Popular rapper MC Hammer went for a more gangsta image and G-funk sound on his album &quot;The Funky Headhunter&quot;, which contained the No. 26 single &quot;Pumps and a Bump&quot;. The G-funk group Thug Life, featuring 2Pac, released their first and only album, &quot;Thug Life: Volume 1&quot;; it peaked at No. 42 on the Billboard 200. The album had minor hit single with &quot;Cradle to the Grave&quot;. The song charted on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and on the Hot Rap Songs charts; it placed No. 91 on the former and No. 25 on the latter. West coast rapper Coolio released his debut album &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; in 1994. The album peaked at No. 8; it contains the Top-10 hit &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;.

In 1995, 2Pac released the album &quot;Me Against the World&quot; which although not entirely G-funk, has been described as having &quot;half the record [resound] to the boom and bap of New York&quot; while having &quot;the rest [shimmer] in a G-funk haze&quot;. The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and was certified Double Platinum. Later in the year, he released the G-funk classic &quot;California Love&quot; which as a double A-side with &quot;How Do U Want It&quot;, hit No. 1 on the Hot 100. In October 1995, Tha Dogg Pound released their debut album &quot;Dogg Food&quot; and it debuted at No. 1 on the billboard, continuing G-funk&#x27;s dominance in the mainstream with the top 50 singles &quot;New York, New York&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Play House&quot;.

In 1996, the super-group Westside Connection released &quot;Bow Down&quot;. It had two hit singles, &quot;Bow Down&quot; and &quot;Gangstas Make the World Go Round&quot;, which peaked at No. 21 and No. 40, respectively. The album itself peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA in 1997. 2Pac released his album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;, which has been described as &quot;lush G-funk&quot; and as having a &quot;commercial G-funk sheen&quot;. The album hit No. 1. In 1997, Warren G released his second album, &quot;Take a Look Over Your Shoulder&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200; it had two Top-40 singles, a cover of &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; and &quot;Smokin&#x27; Me Out&quot;.

Although the majority of G-funk music has come out of California, the overall sound has been utilized by additional US rappers and hip-hop groups that were based in other states across the U.S. during the time of the style&#x27;s popularity in the 1990s. Some of the most notable of these artists include Outkast (Georgia), G-Slimm (Louisiana), Bone Thugs-n-Harmony (Ohio), Tela (Tennessee), Top Authority (Michigan), E.S.G. (Texas) and DMG (Minnesota).

In the 1990s, Houston, Texas, had a small, but noteworthy, G-funk scene at the peak of the genre&#x27;s popularity. Artists from the city include the Geto Boys, Blac Monks, E.S.G., 5th Ward Boyz, Street Military, Big Mello, Scarface, Ganksta N-I-P, Bushwick Bill, Big 50, 5th Ward Juvenilez and South Circle.

===1997–present: Influences on modern hip-hop===
In the late 1990s and 2000s, G-funk music significantly declined in mainstream popularity. Dr. Dre&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;2001&quot;, produced by Mel-Man, was noted as &quot;reinvent[ing] his sound, moving away from G-funk to something more gothic and string-heavy.&quot;

In 2001, Warren G released his fourth studio album, &quot;The Return of the Regulator&quot;. The album includes &quot;Here Comes Another Hit&quot; , (which featured Nate Dogg and Mista Grimm) and Lookin&#x27; at You (featuring LaToiya Williams). The album can be considered a return to the roots of G-funk West Coast gangsta music, but it sold less than the rapper&#x27;s two previous albums.

Midwestern rapper Tech N9ne made use of the G-funk style on his early releases, most notably his second studio album, &quot;The Worst&quot; (2000). His 2001 follow-up album, &quot;Anghellic&quot;, incorporated the subgenre&#x27;s characteristics to a much lesser extent.

Most recently, starting in the 2010s, many contemporary West Coast rappers have released albums which contain strong G-funk influences, including Kendrick Lamar with &quot;Good Kid, M.A.A.D City&quot; as well as &quot;To Pimp a Butterfly&quot;, YG with &quot;Still Brazy&quot;, Schoolboy Q with &quot;Blank Face LP&quot;, Nipsey Hussle with &quot;Victory Lap&quot;, Buddy with &quot;Harlan &amp; Alondra&quot; and Tech N9ne with &quot;The Gates Mixed Plate&quot;.

<doc id="183315" wikidata="Q2064394" url="?curid=183315" title="Worldbeat">
<text>Worldbeat is a music genre that blends pop music or rock music with world music or traditional music. Worldbeat is similar to other cross-pollination labels of contemporary and roots genres, and which suggest a rhythmic, harmonic or textural contrast and synthesis between its modern and ethnic elements.

==Definition==
Worldbeat is akin to world fusion and global fusion, each of which primarily manifest as a blend of non-Western music tradition and Western, popular music. These particular music genres can also reflect in a cross-blend of more than one &quot;traditional&quot; flavor, producing innovative, expressions of world music. As with most &quot;world&quot;-laden genre categories, worldbeat is not clearly defined as are the many classic world music subgenres, such as gamelan, or calypso. In general, the expanding family of ethnic music subgenres under the world music umbrella represents an intrinsically nebulous terminology, which depending on how one interprets a particular hybrid of world music, can be interchangeable to a significant degree. Worldbeat defines a hybrid of what can be listed under the generalized world music term, even though it features a prominent interbreeding with elements of Western, pop music.

As an ethnically coloured genre, worldbeat is a part of the world music movement that is steadily influencing popular music in every corner of the globe. This is partially due to the advance of digital music production and the availability of high quality ethnic music samples to artists and producers in the recording arts. The globalization of texture and style between indigenous and modern music genres has rapidly expanded the scope of 21st century, popular music, and continues to reshape how the world defines the increasing number of genres conceived with world music elements.

===Distinction relative to world music===
Worldbeat, world fusion and global fusion are hybrid genres that have evolved under the world music genre. Their most prominent feature is an obvious meld between pop and indigenous culture, which often causes them to be indistinguishable from one another.

Contemporary genre hybrids with world music elements naturally proliferate in proportion to the globalization of music culture. In music catalogs, hybrid genres are often only given the database choice of &quot;world&quot;, thus the perception of what can define world music has evolved to include pop influences.

There is disagreement whether all pop and traditional music hybrids exhibiting prominent ethno-influences, such as worldbeat, belong under the world music umbrella.

===Similar terminology===
Music genre terms that contain &quot;world&quot; are commonly subject to a very ambiguous consumer definition, due to the confusing similarity and overlapping interpretation of these categories. The world music category is inherently diverse, and offers wide possibilities for application in hybrid form, especially in mainstream, market-driven music. Worldbeat as a small subgenre of popular music has a mounting consumer-perception as a hybrid subgenre of world music, to the chagrin of world music purists. In its context as a liberally termed subgenre under the world music umbrella, worldbeat is very similar to world fusion and global fusion. The distinctions that delineate these hybrid, &quot;world&quot; terms are slight, and in many ways they are still being defined.

==History==
In the mid-1980s, eclectic musician Dan Del Santo hosted a &quot;World Beat&quot; show for the Austin, Texas radio station KUT that popularized the term. Mainstream artists were incorporating world music influences into their sound and popularizing the &quot;world&quot; term at the time, notably David Byrne, Peter Gabriel (who launched in 1982 the renowned and still running WOMAD Festival (World Of Music Art and Dance) and Paul Simon. Initially, the most prominent influences came from Africa, Asia, South America (especially Brazil), the Middle East and Central America, though now encompass an ever-widening range of ethnic diversity. It has remained a thriving subgenre of popular and world music, while continuing to influence new artists, especially those appearing on today&#x27;s growing roster of indie record labels (artist examples cited in section 2 of this article). Some of worldbeat&#x27;s most successfully integrated folk elements include bossa nova, reggae, Afrobeat, mbaqanga, qawwali, highlife, rai, raga, Samba, flamenco and tango.
