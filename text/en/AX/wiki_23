<text>Flekkefjord () is a municipality in Agder county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Lister. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Flekkefjord. The villages of Sira, Gyland, Rasvåg, Kirkehavn, and Åna-Sira are located in Flekkefjord.

Flekkefjord is the westernmost municipality of the geographical region of Sørlandet. Flekkefjord is approximately midway between the cities of Kristiansand and Stavanger, located along European route E39 and the Sørlandet Line.

The municipality is the 198th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Flekkefjord is the 121st most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 9,216. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 1.7% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The small town of Flekkefjord was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1942, a part of the municipality of Nes (population: 377) was transferred to the town of Flekkefjord.

On 1 January 1965, there was a major municipal merger due to the work of the Schei Committee. On that date, the rural municipalities of Bakke (except the Øksendal area), Gyland, Hidra, and Nes were merged with the town of Flekkefjord, creating a new, much larger municipality of Flekkefjord with about 8,800 people. On 1 January 1987, the Virak and Espetveit areas of northern Flekkefjord (population: 41) were transferred to Sirdal municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (and town) is named after the local fjord called the &quot;Flekkefjorden&quot;. The first element of the name comes from the name of the old &quot;Flikke&quot; farm () since it is located near the fjord. That name is the plural form of the word which has an unknown meaning. The last element is which means &quot;fjord&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms for Flekkefjord are rather old (compared with most Norwegian municipal arms). They were granted around the year 1855. The blazon is &quot;Or, a sailing ship above four barrulets wavy gules&quot;. This means the arms have a field (background) has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The charge is a pilot boat above four wavy stripes symbolizing the sea. The arms have a mural crown above the shield. The arms were originally proposed in 1855 and they were described as a pilot boat on the sea. It specifically is like the pilot boats that Colin Archer made during that time period. The original proposal showed a boat on a very natural sea, using all in natural colours. The present shape of the boat and the more heraldically correct arms date from 1899. The arms were designed by an unknown designer. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. In 2023, the design of the arms was updated slightly. The flag on the boat was made to look more wavy, a single black stripe is on the sails, and a pilot is more visible at the rear of the boat.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has four parishes () within the municipality of Flekkefjord. It is part of the Lister og Mandal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark.

==Geography==
The municipality is located in southwestern Agder county, along the border with Rogaland county and the North Sea to the southwest. It is bounded by Sokndal and Lund municipalities (in Rogaland county) to the west across the river Sira, by Sirdal municipality to the north, and by Kvinesdal municipality to the east.

The town of Flekkefjord is located near the southern coast of the municipality in a fjord. It straddles the narrow sound which connects the Flekkefjorden to Grisefjorden. The port is ideal due to the tiny difference in tides experienced here. This is a result of its close proximity to the amphidromic point outside Eigersund.

The lakes Kumlevollvatnet, Lundevatn, Selura, and Sirdalsvatnet are located in Flekkefjord. The southern coast is dominated by the Listafjorden and Fedafjorden with the large inhabited islands of Hidra and Andabeløyna lying in the Listafjorden.

==History==


Flekkefjord was a landing place from early times. It was mentioned as a town as early as 1580. In 1589, James VI of Scotland landed there before travelling overland via Tønsberg to Oslo, where he married Princess Anne of Denmark, daughter of Frederick II. When Kristiansand was founded in 1641, Christian IV wanted to assure the economic survival of his new city by moving Flekkefjord residents there. Twice it was sentenced to extinction by royal decree. But many of the Flekkefjord inhabitants remained and continued to trade.

Norway&#x27;s plentiful stone was a Flekkefjord commodity. In 1736 over 300 Dutch ships are reported to have carried paving stones from Flekkefjord. By 1750 the herring fishery began in earnest, such that herring and timber dominated the trade. In the 1750s Flekkefjord was the most important Norwegian herring export harbor.

In 1760 Flekkefjord petitioned Frederik V to grant a town charter. At that time several ships were home ported there and both sailors and herring fishermen had their homes in this small town that was not officially recognized. Barrel making (cooperage) was also an important local trade that served the fishing fleet.

During the Napoleonic Wars Flekkefjord found a new life as a smugglers port, exporting oak to the Napoleon-occupied Netherlands during the period prior to 1807. The unusual tidal condition, the local timber abundance, and a long-term relationship with the Dutch were the reasons behind Flekkefjord&#x27;s then serving as a smuggler&#x27;s headquarters. They specialized in the lucrative oak trade, the warship timber in those days. Ships could come and leave Flekkefjord at any hour of the day, without concern for the tides.

Prior to 1807, Denmark-Norway had followed a policy of armed neutrality, using its naval forces only to protect trade flowing within, into, and out of Danish and Norwegian waters. But this changed for the last phase of the Napoleonic Wars when, in the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807, the British preemptively captured large portions of the Danish naval fleet to prevent the French from doing the same. As a result, the Danish government declared war and built small gunboats in large numbers to attack the British. The Gunboat War (1807–1814) was the title given to naval conflict between Denmark-Norway against the British navy. It was natural for Flekkefjord to move from a smuggler&#x27;s haven to blockade runner&#x27;s headquarters. The unusual tides there were unknown to the British warships that were blockading the Norwegian coast against Napoleon-supporting ships and this provided the blockade runners a considerable advantage.

After the war the Dutch maintained a strong presence in Flekkefjord, and continued exporting oak and pine. The pine was used mainly to make foundations for the boom in Amsterdam house construction; as a result most of Amsterdam&#x27;s houses from the 19th century are constructed of pines from Flekkefjord exporters. A section of Flekkefjord called &#x27;Hollenderbyen&#x27; (town of the Dutch) dates from the 18th century.

Xenotime, a rare yttrium phosphate mineral whose chemical formula is YPO4, was discovered in 1832 at Hidra (Hitterø), Flekkefjord.

The herring fisheries deserted the coast in 1838, depriving Flekkefjord residents of their main export. Tanning replaced fishing and by 1866 five tanneries were operating in Flekkefjord.

The Flekkefjord Line railway ran between Sira and Flekkefjord from 1904 to 1990.

Flekkefjord and nearby areas are served by Sørlandet Hospital Flekkefjord that covers population needs for surgery, orthopedics, oncology, gynecology and obstetrics.

==Government==
Flekkefjord Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Agder District Court and the Agder Court of Appeal.

===Municipal council===
The municipal council () of Flekkefjord is made up of 35 representatives that are elected to four year terms. The tables below show the current and historical composition of the council by political party.








===Parliamentary representation===
After Flekkefjord acquired market town status in 1842, it also became a constituency for elections to the Parliament of Norway. The first representative was elected in 1845: Gerhard Heiberg Garmann. He served for three years before Nils Elias Børresen was elected. He served until 1863, when deputy Johan Andreas Kraft took over for one year. Knud Geelmuyden Fleischer Maartmann served from 1865 to 1866 and 1868 to 1869, and Elias Didrichsen served from 1871 to 1888, interrupted by Thorvald Olsen who served from 1877 through 1879. Niels Eyde, Jakob Stang, Sivert Hanssen-Sunde and Hans Sivert Jacobsen served one three-year term each between 1889 and 1900. Then, Cornelius Bernhard Hanssen served from 1900 to 1921, interrupted by Bernhard Severin Sannerud in the years 1916 through 1918. A law change in 1919 repelled Flekkefjord as a constituency of its own; from then it was a part of the combined constituency Market towns of Vest-Agder and Rogaland counties.

===Mayors===
Mayors in Flekkefjord typically served for one year from the start of local government in 1838. Of the notable early mayors were Jens Henrik Beer (Parliament member before Flekkefjord became its own constituency) in 1840 and Anders Beer in 1843. Many of the parliamentarians served as mayors: J. A. Kraft in 1842, 1858 and 1859; Børresen in 1846, 1849, 1850, 1852 and 1862; Didrichsen from 1853 to 1857, 1863 to 1870, 1878 to 1879 and 1883 to 1888; Jacobsen in 1889; Hanssen-Sunde from 1893 to 1899; Sannerud from 1906 to 1909 and in 1917; and C.

<text>is a municipality in Agder county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Lister. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Farsund. Farsund is a coastal municipality in the far southwestern part of Norway, bordering Kvinesdal municipality in the north and Lyngdal in the north and east.

Loshavn with its wooden buildings is located outside the town of Farsund. Other villages in Farsund include Ore, Rødland, and Sande.

==General information==

The town of Farsund was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law), although it was already recognized as a trading center in 1795. The present municipality of Farsund was established on 1 January 1965 when the rural municipalities of Herad, Lista, and Spind were merged with the town of Farsund. On 1 January 1971, the &quot;Ytre og Indre Skarstein&quot; farms (population: 21) located along the western shore of the Rosfjorden were transferred from Lyngdal to Farsund.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Farsundet strait, a narrow strait through which the Lyngdalsfjorden passes as it goes by the town of Farsund. The first element of the name comes from the small island of Farøy which sits in the Farsund strait. The name of the island comes from the word which means &quot;travel&quot; or &quot;journey&quot; (similar to the English word &quot;farewell&quot; meaning &quot;good journey&quot;). The last element is which means &quot;strait&quot; or &quot;sound&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms has been used since 1900 or 1901. The blazon is &quot;Or, a mount surmounted by four linden trees vert&quot;. This means the arms have a field (background) has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The charge is a group of linden trees on a green hill. This design was chosen to represent the town of Farsund since there were four old linden trees on the town square. Originally, these trees grew in the garden of the Lund merchant dynasty, where they were probably planted in the middle of the 18th century. The trees also appear in the trade seal of the family. In 1957, the old trees were removed and replaced with new ones. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

<text>Mandal () is a former municipality in the old Vest-Agder county, Norway. It was located in the traditional district of Sørlandet. The municipality existed from 1964 until 1 January 2020 when the municipalities of Mandal, Lindesnes, and Marnardal were merged to form a new, larger municipality of Lindesnes in what is now Agder county. Mandal was the southernmost municipality in all of Norway, with the tiny skerry of Pysen being the southernmost point of land in Norway.

==General information==

The town of Mandal was established as a ladested municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 July 1921, a part of the neighboring municipality of Halse og Harkmark (population: 221) that was next to the town of Mandal was merged with the town. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Mandal (population: 5,446) was merged with the rural municipalities of Halse og Harkmark (population: 3,676) and Holum (population: 1,127) to form a new, large municipality of Mandal. On 1 January 1965, an unpopulated area of Mandal called Svalemyren was transferred to the neighboring municipality of Søgne.

On 1 January 2020, the three neighboring municipalities of Mandal, Marnardal, and Lindesnes will be merged into one large municipality called &quot;Lindesnes&quot; with its administrative centre being the town of Mandal.

===Name===
The municipality is named after the town of Mandal (), which in turn is named after the Mandalen river valley in which it is located. The first element is the genitive case of the river name &quot;Mǫrn&quot; which is now called Mandalselva. The meaning of this old river name is uncertain, but it may be derived from the word which means &quot;sea&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;.

Prior to 1653, the town of Mandal was named &quot;Vesterrisør&quot; (meaning &quot;western Risør&quot;). The name was originally referring to the island &quot;Risøya&quot; outside the town, and the first element was added in the 16th century to distinguish it from the town of &quot;Østerrisør&quot; (meaning &quot;eastern Risør&quot;), which is now simply called &quot;Risør&quot;. 

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 2 July 1921, just after Mandal became a town, and it was in use until 1 January 2020 when the municipality was dissolved. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, three salmon naiant argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is three salmon shown swimming horizontally and stacked vertically. The salmon have a tincture of argent which means they are commonly colored white, but if the arms are made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue color in the field and the salmon were chosen to symbolize the importance of salmon fishing on the river Mandalselva. Mandal is the southernmost municipality in Norway that has a large salmon population, so therefore, salmon fishing also played a major role in the economic development of the village and its trade with the rest of southern Norway. The municipality usually added a mural crown to the top of the arms to show that the municipality included the town of Mandal. The arms were designed by Hallvard Trætteberg. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has two parishes () within the municipality of Mandal. It is part of the Mandal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark.

Kristiansand is divided into five boroughs; -Grim, which is located northwest in Kristiansand with a population of 15,000; Kvadraturen, which is the centre and downtown Kristiansand with a population of 5,200; Lund, the second largest borough; Søgne, with a population of around 12,000 and incorporated into the municipality of Kristiansand as of January 2020; Oddernes, a borough located in the west; and Vågsbygd, the largest borough with a population of 36,000, located in the southwest.

Kristiansand is connected by four main roads: European Route E18 from Oslo, Aust-Agder, covering the easternmost parts of Kristiansand; European route E39 from Stavanger, Flekkefjord and the coastal towns and villages in Vest-Agder; Norwegian National Road 9 from Evje, Setesdal and Grim; and Norwegian National Road 41 from Telemark, northern Aust-Agder, Birkeland, Tveit and the airport Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik. Varodd Bridge is a large bridge and a part of E18, which stretches over Topdalsfjorden.

Tourism is important in Kristiansand, and the summer season is the most popular for tourists. Kristiansand Zoo and Amusement park is the largest zoo in Norway. It receives over 900,000 visitors every year. Markens Street is the main pedestrian street in downtown Kristiansand. Bystranda is a city beach located in Kvadraturen; Hamresanden beach is the longest beach in Kristiansand. Hamresanden Camping is a popular family aciivity during the summer season. The city hosts a free weekly concert in downtown Kristiansand in the summertime. Outside the city is the industrial park Sørlandsparken, which includes Sørlandssenteret, Norway&#x27;s largest mall.

==Name==
The city is named after the Dano-Norwegian King King Christian IV, who founded it on 5 July 1641. The second part of the city&#x27;s name, &quot;sand&quot;, comes from the Old Norse word which means &quot;sand&quot; or &quot;sandy ground&quot;. This refers to the sandy headland upon which the city was originally built. (See also: Lillesand#Name)

Historically, the name was usually written &quot;Christianssand&quot; until 1877, although the map of the mapmaker Pontoppidan from 1785 spelled the name &quot;Christiansand&quot; (with a single &#x27;s&#x27;). In 1877, an official spelling reform aimed at bringing city names into line with regular Norwegian orthography changed it to &quot;Kristianssand&quot;. Kristiansund and Kristiania (Oslo), also had their spellings changed under the same reform. Despite that, a number of businesses and associations retain the &quot;Ch&quot; spelling. The name was again changed to its present form, &quot;Kristiansand&quot; (single &quot;s&quot;), in 1889.

In 2012, the city&#x27;s mayor, Arvid Grundekjøn, proposed that the city be renamed Christianssand, arguing that &quot;Kristiansand&quot; is grammatically meaningless and that Christianssand stands for tradition. This proposal was not well received by the locals and the mayor has not pushed this further.

==History==

===Prehistory and early history===
The Kristiansand area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. In 1996, the well-preserved skeleton of a woman dating to approximately 6500 BC was discovered in Søgne in western Kristiansand. This demonstrates very early habitation of the archipelago. Grauthelleren (&quot;Grathelleren&quot;), located on Fidjane, is believed to be a Stone Age settlement. The first discovery in Norway of a Sarup enclosure (a Neolithic form of ritual enclosure first identified at Sarup on the Danish island of Funen) was made in 2010 at Hamresanden and dates to c. 3400 BC. Archaeological excavations to the east of Oddernes Church have uncovered rural settlements that existed during the centuries immediately before and after the start of the common era. Together with a corresponding discovery in Rogaland, these settlements are unique in the Norwegian context; isolated farms, rather than villages, were the norm in ancient Norway. Other discoveries in grave mounds around the church, in the Lund section of the city, indicate habitation beginning c. 400 AD, and 25 cooking pits that were found immediately outside the church wall in 1907 are probably even older. One of the largest pre-Christian burial grounds in South Norway was formerly located to the south and west of the church. A royal centre is thought to have existed at Oddernes before 800, and the church was built around 1040.

Before the stone church was built, one or perhaps two wooden post churches are believed to have stood on the same spot. A few years ago, excavations were carried out under and around the runestone when it was moved to the church porch; the grave finds indicated that the churchyard must already have been unusually large in the High Middle Ages. This means that the area must have had a large population before it was reduced by the Black Death.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, there was already a busy port and a small village on the Otra at the lowest point of today&#x27;s Lund neighbourhood (Lahelle). Another important element in the development of Kristiansand was the harbor on the island of Flekkerøy, which was the most important on the Skagerrak beginning in the 16th century and was first fortified under King Christian III in 1555. In 1635, King Christian IV ordered his feudal seigneur, Palle Rosenkrantz, to move from Nedenes and build a royal palace on the island.

===Foundation to 1900===

Christian IV (renowned for having founded many towns) visited the location in 1630 and 1635, and on 5 July 1641 formally founded the town of &quot;Christianssand&quot; on the &quot;sand&quot; on the opposite bank of the Torridalselva (Otra). The town was laid out in Renaissance style on a grid plan (the central section now known as &quot;Kvadraturen&quot; = The Quarters), and merchants throughout Agder were commanded to move to the new town. In return, they were to receive a variety of trading privileges and a ten-year tax exemption.

In 1666, Christianssand became a garrison town and was heavily fortified. In 1682, King Christian V decided to relocate the bishopric there from Stavanger. Hence, the young city became the main city of the Christiansand Stift.

Christianssand experienced its first fire in 1734, which was devastating to the city. Later in the 18th century, after the American Revolutionary War, the town&#x27;s shipbuilders experienced an economic boom that lasted until the Napoleonic Wars, which struck a severe blow to Kristiansand&#x27;s overseas trade. Denmark–Norway supported France in the conflict, and as a result Norwegian ports including Kristiansand were blockaded by the Royal Navy, as recounted in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Terje Vigen&quot;. By the 1830s, the town&#x27;s economy began to rebound, and the growth in the Norwegian shipping industry was important for Kristiansand. It was the only part of Norway where oak trees flourished, a major resource for the country&#x27;s shipbuilding industry. Large numbers of lobsters were collected off the coast and sent to London during the mid-19th century. The population of Kristiansand was about 12,000 people by 1848.

On 1 January 1838, the new formannskapsdistrikt law went into effect. This new law granted municipal self-government throughout Norway. As a city, it formed its own municipal government and it was surrounded by the rural municipality of Oddernes.

The City of Kristiansand had a quarantine station for maritime traffic and hospital at Odderøy Island for cholera patients that opened in 1804. The city had far fewer deaths than the surrounding area, largely attributable to the quarantine station and the hospital. For example, during the period of 1833–1866, Drammen had 544 cholera patients, of which 336 died. During this same period, Kristiansand only experienced 15 deaths from cholera.
Another important development during the 19th century was the foundation in 1881 of &quot; Sindssygeasyl&quot;, the second central psychiatric institution in Norway (after Gaustad). The psychiatric hospital drew highly specialized doctors to the city and also provided many jobs for women.

The most recent major fire, in 1892, left half the original section of the city in ashes. It burned buildings as far as the cathedral, which had been rebuilt in brick after a previous fire in 1880.

===1900 onward===
With the development of hydropower in southern Norway, the city gradually developed an industrial base, particularly with the establishment in 1910 of the nickel refinery Kristiansands Nikkelraffineringsverk AS (later Falconbridge Nikkelverk, now Glencore Nikkelverk). From an economic perspective, the First World War was a good time for Kristiansand, as a neutral shipping city. The crises that followed with the gold standard politics of the 1920s and the world economic crisis of the 1930s were also deeply felt in a trading city like Kristiansand.

On 1 July 1921, the city of Kristiansand got larger by annexing a part of the neighboring municipality of Oddernes, gaining 2,164 more residents along with more land for the growing city.

The labour movement had important pioneers in the city, and Leon Trotsky spent about a year of his exile in the archipelago offshore from Kristiansand. Arnulf Øverland took him from Randesund to Ny-Hellesund in Søgne in 1936. In the interwar period Kristiansand was a centre for intellectuals, especially after the architect Thilo Schoder settled there in 1932.

Kristiansand was attacked by German naval forces and the Luftwaffe during the Operation Weserübung on 9 April 1940. The naval forces met fierce resistance from Norwegian coastal artillery at Odderøya. Bombs and grenades also hit the downtown and the 70 meter high church tower of the Kristiansand Cathedral was hit by accident. The third attack attempt on the city succeeded because a signal flag was confused with a French national flag and the misunderstanding was not discovered until it was too late. The city was occupied by a force of 800 men.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1965, the city of Kristiansand (population: 27,100) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Randesund (population: 1,672), Tveit (population: 2,802), and Oddernes (population: 18,668) to create a much larger Kristiansand Municipality.

Post-war construction included further development of the Lund section, and in the 1960s and 1970s Vågsbygd to the west was developed into a section with 20,000 inhabitants. In the 1980s, industry and business in the city declined, in part because of the 1986 fire at the Hotel Caledonien. But beginning in the second half of the 1990s, business increased in momentum with the development of enterprises for marine and offshore equipment, security technology and drilling.

The older municipal archives for Kristiansand (and the former municipalities) are currently held at the Inter-Municipal Archives in Vest-Agder (IKAVA). This includes documents concerning, for example, local councils, chairmanships, poor boards, school boards and archives including among other things personal documents in the form of client records, tax records, and also school records.

On 1 January 2020, the three neighbouring municipalities of Kristiansand, Songdalen, and Søgne were merged to form one large municipality called &quot;Kristiansand&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The arms of Kristiansand were granted on 8 December 1909 and are based on the oldest seal of the city, dating from 1643. In 1643 King Christian IV granted the young town the right to use a seal with the Norwegian lion and the royal crown. The crown indicates that the city was founded by the king. The other major element in the arms is a tree. As the species of tree is not specified, there are several known versions with differently shaped trees. A second seal, from 1658, shows a tree with leaves and what look like pine cones. On the base of the crown are the letters R. F. P., standing for &quot;Regna Firma Pietas&quot;, &quot;Piety strengthens the realm&quot;; this was Christian IV&#x27;s motto. Around the seal of the city is its motto, &quot;Cavsa Triumphat Tandem Bona&quot;, &quot;A good cause prevails in the end&quot;.

==Geography==

Kristiansand is strategically located on the Skagerrak, and until the opening of the Kiel Canal between the North Sea and the Baltic was very important militarily and geopolitically. This meant that for centuries it served as a military stronghold, first as Harald Fairhair&#x27;s royal residence, then as a Danish-Norwegian fortress, and later as a garrison town. Kristiansand is a gateway to and from the continent, with ferry service to Denmark and a terminus of the railway line along the southern edge of South Norway. Geologically, this part of Agder is part of the Swedo-Norwegian Base Mountain Shield, the southwestern section of the Baltic Shield, and consists of two main geological formations of Proterozoic rocks that were formed in the Gothic and later Swedo-Norwegian orogenies, with significant metamorphism during the latter. There is a substrate of 1,600–1,450 million-year-old slate, quartzite, marble and amphibolite with some hornblende gneiss, and overlaid on this acidic surface structures of both granite and granodiorite (in general 1,250–1,000 million years old, in some places 1,550–1,480 million years old). The &quot;Bamblefelt&quot; geological area starts to the east of the municipality and extends to Grenland.

The last Swedo-Norwegian formations are evident in large formations of granite. There are also incidences of gabbro and diorite, less commonly eclogite. The Caledonian orogeny did not affect this area. Faults run southwest–northeast. In ancient times there was a volcano off Flekkeroy, which left deposits of volcanic rock just north of central Kristiansand, on the site of the estate of , now occupied by the Hospital of Southern Norway.

Near the city, there are deep woods. In Baneheia and at the former coastal artillery fortress on Odderøya, there are lighted ski trails and walking paths specially prepared for wheelchair users. People go swimming in Baneheia in the summer as well

Two major rivers, the Otra and the Tovdalselva, flow into the Skagerrak at Kristiansand.

===Climate===
Kristiansand has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). The coastal parts of the Skagerrak coast, which includes Kristiansand, is the sunniest part of Norway. Snow generally occurs in late December and in January and February; it may be heavy (the snow record at Kjevik airport is ) but rarely stays long on the coast; see Climate of Norway. Due to warming in the more recent decades, snow often melts after a few days.
In the summer most locals go to the Fiskebrygga, the archipelago opposite the city, and Hamresanden Beach, which is located about 10 minutes from the city centre near Kjevik airport. People from Denmark, Sweden, Germany, the UK and other European countries also visit this beach in the summer during their travels.

The all-time high at Kristiansand airport was recorded August 1975. The all-time low at the airport was recorded January 1982. The temperature seldom reaches , but most days in July reaches or more. The warmest month ever was July 1901 with mean at an earlier weather station (&quot;Kristiansand S - Eg&quot;). The warmest month at the airport was July 2018 with 24-hr average and average daily high . July 2018 was also the sunniest month on record with 422 sunhours, and the year 2018 recorded 2126 sunhours - despite December recording just 1 sunhr as cloudiest month on record in Kristiansand. The cloudiest July recorded 156 sunhours (2007). Kristiansand has the national record for the sunniest February (153 sunhrs in 1986), sunniest April (323 hrs in 2021), sunniest August (343 hrs in 1995) and sunniest September (241 hrs in 1959).
The wettest month on record was October 1976 with 560 mm precipitation, and the driest was April 1974 with no precipitation at all.

In Lund, there are traces of humans dating back to the early Iron Age, the Viking Age until the early Middle Ages various locations. There has been a settlement here since the Stone Age. During the Viking Age there was a great man&#x27;s farm here. A Runestone at Oddernes church provides a connection to this farm. A large field with burial mounds formerly existed south and west of the church, and may also be associated with this farm. In 1492 robbers from the sea came and attacked Lund. This is mentioned in two letters located in the National Archives. The letters describe the attack that took place with a lot of violence against both women and men and that on both sides suffered casualties. No one know who the robbers were, but their centurion was named Per Syvertsen. The name suggests that he and his crew came from Norway or Denmark.

<text>Drammen () is a city and municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. The port and river city of Drammen is centrally located in the south-eastern and most populated part of Norway. Drammen municipality also includes smaller towns and villages such as Konnerud, Svelvik, Mjøndalen and Skoger.

==Location==
Drammen is located west of the Oslofjord inlet, situated approximately 44 km (27 mi) southwest of the capital city of Oslo. There are more than 100,000 inhabitants in the municipality, though the city is the regional capital of an area with around 82,000 residents. Drammen, and its adjacent communities, are experiencing more socioeconomic and population growth than ever before. The city makes good use of the Drammensfjord, a waterway utilised for recreation, fishing and other activities, as well as waterfront housing.

==Name and coat of arms==
The Old Norse form of the city&#x27;s name was &quot;Drafn&quot;, and this was originally the name of the inner part of Drammensfjord. The fjord is, however, probably named after the river Drammenselva (Norse &quot;Drǫfn&quot;), and this again is derived from &quot;drǫfn&quot; f &#x27;wave&#x27;.
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 17 November 1960. The arms has a silver-colored column on top a silver-colored bedrock crossed with a silver-colored key and sword against a blue background. It is based upon the old seal dating from 1723 for Bragernes, one of the central parts of Drammen. The motto for Bragernes (in Latin) was &quot;In Fide Et Justitia Fortitudo&quot; (), and the items in the seal are referring to this: key = faith, sword = justice, column on rocks = strength.

== Governance ==
On January 1, 2020, the municipalities of Svelvik, Nedre Eiker and Drammen merged to form «The New Drammen Municipality». The new municipality, which is now called Drammen, is Norway&#x27;s seventh largest with over 100,000 residents. The main seat of the Greater Municipality is located in the city of Drammen.
Drammen city had a population of 82.875 inhabitants in 2021, but serves as a regional centre for an area that had a population of 110.236 inhabitants in 2021. The city is the country&#x27;s record champion in environment and urban development, 21 prices since 2003 with 16 national and 5 international.

===Districts===
After the merger of the municipalities Drammen, Nedre Eiker and Svelvik in 2020, the municipality was then divided into ten municipal regions: 

==History==
Rock carvings at Åskollen and Austad are 6000 to 7000 years old, and are the first signs of human activity in the area. The largest rock carving at Åskollen depicts a moose.

Drammen originally consisted of three small seaports: Bragernes (on the northern side of the Drammenselva river) and Strømsø and Tangen (both on the southern side of the river). For trade purposes, small seaports were placed under market towns. Despite their geographical proximity, Bragernes was placed under Christiania and Strømsø under Tønsberg. For this reason, cooperation between the adjacent seaport towns was almost impossible.

In 1662, a merger was proposed to unite Strømsø and Bragernes to form a market town with the name Frederiksstrøm. The proposal was rejected by King Frederick III. Bragernes received limited market town rights in 1715, and merged with Strømsø to gain status as a single city on 19 June 1811.

Its geographical location made the city favorable for seafaring, shipbuilding, log driving, timber trade. During the 19th century, paper and pulp industries were developed. Large parts of the city were ruined in the great fire of 12–13 July 1866, which led to the reconstruction of the city centre, including the characteristic town square and Bragernes church. The Drammen Line (&quot;Drammenbanen&quot; ) opened in 1872 providing rail service between Drammen and Oslo.

In 1909, Drammen got the first trolleybus system in Scandinavia, the Drammen trolleybus. The lines ran until 1967. For many years the centre of Drammen suffered from heavy traffic. In 1970, Drammen Bridge with two lanes on European route E18 was built (expanded to four lanes in 2006) and in 1999 the opening of the Bragernes tunnel (&quot;Bragernestunnelen&quot;) diverted additional traffic away from the centre of the city.

In recent years, the city centre has seen the introduction of new housing, shopping facilities, restaurants, cafes and bars, as well as a public pathway along the Drammenselva river.

In 2011, Drammen observed its 200th anniversary with many citywide jubilee celebrations. Drammen&#x27;s district heating system was upgraded to use water-sourced heat pumps, drawing on local fjord water, to support population growth in the city.

==Geography==
Drammen is one of the larger cities in Norway, and lies about from the capital of Norway, Oslo. The city centre lies at the end of a valley, on both sides of the Drammenselva river, and where the river meets the Drammensfjord. The Holmen island in Drammen is also the main harbor for car and fruit import in Norway.

The Drammen region is part of the metropolitan region around Oslo and the country&#x27;s fifth largest urban area, it extends far beyond the municipal boundaries; into the municipalities of Lier, Asker, Øvre Eiker and Holmestrand. The total population of the settlement is 110,236 inhabitants as of 1 January 2021.

In 2008 Drammen won the prestigious prize for the best city development in Europe.
==Climate==
Drammen has a humid continental climate (Dfb). Located at a sheltered location at the head of a narrow fjord branch of innermost Oslofjord, Drammen is one of the warmest cities in Scandinavia in summer. The warmest month on record was July 2018 with mean , average daily high and 11 days with highs at or above . The all-time high was recorded August 3, 1982, and is a tie with the national high for the month. The September record high is the national record. The all-time low was recorded in January 1987, which is the coldest month on record with mean and average daily low . In more recent years, December 2010 was almost as cold. The average date for first overnight freeze (low below ) in autumn is 13 October (1981–2010 average). The Drammen-Berskog weather station has been operating since 2004. An earlier weather station named Drammen-Marienlyst (3 m) operated from 1966 to 2003.

<text>Kongsberg () is a historical mining town and municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. The city is located on the river Numedalslågen at the entrance to the valley of Numedal. Kongsberg has been a centre of silver mining, arms production and forestry for centuries, and is the site of high technology industry including the headquarters of Norway&#x27;s largest defence contractor Kongsberg Gruppen.

Kongsberg, formerly spelled Konningsberg ( &quot;King&#x27;s Mountain&quot;), was developed as a mining city on the basis of the Kongsberg Silver Mines, founded by and named after King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway in 1624. The king invited German engineers and other specialists from Saxony and the Harz region to help build the mining company. As a mining city, Kongsberg had a distinct urban culture that contrasted with its surroundings, strongly influenced by the traditions of mining communities in Germany and where the German language was extensively used in mining business and for religious services. In the first years nearly half of the city&#x27;s population were German immigrants, and the majority of the engineers and executives were German immigrants and their descendants well into the 19th century, becoming a distinct social class called mining families that formed the educated social elite of Kongsberg in contrast to the Norwegian farming population; the first Nobel laureate in economics Ragnar Frisch belonged to such a Kongsberg mining family. By the 18th century Kongsberg was Norway&#x27;s second largest city, second only to Bergen. Kongsberg was one of Norway&#x27;s two privileged mining cities and thus formed a special mining jurisdiction (&quot;Bergstad&quot;), and only became part of Buskerud county in 1760. On 1 January 1838, the new national law, creating local governments, made Kongsberg a municipality. The rural municipalities of Ytre Sandsvær and Øvre Sandsvær were merged into the municipality of Kongsberg in 1964. Kongsberg gradually lost importance to other cities in the 19th century, particularly to the rapidly growing capital of Christiania (Oslo).

The Kongsberg Silver Mines closed in 1958 after operating for 334 years and is today a museum and the city&#x27;s main tourist attraction. Kongsberg remains the site of the Royal Norwegian Mint (), which mints Norwegian coins and also produces circulating and collectors&#x27; coins for other countries. Kongsberg is also the home of Norway&#x27;s major defence contractor, Kongsberg Gruppen, founded in 1814. Two of its best-known products were the Kongsberg Colt and the Krag–Jørgensen rifle.

Both the University of South-Eastern Norway Kongsberg campus, and Tinius Olsen&#x27;s school, a combined technical vocational college and secondary school, are located in Kongsberg.

==History==


Kongsberg was founded by Danish-Norwegian King Christian IV as a mining community in 1624 after the discovery of silver. In its second year, the town of Kongsberg and the Kongsberg Silver Mines began. According to official records, silver was first discovered by the shepherds children Helga Verp and Jacob Grosvold in the summer of 1623. However, the existence of deposits of precious metals was known previously, as evidenced by indications of earlier silver mining. With the rise of silver mining, Kongsberg became the largest industrial center in Norway before the industrial revolution. At the peak of silver mining in the early eighteenth century, Kongsberg&#x27;s silver mines and related industries contributed 10% of the Denmark–Norway gross national product.

To develop the Kongsberg Silver Mines, Christian IV hired Germans from the silver mines of Saxony and Harz and brought in Germans from other mines in Norway. The Germans brought their knowledge of mining technology, especially important during the start-up phase. Before 1623, the city was located in the royal territory of Sandsvær.

Four years after the establishment of the Kongsberg Silver Mines, most of the 1,500 workers and officials were still German. Gradually, Norwegians entered the workforce and were hired as supervisors. In 1636, 1,370 Germans and 1,600 Norwegians were employed there. In 1648, there were 1,500 Germans and 2,400 Norwegians working in Kongsberg.

Gunpowder was officially introduced in mining in 1681. Mining in the particularly hard rock of Kongsberg Mountain was energy intensive, so the silver mine continued to develop new technology to reduce production costs. A large artificial dam powered the mine&#x27;s hoists before electricity was introduced. In 1624, a road from Hokksund to Kongsberg was built to serve the Kongsberg Silver Mines, the most important road built in Norway in the 17th century. In 1665, the road was extended to Kristiansand and Larvik.

By 1683, the mining industry was an important industry of the state. The rapid development of Kongsberg meant that the number of workers in the city had increased significantly by the end of the 17th century. The proportion of Norwegians in the workforce increased, but for a long time, the main staff was dominated by Germans. Kongsberg was almost an outpost of Germany in Norway: the mine had a German name, and the official language was German, only later becoming bilingual (German and Danish). In Kongsberg, the German mountain justice system was also used. Legally, this means that the city was bound by independent regulations, partially separating the mining community from the country&#x27;s legal system. The Germans brought with them the Knappschaft, a guild-like association of miners that provided including free medical assistance, a pension plan, worker sick leave and a Saturday break. The ring agriculture characteristic of Kongsberg may also have been inspired by the German pattern.

The proceeds from silver mining provided a valuable assistance to the tight finances of Denmark. Denmark–Norway relied heavily on the silver of Kongsberg to support an ongoing war against Sweden. Precious metals also became more and more important in the currency, and to get closer to its source of raw materials, the Royal Mint moved in 1686 from Akershus to Kongsberg. During the Great Northern War in 1716, the city became the main target of Karl XII&#x27;s foray into Norderhof.

Kongsberg was particularly known for its Kongsberg Silver Mines and their high purity. Kongsberg&#x27;s ore also contained a certain amount of gold and large amounts of copper, cobalt, lead-zinc and fluorite. Roughly of silver was extracted between the discovery of the silver ore seams in 1623 and the last year of mining in 1957. The workforce at the Kongsberg silver mine began to increase substantially at the end of the 17th century. In the 1769 census, the mines employed about 4,000 workers. With 8,000 inhabitants in all, the town was the second largest in Norway, after Bergen (and thus larger than today&#x27;s capital, Oslo).

In Norway&#x27;s 1749 census, Kongsberg was the most populous town in Eastern Norway. It was granted its royal charter of trade—amounting to official township—in 1802. Following several hard years with reduced silver output from the mines, the war of 1807–1814, and a severe town fire in 1810 where 56 houses on the west side were destroyed, mining was complemented by the government establishing a defense industry in 1814. By 1835, the population had declined to 3,540.

Kongsberg is home to the Royal Norwegian Mint (), which mints Norwegian coins and also produces circulating and collectors&#x27; coins for other countries such as Israel. It was established in 1686, and was renamed from the &quot;Royal Norwegian Mint&quot; () in 2004 after having been sold to private investors (the Mint of Finland and Norwegian company Samlerhuset) in 2003. Kongsberg is also the site of the Kongsberg School of Mines (&quot;Kongsberg Bergseminar&quot;), an academic institution for mining technology which operated from 1757 to 1814.

During peaceful times, the defence industry gradually evolved into many other kinds of high tech activities as well, now dominating the town&#x27;s employment. In 1987, however, the state-owned Kongsberg Weapons Factory (&quot;Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk&quot;) suffered a major financial crisis as well as accusations of breaching the CoCom rules by selling sensitive technology to the Soviet bloc. As a result, the company was split into several smaller units and partly sold to private investors. Today, the separate firms thrive as one of Norway&#x27;s main high-tech industrial clusters, centering on the defence and maritime company Kongsberg Gruppen which is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

On 13 October 2021, a man stabbed multiple people with a bladed weapon, killing five and injuring three. Police subsequently apprehended a suspect whom the Kongsberg police chief later told reporters was a Muslim convert.

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms is from modern times and was designed by Hallvard Trætteberg. They were granted on 25 August 1972. They are based upon the old seal for the city from 1689 which shows the Roman god Janus dressed as an emperor (to represent the king); the sword and the pair of scales represents justice. The colour green represents the forests, silver represents the mountains, and gold represents wealth.

==Geography==
Kongsberg is located at the mouth of the valley Numedal; farther to the South the valley is called Lågendalen.

The neighbouring municipalities of Kongsberg are Flesberg to the north; Øvre Eiker and Hof to the east; Lardal, Siljan, and Skien to the south; and Sauherad and Notodden to the west. Of these, the two first lie in Buskerud county like Kongsberg, while Hof and Lardal lie in Vestfold, and the others lie in Telemark. The town is divided by the river Numedalslågen, which has three waterfalls in the town itself.
==Climate==
Kongsberg has a humid continental climate (Dfb), with late summer and autumn as the wettest season and February – April as the driest season. Kongsberg has warm summers by Norwegian standards; average daily highs in summer are comparable to Oslo. In winter Kongsberg is colder than Oslo, and snow cover on the ground is common. The largest snow depth recorded is 123 cm on 3 March 2006.The all-time high temperature was recorded 19 June 1970, while 10 August 1975 recorded . The all-time low was recorded 3 January 1941. As pr January 2022, all monthly record lows are old, 11 from before 1950. All record highs are from after 1950, 5 of 12 from after 2000 (pr January 2022). Kongsberg has recorded as early as 14 May (in 2000). The weather station Kongsberg brannstasjon has recorded since 2003, extremes includes data from Kongsberg II, III and IV.
==Transportation==
The main highways are the E134, crossing Kongsberg east to west (and connected to the E18 to Oslo), and Norwegian national road 40 &quot;(Riksvei 40)&quot;, going north to south. The Sørland Line stops at Kongsberg Rail Station, with connection to local and regional bus lines.

==Culture==

With the population increase during the town&#x27;s silver mining heyday of the mid-eighteenth century came the need for a new church, which was built over a 21-year period and inaugurated in 1761. It has an austere red brick exterior, but a richly decorated baroque interior including unique chandeliers made at &quot;Nøstetangen&quot; Glass Works in neighbouring Hokksund. Kongsberg Church remains one of the largest in Norway with a seating capacity of 2,400.

The church&#x27;s original baroque-era pipe organ, made by renowned German organ builder Gottfried Heinrich Gloger in 1760–65, was fully restored by Jürgen Ahrend in 1999–2000 and reopened to great fanfare in January 2001. With its 42 voices, it is the largest baroque organ in Scandinavia. At the end of January each year, the Gloger Music Festival now draws a select crowd of artists and music lovers from all over the world.

Since 1964, Kongsberg has hosted Kongsberg Jazzfestival, an annual international jazz festival. Heavily sponsored by the local industry, prominent world acts such as B. B. King, Diana Krall, Ornette Coleman, Joshua Redman and John Scofield have played at the festival in recent years.

== Sport ==
The town is known for many great ski jumpers. Birger Ruud and his two brothers, as well as many other townsmen, such as Petter Hugsted, won numerous medals in Winter Olympics and other international championships in the 1930s and 1940s. The first ski jumping technique, the Konsberger was developed by Jacob Tullin Thams and Sigmund Ruud in Kongsberg, and was the most popular ski jumping technique from the late 1920s to the late 1950s. Their medals and equipment can be seen at the Kongsberg Skiing Museum (&quot;Kongsberg Skimuseum&quot;) which is co-located with the Norwegian Mining Museum (&quot;Norsk Bergverksmuseum&quot;) in central Kongsberg. Inventor of the modern ski binding, Norwegian-American skier and Olympic skiing coach Hjalmar Hvam, was born in Kongsberg in 1902.
Recent winter sports athletes of the Kongsberg region include Olympic snowboarders Stine Brun Kjeldaas, Silje Norendal and Halvor Lunn; cross-country ski sprinter Børre Næss of the village &quot;Efteløt&quot;; and ski jumper Sigurd Pettersen of nearby municipality Rollag (60 km/37 mi north of Kongsberg). A large ski centre for alpine skiing and snowboarding, with several lifts and ca 320 m of height difference has been in operation and gradually expanding since 1965. Kongsberg hosted the cross-country skiing parts of the 2006 Nordic skiing National Championships. The arranging sports club was IL Skrim, the ski tracks being located at Heistadmoen, a former military camp.

The local basketball team Kongsberg Miners is regarded one of the best teams in the country.

The 1978 World Orienteering Championships were held in Kongsberg.

Motorcycle speedway has been prominent in Kongsberg. The first track existed at the Kongsberg Idrettsparken and it held the final of the Norwegian Individual Speedway Championship in 1969. More recently speedway practices have sporadically been run on an oval track (known as Basserudåsen Speedway) constructed by the NMK Kongsberg, adjacent to the Kongsberg Motorsenter Gokart. This site also held the final of the Norwegian Championships in 1997, 1998 and 2003.

==The crowns in Håvet==

This attraction (&quot;Kronene i Håvet&quot;) is a site where Norwegian royal monograms have been carved into the mountainside overlooking Kongsberg to mark royal visits to the city. In June 1704 King Frederik IV visited Kongsberg and started a tradition that is still celebrated. King Frederik also arranged for the monograms of visits from earlier monarchs to be recorded as well.

The first monogram on the hillside property belonged to Christian IV who in 1624 founded Kongsberg at the site of the newly discovered silver deposits. His visit was followed by that of Frederik III (1648) and Christian V (1685). Christian VI and his Queen Sofie Magdalene (1733), Frederik V (1749), Oscar I (1845), Oscar II (1890), Haakon VII (1908), Olav V (1962) and most recently Harald V (1995).

<text>Ringerike is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Ringerike. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Hønefoss.

The municipality of Ringerike was created on 1 January 1964 after the merger of the town of Hønefoss and the rural municipalities of Hole, Norderhov, Tyristrand, and Ådal. However, the area of Hole was removed from the municipality of Ringerike on 1 January 1977 to become a separate municipality once again. The historic area of Ringerike included not just the modern municipality of Ringerike but also Hole and Krødsherad, Modum, and Sigdal.

==General information==

===Etymology===
The Old Norse form of this name was &quot;Hringaríki&quot;. The first element is (probably) the genitive plural of &quot;hringir&quot;, the name of an old Germanic tribe. The last element is &quot;ríki&quot; n &#x27;kingdom, reich&#x27;. (See also Romerike.)

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms were granted on 16 June 1967. The arms show a gold ring on a red background. The colours red and gold represent royalty and are the royal colors of Norway. The ring is a canting symbol and at the same time symbolises the unity of the area, which has been a separate entity (even considered a petty kingdom) since medieval times.


==Geography==
The municipality of Ringerike is bordered on the north by the municipalities of Sør-Aurdal and Søndre Land; on the east by Gran, Jevnaker, Lunner, and Oslo; in the south by Bærum, Hole, and Modum; and in the west by Krødsherad and Flå.

Lakes in the region include:
*Samsjøen
*Øyangen
*Sperillen
*Ullerentjernet
*Vestre Bjonevatnet

It is also home to mountain ranges, including Ådalsfjella.
==Climate==
Ringerike has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with relatively warm summers and cold winters, often with snow on the ground lasting for weeks. The all-time high was recorded July 2018. The all-time low was recorded January 2010.

==Economy==
Billions of Norwegian kroner has been invested (as of 2022) in infrastructure, as a result of a government order (&quot;oppdragsbrev&quot;) in 2015; the municipality had to do their part in regard to the project &quot;Ringerike Line&quot;; the national budget is not final yet (as of October 2022) and government money for the project has not yet been allocated.

Ringerike is famous for two agriculture products; Ringerike potato (&quot;Ringerikspotet&quot;) and Ringerike pea (&quot;Ringeriksert&quot;). Jens Aabel first started production of Ringerike potato around 1867. The Ringerike pea has obtained PDO (protected designation of origin). In June 2007, the Ringerike potato got &quot;protected geographical indication&quot; (PGI) under the name &quot;Ringerikspotet fra Ringerike.&quot; Six farmers are now producing and packing this special potato at Ask in Ringerike. Most of the potatoes are sold in the Oslo area.
The town was also home to the commercial operations of the Norwegian Mapping Authority which in 2004 divested these to the then Ugland IT Group, later renamed Nordeca. The offices were closed in 2010 with all operations moving to Lysaker due to increasing computerization of map-making.

<text>Hole is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Ringerike. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Vik. Hole is located around lake Tyrifjorden and extends to the woodland around Oslo. The soil is fertile and suited to growing fruit, berries and other agricultural products.

The municipality of Hole was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The annex of Tyristrand was separated from Hole on 1 July 1916 to become a municipality of its own. The municipality of Hole was merged into the neighboring municipality of Ringerike in 1964, however, this merger ended in 1977 when Hole was restored as a separate municipality.

Infrastructure: the road (E16) between Sandvika and Hønefoss has been Norway&#x27;s most deadly, for the ten-year period that ended in 2021; nine people died.

==Name==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Hole&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Hólar&quot;), since the first church was built there. The name is the plural form of &quot;hóll&quot; which means &quot;round (and isolated) hill&quot;.

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms is from modern times, as they were granted on 24 May 1985. The arms show four gold crowns on a red background. They are a symbol for the four Norwegian Kings who lived in the municipality in the 9th-11th centuries:

*Halfdan the Black lived during the 9th century married Ragnhild, the daughter of Sigurd Hart. Berserkers killed Sigurd Hart and subsequently kidnapped his daughter Ragnhild. Halfdan the Black saved Ragnhild and married her. King Halfdan the Black ended his life in 860 by going through the ice on Randsfjorden with his men, his horse, and sledge. His body-or some part thereof-was possibly buried at the Stein farm on &quot;Halvdanshaugen&quot; (&quot;The Mound of Halvdan&quot;).
*Sigurd Syr lived during the 11th century. He was the great-great-grandchild of Harald Hårfagre (900-940). Although a king, Sigurd Syr was mainly interested in agricultural matters, which was quite exceptional for a king at that time. His nickname &quot;Syr&quot; meant: &quot;The one who is digging in the field&quot;. He was known as a peaceful and very wise man. Sigurd Syr married the widow Åsta Gudbrandsdatter, who had a little son, Olav, today known as St. Olaf. Åsta and Sigurd Syr were the parents of Harald Hårdråde.
*St. Olav (or Olav Haraldsson) reigned from 1015 to 1030. His mother was the above-mentioned Åsta and his stepfather was King Sigurd Syr. However, Olaf Haraldsson&#x27;s real father was Harald Grenske, who had been killed in 995. His widow, Åsta, gave birth to Olaf at the same year, but we do not know for sure if Olaf was born at Harald Grenske&#x27;s place in Vestfold or in Hole. Olaf Haraldsson is one out of four saints in Norwegian history and world known.
*Harald Hårdråde reigned from 1046 to 1066 and was the half brother of Olaf Haraldsson. He was born at King Syr&#x27;s farm. As a king he was known for his tough rule. He was only 15 years old when he fought in the battle of Stiklestad in 1030 and experienced the death of his half brother.

==History==
Hole has an extensive and important role in Norwegian history. Archeological finds from the Roman and Migration periods are numerous. Hole is also known as one of the traditional landscapes from the Viking Age and plays a prominent role in the Norse sagas.

King Halfdan the Black of Vestfold conquered the Ringerike traditional district, including Hole, in about 830 AD. According to saga, when he died he was so popular that every district wanted his body. As a result, his body was quartered; his head was buried in the mound at the Stein estate in Hole. Halfdan the Black&#x27;s second wife, Ragnild from Hole, was the mother of the first king of Norway, Harald I of Norway (also known as Harald Fairhair).

Saint Olaf (king of Norway from 1015 to 1028) was born in Hole, near where the 12th century Bønsnes Church (&quot;Bønsnes kirke&quot;) is located, to Harold Grenske (a grandson of Harald I of Norway) and his wife Asta. Asta later remarried to Sigurd Syr, chieftain of Hole, and had a son born there named Harold, (&quot;Harald Hårdråde&quot;) who later became Harald III Sigurdsson (king of Norway from 1046 to 1066) .

Ringerkike&#x27;s famous poet, Jørgen Moe, was brought up on the &quot;Mo&quot; (or &quot;Moe&quot;) farm in Hole. Many of the fairy tales gathered by Asbjørnsen and Moe were collected in this area. Frognøya and Størøya are also important historical places in Hole.

On July 22, 2011, the Workers&#x27; Youth League summer camp, which took place on Utøya in Hole, was attacked as part of the 2011 Norway attacks.

==Geography==

The municipality of Hole is bordered on the north by Ringerike municipality, in the east by Bærum municipality and in the south by Lier municipality. South of the lake Tyrifjorden it also borders on Modum municipality. Most of the residents live in the villages of Sundvollen, Vik, Kroksund, Helgelandsmoen, Steinsåsen, Røyse, and Sollihøgda.

From the viewpoint &quot;Kongens utsikt&quot; which lies on Krokskogen, there are views of the landscape of Hole. The main road between Oslo and Bergen, European route E16, runs through the community.

==Government==
The current mayor is Per Ragnvald Berger (born 18 October 1952), representing &quot;Høyre&quot;, the Conservatives, reelected for 2011–2015. Berger is in for his fourth term and was first elected in 1999.

==Stein Church Ruins==

Stein Church Ruins (&quot;Stein kirkeruin&quot;) are located at Steinsfjorden. Originally constructed in the latter half of the 1100s, it was built of sandstone and limestone from the area. The chapel had a rectangular nave and narrower, very short choir area. The sanctuary had portals in the west and south. By the second half of the 1500s, the chapel was no longer in use. In the 1570s, the inventory had been transferred Hamar Cathedral.
==Bønsnes Church==
Bønsnes church (&quot;Bønsnes Kirke&quot;) is a small medieval era church. It is built of brick and was built in 1100. The church has rectangular plan and 80 seats. The church has conservation status protected. Bønsnes church has a later added wooden tower in front of the west gable. The tower is probably built in connection with repairs to the roof and masonry in the 1850s. In 1500s and 1600s the church decayed. It was only after it was enabled in 1728, it was brought back into use.

In 1790 the interior was given a new decor. Painted clouds are on the ceiling, the pulpit and the gallery. The altarpiece is probably from the 1700s, featuring the Crucifixion and the Last Supper, surrounded by leaf ornaments, columns and sculptures. The medieval interior has a Madonna sculpture from the 1200s and a crucifix from the 1400s.

==Hole Church==

Hole Church (&quot;Hole kirke&quot;) probably stems from approximately 1200. It is located in a hilly landscape around 5 km southwest of Norderhov Church on a peninsula in Tyrifjord. The edifice is of stone and has 350 seats. The altarpiece in the Rococo style.
It was largely destroyed by fire in 1736. The church was rebuilt in 1737. Repairs, restorations and remodeling occurred during 1827 and 1909. The old church burned to the ground after a lightning strike in 1943. The restored church is built by sandstone from the district and consists of a long, rectangular nave and a narrower, almost square choir in the east.

<text>Flå is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Flå. The municipality of Flå was established when it was separated from the municipality of Nes on 1 January 1905. The municipality lies at the most southeasterly point in the valley and traditional region of Hallingdal.

==General information==
===Name===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Flóða sokn&quot; (&quot;sokn&quot; means parish). This is the plural genitive case of &quot;flœð&quot; meaning &quot;flood&quot; (probably because flooding has been a problem for many farms in the river valley). Prior to 1921, the name was written &quot;Flaa&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 1 March 1985. The arms show a black bear on a gray/silver background. This was chosen because there used to be many bears in the Vassfaret area. Prior to 1985, the municipality used a logo with a bear walking through the area.

==History==
Ancient routes went to Vestlandet through Valdres and Hallingdal and down Røldal to Odda. Reflecting this route, Hallingdal and its neighboring valley of Valdres in Oppland to the north were originally populated by migrants from Vestlandet and spoke a western dialect. In recognition of this, Cardinal Nicholas Breakespear, who was in Scandinavia as papal legate in 1153, included Hallingdal in the diocese of Stavanger.

==Geography==
Flå is the southernmost municipality within Hallingdal and forms the gateway to Hallingdal from the south. Flå is bordered in the north by Sør-Aurdal, in the east by Ringerike, in the south by Krødsherad and Sigdal, in the west by Nore og Uvdal, and in the northwest by Nes. Travelers from the south pass through the 65 m long tunnel Hallingporten on Norwegian National Road 7 (&quot;Riksvei 7&quot;) just located north of Gulsvik.

Vassfaret is a forested mountain valley bordering Flå. The Norefjell mountain range also includes parts of Flå as well as Nes, Ringerike and Sør-Aurdal municipalities. Lake Krøderen (&quot;Krøderfjord&quot;) stretches about 41 km north from the village of Krøderen and reaches to Gulsvik. The Hallingdalselva river flows into the lake from the north. The area includes the Vassfaret and Vidalen Conservation area which includes Festningen Nature Reserve and Bukollen Nature Reserve as well as the Inner Vassfaret Conservation area which includes Bringen Nature Reserve.

== Notable people ==
* Kolbjørn Buøen (1895–1975) a Norwegian actor 
* Fredrik Gulsvik (born 1989) a Norwegian former footballer with over 100 club caps

==Attractions== 
Bjørneparken is located on Vikberget in Flå. The park is a sanctuary featuring various animals including bears, elk, deer, wolf, and lynx.

==Protected areas==
* Bringen Nature Reserve, established 28 June 1985
* Bukollen Nature Reserve, established 28 June 1985

<doc id="178152" wikidata="Q483986" url="?curid=178152" title="Nesbyen (municipality)">
<text>Nesbyen is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Hallingdal. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Nesbyen.

The parish of &quot;Næs&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The area of Flå was separated from Nes on 1 January 1905 to become a separate municipality.

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Nes&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Nes&quot;—now the village of Nesbyen), since the first church was built there. The name is identical with the word &quot;nes&quot; which means &quot;headland&quot;. Prior to 1889, the name was spelled &quot;Næs&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 29 June 1979. The arms show a yellow-gold triangle pointing to the left on a red background. This represents a sandy peninsula or headlands (yellow triangle) formed by the confluence of two rivers: Rukkedøla and Hallingdalselva. The design is canting because this is what the name of the municipality means (see above under the name).

==History==
Ancient routes went to Vestlandet through Valdres and Hallingdal and down Røldal to Odda. Reflecting this route, Hallingdal and its neighboring valley of Valdres were originally populated by migrants from Vestlandet and spoke a western dialect. In recognition of this, Cardinal Nicholas Breakespear, who was in Scandinavia as papal legate in 1153, included these two valleys in the diocese of Stavanger.

==Geography==
The municipality lies in the valley and traditional district of Hallingdal. It is bordered on the north by the municipality of Gol, on the east by Sør-Aurdal, on the southeast by Flå, on the southwest by Nore og Uvdal, and to the west by Ål.

The majority of the residents live in the villages of Nesbyen, Espeset, Eidal, Sjong, Børtnes, Bromma, Svenkerud, and Liodden.

==Climate==
Nesbyen has a boreal climate, bordering on a humid continental climate, with fairly warm and pleasant summers and cold winters. On 20 June 1970, Nesbyen recorded the all-time high for Norway ; the record low was recorded 13 January 1914. The weather station Nesbyen-Todokk started recording in 2003; there have been weather stations in Nesbyen recording temperature since 1897.


==Attractions==

Hallingdal Museum (&quot;Hallingdal Folkemuseum&quot;) is located in Nesbyen. Hallingdal Folk Museum, founded in 1899, is one of the oldest open air museums in Norway. It has a large and unique collection of buildings and artifacts from farms in Hallingdal. Special mentions is houses like &quot;Staveloftet&quot;, built around 1340, from the &quot;Stave&quot; farm and &quot;Trøymstua&quot; from about 1645, coming from Hemsedal.

There is an old meteor crater just north of Nesbyen (about 6 kilometres north and then 4 kilometres into the woods). About 650 million years ago, a meteorite struck this area. This resulted in a impact crater and an enormous amount of outpouring of energy by the impact.

<doc id="178153" wikidata="Q493301" url="?curid=178153" title="Gol, Norway">
<text>Gol () is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Hallingdal. The administrative center of the municipality is the village of Gol which is also the population center. Gol was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The area of Hemsedal was separated from Gol in 1897 to become a separate municipality. The municipality of Gol is bordered to the north by the municipality of Nord-Aurdal (in Oppland county), to the east by Sør-Aurdal (in Oppland county), to the south by Nes, and to the west by Ål and Hemsedal.

==General information==

===Name===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Gǫrð&quot;. This is probably an old river name (for the lower part of Hemsil river). The name of the river maybe derived from the word &quot;garðr&quot; m &#x27;fence; border&#x27; - and the meaning is then &#x27;the border river&#x27;.

===Coat-of-arms===

The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 13 September 1985. The arms are gold with three black keys in the center. The keys are derived from the key for Gol stave church. 

===Transport===
The Bergen Line from Bergen to Oslo runs through Gol Station which opened in 1907. Gol is connected to Norwegian National Road 7, 50 and 52 as well as Norwegian county road 51. There are daily bus connections to Gjøvik and Lillehammer.

==Gol Church==
Gol Church (&quot;Gol kirke&quot;) was constructed during 1882 based upon a design by architect Henrik Nissen. The church is characterized by neo-Gothic style with gables and small towers with crosses. It was built of wood and has 500 seats.

The mediaeval Gol stave church (built ca. 1216) was due for demolition after the construction of the larger and new church. Gol stave church was saved from destruction by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments (&quot;Fortidsminneforeningen&quot;), which bought the materials with the intention of re-erecting the church elsewhere. Financial problems were solved when King Oscar II decided to pay for its relocation and restoration as the central building of his private open-air museum near Oslo.

The restoration was overseen by architect Waldemar Hansteen. It was completed in 1885. In 1907, the royal museum was merged with the Norsk Folkemuseum, which now manages the stave church, still nominally belonging to the reigning monarch.

==Attractions==
*Gordarike Familiepark is a theme park located in downtown Gol. The theme and environment are built to reflect the Viking Age and Middle Ages. A modern replica of Gol stave church has been built as a tourist attraction at the park. The replica was built in the 1980s and consecrated in 1994.
*Gol Bygdetun is an open-air museum located in the village of Gol. It was built around the old &quot;Skaga&quot; farm. It is dedicated to the cultural history of Gol, and contains farm buildings of nearly all types.

<text>Hemsedal is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Hallingdal. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Trøym. Hemsedal lies on the Norwegian National Road 52 (Rv 52). Hemsedal is located northwest of Oslo and from Bergen. In 1897, Hemsedal was separated from the municipality of Gol to become a municipality of its own.

==General information==
===Name===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Hemsudalr&quot;. The second element is &quot;dalr&quot;, which means &quot;dale&quot; or &quot;valley&quot;; the first element is usually taken as the genitive case of the river name &quot;Hemsa&quot; (now Hemsil) of unknown derivation, although Sophus Bugge believed that it might derive from the Old Norse &quot;hemsa&quot;, &quot;hefnsa&quot; or &quot;hofn&quot;, meaning &quot;going to pasture&quot;. The Norwegian word &quot;hems&quot; (&quot;bed built in a small loft room&quot;) is named after the valley of Hemsedal.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms is from modern times. The arms were granted on 2 October 1992 and were designed by Stein Davidsen. The arms show a gold lynx head on a red background. 

==History==


===Early history===

Hemsedal stave church (&quot;Hemsedal stavkyrkje&quot;) is believed to have been built between 1207 and 1224, and is first mentioned, as &quot;Ecclesia Aamsodal&quot;, in the accounts and diaries of the Papal nuncios sent to Scandinavia to collect tithes in 1282–1324. In 1327 it was also mentioned under the name &quot;Skodvinar Kirkja i Hemsudali&quot;; this refers to alternate names of the farm where it stood, &quot;Kyrkjebøen&quot;: &quot;Skodvin&quot; and &quot;Skadengård&quot;. The church was dismantled in 1882.

Hemsedal Church (&quot;Hemsedal kyrkje&quot;) was built during 1882 as a replacement for Hemsedal stave church. It was constructed of wood on the basis of plans by architect Johannes Henrik Nissen. It has 500 seats. The organ was built in 1888 by Olsen &amp; Jørgensens orgelfabrikk and was restored in 1976. The church is associated with the Hallingdal deanery of the Diocese of Tunsberg.
Hemsedal&#x27;s economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. The valley had small and medium-sized farms that were widely scattered on the valley bottom on both sides of the river and along the slopes. Because of the high altitude, farming has concentrated for the most part on livestock and dairy, and use of summer shielings has been important for the farms, which could not find sufficient pasturage in the valley bottom. Most therefore had milking stations on the shielings.

In the 1647 cadastre there was only one farm in Hemsedal large enough to pay full taxes; there were 24 liable for half taxation and 15–16 assessed as disused. In addition, there were a number of enterprises that were not assessed tax. The estimated population was about 400 (the exact number is unknown). Until the mid-19th century, the population increased steadily. In 1845 there were 1,775 people in the village. However, the population declined again over the next 75 years. In 1920 it had fallen to 1,358, before once more starting to increase.
===Recent history===

Skogstad Hotell was completed in 1905 as the first hotel in the village. Before that, in the latter half of the 19th century, a road had been built through the village with the hope that it would become a major route to Western Norway. However, things changed dramatically with the opening of the Bergen Railway in 1909. Hemsedal once more became a detour, while upper Hallingdal took over as the main route.

After the World War II, new places to stay were established in the valley, such as Vangen Pensjonat (inn) at Tuv (1947) and Lykkjaheim Pensjonat (1953). A tourist agency was established in 1939 and in 1952 suggested building a ski lift in Hemsedal, but this did not happen until 1959, when Fossheim Pensjonat created the Tottenheisen, a ski lift behind the inn at Ulsåk, serving the first piste in the village, Tottenløypa. However, this lift was torn down in 1961.

Hemsedal Skisenter opened at Holdeskaret in 1961, and a few years later, planning began for tourist development. Over the five years beginning in 1980, a series of new businesses aimed at tourists were established. The first chairlift, Olaheisen, opened in 1983. Tourism has continued to grow in economic significance for Hemsedal. More than half of visitors come from abroad. Hemsedal is now also popular in the summer season, due to opportunities for fishing, hiking, climbing, cycling, golf and other activities.

==Geography==
The municipality is bordered to the north by Vang and Vestre Slidre (both in Oppland county), to the east by Nord-Aurdal (in Oppland county) and Gol, to the south by Ål and Hol, and to the west by Lærdal (in Vestland county). Lakes in the region include Juklevatnet.

One of the first tourists in Hemsedal was the Norwegian polar explorer Fritjof Nansen, who visited in 1898 and stayed at the Bjøberg Fjellstue. Today Hemsedal is a popular destination, with Hemsedal Skisenter the main attraction. About 70% of all visitors come in the winter season (December–May) and most of the remaining 30% in the summer months.

<text>Ål is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Hallingdal. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Ål.
The parish of &quot;Aal&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The area of Hol was separated from the municipality of Aal in 1877 to become a separate municipality.

== Geography ==

Ål borders the municipalities of Hol, Gol, Hemsedal, Nes, Nore og Uvdal, and Lærdal.

The Bergen Line, the rail line between Oslo and Bergen runs through Ål. Ål Station has an elevation of and is the halfway station on the Bergen Line.

Hallingdalselva runs in the bottom of the main valley, forming Strandafjorden, a long, narrow lake for several kilometers. Ål has several hydroelectric dams. Hallingdalselva runs partly in a tunnel from here to Nes municipality, where it drives a large turbine power plant.

== General information ==
Approximately 5,000 inhabitants spread over several smaller villages including Ål, Torpo, Leveld, Vats, Trillhus, Granhagen, Breie and Strand. There is a strong cultural tradition, with folk music being a big part of people&#x27;s identity. Folkemusikkveka is held every May for a week.

The traditional industry of Ål is mostly small-farming. Many livestock farms are still in operation with small herds of sheep, dairy cattle, and goats. Crop growing is difficult because of the steep valley walls, but wheat, barley, rye, and potatoes have all been grown in the past.

The award-winning local paper &quot;Hallingdølen&quot; has offices in the village of Ål. It comes on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Ål has a Videregående school and a Folkehøyskole for deaf students.

=== Name ===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Áll&quot;. The name is identical with the word &quot;áll&quot; which means &quot;ditch&quot; or &quot;gully&quot;. In 1921, the spelling of the name was changed from &quot;Aal&quot; to &quot;Ål&quot;.

=== Coat-of-arms ===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. The arms were granted on 30 November 1984 and show three silver diamond shapes in a vertical line on a red background. The designs are taken from an old and common pattern used in hand-woven tapestries in the area. They also symbolize the three churches in the municipality: Ål, Torpo, and Leveld.

<doc id="178157" wikidata="Q486726" url="?curid=178157" title="Sigdal">
<text>Sigdal is a municipality in Buskerud County, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Prestfoss.

The municipality of Sigdal was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The area of Krødsherad was separated from Sigdal on 1 January 1901. The municipality has common borders with the municipalities of Flå, Krødsherad, Modum, Øvre Eiker, Flesberg, Rollag, and Nore og Uvdal.

==Name==
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Sigmardalr&quot; or &quot;Sigmudalr&quot;. The first element is the genitive case of a river name &quot;Sigm(a)&quot; (now called the Simoa) and the last element is &quot;dalr&quot; which means &quot;valley&quot; or &quot;dale&quot;. The Simoa river runs through Sigdal, flowing in a south-easterly course until it flows into Drammenselva at Åmot in Modum. The meaning of the river name is unknown, but is maybe derived from &quot;síga&quot; which means to &quot;ooze&quot; or &quot;slide&quot;.

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 18 November 1983. The arms show a heraldic image of the mountain that dominates the view around the village, the Andersnatten. The profile of the mountain is yellow with a blue-colored sky above.

==Geography and population==
Most of the citizens live in the village of Eggedal or the administrative centre of Prestfoss. Sigdal is densely populated, dominated by mountains and valleys.

About 72% of the area is covered with forest, 20% is mountain areas, and 4% of the area is cultivated. Agriculture, forestry, and the kitchen-producing enterprise of &quot;Sigdal Kjøkken&quot; are still important industries.

== Climate ==
Sigdal has a humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;), near subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), &quot;Dsb&quot;, and &quot;Dsc&quot; (the dry-summer versions, respectively) at once. The average summer high is 69 F, and the average winter low is 20 F. Snowfall in winter is fairly reliable, at 68 days per year on average, and rainfall peaks in summer and early fall. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in Sigdal are 93 F (34 C) in July and-11 F (-24 C) in February, respectively.

==Local Attractions==

<text>Krødsherad (&quot;Krødsherad kommune&quot;) is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Noresund. The municipality of Krødsherad was established when it was separated from the municipality of Sigdal on 1 January 1901.

==General information==

===Name===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Krœðisherað&quot;. The first element is the genitive case of the name of the lake Krøderen, the last element is &quot;herað&quot; meaning &quot;district&quot;. Prior to 1918, the name was spelled &quot;Krødsherred&quot;. 

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 11 September 1981. The arms are supposedly canting arms. In older times, the name, &quot;Krødsherad&quot;, was commonly misunderstood as the word &quot;kross&quot; meaning &quot;cross&quot; or the area where two valleys crossed. Thus the saltire cross was taken as a symbol in the arms. New insights, however, derive the name from Krøderen, or a lake with a sharp curve (hooked-lake).

==Geography==
The district lies on the Krøderfjord in Hallingdal, and borders on the municipalities of Ringerike, Flå, Sigdal and Modum. The municipality lies only 10 old Norwegian miles from Oslo. Settlement is scattered, with some concentration around the municipality&#x27;s two principal centers, Noresund situated on the east side of Lake Krøderen and Krøderen at the southern end of Lake Krøderen.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the primary industry with most agricultural land arable and mostly used for grain cultivation. The forestry industry also has historically been important. With the shoreline at Krøderen and the high mountains at Norefjell, the municipality enjoys a spectrum of natural environments from lake to mountain. As a result, there are many vacation homes in the municipality and tourism, especially winter sports in the Norefjell area, is an important contribution element in the economy.

==Attractions==
===Villa Fridheim===

Villa Fridheim, a manor house which houses a folk museum, is one of Norway&#x27;s largest timber buildings. The style is representative of romantic nationalism. The building was erected in 1890-92 as the country house of Drammen based timber merchant Svend Haug(1832-1891) and his wife Anne Marthea (Thea) Sveaas (1839-1924). The architect was Herman Major Backer (1856–1932), whose other commissions included Skaugum in Asker, Klemetsrud Church in Oslo, Sollihøgda Chapel in Hole and St John&#x27;s Church in Bergen.

The building functioned as a hotel and boarding house between 1914-60. The building was restored and opened as a folktale museum in the summer of 1986. In 1996 the museum opened a section dedicated to the great collectors of Norwegian fairy tales, Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe and to noted illustrators Theodor Kittelsen and Christian Skredsvig.

=== Krøderbanen ===
Krøderbanen Museum (&quot;Museet Krøderbanen&quot;) is a railroad museum headquartered in the former Krøderen Railroad Station at Krøderen. Krøderbanen was opened in 1872 as a narrow gauge line. It was converted to standard gauge in connection with the Bergen Railway opening in 1909 and remained in operation until 1985. Both rolling stock and fixed installations along the line is kept in running condition. Krøderbanen is also a center for the restoration and maintenance of railway equipment.

===Norefjell Ski Resort===
Norefjell Ski Resort was host to the downhill and giant slalom competitions of the 1952 Winter Olympics. Norefjell is only a 90-minute drive away from Oslo, making the ski resort the closest high mountain area to the Norwegian capital.

===Olberg Church=== 
Olberg Church (&quot;Olberg kirke&quot;) dates from 1859. Jørgen Moe, who was the chaplain from 1853 to 1863, committed himself to having a new church built at Krødsherad. It was constructed based upon designs by architect Gustav Adolph Lammers. The building was built of wood and has 600 seats. The new church was dedicated on October 19, 1859. It is part of the Church of Norway and belongs to Eiker Prosti in the Diocese of Tunsberg.

<text>Øvre Eiker is a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Eiker. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Hokksund. The old municipality of Eiker was divided into &quot;Øvre Eiker&quot; (upper Eiker) and &quot;Nedre Eiker&quot; (lower) on 1 July 1885.

As of 2015, more employees worked for the [municipal] government and in the service sector, than in any other field of employment; even fewer—16 %—are employed in construction or in [electrical] power companies and water companies; [13%] work in the manufacturing sector.

==General information==
===Name===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Eikjar&quot;. The name is the plural form of &quot;eiki&quot; which means &quot;oak wood&quot;. The meaning of &quot;Øvre Eiker&quot; is &quot;(the) upper (part of) Eiker&quot;. (The municipality of Eiker was divided in 1885.) 

===Coat-of-arms===

<text>Røyken is a district and village (&quot;bygd&quot;) and a former municipality in Buskerud in Viken County, Norway. In 2020 Røyken was merged with the municipalities of Hurum and Asker to form the new Asker Municipality (informally called &quot;Greater Asker&quot;) located in the newly formed Viken county. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Midtbygda. The parish of &quot;Røken&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

Oslo ATCC, the Area Control Center for the controlled airspace above Østlandet is located here.

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Røyken&quot; farm (Norse &quot;Raukvin&quot;), since the first church was built there. The first element is &quot;raukr&quot; which means &quot;pile, stack; mountain&quot; and the last element is &quot;vin&quot; which means &quot;meadow&quot; or &quot;pasture&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 15 December 1967. The figure shows a yellow fire on a blue background. It was chosen as a semi-canting symbol to represent smoke (which cannot be depicted in heraldry). The background for the motif is a common misunderstanding of the name as &quot;røyken&quot; the definite form of &quot;røyk&quot; meaning &quot;smoke&quot;.

==Geography==
Røyken is located south of Lier and Asker, on the northern part of the Hurum peninsula north of Hurum municipality. It lies between Oslofjord and Drammensfjord. It is connected to the eastern side of the Oslofjord via Hurum municipality and the Oslofjord Tunnel. The tunnel is long and connects Hurumhalvøya to Akershus county.

The district includes large amounts of residential zones with beautiful sights of the sea. The administration is situated in the village of Midtbygda. The main population centers are the villages of Hyggen, Hallenskog, Midtbygda, Nærsnes, Røyken, Slemmestad, Spikkestad, and Åros. Many people live in the northern part of Bødalen and its vicinities, which is a continuous residential area that continues throughout Asker and Bærum to Oslo.

==Municipality Reform==
As part of the municipality reform process instigated by Minister of Local Government Jan Tore Sanner the municipalities of Asker, Hurum and Røyken evaluated if they should merge into a new common municipality during the first half of 2016. A tentative agreement was reached and on 16 June 2016 the Municipal Council of Røyken approved the merger with Asker and Hurum with 24 votes for and 3 against. The merger date was 1 January 2020 and the chosen name was Asker.

<text>Hurum was a municipality in Buskerud county, Norway. As of 1 January 2020 Hurum has merged with the municipalities of Røyken and Asker to form the new Asker Municipality located in the newly formed Viken county. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village Sætre. The municipality of Hurum was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The small village of Holmsbu was granted town status in 1847, but it did not become a municipality of its own. It lost its town status on 1 January 1964.

Hurum was once suggested as the location for the new national airport of Norway. The plan was, however, abandoned, due to fears of too much fog in Hurum, and the main airport is now situated at Gardermoen in Akershus.

==Etymology==
===Name===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Húðrimar&quot;. The meaning of the first element &quot;(Húð)&quot; is unknown and the last element is the plural form of &quot;rimi&quot; which means &quot;ridge&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 2 February 1979. The arms show two blue wavy lines on a silver background. This was chosen because the municipality is on a peninsula between two fjords: Oslofjord and Drammensfjord. At the same time the arms are based on the arms of the Huitfeldt family, who played a major role in the local history. The family used a single bend as arms.

== History ==
Hurum was the site of the Hurum air disaster on 20 November 1949.

==Geography==
The municipality borders Røyken to the north. To the west the coastline is located close to the eastern coast of Vestfold with Svelvik. It is connected to the eastern side of the Oslofjord via Oslofjordtunnel, one of the longest undersea tunnels of its kind in Northern Europe. The tunnel is long and connects Hurumhalvøya to Akershus county.

Hurum is located on the southern part of Hurumhalvøya, which is the peninsula between the Oslofjord and Drammensfjord. The administrative centre is the village of Sætre, which together with Tofte are one of the two most populated villages in Hurum.

==Churches in Hurum==
* Filtvet Church
*Holmsbu Church
*Kongsdelene Church
*Hurum Church

==Hurum Church==

Hurum Church (&quot;Hurum kirke&quot;) is the parish church for Hurum. This is a medieval era church dating from ca. 1150. The edifice is constructed of stone and has 150 seats. The original church was ravaged by fire the night after Christmas Day 1686. The following year the church received a new roof and turret. In 1849 the church was extensively rebuilt. The interior has undergone a number of changes in the course of time. The cemetery is surrounded by stone wall and has a chapel from 1938. Naval hero and native son, Ivar Huitfeldt (1665-1710) was buried in the church yard. The pulpit was received as a gift from his wife, Kirsten Røyem Huitfeldt (1671–1750).

==Merging and dissolution==
On 9 May 2016, a referendum on the status of the municipality was held, with a majority of voters voting to merge Hurum with Røyken and Asker to create a new and larger Asker. Subsequently, on 21 June the same year, a majority of municipal councillors voted in favor of applying for the merger, which was subsequently accepted by the local councils of both Røyken and Asker. It was determined that the municipalities would officially merge on 1 January 2020. During the 2019 Norwegian local elections, voters in the three municipalities voted on who they wanted to govern the new municipality rather than their three original municipalities, the newly elected councillors took their seats on the same day as the municipalities merged.

<doc id="178165" wikidata="Q3189025" url="?curid=178165" title="Jeanne Julia Bartet">
<text>Julia Bartet was the stage name of Jeanne-Julie Regnault (28 October 1854 – 18 November 1941), a French actress. After training at the Paris Conservatoire she began her professional career in 1872, and from 1880 to her retirement in 1920 she was a leading member of the Comédie-Française. Her range was wide, and she appeared in classic plays and modern drama, in comedy and tragedy.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Bartet was born Jeanne-Julie Regnault on 20 October 1854 in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.
She studied at the Paris Conservatoire under the prominent actor and teacher François-Joseph Regnier. She won the conservatoire&#x27;s second prize for comedy in 1872 and made her first professional stage appearance in October of that year, adopting the stage name Bartet to avoid confusion with the established star actress Alice Regnault. Her first role was Vivette in the first production of Daudet &#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Arlesienne&quot; at the Théâtre du Vaudeville, Paris.

During the 1870s her other roles included Marguerite in Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Les Ganaches&quot; (1874); Manon in &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; (1875); Fanny Merson in Émile Augier&#x27;s &quot;Madame Caverlet&quot; (1876); Comtesse Zicka in &quot;Dora&quot; (1877) and leading parts in &quot;Les Bourgeois de Pont-Arcy&quot; (1878); &quot;Montjoye&quot; (1879) and &quot;Les Tapageurs&quot; (1879).
Her portrait was painted by Aimé Morot in 1881 and is at the Musée Carnavalet in Paris.

===Comédie-Française===
In 1879 Bartet was engaged by the Comédie-Française, where she made her début on 16 February 1880, as Léa in Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Daniel Rochat&quot;; later in that year she took over from Sarah Bernhardt as the Queen in &quot;Ruy Blas&quot;. On 24 December 1880 she was appointed as a sociétaire. Over the next forty years she played ninety roles at the Comédie-Française, ranging from comedy to tragedy, gaining the nickname &quot;La Divine&quot;. In her entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Theatre&quot; she listed more than forty plays that she considered particular successes, including &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot;, &quot;Andromaque&quot;, &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Bérénice&quot;, &quot;Hernani&quot;, &quot;Iphigénie&quot;, &quot;Le Roi s&#x27;amuse&quot; and &quot;Les Femmes savantes&quot;.

&quot;Le Figaro&quot; said that Bartet served the Comédie-Française with incomparable nobility, and commented that her &quot;scholarly and understated elegance … her refined grace, her restrained and profound pathos&quot; were &quot;one of the models of the French woman&quot;. Her retirement from the stage in 1920 was international news. In London &quot;The Times&quot; called it a loss that all French people would feel; &quot;The New York Herald&quot; praised Bartet&#x27;s generosity in stepping down to make way for younger members of the Comédie-Française, but asked, &quot;Who among the younger actressess is capable of filling Mme. Bartet&#x27;s place?&quot; On her retirement she was made an Officier of the Legion of Honour.

Bartet died at her home in the 8th arrondissement of Paris on 18 November 1941, at the age of 87 and was interred in the Passy Cemetery.

<doc id="178166" wikidata="Q653677" url="?curid=178166" title="Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg">
<text>Ernst Wilhelm Theodor Herrmann Hengstenberg (20 October 1802 in Fröndenberg – 28 May 1869 in Berlin), was a German Lutheran churchman and neo-Lutheran theologian from an old and important Dortmund family.

He was born at Fröndenberg, a Westphalian town, and was educated by his father Johann Heinrich Karl Hengstenberg, who was a famous minister of the Reformed Church and head of the Fröndenberg convent of canonesses (Fräuleinstift). His mother was Wilhelmine then Bergh. Entering the University of Bonn in 1819, Hengstenberg attended the lectures of Georg Wilhelm Freytag for Oriental languages and of Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler for church history, but his energies were principally devoted to philosophy and philology, and his earliest publication was an edition of the Arabic &quot;Mu&#x27;allaqat&quot; of Imru&#x27; al-Qais, which gained for him a prize at his graduation in the philosophical faculty. This was followed in 1824 by a German translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysics&quot;.

Finding himself without the means to complete his theological studies under Johann August Wilhelm Neander and Friedrich August Tholuck in Berlin, he accepted a post at Basel as tutor in Oriental languages to Johann Jakob Stähelin (1797–1875), later a professor at the university. It was there that he began to direct his attention to a study of the Bible, which led him to a conviction, not only of the divine character of evangelical religion, but also of the unapproachable adequacy of its expression in the Augsburg Confession. In 1824 he joined the philosophical faculty of the University of Berlin as a &quot;privatdozent&quot;, and in 1825 he became a licentiate in theology, his theses being remarkable for their evangelical fervour and for their emphatic protest against every form of &quot;rationalism&quot;, especially in questions of Old Testament criticism.

In 1826 he became professor extraordinarius in theology; and in July 1827 took on the editorship of the &quot;Evangelische Kirchenzeitung&quot;, a strictly orthodox journal, which in his hands acquired an almost unique reputation as a controversial organ. It did not become well known until in 1830 an anonymous article (by Ernst Ludwig von Gerlach) appeared, which openly charged Wilhelm Gesenius and Julius Wegscheider with infidelity and profanity, and on the ground of these accusations advocated the interposition of the civil power, thus giving rise to the prolonged &quot;Hallischer Streit&quot;. In 1828 the first volume of Hengstenberg&#x27;s &quot;Christologie des Alten Testaments&quot; passed through the press; in the autumn of that year he became professor ordinarius in theology, and in 1829 doctor of theology.

==Main works==

*&quot;Christologie des Alten Testaments&quot; (1829–1835; 2nd ed., 1854–1857; Eng. trans. by R Keith, 1835–1839, also in Clark&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Theological Library&quot;, by T Meyer and J Martin, 1854–1858), a work of much learning the estimate of which varies according to the hermeneutical principle of the individual critic.

Rollag is bordered in the north by Nore og Uvdal, in the east by Sigdal, in the south by Flesberg, and in the west by Tinn in Telemark.

==General information==
===History===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Rollag&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Roll(u)lag&quot;), since the first church was built here. The first element is probably (the genitive case of) a river name &quot;Rolla&quot; (now called the &quot;Troelva&quot; river) and the last element is &quot;lag&quot; which means &quot;fishing place&quot;.

The municipality of Rollag was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). Nore og Uvdal was separated from Rollag in 1858.

<doc id="178169" wikidata="Q60141" url="?curid=178169" title="Heinrich Barth">
<text>Johann Heinrich Barth (; ; 16 February 1821 – 25 November 1865) was a German explorer of Africa and scholar.

Barth is thought to be one of the greatest of the European explorers of Africa, as his scholarly preparation, ability to speak and write Arabic, learning African languages, and character meant that he carefully documented the details of the cultures he visited. He was among the first to comprehend the uses of oral history of peoples, and collected many. He established friendships with African rulers and scholars during his five years of travel (1850–1855). After the deaths of two European companions, he completed his travels with the aid of Africans. Afterwards, he wrote and published a five-volume account of his travels in both English and German. It has been invaluable for scholars of his time and since.

==Early life and education==
Heinrich Barth was born in Hamburg on 16 February 1821. He was the third child of Johann Christoph Heinrich Barth and his wife Charlotte Karoline &quot;née&quot; Zadow. Johann had come from a relatively poor background but had built up a successful trading business. Both parents were orthodox Lutherans and they expected their children to conform to their strict ideas on morality and self-discipline. From the age of eleven Barth attended the prestigious high school, the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums, in Hamburg. He was very studious but not popular with his classmates. He excelled at languages and taught himself some Arabic. Barth left school aged 18 in 1839 and immediately enrolled at the University of Berlin where he attended courses offered by the geographer Karl Ritter, the classical scholar August Böckh and the historian Jakob Grimm. After his first year, he interrupted his studies and went on a tour of Italy visiting Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Sicily, returning to Germany in the middle of May 1841. In the vacation of the following year, he visited the Rhineland and Switzerland. He defended his doctoral thesis on the trade relations of ancient Corinth in July 1844.

==Visit to North Africa and the Near East==
Barth formed a plan to undertake a grand tour of north Africa and the Middle East which his father agreed to fund. He left his parents&#x27; home at the end of January 1845 and first visited London where he spent two months learning Arabic, visiting the British Museum and securing the protection of the British consuls for his trip. While in London, he met the Prussian ambassador to Britain, Christian von Bunsen, who would later play an important role in his trip to central Africa. He left London and travelled across France and Spain. On 7 August he caught a ferry from Gibraltar to Tangiers for his first visit to Africa. From Tangier, he made his way overland across North Africa. He also travelled through Egypt, ascending the Nile to Wadi Halfa and crossing the desert to the port of Berenice on the Red Sea. While in Egypt, he was attacked and wounded by robbers. Crossing the Sinai peninsula, he traversed Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor, Turkey and Greece, everywhere examining the remains of antiquity. He returned to his parents&#x27; home in Hamburg on 27 December 1847 after a trip of almost three years. For a time he was engaged there as &quot;Privatdozent.&quot; He described some of his travels in the first volume of his book, &quot;Wanderungen durch die Küstenländer des Mittelmeeres&quot;, (&quot;Walks through the coastal states of the Mediterranean&quot;) which was published in 1849. The intended second volume never appeared.

==Expedition to the Sudan, the Sahara and Western Africa==


Christian Bunsen, the Prussian ambassador to Westminster, encouraged the appointment of scholars, including Barth and Adolf Overweg, a Prussian astronomer, to the expedition of James Richardson, an explorer of the Sahara. Richardson had been selected by the British government to open up commercial relations with the states of the central and western Sudan. The party left Marseille in late 1849, and departed from Tripoli early in 1850. They crossed the Sahara Desert with great difficulty. He arrived in the city of Agadez in October 1850 where he stayed for several days. Today a memorial tablet honours him as the first European to have ever entered the city.

The deaths of Richardson (March 1851) and Overweg (September 1852), who died of unknown diseases, left Barth to carry on the scientific mission alone. Barth was the first European to visit Adamawa in 1851. When he returned to Tripoli in September 1855, his journey had extended over 24° of latitude and 20° of longitude, from Tripoli in the north to Adamawa and Cameroon in the south, and from Lake Chad and Bagirmi in the east to Timbuktu (September 1853) in the west – upward of . He studied minutely the topography, history, civilizations, languages, and resources of the countries he visited. His success as an explorer and historian of Africa was based both on his patient character and his scholarly education.

Barth was interested in the history and culture of the African peoples, rather than the possibilities of commercial exploitation. Due to his level of documentation, his journal has become an invaluable source for the study of 19th-century Sudanic Africa. Although Barth was not the first European visitor who paid attention to the local oral traditions, he was the first who seriously considered its methodology and use for historical research. Barth was the first true European scholar to travel and study in West Africa. Earlier explorers such as René Caillié, Dixon Denham and Hugh Clapperton had no academic knowledge.

Barth was fluent in Arabic and several African languages (Fulani, Hausa and Kanuri) and was able to investigate the history of some regions, particularly the Songhay Empire. He established close relations with a number of African scholars and rulers, from Umar I ibn Muhammad al-Amin in Bornu, through the Katsina and Sokoto regions to Timbuktu. There his friendship with Ahmad al-Bakkai al-Kunti led to his staying in his house; he also received protection from al-Kunti against an attempt to seize him.
After his return to London Barth wrote and published accounts of his travels simultaneously in English and German, under the title &quot;Reisen und Entdeckungen in Nord- und Centralafrika&quot; (Travels and Discoveries in North and Central Africa; 1857–1858, 5 volumes., approx. 3,500 pages). The volumes included coloured plates of pictures produced by Martin Bernatz based on Barth&#x27;s original sketches. The work was considered one of the finest of its kind, being cited by Darwin. It is still used by historians of Africa, and remains an important scientific work on African cultures of the age. It also provided the first evidence by a European that the Sahara had once been a savanna.

==Later life==

Barth returned from Great Britain to Germany, where he prepared a collection of Central African vocabularies (Gotha, 1862–1866). In 1858 he undertook another journey in Asia Minor, and in 1862 visited the Turkish provinces in Europe. He wrote an account of these travels that was published in Berlin in 1864.

In the following year he was granted a professorship of geography (without chair or regular pay) at Berlin University and appointed president of the Geographical Society. His admission to the Prussian Academy of Sciences was denied, as it was claimed that he had achieved nothing for historiography and linguistics. They did not fully understand his achievements, which have been ratified by scholars over time.

Barth died in Berlin on 25 November 1865 aged 44. His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof III der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. III of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.

<text>Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler, KH (3 March 1792 – 8 July 1854) was a Protestant German church historian.

==Biography==
He was born at Petershagen, near Minden, where his father, Georg Christof Friedrich, was preacher. In his tenth year he entered the orphanage at Halle, from which he duly passed to the university, his studies being interrupted in October 1813 by a period of military service, during which he was enrolled as a volunteer in a regiment of chasseurs. On the conclusion of peace (1815) he returned to Halle, and, having in 1817 taken his degree in philosophy, he became assistant head (Conrector) of the Minden gymnasium, and in 1818 was appointed director of the gymnasium at Cleves.

Here he published his earliest work (&quot;Historisch-kritischer Versuch über die Entstehung u. die frühesten Schicksale der schriftlichen Evangelien&quot;), a treatise which had considerable influence on subsequent investigations as to the origin of the gospels. In 1819 Gieseler was appointed a professor ordinarius in theology in the newly founded University of Bonn, where, besides lecturing on church history, he made important contributions to the literature of that subject in Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenmüller&#x27;s &quot;Repertorium&quot;, KF Stäudlin and HG Tschirner&#x27;s &quot;Archiv&quot;, and in various university &quot;programs.&quot;

The first part of the first volume of his well-known &quot;Church History&quot; appeared in 1824. In 1831 he accepted a call to Göttingen as successor to GJ Planck. He lectured on church history, the history of dogma, and dogmatic theology. In 1837 he was appointed a &quot;Consistorialrath&quot;, and shortly afterwards was created a knight of the Royal Guelphic Order. The fifth volume of the &quot;Kirchengeschichte&quot;, embracing the period subsequent to 1814, and &quot;Dogmengeschichte&quot;, sometimes regarded as a sixth volume of the &quot;Church History&quot;, were published posthumously in 1855 by ER Redepenning (1810–1883), followed finally by the fourth in 1857. Less vivid and picturesque in style than Karl Hase, lacking August Neander&#x27;s deep and sympathetic insight into the more spiritual forces by which church life is pervaded, he excels these and all other contemporaries in the fulness and accuracy of his information. His &quot;Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte&quot;, with its copious references to original authorities, is of great value to the student: &quot;Gieseler wished that each age should speak for itself, since only by this means can the peculiarity of its ideas be fully appreciated.&quot; (Otto Pfleiderer, &quot;Development of Theology&quot;, p. 284).

<text>Gottlieb Jakob Planck (15 November 1751 – 31 August 1833) was a German theologian and church historian. He was the great-grandfather of physicist Max Planck.

==Biography==
Planck was born at Nürtingen in Württemberg, where his father was a notary. Educated for the Protestant ministry at Blaubeuren, Bebenhausen and Tübingen, he became a lecturer at Tübingen in 1774, a preacher at Stuttgart in 1780, and a professor of church history at the University of Göttingen in 1784.

At Tübingen he wrote &quot;Das Tagebuch eines neuen Ehemannes&quot;. In 1781 he published the first volume of &quot;Geschichte des protestantischen Lehrbegriffs&quot; (History of the Protestant teaching concept); the second volume appeared in 1783, and it was eventually completed in six volumes in 1800. It was followed by an extensive &quot;Geschichte der christlich-kirchlichen Gesellschaftsverfassung&quot; (History of the Christian church&#x27;s social constitution) in five volumes (1803–1809).

He died in Göttingen on 31 August 1833. His son Heinrich Ludwig Planck (1785–1831), also professor of theology at Göttingen, published &quot;Bemerkungen über den ersten Paulinischen brief an den Timotheus&quot; (1808) and &quot;Abriss der philosophischen Religionslehre&quot; (1821).

<text>George Henry Thomas (July 31, 1816March 28, 1870) was an American general in the Union Army during the American Civil War and one of the principal commanders in the Western Theater.

Thomas served in the Mexican–American War, and despite being a Virginian whose home state would join the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, he was a Southern Unionist who chose to remain in the U.S. Army. Thomas won one of the first Union victories in the war, at Mill Springs in Kentucky, and served in important subordinate commands at Perryville and Stones River. His stout defense at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863 saved the Union Army from being completely routed, earning him his most famous nickname, &quot;the Rock of Chickamauga.&quot; He followed soon after with a dramatic breakthrough on Missionary Ridge in the Battle of Chattanooga. In the Franklin–Nashville Campaign of 1864, he achieved one of the most decisive victories of the war, destroying the army of Confederate General John Bell Hood, his former student at West Point, at the Battle of Nashville.

Thomas had a successful record in the Civil War, but he failed to achieve the historical acclaim of some of his contemporaries, such as Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman. He developed a reputation as a slow, deliberate general. In an environment rife with jealousy and avarice for promotion and recognition, Thomas stood out as an oddball for occasionally refusing promotions to positions he thought he was still incapable of fulfilling. Conversely, he sometimes regretted his refusals or found it offensive that he was passed over for promotion. After the war, he did not write memoirs to advance his legacy and died only five years after the war ended.

==Early life and education==
Thomas was born at Newsom&#x27;s Depot, Southampton County, Virginia, five miles (8 km) from the North Carolina border. His father, John Thomas, of Welsh descent, and his mother, Elizabeth Rochelle Thomas, a descendant of French Huguenot immigrants, had six children. George had three sisters and two brothers. The family led an upper-class plantation lifestyle. By 1829, they owned and 15 slaves. John died in a farm accident when George was 13, leaving the family in financial difficulties. George Thomas, his sisters, and his widowed mother were forced to flee from their home and hide in the nearby woods during Nat Turner&#x27;s 1831 slave rebellion. Benson Bobrick has suggested that while some repressive acts were enforced following the crushing of the revolt, Thomas took the lesson another way, seeing that slavery was so vile an institution that it had forced the slaves to act in violence. This was a major event in the formation of his views on slavery; that the idea of the contented slave in the care of a benevolent overlord was a sentimental myth. Christopher Einolf, in contrast wrote &quot;For George Thomas, the view that slavery was needed as a way of controlling blacks was supported by his personal experience of Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion. ... Thomas left no written record of his opinion on slavery, but the fact that he owned slaves during much of his life indicates that he was not opposed to it.&quot; A traditional story is that Thomas taught as many as 15 of his family&#x27;s slaves to read, violating a Virginia law that prohibited this, and despite the wishes of his father.

Thomas was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1836 by Congressman John Y. Mason, who warned Thomas that no nominee from his district had ever graduated successfully. Entering at age 20, Thomas was known to his fellow cadets as &quot;Old Tom,&quot; and he became instant friends with his roommates, William T. Sherman and Stewart Van Vliet. He made steady academic progress, was appointed a cadet officer in his second year, and graduated 12th in a class of 42 in 1840. He was appointed a second lieutenant in Company D, 3rd U.S. Artillery.

==Antebellum military career==
Thomas&#x27;s first assignment with his artillery regiment began in late 1840 at the primitive outpost of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in the Seminole Wars, where his troops performed infantry duty. He led them in successful patrols and was appointed a brevet first lieutenant on November 6, 1841. From 1842 until 1845, he served in posts at New Orleans, Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, and Fort McHenry in Baltimore. With the Mexican–American War looming, his regiment was ordered to Texas in June 1845.

In Mexico, Thomas led a gun crew with distinction at the battles of Fort Brown, Resaca de la Palma, Monterrey, and Buena Vista, receiving two more brevet promotions. At Buena Vista, Gen. Zachary Taylor reported that &quot;the services of the light artillery, always conspicuous, were more than unusually distinguished&quot; during the battle. Brig. Gen. John E. Wool wrote about Thomas and another officer that &quot;without our artillery we would not have maintained our position a single hour.&quot; Thomas&#x27;s battery commander wrote that Thomas&#x27;s &quot;coolness and firmness contributed not a little to the success of the day. Lieutenant Thomas more than sustained the reputation he has long enjoyed in his regiment as an accurate and scientific artillerist.&quot; During the war, Thomas served closely with an artillery officer who would be a principal antagonist in the Civil War—Captain Braxton Bragg.

Thomas was reassigned to Florida in 1849–50. In 1851, he returned to West Point as a cavalry and artillery instructor, where he established a close professional and personal relationship with another Virginia officer, Lt. Col. Robert E. Lee, the Academy superintendent. His appointment there was based in part on a recommendation from Braxton Bragg. Concerned about the poor condition of the Academy&#x27;s elderly horses, Thomas moderated the tendency of cadets to overwork them during cavalry drills and became known as &quot;Slow Trot Thomas&quot;. Two of Thomas&#x27;s students who received his recommendation for assignment to the cavalry, J.E.B. Stuart and Fitzhugh Lee, became prominent Confederate cavalry generals. Another Civil War connection was a cadet expelled for disciplinary reasons on Thomas&#x27;s recommendation, John Schofield, who would excoriate Thomas in postbellum writings about his service as a corps commander under Thomas in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. On November 17, 1852, Thomas married Frances Lucretia Kellogg, age 31, from Troy, New York. The couple remained at West Point until 1854. Thomas was promoted to captain on December 24, 1853.

In the spring of 1854, Thomas&#x27;s artillery regiment was transferred to California and he led two companies to San Francisco via the Isthmus of Panama, and then on a grueling overland march to Fort Yuma. On May 12, 1855, Thomas was appointed a major of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry (later re-designated the 5th U.S. Cavalry) by Jefferson Davis, then Secretary of War. Once again, Braxton Bragg had provided a recommendation for Thomas&#x27;s advancement. There was a suspicion as the Civil War drew closer that Davis had been assembling and training a combat unit of elite U.S. Army officers who harbored Southern sympathies, and Thomas&#x27;s appointment to this regiment implied that his colleagues assumed he would support his native state of Virginia in a future conflict. Thomas resumed his close ties with the second-in-command of the regiment, Robert E. Lee, and the two officers traveled extensively together on detached service for court-martial duty. In October 1857, Major Thomas assumed acting command of the cavalry regiment, an assignment he would retain for 2½ years. On August 26, 1860, during a clash with a Comanche warrior, Thomas was wounded by an arrow passing through the flesh near his chin area and sticking into his chest at Clear Fork, Brazos River, Texas. Thomas pulled the arrow out and, after a surgeon dressed the wound, continued to lead the expedition. This was the only combat wound that Thomas suffered throughout his long military career.

In November 1860, Thomas requested a one-year leave of absence. His antebellum career had been distinguished and productive, and he was one of the rare officers with field experience in all three combat arms—infantry, cavalry, and artillery. On his way home to southern Virginia, he suffered a mishap in Lynchburg, Virginia, falling from a train platform and severely injuring his back. This accident led him to contemplate leaving military service and caused him pain for the rest of his life. Continuing to New York to visit with his wife&#x27;s family, Thomas stopped in Washington, D.C., and conferred with general-in-chief Winfield Scott, advising Scott that Maj. Gen. David E. Twiggs, the commander of the Department of Texas, harbored secessionist sympathies and could not be trusted in his post. Twiggs did indeed surrender his entire command to Confederate authorities shortly after Texas seceded, and later served in the Confederate military.

==American Civil War==
===Remaining with the Union===
At the outbreak of the Civil War, 19 of the 36 officers in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry resigned, including three of Thomas&#x27;s superiors—Albert Sidney Johnston, Robert E. Lee, and William J. Hardee. Many Southern-born officers were torn between loyalty to their states and loyalty to their country. Thomas struggled with the decision but opted to remain with the United States. His Northern-born wife probably helped influence his decision. In response, his family turned his picture against the wall, destroyed his letters, and never spoke to him again. During the economic hard times in the South after the war, Thomas sent some money to his sisters, who angrily refused to accept it, declaring they had no brother.

Nevertheless, Thomas stayed in the Union Army with some degree of suspicion surrounding him, despite his action concerning Twiggs. On January 18, 1861, a few months before Fort Sumter, he had applied for a job as the commandant of cadets at the Virginia Military Institute. Any real tendency to the secessionist cause, however, could be refuted when he turned down Virginia Governor John Letcher&#x27;s offer to become chief of for the Virginia Provisional Army. On June 18, his former student and fellow Virginian, Confederate Col. J.E.B. Stuart, wrote to his wife, &quot;Old George H. Thomas is in command of the cavalry of the enemy. I would like to hang, &quot;hang&quot; him as a traitor to his native state.&quot;
Nevertheless, as the Civil War carried on, he won the affection of Union soldiers serving under him as a &quot;soldier&#x27;s soldier&quot;, who took to affectionately referring to Thomas as &quot;Pap Thomas&quot;.

===Kentucky===
Thomas was promoted in rapid succession to be lieutenant colonel (on April 25, 1861, replacing Robert E. Lee) and colonel (May 3, replacing Albert Sidney Johnston) in the regular army, and brigadier general of volunteers (August 17). In the First Bull Run Campaign, he commanded a brigade under Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson in the Shenandoah Valley, but all of his subsequent assignments were in the Western Theater. Reporting to Maj. Gen. Robert Anderson in Kentucky, Thomas was assigned to training recruits and to command an independent force in the eastern half of the state. On January 18, 1862, he defeated Confederate Brig. Gens. George B. Crittenden and Felix Zollicoffer at Mill Springs, gaining the first important Union victory in the war, breaking Confederate strength in eastern Kentucky, and lifting Union morale.

===Shiloh and Corinth===
On December 2, 1861, Brig. Gen. Thomas was assigned to command the 1st Division of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio. He missed the Battle of Shiloh (April 7, 1862), arriving after the fighting had ceased. The victor at Shiloh, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, came under severe criticism for the bloody battle due to the surprise and lack of preparations and his superior, Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, reorganized his Department of the Mississippi to ease Grant out of direct field command. The three armies in the department were divided and recombined into three &quot;wings&quot;. Thomas, promoted to major general effective April 25, 1862, was given command of the Right Wing, consisting of four divisions from Grant&#x27;s former Army of the Tennessee and one from the Army of the Ohio. Thomas successfully led this force in the siege of Corinth. On June 10, Grant returned to command of the original Army of the Tennessee.

===Perryville, Stones River, Chickamauga, and Chattanooga===

Thomas resumed service under Don Carlos Buell. During Confederate General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s invasion of Kentucky in the fall of 1862, the Union high command became nervous about Buell&#x27;s cautious tendencies and offered command of the Army of the Ohio to Thomas, who refused, as Buell&#x27;s plans were too far advanced. Thomas served as Buell&#x27;s second-in-command at the Battle of Perryville, but his wing of the army did not hear the fighting engaged in by the other flank. Although tactically inconclusive, the battle halted Bragg&#x27;s invasion of Kentucky as he voluntarily withdrew to Tennessee. Again frustrated with Buell&#x27;s ineffective pursuit of Bragg, the government replaced him with Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans. Thomas wrote on October 30, 1862, a letter of protest to Secretary Stanton, because Rosecrans had been junior to him, but Stanton wrote back on November 15, telling him that this was not the case (Rosecrans had in fact been his junior, but his commission as major general had been backdated to make him senior to Thomas) and reminding him of his earlier refusal to accept command; Thomas demurred and withdrew his protest.
Fighting under Rosecrans, commanding the &quot;Center&quot; wing of the newly renamed Army of the Cumberland, Thomas gave an impressive performance at the Battle of Stones River, holding the center of the retreating Union line and once again preventing a victory by Bragg. He was in charge of the most important part of the maneuvering from Decherd to Chattanooga during the Tullahoma Campaign (June 22 – July 3, 1863) and the crossing of the Tennessee River. At the Battle of Chickamauga on September 19, 1863, now commanding the XIV Corps, he once again held a desperate position against Bragg&#x27;s onslaught while the Union line on his right collapsed. Thomas rallied broken and scattered units together on Horseshoe Ridge to prevent a significant Union defeat from becoming a hopeless rout. Future president James Garfield, a field officer for the Army of the Cumberland, visited Thomas during the battle, carrying orders from Rosecrans to retreat; when Thomas said he would have to stay behind to ensure the Army&#x27;s safety, Garfield told Rosecrans that Thomas was &quot;standing like a rock.&quot; After the battle he became widely known by the nickname &quot;The Rock of Chickamauga&quot;, representing his determination to hold a vital position against strong odds.
Thomas succeeded Rosecrans in command of the Army of the Cumberland shortly before the Battles for Chattanooga (November 23–25, 1863), a stunning Union victory that was highlighted by Thomas&#x27;s troops taking Lookout Mountain on the right and then storming the Confederate line on Missionary Ridge, the next day. When the Army of the Cumberland advanced further than ordered, General Grant, on Orchard Knob asked Thomas, &quot;Who ordered the advance?&quot; Thomas replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I did not.&quot;

===Atlanta and Franklin/Nashville===
During Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s advance through Georgia in the spring of 1864, the Army of the Cumberland numbered over 60,000 men, and Thomas&#x27;s staff did the logistics and engineering for Sherman&#x27;s entire army group, including developing a novel series of Cumberland pontoons. At the Battle of Peachtree Creek (July 20, 1864), Thomas&#x27;s defense severely damaged Lt. Gen. John B. Hood&#x27;s army in its first attempt to break the siege of Atlanta.

When Hood broke away from Atlanta in the autumn of 1864, menaced Sherman&#x27;s long line of communications, and endeavored to force Sherman to follow him, Sherman abandoned his communications and embarked on the March to the Sea. Thomas stayed behind to fight Hood in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Thomas, with a smaller force, raced with Hood to reach Nashville, where he was to receive reinforcements.

At the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864, a large part of Thomas&#x27;s force, under command of Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield, dealt Hood a strong defeat and held him in check long enough to cover the concentration of Union forces in Nashville. At Nashville, Thomas had to organize his forces, which had been drawn from all parts of the West and which included many raw troops and even quartermaster employees. He declined to attack until his army was ready and the ice covering the ground had melted enough for his men to move. General Grant (now general-in-chief of all Union armies) grew impatient at the delay. Grant sent Maj. Gen. John A. Logan with an order to replace Thomas, and soon afterwards Grant started a journey west from City Point, Virginia to take command in person.

Thomas attacked on December 15, 1864, and the Battle of Nashville effectively destroyed Hood&#x27;s army in two days of fighting. Thomas sent his wife, Frances Lucretia Kellogg Thomas, the following telegram, the only communication surviving of the Thomases&#x27; correspondence: &quot;We have whipped the enemy, taken many prisoners and considerable artillery.&quot;

Thomas was appointed a major general in the regular army, with date of rank of his Nashville victory, and received the Thanks of Congress:

Thomas may have resented his delayed promotion to major general (which made him junior by date of rank to Sheridan); upon receiving the telegram announcing it, he remarked to Surgeon George Cooper: &quot;I suppose it is better late than never, but it is too late to be appreciated. I earned this at Chickamauga.&quot;.

Thomas also received another nickname from his victory: &quot;The Sledge of Nashville&quot;.

==Later life and death==

After the end of the Civil War, Thomas commanded the Department of the Cumberland in Kentucky and Tennessee, and at times also West Virginia and parts of Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama, through 1869. During the Reconstruction period, Thomas acted to protect freedmen from white abuses. He set up military commissions to enforce labor contracts since the local courts had either ceased to operate or were biased against blacks. Thomas also used troops to protect places threatened by violence from the Ku Klux Klan. In a November 1868 report, Thomas noted efforts made by former Confederates to paint the Confederacy in a positive light, stating:
President Andrew Johnson offered Thomas the rank of lieutenant general—with the intent to eventually replace Grant, a Republican and future president, with Thomas as general in chief—but the ever-loyal Thomas asked the Senate to withdraw his name for that nomination because he did not want to be party to politics. In 1869 he requested assignment to command the Military Division of the Pacific with headquarters at the Presidio of San Francisco. He died there of a stroke on March 28, 1870, while writing an answer to an article criticizing his military career by his wartime rival John Schofield. Sherman, by then general-in-chief, personally conveyed the news to President Grant at the White House. None of Thomas&#x27;s blood relatives attended his funeral as they had never forgiven him for his loyalty to the Union. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, in Troy, New York. His gravestone was sculpted by Robert E. Launitz and comprises a white marble sarcophagus topped by a bald eagle.

==Legacy==
The veterans&#x27; organization for the Army of the Cumberland, throughout its existence, fought to see that he was honored for all he had done. In 1879, they commissioned the equestrian statue of Thomas at Thomas Circle, Washington, D.C.

Thomas was in chief command of only two battles in the Civil War, the Battle of Mill Springs at the beginning and the Battle of Nashville near the end. Both were decisive victories. However, his contributions at the battles of Stones River, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Peachtree Creek were decisive. His main legacies lay in his development of modern battlefield doctrine and in his mastery of logistics.

Thomas has generally been held in high esteem by Civil War historians; Bruce Catton and Carl Sandburg wrote glowingly of him, and many consider Thomas one of the top three Union generals of the war, after Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman. But Thomas never entered the popular consciousness like those men. The general destroyed his private papers, saying he did not want &quot;his life hawked in print for the eyes of the curious.&quot; Beginning in the 1870s, many Civil War generals published memoirs, justifying their decisions or re-fighting old battles, but Thomas, who died in 1870, did not publish his own memoirs. In addition, most of his campaigns were in the Western theater of the war, which received less attention both in the press of the day and in contemporary historical accounts.

Grant and Thomas also had a cool relationship, for reasons that are not entirely clear, but are well-attested by contemporaries. It apparently started when Halleck placed Thomas in command of most of Grant&#x27;s divisions after the Battle of Shiloh. When a rain-soaked Grant arrived at Thomas&#x27;s headquarters before the Chattanooga Campaign, Thomas, caught up in other activity, did not provide dry clothes for several minutes until Grant&#x27;s staffer intervened. Thomas&#x27;s perceived slowness at Nashville—although necessitated by the weather—drove Grant into a fit of impatience, and Grant nearly replaced Thomas. In his &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;, Grant minimized Thomas&#x27;s contributions, particularly during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, saying his movements were &quot;always so deliberate and so slow, though effective in defence.&quot;

Grant did, however, acknowledge that Thomas&#x27;s eventual success at Nashville obviated all criticism. Sherman, who had been close to Thomas throughout the war, also repeated the accusation after the war that Thomas was &quot;slow&quot;, and this damning with faint praise tended to affect perceptions of the Rock of Chickamauga up to the present day. Both Sherman and Grant attended Thomas&#x27;s funeral, and were reported by third parties to have been visibly moved by his passing. Thomas&#x27;s legendary bay horse, Billy, bore his friend Sherman&#x27;s name.

Thomas was always on good terms with his commanding officer in the Army of the Cumberland, William Rosecrans. Even after Rosecrans was relieved of command by Grant and replaced by Thomas, he had nothing but praise for him. Upon hearing of Thomas&#x27; death, Rosecrans sent a letter to the National Tribune, stating Thomas&#x27; passing was a &quot;National Calamity... Few knew him better than I did, none valued him more.&quot;

In 1887, Sherman published an article praising Grant and Thomas, and contrasting them to Robert E. Lee. After noting that Thomas, unlike his fellow Virginian Lee, stood by the Union, Sherman wrote:Sherman concluded that Grant and Thomas were &quot;heroes&quot; deserving &quot;monuments like those of Nelson and Wellington in London, well worthy to stand side by side with the one which now graces our city of &#x27;George Washington.&#x27;&quot;

==In memoriam==

A fort south of Newport, Kentucky was named in his honor, and the city of Fort Thomas now stands there and carries his name as well. A memorial honoring Thomas, &quot;Major General George Henry Thomas&quot;, can be found in the eponymous Thomas Circle in Washington, D.C.

A distinctive engraved portrait of Thomas appeared on U.S. paper money in 1890 and 1891. The bills are called &quot;treasury notes&quot; or &quot;coin notes&quot; and are widely collected today because of their fine, detailed engraving. The $5 Thomas &quot;fancyback&quot; note of 1890, with an estimated 450–600 in existence relative to the 7.2 million printed, ranks as number 90 in the &quot;100 Greatest American Currency Notes&quot; compiled by Bowers and Sundman (2006).

Thomas County, Kansas, established in 1888, is named in his honor. The townships of Thomas County are named after fallen soldiers in the Battle of Chickamauga. Thomas County, Nebraska, is also named after him.

In 1999 a statue of Thomas by sculptor Rudy Ayoroa was unveiled in Lebanon, Kentucky.

A bust of Thomas is located in Grant&#x27;s Tomb in Manhattan, New York.

Thomas&#x27;s torn loyalties during the Civil War are briefly discussed in Chapter XIX of MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955).

A three-quarter length portrait of him, executed by U.S. general Samuel Woodson Price (1828–1918) in 1869 and gifted by the heirs of General Price, hangs in the stairwell to Special Collections at Transylvania University, Lexington, Kentucky.

A Sons of Union Veterans Camp, Camp No. 19 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, is named in his honor.

He was honored as the namesake of the George Henry Thomas Post Number 5 of the Grand Army of the Republic. A 10-mile road in Southampton County, Virginia, his birthplace, is named General Thomas Highway.

<text>Karl August von Hase (25 August 1800 – 3 January 1890) was a German Protestant theologian and church historian.

== Background ==
He was born at Steinbach (near Penig) in Saxony. He studied at Leipzig and Erlangen, and in 1829 was called to Jena as professor of theology. He retired in 1883 and was made a baron. He was the great-grandfather of Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

Hase&#x27;s aim was to reconcile modern culture with historical Christianity in a scientific way. But though a liberal theologian, he was no dry rationalist. Indeed, he vigorously attacked rationalism, as distinguished from the rational principle, charging it with being unscientific inasmuch as it ignored the historical significance of Christianity, shut its eyes to individuality and failed to give religious feeling its due.

== Works ==

His views are presented scientifically in his &quot;Evangelisch-protestantische Dogmatik&quot; (1826; 6th edition, 1870), the value of which &quot;lies partly in the full and judiciously chosen historical materials prefixed to each dogma, and partly in the skill, caution and tact with which the permanent religious significance of various dogmas is discussed&quot; (Otto Pfleiderer). More popular in style is his &quot;Gnosis: Oder evangelische Glaubenslehre, für die gebildeten in der Gemeinde&quot;, (volume 1, 1827; volume 2, 1828; volume 3, 1829; second edition in two volumes, 1869 &amp; 1870). But his reputation rests chiefly on his treatment of church history in his &quot;Kirchengeschichte, Lehrbuch zunächst für akademische Vorlesungen&quot; (1834, 12th edition, 1900; English translation, 1870).

His biographical studies, &quot;Franz von Assisi&quot; (1856; second edition, 1892), &quot;Caterina von Siena&quot; (1864; second edition, 1892), &quot;Neue Propheten (Die Jungfrau von Orleans, Savonarola, Thomas Münzer)&quot; are judicious and sympathetic. Other works are: 
* &quot;Hutterus Redivivus, or, doctrine of the Evangelical Lutheran Church&quot; (1827; 12th edition, 1883), a work in which he sought to present the teaching of the Protestant church in such a way as Leonhard Hutter would have reconstructed it, had he still been alive. 
* &quot;Das Leben Jesu&quot; (1829; 5th edition, 1865; English translation, 1860); in an enlarged form, &quot;Geschichte Jesu&quot; (second edition, 1891). 
* &quot;Handbuch der protestantischen Polemik gegen die Römisch-katholische Kirche&quot; (1862; 7th edition, 1900; English translation, volume 1, volume 2, 1906).

For his life, see his &quot;Ideale und Irrtümer&quot; (1872; 5th edition, 1894) and &quot;Annalen meines Lebens&quot; (1891); and for comparison — Otto Pfleiderer, &quot;The development of theology in Germany since Kant&quot; (1890) and Frédéric Lichtenberger, &quot;History of German theology in the nineteenth century&quot; (1889).

<text>Soyuz (, GRAU index: 11A511) is a family of Soviet and later Russian expendable medium-lift launch vehicles initially developed by the OKB-1 design bureau and manufactured by the Progress Rocket Space Centre factory in Samara, Russia. It holds the record for the most launches in the history of spaceflight. Soyuz rockets are part of the R-7 rocket family, which evolved from the R-7 Semyorka, the world&#x27;s first intercontinental ballistic missile.

As with many Soviet rockets, the names of recurring payloads became associated with the launch vehicle itself. Consequently, the Soyuz rockets are best known as the launch vehicles for crewed Soyuz spacecraft under the Soyuz programme, as well as for uncrewed Progress cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS). Despite this recognition, the majority of Soyuz launches have been dedicated to deploying for satellites for both governmental and commercial purposes.

All variants of the Soyuz rocket use kerosene (RP-1) fuel and liquid oxygen (LOX), with the exception of the Soyuz-U2, which used Syntin (a variant of RP-1) with LOX.

From the final flight of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 until SpaceX&#x27;s first crewed mission in 2020, Soyuz rockets were the only approved launch vehicles for transporting astronauts to the ISS.

== History ==
=== Development ===
The Soyuz launcher was introduced in 1966, deriving from the Vostok launcher, which in turn was based on the 8K74 or R-7a intercontinental ballistic missile. It was initially a three-stage rocket with a Block I upper stage. The first four test launches were all failures, but eventually it worked. Later a Molniya variant was produced by adding a fourth stage, allowing it to reach the highly elliptical Molniya orbit. A later variant was the Soyuz-U. While the exact model and variant designations were kept secret from the west, the Soyuz launcher was referred to by either the United States Department of Defense designation of SL-4, or the Sheldon designation of A-2 (developed by Charles S. Sheldon, an analyst with the Library of Congress). Both systems for naming Soviet rockets stopped being used as more accurate information became available.

The production of Soyuz launchers reached a peak of 60 per year in the early 1980s. It has become the world&#x27;s most used space launcher, flying over 1700 times, far more than any other rocket. Despite its age and perhaps thanks to its simplicity, this rocket family has been notable for its low cost and high reliability.

=== Soyuz / Fregat ===

In the early 1990s plans were made for a redesigned Soyuz with a Fregat upper stage. The Fregat engine was developed by NPO Lavochkin from the propulsion module of its Phobos interplanetary probes. Although endorsed by the Roscosmos and the Russian Ministry of Defence in 1993 and designated &quot;Rus&quot; as a Russification and modernisation of Soyuz, and later renamed Soyuz-2, a funding shortage prevented implementation of the plan. The creation of Starsem in July 1996 provided new funding for the creation of a less ambitious variant, the Soyuz-Fregat or Soyuz-U/Fregat. This consisted of a slightly modified Soyuz-U combined with the Fregat upper stage, with a capacity of up to 1350 kg to geostationary transfer orbit. In April 1997, Starsem obtained a contract from the European Space Agency (ESA) to launch two pairs of Cluster II plasma science satellites using the Soyuz-Fregat. Before the introduction of this new model, Starsem launched 24 satellites of the Globalstar constellation in 6 launches with a restartable Ikar upper stage, between 22 September 1999 and 22 November 1999. After successful test flights of Soyuz-Fregat on 9 February 2000 and 20 March 2000, the Cluster II satellites were launched on 16 July 2000 and 9 August 2000. Another Soyuz-Fregat launched the ESA&#x27;s Mars Express probe from Baikonur in June 2003. Now the Soyuz-Fregat launcher is used by Starsem for commercial payloads.

=== ISS crew transport ===
Between 1 February 2003 and 26 July 2005 with the grounding of the United States Space Shuttle fleet, Soyuz was the only means of transportation to and from the International Space Station. This included the transfer of supplies, via Progress spacecraft, and crew changeovers. After the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States space program was without any means to take astronauts into orbit, and NASA was dependent on the Soyuz to send crew into space until 2020. NASA resumed crewed flights from the United States in 2020 through the Commercial Crew Development program.

=== Recent incidents ===
A long streak of successful Soyuz launches was broken on 15 October 2002 when the uncrewed Soyuz-U launch of the Photon-M satellite from Plesetsk fell back near the launch pad and exploded 29 seconds after lift-off. One person from the ground crew was killed and eight were injured.

Another failure occurred on 21 June 2005, during a Molniya military communications satellite launch from the Plesetsk launch site, which used a four-stage version of the rocket called Molniya-M. The flight ended six minutes after the launch because of a failure of the third stage engine or an unfulfilled order to separate the second and third stages. The rocket&#x27;s second and third stages, which are identical to the Soyuz, and its payload (a Molniya-3K satellite) crashed in the Uvatsky region of Tyumen (Siberia).

On 24 August 2011, an uncrewed Soyuz-U carrying cargo to the International Space Station crashed, failing to reach orbit. On December 23, 2011, a Soyuz-2.1b launching a Meridian 5 military communications satellite failed in the 7th minute of launch because of an anomaly in the third stage.

On 11 October 2018, the Soyuz MS-10 mission to the International Space Station failed to reach orbit after an issue with the main booster. The launch escape system was used to pull the Soyuz spacecraft away from the malfunctioning rocket. The two crew, Aleksey Ovchinin and Nick Hague, followed a ballistic trajectory and landed safely over 400 km downrange from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

=== Soyuz 2 ===


The venerable Soyuz launcher was gradually replaced by a new version, named Soyuz 2, which has a new digital guidance system and a highly modified third stage with a new engine. The first development version of Soyuz 2 called Soyuz 2.1a, which is equipped with the digital guidance system, but is still propelled by an old third stage engine, started on 4 November 2004 from Plesetsk on a suborbital test flight, followed by an orbital flight on 23 October 2006 from Baikonur. The fully modified launcher (version Soyuz 2.1b) flew first on 27 December 2006 with the CoRoT satellite from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

On 19 January 2005, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Roscosmos agreed to launch Soyuz ST rockets from the Guiana Space Centre. The equatorial launch site allows the Soyuz to deliver 2.7 to 4.9 tonnes into Sun-synchronous orbit, depending on the third-stage engine used. Construction of a new pad started in 2005 and was completed in April 2011. The pad used vertical loading common at French Guiana, unlike the horizontal loading used at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. A simulated launch was conducted in early May 2011. The first operational launch happened on 21 October 2011, bearing the first two satellites in Galileo global positioning system.

The Soyuz-U and Soyuz-FG rockets were gradually replaced by Soyuz 2 from 2014 until 2019. Soyuz-U was retired in 2017, while Soyuz-FG carried astronaut crews to the ISS until September 2019 (final flight, Soyuz MS-15, on 25 September 2019).

== Variants ==

* Soyuz (1966–1975)
* Soyuz-L (1970–1971)
* Soyuz-M (1971–1976)
* Soyuz-U (1973–2017)
** Soyuz-U2 (1982–1995)
* Soyuz-FG (2001–2019)
* Soyuz-2 (2006–present)
** Soyuz-ST (2011–2022)

The Molniya-M (1964–2010) was also derived from the Soyuz family.

== Assembly ==
The rocket is assembled horizontally in the Assembly and Testing Building. The assembled rocket is transported to the launch site in its horizontal state and then raised. This is different from the vertical assembly of, for example, the Saturn V, and is one of the features that makes Soyuz cheaper to prepare for launch. Assembling a horizontally positioned rocket is relatively simple as all modules are easily accessible. Assembling the rocket in vertical position would require a windproof high-rise hangar, which was not considered financially feasible at the time the rocket was designed, due to the failing economy of the Soviet Union.

== Prelaunch ==
The entire rocket is suspended in the launch system by the load-bearing mechanisms on the strap-on boosters where they are attached to the central core. The latter rests on the nose sections of the strap-on boosters. This scheme resembles flight conditions when the strap-on boosters push the central core forward. The concept of suspending the rocket was one of the novelties introduced with the R-7/Soyuz.

Since the launch pad has been eliminated, the bottom portion of the rocket is lowered. The launch system trusses bear the wind loads. Resistance to high wind is an important feature of the launch system, as the Kazakhstan steppes, where the Baikonur launch site is located, are known for windstorms.

== Launch ==
The engines are ignited by electrically initiated pyrotechnic flares, mounted on birch poles, which are ignited at approximately T-20 seconds, a few seconds before fuel components are introduced into the combustion chamber. This sequence rarely fails due to its simplicity. During launch, the support booms track the movement of the rocket. After the support boom heads emerge from the special support recess in the nose sections of the strapons, the support booms and trusses disconnect from the rocket airframe, swiveling on the support axes and freeing the way for the rocket to lift off. During launch, the rocket and the launch facility form a single dynamic system.

When the strap-on booster engines stop, the boosters fall away, providing nonimpact separation. If the skies are clear, ground observers can see a Korolev cross formed by the falling boosters.

== Fairings used for uncrewed missions ==
The Soyuz launch vehicle is used for various Russian uncrewed missions and is also marketed by Starsem for commercial satellite launches. Presently the following fairing types are used:

Progress is the cargo spacecraft for uncrewed missions to the ISS and previously to Mir. The spacecraft uses a dedicated platform and fairing and can be launched with either Soyuz-U, Soyuz-FG or Soyuz-2.

A-type fairing is used for commercial launches.

S-type fairing is used for commercial launches by Starsem. The fairing has external diameter of 3.7 m and a length of 7.7 m. The Fregat upper stage is encapsulated in the fairing with the payload and a payload adapter/dispenser. S-type fairing along with Fregat upper stage were used to launch the following spacecraft: Galaxy 14, GIOVE A, Mars Express, AMOS-2, Venus Express, Cluster.

SL-type fairing is used for commercial launches by Starsem. The fairing has external diameter of 3.7 m and a length of 8.45 m. The Fregat upper stage is encapsulated in the fairing with the payload and a payload adapter/dispenser. SL-type fairing along with Fregat upper stage were used to launch the following spacecraft: CoRoT.

ST-type fairing is used for commercial launches by Starsem. Its external diameter is 4.1 m and its length is 11.4 m. It can be used with the Soyuz-2 only, because older analog control system cannot cope with aerodynamic instability introduced by a fairing this large. This carbon-plastic fairing is based on the proven configuration used for Arianespace&#x27;s Ariane 4 vehicles, with its length increased by approximately one additional meter. The fairing has been developed and is being manufactured by TsSKB-Progress in accordance with the requirements of a customer (Starsem). This is the only fairing type offered by Starsem/Arianespace for launches from Kourou. Progress M-UM is the only Progress Spacecraft that was launched while being enclosed in a ST fairing.

== Stages ==
=== First stage ===
The first stage of Soyuz rockets consists of four identical conical liquid booster rockets strapped to the second stage core. These boosters are also called Blok-B, V, G, and D. Each engine has four main combustion chambers and two vernier thruster combustion chambers for attitude control. The engine is pump-fed by a hydrogen peroxide gas generator. Propellant tanks are pressurized using liquid nitrogen vaporization.

<doc id="178182" wikidata="Q579421" url="?curid=178182" title="Soyuz (spacecraft)">
<text>Soyuz () is a series of spacecraft which has been in service since the 1960s, having made more than 140 flights. It was designed for the Soviet space program by the Korolev Design Bureau (now Energia). The Soyuz succeeded the Voskhod spacecraft and was originally built as part of the Soviet crewed lunar programs. It is launched atop the similarly named Soyuz rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. 

Following the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution, Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, continued to develop and utilize the Soyuz. Between the Space Shuttle&#x27;s 2011 retirement and the SpaceX Crew Dragon&#x27;s 2020 debut, Soyuz was the sole means of crewed transportation to and from the International Space Station, a role it continues to fulfill. The Soyuz design has also influenced other spacecraft, including China&#x27;s Shenzhou and Russia&#x27;s Progress cargo vehicle. 

The Soyuz is a single-use spacecraft composed of three main sections. The descent module is where cosmonauts are seated for launch and reentry. The orbital module provides additional living space and storage during orbit but is jettisoned before reentry. The service module, responsible for propulsion and power, is also discarded prior to reentry. For added safety and aerodynamics, the spacecraft is encased within a fairing with a launch escape system during liftoff. 

== History ==
The first Soyuz mission, Kosmos 133, launched unmanned on 28 November 1966. The first crewed Soyuz mission, Soyuz 1, launched on 23 April 1967 but ended tragically on 24 April 1967 when the parachute failed to deploy on reentry, killing cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. The following flight, Soyuz 2 was uncrewed. Soyuz 3 launched on 26 October 1968 and became the program&#x27;s first successful crewed mission. The program suffered another fatal setback during Soyuz 11, where cabin depressurization during reentry killed the entire crew. These are the only humans to date who are known to have died above the Kármán line, the conventional definition of the edge of space.

Despite these early tragedies, Soyuz has earned a reputation as one of the safest and most cost-effective human spaceflight vehicles, a legacy built upon its unparalleled operational history. The spacecraft has served as the primary mode of transport for cosmonauts to and from the &quot;Salyut&quot; space stations, the &quot;Mir&quot; space station, and International Space Station (ISS).

== Design ==
Soyuz spacecraft are composed of three primary sections (from top to bottom, when standing on the launch pad):

* Orbital module: A spheroid compartment providing living space for the crew.
* Descent module: A small, aerodynamic capsule where the crew is seated for launch and return the crew to Earth.
* Service module: A cylindrical section housing propulsion, power, and other systems.

The orbital and service modules are discarded and destroyed upon reentry. This design choice, while seemingly wasteful, reduces the spacecraft&#x27;s weight by minimizing the amount of heat shielding required. As a result, Soyuz offers more habitable interior space () compared to its Apollo counterpart (). While the reentry module does return to Earth, it is not reusable, a new Soyuz spacecraft must be made for every mission. 

Soyuz can carry up to three crew members and provide life support for about 30 person-days. 

A payload fairing protects Soyuz during launch and is jettisoned early in flight. Equipped with an automated docking system, the spacecraft can operate autonomously or under manual control.

=== Launch escape system ===
The Vostok spacecraft used an ejector seat to bail out the cosmonaut in the event of a low-altitude launch failure, as well as during reentry; however, it would probably have been ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff, when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy. Inspired by the Mercury LES, Soviet designers began work on a similar system in 1962. This included developing a complex sensing system to monitor various launch-vehicle parameters and trigger an abort if a booster malfunction occurred. Based on data from R-7 launches over the years, engineers developed a list of the most likely failure modes for the vehicle and could narrow down abort conditions to premature separation of a strap-on booster, low engine thrust, loss of combustion-chamber pressure, or loss of booster guidance. The spacecraft abort system (SAS; ) could also be manually activated from the ground, but unlike American spacecraft, there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves.

Since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the Soyuz service module cleanly, the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort. Four folding stabilizers were added to improve aerodynamic stability during ascent. Two test runs of the SAS were carried out in 1966–1967.

The basic design of the SAS has remained almost unchanged in 50 years of use, and all Soyuz launches carry it. The only modification was in 1972, when the aerodynamic fairing over the SAS motor nozzles was removed for weight-saving reasons, as the redesigned Soyuz 7K-T spacecraft carried extra life-support equipment. The uncrewed Progress resupply ferry has a dummy escape tower and removes the stabilizer fins from the payload shroud. There have been three failed launches of a crewed Soyuz vehicle: Soyuz 18a in 1975, Soyuz T-10a in 1983 and Soyuz MS-10 in October 2018. The 1975 failure was aborted after escape-tower jettison. In 1983, Soyuz T-10a&#x27;s SAS successfully rescued the cosmonauts from an on-pad fire and explosion of the launch vehicle. Most recently, in 2018, the SAS sub-system in the payload shroud of Soyuz MS-10 successfully rescued the cosmonauts from a rocket failure 2 minutes and 45 seconds after liftoff, after the escape tower had already been jettisoned.

=== Orbital module ===

The forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module (), also known as habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. The module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. Internal volume is , living space is . On later Soyuz versions (since Soyuz TM), a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.

A hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed so that crew members could also exit through its side port (near the descent module). On the launch pad, the crew enter the spacecraft through this port. This separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in a micro-g environment differs from that of the descent module, as crew members stand or sit with their heads to the docking port. Also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the SAS system is complicated because of the orbital module.

Separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing; without separation of the orbital module, it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module. This is because the orbital module would interfere with proper deployment of the descent module&#x27;s parachutes, and the extra mass exceeds the capability of the main parachute and braking engines to provide a safe soft-landing speed. In view of this, the orbital module was separated before the ignition of the return engine until the late 1980s. This guaranteed that the descent module and orbital module would be separated before the descent module was placed in a reentry trajectory. However, after the problematic landing of Soyuz TM-5 in September 1988 this procedure was changed, and the orbital module is now separated after the return maneuver. This change was made as the TM-5 crew could not deorbit for 24 hours after they jettisoned their orbital module, which contained their sanitation facilities and the docking collar needed to attach to &quot;Mir&quot;. The risk of not being able to separate the orbital module is effectively judged to be less than the risk of needing the facilities in it, including the toilet, following a failed deorbit.

=== Descent module ===

The descent module (), also known as a reentry capsule, is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. Half of the descent module is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during reentry; this half faces forward during reentry. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute, which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the heat shield are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the descent module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere – as the pioneering Vostok spacecraft&#x27;s descent module used – but such a shape can provide no lift, resulting in a purely ballistic reentry. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and cannot be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. Thus it was decided to go with the &quot;headlight&quot; shape that the Soyuz uses – a hemispherical upper area joined by a barely angled (seven degrees) conical section to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was thought up at a time when nearly every headlight was circular. The small dimensions of the descent module led to it having only two-man crews after the death of the Soyuz 11 crew. The later Soyuz-T spacecraft solved this issue. Internal volume of Soyuz SA is ; is usable for crew (living space).

The thermal protection system on the slightly conical side walls is stood off from the structure to also provide micrometeoroid protection in orbit. 
The slightly curved heat shield on the bottom consists of &quot;21mm to 28mm thick ablator (glass-phenolic composite) which
is held by brackets approximately 15mm from the 3.5mm thick aluminum AMg-6 substrate. VIM low-density silica fibrous insulation (8mm thick) is contained in the gap between the heat shield ablator and aluminum substrate.&quot;

=== Service module ===

At the back of the vehicle is the service module (). It has a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can (instrumentation compartment, ) that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range radio communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. A non-pressurized part of the service module (propulsion compartment, ) contains the main engine and a liquid-fuelled propulsion system, using N2O4 and UDMH, for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment (). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the Sun by rotating the ship. An incomplete separation between the service and reentry modules led to emergency situations during Soyuz 5, Soyuz TMA-10 and Soyuz TMA-11, which led to an incorrect reentry orientation (crew ingress hatch first). The failure of several explosive bolts did not cut the connection between the service and reentry modules on the latter two flights.

=== Reentry procedure ===
The Soyuz uses a method similar to the 1970s-era United States Apollo command and service module to deorbit itself. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward, and the main engine is fired for deorbiting on the far side of Earth ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for reentry; the spacecraft travels on an elliptical Hohmann transfer orbit to the entry interface point, where atmospheric drag slows it enough to fall out of orbit.

Early Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously from the descent module. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detached the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saved propellant. Since the Soyuz TM-5 landing issue, the orbital module is once again detached only after the reentry firing, which led to (but did not cause) emergency situations of Soyuz TMA-10 and TMA-11. The orbital module cannot remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, as the airlock hatch between the orbital and reentry modules is a part of the reentry module, and the orbital module therefore depressurizes after separation.

Reentry firing is usually done on the &quot;dawn&quot; side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the Sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. The Soyuz craft is designed to come down on land, usually somewhere in the deserts of Kazakhstan in Central Asia. This is in contrast to the early United States crewed spacecraft and the current SpaceX Crew Dragon, which splash down in the ocean.

== Variants ==
The Soyuz spacecraft has been the subject of continuous evolution since the early 1960s. Thus several different versions, proposals and projects exist.

=== Specifications ===

=== Soyuz 7K (part of the &quot;7K-9K-11K&quot; circumlunar complex) (1963) ===


Sergei Korolev initially promoted the Soyuz A-B-V circumlunar complex (&quot;7K-9K-11K&quot;) concept (also known as L1) in which a two-man craft Soyuz 7K would rendezvous with other components (9K and 11K) in Earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle, the components being delivered by the proven R-7 rocket.

=== First generation ===

The crewed Soyuz spacecraft can be classified into design generations. Soyuz 1 through Soyuz 11 (1967–1971) were first-generation vehicles, carrying a crew of up to three without spacesuits and distinguished from those following by their bent solar panels and their use of the Igla automatic docking navigation system, which required special radar antennas. This first generation encompassed the original Soyuz 7K-OK and the Soyuz 7K-OKS for docking with the Salyut 1 space station. The probe and drogue docking system permitted internal transfer of cosmonauts from the Soyuz to the station.

The Soyuz 7K-L1 was designed to launch a crew from the Earth to circle the Moon, and was the primary hope for a Soviet circumlunar flight. It had several test flights in the Zond program from 1967–1970 (Zond 4 to Zond 8), which produced multiple failures in the 7K-L1&#x27;s reentry systems. The remaining 7K-L1s were scrapped. The Soyuz 7K-L3 was designed and developed in parallel to the Soyuz 7K-L1, but was also scrapped. Soyuz 1 was plagued with technical issues, and cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed when the spacecraft crashed during its return to Earth. This was the first in-flight fatality in the history of spaceflight.

The next crewed version of the Soyuz was the Soyuz 7K-OKS. It was designed for space station flights and had a docking port that allowed internal transfer between spacecraft. The Soyuz 7K-OKS had two crewed flights, both in 1971. Soyuz 11, the second flight, depressurized upon reentry, killing its three-man crew.

=== Second generation ===
The second generation, called &quot;Soyuz Ferry&quot; or Soyuz 7K-T, comprised Soyuz 12 through Soyuz 40 (1973–1981). It did not have solar arrays. Two long, skinny antennas were put in the solar panels&#x27;s place. It was developed out of the military Soyuz concepts studied in previous years and was capable of carrying 2 cosmonauts with Sokol space suits (after the Soyuz 11 accident). Several models were planned, but none actually flew in space. These versions were named &quot;Soyuz P&quot;, &quot;Soyuz PPK&quot;, &quot;Soyuz R&quot;, &quot;Soyuz 7K-VI&quot;, and &quot;Soyuz OIS&quot; (Orbital Research Station).

The Soyuz 7K-T/A9 version was used for the flights to the military Almaz space station.

Soyuz 7K-TM was the spacecraft used in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975, which saw the first and only docking of a Soyuz spacecraft with an Apollo command and service module. It was also flown in 1976 for the Earth-science mission, Soyuz 22. Soyuz 7K-TM served as a technological bridge to the third generation.

=== Third generation ===

The third generation Soyuz-T spacecraft, where the &quot;T&quot; stands for &quot;transport&quot; (), featured solar panels again, allowing longer missions, a revised Igla rendezvous system and new translation/attitude thruster system on the Service module. It could carry a crew of three, now wearing spacesuits. It was used from 1976 until 1986.

=== Fourth generation ===
==== Soyuz-TM (1986–2002) ====

The fourth generation Soyuz-TM spacecraft, where the &quot;M&quot; stands for &quot;modified&quot; (), were used from 1986 to 2002 for ferry flights to Mir and the International Space Station (ISS).

==== Soyuz TMA (2003–2012) ====

The Soyuz TMA spacecraft, where the &quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;anthropometric&quot; (), features several changes to accommodate requirements requested by NASA in order to service the International Space Station (ISS), including more latitude in the height and weight of the crew and improved parachute systems. It is also the first expendable vehicle to feature a digital control technology. Soyuz-TMA looks identical to a Soyuz-TM spacecraft on the outside, but interior differences allow it to accommodate taller occupants with new adjustable crew couches.

==== Soyuz TMA-M (2010–2016) ====
The Soyuz TMA-M was an upgrade of the Soyuz-TMA, using a new computer, digital interior displays, updated docking equipment, and the vehicle&#x27;s total mass was reduced by 70 kilograms. The new version debuted on 7 October 2010 with the launch of Soyuz TMA-01M, carrying the ISS Expedition 25 crew.

The Soyuz TMA-08M mission set a new record for the fastest crewed docking with a space station. The mission used a new six-hour rendezvous, faster than the previous Soyuz launches, which had, since 1986, taken two days.

==== Soyuz MS (since 2016) ====

Soyuz MS is the final planned upgrade of the Soyuz spacecraft. The &quot;MS&quot; stands for &quot;modernized systems,&quot; reflecting upgrades primarily focused on the communications and navigation subsystems. Its maiden flight was in July 2016 with mission Soyuz MS-01.

Major changes include the new Kurs-NA rendezvous system, satellite navigation, re-arranged attitude control thrusters, an improved docking mechanism, a reusable black box, power system improvements, additional micro-meteoroid protection, and a digital camera system.

== Related craft ==
The uncrewed Progress spacecraft are derived from Soyuz and are used for servicing space stations.

In 1995, China signed an agreement with Russia to acquire space technologies. The deal included the transfer of Soyuz spacecraft, life support systems, docking systems, and space suits. Leveraging this equipment, China developed its own Shenzhou spacecraft. While the Shenzhou is not a direct derivative of the Soyuz, it incorporates significant technology and design elements from the spacecraft because of the collaboration.

<text>Subotica (, ; , , ) is a city in Central Europe and the administrative center of the North Bačka District in the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. Formerly the largest city of Vojvodina region, contemporary Subotica is now the second largest city in the province, following the city of Novi Sad. According to the 2022 census, the urban area of the city (including adjacent settlement of Palić) has a population of 94,228, and the population of metro area (the administrative area of the city) stands at 123,952 people.

==Name==
The name of the city has changed frequently over time. The earliest known written name of the city was &quot;Zabotka&quot; or &quot;Zabatka&quot;, which dates from 1391. It is the origin of the current Hungarian name for the city &quot;Szabadka&quot;. According to Skok, Szabadka originated from &quot;sobotka&quot;, a Slavic diminutive of &quot;sobota&quot;, meaning &quot;a place that had a market fair on Saturday&quot; (like Szombathely or Nagyszombat), but its ending &quot;-ka&quot; was later replaced with &quot;-ica&quot;, another Slavic diminutive, by the Bunjevci. Other sources claim that the name &quot;Szabadka&quot; comes from the adjective szabad, which derived from the Slavic word for &quot;free&quot; – svobod, referring to the status of the colonists settled in this zone by the Habsburg after the Battle of Zenta.

The town was named in the 1740s after Maria Theresa of Austria, Archduchess of Austria. It was officially called &quot;Sent-Maria&quot; in 1743, but was renamed in 1779 as &quot;Maria-Theresiapolis&quot;. These two official names were also spelled in several different ways (most commonly the German &quot;Maria-Theresiopel&quot; or &quot;Theresiopel&quot;), and were used in different languages.

==Geography==
It is located in Central Europe at the Pannonian Basin at 46.07° North, 19.68° East, at the altitude of 109m, about from the border with Hungary, and is the northernmost city in Serbia. Lake Palić is in the immediate vicinity of the city. Sand dunes area Subotička Peščara is located north of the city, along the Hungarian border.

=== Climate ===
Subotica has a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) that is uncommon in Serbia except at higher elevations,


==History==
===Prehistory and antiquity===
In the Neolithic and Eneolithic periods, several important archaeological cultures flourished in this area, including the Starčevo culture, the Vinča culture, and the Tiszapolgár culture. Early Indo-European peoples settled in the territory of present-day Subotica in 3200 BC. During the Eneolithic period, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, several Indo-European archaeological cultures included areas around Subotica - the Baden culture, the Vučedol culture, the Urnfield culture and some others. Before the Iazyge conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of Illyrian, Celtic and Dacian descent inhabited this area. In the 3rd century BC, this area was controlled by the Celtic Boii and Eravisci, while in the 1st century BC, it became part of the Dacian kingdom. From the 1st century BC, the area came under the control of the Sarmatian Iazyges, who were sometimes allies and sometimes enemies of the Romans. Iazyge rule lasted until the 4th century AD, after which the region came into the possession of various other peoples and states.

===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===
In the Early Middle Ages various Indo-European and Turkic peoples and states ruled in the area of Subotica. These peoples included Huns, Gepids, Avars, Slavs and Bulgarians. Slavs settled today&#x27;s Subotica in the 6th and 7th centuries, before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the Balkans.

The Slavic tribe living in the territory of present-day Subotica were the Obotrites, a subgroup of the Serbs. In the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the Principality of Lower Pannonia (846-875), Great Moravia (833– 907) and the Bulgarian Empire.

===Late Middle Ages===

Subotica probably first became a settlement of note when people poured into it from nearby villages destroyed during the Tatar invasions of 1241–42. When &quot;Zabadka&quot;/&quot;Zabatka&quot; was first recorded in 1391, it was a tiny town in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Later, the city belonged to the Hunyadis, one of the most influential aristocratic families in the whole of Central Europe.

King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary gave the town to one of his relatives, János Pongrác Dengelegi, who, fearing an invasion by the Ottoman Empire, fortified the castle of Subotica, erecting a fortress in 1470. Some decades later, after the Battle of Mohács in 1526, Subotica became part of the Ottoman Empire. The majority of the Hungarian population fled northward to Royal Hungary. Bálint Török, a local noble who had ruled over Subotica, also escaped from the city. During the military and political havoc following the defeat at Mohács, Subotica came under the control of Serbian mercenaries recruited in Banat. These soldiers were in the service of the Transylvanian general John I Zápolya, a later Hungarian king.

The leader of these mercenaries, Jovan Nenad, established in 1526–27 his rule in Bačka, northern Banat and a small part of Syrmia and created an independent entity, with Subotica as its administrative centre. At the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself as Serbian tsar in Subotica. He named Radoslav Čelnik as the general commander of his army, while his treasurer and palatine was Subota Vrlić, a Serbian noble from Jagodina. When Bálint Török returned and recaptured Subotica from the Serbs, Jovan Nenad moved the administrative centre to Szeged.

Some months later, in the summer of 1527, Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his entity collapsed. However, after Jovan Nenad&#x27;s death, Radoslav Čelnik led a part of the army to Ottoman Syrmia, where he briefly ruled as an Ottoman vassal.

===Ottoman Empire===
The Ottoman Empire ruled the city from 1542 to 1686. At the end of this almost 150-year-long period, not much remained of the old town of &quot;Zabadka&quot;/&quot;Zabatka&quot;. As much of the population had fled, the Ottomans encouraged the settlement of the area by different colonists from the Balkans. The settlers were mostly Orthodox Serbs. They cultivated the extremely fertile land around Subotica. In 1570, the population of Subotica numbered 49 houses, and in 1590, 63 houses. In 1687, the region was settled by Catholic &quot;Dalmatas&quot; (called Bunjevci today). It was called &quot;Sobotka&quot; under Ottoman rule and was a kaza centre in Segedin sanjak at first in Budin Eyaleti until 1596, and after that in Eğri Eyaleti between 1596 and 1686.

===Habsburg Monarchy===

In 1687, about 5,000 Bunjevci settled in Bačka (including Subotica). After the decisive battle against the Ottomans at Senta led by Prince Eugene of Savoy on 11 September 1697, Subotica became part of the military border zone Theiss-Mieresch established by the Habsburg monarchy. In the meantime the uprising of Francis II Rákóczi broke out, which is also known as the Kuruc War.

In the region of Subotica, Rákóczi joined battle against the &quot;Rac National Militia&quot;. &quot;Rác&quot; was a designation for the South Slavic people (mostly Serbs and Bunjevci) and they often were referred to as &quot;rácok&quot; in the Kingdom of Hungary. In a later period &quot;rácok&quot; came to mean, above all, Serbs of Orthodox religion.

The Serbian military families enjoyed several privileges thanks to their service for the Habsburg Monarchy. Subotica gradually, however, developed from being a mere garrison town to becoming a market town with its own civil charter in 1743. When this happened, many Serbs complained about the loss of their privileges. The majority left the town in protest and some of them founded a new settlement just outside 18th century Subotica in Aleksandrovo, while others emigrated to Russia. In New Serbia, a new Russian province established for them, those Serbs founded a new settlement and also named it &quot;Subotica&quot;. In 1775, a Jewish community in Subotica was established.

It was perhaps to emphasise the new civic serenity of Subotica that the pious name &quot;Saint Mary&quot; came to be used for it at this time. Some decades later, in 1779, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria advanced the town&#x27;s status further by proclaiming it a Free Royal Town. The enthusiastic inhabitants of the city renamed Subotica once more as &quot;Maria-Theresiopolis&quot;.

This Free Royal Town status gave a great impetus to the development of the city. During the 19th century, its population doubled twice, attracting many people from all over the Habsburg monarchy. This led eventually to a considerable demographic change. In the first half of the 19th century, the Bunjevci had still been in the majority, but there was an increasing number of Hungarians and Jews settling in Subotica. This process was not stopped even by the outbreak of the Revolutions in the Habsburg monarchy (1848–49).

===Revolution of 1848–49===

During the 1848–49 Revolution, the proclaimed borders of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina included Subotica, but Serb troops could not establish control in the region. On 5 March 1849, at the locality named Kaponja (between Tavankut and Bajmok), there was a battle between the Serb and Hungarian armies, which was won by the Hungarians.

The first newspaper in the town was also published during the 1848–49 revolution—it was called &quot;Honunk állapota&quot; (&quot;State of Our Homeland&quot;) and was published in Hungarian by Károly Bitterman&#x27;s local printing company. Unlike most Serbs and Croats who confronted the Hungarians, part of the local Bunjevci people supported the Hungarian revolution.

In 1849, after the Hungarian revolution of 1848 was defeated by the Russian and Habsburg armies, the town was separated from the Kingdom of Hungary together with most of the Bačka region, and became part of a separate Habsburg province, called Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar. The administrative centre of this new province was Timișoara. The province existed until 1860. During the existence of the voivodeship, in 1853, Subotica acquired its impressive theatre.

===Austria-Hungary===
After the establishment of the Dual-Monarchy in 1867, there followed what is often called the &quot;golden age&quot; of city development of Subotica. Many schools were opened after 1867 and in 1869 the railway connected the city to the world. In 1896 an electrical power plant was built, further enhancing the development of the city and the whole region. Subotica now adorned itself with its remarkable Central European, fin de siècle architecture. In 1902 a Jewish synagogue was built in the Art Nouveau style.

Between 1849 and 1860 it was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar.

===Yugoslavia and Serbia===
Subotica had been part of Austria-Hungary until the end of World War I. In 1918, the city became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. As a result, Subotica became a border-town in Yugoslavia and did not, for a time, experience again the same dynamic prosperity it had enjoyed prior to World War I. However, during that time, Subotica was the third-largest city in Yugoslavia by population, following Belgrade and Zagreb.

In 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the Axis Powers, and its northern parts, including Subotica, were annexed by Hungary. The annexation was not considered legitimate by the international community and the city was de jure still part of Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government in exile received formal recognition of legitimacy as the representative of the country. On 11 April 1941, the Hungarian troops arrived in Subotica on the grounds that the majority of the people living in the city were ethnic Hungarians, which had been part of the Kingdom of Hungary for over 600 years. During World War II, the city lost approximately 7,000 of its citizens, mostly Serbs, Hungarians and Jews. Before the war about 6,000 Jews had lived in Subotica; many of these were deported from the city during the Holocaust, mostly to Auschwitz. In April 1944, under German administration, a ghetto was set up. In addition, many communists were executed during Axis rule. In 1944, the Axis forces left the city, and Subotica became part of the new Yugoslavia. During the 1944–45 period, about 8,000 citizens (mainly Hungarians) were killed by Partisans while re-taking the city as a retribution for supporting Axis Hungary.

In the postwar period, Subotica has gradually been modernised. During the Yugoslav and Kosovo wars of the 1990s, a considerable number of Serb refugees came to the city from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, while many ethnic Hungarians and Croats, as well as some local Serbs, left the region.

==Cityscape==
Subotica boasts a remarkable collection of buildings built in the Hungarian Secession style, a distinct variant of Art Nouveau. The Hungarian Secession style combined art nouveau vegetal ornaments and symbolic figures with traditional Hungarian motifs. It found its architectural expression in Subotica in the works of Marcell Komor, Dezső Jakab and Ferenc Raichle. Iconic buildings like the Subotica Synagogue and the Reichel Palace, are recognized as some of the finest examples of this architectural style in Europe.

The City Hall (built in 1908–1910) and the Synagogue (1902) are of especially outstanding beauty. These were built by the same architects, Marcell Komor and Dezső Jakab. Another exceptional example of art nouveau architecture is the actual Raichle Palace, which was built in 1904 by Ferenc J. Raichle.

Church buildings include the Cathedral of St. Theresa of Avila dating from 1797, the Franciscan friary dating from 1723, the Eastern Orthodox churches also from the 18th century, and the Hungarian Art Nouveau Subotica Synagogue from the early 20th century that reopened after a major renovation in 2018.

The historic National Theatre in Subotica, which was built in 1854 as the first monumental public building in Subotica, was demolished in 2007, although it was declared a historic monument under state protection in 1983, and in 1991 it was added to the National Register as a monument of an extraordinary cultural value. It is currently in the midst of renovation and is scheduled to open in 2017.

==Education==
===Universities===
*Teacher Training Faculty in the Hungarian Language of the University of Novi Sad

Tutoring of teachers in Subotica dates back to the late 18th century. After the establishment of Austria-Hungary, the second state-financed teacher training faculty of Hungary was founded in Subotica, second to Buda only. Modern history of teacher training in Subotica started in 2006, when the Sombor Teacher Training Faculty&#x27;s curriculums in the Hungarian language seceded from the faculty and became independent as the 14th faculty of the University of Novi Sad. As of 2022, the faculty offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in kindergarten teaching, elementary school teaching, disciplinatory teaching and communications, and master&#x27;s degrees in kindergarten teaching and elementary school teaching.

==Infrastructure==
A1 motorway connects the city with Novi Sad and Belgrade to the south and, across the border with Hungary, with Szeged to the north. It runs alongside the Budapest–Belgrade railway, which connects it to major European cities. As of November 2022, the line is out of order without replacement as both the Serbian and the Hungarian part of the line is currently being reconstructed. Subotica also has branch line railway connections to Sombor, Senta (with passenger service), and Szeged through Horgoš (under reconstruction with limited freight service, passenger service planned to commence in late 2023), while the former branch line to Baja through Csikéria was dismantled in the 1960s but parts of the derelict tracks are still visible in the city&#x27;s northwestern outskirts.

The city used to have a tram system, the Subotica tram system, but it was discontinued in 1974. The Subotica tram, put into operation in 1897, ran on electricity from the start. While neighbouring cities&#x27; trams at this date were often still horse-drawn, this gave the Subotica system an advantage over other municipalities including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Zagreb, and Szeged. Its existence was important for the citizens of Subotica, as well as tourists who came to visit.
Subotica has since developed a bus system, operated by JP Subotica Trans, who operates eleven city lines, eight suburban lines, and thirteen interurban lines, as well as a single international line to Szeged. Per year the buses travel some 4.7 million kilometres, and carry about ten million people.

The city is served by Subotica Airport; its runway is too short for airliners, limiting usage to mostly recreational aviation. Southwest of the city there is a 218.5 metres tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting. It is the tallest of its kind in Serbia and one of the tallest in the region.

<text>Murad V (; ; 21 September 1840 – 29 August 1904) was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 30 May to 31 August 1876. The son of Abdulmejid I, he supported the conversion of the government to a constitutional monarchy. His uncle Abdulaziz had succeeded Abdulmejid to the throne and had attempted to name his own son as heir to the throne, which spurred Murad to participate in Abdulaziz&#x27;s overthrow. But his own frail physical and mental health made his reign unstable, and Murad V was deposed in favor of his half-brother Abdul Hamid II after only 93 days.

== Life ==
=== Early life ===
Murad V was born as Şehzade Mehmed Murad on 21 September 1840 in the Çırağan Palace in Constantinople. His father was Sultan Abdulmejid I, son of Sultan Mahmud II and Bezmiâlem Sultan. His mother was Şevkefza Sultan, an ethnic Georgian.

In September 1847, aged seven, he was ceremoniously circumcised together with his younger half-brother, Şehzade Abdul Hamid.

Murad was educated in the palace. His tutors included Toprik Süleyman Efendi, who taught him the Quran, Ferrik Efendi, who taught him Ottoman Turkish language, Sheikh Hafız Efendi, who taught him Hadith (the traditions of Muhammad), Monsieur Gardet, who taught him French, and Callisto Guatelli and Italian Lombardi, who taught him to play piano.

=== Crown prince ===

After Abdulaziz ascended the throne after the death of Sultan Abdulmejid in 1861, Murad became the heir to the throne. He spent most of his time at his farmhouse in Kurbağalıdere which Abdulaziz had allocated to him. His family used to spend their winters in the crown prince&#x27;s apartments located in the Dolmabahçe Palace and the Nisbetiye Mansion.

He participated in the visits of Abdulaziz to Egypt in 1863 and to Europe in 1867. While he was appreciated by the European rulers for his kindness, his uncle, who was uncomfortable with this, had planned to send him back to Istanbul. Napoleon III and Queen Victoria showed greater interest in Murad than in Abdulaziz. Moreover, special invitations and excursions were organized for the crown prince.

He frequently communicated with the New Ottomans, who wanted a constitutional regime. Şinasi, whom he met frequently, exchanged ideas with Namık Kemal and Ziya Pasha on constitutionalism, democracy and freedom. Through Ziya Pasha and his private physician Kapoleon Efendi, he also communicated with Midhat Pasha, the leading statesman of the Tanzimat era and leader of the Young Ottomans, which was dissatisfied with Sultan Abdulaziz&#x27;s rule.

Murad was the first member of the Ottoman dynasty to become a member of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Turkey. On 20 October 1872, Murad was secretly inducted into the lodge, sponsored by his chamberlain Seyyid Bey. Murad rose through the ranks in the lodge. At one point he proposed establishing an independent Ottoman lodge to be named Envar-ı Şarkiye, &quot;Eastern Lights&quot;, with its ritual conducted in Turkish, but the plan was never realized.

==== Succession question ====
Sultan Abdulaziz tried to change the succession system in favor of his own son Şehzade Yusuf Izzeddin. For this purpose Abdulaziz set out to mollify different pressure groups and have his son gain popularity among them. During the 1867 visit to Europe, rumors spread that contrary to the rules of protocol Abdulaziz arranged Izzeddin&#x27;s reception in Paris and London before the official heir, Prince Murad. When the conservative Mahmud Nedim Pasha became the grand vizier in September 1871, he lent his support to Abdulaziz&#x27;s plans. To further legitimize his plans, Abdulaziz tactically supported a change to primogeniture in the Muhammad Ali dynasty of Egypt. By granting primogeniture to Isma&#x27;il Pasha in 1866, Abdulaziz was clearly seeking to create a positive climate of opinion about a change in favour of his own son.

=== Reign ===
==== Accession ====
As a result, Murad cooperated with the constitutionalist circles and took part in the deposition of Abdulaziz. On the night of 29–30 May 1876, the committee led by the Midhat Pasha and the Minister of War, Hüseyin Avni Pasha, deposed Abdulaziz and raised Murad to the throne.

Though Murad acceded to the throne, he was not able to retain it. He struggled to appear normal in his new role, so at odds with his previously quiet life of dabbling in music. His weak nerves, combined with alcoholism, led to a mental breakdown. His deposed uncle&#x27;s death, only days after Murad&#x27;s accession, stunned him, and, along with the distress over the abruptness with which he was brought to the throne as well as the demands put upon him as ruler, led to anxious thoughts that the world would interpret his uncle&#x27;s death as something he had ordered.

==== Illness and deposition ====
Murad began to manifest bizarre behavior that preceded his complete collapse. The government leaders called in the Viennese specialist in psychiatric disorders, Max Leidesdorf, who concluded that Murad could make a complete recovery with three months&#x27; treatment in a clinic, which the other Ottoman leaders were unwilling to attempt. A mentally competent prince on the throne formed an essential component of their plans to implement reforms with due legitimacy. Murad&#x27;s younger brother and heir to the throne, Abdul Hamid, however, appeared both physically and mentally healthy, and supported their plans to introduce parliamentary government to the Empire.

Securing a sanction by Şeyhülislam of Murad&#x27;s dethronement, as well as Abdul Hamid&#x27;s promise to proclaim a constitution, Midhat Pasha and the Ottoman government deposed Murad on 31 August 1876, on the grounds of mental illness. His reign had lasted for only 93 days. His younger half-brother ascended to the throne and was crowned Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Murad was confined to the Çırağan Palace, not being permitted to leave the palace grounds on Abdul Hamid&#x27;s orders.

=== Confinement ===
In confinement, Murad&#x27;s consort Gevherriz Hanım worked with Nakşifend Kalfa, the hazinedar Dilberengiz, the eunuch Hüseyin Ağa, and Hüsnü Bey (who had been Second Secretary of Murad) to allow for a British physician to meet with Murad to ascertain Murad&#x27;s mental fitness. When the physician arrived, Gevherriz served as translator. It is not clear how true this story is, and it is possible the physician was sent by freemasons rather than by the British.

In 1877, some nine months into confinement, Murad regained his mental faculties. The first two years of his confinement in Çırağan witnessed three attempts by supporters to free him and restore him to the throne, but all three resulted only in Abdul Hamid&#x27;s tightening the cordon that isolated Çırağan Palace from the city around it.

==== Ali Suavi incident ====
On 20 May 1878, an attempt was made to liberate Murad from the Çırağan Palace and restore him to the throne. Murad&#x27;s brothers, Şehzade Ahmed Kemaleddin and Şehzade Selim Süleyman, and sisters, Fatma Sultan and Seniha Sultan, and her husband Mahmud Celaleddin Pasha were involved in the plot. They all wanted to see Murad regain the throne. During the incident, Ali Suavi, a radical political opponent of Abdul Hamid&#x27;s authoritarian regime, stormed the palace with a band of armed refugees from the recent Russo-Turkish War. The Ottoman battleship &quot;Mesudiye&quot; was anchored offshore the palace to take Murad and announce his accession. But he did not reach the ship, and Ali Suavi&#x27;s men were unable to overcome the Beşiktaş police prefect Hacı Hasan Pasha&#x27;s fierce resistance. The plot failed, and Ali Suavi and most of his men were killed. According to &quot;İngiliz&quot; (&quot;English&quot;) Said Pasha, moments before his death, Ali Suavi took Murad&#x27;s arm and said to him, &quot;O our Lord, come, deliver us from the Muscovites.&quot; (&quot;Aman efendimiz, gel bizi Moskoflardan ḫalâṣ et.&quot;) In the aftermath, security at the Çırağan Palace was tightened.

==== Life in confinement ====

His mental faculties restored, Murad lived out a far more benign existence than that attributed to him by the Western press. Reports through the years claimed that he languished in prison, or escaped and was hiding, or lectured his brother on the Armenian troubles.

After his mother&#x27;s death in 1889, Murad focused all his love and attention on his children. Selaheddin became his companion in grief, and the two of them passed long hours together reminiscing and speculating about the future. For a time, they took an interest in the &quot;Mesnevi&quot;, taking great pleasure in reciting verses from it.

=== Death and legacy ===

At length, suffering from diabetes, Murad died at the Çırağan Palace on 29 August 1904. While his senior consort Mevhibe Kadın and his son Selahaddin reported that Murad was willing to be buried in the mausoleum of Yahya Efendi, Abdul Hamid did not approve of it. The next day, Murad&#x27;s funeral was carried out without announcement and ceremony. His body was washed and shrouded in the Topkapı Palace and then taken to the Hidayet Mosque in Bahçekapı. After the funeral procession, he was buried next to his mother, Şevkefza, in the New Mosque, Istanbul.

An important primary source about his life comes from the memoirs of one of his consorts, Filizten Hanım, written in the 1930s.

<text>Johann August Wilhelm Neander (17 January 1789 14 July 1850) was a German theologian and church historian.

==Biography==
Neander was born in Göttingen as David Mendel. His father, Emmanuel Mendel, was said to have been a Jewish peddler. While very young, his parents separated and he moved with his mother to Hamburg. After completing grammar school (&quot;Johanneum&quot;), he enrolled in a gymnasium where he discovered Plato. Some of his fellow students included Wilhelm Neumann, writer Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, and poet Adelbert von Chamisso.

== Conversion from Judaism to Christianity ==

Neander&#x27;s conversion from Judaism to Christianity was the largest change in his life and had a heavy impact upon both himself and his writing. Neander, along with his brothers and sisters, followed later by their mother, eventually left the synagogue and embraced Christianity. In his own personal conversion, Neander was influenced by the Apostle John, due to the similarity in the sentiment of John&#x27;s writings to those of Plato.

Neander&#x27;s conversion has been likened to the conversion of Saint Paul of Tarsus, due to the impact that his new faith had on his person, his work, his relationship with his students, and his attitude toward church history.

He was baptized on 25 February 1806 at the age of 17 and adopted the name of Neander, or &quot;new man&quot; on becoming a Protestant Christian.

==Studies==
Neander studied divinity at the University of Halle under Friedrich Schleiermacher. Before the end of his first year year, the events of the War of the Fourth Coalition forced Neander to move to Göttingen where he continued his studies, specialising in Plato and Plutarch, and studying theology under GJ Planck. At this point Neander decided that the original investigation of Christian history would form the great work of his life.

After university, he returned to Hamburg and passed his examination for the Christian ministry. However, after eighteen months, he decided on an academic career at Heidelberg where two vacancies had occurred in the theological faculty of the university. He became a teacher of theology in 1811 and became a professor the following year.

==Writings==
At this time, Neander published his first monograph, &quot;Über den Kaiser Julianus und sein Zeitalter&quot;. The following year he was called to University of Berlin, where he was appointed Professor of Theology. His pupils included Edmond de Pressensé.

He published a second monograph, &quot;Der Heilige Bernhard und sein Zeitalter&quot; in 1813, and a third Gnosticism in 1818 (&quot;Genetische Entwickelung der vornehmsten gnostischen Systeme&quot;). A more extended monograph followed in 1822, &quot;Der Heilige Johannes Chrysostomus und die Kirche besonders des Orients in dessen Zeitalter&quot;, with one on Tertullian in 1824 (&quot;Antignostikus&quot;). In 1824 he also cofounded the Berlin Missionary Society with Ludwig Friedrich Leopold von Gerlach, August von Bethmann-Hollweg and others in Berlin.

Neander began his work on Christian history in 1824 and published the first volume of &quot;Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche&quot; in 1825. The other volumes followed at intervals with the fifth in 1842, focusing on the period of Boniface VIII. A posthumous volume published in 1852, finished with the period of the Council of Basel.

While working on these volumes, Neander also published several other books including;

* Geschichte der Pflanzung und Leitung der christlichen Kirche durch die Apostel (1832)
* Das Leben Jesu Christi, in seinem geschichilichen Zusammenhang und seiner geschichtlichen Entwickelung (1837) (after Das Leben Jesu of David Strauss).
* Denkwürdigkeiten aus der Geschichte des Christentums (1823-1824, 2 vols., 1825, 3 vols., 1846)
* Das Eine und Mannichfaltige des christlichen Lebens (1840)
* Various papers on Plotinus, Thomas Aquinas, Theobald Thamer, Blaise Pascal, John Henry Newman, Blanco White and Thomas Arnold, and other occasional pieces (&quot;Kleine Gelegenheitsschriften&quot;, 1829).

Several of his books went through multiple editions and were translated into English.

==Death==

Neander died in Berlin on 14 July 1850, worn out and nearly blind. He died whilst dictating a page of his General history.

His grave is preserved in the Protestant &quot;Friedhof I der Jerusalems - und Neuen Kirchengemeinde&quot; (Cemetery No. I of the congregations of Jerusalem&#x27;s Church and New Church) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, south of Hallesches Tor.

After his death, a succession of volumes representing his various courses of lectures appeared (1856-1864), in addition to the Lectures on the &quot;History of Dogma&quot; (&quot;Theologische Vorlesungen&quot;), which were edited by J. L. Jacobi in 1857.

== Personal influences ==

=== People ===
Shortly after Neander&#x27;s birth, his mother Esther divorced her husband and moved the family to Hamburg where they experienced a great deal of poverty. However, Neander cherished this period in his life and described it in endearing terms as “men in all ages who…have been indebted to their pious mothers” for planting the seeds of faith in their hearts.

This period in Neander&#x27;s life had a profound effect on both his personal faith and his attitude towards life in general. Neander was often described as ‘wide-hearted’, ‘truthful’, ‘sincere’, ‘free from all the stuff of vanity’, ‘affectionate’, ‘innocent and pure of heart’.

Neander felt indebted to his teacher and later his friend and colleague Schleiermacher. “To exhibit the history of the church of Christ, as a living witness of the divine power of Christianity; as a school of Christian experience; a voice, a sounding through the ages, of instruction, of doctrine, and of reproof, for all who are disposed to listen.”

== Church history ==
Neander&#x27;s principal work was the &quot;General History of the Christian Religion and Church&quot; (&quot;Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche&quot;). Each volume contrasted an era of ecclesiastical history with the church in Neander&#x27;s own time.

His guiding principle in dealing both with history and with the contemporary condition of the church was &quot;that Christianity has room for the various tendencies of human nature, and aims at permeating and glorifying them all; that according to the divine plan these various tendencies are to occur successively and simultaneously and to counterbalance each other, so that the freedom and variety of the development of the spiritual life ought not to be forced into a single dogmatic form&quot; (Otto Pfleiderer).

<text>Philip Schaff (January 1, 1819 – October 20, 1893) was a Swiss-born, German-educated Protestant theologian and ecclesiastical historian, who spent most of his adult life living and teaching in the United States.

==Life and career==
Schaff was born in Chur, Switzerland, and educated at the gymnasium of Stuttgart. His father died when he was young and he was sent to an orphanage.

At the universities of Tübingen, Halle and Berlin, he was successively influenced by Ferdinand Christian Baur and Schmid, by Friedrich August Tholuck and Julius Müller, by David Strauss and, above all, Johann August Wilhelm Neander. At Berlin in 1841 he took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity and passed examinations for a professorship. He then traveled through Italy and Sicily as tutor to Baron Krischer. In 1842, he was &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in the University of Berlin, where he lectured on exegesis and ecclesiastical history. In 1843, he was called to become Professor of Church History and Biblical Literature in the German Reformed Theological Seminary of Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, then the only seminary of that church in America. During his time there, he spoke positively of some medieval Catholics and of the Oxford Movement and he was accused of heresy; a church council exonerated him.

On his journey Schaff stayed in England and met Edward Pusey and other Tractarians. His inaugural address on &quot;The Principle of Protestantism&quot;, delivered in German at Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1844, and published in German with an English translation by John Williamson Nevin was a pioneer work in English in the field of symbolics (that is, the authoritative ecclesiastical formulations of religious doctrines in creeds or confessions). This address and the &quot;Mercersburg theology&quot; which he taught seemed too pro-Catholic to some, and he was charged with heresy. But, at the synod at York in 1845, he was unanimously acquitted.

Schaff&#x27;s broad views strongly influenced the German Reformed Church, through his teaching at Mercersburg, through his championship of English in German Reformed churches and schools in America, through his hymnal (1859), through his labours as chairman of the committee which prepared a new liturgy, and by his edition (1863) of the Heidelberg Catechism. So much so that when the German Reformed Church, in a desire to begin producing more and better published material for the denomination published Samuel Miller&#x27;s work entitled &quot;A Treatise on Mercersburg Theology: Mercersburg and Modern Theology Compared&quot; in 1866. Schaff&#x27;s &quot;History of the Apostolic Church&quot; (in German, 1851; in English, 1853) and his &quot;History of the Christian Church&quot; (7 vols., 1858–1890), opened a new period in American study of ecclesiastical history.

In 1854, Schaff visited Europe, representing the American German churches at the ecclesiastical diet at Frankfurt am Main and at the Swiss pastoral conference at Basel. He lectured in Germany on America, and received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Berlin.

In consequence of the ravages of the American Civil War the theological seminary at Mercersburg was closed for a while and so in 1863 Schaff became secretary of the Sabbath Committee (which opposed the &quot;continental Sunday&quot;) in New York City, and held the position till 1870. In 1865 he founded the first German Sunday School in Stuttgart. In 1862–1867 he lectured on ecclesiastical history at Andover Theological Seminary.

Schaff was a member of the Leipzig Historical Society, the Netherland Historical Society, and other historical and literary societies in Europe and America. He was one of the founders, and honorary secretary, of the American branch of the Evangelical Alliance, and was sent to Europe in 1869, 1872, and 1873 to arrange for the general conference of the Alliance, which, after two postponements on account of the Franco-Prussian War, was held in New York in October 1873. Schaff was also, in 1871, one of the Alliance delegates to the emperor of Russia to plead for the religious liberty of his subjects in the Baltic provinces.

Schaff became a professor at Union Theological Seminary, New York City in 1870 holding first the chair of theological encyclopedia and Christian symbolism till 1873, of Hebrew and the cognate languages till 1874, of sacred literature till 1887, and finally of church history, until his death.

He died October 20, 1893, following a stroke. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

==Writings==

Schaff served as president of the committee that translated the American Standard Version of the Bible, though he died before it was published in 1901.

Schaff&#x27;s &quot;History of the Christian Church&quot; resembled Neander&#x27;s work, though less biographical, and was pictorial rather than philosophical. He also wrote biographies, catechisms and hymnals for children, manuals of religious verse, lectures and essays on Dante, etc. He translated Johann Jakob Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Real-Encyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche&quot; (&quot;Encyclopedia in Real Terms of Protestant Theology and Church&quot;) into English.

Working with the Evangelical Alliance and the Chicago (1893) World&#x27;s Parliament of Religions, and in Germany, through the monthly &quot;Kirchenfreund&quot;, Schaff strove earnestly to promote Christian unity and union. It was his hope that the Pope (then Leo XIII) would abandon the doctrine of infallibility and undertake the reunion of Christianity. He recognized that he was a &quot;mediator between German and Anglo-American theology and Christianity.&quot;

Schaff was commissioned to supervise the first series of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers. He was later joined by Henry Wace.

==David Schaff==
Schaff&#x27;s son, David Schley Schaff, was a Presbyterian clergyman and professor of church history. David wrote his father&#x27;s biography in 1897.

==Legacy==
Schaff was married to Mary Schley and they had seven children.

Schaff also wrote several hymns.

The Philip Schaff Prize is an award given by the American Society of Church History, which he founded in 1888, for works presenting original research on the history of Christianity.

<text>Prostaglandin analogues are a class of drugs that bind to a prostaglandin receptor.

Wider use of prostaglandin analogues is limited by unwanted side effects and their abortive potential.

==Uses==
Prostaglandin analogues such as misoprostol are used in treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers. Misoprostol and other prostaglandin analogues protect the lining of the gastrointestinal tract from harmful stomach acid and are especially indicated for the elderly on continuous doses of NSAIDs.

In the field of ophthalmology, drugs of this class are used to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in people with glaucoma. Up until the late 1970s prostaglandins were thought to raise IOP, but a paper published in 1977 showed that prostaglandin F2α lowered it, and subsequent studies found that this was due to increasing the outflow of aqueous humor, mainly by relaxing the ciliary muscle, and possibly also due to changes in extracellular matrix and to widening of spaces within the trabecular meshwork. This work led to the development of prodrugs of PGF2α, including latanoprost, an isopropyl analogue of PGF2α, approved by the FDA in 1996, bimatoprost and travoprost, both approved in 2001, and tafluprost, approved in 2012. However, there are notable side effects associated with usage, including increased eyelash growth, pigmentation of the iris, and darkening of the skin around the eye.

<text>Leonhard Hutter (also &quot;Hütter&quot;, Latinized as Hutterus; 19 January 1563 – 23 October 1616) was a German Lutheran theologian.

==Life==
He was born at Nellingen near Ulm. From 1581 he studied at the universities of Strasbourg, Leipzig, Heidelberg and Jena. In 1594 he began to give theological lectures at Jena, and in 1596 accepted a call as professor of theology at Wittenberg, where he died twenty years later.

==Works==
Hutter was a stern champion of Lutheran orthodoxy, as set down in the confessions and embodied in his own &quot;Compendium locorum theologicorum&quot; (1610; reprinted 1863), being so faithful to his master as to win the title of &quot;Luther redonatus.&quot;

In reply to Rudolf Hospinian&#x27;s &quot;Concordia discors&quot; (1607), he wrote a work, rich in historical material but one-sided in its argument, &quot;Concordia concors&quot; (1614), defending the formula of Concord, which he regarded as inspired. His &quot;Irenicum vere christianum&quot; is directed against David Pareus (1548–1622), professor primarius at Heidelberg, who in &quot;Irenicum sive de unione et synodo Evangelicorum&quot; (1614) had pleaded for a reconciliation of Lutheranism and Calvinism; his &quot;Calvinista aulico-politicus&quot; (1610) was written against the &quot;damnable Calvinism&quot; which was becoming prevalent in Holstein and Brandenburg. Another work, based on the Formula of Concord, was entitled &quot;Loci communes theologici&quot;.

<text>Statins (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are a class of medications that lower cholesterol. They are prescribed typically to people who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carriers of cholesterol play a key role in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease via the mechanisms described by the lipid hypothesis. As lipid-lowering medications, statins are effective in lowering LDL cholesterol; they are widely used for primary prevention in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as in secondary prevention for those who have developed cardiovascular disease.
Side effects of statins include muscle pain, increased risk of diabetes, and abnormal blood levels of certain liver enzymes. Additionally, they have rare but severe adverse effects, particularly muscle damage, and very rarely rhabdomyolysis.

They act by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in the production of cholesterol. High cholesterol levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease.
There are various forms of statins, some of which include atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. Combination preparations of a statin and another agent, such as ezetimibe/simvastatin, are also available. The class is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines with simvastatin being the listed medicine. In 2005, sales were estimated at in the United States. The best-selling statin is atorvastatin, also known as Lipitor, which in 2003 became the best-selling pharmaceutical in history. The manufacturer Pfizer reported sales of in 2008.

Patient compliance with statin usage is problematic despite robust evidence of the benefits.

==Medical uses==
Statins are usually used to lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce risk for illnesses related to atherosclerosis, with a varying degree of effect depending on underlying risk factors and history of cardiovascular disease. A 2022 systematic review found the absolute risk reductions for three hard outcomes – all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke – to be 0.8%, 1.3%, and 0.4%, respectively (relative risk: 9%, 29%, 14%). The association between effect size and LDL cholesterol reduction was unclear, and there was significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity between trials. Clinical practice guidelines generally recommend that people at low risk start with lifestyle modification through a cholesterol-lowering diet and physical exercise; for those unable to meet their lipid-lowering goals through such methods, statins can be helpful. The medication appears to work equally well regardless of sex, although some sex-related differences in treatment response were described.

If there is an underlying history of cardiovascular disease, it has a significant impact on the effects of statin. This can be used to divide medication usage into broad categories of &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; prevention.

===Primary prevention===
For the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2016 guidelines recommend statins for those who have at least one risk factor for coronary heart disease, are between 40 and 75 years old, and have at least a 10% 10-year risk of heart disease, as calculated by the 2013 ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort algorithm. Risk factors for coronary heart disease included abnormal lipid levels in the blood, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and smoking. They recommended selective use of low-to-moderate doses statins in the same adults who have a calculated 10-year cardiovascular disease event risk of 7.5–10% or greater. In people over the age of 70, statins decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease but only in those with a history of heavy cholesterol blockage in their arteries.

Most evidence suggests that statins are also effective in preventing heart disease in those with high cholesterol but no history of heart disease. A 2013 Cochrane review found a decrease in risk of death and other poor outcomes without any evidence of harm. For every 138 people treated for 5 years, one fewer dies; for every 49 treated, one fewer has an episode of heart disease. A 2011 review reached similar conclusions, and a 2012 review found benefits in both women and men. A 2010 review concluded that treatment without history of cardiovascular disease reduces cardiovascular events in men but not women, and provides no mortality benefit in either sex. Two other meta-analyses published that year, one of which used data obtained exclusively from women, found no mortality benefit in primary prevention.

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends statin treatment for adults with an estimated 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease that is greater than 10%. Guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend statin treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or those with diabetes, age 40–75 with LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL (1.8–4.9 mmol/dL); or in those with a 10-year risk of developing heart attack or stroke of 7.5% or more. In this latter group, statin assignment was not automatic, but was recommended to occur only after a clinician-patient risk discussion with shared decision making where other risk factors and lifestyle are addressed, the potential for benefit from a statin is weighed against the potential for adverse effects or drug interactions and informed patient preference is elicited. Moreover, if a risk decision was uncertain, factors such as family history, coronary calcium score, ankle-brachial index, and an inflammation test (hs-CRP ≥ 2.0 mg/L) were suggested to inform the risk decision. Additional factors that could be used were an LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L) or a very high lifetime risk. However, critics such as Steven E. Nissen say that the AHA/ACC guidelines were not properly validated, overestimate the risk by at least 50%, and recommend statins for people who will not benefit, based on populations whose observed risk is lower than predicted by the guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society recommend the use of statins for primary prevention, depending on baseline estimated cardiovascular score and LDL thresholds.

===Secondary prevention===
Statins are effective in decreasing mortality in people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Pre-existing disease can have many manifestations. Defining illnesses include a prior heart attack, stroke, stable or unstable angina, aortic aneurysm, or other arterial ischemic disease, in the presence of atherosclerosis. They are also advocated for use in people at high risk of developing coronary heart disease. On average, statins can lower LDL cholesterol by 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), which translates into an estimated 60% decrease in the number of cardiac events (heart attack, sudden cardiac death) and a 17% reduced risk of stroke after long-term treatment. A greater benefit is observed with high-intensity statin therapy. They have less effect than the fibrates or niacin in reducing triglycerides and raising HDL-cholesterol (&quot;good cholesterol&quot;).

No studies have examined the effect of statins on cognition in patients with prior stroke. However, two large studies (HPS and PROSPER) that included people with vascular diseases reported that simvastatin and pravastatin did not impact cognition.

Statins have been studied for improving operative outcomes in cardiac and vascular surgery. Mortality and adverse cardiovascular events were reduced in statin groups.

Older adults who receive statin therapy at time of discharge from the hospital after an inpatient stay have been studied. People with cardiac ischemia not previously on statins at the time of admission have a lower risk of major cardiac adverse events and hospital readmission two years post-hospitalization.

===Statin product offerings - comparative effectiveness===
All statins appear effective regardless of potency or degree of cholesterol reduction. Simvastatin and pravastatin appear to have a reduced incidence of side-effects.

===Women and children===
According to the 2015 Cochrane systematic review, atorvastatin showed greater cholesterol-lowering effect in women than in men compared to rosuvastatin.

In children, statins are effective at reducing cholesterol levels in those with familial hypercholesterolemia. Their long term safety is, however, unclear. Some recommend that if lifestyle changes are not enough statins should be started at 8 years old.

===Familial hypercholesterolemia===
Statins may be less effective in reducing LDL cholesterol in people with familial hypercholesterolemia, especially those with homozygous deficiencies. These people have defects usually in either the LDL receptor or apolipoprotein B genes, both of which are responsible for LDL clearance from the blood. Statins remain a first-line treatment in familial hypercholesterolemia, although other cholesterol-reducing measures may be required. In people with homozygous deficiencies, statins may still prove helpful, albeit at high doses and in combination with other cholesterol-reducing medications.

===Contrast-induced nephropathy===
A 2014 meta-analysis found that statins could reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy by 53% in people undergoing coronary angiography/percutaneous interventions. The effect was found to be stronger among those with preexisting kidney dysfunction or diabetes mellitus.

=== Chronic kidney disease ===
The risk of cardiovascular disease is similar in people with chronic kidney disease and coronary artery disease and statins are often suggested. There is some evidence that appropriate use of statin medications in people with chronic kidney disease who do not require dialysis may reduce mortality and the incidence of major cardiac events by up to 20% and are not that likely to increase the risk of stroke or kidney failure.

Asthma

Statins have been identified as having a possible adjunct role in the treatment of asthma through anti-inflammatory pathways. There is low quality evidence for the use of statins in treating asthma, however further research is required to determine the effectiveness and safety of this therapy in those with asthma.

==Adverse effects==
The most important adverse side effects are muscle problems, an increased risk of diabetes mellitus, and increased liver enzymes in the blood due to liver damage. Over 5 years of treatment statins result in 75 cases of diabetes, 7.5 cases of bleeding stroke, and 5 cases of muscle damage per 10,000 people treated. This could be due to the statins inhibiting the enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase), which is necessary to make cholesterol, but also for other processes, such as CoQ10 production, which is important for muscle function and sugar regulation.

Other possible adverse effects include neuropathy, pancreatic and liver dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. The rate at which such events occur has been widely debated, in part because the risk/benefit ratio of statins in low-risk populations is highly dependent on the rate of adverse events. A Cochrane meta-analysis of statin clinical trials in primary prevention found no evidence of excess adverse events among those treated with statins compared to placebo. Another meta-analysis found a 39% increase in adverse events in statin treated people relative to those receiving placebo, but no increase in serious adverse events. The author of one study argued that adverse events are more common in clinical practice than in randomized clinical trials. A systematic review concluded that while clinical trial meta-analyses underestimate the rate of muscle pain associated with statin use, the rates of rhabdomyolysis are still &quot;reassuringly low&quot; and similar to those seen in clinical trials (about 1–2 per 10,000 person years). Another systematic review from the International Centre for Circulatory Health of the National Heart and Lung Institute in London concluded that only a small fraction of side effects reported by people on statins are actually attributable to the statin.

===Cognitive effects===
Multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that the available evidence does not support an association between statin use and cognitive decline. A 2010 meta-review of medical trials involving over 65,000 people concluded that Statins decreased the risk of dementia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and even improved cognitive impairment in some cases. Additionally, both the Patient-Centered Research into Outcomes Stroke Patients Prefer and Effectiveness Research (PROSPER) study and the Health Protection Study (HPS) demonstrated that simvastatin and pravastatin did not affect cognition for patients with risk factors for, or a history of, vascular diseases.

There are reports of reversible cognitive impairment with statins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) package insert on statins includes a warning about the potential for non-serious and reversible cognitive side effects with the medication (memory loss, confusion).

===Muscles===
In observational studies 10–15% of people who take statins experience muscle problems; in most cases these consist of muscle pain. These rates, which are much higher than those seen in randomized clinical trials have been the topic of extensive debate and discussion.

Muscle pain and other symptoms often cause patients to stop taking a statin. This is known as statin intolerance. A 2021 double-blind multiple crossover randomized controlled trial (RCT) in statin-intolerant patients found that adverse effects, including muscle pain, were similar between atorvastatin and placebo. A smaller double-blind RCT obtained similar results. The results of these studies help explain why statin symptom rates in observational studies are so much higher than in double-blind RCTs and support the notion that the difference results from the nocebo effect; that the symptoms are caused by expectations of harm.

Media reporting on statins is often negative, and patient leaflets inform patients that rare but potentially serious muscle problems can occur during statin treatment. These create expectations of harm. Nocebo symptoms are real and bothersome and are a major barrier to treatment. Because of this, many people stop taking statins, which have been proven in numerous large-scale RCTs to reduce heart attacks, stroke, and deaths – as long as people continue to take them.

Serious muscle problems such as rhabdomyolysis (destruction of muscle cells) and statin-associated autoimmune myopathy occur in less than 0.1% of treated people. Rhabdomyolysis can in turn result in life-threatening kidney injury. The risk of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis increases with older age, use of interacting medications such as fibrates, and hypothyroidism. Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) levels are decreased in statin use; CoQ10 supplements are sometimes used to treat statin-associated myopathy, though evidence of their efficacy is lacking . The gene SLCO1B1 (&quot;Solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1&quot;) codes for an organic anion-transporting polypeptide that is involved in the regulation of the absorption of statins. A common variation in this gene was found in 2008 to significantly increase the risk of myopathy.

Records exist of over 250,000 people treated from 1998 to 2001 with the statin drugs atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis was 0.44 per 10,000 patients treated with statins other than cerivastatin. However, the risk was over 10-fold greater if cerivastatin was used, or if the standard statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin) were combined with a fibrate (fenofibrate or gemfibrozil) treatment. Cerivastatin was withdrawn by its manufacturer in 2001.

Some researchers have suggested hydrophilic statins, such as fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pravastatin, are less toxic than lipophilic statins, such as atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, but other studies have not found a connection. Lovastatin induces the expression of gene &quot;atrogin-1&quot;, which is believed to be responsible in promoting muscle fiber damage. Tendon rupture does not appear to occur.

===Diabetes===
The relationship between statin use and risk of developing diabetes remains unclear and the results of reviews are mixed. Higher doses have a greater effect, but the decrease in cardiovascular disease outweighs the risk of developing diabetes. Use in postmenopausal women is associated with an increased risk for diabetes. The exact mechanism responsible for the possible increased risk of diabetes mellitus associated with statin use is unclear. However, recent findings have indicated the inhibition of HMGCoAR as a key mechanism. Statins are thought to decrease cells&#x27; uptake of glucose from the bloodstream in response to the hormone insulin. One way this is thought to occur is by interfering with cholesterol synthesis which is necessary for the production of certain proteins responsible for glucose uptake into cells such as GLUT1.

===Cancer===
Several meta-analyses have found no increased risk of cancer, and some meta-analyses have found a reduced risk. Specifically, statins may reduce the risk of esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and possibly prostate cancer. They appear to have no effect on the risk of lung cancer, kidney cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, or bladder cancer.

===Drug interactions===
Combining any statin with a fibrate or niacin (other categories of lipid-lowering drugs) increases the risks for rhabdomyolysis to almost 6.0 per 10,000 person-years. Monitoring liver enzymes and creatine kinase is especially prudent in those on high-dose statins or in those on statin/fibrate combinations, and mandatory in the case of muscle cramps or of deterioration in kidney function.

Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice inhibits the metabolism of certain statins, and bitter oranges may have a similar effect. Furanocoumarins in grapefruit juice (i.e. bergamottin and dihydroxybergamottin) inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of most statins (however, it is a major inhibitor of only lovastatin, simvastatin, and to a lesser degree, atorvastatin) and some other medications (flavonoids (i.e. naringin) were thought to be responsible). This increases the levels of the statin, increasing the risk of dose-related adverse effects (including myopathy/rhabdomyolysis). The absolute prohibition of grapefruit juice consumption for users of some statins is controversial.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notified healthcare professionals of updates to the prescribing information concerning interactions between protease inhibitors and certain statin drugs. Protease inhibitors and statins taken together may increase the blood levels of statins and increase the risk for muscle injury (myopathy). The most serious form of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, can damage the kidneys and lead to kidney failure, which can be fatal.

===Osteoporosis and fractures===
Studies have found that the use of statins may protect against getting osteoporosis and fractures or may induce osteoporosis and fractures. A cross-sectional retrospective analysis of the entire Austrian population found that the risk of getting osteoporosis is dependent on the dose used.

==Mechanism of action==


Statins act by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Because statins are similar in structure to HMG-CoA on a molecular level, they will fit into the enzyme&#x27;s active site and compete with the native substrate (HMG-CoA). This competition reduces the rate by which HMG-CoA reductase is able to produce mevalonate, the next molecule in the cascade that eventually produces cholesterol. A variety of natural statins are produced by &quot;Penicillium&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus&quot; fungi as secondary metabolites. These natural statins probably function to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase enzymes in bacteria and fungi that compete with the producer.

===Inhibiting cholesterol synthesis===
By inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, statins block the pathway for synthesizing cholesterol in the liver. This is significant because most circulating cholesterol comes from internal manufacture rather than the diet. When the liver can no longer produce cholesterol, levels of cholesterol in the blood will fall. Cholesterol synthesis appears to occur mostly at night, so statins with short half-lives are usually taken at night to maximize their effect. Studies have shown greater LDL and total cholesterol reductions in the short-acting simvastatin taken at night rather than the morning, but have shown no difference in the long-acting atorvastatin.

===Increasing LDL uptake===
In rabbits, liver cells sense the reduced levels of liver cholesterol and seek to compensate by synthesizing LDL receptors to draw cholesterol out of the circulation. This is accomplished via proteases that cleave membrane-bound sterol regulatory element binding proteins, which then migrate to the nucleus and bind to the sterol response elements. The sterol response elements then facilitate increased transcription of various other proteins, most notably, LDL receptor. The LDL receptor is transported to the liver cell membrane and binds to passing LDL and VLDL particles, mediating their uptake into the liver, where the cholesterol is reprocessed into bile salts and other byproducts. This results in a net effect of less LDL circulating in blood.

===Decreasing of specific protein prenylation===
Statins, by inhibiting the HMG CoA reductase pathway, inhibit downstream synthesis of isoprenoids, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Inhibition of protein prenylation for proteins such as RhoA (and subsequent inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase) may be involved, at least partially, in the improvement of endothelial function, modulation of immune function, and other pleiotropic cardiovascular benefits of statins, as well as in the fact that a number of other drugs that lower LDL have not shown the same cardiovascular risk benefits in studies as statins, and may also account for some of the benefits seen in cancer reduction with statins. In addition, the inhibitory effect on protein prenylation may also be involved in a number of unwanted side effects associated with statins, including muscle pain (myopathy) and elevated blood sugar (diabetes).

===Other effects===
As noted above, statins exhibit action beyond lipid-lowering activity in the prevention of atherosclerosis through so-called &quot;pleiotropic effects of statins&quot;. The pleiotropic effects of statins remain controversial. The ASTEROID trial showed direct ultrasound evidence of atheroma regression during statin therapy. Researchers hypothesize that statins prevent cardiovascular disease via four proposed mechanisms (all subjects of a large body of biomedical research):

# Improve endothelial function
# Modulate inflammatory responses
# Maintain plaque stability
# Prevent blood clot formation

In 2008, the JUPITER trial showed statins provided benefit in those who had no history of high cholesterol or heart disease, but only in those with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, an indicator for inflammation. The study has been criticized due to perceived flaws in the study design, although Paul M. Ridker, lead investigator of the JUPITER trial, has responded to these criticisms at length.

As the target of statins, the HMG-CoA reductase, is highly similar between eukaryota and archaea, statins also act as antibiotics against archaea by inhibiting archaeal mevalonate biosynthesis. This has been shown in vivo and in vitro. Since patients with a constipation phenotype present with higher abundance of methanogenic archaea in the gut, the use of statins for management of irritable bowel syndrome has been proposed and may actually be one of the hidden benefits of statin use.

==Available forms==
The statins are divided into two groups: fermentation-derived and synthetic. Some specific types are listed in the table below. Note that the associated brand names may vary between countries.

LDL-lowering potency varies between agents. Cerivastatin is the most potent (withdrawn from the market in August 2001 due to risk of serious rhabdomyolysis), followed by (in order of decreasing potency) rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin. The relative potency of pitavastatin has not yet been fully established, but preliminary studies indicate a potency similar to rosuvastatin.

Some types of statins are naturally occurring, and can be found in such foods as oyster mushrooms and red yeast rice. Randomized controlled trials have found these foodstuffs to reduce circulating cholesterol, but the quality of the trials has been judged to be low.
Due to patent expiration, most of the block-buster branded statins have been generic since 2012, including atorvastatin, the largest-selling branded drug.


==History==
The role of cholesterol in the development of cardiovascular disease was elucidated in the second half of the 20th century. This lipid hypothesis prompted attempts to reduce cardiovascular disease burden by lowering cholesterol. Treatment consisted mainly of dietary measures, such as a low-fat diet, and poorly tolerated medicines, such as clofibrate, cholestyramine, and nicotinic acid. Cholesterol researcher Daniel Steinberg writes that while the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial of 1984 demonstrated cholesterol lowering could significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and angina, physicians, including cardiologists, remained largely unconvinced. Scientists in academic settings and the pharmaceutical industry began trying to develop a drug to reduce cholesterol more effectively. There were several potential targets, with 30 steps in the synthesis of cholesterol from acetyl-coenzyme A.

In 1971, Akira Endo, a Japanese biochemist working for the pharmaceutical company Sankyo, began to investigate this problem. Research had already shown cholesterol is mostly manufactured by the body in the liver with the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Endo and his team reasoned that certain microorganisms may produce inhibitors of the enzyme to defend themselves against other organisms, as mevalonate is a precursor of many substances required by organisms for the maintenance of their cell walls or cytoskeleton (isoprenoids). The first agent they identified was mevastatin (ML-236B), a molecule produced by the fungus &quot;Penicillium citrinum&quot;.

A British group isolated the same compound from &quot;Penicillium brevicompactum&quot;, named it compactin, and published their report in 1976. The British group mentions antifungal properties, with no mention of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. Mevastatin was never marketed, because of its adverse effects of tumors, muscle deterioration, and sometimes death in laboratory dogs. P. Roy Vagelos, chief scientist and later CEO of Merck &amp; Co, was interested, and made several trips to Japan starting in 1975. By 1978, Merck had isolated lovastatin (mevinolin, MK803) from the fungus &quot;Aspergillus terreus&quot;, first marketed in 1987 as Mevacor.

In the 1990s, as a result of public campaigns, people in the United States became familiar with their cholesterol numbers and the difference between HDL and LDL cholesterol, and various pharmaceutical companies began producing their own statins, such as pravastatin (Pravachol), manufactured by Sankyo and Bristol-Myers Squibb. In April 1994, the results of a Merck-sponsored study, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, were announced. Researchers tested simvastatin, later sold by Merck as Zocor, on 4,444 patients with high cholesterol and heart disease. After five years, the study concluded the patients saw a 35% reduction in their cholesterol, and their chances of dying of a heart attack were reduced by 42%. In 1995, Zocor and Mevacor both made Merck over .

Though he did not profit from his original discovery, Endo was awarded the 2006 Japan Prize, and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008, for his pioneering research. Endo was also inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Alexandria, Virginia in 2012. Michael S. Brown and Joseph Goldstein, who won the Nobel Prize for related work on cholesterol, said of Endo: &quot;The millions of people whose lives will be extended through statin therapy owe it all to Akira Endo.&quot;

 misleading claims exaggerating the adverse effects of statins had received widespread media coverage, with a consequent negative impact to public health. Controversy over the effectiveness of statins in the medical literature was amplified in popular media in the early 2010s, leading an estimated 200,000 people in the UK to stop using statins over a six-month period to mid 2016, according to the authors of a study funded by the British Heart Foundation. They estimated that there could be up to 2,000 extra heart attacks or strokes over the following 10 years as a consequence. An unintended effect of the academic statin controversy has been the spread of scientifically questionable alternative therapies. Cardiologist Steven Nissen at Cleveland Clinic commented &quot;We are losing the battle for the hearts and minds of our patients to Web sites...&quot; promoting unproven medical therapies. Harriet Hall sees a spectrum of &quot;statin denialism&quot; ranging from pseudoscientific claims to the understatement of benefits and overstatement of side effects, all of which is contrary to the scientific evidence.

Several statins have been approved as generic drugs in the United States:
* Lovastatin (Mevacor) in December 2001
* Pravastatin (Pravachol) in April 2006
* Simvastatin (Zocor) in June 2006
* Atorvastatin (Lipitor) in November 2011
* Fluvastatin (Lescol) in April 2012
* Pitavastatin (Livalo) and rosuvastatin (Crestor) in 2016
* Ezetimibe/simvastatin (Vytorin) and ezetimibe/atorvastatin (Liptruzet) in 2017

==Research==
Clinical studies have been conducted on the use of statins in dementia, lung cancer, nuclear cataracts, hypertension, and prostate cancer and breast cancer. There is no high quality evidence that statins are useful for pneumonia. The small number of available trials do not support the use of statins as an adjunctive therapy or as a monotherapy in multiple sclerosis.

A modelling study in the UK found that people aged 70 and older who take statins live longer in good health than those who do not, regardless of whether they have cardiovascular disease.

<text>An antiplatelet drug (antiaggregant), also known as a platelet agglutination inhibitor or platelet aggregation inhibitor, is a member of a class of pharmaceuticals that decrease platelet aggregation and inhibit thrombus formation. They are effective in the arterial circulation where classical Vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants have minimal effect.
Antiplatelet drugs are widely used in primary and secondary prevention of thrombotic disease, especially myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.

Antiplatelet therapy with one or more of these drugs decreases the ability of blood clots to form by interfering with the platelet activation process in primary hemostasis. Antiplatelet drugs can reversibly or irreversibly inhibit the process involved in platelet activation resulting in decreased tendency of platelets to adhere to one another and to damaged blood vessels&#x27; endothelium.

==Choice==
Antiplatelet medications are one of the primary recommendations for treatment of both stable and unstable ischemic heart disease. Most commonly, aspirin is used as a single medication in cases of uncomplicated stable angina, and in some cases of unstable angina. If a patient does not tolerate aspirin, ADP/P2Y inhibitors may be used as single-drug therapy instead. More severe and complicated cases are treated with dual antiplatelet therapy, or in some cases triple therapy that includes direct oral anticoagulants. Clinicians must make a choice that balances patient risk with the increased risks of bleeding associated with combination therapy.

==Dual antiplatelet therapy==
Often a combination of aspirin plus an ADP/P2Y inhibitor (such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor, or another) is used to obtain greater effectiveness than with either agent alone. This is known as &quot;dual antiplatelet therapy&quot; (or DAPT). DAPT is used in patients who have, or are at high risk of developing, unstable angina, NSTEMI myocardial infarctions, and other high-risk thrombotic conditions. Dual antiplatelet therapy has been found to significantly reduce rates of heart attacks, strokes, and overall cardiovascular death, but is not used in low-risk patients because it significantly increases the risks of major bleeding.

==Classification==
Classes of antiplatelet drugs include:
*Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitors
**Cangrelor (Kengreal)
**Clopidogrel (Plavix)
**Prasugrel (Effient)
**Ticagrelor (Brilinta)
**Ticlopidine (Ticlid)
*Adenosine reuptake inhibitors
**Dipyridamole (Persantine)
*Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitors (intravenous use only)
**Abciximab (ReoPro)
**Eptifibatide (Integrilin)
**Tirofiban (Aggrastat)
*Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitors
** Aspirin
** Triflusal (Disgren)
*Phosphodiesterase inhibitors
**Cilostazol (Pletaal)
*Protease-activated receptor-1 antagonists (which inhibit the protease-activated receptor 1 PAR-1)
**Vorapaxar (Zontivity)
*Thromboxane inhibitors
**Thromboxane receptor antagonists
***Terutroban
**Thromboxane synthase inhibitors

==Usage==

=== Prevention and treatment of arterial thrombosis ===
Prevention and treatment of arterial thrombosis is essential in patients with certain medical conditions whereby the risk of thrombosis or thromboembolism may result in disastrous consequences such as heart attack, pulmonary embolism or stroke. Patients who require the use of antiplatelet drugs are: stroke with or without atrial fibrillation, any heart surgery (especially prosthetic replacement heart valve), Coronary Heart Disease such as stable angina, unstable angina and heart attack, patients with coronary stent, Peripheral Vascular Disease/Peripheral Arterial Disease and apical/ventricular/mural thrombus.

Treatment of established arterial thrombosis includes the use of antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic therapy. Antiplatelet drugs alter the platelet activation at the site of vascular damage crucial to the development of arterial thrombosis.

*Aspirin and Triflusal irreversibly inhibits the enzyme COX, resulting in reduced platelet production of TXA2 (thromboxane – powerful vasoconstrictor that lowers cyclic AMP and initiates the platelet release reaction).
*Clopidogrel affects the ADP-dependent activation of IIb/IIIa complex
*Dipyridamole inhibits platelet phosphodiesterase, causing an increase in cyclic AMP with potentiation of the action of PGI2 – opposes actions of TXA2
*Epoprostenol is a prostacyclin that is used to inhibit platelet aggregation during renal dialysis (with or without heparin) and is also used in primary pulmonary hypertension.
*Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists block a receptor on the platelet for fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. 3 classes:
**Murine-human chimeric antibodies (e.g., abciximab)
**Synthetic non-peptides (e.g., tirofiban)
**Synthetic peptides (e.g., eptifibatide)

== Management in the perioperative period ==
Antiplatelet therapy may increase the risk of a bleed during surgery, however, stopping therapy may increase the risk of other thrombotic problems including myocardial infarction. When considering these medications and the risk-benefit ratio in the perioperative period, one must consider the risk of stopping the medication and a clot forming versus the risk of bleeding during or after the surgery if medication is continued. A 2018 Cochrane Review that included five randomized controlled trials found low-certainty evidence to suggest that continuing or discontinuing antiplatelet therapy for a non-cardiac surgery does not make a difference in mortality, major bleeds that require surgery, or ischaemic events. The same review found moderate certainty evidence that continuing or discontinuing therapy also did not have a big difference on the incidence of bleeds requiring a blood transfusion.

* Balloon angioplasty in the preoperative period——patients can proceed to surgery two weeks after the procedure.
* Bare metal stents required at least one month of DAPT
* CABG: Patients may proceed with surgery as soon as they are healed from the coronary artery bypass procedure and they do not need any specific amount of time on DAPT
* In patients with truly time-sensitive disease (defined in the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines as needing to proceed in 2–6 weeks), DAPT can be stopped 3 (three) months (90 days) after a coronary stent is placed if postponing surgery any longer would result in significant morbidity. Examples of these types of surgeries include some cancer surgery and possibly some orthopedic surgery (non-urgent/emergent fracture management). Preferably 6 to 12 months of DAPT should be continued in patients having elective surgery.

== Dental management of patients on antiplatelet drugs ==
Dentists should be aware of the risk of prolonged bleeding time in patients taking antiplatelet drugs when planning dental treatments that are likely to cause bleeding. Therefore, it is important for dentists to know how to assess patient&#x27;s bleeding risk and how to manage them.

=== Assess bleeding risk ===
Identify the likelihood and risk of dental treatment causing bleeding complications.
==Drug toxicity==
Antiplatelet drugs effect may be affected by patient&#x27;s medications, current medical conditions, food and supplements taken. Antiplatelet drugs effect may be increased or decreased. An increase in antiplatelet effect would increase the risk of bleeding and could cause prolonged or excessive bleeding. A decrease in antiplatelet effect would reduce the risk of bleeding, but increase the thromboembolic risk. Drug toxicity may increase when multiple antiplatelet drugs are used. Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common adverse event seen in many patients.

=== Medications ===
Medications that may increase antiplatelet drug effect:
* Cytotoxic drugs or drugs associated with bone marrow suppression (e.g.: leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, adalimumab, infliximab, etanercept, sulfasalazine, penicillamine, gold, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate)
* Drugs affecting the nervous system (e.g.: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs))
* NSAIDS (e.g.: aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen)
* Other anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs
Medications that may decrease antiplatelet drug effect:
* Carbamazepine
* Erythromycin
* Fluconazole
* Omeprazole
Use of NSAIDs as part of dental management of patients with vascular disease should be discouraged as NSAIDs have antiplatelet effect. Instead, simple analgesics such as paracetamol or co-codamol should be of first choice. If NSAIDs are required, the risk of bleeding increases with duration of dental treatment.

=== Medical conditions ===
Medical conditions that may increase antiplatelet drugs&#x27; effect include:

Chronic kidney failure, liver disease, haematological malignancy, recent or current chemotherapy, advanced heart failure, mild forms of inherited bleeding disorders (e.g. haemophilia, Von Willebrand&#x27;s disease) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

=== Food and supplements ===
Food and supplements that may increase antiplatelet drugs&#x27; effect:

St. John&#x27;s wort, ginkgo biloba, garlic.

<text>Friedrich August Gotttreu Tholuck (30 March 1799 – 10 June 1877), known as August Tholuck, was a German Protestant theologian, pastor, and historian, and church leader.

==Biography==
Tholuck was born at Breslau, and educated at the gymnasium and university there. He distinguished himself by his ability to learn languages. A love of Oriental languages and literature led him to exchange the University of Breslau for that of Berlin, in order to study to greater advantage, and there he was received into the house of the Orientalist Heinrich Friedrich von Diez. He was introduced to pietistic circles in Berlin, and came under the influence of Baron Hans Ernst von Kottwitz, who became his &quot;spiritual father,&quot; and of the historian Neander. Before deciding on the career of theological professor, he had in view that of a missionary in the East. Meanwhile, he was feeling the influence to a certain degree of the romantic school, and of Schleiermacher and G. W. F. Hegel too, though he never sounded the depths of their systems.

At length, in his twenty-first year, he finally decided to adopt the academical calling. In 1821 he was &quot;Privatdozent&quot; and in 1823 became professor extraordinarius of theology in Berlin, though he was at the same time active in the work of home and foreign missions. He lectured on the Old and New Testaments, theology, apologetics and the history of the church in the 18th century. In 1821 appeared his first work, &quot;Sufismus, sive theosophia Persarum pantheistica&quot;; following the same line of study he published &quot;Blütensammlung aus der morgenlandischen Mystik&quot; (1825) and &quot;Speculative Trinitätslehre des späteren Orients&quot; (1826). His well-known essay on the nature and moral influence of heathenism (1822) was published by Neander, with high commendation, in his &quot;Denkwürdigkeiten&quot;; and his &quot;Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans&quot; (1824) secured him a foremost place amongst the most suggestive, if not the most accurate, Biblical interpreters of that time.

Another work, soon translated into all the principal European languages, &quot;Die wahre Weihe des Zweiflers&quot; (1823), the outcome of his own religious history, obtained for him the permanent position of the modern Pietistic apologist of Evangelical Christianity. In 1825, with the aid of the Prussian government, he visited the libraries of England and the Netherlands, and on his return was appointed (in 1826) professor ordinarius of theology at the University of Halle, the centre of German rationalism, where he afterwards became preacher and member of the supreme consistorial council of the Evangelical State Church in Prussia. Here he made it his aim to combine in a higher unity the learning and to some extent the rationalism of Johann Salomo Semler with the devout and active pietism of A H Francke; and, in spite of the opposition of the theological faculty of the university, he succeeded in changing the character of its theology.

This he achieved partly by his lectures, but above all by his personal influence on the students, and, after 1833, by his preaching. His theological position was orthodox, but laid more stress upon Christian experience than upon rigid dogmatic belief. On the two great questions of miracles and inspiration he made great concessions to modern criticism and philosophy. His lifelong battle was on behalf of personal religious experience, in opposition to the externality of rationalism, orthodoxy or sacramentarianism. Karl Schwarz happily remarks that, as the English apologists of the 18th century were themselves infected with the poison of the deists whom they endeavoured to refute, so Tholuck absorbed some of the heresies of the rationalists whom he tried to overthrow. He was also one of the prominent members of the Evangelical Alliance, and few men were more widely known or more beloved throughout the Protestant churches of Europe and America than him. He died at Halle. As a preacher, Tholuck ranked among the foremost of his time. As a teacher, he showed remarkable sympathy and won great success. As a thinker he can hardly be said to have been endowed with great creative power.

After his commentaries (on Romans, the Gospel of John, the Sermon on the Mount and the Epistle to the Hebrews) and several volumes of sermons, his best-known books are &quot;Stunden christlicher Andacht&quot; (1839; 8th ed., 1870), intended to take the place of J H D Zschokke&#x27;s standard rationalistic work with the same title, and his reply to David Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Life of Jesus&quot; (&quot;Glaubwürdigkeit der evangelischen Geschichte&quot;, 1837).

He published at various times valuable contributions towards a history of rationalism--&quot;Vorgeschichte des Rationalismus&quot; (1853–1862), &quot;Geschichte des Rationalismus&quot; (1865), and a number of essays connected with the history of theology and especially of apologetics. His views on inspiration were indicated in his work &quot;Die Propheten und ihre Weissagungen&quot; (1860), in his essay on the &quot;&quot;Alte Inspirationslehre&quot;,&quot; in &quot;Deutsche Zeitschrift für christliche Wissenschaft&quot; (1850), and in his &quot;Gespräche über die vornehmsten Glaubensfragen der Zeit&quot; (1846; 2nd ed., 1867).

He also contributed many articles to Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Realencyklopädie,&quot; and for several years edited a journal (1830–1849), &quot;Literarischer Anzeiger.&quot;

In 1864, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Tholuck had an international influence. Philip Schaff says, &quot;Next to Neander, no German divine of the present century is more extensively known in the Protestant churches of ... America than Dr. Frederick Augustus Tholuck.&quot; In the nineteenth century, many of his books were translated into English. His popular works, such as his sermons, were also translated. American scholars were especially interested in his biblical commentaries. Several Americans, like Charles Hodge and Edward Robinson, studied with Tholuck in Halle.

<text>The Progress () is a Russian expendable cargo spacecraft. Originally developed for the Soviet space program and derived from the crewed Soyuz spacecraft, Progress has been instrumental in maintaining long-duration space missions by providing consumables like food, water, and air, as well as maintenance equipment. Since its maiden flight in 1978, Progress has supported various space stations, including Salyut 6, Salyut 7, and Mir, and remains a key resupply vehicle for the International Space Station (ISS).

Each Progress mission delivers thousands of kilograms of supplies in its pressurized module. It also carries water, fuel, and gases to replenish the station&#x27;s resources and sustain its onboard atmosphere. Beyond resupply duties, a docked Progress can maneuver or reboost the station, countering atmospheric drag and maintaining its operational altitude. When a Progress spacecraft nears the end of its design life, it is loaded with waste, undocked, and deorbited to safely disintegrate in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

, there have been 182 Progress flights, with only three failures, all occurring between 2011 and 2016. Typically, three to four Progress flights are launched to the ISS each year. Due to the variation in Progress vehicles flown to the ISS, NASA uses its own nomenclature where &quot;ISS 1P&quot; means the first Progress spacecraft to ISS.

== Design ==
The Progress spacecraft shares much of design with the crewed Soyuz spacecraft but with several modifications to make it better suited to cargo transport. It consists of three distinct sections:

* Cargo Section: This pressurized carries supplies for the crew, including maintenance items, prepackaged and fresh food, scientific equipment, and clothing. Its docking drogue, similar to that of the Soyuz, features ducting that enables fuel transfer (described below).
* Tanker Section: Replacing the Soyuz’s reentry module, this unpressurized compartment houses two tanks containing unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) fuel and dinitrogen tetroxide () oxidizer. Ducts run from these tanks around the outside of the pressurized module to connectors at the docking port, allowing automated fuel transfer. This design prevents any potential leaks of the toxic propellant from contaminating the station&#x27;s atmosphere. This section also contains water tanks.
* Propulsion Section: Located at the rear of the spacecraft, this unpressurized compartment remains largely unchanged from the Soyuz design. It contains the orientation engines used for automatic docking and can be utilized to boost the station&#x27;s orbit once docked.

The Progress spacecraft’s uncrewed and disposable design enables significant weight reduction. Unlike Soyuz, it does not require life support systems, heat shields, parachutes, or automatic crew rescue systems. Additionally, it lacks the ability to separate into multiple modules. After completing its mission, the spacecraft undocks, performs a controlled retrofire, and burns up upon reentry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

== Versions ==
Five major variants of the Progress spacecraft have been flown so far: Progress 7K-TG (1978–1990), Progress M 11F615A55 (1989–2009), Progress M1 (2000–2004), Progress M 11F615A60 (2008–2015) and Progress MS (since 2015). 

In addition, three custom Progress M variants were launched to deliver ISS modules &quot;Pirs&quot; in 2001, &quot;Poisk&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Prichal&quot; in 2021.

=== Progress 7K-TG (1978–1990) ===

There were 42 spacecraft built using the initial Progress design, the last one being launched in May 1990.

The bureau in charge of designing the freighter was TsKBEM (now RKK Energia). They began work on the design in mid-1973, assigning Progress the GRAU index 11F615A15. The design was complete by February 1974, and the first production model was ready for launch in November 1977. Progress 1 launched on 20 January 1978 aboard the same rocket used to launch the Soyuz. It still featured the same launch shroud as the Soyuz, though this was purely for aerodynamic purposes as the launch escape system had been deactivated.

This first version of Progress had a mass of and carried of cargo, or 30% of its launch mass. It had the same diameter as the Soyuz at , but was in length – slightly longer. The autonomous flight time was 3 days, the same time as that of the Soyuz ferry. It could spend 30 days docked. Progress always docked to the aft port of the station it was resupplying (the aft being where the main rocket engines of the station and their tankage, for refueling by the Progress, are located).

=== Progress M 11F615A55 (1989–2009) ===


The upgraded Progress M (GRAU: 11F615A55, manufacturer&#x27;s designation: 7K-TGM) was first launched in August 1989. The first 43 flights all went to Mir; following Mir&#x27;s re-entry, Progress was used as the resupply vehicle for the International Space Station. As of December 2020, there have been over 80 flights (over different configurations) to the ISS and more are scheduled.

The Progress M is essentially the same spacecraft as the Progress, but it features improvements based on the Soyuz-T and Soyuz-TM designs. It can spend up to 30 days in autonomous flight and is able to carry more. Also, unlike the old Progress crafts, it can return items to Earth. This is accomplished by using the VBK-Raduga capsule, which can carry up to of cargo. It is long and in diameter and has a &quot;dry mass&quot; of . Progress M can also dock to the forward port of the station and still transfer fuel. It uses the same rendezvous system as the Soyuz, and it features solar panels for the first time.

In addition to the traditional Progress-M spacecraft, three modified &quot;space tug&quot; versions were built to deliver modules to the ISS. These variants lacked a pressurized cargo section and had a heavily modified tanker section. Progress DC-1 delivered &quot;Pirs&quot; in 2001, Progress M-MIM2 delivered &quot;Poisk&quot; in 2009 and Progress M-UM delivered &quot;Prichal&quot; in 2021.

=== Progress M 11F615A60 (2008–2015) ===

A new modification of the Progress spacecraft, with new TsVM-101 digital flight computer and MBITS digital telemetry system, was first launched on 26 November 2008, at 12:38 UTC from the Kazakhstan&#x27;s Baikonur Cosmodrome spaceport aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket. The first spacecraft of this series was Progress M-01M.

The spacecraft belongs to the so-called 400 series (GRAU: 11F615A60), and all modifications applied to it were subsequently used in the production of new Soyuz TMA-01M crewed spacecraft.

Progress M-27M was launched on 28 April 2015, but communication with the vessel was lost soon after, and it was destroyed as it re-entered the atmosphere on 8 May 2015. The last launch was Progress M-29M.

=== Progress M1 (2000–2004) ===
Progress M1 is another variant, capable of carrying more propellant (but less total cargo) to the ISS. There have been 11 of these flights.

=== Progress M2 ===
Progress M2 was a planned variant, which was a proposed design for the proposed Mir-2 space station, but was dropped due to financial issues. The M2 variant would have a larger service module for larger cargo or space station modules and would have been launched on a Zenit rocket as the spacecraft is bigger.

=== Progress MS (2015–present) ===

Progress MS (Modernized Systems) is an improved variant, largely focused on replacing pieces of outdated analogue equipment, many of which were no longer in production, with new digital systems. Key updates include a new flight control system, the new Kurs-NA rendezvous system, a new communications and telemetry system, additional micro-meteoroid protection, an improved docking mechanism, a digital camera system, and a CubeSat deployment platform. The first Progress MS flight launched on 21 December 2015.

== Current status ==
Progress spacecraft are used to resupply the International Space Station (ISS) as of 2021. Between 1 February 2003 and 26 July 2005, they were the only spacecraft available to transport large quantities of supplies to the station, as the Space Shuttle fleet was grounded after the breakup of &quot;Columbia&quot; at the end of STS-107. For ISS missions, the Progress M1 variant is used, which moves the water tanks from the propellant and refueling module to the pressurized section, and as a result is able to carry more propellant. Progress M-UM, the final flight of a Progress-M spacecraft, was launched 24 November 2021 on a Soyuz 2.1b. As of 7/1/2021, there have been 170 Progress flights to the ISS.

On 9 July 2018, Progress MS-09 broke a previous record by reaching the ISS in 3 hours and 48 minutes, carrying about of cargo and supplies. It delivered food, fuel and supplies, including 705 kg of propellant, of oxygen and air, of water.

The European Space Agency (ESA) operated its own type of robotic supply freighter, the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV). The first of these, named &quot;Jules Verne&quot;, was launched at 04:03 UTC on 9 March 2008. ATVs can carry up to 8.85 tonnes of cargo into space, roughly three times as much as the Progress, and were launched annually by Ariane 5 rockets from 2011-2014 as part of ESA contribution to ISS upkeep. The design is adopted as the Service Module of the Orion spacecraft.

NASA&#x27;s planned Orion spacecraft was initially designed to have an uncrewed variant of the Crew module similar to Progress; however, this capability was removed in 2009. As of 2023, SpaceX&#x27;s Dragon spacecraft and Northrop Grumman&#x27;s Cygnus spacecraft handle American logistics to the International Space Station.

<doc id="178208" wikidata="Q287460" url="?curid=178208" title="Angus Wilson">
<text>Sir Angus Frank Johnstone-Wilson, CBE (11 August 191331 May 1991) was an English novelist and short story writer. He was one of England&#x27;s first openly gay authors. He was awarded the 1958 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for &quot;The Middle Age of Mrs Eliot&quot; and later received a knighthood for his services to literature.

==Biography==

Wilson was born in Bexhill, Sussex, England, to an English father, William Johnstone-Wilson, and South African mother, Maude (née Caney), of a wealthy merchant family of Durban. Wilson&#x27;s grandfather had served in a prestigious Scottish army regiment, and owned an estate in Dumfriesshire, where William Johnstone-Wilson (despite being born at Haymarket) was raised, and where he subsequently lived.

Wilson was educated at Westminster School and Merton College, Oxford, and in 1937 became a librarian in the British Museum&#x27;s Department of Printed Books, working on the new General Catalogue. Previous employment included tutoring, catering, and co-managing a restaurant with his brother.

During World War II, he worked in the Naval section at the code-breaking establishment, Bletchley Park, translating Italian Naval codes. A wearer of large, brightly coloured bow-ties and shirts, Sinclair McKay described him as one of the &quot;famous homosexuals&quot; at Bletchley. He was billeted with a &quot;kind family&quot; in the village of Simpson, who worried about his &quot;prodigious consumption&quot; of cigarettes by coughing theatrically. They only read (and re-read) John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Holy War&quot;. The &quot;claustrophobia&quot; of the billet may have contributed to his increasing depression and his &quot;Pompeiian mood swings&quot;. The work situation was stressful and led to a nervous breakdown, for which he was treated by Rolf-Werner Kosterlitz. A colleague said when he threw an inkpot at a Wren that &quot;Angus isn&#x27;t really mad. He threw inkpots at all the right people!&quot;

A Wren, Dorothy Robertson, was taught traffic analysis by Wilson and another instructor. She recalled him as:

Wilson returned to the Museum after the end of the war, and it was there that he met Tony Garrett (born 1929), who was to be his companion for the rest of his life. Years later their life together was sympathetically portrayed in the BBC2 film &quot;Angus and Tony&quot; (1984), directed by Jonathan Gili. It was one of the first depictions of the life of a gay couple on British television.

Wilson&#x27;s first publication was a collection of short stories, &quot;The Wrong Set&quot; (1949), followed quickly by the daring novel &quot;Hemlock and After&quot;, which was a great success, prompting invitations to lecture in Europe.

Wilson worked as a reviewer, and in 1955 he resigned from the British Museum to write full-time (although his financial situation did not justify doing so) and moved to Suffolk.

He was instrumental in getting Colin Wilson&#x27;s first novel published in 1956 and from 1957 he gave lectures further afield, in Japan, Switzerland, Australia, and the USA. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1968 New Year Honours, and received many literary honours in succeeding years. He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1980 Birthday Honours, and was President of the Royal Society of Literature from 1982 to 1988. His remaining years were affected by ill health, and he died of a stroke at a nursing home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 31 May 1991, aged 77.

Wilson&#x27;s writing, which has a strongly satirical vein, expresses his concern with preserving a liberal humanistic outlook in the face of fashionable doctrinaire temptations. Several of his works were adapted for television. He was Professor of English Literature at the University of East Anglia from 1966 to 1978, and jointly helped to establish their creative writing course at master&#x27;s level in 1970, which was then a groundbreaking initiative in the United Kingdom.

Wilson&#x27;s medals, then in private ownership, were shown on the BBC Television programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in August 2018.

<text>Julius August Ludwig Wegscheider (27 September 177127 January 1849), was a German Protestant theologian.

==Life==
Wegscheider was born at Küblingen (now a part of Schöppenstedt, Lower Saxony). He studied theology at the University of Helmstedt, where he was a pupil of Heinrich Philipp Konrad Henke. From 1795 to 1805, he worked as a tutor to the family of a wealthy Hamburg merchant. In 1805 he presented a dissertation titled &quot;Graecorum mysteriis religioni non obtrudendis&quot; at the University of Göttingen. He then served as a professor of theology at the University of Rinteln (1806–1810), and at the University of Halle from 1810 onwards.

Wegscheider was a leading figure of dogmatic theological rationalism—for instance, he considered supernatural revelation to be an impossibility. Because of his rationalist teachings, he, along with his colleague Wilhelm Gesenius, were attacked by followers of Supernaturalism, creating a situation that led to a government investigation (1830). Ultimately, he retained his office at Halle, but lost his former influence.

<doc id="178210" wikidata="Q955332" url="?curid=178210" title="Lipid-lowering agent">
<text>Lipid-lowering agents, also sometimes referred to as hypolipidemic agents, cholesterol-lowering drugs, or antihyperlipidemic agents are a diverse group of pharmaceuticals that are used to lower the level of lipids and lipoproteins, such as cholesterol, in the blood (hyperlipidemia). The American Heart Association recommends the descriptor &#x27;lipid lowering agent&#x27; be used for this class of drugs rather than the term &#x27;hypolipidemic&#x27;.

== Classes ==

The several classes of lipid lowering drugs may differ in both their impact on the cholesterol profile and adverse effects. For example, some may lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels more so than others, while others may preferentially increase high density lipoprotein (HDL). Clinically, the choice of an agent depends on the patient&#x27;s cholesterol profile, cardiovascular risk, and the liver and kidney functions of the patient, evaluated against the balancing of risks and benefits of the medications. In the United States, this is guided by the evidence-based guideline most recently updated in 2018 by the American College of Cardiology &amp; American Heart Association.

===Established===
* Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are particularly well suited for lowering LDL, the cholesterol with the strongest links to vascular diseases. In studies using standard doses, statins have been found to lower LDL-C by 18% to 55%, depending on the specific statin being used. A risk exists of muscle damage (myopathy and rhabdomyolysis) with statins. Hypercholesterolemia is not a risk factor for mortality in persons older than 70 years and risks from statin drugs are more increased after age 85. 
* Fibrates are indicated for hypertriglyceridemia. Fibrates typically lower triglycerides by 20% to 50%. Level of the good cholesterol HDL is also increased. Fibrates may decrease LDL, though generally to a lesser degree than statins. Similar to statins, the risk of muscle damage exists.
* Nicotinic acid, like fibrates, is also well suited for lowering triglycerides by 20–50%. It may also lower LDL by 5–25% and increase HDL by 15–35%. Niacin may cause hyperglycemia and may also cause liver damage. The niacin derivative acipimox is also associated with a modest decrease in LDL. Introduced in 1955.
* Bile acid sequestrants (resins, e.g. cholestyramine) are particularly effective for lowering LDL-C by sequestering the cholesterol-containing bile acids released into the intestine and preventing their reabsorption from the intestine. It decreases LDL by 15–30% and raises HDL by 3–5%, with little effect on triglycerides, but can cause a slight increase. Bile acid sequestrants may cause gastrointestinal problems and may also reduce the absorption of other drugs and vitamins from the gut.
* Ezetimibe is a selective inhibitor of dietary cholesterol absorption.
* Lomitapide is a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor.
* PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies for refractory cases. (e.g. Evolocumab, Inclisiran) They are used in combination with statins.
* Probucol decreases LDL independently of the LDL receptor, and decreases HDL-C by enhancing its liver receptor and reducing ABCA1-dependent transport. The reduction of HDL-C, combined with early uncertainties around its mechanism of action, has historically lead to its discontinuation and replacement by statins in Western countries. However, instead of lowering reverse cholesterol transport by HDL particles, probucol seems to increase it. Introduced in the 1970s. It predated the statins by about a decade.

=== Alternative ===

* Lecithin has been shown to effectively decrease cholesterol concentration by 33%, lower LDL by 38% and increase HDL by 46%.
* Phytosterols may be found naturally in plants. Similar to ezetimibe, phytosterols reduce the absorption of cholesterol in the gut, so they are most effective when consumed with meals. However, their precise mechanism of action differs from ezetimibe.
* Omega-3 supplements taken at high doses can reduce levels of triglycerides. They are associated with a very modest increase in LDL (~5%).
* Choline
* Pycnogenol
* Berberine
* Red yeast rice is the natural source from which statins were discovered, but the FDA currently disallows any RYR with significant amounts of statin to be sold as a dietary supplement 
* Boswellia serrata
* L-arginine may enhance the effects of a Statin, but will not lead to a reduction in cholesterol alone.
* Flaxseed oil

==Research==
Investigational classes of hypolipidemic agents:
* CETP inhibitors (cholesteryl ester transfer protein), 1 candidate is in trials. (Anacetrapib) It is expected that these drugs will mainly increase HDL while lowering LDL
* Squalene synthase inhibitor
* ApoA-1 Milano
* Succinobucol (AGI-1067), a novel antioxidant, failed a phase-III trial.
* Apoprotein-B inhibitor mipomersen (approved by the FDA in 2013 homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.).
* Bempedoic acid, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor

<text>An anticoagulant, commonly known as a blood thinner, is a chemical substance that prevents or reduces the coagulation of blood, prolonging the clotting time. Some occur naturally in blood-eating animals, such as leeches and mosquitoes, which help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain blood.

As a class of medications, anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders. Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are taken by many people in pill or tablet form, and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals. Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment, such as sample tubes, blood transfusion bags, heart–lung machines, and dialysis equipment. One of the first anticoagulants, warfarin, was initially approved as a rodenticide.

Anticoagulants are closely related to antiplatelet drugs and thrombolytic drugs by manipulating the various pathways of blood coagulation. Specifically, antiplatelet drugs inhibit platelet aggregation (clumping together), whereas anticoagulants inhibit specific pathways of the coagulation cascade, which happens after the initial platelet aggregation but before the formation of fibrin and stable aggregated platelet products.

Common anticoagulants include warfarin and heparin.
==Medical uses==
The use of anticoagulants is a decision based on the risks and benefits of anticoagulation. The biggest risk of anticoagulation therapy is the increased risk of bleeding. In otherwise healthy people, the increased risk of bleeding is minimal, but those who have had recent surgery, cerebral aneurysms, and other conditions may have too great a risk of bleeding. Generally, the benefit of anticoagulation is preventing or reducing the progression of a thromboembolic disease. Some indications for anticoagulant therapy that are known to have benefit from therapy include:
* Atrial fibrillation — commonly forms an atrial appendage clot
* Coronary artery disease
* Deep vein thrombosis — can lead to pulmonary embolism
* Ischemic stroke
* Hypercoagulable states (e.g., Factor V Leiden) — can lead to deep vein thrombosis
* Mechanical heart valves
* Myocardial infarction
* Pulmonary embolism
* Restenosis from stents
* Cardiopulmonary bypass (or any other surgeries requiring temporary aortic occlusion)
* Heart failure

In these cases, anticoagulation therapy prevents the formation or growth of dangerous clots.

The decision to begin therapeutic anticoagulation often involves the use of multiple bleeding risk predictable outcome tools as non-invasive pre-test stratifications due to the potential for bleeding while on blood thinning agents. Among these tools are HAS-BLED, ATRIA, HEMORR2HAGES, and CHA2DS2-VASc. The risk of bleeding using the risk assessment tools above must then be weighed against thrombotic risk to formally determine the patient&#x27;s overall benefit in starting anticoagulation therapy.

There is no evidence to indicate that adding anticoagulant therapy to standard treatment has a benefit for people with cerebral small vessel disease but not dementia, and there is an increased risk of a person with this disease experiencing a bleed with this approach.

==Adverse effects==
The most serious and common adverse side effects associated with anticoagulants are increased risk of bleeding, both nonmajor and major bleeding events. The bleeding risk depends on the class of anticoagulant agent used, the patient&#x27;s age, and pre-existing health conditions. Warfarin has an estimated incidence of bleeding of 15-20% per year and a life-threatening bleeding rate of 1-3% per year. Newer non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants appear to have fewer life-threatening bleeding events than warfarin. Additionally, patients aged 80 years or more may be especially susceptible to bleeding complications, with a rate of 13 bleeds per 100 person-years. Bleeding risk is especially important to consider in patients with renal impairment and NOAC therapy because all NOACs, to some extent, are excreted by the kidneys. Thus, patients with renal impairment may be at higher risk of increased bleeding.

In people with cancer, a systematic review has found warfarin had no effect on death rate or the risk of blood clots. However, it did increase the risk of major bleeding in 107 more people per 1000 population and minor bleeding in 167 more people per 1000 population. Apixaban had no effect on mortality, recurrence of blood clots in blood vessels, or major or minor bleeding. However, this finding comes only from one study.

Nonhemorrhagic adverse events are less common than hemorrhagic adverse events but should still be monitored closely. Nonhemorrhagic adverse events of warfarin include skin necrosis, limb gangrene, and purple toe syndrome. Skin necrosis and limb gangrene are most commonly observed on the third to eighth day of therapy. The exact pathogenesis of skin necrosis and limb gangrene is not completely understood but it is believed to be associated with warfarin&#x27;s effect on inhibiting the production of protein C and protein S. Purple toe syndrome typically develops three to eight weeks after initiation of warfarin therapy. Other adverse effects of warfarin are associated with depletion of vitamin K, which can lead to inhibition of G1a proteins and growth arrest-specific gene 6, which can lead to increased risk of arterial calcification and heart valve, especially if too much Vitamin D is present. Warfarin&#x27;s interference with G1a proteins has also been linked to abnormalities in fetal bone development in mothers who were treated with warfarin during pregnancy. Long-term warfarin and heparin usage have also been linked to osteoporosis.

Another potentially severe complication associated with heparin use is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). There are two distinct types: HIT 1) immune-mediated and 2) non-immune-mediated. Immune-mediated HIT most commonly arises five to ten days after exposure to heparin. Pathogenesis of immune-mediated HIT is believed to be caused by heparin-dependent immunoglobulin antibodies binding to platelet factor 4/heparin complexes on platelets, leading to widespread platelet activation.

== Interactions ==

Foods and food supplements with blood-thinning effects include nattokinase, lumbrokinase, beer, bilberry, celery, cranberries, fish oil, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, ginseng, green tea, horse chestnut, licorice, niacin, onion, papaya, pomegranate, red clover, soybean, St. John&#x27;s wort, turmeric, wheatgrass, and willow bark. Many herbal supplements have blood-thinning properties, such as danshen and feverfew. Multivitamins that do not interact with clotting are available for patients on anticoagulants.

However, some foods and supplements encourage clotting. These include alfalfa, avocado, cat&#x27;s claw, coenzyme Q10, and dark leafy greens such as spinach. Excessive intake of the food mentioned above should be avoided while taking anticoagulants, or if coagulability is being monitored, their intake should be kept approximately constant so that anticoagulant dosage can be maintained at a level high enough to counteract this effect without fluctuations in coagulability.

Grapefruit interferes with some anticoagulant drugs, increasing the time it takes for them to be metabolized out of the body, and should be eaten with caution when on anticoagulant drugs.

Anticoagulants are often used to treat acute deep-vein thrombosis. People using anticoagulants to treat this condition should avoid using bed rest as a complementary treatment because there are clinical benefits to continuing to walk and remaining mobile while using anticoagulants in this way. Bed rest while using anticoagulants can harm patients in circumstances in which it is not medically necessary.

==Types==
Several anticoagulants are available. Warfarin, other coumarins, and heparins have long been used. Since the 2000s, several agents have been introduced that are collectively referred to as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), previously named novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. These agents include direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban), and they have been shown to be as good or possibly better than the coumarins with less serious side effects. The newer anticoagulants (NOACs/DOACs) are more expensive than the traditional ones and should be used in caring for patients with kidney problems.

===Coumarins (vitamin K antagonists)===

These oral anticoagulants are derived from coumarin found in many plants. A prominent member of this class, warfarin (Coumadin), was found to be the anticoagulant most prescribed in a large multispecialty practice. The anticoagulant effect takes at least 48 to 72 hours to develop. Where an immediate effect is required, heparin is given concomitantly. These anticoagulants are used to treat patients with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and to prevent emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and mechanical prosthetic heart valves. Other examples are acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, atromentin, and phenindione.

The coumarins brodifacoum and difenacoum are used as mammalicides (particularly as rodenticides) but are not used medically.

===Heparin and derivative substances===
Heparin is the most widely used intravenous clinical anticoagulant worldwide. Heparin is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan. There are three major categories of heparin: unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and ultra-low-molecular weight heparin (ULMWH). Unfractionated heparin is usually derived from pig intestines and bovine lungs. UFH binds to the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin III (AT), causing a conformational change that results in its activation. The activated AT then inactivates factor Xa, thrombin, and other coagulation factors. Heparin can be used &quot;in vivo&quot; (by injection), and also &quot;in vitro&quot; to prevent blood or plasma clotting in or on medical devices. In venipuncture, Vacutainer brand blood collecting tubes containing heparin usually have a green cap.

====Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)====
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is produced through a controlled depolymerization of unfractionated heparin. LMWH exhibits a higher anti-Xa/anti-IIa activity ratio and is useful as it does not require monitoring of the APTT coagulation parameter and has fewer side effects.

===Synthetic pentasaccharide inhibitors of factor Xa===
* Fondaparinux is a synthetic sugar composed of the five sugars (pentasaccharides) in heparin that bind to antithrombin. It is a smaller molecule than low molecular-weight heparin.
* Idraparinux
* Idrabiotaparinux

=== Direct oral ===
The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were introduced in and after 2008. There are five DOACs currently on the market: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban. They were also previously referred to as &quot;new/novel&quot; and &quot;non-vitamin K antagonist&quot; oral anticoagulants (NOACs).

Compared to warfarin, DOACs have a rapid onset action and relatively short half-lives; hence, they carry out their function more rapidly and effectively, allowing drugs to reduce their anticoagulation effects quickly. Routine monitoring and dose adjustments of DOACs are less important than for warfarin, as they have better predictable anticoagulation activity. DOAC monitoring, including laboratory monitoring and a complete medication review, should generally be conducted before initiation of a DOAC, 1–3 months after initiation, and then every 6–12 months afterwards.

Both DOACs and warfarin are equivalently effective, but compared to warfarin, DOACs have fewer drug interactions, no known dietary interactions, a wider therapeutic index, and have conventional dosing that does not require dose adjustments with constant monitoring. However, there is no countermeasure for most DOACs, unlike for warfarin; nonetheless, the short half-lives of DOACs will allow their effects to recede swiftly. A reversal agent for dabigatran, idarucizumab, is currently available and approved for use by the FDA. Rates of adherence to DOACs are only modestly higher than adherence to warfarin among patients prescribed these drugs. Thus, adherence to anticoagulation is often poor despite hopes that DOACs would lead to higher adherence rates.

DOACs are significantly more expensive than warfarin, but the patients on DOACs may experience reduced lab costs as they do not need to monitor their INR.

====Direct factor Xa inhibitors====

Drugs such as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban work by inhibiting factor Xa directly (unlike heparins and fondaparinux, which work via antithrombin activation).
Also included in this category are betrixaban from Portola Pharmaceuticals, the discontinued darexaban (YM150) from Astellas, and, more recently, the discontinued letaxaban (TAK-442) from Takeda and eribaxaban (PD0348292) from Pfizer.
Betrixaban is significant as it was in 2018, the only oral factor Xa inhibitor approved by the FDA for use in acutely medically ill patients. Darexaban development was discontinued in September 2011; in a trial for prevention of recurrences of myocardial infarction in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the drug did not demonstrate effectiveness, and the risk of bleeding was increased by approximately 300%. The development of letaxaban for acute coronary syndrome was discontinued in May 2011 following negative results from a Phase II study.

====Direct thrombin inhibitors====

Another type of anticoagulant is the direct thrombin inhibitor. Current members of this class include the bivalent drugs hirudin, lepirudin, and bivalirudin and the monovalent drugs argatroban and dabigatran. An oral direct thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran (Exanta), was denied approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2004 and was pulled from the market entirely in February 2006 after reports of severe liver damage and heart attacks. In November 2010, dabigatran etexilate was approved by the FDA to prevent thrombosis in atrial fibrillation.

==== Relevance to dental treatments ====
As in any invasive procedure, patients on anticoagulation therapy have an increased risk for bleeding, and caution should be used along with local hemostatic methods to minimize bleeding risk during the operation as well as postoperatively. However, with regards to DOACs and invasive dental treatments, there has not been enough clinical evidence and experience to prove any reliable adverse effects, relevance or interaction between these two. Further clinical prospective studies on DOACs are required to investigate the bleeding risk and hemostasis associated with surgical and dental procedures.

Recommendations of modifications to the usage/dosage of DOACs before dental treatments are made based on the balance of the bleeding risk of each procedure and also the individual&#x27;s own bleeding risks and renal functionality. With low-bleeding-risk dental procedures, it is recommended that DOACs be continued by the patient to avoid any increase in the risk of a thromboembolic event. For dental procedures with a higher risk of bleeding complications (i.e. complex extractions, adjacent extractions leading to a large wound, or more than three extractions), the recommended practice is for the patient to miss or delay a dose of their DOAC before such procedures to minimize the effect on bleeding risk.

===Antithrombin protein therapeutics===
The antithrombin protein is used as a protein therapeutic that can be purified from human plasma or produced recombinantly (for example, Atryn, produced in the milk of genetically modified goats).

The FDA approves Antithrombin as an anticoagulant for preventing clots before, during, or after surgery or birthing in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency.

===Other===
Many other anticoagulants exist in research and development, diagnostics, or as drug candidates.
* Batroxobin, a toxin from snake venom, clots platelet-rich plasma without affecting platelet functions (cleaves fibrinogen).
* Hementin is an anticoagulant protease from the salivary glands of the giant Amazon leech, &quot;Haementeria ghilianii&quot;.
* Vitamin E
* Alcoholic beverage

==Reversal agents==

With the growing number of patients taking oral anticoagulation therapy, studies into reversal agents are gaining increasing interest due to major bleeding events and the need for urgent anticoagulant reversal therapy. Reversal agents for warfarin are more widely studied, and established guidelines for reversal exist due to a longer history of use of warfarin and the ability to get a more accurate measurement of anticoagulation effect in a patient via measuring the INR (International Normalized Ratio). In general, vitamin K is most commonly used to reverse the effect of warfarin in non-urgent settings. However, in urgent settings or settings with extremely high INR (INR &gt;20), hemostatic reversal agents such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP), recombinant factor VIIa, and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) have been utilized with proven efficacy. Specifically with warfarin, four-factor PCC (4F-PCC) has been shown to have superior safety and mortality benefits compared to FPP in lowering INR levels.

Although specific antidotes and reversal agents for DOACs are not as widely studied, idarucizumab (for dabigatran) and andexanet alfa (for factor Xa inhibitor) have been used in clinical settings with varying efficacy. Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody, approved by the US FDA in 2015, that reverses the effect of dabigatran by binding to both free and thrombin-bound dabigatran. Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified human factor Xa decoy that reverses the effect of factor Xa inhibitors by binding at the active sites of factor Xa inhibitor and making it catalytically inactive. Andexanet alfa was approved by the US FDA in 2018. Another drug called ciraparantag, a potential reversal agent for direct factor Xa inhibitors, is still under investigation. Additionally, hemostatic reversal agents have also been used with varying efficacy to reverse the effects of DOACs.

==Coagulation inhibitor measurement==
A Bethesda unit (BU) is a measure of blood coagulation inhibitor activity. It is the amount of inhibitor that will inactivate half of a coagulant during the incubation period. It is the standard measure used in the United States and is so named because it was adopted as a standard at a conference in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Laboratory use==
If blood is allowed to clot, laboratory instruments, blood transfusion bags, and medical and surgical equipment will get clogged up and non-operational. In addition, test tubes used for laboratory blood tests will have chemicals added to stop blood clotting. Besides heparin, most of these chemicals bind calcium ions, preventing the coagulation proteins from using them.
* Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) strongly and irreversibly chelates (binds) calcium ions, preventing blood from clotting.
* Citrate is in liquid form in the tube and is used for coagulation tests and blood transfusion bags. It binds calcium but not as strongly as EDTA. The correct proportion of this anticoagulant to blood is crucial because of the dilution, which can be reversed with the addition of calcium. Formulations include plain sodium citrate, acid-citrate-dextrose, and more.
* Oxalate has a mechanism similar to that of citrate. It is the anticoagulant used in fluoride/oxalate tubes to determine glucose and lactate levels. The fluoride inhibits glycolysis, which can throw off blood sugar measurements. Citrate/fluoride/EDTA tubes work better in this regard.

==Dental considerations for long-term users==
Dental practitioners play an important role in the early detection of anticoagulant overdose through oral manifestations, as the patient does not show any symptoms. Dental treatment of patients taking anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication raises safety concerns in terms of the potential risk of bleeding complications following invasive dental procedures. Therefore, certain guidelines for the dental care of patients taking these drugs are needed.

Detecting overdose

An overdose of anticoagulants usually occurs in people who have heart problems and need to take anticoagulants in the long term to reduce the risk of stroke from their high blood pressure.

An International Normalised Ratio (INR) test would be recommended to confirm the overdose so that the dosage can be adjusted to an acceptable standard. The INR test measures the time it takes for a clot to form in a blood sample relative to a standard.

An INR value of 1 indicates a level of coagulation equivalent to that of an average patient not taking warfarin, and values greater than 1 indicate a longer clotting time and, thus, a longer bleeding time.

Assessing bleeding risk

There are two main parts to the assessment of bleeding risk:
* Assessment of the likely risk of bleeding associated with the required dental procedure
* Assessment of the patient&#x27;s individual-level bleeding risk

Managing bleeding risk

A patient who is on anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications may undergo dental treatments which are unlikely to cause bleeding, such as local anesthesia injection, basic gum charting, removal of plaque, calculus and stain above the gum level, direct or indirect fillings which are above the gingiva, root canal treatment, taking impression for denture or crown and fitting or adjustment of orthodontic appliances.  For all these procedures, it is recommended that the dentist treat the patient following the normal standard procedure and taking care to avoid any bleeding.

For a patient who needs to undergo dental treatments which are more likely to cause bleeding, such as simple tooth extractions (1-3 teeth with small wound size), drainage of swelling inside the mouth, periodontal charting, root planing,  direct or indirect filling which extends below the gingiva, complex filling, flap raising procedure, gingival recontouring and biopsies, the dentist needs to take extra precautions apart from the standard procedure. The recommendations are as follows:
* if the patient has another medical condition or is taking other medication that may increase bleeding risk, consult the patient&#x27;s general medical practitioner or specialist
* if the patient is on a short course of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, delay the non-urgent, invasive procedure until the medication has been discontinued
* plan treatment for early in the day and week, where possible, to allow time for the management of prolonged bleeding or re-bleeding if it occurs
* perform the procedure as traumatically as possible, use appropriate local measures and only discharge the patient once hemostasis has been confirmed
* if travel time to emergency care is a concern, place particular emphasis at the time of the initial treatment on the use of measures to avoid complications
* advise the patient to take paracetamol, unless contraindicated, for pain relief rather than NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac or naproxen
* provide the patient with written post-treatment advice and emergency contact details
* follow the specific recommendations and advice given for the management of patients taking different anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs

There is general agreement that in most cases, treatment regimens with older anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) and antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, ticagrelor, and/or aspirin) should not be altered before dental procedures. The risks of stopping or reducing these medication regimens (i.e., thromboembolism, stroke, myocardial infarction) far outweigh the consequences of prolonged bleeding, which can be controlled with local measures. In patients with other existing medical conditions that can increase the risk of prolonged bleeding after dental treatment or receiving other therapy that can increase bleeding risk, dental practitioners may wish to consult the patient&#x27;s physician to determine whether care can safely be delivered in a primary care office. Any suggested modification to the medication regimen before dental surgery should be done in consultation and on the advice of the patient&#x27;s physician.

Based on limited evidence, the consensus appears to be that in most patients who are receiving the newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (i.e., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) and undergoing dental treatment (in conjunction with usual local measures to control bleeding), no change to the anticoagulant regimen is required. In patients deemed to be at higher risk of bleeding (e.g., patients with other medical conditions or undergoing more extensive procedures associated with higher bleeding risk), consideration may be given, in consultation with and on advice of the patient&#x27;s physician, to postponing the timing of the daily dose of the anticoagulant until after the procedure; timing the dental intervention as late as possible after last dose of anticoagulant; or temporarily interrupting drug therapy for 24 to 48 hours.

==Research==
A substantial number of compounds are being investigated for use as anticoagulants. The most promising ones act on the contact activation system (factor XIIa and factor XIa); it is anticipated that this may provide agents that prevent thrombosis without conferring a risk of bleeding.

, the direct factor XIa inhibitor milvexian is in Phase II clinical trials for the prevention of an embolism after surgery.

=== Utilization ===
Research has been conducted on changes in anticoagulant drug supply for hospitals in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2018-2022. According to researchers, &quot;there was a 43.4% decline in the total volume of anticoagulants and antiplatelets at US hospitals in March 2020, driven by a decrease in heparin volume.&quot; Furthermore, it has been found that &quot;Therapeutic AC [Anticoagulation] use declined from 32% in 2020 to 12% in 2022, especially after December 2021&quot; and the introduction of the Omicron variant.

<text>The Quiet Earth is a 1981 science fiction novel by New Zealand writer Craig Harrison. The novel was adapted into a 1985 New Zealand science fiction film of the same name directed by Geoff Murphy.

The 2013 Penguin edition includes an introduction by Bernard Beckett.

==Plot summary==

===Alone===
John Hobson, a geneticist involved in a project concerned with manipulating DNA, awakes in his hotel room in Thames, New Zealand, after a nightmare of falling from a great height. His wristwatch has stopped at 6:12. Upon getting up he finds the electricity off. It is quiet outside, with nobody in sight. Hobson checks the time in his car, finding the vehicle&#x27;s clock is also frozen at 6:12. This perplexes him, as the vehicle&#x27;s clock runs ahead of his wristwatch by several minutes. 

The town&#x27;s shops are locked and unattended, with no sign of people. Investigating a car sitting at an intersection, Hobson sees that the driver&#x27;s seatbelt is still fastened. Telephones are dead and there is only static on the radio. All humans and animals have disappeared. No watch or clock shows anything later than 6:12.

Hobson concludes that some force has altered the clocks to show the same time and then stopped them, suggesting an intelligence behind the event, which Hobson dubs &quot;the Effect&quot;.

A garden yields the first sign of life Hobson has found – a worm dug up from the soil. The garden is otherwise devoid of fauna. Hobson wonders if he has gone mad, but dismisses the idea.

During the night, Hobson hears sounds from outside approaching. Hobson wills the entity to leave, and the sounds retreat. Uncertainty as to whether the presence was there, or whether it may have been a stray animal spared from the Effect competes in his mind with speculations that the intruder could be a manifestation of the Effect. Hobson reassures himself that he can keep the entity at bay with mental effort.

The next morning Hobson procures weapons and supplies, and leaves for Auckland, finding the city deserted. Hobson seems to be the only human being remaining. He wonders what rendered him immune to the Effect. Hobson hurries to an apparent smoke signal coming from the North Shore, only to find suburban homes destroyed by the impact of a jetliner. The plane was empty when it crashed.

Hobson travels to the research unit, where he worked to reactivate dormant genes in humans and animals using high-frequency sound waves and radiation. The unit&#x27;s head, Perrin, believed that awakening the dormant genes would lead to a quantum leap in evolution. Hobson finds Perrin in a radiation chamber, dead at the controls of the sound wave machine. The machine appears to have short-circuited, but there is no evidence indicating how Perrin died. Hobson decides he perished before the Effect – as dead animal tissue did not vanish. Hobson retrieves Perrin&#x27;s papers, then begins journeying to Wellington, hoping to find survivors or clues as to what happened.

En route to Rotorua, Hobson sees a creature in his headlights. The monster is some kind of hybrid of dog and calf. Hobson drives off terror-stricken, unsure as to whether the apparition was really there.

At Rotorua, after realising everyone else is dead, Hobson almost commits suicide. When he comes across live fish in a stream, Hobson concludes that the Effect did not penetrate water. He is startled when an electronic howling noise booms out across Lake Taupō from the far side. Hobson reaches an area of bushland near Tūrangi, his path blocked by a truck. Back-tracking, he finds the alternate route also cut off. Trying to work around the stalled vehicle, he is confronted by another survivor with a rifle.

===Api===
The gunman is Apirana Maketu, a Māori and a lance-corporal in the New Zealand Army. &quot;Api&quot; woke up at his barracks in Waiouru to find the base deserted. He remained at his post for two days before setting out to find survivors.

A search of Gisborne and the East Coast yielded nothing, and a visit to the power station at Tokaanu led him to believe the electrical grid was knocked out by a massive surge. Api heard the same sound that Hobson heard – albeit earlier in the day and coming from the side of the lake that Hobson was standing on. Believing it to be a car, Api laid the roadblock to catch anyone coming south.

Api reveals his belief that something hostile is loose in the land. It is present only in certain places, and is stronger at night. The soldier is both relieved and worried to find that Hobson has experienced the same dread.

The two men seem to already know one other, sharing a flash of recognition upon first meeting. Neither can account for this, as they have never encountered each other before.

They speculate about the possibility of other survivors. Api posits that those underground in mines and underwater in submarines might have survived. Hobson recalls the worm, but notes a complete lack of rats, surmising that only animal life below a certain size has escaped the Effect underground. He concedes the possibility of submarine survivors. 

They arrive at the nation&#x27;s capital to find it devoid of life. Api and Hobson set up dwellings in a hotel and hunt for survivors. Hobson plans to run tests to see if he can determine the nature of the Effect and the reason why he and Api survived.

Api assists Hobson with procuring equipment for the scientist&#x27;s studies. A radio transceiver is set up, and the duo transmit words and Morse code across the world. They receive no response. Hobson&#x27;s investigations reveal no reason for their exemption from the Effect. The men face the prospect that they are alone.

Api goes skin-diving for shellfish – he pretends to drown as a joke, and Hobson reacts unconsciously by holding the other man&#x27;s head underwater. There is a moment of hostility when Api breaks free, resolved when Hobson explains that his son, who was autistic, drowned in a bathtub, and Hobson felt Api was making fun of this. The death of the child led to the end of Hobson&#x27;s marriage. Both men realise that Hobson is not in complete control of his actions.

Visiting the Beehive, Api speculates that they could be lab rats on some kind of duplicate Earth; it is they who disappeared. Hobson puts no stock in this theory.

Three weeks after the Effect, Hobson is left alone while Api goes to get a new car. Hobson goes into Api&#x27;s bedroom and finds photographs of Api as a private during the Vietnam War, posing with the mutilated corpses of Viet Cong. Hobson believes that Api is a psychopath.

===The End Is the Beginning===
Hobson feels helpless to prevent his relationship with Api from deteriorating further and plans to kill Api with sleeping pills.

After searching for a boat to take them to the South Island, during which both men experience an attack of dread from the &quot;force&quot; hounding them, Api takes Hobson for a joyride in his Lotus Elite.

A woman runs into the car&#x27;s path. She is taken to the hotel and made comfortable, but neither Api nor Hobson are medically trained. Unless she is less badly hurt than she seems, she will die.

The men bicker pointlessly. The woman&#x27;s condition worsens, and there is nothing her fellow survivors can do for her. Hobson senses the unseen force again, emanating from the empty city. He speculates that the force may have always been a part of the land, and is claiming the Earth.

Api studies the Bible, and later wakes Hobson to tell him that he has solved the clock enigma. 6:12 relates to the Number of the Beast, 666 (6–12 = 6 and 6 plus 6) and to Revelation 6:12, with the Biblical chapter&#x27;s talk of men hiding from the face of God. Hobson does not believe this, and holds a hidden gun on the deranged soldier. The woman dies, sending Api into hysterics.

After another argument, a full-scale battle with guns and grenades ensues. Hobson kills Api, with the soldier seeming to give up. The scientist is now alone.

Breaking open Perrin&#x27;s box, Hobson realises his colleagues considered him unbalanced and kept him under surveillance. Perrin believed that Hobson&#x27;s DNA was altered due to radiation, which caused his child&#x27;s autism. Hobson believes the Effect was his doing. The project he worked on caused the unravelling of animal DNA; only those with the dormant gene pair were spared.

Flashbacks detail Hobson&#x27;s last days at the research unit. Perrin seizes upon an accident with the sound wave/radiation machine in which Hobson set the sound modulator too high and was blasted out of his chair by an invisible energy wave. Perrin charges Hobson with negligence, as the sample slides for insects and animals in the machine are blank, while the ones for plants are normal. This event cements for Hobson his long-growing misgivings about the experiments, and what he believes are Perrin&#x27;s motives for pursuing them.

In a later flashback, Hobson relates how he sabotaged the sound wave machine before going on leave to output a much higher level of infrasound than the controls would register. The idea was to put the machine out of action temporarily, ruining Perrin&#x27;s chance to use Hobson&#x27;s theories. Hobson took what he believed to be a fatal dose of sleeping pills on the night before the Effect.

As he reads Perrin&#x27;s notes, Hobson realises that this sabotage almost certainly caused the Effect. His act always had a different purpose – to kill Perrin. Believing his boss insane and consumed with a desire to play God, Hobson subconsciously altered his own memory to hide this fact from himself.

This ability to edit his own recollections, and to take refuge in a kind of mental &quot;super-reality&quot;, is purely automatic. Hobson finally accepts the guilt for letting his son drown. Allowing his child to die was his way of destroying himself, a kind of external suicide. The child&#x27;s autism mirrored his father&#x27;s own emptiness. Perhaps Hobson caused the Effect, or is dreaming all this in a barbiturate coma, or is in Hell or Purgatory. Perhaps the rest of humanity evolved, or is unchanged and wondering where Hobson and a handful of others have gone to. With the death of the entire race on his hands, Hobson jumps from the hotel. He gathers speed, then wakes up in his motel room in Thames. Recovering from the nightmare of falling, all he can remember of the dream he was ripped from, he notices that his wrist watch has stopped at 6:12.

<text>ATP synthase is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the energy storage molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). ATP synthase is a molecular machine. The overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase is:
* ADP + Pi + 2H+out ATP + H2O + 2H+in

ATP synthase lies across a cellular membrane and forms an aperture that protons can cross from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, imparting energy for the synthesis of ATP. This electrochemical gradient is generated by the electron transport chain and allows cells to store energy in ATP for later use. In prokaryotic cells ATP synthase lies across the plasma membrane, while in eukaryotic cells it lies across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Organisms capable of photosynthesis also have ATP synthase across the thylakoid membrane, which in plants is located in the chloroplast and in cyanobacteria is located in the cytoplasm.

Eukaryotic ATP synthases are F-ATPases (which usually work as ATP synthases instead of ATPases in cellular environments) and running &quot;in reverse&quot; for an ATPase (ATPase catalyze the decomposition of ATP into ADP and a free phosphate ion). This article deals mainly with this type. An F-ATPase consists of two main subunits, FO and F1, which has a rotational motor mechanism allowing for ATP production.

== Nomenclature ==
The F1 fraction derives its name from the term &quot;Fraction 1&quot; and FO (written as a subscript letter &quot;o&quot;, not &quot;zero&quot;) derives its name from being the binding fraction for oligomycin, a type of naturally derived antibiotic that is able to inhibit the FO unit of ATP synthase. These functional regions consist of different protein subunits — refer to tables. This enzyme is used in synthesis of ATP through aerobic respiration.

== Structure and function ==


Located within the thylakoid membrane and the inner mitochondrial membrane, ATP synthase consists of two regions FO and F1. FO causes rotation of F1 and is made of c-ring and subunits a, two b, F6. F1 is made of α, β, γ, and δ subunits. F1 has a water-soluble part that can hydrolyze ATP. FO on the other hand has mainly hydrophobic regions. FO F1 creates a pathway for protons movement across the membrane.

=== F1 region ===
The F1 portion of ATP synthase is hydrophilic and responsible for hydrolyzing ATP. The F1 unit protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix space. Subunits α and β make a hexamer with 6 binding sites. Three of them are catalytically inactive and they bind ADP.

Three other subunits catalyze the ATP synthesis. The other F1 subunits γ, δ, and ε are a part of a rotational motor mechanism (rotor/axle). The γ subunit allows β to go through conformational changes (i.e., closed, half open, and open states) that allow for ATP to be bound and released once synthesized. The F1 particle is large and can be seen in the transmission electron microscope by negative staining. These are particles of 9 nm diameter that pepper the inner mitochondrial membrane.

=== FO region ===
FO is a water insoluble protein with eight subunits and a transmembrane ring. The ring has a tetrameric shape with a helix-loop-helix protein that goes through conformational changes when protonated and deprotonated, pushing neighboring subunits to rotate, causing the spinning of FO which then also affects conformation of F1, resulting in switching of states of alpha and beta subunits. The FO region of ATP synthase is a proton pore that is embedded in the mitochondrial membrane. It consists of three main subunits, a, b, and c. Six c subunits make up the rotor ring, and subunit b makes up a stalk connecting to F1 OSCP that prevents the αβ hexamer from rotating. Subunit a connects b to the c ring. Humans have six additional subunits, d, e, f, g, F6, and 8 (or A6L). This part of the enzyme is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and couples proton translocation to the rotation that causes ATP synthesis in the F1 region.

In eukaryotes, mitochondrial FO forms membrane-bending dimers. These dimers self-arrange into long rows at the end of the cristae, possibly the first step of cristae formation. An atomic model for the dimeric yeast FO region was determined by cryo-EM at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å.
== Binding model ==
In the 1960s through the 1970s, Paul Boyer, a UCLA Professor, developed the binding change, or flip-flop, mechanism theory, which postulated that ATP synthesis is dependent on a conformational change in ATP synthase generated by rotation of the gamma subunit. The research group of John E. Walker, then at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, crystallized the F1 catalytic-domain of ATP synthase. The structure, at the time the largest asymmetric protein structure known, indicated that Boyer&#x27;s rotary-catalysis model was, in essence, correct. For elucidating this, Boyer and Walker shared half of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

The crystal structure of the F1 showed alternating alpha and beta subunits (3 of each), arranged like segments of an orange around a rotating asymmetrical gamma subunit. According to the current model of ATP synthesis (known as the alternating catalytic model), the transmembrane potential created by (H+) proton cations supplied by the electron transport chain, drives the (H+) proton cations from the intermembrane space through the membrane via the FO region of ATP synthase. A portion of the FO (the ring of c-subunits) rotates as the protons pass through the membrane. The c-ring is tightly attached to the asymmetric central stalk (consisting primarily of the gamma subunit), causing it to rotate within the alpha3beta3 of F1 causing the 3 catalytic nucleotide binding sites to go through a series of conformational changes that lead to ATP synthesis. The major F1 subunits are prevented from rotating in sympathy with the central stalk rotor by a peripheral stalk that joins the alpha3beta3 to the non-rotating portion of FO. The structure of the intact ATP synthase is currently known at low-resolution from electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of the complex. The cryo-EM model of ATP synthase suggests that the peripheral stalk is a flexible structure that wraps around the complex as it joins F1 to FO. Under the right conditions, the enzyme reaction can also be carried out in reverse, with ATP hydrolysis driving proton pumping across the membrane.

The binding change mechanism involves the active site of a β subunit&#x27;s cycling between three states. In the &quot;loose&quot; state, ADP and phosphate enter the active site; in the adjacent diagram, this is shown in pink. The enzyme then undergoes a change in shape and forces these molecules together, with the active site in the resulting &quot;tight&quot; state (shown in red) binding the newly produced ATP molecule with very high affinity. Finally, the active site cycles back to the open state (orange), releasing ATP and binding more ADP and phosphate, ready for the next cycle of ATP production.

== Physiological role ==

Like other enzymes, the activity of F1FO ATP synthase is reversible. Large-enough quantities of ATP cause it to create a transmembrane proton gradient, this is used by fermenting bacteria that do not have an electron transport chain, but rather hydrolyze ATP to make a proton gradient, which they use to drive flagella and the transport of nutrients into the cell.

In respiring bacteria under physiological conditions, ATP synthase, in general, runs in the opposite direction, creating ATP while using the proton motive force created by the electron transport chain as a source of energy. The overall process of creating energy in this fashion is termed oxidative phosphorylation.
The same process takes place in the mitochondria, where ATP synthase is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the F1-part projects into the mitochondrial matrix. By pumping proton cations into the matrix, the ATP-synthase converts ADP into ATP.

== Evolution ==
The evolution of ATP synthase is thought to have been modular whereby two functionally independent subunits became associated and gained new functionality. This association appears to have occurred early in evolutionary history, because essentially the same structure and activity of ATP synthase enzymes are present in all kingdoms of life. The F-ATP synthase displays high functional and mechanistic similarity to the V-ATPase. However, whereas the F-ATP synthase generates ATP by utilising a proton gradient, the V-ATPase generates a proton gradient at the expense of ATP, generating pH values of as low as 1.
The F1 region also shows significant similarity to hexameric DNA helicases (especially the Rho factor), and the entire enzyme region shows some similarity to -powered T3SS or flagellar motor complexes. The α3β3 hexamer of the F1 region shows significant structural similarity to hexameric DNA helicases; both form a ring with 3-fold rotational symmetry with a central pore. Both have roles dependent on the relative rotation of a macromolecule within the pore; the DNA helicases use the helical shape of DNA to drive their motion along the DNA molecule and to detect supercoiling, whereas the α3β3 hexamer uses the conformational changes through the rotation of the γ subunit to drive an enzymatic reaction.

The motor of the FO particle shows great functional similarity to the motors that drive flagella. Both feature a ring of many small alpha-helical proteins that rotate relative to nearby stationary proteins, using a potential gradient as an energy source. This link is tenuous, however, as the overall structure of flagellar motors is far more complex than that of the FO particle and the ring with about 30 rotating proteins is far larger than the 10, 11, or 14 helical proteins in the FO complex. More recent structural data do however show that the ring and the stalk are structurally similar to the F1 particle.
The modular evolution theory for the origin of ATP synthase suggests that two subunits with independent function, a DNA helicase with ATPase activity and a motor, were able to bind, and the rotation of the motor drove the ATPase activity of the helicase in reverse. This complex then evolved greater efficiency and eventually developed into today&#x27;s intricate ATP synthases. Alternatively, the DNA helicase/ motor complex may have had pump activity with the ATPase activity of the helicase driving the motor in reverse. This may have evolved to carry out the reverse reaction and act as an ATP synthase.

==Inhibitors==
A variety of natural and synthetic inhibitors of ATP synthase have been discovered. These have been used to probe the structure and mechanism of ATP synthase. Some may be of therapeutic use. There are several classes of ATP synthase inhibitors, including peptide inhibitors, polyphenolic phytochemicals, polyketides, organotin compounds, polyenic α-pyrone derivatives, cationic inhibitors, substrate analogs, amino acid modifiers, and other miscellaneous chemicals. Some of the most commonly used ATP synthase inhibitors are oligomycin and DCCD.

== In different organisms ==
=== Bacteria ===
&quot;&quot; ATP synthase is the simplest known form of ATP synthase, with 8 different subunit types.

Bacterial F-ATPases can occasionally operate in reverse, turning them into an ATPase. Some bacteria have no F-ATPase, using an A/V-type ATPase bidirectionally.

=== Yeast ===
Yeast ATP synthase is one of the best-studied eukaryotic ATP synthases; and five F1, eight FO subunits, and seven associated proteins have been identified. Most of these proteins have homologues in other eukaryotes.

=== Plant ===
In plants, ATP synthase is also present in chloroplasts (CF1FO-ATP synthase). The enzyme is integrated into thylakoid membrane; the CF1-part sticks into stroma, where dark reactions of photosynthesis (also called the light-independent reactions or the Calvin cycle) and ATP synthesis take place. The overall structure and the catalytic mechanism of the chloroplast ATP synthase are almost the same as those of the bacterial enzyme. However, in chloroplasts, the proton motive force is generated not by respiratory electron transport chain but by primary photosynthetic proteins. The synthase has a 40-aa insert in the gamma-subunit to inhibit wasteful activity when dark.

=== Mammal ===
The ATP synthase isolated from bovine (&quot;Bos taurus&quot;) heart mitochondria is, in terms of biochemistry and structure, the best-characterized ATP synthase. Beef heart is used as a source for the enzyme because of the high concentration of mitochondria in cardiac muscle. Their genes have close homology to human ATP synthases.

Human genes that encode components of ATP synthases:
* &quot;ATP5A1&quot;
* &quot;ATP5B&quot;
* &quot;ATP5C1&quot;, &quot;ATP5D&quot;, &quot;ATP5E&quot;, &quot;ATP5F1&quot;, &quot;ATP5MC1&quot;, &quot;ATP5G2&quot;, &quot;ATP5G3&quot;, &quot;ATP5H&quot;, &quot;ATP5I&quot;, &quot;ATP5J&quot;, &quot;ATP5J2&quot;, &quot;ATP5L&quot;, &quot;ATP5O&quot;
* &quot;MT-ATP6&quot;, &quot;MT-ATP8&quot;

=== Other eukaryotes ===
Eukaryotes belonging to some divergent lineages have very special organizations of the ATP synthase. A euglenozoa ATP synthase forms a dimer with a boomerang-shaped F1 head like other mitochondrial ATP synthases, but the FO subcomplex has many unique subunits. It uses cardiolipin. The inhibitory IF1 also binds differently, in a way shared with trypanosomatida.

=== Archaea ===
Archaea do not generally have an F-ATPase. Instead, they synthesize ATP using the A-ATPase/synthase, a rotary machine structurally similar to the V-ATPase but mainly functioning as an ATP synthase. Like the bacteria F-ATPase, it is believed to also function as an ATPase.

=== LUCA and earlier ===

F-ATPase gene linkage and gene order are widely conserved across ancient prokaryote lineages, implying that this system already existed at a date before the last universal common ancestor, the LUCA.

<text>Johannes Theodorus &quot;Jan&quot; Toorop (20 December 1858 – 3 March 1928) was a Dutch painter who worked in various styles, including Symbolism, Art Nouveau, and Pointillism. His early work was influenced by the Amsterdam Impressionism movement.

==Biography==

Johannes Theodorus Toorop was born on 20 December 1858 in Purworejo on the island of Java in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia). His father was Christoffel Theodorus Toorop, a civil servant, and his mother was Maria Magdalena Cooke. He was the third of five children and lived on the island of Bangka near Sumatra until he was nine years old. He was then sent to school in Batavia on Java.

In 1869 he left Indonesia for the Netherlands, where he studied in Delft and Amsterdam. In 1880 he became a student at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. He met the Belgian painter William Degouve de Nuncques in 1883 and the two shared a studio for a time and developed a strong friendship. From 1882 to 1886 he lived in Brussels where he joined the artist association L&#x27;Essor, which had as its original aim to rebel against the conservative tendencies of the art institutions and circles in Brussels. Later he joined in Brussels Les XX (Les Vingts), a group of artists centred on James Ensor. Toorop worked in various styles during these years, such as Realism, Impressionism Neo-Impressionism and Post-Impressionism.

After his marriage to Annie Hall, a British woman, in 1886, Toorop alternated his time between The Hague, England and Brussels, and after 1890 also the Dutch seaside town of Katwijk aan Zee. During this period he developed his unique Symbolist style, with dynamic, unpredictable lines based on Javanese motifs, highly stylised willowy figures, and curvilinear designs.

In the late 19th century (in 1897) Toorop lived for 20 years in a small house on the market in the seaside town Domburg, Walcheren, Zeeland. He worked with a group of fellow artists, including Marinus Zwart and Piet Mondrian. There was no joint endeavor or common style among them. Each followed his individual personality, but they sought their inspiration in &quot;the Zeeland Light&quot;, in the dunes, forests, beaches and the characteristic Zeeland population. Toorop was the center of this group.

His 1900 novel portrait of his friend Marie Jeanette de Lange was made whilst she was not wearing fashionable (restrictive) clothing and it was in the style of Pointillism.

Thereafter he turned to Art Nouveau styles, in which a similar play of lines is used for decorative purposes, without any apparent symbolic meaning. In 1905, he converted to Catholicism and began producing religious works. He also created book illustrations, posters, and stained glass designs.

Throughout his life Toorop also produced portraits, in sketch format and as paintings, which range in style from highly realistic to impressionistic.

Toorop died on 3 March 1928 in The Hague. His daughter Charley Toorop (1891–1955) was also a painter, as was his grandson Edgar Fernhout.

<text>The 1934 British Empire Games were the second edition of what is now known as the Commonwealth Games, held in England, from 4–11 August 1934. The host city was London, with the main venue at Wembley Park, although the track cycling events were in Manchester. Seventeen national teams took part, including the Irish Free State (the only Games in which they participated, although an all-Ireland team competed at the 1930 Games).

The 1934 Games had been originally awarded to Johannesburg, South Africa, but the change of venue to London was made due to concerns regarding the treatment of black and Asian athletes by South African officials and fans.

Six sports were featured in the Games: athletics in White City Stadium; boxing, wrestling, and aquatics (swimming and diving) in the Empire Pool and Arena, Wembley; cycling in Fallowfield Stadium, Manchester; and lawn bowls at Paddington and Temple. Events for women athletes included a debut in athletics; the previous games had women&#x27;s events only in swimming and diving.

<text>A ski area is the terrain and supporting infrastructure where skiing and other snow sports take place. Such sports include alpine and cross-country skiing, snow boarding, tubing, sledding, etc. Ski areas may stand alone or be part of a ski resort.

== Scope of activities ==
The US Forest Service defines a ski area as: &quot;a site and associated facilities that has been primarily developed for alpine or Nordic skiing and other snow sports, but may also include, in appropriate circumstances, facilities necessary for other seasonal or year-round natural resource-based recreation activities, provided that a preponderance of revenue generated by the ski area derives from the sale of alpine and Nordic ski area passes and lift tickets, revenue from alpine, Nordic, and other snow sport instruction, and gross revenue from ancillary facilities that support alpine or Nordic skiing and other snow sports.&quot;

== Notable examples ==

Ski areas can extend over several municipalities (ex: La Plagne in France, Alta Badia in Italy, etc.) or several countries (ex: Portes du Soleil in France and Switzerland). A municipality can have several ski areas (ex: Chamonix-Mont-Blanc in France, Davos in Switzerland, Kitzbühel in Austria, etc.). The largest ski areas connect several ski resorts (ex: Les Trois Vallées in France).
== Business models ==
Alpine ski areas require substantial capital investment, a significant labor force, and maintenance of an infrastructure that provides dining and retail services to skiers and that assures reliable snow that is appealing to skiers in locations that are accessible to them. Consequently, they require a fee structure and ancillary attractions that provide the revenue to sustain them economically. The natural settings of ski areas require the management of their environmental impacts, according to legal standards. The profession of ski area management requires specialized training in degree programs. Specialities include the maintenance of the lift and trail infrastructure and the management of the supporting commercial enterprises that rent and sell skis and that provide food services.

<doc id="178235" wikidata="Q845304" url="?curid=178235" title="Large Binocular Telescope">
<text>The Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) is an optical telescope for astronomy located on Mount Graham, in the Pinaleno Mountains of southeastern Arizona, United States. It is a part of the Mount Graham International Observatory.

When using both 8.4 m (330 inch) wide mirrors, with centres 14.4 m apart, the LBT has the same light-gathering ability as an 11.8 m (464 inch) wide single circular telescope and the resolution of a 22.8 m (897 inch) wide one.

The LBT mirrors individually are the joint second-largest optical telescope in continental North America, next to the Hobby–Eberly Telescope in West Texas. It has the largest monolithic, or in an optical telescope.

Strehl ratios of 60–90% in the infrared H band and 95% in the infrared M band have been achieved by the LBT.

== Project ==
The LBT was originally named the &quot;Columbus Project&quot;. It is a joint project of these members: the Italian astronomical community represented by the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, the University of Arizona, University of Minnesota, University of Notre Dame, University of Virginia, the LBT Beteiligungsgesellschaft in Germany (Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Landessternwarte in Heidelberg, Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP), Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Munich and Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn); Ohio State University; and the Research Corporation for Science Advancement based in Tucson, Arizona, USA. The cost was around 100 million Euro.

The telescope design has two 8.4 m (330 inch) mirrors mounted on a common base, hence the name &quot;binocular&quot;. LBT takes advantage of active and adaptive optics, provided by Arcetri Observatory. The collecting area is two 8.4 meter aperture mirrors, which works out to about 111 m2 combined. This area is equivalent to an circular aperture, which would be greater than any other single telescope, but it is not comparable in many respects since the light is collected at a lower diffraction limit and is not combined in the same way. Also, an interferometric mode will be available, with a maximum baseline of for aperture synthesis imaging observations and a baseline of for nulling interferometry. This feature is along one axis with the LBTI instrument at wavelengths of 2.9–13 micrometres, which is the near infrared.

The telescope was designed by a group of Italian firms, and assembled by Ansaldo in its Milanese plant.

=== Mountain controversy ===
The choice of location sparked considerable local controversy, both from the San Carlos Apache Tribe, who view the mountain as sacred, and from environmentalists who contended that the observatory would cause the demise of an endangered subspecies of the American red squirrel, the Mount Graham red squirrel. Environmentalists and members of the tribe filed some forty lawsuits – eight of which went before a federal appeals court – but the project ultimately prevailed after an act of the United States Congress.

The telescope and mountain observatory survived two major forest fires in thirteen years, the more recent in the summer of 2017. Likewise the squirrels continue to survive. Some experts now believe their numbers fluctuate dependent upon nut harvest without regard to the observatory.

== First light ==

The telescope was dedicated in October 2004 and saw first light with a single primary mirror on October 12, 2005, which viewed NGC 891. The second primary mirror was installed in January 2006 and became fully operational in January 2008. The first light with the second primary mirror was on September 18, 2006, and for the first and second together it was on January 11–12, 2008.

The first binocular light images show three false-color renditions of the spiral galaxy NGC 2770. The galaxy is 88 million light years from the Milky Way galaxy, a relatively close neighbor. The galaxy has a flat disk of stars and glowing gas tipped slightly toward Earth&#x27;s line of sight.

The first image taken combined ultraviolet and green light, and emphasizes the clumpy regions of newly formed hot stars in the spiral arms. The second image combined two deep red colors to highlight the smoother distribution of older, cooler stars. The third image was a composite of ultraviolet, green and deep red light and shows the detailed structure of hot, moderate and cool stars in the galaxy. The cameras and images were produced by the Large Binocular Camera team, led by Emanuele Giallongo at the Rome Astrophysical Observatory.

In binocular aperture synthesis mode LBT has a light-collecting area of 111 m2, equivalent to a single primary mirror in diameter, and will combine light to produce the image sharpness equivalent to a single telescope. However, this requires a beam combiner that was tested in 2008, but has not been a part of regular operations. It can take images with one side at 8.4 m aperture, or take two images of the same object using different instruments on each side of the telescope.

==Adaptive optics==

In the summer of 2010, the &quot;First Light Adaptive Optics&quot; (FLAO) – an adaptive optics system with a deformable secondary mirror rather than correcting atmospheric distortion further downstream in the optics – was inaugurated. Using one 8.4 m side, it surpassed Hubble sharpness (at certain light wavelengths), achieving a Strehl ratio of 60–80% rather than the 20–30% of older adaptive optic systems, or the 1% typically achieved without adaptive optics for telescopes of this size. Adaptive optics at a telescope&#x27;s secondary (M2) was previously tested at MMT Observatory by the Arcetri Observatory and University of Arizona team.

== In the media ==
The telescope has made appearances on an episode of the Discovery Channel TV show &quot;Really Big Things&quot;, National Geographic Channel &quot;Big, Bigger, Biggest&quot;, and the BBC program &quot;The Sky At Night&quot;. The BBC Radio 4 radio documentary &quot;The New Galileos&quot; covered the LBT and the James Webb Space Telescope.

==Discoveries and observations==
LBT, with the XMM-Newton, was used to discover the galaxy cluster 2XMM J083026+524133 in 2008, over 7 billion light years away from Earth. In 2007 the LBT detected a 26th magnitude afterglow from the gamma ray burst GRB 070125.

In 2017, LBT observed the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, an uncrewed asteroid sample return spacecraft, in space while it was en route.

==Instruments==
Some current or planned LBT telescope instruments:
* LBC – optical and near ultraviolet wide field prime focus cameras. One is optimized for the blue part of the optical spectrum and one for the red. (Both cameras operational)
* PEPSI – A high resolution and very high-resolution optical spectrograph and imaging polarimeter at the combined focus. (In development)
* MODS – two optical multi object and longslit spectrographs plus imagers. Capable of running in a single mirror or binocular mode. (MODS1 operational – MODS2 in integration on the mountain)
* LUCI – two multi-object and longslit infrared spectrographs plus imagers, one for each side (associated with one of the 8m mirrors) of the telescope. The imager has 2 cameras and can observe in both seeing-limited and diffraction-limited (with adaptive optics) modes. End of commissioning and hand over to the LBTO was in 2018.
* LINC/Nirvana – wide-field interferometric imaging with adaptive optics at the combined focus (in commissioning).
* LBTI/LMIRCAM – 2.9 to 5.2 micron Fizeau imaging and medium resolution grism spectroscopy at the combined focus.
* LBTI/NOMIC – N band nulling imager for the study of protoplanetary and debris disks at the combined focus. (In commissioning phase – first stabilization of the fringes in December 2013)
* FLAO – first light adaptive optics to correct atmospheric distortion
* ARGOS – multiple laser guide star unit capable of supporting ground layer or multi conjugate adaptive optics. End of commissioning and handover to LBTO was in 2018.

===LUCI===
LUCI (originally LUCIFER: Large Binocular Telescope Near-infrared Spectroscopic Utility with Camera and Integral Field Unit for Extragalactic Research) is the near-infrared instrument for the LBT.
 The name of the instrument was changed to LUCI in 2012. LUCI operates in the 0.9–2.5 μm spectral range using a 2048 x 2048 element Hawaii-2RG detector array from Teledyne and provides imaging and spectroscopic capabilities in seeing- and diffraction-limited modes. In its focal plane area, long-slit and multi-slit masks can be installed for single-object and multi-object spectroscopy. A fixed collimator produces an image of the entrance aperture in which either a mirror (for imaging) or a grating can be positioned. Three camera optics with numerical apertures of 1.8, 3.75 and 30 provide image scales of 0.25, 0.12, and 0.015 arcsec/detector element for wide field, seeing-limited and diffraction-limited observations. LUCI is operated at cryogenic temperatures, and is therefore enclosed in a cryostat of 1.6 m diameter and 1.6 m height, and cooled to about −200 °C by two closed-cycle coolers.

<doc id="178236" wikidata="Q7645472" url="?curid=178236" title="Surautomatism">
<text>Surautomatism is any theory or act in practice of surrealist creative production taking, or purporting to take, automatism to its most absurd limits. 

In their 1945 statement &quot;Dialectique de la Dialectique&quot;, Romanian surrealists Gherashim Luca and Dolfi Trost wrote,

:We have returned to the problem of knowledge through images... by establishing a clear distinction between images produced by artistic means and images resulting from rigorously applied scientific procedures, such as the operation of chance or of automatism. We stand opposed to the tendency to reproduce, through symbols, certain valid theoretical contents by the use of pictorial techniques, and believe that the unknown that surrounds us can find a staggering materialization of the highest order in indecipherable images. In generally accepting until now pictorial reproductive means, surrealist painting will find that the way to its blossoming lies in the absurd use of aplastic, objective and entirely non-artistic procedures.

The name surautomatism suggests &quot;going beyond&quot; automatism, but whether surautomatism is anything but a group of methods by which surrealist automatism is practiced is controversial.

Surautomatism includes cubomania, entopic graphomania and various types of what the Romanian surrealists called &quot;indecipherable writing&quot;.

<doc id="178237" wikidata="Q63351" url="?curid=178237" title="Johann Salomo Semler">
<text>Johann Salomo Semler (18 December 1725 – 14 March 1791) was a German church historian, biblical commentator, and critic of ecclesiastical documents and of the history of dogmas. He is sometimes known as &quot;the father of German rationalism&quot;.

==Youth and education==
He was born at Saalfeld in Saxe-Saalfeld, the son of a poor clergyman. He grew up in pietistic surroundings, which powerfully influenced him his life through, though he never became a Pietist. In his seventeenth year he entered the University of Halle, where he became the disciple, afterwards the assistant, and finally the literary executor of the orthodox rationalistic professor S. J. Baumgarten. He also wrote Latin poems. In 1749 he accepted the position of editor, with the title of professor, of the Coburg official &quot;Gazette&quot;. But in 1751 he was invited to the University of Altdorf as professor of philology and history, and in 1752 he became a professor of theology at Halle.

==Early work==
After the death of Baumgarten in 1757, Semler became head of the theological faculty, and the fierce opposition provoked by his writings and lectures only helped increase his fame as a professor. His popularity continued undiminished until 1779. In that year he produced a reply (&quot;Beantwortung der Fragmente eines Ungenannten&quot;) to the Wolfenbuttel Fragments (see Reimarus) and to K. F. Bahrdt&#x27;s confession of faith, a step which was interpreted by the extreme rationalists as a revocation of his own rationalistic position.

==Later work and impact==

===Contemporary perception===
Even the Prussian government, which favoured Bahrdt, made known its displeasure at this new but quite consistent aspect of his position. But, though Semler was not inconsistent with himself in attacking the views of Reimarus and Bahrdt, his popularity began to decline, and towards the end of his life he felt a need to emphasize the apologetic and conservative value of true historical inquiry. His defence of the notorious edict of July 9, 1788, issued by the Prussian minister for ecclesiastical affairs, Johann Christoph von Wöllner, the object of which was to enforce Lutheran orthodoxy, might be cited as a sign of the decline of his powers and of an unfaithfulness to his principles. He died at Halle, Magdeburg, exhausted and disappointed.

===Classification===
The importance of Semler, sometimes called &quot;the father of German rationalism&quot;, in the history of theology and the human mind is that of a critic of biblical and ecclesiastical documents and of the history of dogmas. He was not a philosophical thinker or theologian, though he insisted, with an energy and persistency before unknown, on certain distinctions of great importance when properly worked out and applied, e.g. the distinction between religion and theology, that between private personal beliefs and public historical creeds, and that between the local and temporal and the permanent elements of historical religion. His great work was that of the critic. He was the first to reject the equal value of the Old and New Testaments, the uniform authority of all parts of the Bible, the divine authority of the traditional canon of Scripture, the inspiration and supposed correctness of the text of the Old and New Testaments, and, generally, the identification of revelation with Scripture.

Though to some extent anticipated by the British deist, Thomas Morgan, Semler was the first to take due note of and use for critical purposes the opposition between the Judaic and anti-Judaic parties of the early church. He led the way in the task of discovering the origin of the Gospels, the Epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Apocalypse. He revived previous doubts as to the direct Pauline origin of the Epistle to the Hebrews, called in question Peter&#x27;s authorship of the first epistle, and referred the second epistle to the end of the 2nd century. He wished to remove the Apocalypse altogether from the canon. In textual criticism Semler pursued further the principle of classifying manuscripts in families, adopted by Richard Simon and Johann Albrecht Bengel. In church history Semler did the work of a pioneer in many periods and in several departments. Friedrich Tholuck pronounced him &quot;the father of the history of doctrines,&quot; and Ferdinand Christian Baur &quot;the first to deal with that history from the true critical standpoint.&quot; At the same time, it is admitted by all that he was nowhere more than a pioneer.

His concept of church has been contrasted with Friedrich Schleiermacher&#x27;s.

==Bibliography==
Tholuck gives 171 as the number of Semler&#x27;s works, of which only two reached a second edition. Amongst the major ones are:

*&quot;Commentatio de demoniacis&quot; (Halle, 1760, 4th ed. 1779)
*&quot;Umständliche Untersuchung der damonischen Leute&quot; (1762)

<text>In astronomy, first light is the first use of a telescope (or, in general, a new instrument) to take an astronomical image after it has been constructed. This is often not the first viewing using the telescope; optical tests will probably have been performed to adjust the components.

==Characteristics==
The first light image is normally of little scientific interest and is of poor quality, since the various telescope elements are yet to be adjusted for optimum efficiency. Despite this, a first light is always a moment of great excitement, both for the people who design and build the telescope and for the astronomical community, who may have anticipated the moment for many years while the telescope was under construction. A well-known and spectacular astronomical object is usually chosen as a subject.

==Historical examples==
The famous Hale Telescope of Palomar Observatory saw first light on 26 January 1949, targeting NGC 2261 under the direction of American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble. The image was published in many magazines and is available on Caltech Archives.

The Isaac Newton Telescope had two first lights: one in England in 1965 with its original mirror, and another in 1984 at La Palma island. The second first light was done with a video camera that showed the Crab Pulsar flashing.

Elation at first light images by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 soon gave way to initial disappointment when a flaw prevented adjustments for proper operation. The expected first light image quality was finally achieved after a 1993 servicing mission by Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

The Large Binocular Telescope had its first light with a single primary mirror on 12 October 2005, which was a view of NGC 891. The second primary mirror was installed in January 2006 and became fully operational in January 2008.

The Gran Telescopio Canarias had a first light image of Tycho 1205081 on 14 July 2007.

The IRIS solar space observatory achieved first light on 17 July 2013. The PI noted: &quot;The quality of images and spectra we are receiving from IRIS is amazing. This is just what we were hoping for ...&quot;

On 4 February 2022, the first light viewed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was from the star HD 84406 for the purpose of testing and aligning the focus of the telescope&#x27;s 18 mirrors. On 11 February 2022. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;first light&quot; images from the James Webb Space Telescope were released - as well as a related NASA alignment video (2/11/2022; 3:00). On 6 July 2022, NASA released a test image from the JWST&#x27;s Fine Guidance Sensor. NASA released the first official JWST image on 11 July 2022. Later, in an official ceremony, the first collection of five JWST science images were released on Tuesday, 12 July 2022 (NASA-TV live; 10:30 am/et/usa).&#x27;
