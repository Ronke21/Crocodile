<text>Loretta Lynn (; April 14, 1932 – October 4, 2022) was an American country music singer and songwriter. In a career spanning six decades, Lynn released multiple gold albums. She had numerous hits such as &quot;Hey Loretta&quot;, &quot;The Pill&quot;, &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot;, &quot;Love Is the Foundation&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Lookin&#x27; at Country&quot;, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Woman Enough&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Honky Tonk Girl&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Home A-Drinkin&#x27; (With Lovin&#x27; on Your Mind)&quot;, &quot;One&#x27;s on the Way&quot;, &quot;Fist City&quot;, and &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. The 1980 musical film &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was based on her life.

Lynn received many awards and other accolades for her groundbreaking role in country music, including awards from both the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music (ACM) as a duet partner and an individual artist. She was nominated 18 times for a Grammy Award and won three times. Lynn was the most awarded female country recording artist and the only female ACM Artist of the Decade (the 1970s). Lynn scored 24 1 hit singles and 11 number-one albums. She ended 57 years of touring on the road after she suffered a stroke in 2017 and broke her hip in 2018.

==Early life and career==
Lynn was born Loretta Webb in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, on April 14, 1932. She was the oldest daughter and second child born to Clara Marie &quot;Clary&quot; (&quot;née&quot; Ramey; May 5, 1912 – November 24, 1981) and Melvin Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Webb (June 6, 1906 – February 22, 1959). Ted was a coal miner and subsistence farmer. The family claims Cherokee heritage on Lynn&#x27;s mother&#x27;s side, but have not been officially recognized by that tribe. She was named after the film star Loretta Young. The other Webb children were:

* Melvin &quot;Junior&quot; Webb (December 4, 1929 – July 2, 1993)
* Herman Webb (September 3, 1934 – July 28, 2018)
* Willie &quot;Jay&quot; Lee Webb (February 12, 1937 – July 31, 1996)
* Donald Ray Webb (April 2, 1941 – October 13, 2017)
* Peggy Sue Wright (née Webb; born March 25, 1943)
* Betty Ruth Hopkins (née Webb; born January 5, 1946)
* Crystal Gayle (born Brenda Gail Webb; January 9, 1951)
Loretta&#x27;s father Ted died at the age of 52 from a stroke four years after relocating with her mother and younger siblings to Wabash, Indiana. He had also been battling black lung disease at the time of his death.

Through her matriline, Lynn was distant cousins with country singer Patty Loveless.

==Career==
===1960–1966: Early country success===

Lynn began singing in local clubs in the late 1950s. She later formed her own band, the Trailblazers which included her brother Jay Lee Webb. Lynn won a wristwatch in a televised talent contest in Tacoma, Washington, hosted by Buck Owens. Lynn&#x27;s performance was seen by Canadian Norm Burley of Zero Records, who co-founded the record company after hearing Loretta sing.

Zero Records president, Canadian Don Grashey, arranged a recording session in Hollywood, where four of Lynn&#x27;s compositions were recorded, including &quot;I&#x27;m A Honky Tonk Girl,&quot; &quot;Whispering Sea,&quot; &quot;Heartache Meet Mister Blues,&quot; and &quot;New Rainbow.&quot; Her first release featured &quot;Whispering Sea&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Honky Tonk Girl&quot;. Lynn signed her first contract on February 2, 1960, with Zero. Her album was recorded at United Western Recorders in Hollywood, engineered by Don Blake and produced by Grashey. Musicians who played on the songs were steel guitar player Speedy West, fiddler Harold Hensley, guitarist Roy Lanham, Al Williams on bass, and Muddy Berry on drums. Lynn commented on the different sound of her first record: &quot;Well, there is a West Coast sound that is definitely not the same as the Nashville sound [...] It was a shuffle with a West Coast beat&quot;.

The Lynns toured the country to promote the release to country stations, while Grashey and Del Roy took the music to KFOX in Long Beach, California. When the Lynns reached Nashville, the song was a hit, climbing to No. 14 on Billboard&#x27;s Country and Western chart, and Lynn began cutting demo records for the Wilburn Brothers Publishing Company. Through the Wilburns, she secured a contract with Decca Records. The first Loretta Lynn Fan Club formed in November 1960. By the end of the year, Billboard magazine listed Lynn as the No. 4 Most Promising Country Female Artist.

Lynn&#x27;s relationship with the Wilburn Brothers and her appearances on the Grand Ole Opry, beginning in 1960, helped Lynn become the No. 1 female recording artist in country music. Her contract with the Wilburn Brothers gave them the publishing rights to her material. She unsuccessfully fought the Wilburn Brothers for 30 years to regain the publishing rights to her songs after ending her business relationship with them. Lynn stopped writing music in the 1970s because of the contracts. Lynn joined the Grand Ole Opry on September 25, 1962.

Lynn credited Patsy Cline as her mentor and best friend during her early years in music. In 2010, when interviewed for Jimmy McDonough&#x27;s biography of Tammy Wynette, &quot;Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen&quot;, Lynn said of having best friends in Patsy and Tammy during different times: &quot;Best friends are like husbands. You only need one at a time.&quot;

Lynn released her first Decca single, &quot;Success&quot;, in 1962, and it went straight to No. 6, beginning a string of top 10 singles that would run throughout the 1970s. Lynn&#x27;s music began to regularly hit the Top 10 after 1964 with songs such as &quot;Before I&#x27;m Over You&quot;, which peaked at No.4, followed by &quot;Wine, Women and Song&quot;, which peaked at No.3. In late 1964, she recorded a duet album with Ernest Tubb. Their lead single, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Used to Be&quot;, peaked within the Top 15. The pair recorded two more albums, &quot;Singin&#x27; Again&quot; (1967) and &quot;If We Put Our Heads Together&quot; (1969). In 1965, her solo career continued with three major hits, &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot; (later recorded and made a Top 10 hit in the 1970s by Emmylou Harris), and &quot;The Home You&#x27;re Tearing Down&quot;. Lynn&#x27;s label issued two albums that year, &quot;Songs from My Heart&quot; and &quot;Blue Kentucky Girl&quot;.

Lynn&#x27;s first self-penned song to crack the Top 10, 1966&#x27;s &quot;Dear Uncle Sam&quot;, was among the first recordings to recount the human costs of the Vietnam War. Her 1966 hit &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Woman Enough (To Take My Man)&quot; made Lynn the first country female recording artist to write a No.1 hit.

===1967–1980: Breakthrough success===
In 1967, Lynn released the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Home A-Drinkin&#x27; (With Lovin&#x27; on Your Mind)&quot;, It was her second number one country hit.

Lynn&#x27;s next album, &quot;Fist City&quot;, was released in 1968. The title track became Lynn&#x27;s third No. 1 hit, as a single earlier that year, and the other single from the album, &quot;What Kind of a Girl (Do You Think I Am)&quot;, peaked within the top 10. In 1968, her next studio album, &quot;Your Squaw Is on the Warpath&quot;, spawned two Top 5 Country hits, including the title track and &quot;You&#x27;ve Just Stepped In (From Stepping Out on Me)&quot;. In 1969, her next single, &quot;Woman of the World (Leave My World Alone)&quot;, was Lynn&#x27;s fourth chart-topper, followed by a subsequent Top 10, &quot;To Make a Man (Feel Like a Man)&quot;. Her song &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Woman Enough (To Take My Man)&quot;, was an instant hit and became one of Lynn&#x27;s all-time most popular. Her career continued to be successful into the 1970s, especially following the success of her autobiographical hit &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart in 1970. The song became her first single to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at No. 83. She had a series of singles that charted low on the Hot 100 between 1970 and 1975. In 1978, she became a special guest star on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. The song &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; later served as the impetus for her bestselling autobiography (1976) and the Oscar-winning biopic, both of which share the song&#x27;s title.

In 1973, &quot;Rated &quot;X&quot;&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart and was considered one of Lynn&#x27;s most controversial hits. The following year, her next single, &quot;Love Is the Foundation&quot;, also became a No. 1 country hit from her album of the same name. The second and last single from that album, &quot;Hey Loretta&quot;, became a Top 5 hit. Lynn continued to reach the Top 10 until the end of the decade, including 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Pill&quot;, one of the first songs to discuss birth control. Many of Lynn&#x27;s songs were autobiographical, and as a songwriter, Lynn felt no topic was off limits, as long as it was relatable to women. In 1976, she released her autobiography, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, with the help of writer George Vecsey. It became a bestseller, with more than 8 weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

====Professional partnership with Conway Twitty====
In 1971, Lynn began a professional partnership with Conway Twitty. As a duo, Lynn and Twitty had five consecutive No. 1 hits between 1971 and 1975, including &quot;After the Fire Is Gone&quot; (1971), which won them a Grammy award; &quot;Lead Me On&quot; (1971); &quot;Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man&quot; (1973); &quot;As Soon as I Hang Up the Phone&quot; (1974); and &quot;Feelins&#x27;&quot; (1974). For four consecutive years, 1972–1975, Lynn and Twitty were named the &quot;Vocal Duo of the Year&quot; by the Country Music Association. The Academy of Country Music named them the &quot;Best Vocal Duet&quot; in 1971, 1974, 1975, and 1976. The American Music awards selected them as the &quot;Favorite Country Duo&quot; in 1975, 1976, and 1977. The fan-voted Music City News readers voted them the No. 1 duet every year between 1971 and 1981, inclusive. In addition to their five No. 1 singles, they had seven other Top 10 hits between 1976 and 1981.

As a solo artist, Lynn continued her success in 1971, achieving her fifth No. 1 solo hit, &quot;One&#x27;s on the Way&quot;, written by poet and songwriter Shel Silverstein. She also charted with &quot;I Wanna Be Free&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Lookin&#x27; at Country&quot;, and 1972&#x27;s &quot;Here I Am Again&quot;, all released on separate albums. The next year, she became the first country star on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot;. In 1972, Lynn was the first woman to be nominated and win Entertainer of the Year at the CMA awards. She won the Female Vocalist of the Year and Duo of the Year with Conway Twitty, beating out George Jones and Tammy Wynette and Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton.

====Tribute album for Patsy Cline, other projects, and honors====
In 1977, Lynn recorded &quot;I Remember Patsy&quot;, an album dedicated to her friend, singer Patsy Cline, who died in a plane crash in 1963. The album covered some of Cline&#x27;s biggest hits. The two singles Lynn released from the album, &quot;She&#x27;s Got You&quot; and &quot;Why Can&#x27;t He Be You&quot;, became hits. &quot;She&#x27;s Got You&quot;, which went to No. 1 by Cline in 1962 and went to No. 1 again by Lynn. &quot;Why Can&#x27;t He Be You&quot; peaked at No. 7. Lynn had her last No. 1 hit in 1978 with &quot;Out of My Head and Back in My Bed&quot;.

In 1979, Lynn had two Top 5 hits, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Feel You Anymore&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Picture of Us on My Mind&quot;, from separate albums.

Devoted to her fans, Lynn told the editor of Salisbury, Maryland&#x27;s newspaper the reason she signed hundreds of autographs: &quot;These people are my fans... I&#x27;ll stay here until the very last one wants my autograph. Without these people, I am nobody. I love these people.&quot; In 1979, she became the spokesperson for Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Crisco Oil. Because of her dominant hold on the 1970s, Lynn was named the &quot;Artist of the Decade&quot; by the Academy of Country Music. She is the only woman to have won this honor.

Lynn became a part of the country music scene in Nashville in the 1960s. In 1967, she had the first of 16 No. 1 hits, out of 70 charted songs as a solo artist and a duet partner. Her later hits include &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Home A-Drinkin&#x27; (With Lovin&#x27; on Your Mind)&quot;, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Woman Enough (To Take My Man)&quot;, &quot;Fist City&quot;, and &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

Lynn focused on women&#x27;s issues with themes about philandering husbands and persistent mistresses. Her music was inspired by issues she faced in her marriage. She increased the boundaries in the conservative genre of country music by singing about birth control (&quot;The Pill&quot;), repeated childbirth (&quot;One&#x27;s on the Way&quot;), double standards for men and women (&quot;Rated &#x27;X&#x27;&quot;), and being widowed by the draft during the Vietnam War (&quot;Dear Uncle Sam&quot;).

Country music radio stations often refused to play her music and in a 1987 interview she said eight of her songs had been banned.

Her bestselling 1976 autobiography, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, was made into an Academy Award–winning film with the same title in 1980, starring Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones. Spacek won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role as Lynn. Lynn&#x27;s album &quot;Van Lear Rose&quot;, released in 2004, was produced by the alternative rock musician Jack White. Lynn and White were nominated for five Grammys and won two.

Lynn received numerous awards in country and American music. She was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1983, the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2008. She was honored in 2010 at the Country Music Awards. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2013. Lynn was a member of the Grand Ole Opry since joining on September 25, 1962. Her debut appearance on the Grand Ole Opry was on October 15, 1960. Lynn recorded 70 albums including 54 studio albums, 15 compilation albums, and a tribute album.

===1980–1989: Movie and popularity===
On March 5, 1980, the film &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; debuted in Nashville and soon became the No. 1 box office hit in the United States. The film starred Sissy Spacek as Loretta and Tommy Lee Jones as her husband, Doolittle &quot;Mooney&quot; Lynn. The film received seven Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Actress Oscar for Spacek, a gold album for the soundtrack album, a Grammy nomination for Spacek, Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music awards, and several Golden Globe awards. The 1980s featured more hits, including &quot;Pregnant Again&quot;, &quot;Naked in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Somebody Led Me Away&quot;. Lynn&#x27;s last Top 10 record as a soloist was 1982&#x27;s &quot;I Lie&quot;, but her releases continued to chart until the end of the decade.

One of her last solo releases was &quot;Heart Don&#x27;t Do This to Me&quot; (1985), which reached No. 19, her last Top 20 hit. Her 1985 album &quot;Just a Woman&quot; spawned a Top 40 hit. In 1987, Lynn lent her voice to a song on k.d. lang&#x27;s album &quot;Shadowland&quot; with country stars Kitty Wells and Brenda Lee, &quot;Honky Tonk Angels Medley&quot;. The album was certified gold and was Grammy nominated for the four women. Lynn&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Who Was That Stranger&quot; would be her last solo album for MCA, which she parted ways with in 1989. She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988.

===1990–2004: Return to country and second autobiography===
Lynn returned to the public eye in 1993 with a hit album, the trio album &quot;Honky Tonk Angels&quot;, recorded with Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. The album peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Country charts and No. 42 on the Billboard Pop charts and charted a single with &quot;Silver Threads and Golden Needles&quot;. The album sold more than 800,000 copies and was certified gold in the United States and Canada. The trio was nominated for Grammy and Country Music Association awards. Lynn released a three-CD boxed set chronicling her career on MCA Records. In 1995, she taped a seven-week series on the Nashville Network (TNN), &quot;Loretta Lynn &amp; Friends&quot;.

In 1995, Loretta was presented with the Pioneer Award at the 30th Academy of Country Music Awards. In 1996, Lynn&#x27;s husband, Oliver Vanetta &quot;Doolittle&quot; Lynn, died five days short of his 70th birthday. In 2000, Lynn released her first album in several years, &quot;Still Country&quot;, in which she included &quot;I Can&#x27;t Hear the Music&quot;, a tribute song to her late husband. She released her first new single in more than 10 years from the album, &quot;Country in My Genes&quot;. The single charted on the Billboard Country singles chart and made Lynn the first woman in country music to chart singles in five decades. In 2002, Lynn published her second autobiography, &quot;Still Woman Enough&quot;, and it became her second &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller, peaking in the top 10. In 2004, she published a cookbook, &quot;You&#x27;re Cookin&#x27; It Country&quot;.

===2004–2022: Late career resurgence===

In 2004, Lynn released &quot;Van Lear Rose&quot;, the second album on which Lynn either wrote or co-wrote every song. Produced by Jack White of The White Stripes, the album featured guitar and backup vocals by White. The collaboration garnered Lynn high praise from the mainstream and alternative rock music press, such as &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; voted it the second best album of 2004, and it won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album of the Year.

Late in 2010, Sony Music released a new compilation album, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter: A Tribute to Loretta Lynn&quot;, featuring stars like Reba McEntire, Faith Hill, Paramore, and Carrie Underwood performing Lynn&#x27;s classic hits spanning 50 years. The album produced a Top 10 hit music video on Great American Country of the single &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, featuring Lynn, Miranda Lambert and Sheryl Crow. The track cracked the Billboard singles chart, making Lynn the only female country artist to chart in six decades. Lynn&#x27;s concerts during this period included performances at the Nelsonville Music Festival in Nelsonville, Ohio, in May 2010, and at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival on June 11, 2011. In 2012, Lynn published her third autobiography, &quot;Honky Tonk Girl: My Life in Lyrics&quot;. She also contributed &quot;Take Your Gun and Go, John&quot; to &quot;Divided &amp; United: Songs of the Civil War&quot;, released on November 5, 2013.

In November 2015, Lynn announced the completion of a new album, &quot;Full Circle&quot;. Released in March 2016, the album debuted at No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 200 and went on to become Lynn&#x27;s 40th album to make the Top 10 on Billboard&#x27;s best selling country chart. It featured a combination of new songs and classics, and duets with Elvis Costello and Willie Nelson.

Lynn&#x27;s holiday album &quot;White Christmas Blue&quot; was released in October 2016. In December of the same year, &quot;Full Circle&quot; was nominated for Country Album of the Year in the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

Following &quot;Full Circle&quot;, the album &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Great&quot; was released by Legacy Recordings in September 2018 after being delayed by health issues, which had caused Lynn to cancel all of her scheduled tour dates in 2017. Lynn was named Artist of a Lifetime by CMT in 2018. On October 19, 2019, Lifetime aired the movie &quot;Patsy &amp; Loretta&quot; which highlighted the friendship of Lynn and Patsy Cline.

On March 19, 2021, Lynn released her 50th studio album &quot;Still Woman Enough&quot;, the fourth album of her deal with Legacy Recordings. Recorded in sessions at Cash Cabin in Tennessee, it features Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire on the title track, alongside duets with Tanya Tucker and Margo Price on re-recordings of &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Woman Enough&quot; and &quot;One&#x27;s on the Way&quot;, respectively.

==Personal life==
===Marriage===
On January 10, 1948, 15-year-old Loretta Webb married 21-year-old Oliver Vanetta Lynn (August 27, 1926 – August 22, 1996), better known as &quot;Doolittle&quot;, &quot;Doo&quot;, or &quot;Mooney&quot;. They had met only a month earlier. The Lynns left Kentucky and moved to the northwest Washington state logging community of Custer when Lynn was seven months pregnant with the first of their six children. The happiness and heartache of her early years of marriage would help to inspire Lynn&#x27;s songwriting. They were married for almost 50 years until his death in 1996 at age 69. In her 2002 autobiography, &quot;Still Woman Enough&quot;, and in an interview with CBS News the same year, she recounted how her husband cheated on her regularly and once left her while she was giving birth. Lynn stated she and her husband fought frequently, but that &quot;he never hit me one time that I didn&#x27;t hit him back twice.&quot; Loretta said that her marriage was &quot;one of the hardest love stories&quot;. In one of her autobiographies, she recalled:
===Children===
Loretta and her husband had six children together. Their eldest daughter, Betty Sue, was born on November 26, 1948, and died of complications associated with emphysema on July 29, 2013. Second child and eldest son Jack Benny Lynn, born December 7, 1949, was found dead by drowning on July 24, 1984, after going missing while horse riding on his mother&#x27;s Hurricane Mills ranch. Their third and fourth children are Ernest Ray Lynn, born May 27, 1951, and Clara Marie &quot;Cissie&quot; Lynn, born less than a year later on April 7, 1952. Their youngest children, twin daughters Peggy Jean and Patsy Eileen, were born on August 6, 1964; they are named after Lynn&#x27;s sister, Peggy Sue Wright, and her friend, Patsy Cline. Patsy&#x27;s daughter and Loretta&#x27;s granddaughter, Emmy Russell, auditioned for season 22 of American Idol, making the cut and earning the golden ticket to Hollywood.

===Loretta Lynn&#x27;s Ranch===
Lynn owned a ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, known as Loretta Lynn&#x27;s Ranch. Billed as &quot;the seventh largest attraction in Tennessee&quot;, it features a recording studio, museums, lodging, restaurants, and western stores. Traditionally, three holiday concerts are hosted annually at the ranch, Memorial Day Weekend, Fourth of July Weekend, and Labor Day Weekend.

The centerpiece of the ranch is its large plantation home which Lynn once resided in with her husband and children. She had not lived in the antebellum mansion in more than 30 years prior to her death. Lynn regularly greeted fans who were touring the house. A replica of the cabin in which Lynn grew up in Butcher Hollow is one of its main features.

Since 1982, the ranch has hosted Loretta Lynn&#x27;s Amateur Championship motocross race, the largest amateur motocross race of its kind. The ranch also hosts GNCC Racing events.

===Politics===
At the height of her popularity, some of Lynn&#x27;s songs were banned from radio airplay, including &quot;Rated &quot;X&quot;&quot;, about the double standards divorced women face; &quot;Wings Upon Your Horns&quot;, about the loss of teenage virginity; and &quot;The Pill&quot;, about a wife and mother becoming liberated by the birth-control pill. Her song &quot;Dear Uncle Sam&quot;, released in 1966, during the Vietnam War, describes a wife&#x27;s anguish at the loss of a husband to war. It was included in her live performances during the Iraq War.

In 1971, Lynn performed at the White House, at the invitation of President Richard Nixon. She returned there to perform during the administrations of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. In 2002&#x27;s &quot;Still Woman Enough&quot;, she discussed her longtime friendship and support for Jimmy Carter. She endorsed and campaigned for George H. W. Bush in the presidential election in 1988.

In 2016, Lynn expressed support for Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign, stumping for him at the end of each of her shows. She stated, &quot;I just think he&#x27;s the only one who&#x27;s going to turn this country around.&quot;

Although Lynn was outspoken about her views on controversial social and political subjects, she saw herself as apolitical, writing in her 1976 autobiography that, &quot;I don&#x27;t like to talk too much about things where you&#x27;re going to get one side or the other unhappy...My music has no politics.&quot;

While a recognized &quot;advocate for ordinary women&quot;, Lynn often criticized upper-class feminism for ignoring the needs and concerns of working-class women. She rejected being labeled a feminist, and wrote in her memoir, &quot;I&#x27;m not a big fan of women&#x27;s liberation, but maybe it will help women stand up for the respect they&#x27;re due.&quot;

When asked about her position on same-sex marriage by &quot;USA Today&quot; in November 2010, she replied, &quot;I&#x27;m still an old Bible girl. God said you need to be a woman and man, but everybody to their own.&quot;

Lynn allowed PETA to use her song &quot;I Wanna Be Free&quot; in a public service campaign to discourage the chaining of dogs outdoors in the cold.

===Health and death===
Over the years, Lynn suffered from various health concerns, including pneumonia on multiple occasions and a broken arm after a fall at home.

In May 2017, Lynn had a stroke at her home in Hurricane Mills. She was taken to a Nashville hospital and as a result had to cancel all of her upcoming tour dates. The release of her album &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Great&quot; was delayed until 2018. On January 1, 2018, Lynn fell and broke her hip.

Lynn died in her sleep at her home in Hurricane Mills on October 4, 2022, at the age of 90. No cause of death was immediately given. She was buried three days later on her Hurricane Mills ranch beside her husband Doolittle.

<text>John or Hans (; 2 February 1455 – 20 February 1513) was a Scandinavian monarch who ruled under the Kalmar Union. He was King of Denmark from 1481 to 1513, King of Norway from 1483 to 1513, and King of Sweden (where he has also been called Johan II) from 1497 to 1501. Additionally, from 1482 to 1513, he held the titles of Duke of Schleswig and Holstein, which he governed jointly with his brother, Frederick.

The three most important political goals of King John were the restoration of the Kalmar Union, reduction of the dominance of the Hanseatic League, and the building of a strong Danish royal power.

==Biography==
===Early life===
John was born on 2 February 1455, probably at Aalborg in Northern Jutland. He was the third but eldest surviving son of Christian I of Denmark and Dorothea of Brandenburg, daughter of Margrave John of Brandenburg.

===Reign===

In 1458, King Christian I, the father of John, had the Norwegian Council of the Realm commit to electing Christian&#x27;s eldest son as next king of Norway upon his death. A similar declaration was made in Sweden. In 1467, John was hailed as successor to the throne in Denmark. John used the title &quot;heir&quot; to the throne of Norway, in line with Norway&#x27;s old status as a hereditary kingdom, but this was a claim the Norwegian Council did not immediately recognise. Consequently, upon King Christian&#x27;s death in May 1481, John&#x27;s position was unchallenged in Denmark, whereas in Norway the Council of the Realm assumed royal authority, and an interregnum ensued. No serious rival candidates to the Norwegian throne existed, but the council was determined to demonstrate Norway&#x27;s status as a sovereign kingdom. A meeting between the Councils of Denmark, Sweden and Norway was appointed for 13 January 1483 at Halmstad, to work out the terms for electing John as king—his håndfæstning. The Swedish Council failed to turn up at the meeting, but the Norwegian and Danish councils proceeded to produce a joint declaration containing the terms for John&#x27;s rule, and electing him king. It was hoped that Sweden would later accept the same document and thereby acknowledge John as king. Subsequently, John was crowned King of Denmark in Copenhagen on 18 May, and King of Norway in Trondheim on 20 July.

During the first years of his rule John carried out a balancing policy. By diplomatic means he tried to weaken the position of the Swedish regent Sten Sture, and he also sought new allies—he was the first Danish king to establish political cooperation with Russia. After the 1493 treaty, Ivan III of Russia imprisoned all Hanseatic merchants trading in Novgorod and instigated the Russo-Swedish War (1496–1499). The Hanseatic cities were also troubled by a secret war by Danish privateers. At that time the position of the Hansabund was slowly but steadily declining because of changes in trade routes and the growing opposition against the Hanseatic League in the Northern European naval states.

John&#x27;s domestic policies were marked by economic support of the Danish merchants and by the widespread use of commoners as officials or even as councillors, something which angered the nobility. The most important of his initiatives was perhaps establishing a permanent Danish navy, one which came to play a role during his later years.

According to the Privilege of Ribe the Noble Diets of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were to elect a duke among the sons of the previous duke. Many nobles in Schleswig and Holstein preferred John&#x27;s much younger brother Frederick, but John successfully argued for electing &quot;both&quot; the late king&#x27;s sons as co-dukes. Although it was initially agreed they should govern the duchies jointly, at the majority of Frederick (in 1490) the duchies were nevertheless divided.

In the meantime, John had initially approved to join a crusade plan as presented in Rome on 25 March 1490, in which Nordic soldiers would be part of a coalition of armies fighting the Turks of the Ottoman Empire; however, he sent a legate with a letter to Julius II to explain that he had many conflicts at home, which would prevent him from implementing such endeavor.

In June 1495, John set sail with a fleet for Kalmar, Sweden. Along with the Danish and Norwegian Councils, he expected to meet with the Swedish Council. His goal was the reunification of the Nordic region under his rule: a renewed Kalmar Union. Along the way from Copenhagen to Kalmar, John&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Gribshunden&quot;, suffered an explosion and sank at anchor near the town of Ronneby. John was not aboard at the time; he survived and continued on to Kalmar. However, Sten Sture repeatedly delayed his own arrival, and Hans finally abandoned the summit in August to return exhausted to Copenhagen. Direct diplomacy had failed, so John turned to other means to achieve his ambition.

On 6 October 1497, John conquered Sweden during a short and effective military campaign, defeating Sten Sture at the Battle of Rotebro after having undermined his position by winning over most of the Swedish nobility. Sten surrendered to King John in Stockholm and was reconciled with him. John was crowned King of Sweden, and Sten was given the highest position of authority in Sweden below the King.

In 1500, John made an attempt at conquering Dithmarschen (in today&#x27;s Schleswig-Holstein), an area which the kings of Denmark had long viewed as belonging to their realm, but which was in reality an independent peasant republic under the loose overlordship of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. By mid-January 1500 John hired the &quot;Black Guard&quot; of ruthless and violent Dutch and East Frisian mercenaries, commanded by Thomas Slentz, prior operating for Magnus, vicegerent in the Land of Hadeln.
John guaranteed for its safe conduct first southeastwards via Lunenburg-Cellean Winsen upon Luhe and Hoopte, crossing the Elbe by Zollenspieker Ferry to the Hamburg-Lübeckian condominial Bergedorf and Vierlande. From there the &quot;Black Guard&quot; headed northwestwards again, through Holstein towards Ditmarsh. Together with his brother Frederick, John then carried out a large-scale campaign with the Black Guard, but the Ditmarsians under Wulf Isebrand&#x27;s command caught most of the Guard in a trap at the Battle of Hemmingstedt after having opened the dykes of the low-land area and flooded the narrow main road. Thus John&#x27;s attempt to subject the Ditmarsian free peasants to feudalism ended for time being.

The defeat in the Battle of Hemmingstedt on 17 February 1500 hurt John&#x27;s prestige and in 1501, Sweden renounced him as king. John fought an increasingly more bitter war against Sten Sture and his successor Svante Nilsson, and this conflict meant frictions with both the Danish nobility and the Hanseatic cities, especially Lübeck. In 1509, with the Netherlands acting as arbiter, Sweden agreed to a declaration which recognised John as king of Sweden in principle, but he was never allowed into Stockholm as long as he lived, nor crowned king of Sweden anew.

Meanwhile, Norwegian attempts at opposition were strangled by John&#x27;s son Prince Christian (afterward King Christian II), who was the viceroy of Norway from 1506 until he became king in 1513. Between 1510 and 1512, the king fought a last war with both Sweden and Lübeck in which Denmark was at first very pressed but, with the help of the Scottish Barton brothers, partly turned the tables with a naval offensive. The result concerning Sweden was the status quo, but Lübeck suffered a real political and economic setback by the peace.

In his own age, and partly to posterity, John has often appeared a &quot;commoner&#x27;s king&quot;, a jolly and plain man with a folksy manner. Behind the surface, however, he seems to have been a hard realist and a zealous political calculator. In many ways he is a Scandinavian parallel of Louis XI of France and Henry VII of England.

===Death and burial===
In 1513, King John died at Aalborghus Castle a short time after being thrown from his horse. King John was buried in the church of the Franciscan friary in Odense. Queen Christina, who lived the latter part of her life in a nunnery in Odense, commissioned the famous German sculptor Claus Berg to create a magnificent burial chapel, where both she and her husband were laid to rest after her death in 1521. The late Gothic altarpiece carved by Berg between 1515 and 1525 is one of Denmark&#x27;s national treasures. Each of the three sections is intricately carved and gilded. It survived the iconoclastic fervour of the Protestant Reformation perhaps because of its connection with the royal burials. The son of King John and Queen Christina, King Christian II, with his wife Isabella of Austria, was also interred in the royal family chapel. In 1807, the former Franciscan church was demolished, and Berg&#x27;s altarpiece and six royal bodies were transferred to St. Canute&#x27;s Cathedral, also in Odense.

===Succession===
The 32-year-old heir, Christian II of Denmark assumed the throne but was deposed in 1523. John&#x27;s bloodline eventually returned to the Danish and Norwegian thrones in the person of Christian IV of Denmark, the great-great-grandson of his daughter, Electress Elisabeth.

==Full title==
John&#x27;s full title as King of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway was:
&quot;King of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn and Dithmarschen, Count of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst&quot;

==Issue==
In 1478, John married Christina of Saxony, daughter of Elector Ernst of Saxony and Elisabeth of Bavaria. 

The Danish geneological tradition mentions five children of John and Christina:

The &quot;Oldenburgisch Chronicon&quot; from 1599 cites sources mentioning additional sons named Johan and Jacob. Jørgen Nybo Rasmussen has argued that the latter can be identified as Jacobus de Dacia (1484–1566), a Franciscan friar who served as a missionary in Mexico.

During the last decade of his life, John had a relationship with Edele Jernskjæg (died 1512).

<text>The Central African Empire () was established on 4 December 1976 when the then-President of the Central African Republic, Jean-Bédel Bokassa, declared himself Emperor of Central Africa. The empire would fall less than three years later when French and Central African forces overthrew Bokassa and re-established the Central African Republic on 21 September 1979.

==History==

===Proclamation===
In September 1976, President Jean-Bédel Bokassa dissolved the government of the Central African Republic and replaced it with the Central African Revolutionary Council. On 4 December 1976, at the ruling MESAN party congress, Bokassa instituted a new constitution, converted back to Roman Catholicism after briefly converting to Islam earlier in the year, and declared the country to be a monarchy. He had himself crowned Emperor of Central Africa on 4 December 1977.

Bokassa&#x27;s full title was &quot;Emperor of Central Africa by the Will of the Central African People, United within the National Political Party, the MESAN&quot; and used the style &quot;His Imperial Majesty&quot;. His regalia, lavish coronation ceremony, and regime were largely inspired by Napoleon, who had converted the French First Republic into the First French Empire. The coronation ceremony was estimated to cost his country roughly (XAF12,230,000,000,00 in modern values), one-third of the country&#x27;s budget and all of France&#x27;s aid for that year.

Bokassa justified his actions by claiming that creating a monarchy would help Central Africa &quot;stand out&quot; from the rest of the continent, and earn the world&#x27;s respect. Despite invitations, no foreign leaders attended the event. Bokassa was widely ridiculed for this act, with his egotistical extravagance compared with that of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin.
===Overthrow===

By January 1979, French support for Bokassa had eroded after riots in Bangui led to a massacre of civilians. Between 17 and 19 April, a number of high school students were arrested after they had protested against wearing the expensive, government-required school uniforms; an estimated 100 were killed in the Ngaragba Prison massacre.

Emperor Bokassa personally participated in the massacre, where he was reported beating dozens of children to death with his own cane. The massive press coverage which followed the deaths of the students opened the way for a successful coup which saw French troops in Operation Caban and subsequently Operation Barracuda restore former president David Dacko to power while Bokassa was away in Libya meeting with Gaddafi on 20 September 1979.

Bokassa&#x27;s overthrow by the French government was called &quot;France&#x27;s last colonial expedition&quot; by veteran French diplomat and regime change architect Jacques Foccart. François Mitterrand refused to have France intervene in this manner again. Operation Barracuda began the night of 20 September and ended early the next morning. An undercover commando squad from the French intelligence agency SDECE, joined by the 1st Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment led by Colonel Brancion-Rouge, landed by Transall C-160, and managed to secure Bangui M&#x27;Poko International Airport. Upon arrival of two more transport aircraft, a message was sent to Colonel Degenne to come in with eight Puma helicopters and Transall aircraft, which took off from N&#x27;Djaména military airport in neighbouring Chad.

By 12:30 p.m. on 21 September 1979, the pro-French Dacko proclaimed the fall of the Central African Empire. David Dacko remained president until he was overthrown on 1 September 1981, by General André Kolingba.

Bokassa died on 3 November 1996, in the Central African Republic. In 2009, Jean-Serge Bokassa, who was seven years old when the Emperor was overthrown, stated his father&#x27;s reign was &quot;indefensible&quot;.

==International response==

===France&#x27;s role===
When Jean-Bédel Bokassa took control of the Central African Republic, the French president at the time, Charles de Gaulle, did not want to engage with the new leader, refusing to receive him and calling him a &quot;bloody idiot.&quot; After heavy advising from his chief of staff, Jacques Foccart, De Gaulle finally met Bokassa in 1969, three years after he came into power. After Charles De Gaulle died and Georges Pompidou exited office, Valery Giscard d&#x27;Estaing took office in 1974. Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Bokassa engaged in correspondence and with Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s administration, France and the Central African Empire became close allies. When Bokassa declared that he was going to be hosting a coronation for himself as the emperor of the new Central African Empire, many of the novelties that attributed to the luxurious event came from France. This included an imperial crown as well as a golden throne in the shape of an eagle. After various allegations against Bokassa including the beating of school children as well as cannibalism, France intervened with two operations that sought to remove Bokassa from office, the final one being Operation Barracuda.

===President Valéry Giscard===
Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing became the President of France in May 1974, where his relationship with Bokassa was more interactive than previous administrations. During his first visit to the country in 1970, Bokassa presented him with diamonds and ivory carvings. Giscard advised Bokassa to avoid a ceremony on the scale of Napoleon due to the Central African Empire&#x27;s financial situation; however, though Bokassa ignored Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s warning, Giscard d&#x27;Estaing was the first to congratulate Bokassa on the transition to Empire. Their relationship made news on 10 October 1979 when a newspaper named the &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; broke a story about Bokassa giving thirty carats of diamonds to Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and accused him of giving Giscard d&#x27;Estaing a plethora of gifts on his visits to the empire. These included elephant tusks, ivory carved objects as well as precious stones estimated to be worth one million francs. This scandal was later called &quot;Diamondgate&quot; or the Diamonds Affair scandal which contributed to Giscard d&#x27;Estaing losing the presidency in the 1981 elections.

===Operation Barracuda===
Operation Barracuda was initiated in 1979 after the death of several school children after a protest that was shut down with many students imprisoned in Ngaraba. France severed ties with Bokassa, and began to plan his excommunication when the emperor began working with Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader. Operation Barracuda entailed French soldiers entering the country while Bokassa was on a trip to Libya and instating David Dacko, who had been exiled to Paris, as the new leader. France cut off all humanitarian aid for media presence and then later sent French troops into Bangui, the nation&#x27;s capital, to install David Dacko as the new leader. Dacko stayed in a hotel in France, where he was exiled, awaiting the call to be transported into the nation as soon as Bokassa made himself unavailable. Leaders from Chad, Congo (then Zaire) all agreed to the idea as well as to aid the French in transport and military support for Operation Barracuda. This operation&#x27;s success effectively ended the Central African Empire and reintroduced the Central African Republic.

<doc id="176320" wikidata="Q210980" url="?curid=176320" title="Virtual community">
<text>A virtual community is a social network of individuals who connect through specific social media, potentially crossing geographical and political boundaries in order to pursue mutual interests or goals. Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are online communities operating under social networking services.

Howard Rheingold discussed virtual communities in his book, &quot;The Virtual Community&quot;, published in 1993. The book&#x27;s discussion ranges from Rheingold&#x27;s adventures on The WELL, computer-mediated communication, social groups and information science. Technologies cited include Usenet, MUDs (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives MUSHes and MOOs, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), chat rooms and electronic mailing lists. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community. At the same time, it showed that job engagement positively influences virtual communities of practice engagement.

Virtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate. Some virtual communities do both. Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: message boards, chat rooms, social networking World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds. Members usually become attached to the community world, logging in and out on sites all day every day, which can certainly become an addiction.

==Introduction==

The traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages, etc.). Virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition. Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members, then a virtual community is certainly a community. Virtual communities resemble real life &quot;communities&quot; in the sense that they both provide support, information, friendship and acceptance between strangers. While in a virtual community space, users may be expected to feel a sense of belonging and a mutual attachment among the members that are in the space.

One of the most influential part about virtual communities is the opportunity to communicate through several media platforms or networks. Now that virtual communities exists, this had leveraged out the things we once did prior to virtual communities, such as postal services, fax machines, and even speaking on the telephone. Early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of reality, whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research into the social sciences definition of ontology. In the seventeenth century, scholars associated with the Royal Society of London formed a community through the exchange of letters. &quot;Community without propinquity&quot;, coined by urban planner Melvin Webber in 1963 and &quot;community liberated&quot;, analyzed by Barry Wellman in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community. As well, Benedict Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Imagined Communities&quot; in 1983, described how different technologies, such as national newspapers, contributed to the development of national and regional consciousness among early nation-states. Some authors that built their theories on Anderson&#x27;s imagined communities have been critical of the concept, claiming that all communities are based on communication and that virtual/real dichotomy is disintegrating, making use of the word &quot;virtual&quot; problematic or even obsolete.

==Purpose==

Virtual communities are used for a variety of social and professional groups; interaction between community members vary from personal to purely formal. For example, an email distribution list could serve as a personal means of communicating with family and friends, and also formally to coordinate with coworkers.

=== User experience testing to determine social codes ===
User experience is the ultimate goal for the program or software used by an internet community, because user experience will determine the software&#x27;s success. The software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users&#x27; experience and designed specifically for online use.
User experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system. When it comes to testing user experience in a software interface, three main characteristics are needed: a user who is engaged, a user who is interacting with a product or interface, and defining the users&#x27; experience in ways that are and observable or measurable.
User experience metrics are based on a reliability and repeatability, using a consistent set of measurements to result in comparable outcomes. User experience metrics are based on user retention, using a consistent set of measurements to collect data on user experience. 
The widespread use of the Internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers. The vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience. Some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning, productivity, user satisfaction, how much people remember using the software, and how many errors they make.
The human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community. The success of online communities depend on the integration of usability and social semiotics. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user&#x27;s habits when interacting with a program. Social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns. People communicate their social identities or culture code through the work they do, the way they talk, the clothes they wear, their eating habits, domestic environments and possessions, and use of leisure time. Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user&#x27;s habits when interacting with a program. The information provided during a usability test can determine demographic factors and help define the semiotic social code. Dialogue and social interactions, support information design, navigation support, and accessibility are integral components specific to online communities. As virtual communities grow, so do the diversity of their users. However, the technologies are not made to be any more or less intuitive. Usability tests can ensure users are communicating effectively using social and semiotic codes while maintaining their social identities. Efficient communication requires a common set of signs in the minds of those seeking to communicate. As technologies evolve and mature, they tend to be used by an increasingly diverse set of users. This kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology does no necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use. Usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities.

==Effects==

===On health===

Recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues. These forms of social networks allow for open conversation between individuals who are going through similar experiences, whether themselves or in their family. Such sites have so grown in popularity that now many health care providers form groups for their patients by providing web areas where one may direct questions to doctors. These sites prove especially useful when related to rare medical conditions. People with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community, thus online communities act as primary means for such support. Online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease, as well as offer more practical support, such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease. Each patient on online health communities are on there for different reasons, as some may need quick answers to questions they have, or someone to talk to.Involvement in social communities of similar health interests has created a means for patients to develop a better understanding and behavior towards treatment and health practices. Some of these users could have very serious life-threatening issues which these personal contexts could become very helpful to these users, as the issues are very complex. Patients increasingly use such outlets, as this is providing personalized and emotional support and information, that will help them and have a better experience. The extent to which these practices have effects on health are still being studied.

Studies on health networks have mostly been conducted on groups which typically suffer the most from extreme forms of diseases, for example cancer patients, HIV patients, or patients with other life-threatening diseases. It is general knowledge that one participates in online communities to interact with society and develop relationships. Individuals who suffer from rare or severe illnesses are unable to meet physically because of distance or because it could be a risk to their health to leave a secure environment. Thus, they have turned to the internet.

Some studies have indicated that virtual communities can provide valuable benefits to their users. Online health-focused communities were shown to offer a unique form of emotional support that differed from event-based realities and informational support networks. Growing amounts of presented material show how online communities affect the health of their users. Apparently the creation of health communities has a positive impact on those who are ill or in need of medical information.

===On civic participation===

It was found that young individuals are more bored with politics and history topics, and instead are more interested in celebrity dramas and topics. Young individuals claim that &quot;voicing what you feel&quot; does not mean &quot;being heard&quot;, so they feel the need to not participate in these engagements, as they believe they are not being listened to anyway. Over the years, things have changed, as new forms of civic engagement and citizenship have emerged from the rise of social networking sites. Networking sites act as a medium for expression and discourse about issues in specific user communities. Online content-sharing sites have made it easy for youth as well as others to not only express themselves and their ideas through digital media, but also connect with large networked communities. Within these spaces, young people are pushing the boundaries of traditional forms of engagement such as voting and joining political organizations and creating their own ways to discuss, connect, and act in their communities.

Civic engagement through online volunteering has shown to have positive effects on personal satisfaction and development. Some 84 percent of online volunteers found that their online volunteering experience had contributed to their personal development and learning.

===On communication===
In his book &quot;The Wealth of Networks&quot; from 2006, Yochai Benkler suggests that virtual communities would &quot;come to represent a new form of human communal existence, providing new scope for building a shared experience of human interaction&quot;. Although Benkler&#x27;s prediction has not become entirely true, clearly communications and social relations are extremely complex within a virtual community. The two main effects that can be seen according to Benkler are a &quot;thickening of preexisting relations with friends, family and neighbours&quot; and the beginnings of the &quot;emergence of greater scope for limited-purpose, loose relationships&quot;. Despite being acknowledged as &quot;loose&quot; relationships, Benkler argues that they remain meaningful.

Previous concerns about the effects of Internet use on community and family fell into two categories: 1) sustained, intimate human relations &quot;are critical to well-functioning human beings as a matter of psychological need&quot; and 2) people with &quot;social capital&quot; are better off than those who lack it. It leads to better results in terms of political participation. However, Benkler argues that unless Internet connections actually displace direct, unmediated, human contact, there is no basis to think that using the Internet will lead to a decline in those nourishing connections we need psychologically, or in the useful connections we make socially. Benkler continues to suggest that the nature of an individual changes over time, based on social practices and expectations. There is a shift from individuals who depend upon locally embedded, unmediated and stable social relationships to networked individuals who are more dependent upon their own combination of strong and weak ties across boundaries and weave their own fluid relationships. Manuel Castells calls this the &quot;networked society&quot;.

=== On identity ===
In 1997, MCI Communications released the &quot;Anthem&quot; advertisement, heralding the internet as a utopia without age, race, or gender. Lisa Nakamura argues in chapter 16 of her 2002 book &quot;After/image of identity: Gender, Technology, and Identity Politics&quot;, that technology gives us iterations of our age, race and gender in virtual spaces, as opposed to them being fully extinguished. Nakamura uses a metaphor of &quot;after-images&quot; to describe the cultural phenomenon of expressing identity on the internet. The idea is that any performance of identity on the internet is simultaneously present and past-tense, &quot;posthuman and projectionary&quot;, due to its immortality.

Sherry Turkle, professor of Social Studies of Science and Technology at MIT, believes the internet is a place where actions of discrimination are less likely to occur. In her 1995 book &quot;Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet&quot;, she argues that discrimination is easier in reality as it is easier to identify as face value, what is contrary to one&#x27;s norm. The internet allows for a more fluid expression of identity and thus people become more accepting of inconsistent personae within themselves and others. For these reasons, Turkle argues users existing in online spaces are less compelled to judge or compare themselves to their peers, allowing people in virtual settings an opportunity to gain a greater capacity for acknowledging diversity.

Nakamura argues against this view, coining the term identity tourism in her 1999 article &quot;Race In/For Cyberspace: Identity Tourism and Racial Passing on the Internet&quot;. Identity tourism, in the context of cyberspace, is a term used to the describe the phenomenon of users donning and doffing other-race and other-gender personae. Nakamura finds that performed behavior from these identity tourists often perpetuate stereotypes.

In the 1998 book &quot;Communities in Cyberspace&quot;, authors Marc A. Smith and Peter Kollock, perceives the interactions with strangers are based upon with whom we are speaking or interacting with. People use everything from clothes, voice, body language, gestures, and power to identify others, which plays a role with how they will speak or interact with them. Smith and Kollock believes that online interactions breaks away of all of the face-to-face gestures and signs that people tend to show in front of one another. Although this is difficult to do online, it also provides space to play with one&#x27;s identity.

==== Gender ====
The gaming community is extremely vast and accessible to a wide variety of people, However, there are negative effects on the relationships &quot;gamers&quot; have with the medium when expressing identity of gender. Adrienne Shaw notes in her 2012 article &quot;Do you identify as a gamer? Gender, race, sexuality, and gamer identity&quot;, that gender, perhaps subconsciously, plays a large role in identifying oneself as a &quot;gamer&quot;. According to Lisa Nakamura, representation in video games has become a problem, as the minority of players from different backgrounds who are not just the stereotyped white teen male gamer are not represented.

==Types==

=== Internet-based ===
The explosive diffusion of the Internet since the mid-1990s fostered the proliferation of virtual communities in the form of social networking services and online communities. Virtual communities may synthesize Web 2.0 technologies with the community, and therefore have been described as Community 2.0, although strong community bonds have been forged online since the early 1970s on timeshare systems like PLATO and later on Usenet. Online communities depend upon social interaction and exchange between users online. This interaction emphasizes the reciprocity element of the unwritten social contract between community members.

===Internet message boards===

An online message board is a forum where people can discuss thoughts or ideas on various topics or simply express an idea. Users may choose which thread, or board of discussion, they would like to read or contribute to. A user will start a discussion by making a post. Other users who choose to respond can follow the discussion by adding their own posts to that thread at any time. Unlike in spoken conversations, message boards do not usually have instantaneous responses; users actively go to the website to check for responses.

Anyone can register to participate in an online message board. People can choose to participate in the virtual community, even if or when they choose not to contribute their thoughts and ideas. Unlike chat rooms, at least in practice, message boards can accommodate an almost infinite number of users.

Internet users&#x27; urges to talk to and reach out to strangers online is unlike those in real-life encounters where people are hesitant and often unwilling to step in to help strangers. Studies have shown that people are more likely to intervene when they are the only one in a situation. With Internet message boards, users at their computers are alone, which might contribute to their willingness to reach out. Another possible explanation is that people can withdraw from a situation much more easily online than off. They can simply click exit or log off, whereas they would have to find a physical exit and deal with the repercussions of trying to leave a situation in real life. The lack of status that is presented with an online identity also might encourage people, because, if one chooses to keep it private, there is no associated label of gender, age, ethnicity or lifestyle.

===Online chat rooms===

Shortly after the rise of interest in message boards and forums, people started to want a way of communicating with their &quot;communities&quot; in real time. The downside to message boards was that people would have to wait until another user replied to their posting, which, with people all around the world in different time frames, could take a while. The development of online chat rooms allowed people to talk to whoever was online at the same time they were. This way, messages were sent and online users could immediately respond.

The original development by CompuServe CB hosted forty channels in which users could talk to one another in real time. The idea of forty different channels led to the idea of chat rooms that were specific to different topics. Users could choose to join an already existent chat room they found interesting, or start a new &quot;room&quot; if they found nothing to their liking. Real-time chatting was also brought into virtual games, where people could play against one another and also talk to one another through text. Now, chat rooms can be found on all sorts of topics, so that people can talk with others who share similar interests. Chat rooms are now provided by Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and other individual websites such as Yahoo, MSN, and AOL.

Chat room users communicate through text-based messaging. Most chat room providers are similar and include an input box, a message window, and a participant list. The input box is where users can type their text-based message to be sent to the providing server. The server will then transmit the message to the computers of anyone in the chat room so that it can be displayed in the message window. The message window allows the conversation to be tracked and usually places a time stamp once the message is posted. There is usually a list of the users who are currently in the room, so that people can see who is in their virtual community.

Users can communicate as if they are speaking to one another in real life. This &quot;simulated reality&quot; attribute makes it easy for users to form a virtual community, because chat rooms allow users to get to know one another as if they were meeting in real life. The individual &quot;room&quot; feature also makes it more likely that the people within a chat room share a similar interest; an interest that allows them to bond with one another and be willing to form a friendship.

===Virtual worlds===

Virtual worlds are the most interactive of all virtual community forms. In this type of virtual community, people are connected by living as an avatar in a computer-based world. Users create their own avatar character (from choosing the avatar&#x27;s outfits to designing the avatar&#x27;s house) and control their character&#x27;s life and interactions with other characters in the 3D virtual world. It is similar to a computer game; however, there is no objective for the players. A virtual world simply gives users the opportunity to build and operate a fantasy life in the virtual realm. Characters within the world can talk to one another and have almost the same interactions people would have in reality. For example, characters can socialize with one another and hold intimate relationships online.

This type of virtual community allows for people to not only hold conversations with others in real time, but also to engage and interact with others. The avatars that users create are like humans. Users can choose to make avatars like themselves, or take on an entirely different personality than them. When characters interact with other characters, they can get to know one another through text-based talking and virtual experience (such as having avatars go on a date in the virtual world). A virtual community chat room may give real-time conversations, but people can only talk to one another. In a virtual world, characters can do activities together, just like friends could do in reality. Communities in virtual worlds are most similar to real-life communities because the characters are physically in the same place, even if the users who are operating the characters are not. &quot;Second Life&quot; is one of the most popular virtual worlds on the Internet. Whyville offers an alternative for younger audiences where safety and privacy are a concern. In Whyville, players use the virtual world&#x27;s simulation aspect to experiment and learn about various phenomena.

Another use for virtual worlds has been in business communications. Benefits from virtual world technology such as photo realistic avatars and positional sound create an atmosphere for participants that provides a less fatiguing sense of presence. Enterprise controls that allow the meeting host to dictate the permissions of the attendees such as who can speak, or who can move about allow the host to control the meeting environment. Zoom, is a popular platform that has grown over the COVID-19 pandemic. Where those who host meetings on this platform, can dictate who can or cannot speak, by muting or unmuting them, along with who is able to join. Several companies are creating business based virtual worlds including &quot;Second Life&quot;. These business based worlds have stricter controls and allow functionality such as muting individual participants, desktop sharing, or access lists to provide a highly interactive and controlled virtual world to a specific business or group. Business based virtual worlds also may provide various enterprise features such as Single Sign on with third party providers, or Content Encryption.

===Social network services===
Social networking services are the most prominent type of virtual community. They are either a website or software platform that focuses on creating and maintaining relationships. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are all virtual communities. With these sites, one often creates a profile or account, and adds friends or follow friends. This allows people to connect and look for support using the social networking service as a gathering place. These websites often allow for people to keep up to date with their friends and acquaintances&#x27; activities without making much of an effort. On several of these sites you may be able to video chat, with several people at once, making the connections feel more like you are together. On Facebook, for example, one can upload photos and videos, chat, make friends, reconnect with old ones, and join groups or causes.

===Specialized information communities===
Participatory culture plays a large role in online and virtual communities. In participatory culture, users feel that their contributions are important and that by contributing, they are forming meaningful connections with other users. The differences between being a producer of content on the website and being a consumer on the website become blurred and overlap. According to Henry Jenkins, &quot;Members believe their contributions matter and feel some degree of social connection with one another &quot;(Jenkins, et al. 2005). The exchange and consumption of information requires a degree of &quot;digital literacy&quot;, such that users are able to &quot;archive, annotate, appropriate, transform and recirculate media content&quot; (Jenkins). Specialized information communities centralizes a specific group of users who are all interested in the same topic. For example, TasteofHome.com, the website of the magazine &quot;Taste of Home&quot;, is a specialized information community that focuses on baking and cooking. The users contribute consumer information relating to their hobby and additionally participate in further specialized groups and forums. Specialized Information Communities are a place where people with similar interests can discuss and share their experiences and interests.

==Howard Rheingold&#x27;s study==
Howard Rheingold&#x27;s &quot;Virtual Community&quot; could be compared with Mark Granovetter&#x27;s ground-breaking &quot;strength of weak ties&quot; article published twenty years earlier in the &quot;American Journal of Sociology&quot;. Rheingold translated, practiced and published Granovetter&#x27;s conjectures about strong and weak ties in the online world. His comment on the first page even illustrates the social networks in the virtual society: &quot;My seven year old daughter knows that her father congregates with a family of invisible friends who seem to gather in his computer. Sometimes he talks to them, even if nobody else can see them. And she knows that these invisible friends sometimes show up in the flesh, materializing from the next block or the other side of the world&quot; (page 1). Indeed, in his revised version of &quot;Virtual Community&quot;, Rheingold goes so far to say that had he read Barry Wellman&#x27;s work earlier, he would have called his book &quot;online social networks&quot;.

Rheingold&#x27;s definition contains the terms &quot;social aggregation and personal relationships&quot; (page 3). Lipnack and Stamps (1997) and Mowshowitz (1997) point out how virtual communities can work across space, time and organizational boundaries; Lipnack and Stamps (1997) mention a common purpose; and Lee, Eom, Jung and Kim (2004) introduce &quot;desocialization&quot; which means that there is less frequent interaction with humans in traditional settings, e.g. an increase in virtual socialization. Calhoun (1991) presents a dystopia argument, asserting the impersonality of virtual networks. He argues that IT has a negative influence on offline interaction between individuals because virtual life takes over our lives. He believes that it also creates different personalities in people which can cause frictions in offline and online communities and groups and in personal contacts. (Wellman &amp; Haythornthwaite, 2002). Recently, Mitch Parsell (2008) has suggested that virtual communities, particularly those that leverage Web 2.0 resources, can be pernicious by leading to attitude polarization, increased prejudices and enabling sick individuals to deliberately indulge in their diseases.

==Advantages of Internet communities==
Internet communities offer the advantage of instant information exchange that is not possible in a real-life community. This interaction allows people to engage in many activities from their home, such as: shopping, paying bills, and searching for specific information. Users of online communities also have access to thousands of specific discussion groups where they can form specialized relationships and access information in such categories as: politics, technical assistance, social activities, health (see above) and recreational pleasures. Virtual communities provide an ideal medium for these types of relationships because information can easily be posted and response times can be very fast. Another benefit is that these types of communities can give users a feeling of membership and belonging. Users can give and receive support, and it is simple and cheap to use.

Economically, virtual communities can be commercially successful, making money through membership fees, subscriptions, usage fees, and advertising commission. Consumers generally feel very comfortable making transactions online provided that the seller has a good reputation throughout the community. Virtual communities also provide the advantage of disintermediation in commercial transactions, which eliminates vendors and connects buyers directly to suppliers. Disintermediation eliminates pricey mark-ups and allows for a more direct line of contact between the consumer and the manufacturer.

==Disadvantages of Internet communities==
While instant communication means fast access, it also means that information is posted without being reviewed for correctness. It is difficult to choose reliable sources because there is no editor who reviews each post and makes sure it is up to a certain degree of quality.

In theory, online identities can be kept anonymous which enables people to use the virtual community for fantasy role playing as in the case of &quot;Second Life&quot;″s use of avatars. Some professionals urge caution with users who use online communities because predators also frequent these communities looking for victims who are vulnerable to online identity theft or online predators.

There are also issues surrounding bullying on internet communities. With users not having to show their face, people may use threatening and discriminating acts towards other people because they feel that they would not face any consequences.

There are standing issues with gender and race on the online community as well, where only the majority is represented on the screen, and those of different background and genders are underrepresented.

<text>The Rheingold (&#x27;Rhinegold&#x27;) was a named train that operated between Hook of Holland, near Rotterdam, and Geneva, Switzerland (or Basel before 1965), a distance of , until 1987. Another section of the train started in Amsterdam and was coupled to the &quot;Hoek&quot; cars in Utrecht. The &quot;Rheingold&quot; ran along the Rhine River via Arnhem, Netherlands, and Cologne, Germany, using special luxury coaches. It was named after Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; opera, which romanticized the Rhine. From 1965 until the train&#x27;s discontinuation in 1987, the &quot;Rheingold&quot; was a first-class-only Trans Europ Express (TEE) train.

== Route ==
Geneva (Gare de Cornavin) – Basel SBB – Freiburg – Baden-Baden – Karlsruhe – Mannheim – Mainz – Cologne – Düsseldorf – Duisburg – Utrecht and then in separate trains continuing (still as the &quot;Rheingold&quot;) to both Hook of Holland and Amsterdam. At Hook of Holland, the train had timed connections for ship service to and from Harwich, England. The Geneva–Basel section was added in 1965 and was discontinued in 1980/82 (see later section for details).

== Pre-World War II ==

The first &quot;Rheingold&quot;, which was classified as a &quot;Fernschnellzug&quot; (FD) (trains FFD 101 and FFD 102), started service on May 15, 1928. In the Netherlands it was pulled by the NS 3700-3800-3900 steam locomotive series, in Germany by the &quot;Baureihen&quot; DRG Class 18.3 (Badic IV h, between Mannheim and Basel) and BR 184-5 (Bavarian S 3/6, between Emmerich and Mannheim) and in Switzerland by Ae 4/7 electric locomotives. In 1930, the BR 01 (01 077-181) was used between Mannheim and Basel and permanently from 1935 on, and the NS 3900 in the Netherlands.

The luxurious Pullman-type coaches had a distinct cream/blue livery in 1st and 2nd class, each measuring . At both ends (one behind the locomotive) there was a blue luggage wagon. Some cars had a kitchen, with one kitchen serving two cars. Mitropa waiters served the passengers. The cars were the most technically advanced the DRG had at that time, but were less advanced than the later (from 1939) &quot;Schürzenwagen&quot; (skirted coaches), typical World War II cars. The interiors were designed by artists and architects of the time, and besides being very luxurious were also very spacious. In total, there were 26 coaches and three luggage wagons per train consist. In these days, the trip took 11 hours. At first, the cars had the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft&quot; and MITROPA inscriptions with the DRG logo. Around 1931 the name RHEINGOLD was printed on the coaches and the locomotive tender, and the DRG logo remained. In the fall of 1939, due to the start of World War II, the train service was cancelled.

== Post-World War II ==
The service was reestablished in 1951 as the &quot;Fernzug&quot; (F) Rheingold Express (train numbers F 163/164, later F 9/10 and F 21/22). Most cars survived the war but nevertheless the coaches in Western Germany were painted over and rebuilt to dining coaches (&quot;Gesellschaftwagen&quot;), long distance coaches (F trains) and short distance train coaches (D trains). The &quot;Rheingold&quot; now used skirted coaches and was pulled by the &quot;Deutsche Bundesbahn&quot; steam locomotives BR 01, BR 01.10, BR 03 and BR 03.10 and the BR 41 between Cologne and Kaldenkirchen. In 1954, &quot;Express&quot; was dropped from the train&#x27;s name.

== TEE &quot;Rheingold&quot; ==

In 1962, the &quot;Rheingold&quot; became established again as a link between Switzerland and the Netherlands on the pre-war route, and carrying first-class cars only. In 1965, it became a Trans Europ Express (or Trans-Europe Express).

New rolling stock introduced starting in 1962 included dome cars, one per train, used only on the &quot;Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Rheinpfeil&quot; (Rhine Arrow). In Europe, the use of dome cars was unique to these two trains. After the &quot;Rheinpfeil&quot; was integrated into the Bundesbahn&#x27;s new Intercity network in 1971, the TEE &quot;Erasmus&quot; began using the displaced dome cars, along with the &quot;Rheingold&quot;. The dome cars were withdrawn on 30 May 1976.

The new cars, together with improvements to the track along parts of its route in the mid-1960s, made the &quot;Rheingold&quot; the fastest train in Germany. In 1964, the train was scheduled to cover the Freiburg – Karlsruhe section in 59 minutes, working out to an &quot;average&quot; speed of , which was the &quot;fastest schedule in German rail history&quot; up to that time.

Until about 1972 the train&#x27;s all-first-class, red-and-cream cars were pulled by Class E 10.12 electric locomotives painted in blue-and-cream, but later the red-and-cream Class 103 locomotives took over.
== The later years ==

With effect from the summer timetable in 1979 (on 27 May), the &quot;Rheingold&quot; ceased carrying any coaches to and from Hook of Holland, with Amsterdam thereafter being the northern terminus for all &quot;Rheingold&quot; service. The train&#x27;s Bern–Geneva section was discontinued on 6 April 1980, but was reinstated in autumn 1980 as winter-only service. The Basel–Geneva section was discontinued in 1982. However, during certain times of the year both before 1982 and continuing after, the train carried through coaches to Chur and (until 1985) Milan, which were attached to ordinary express trains south of Basel.

Starting in 1983, the &quot;Rheingold&quot; had a branch to Munich, which separated at Mannheim from the main train (which continued south to Basel). It provided through TEE service between Amsterdam and Munich, also serving Heidelberg, Stuttgart and Augsburg, among other cities, en route. Until 1985, it operated during the summer timetable periods only (circa late May until late September each year). It was introduced on 29 May 1983 and ran until 24 September of that year. This variant was repeated the following summer and again in summer 1985, and then became year-round. During 1985 and 1986, this branch extended beyond Munich to serve one additional city, terminating in Salzburg, Austria. Although the Mannheim – Munich section became year-round at this time (mid-1985), the new Munich – Salzburg section ran only in summer, operating for the last time on 27 September 1986.

Operation of the &quot;Rheingold&quot; ended on May 30, 1987, after 59 years and 15 days. The TEE 6/7 was pulled by a BR 103. It was the last train of the TEE-system in Germany.

One set of &quot;Rheingold&quot; coaches has been preserved by a private company in Switzerland, which are still used to operate steam-hauled excursions.

A complete set of locomotive and blue and cream coaches has been restored by the &quot;Freundeskreis Eisenbahn Köln e.V&quot;.

<text>Adobe InDesign is a desktop publishing and page layout designing software application produced by Adobe and first released in 1999. It can be used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and ebooks. InDesign can also publish content suitable for tablet devices in conjunction with Adobe Digital Publishing Suite. Graphic designers and production artists are the principal users.

InDesign is the successor to Adobe PageMaker, which Adobe acquired by buying Aldus Corporation in late 1994. (Freehand, Aldus&#x27;s competitor to Adobe Illustrator, was licensed from Altsys, the maker of Fontographer.) By 1998, PageMaker had lost much of the professional market to the comparatively feature-rich QuarkXPress version 3.3, released in 1992, and version 4.0, released in 1996. In 1999, Quark announced its offer to buy Adobe and to divest the combined company of PageMaker to avoid problems under United States antitrust law. Adobe declined Quark&#x27;s offer and continued to develop a new desktop publishing application. Aldus had begun developing a successor to PageMaker, code-named &quot;Shuksan&quot;. Later, Adobe code-named the project &quot;K2&quot;, and Adobe released InDesign 1.0 in 1999.

InDesign exports documents in Adobe&#x27;s Portable Document Format (PDF) and supports multiple languages. It was the first DTP application to support Unicode character sets, advanced typography with OpenType fonts, advanced transparency features, layout styles, optical margin alignment, and cross-platform scripting with JavaScript. Later versions of the software introduced new file formats. To support the new features, especially typography, introduced with InDesign CS, the program and its document format are not backward-compatible. Instead, InDesign CS2 introduced the INX () format, an XML-based document representation, to allow backward compatibility with future versions. InDesign CS versions updated with the 3.1 April 2005 update can read InDesign CS2-saved files exported to the format. The InDesign Interchange format does not support versions earlier than InDesign CS. With InDesign CS4, Adobe replaced INX with InDesign Markup Language (IDML), another XML-based document representation.

InDesign was the first native Mac OS X publishing software. With the third major version, InDesign CS, Adobe increased InDesign&#x27;s distribution by bundling it with Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Acrobat in Adobe Creative Suite. Adobe developed InDesign CS3 (and Creative Suite 3) as universal binary software compatible with native Intel and PowerPC Macs in 2007, two years after the announced 2005 schedule, inconveniencing early adopters of Intel-based Macs. Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen said, &quot;Adobe will be first with a complete line of universal applications.&quot;

==Versions==
Newer versions can, as a rule, open files created by older versions, but the reverse is not true. Current versions can export the InDesign file as an IDML file (InDesign Markup Language), which can be opened by InDesign versions from CS4 upwards; older versions from CS4 down can export to an INX file (InDesign Interchange format).

=== Server version ===

In October 2005, Adobe released InDesign Server CS2, a modified version of InDesign (without a user interface) for Windows and Macintosh server platforms. It does not provide any editing client; rather, it is for use by developers in creating client-server solutions with the InDesign plug-in technology. In March 2007 Adobe officially announced Adobe InDesign CS3 Server as part of the Adobe InDesign family.

== Features ==
Paragraph styles are an essential tool for designers when working with text in Adobe InDesign. Despite their menacing appearance, they are straightforward to operate. They can design for a significant amount of time. Other features that make InDesign a good tool for working with text and paragraphs include:
* Creating frames and shapes
* Aligning objects with grids and guides
* Manipulating objects
* Organizing objects
* Importing text
* Formatting text
* Spell checking
* Importing images
* Parent pages (formerly &quot;master pages&quot;)
* Paragraph styles

==Internationalization and localization==
InDesign Middle Eastern editions have unique settings for laying out Arabic or Hebrew text. They feature:
* Text settings: Special settings for laying out Arabic or Hebrew text, such as:
*# Ability to use Arabic, Persian or Hindi digits;
*# Use kashidas for letter spacing and full justification;
*# Ligature option;
*# Adjust the position of diacritics, such as vowels of the Arabic script;
*# Justify text in three possible ways: Standard, Arabic, Naskh;
*# Option to insert special characters, including Geresh, Gershayim, Maqaf for Hebrew and Kashida for Arabic texts;
*# Apply standard, Arabic, or Hebrew styles for page, paragraph, and footnote numbering.
* Bi-directional text flow: Right-to-left behavior applies to several objects: Story, paragraph, character, and table. It allows mixing right-to-left and left-to-right words, paragraphs, and stories in a document. Changing the direction of neutral characters (e.g., / or ?) is possible according to the user&#x27;s keyboard language.
* Table of contents: Provides a table of contents titles, one for each supported language. This table is sorted according to the chosen language. InDesign CS4 Middle Eastern versions allow users to select the language of the index title and cross-references.
* Indices: This allows the creation of a simple keyword index or a somewhat more detailed index of the information in the text using embedded indexing codes. Unlike more sophisticated programs, InDesign cannot insert character style information as part of an index entry (e.g., when indexing book, journal, or movie titles). Indices are limited to four levels (the top level and three sub-levels). Like tables of contents, indices can be sorted according to the selected language.
* Importing and exporting: Can import QuarkXPress files up to version 4.1 (1999), even using Arabic XT, Arabic Phonyx, or Hebrew XPressWay fonts, retaining the layout and content.

<doc id="176324" wikidata="Q37069" url="?curid=176324" title="Alexios IV Angelos">
<text>Alexios IV Angelos (; – February 1204), Latinized as Alexius IV Angelus, was Byzantine Emperor from August 1203 to January 1204. He was the son of Emperor Isaac II Angelos and his first wife, an unknown Palaiologina, who became a nun with the name Irene. His paternal uncle was his predecessor Emperor Alexios III Angelos. He is widely regarded as one of the worst Byzantine emperors for calling upon the Fourth Crusade to help him gain power, which ultimately led to the sack of Constantinople.

==Prince in exile==
The young Alexios was imprisoned in 1195 when Alexios III overthrew Isaac II in a coup. His father was ultimately blinded, but Alexios was largely unharmed. In 1201, two Pisan merchants were employed to smuggle Alexios out of Constantinople to the Holy Roman Empire, where he took refuge with his brother-in-law Philip of Swabia, King of Germany.

According to the contemporary account of Robert of Clari it was while Alexios was at Swabia&#x27;s court that he met with Marquis Boniface of Montferrat, Philip&#x27;s cousin, who had been chosen to lead the Fourth Crusade, but had temporarily left the Crusade during the siege of Zara in 1202 to visit Philip. Boniface and Alexios allegedly discussed diverting the Crusade to Constantinople so that Alexios could be restored to his father&#x27;s throne. Montferrat returned to the Crusade while it wintered at Zara and he was shortly followed by Prince Alexios&#x27;s envoys who offered to the Crusaders 10,000 Byzantine soldiers to help fight in the Crusade, maintain 500 knights in the Holy Land, the service of the Byzantine navy (20 ships) in transporting the Crusader army to Egypt, as well as money to pay off the Crusaders&#x27; debt to the Republic of Venice with 200,000 silver marks. Additionally, he promised to bring the Greek Orthodox Church under the authority of the pope. The Venetians and most of the leaders were in favour of the plan; however, some were not, and there were defections, including Simon de Montfort. In 1202, the fleet arrived at Constantinople. Alexios was paraded outside the walls, but the citizens were apathetic, as Alexios III, though a usurper and illegitimate in the eyes of the westerners, was an acceptable emperor for the Byzantine citizens.

==Emperor==

On 18 July 1203, the Crusaders launched an assault on the city, and Alexios III immediately fled into Thrace. The next morning the Crusaders were surprised to find that the citizens had released Isaac II from prison and proclaimed him emperor, despite the fact that he had been blinded to make him ineligible to rule. The Crusaders could not accept this, and forced Isaac II to proclaim his son Alexios IV co-emperor.

Despite Alexios&#x27; grand promises, Isaac, the more experienced and practical of the two, knew that the Crusaders&#x27; debt could never be repaid from the imperial treasury. Alexios, however, had apparently not grasped how far the empire&#x27;s financial resources had fallen during the previous fifty years. Alexios did manage to raise half the sum promised (100,000 silver marks), by appropriating treasures from the church and by confiscating the property of his enemies. He then attempted to defeat his uncle Alexios III, who remained in control of Thrace. The sack of some Thracian towns helped Alexios&#x27; situation a little, but meanwhile hostility between the restive Crusaders and the inhabitants of Constantinople was growing.

In December 1203, violence exploded between the citizens of Constantinople and the Crusaders. Enraged mobs seized and brutally murdered any foreigner they could lay hands upon, and the Crusaders felt that Alexios had not fulfilled his promises to them. Alexios refused their demands, and is quoted as saying, &quot;&quot;I will not do any more than I have done.&quot; While relations with the Crusaders were deteriorating, Alexios had become deeply unpopular with the Roman citizenry, and with his own father. Blinded and nearly powerless, Isaac II resented having to share the throne with his son; he spread rumours of Alexios&#x27; supposed sexual perversity, alleging he kept company with &quot;depraved men&quot;. The chronicler Nicetas Choniates dismissed Alexios as &quot;childish&quot;&quot; and criticized his familiarity with the Crusaders and his lavish lifestyle. At the beginning of January 1204, Alexios IV retaliated against the Crusaders by setting fire to 17 ships filled with inflammable materials and sending them against the Venetian fleet, but the attempt failed.

==Deposition==
At the end of January 1204, the populace of Constantinople rebelled and tried to proclaim a rival emperor Nicholas Canabus who took sanctuary in the Hagia Sophia. Alexios IV attempted to reach a reconciliation with the Crusaders, entrusting the anti-western courtier Alexios Doukas Murzuphlus with a mission to gain Crusader support. However, Alexios Doukas imprisoned both Alexios IV and his father on the night of 27 January 1204. Isaac II died soon afterwards, possibly of old age or from poison, and Alexios IV was strangled (probably on 8 February). Alexios Doukas was proclaimed emperor as Alexios V. During Alexios IV&#x27;s brief reign, the empire&#x27;s territories along the Black Sea coast declared independence, leading to the Byzantine successor state known as the Empire of Trebizond. The volatile situation in Constantinople at the time ensured that the empire lacked the wherewithal to maintain control of Trebizond, resulting in a de facto recognition of its independence, although it de jure remained an imperial possession.

== The Fourth Crusade ==
In March 1204, Constantinople was in the middle of a succession crisis. Alexios IV had recently deposed the previous emperor, Isaac II. At the same time, a new crusade was starting to form with the intent to resolve the problem in Constantinople. The Byzantines were split among two factions; one that supported the crusade and one that went against the crusade. Eventually however, after the deposition of Alexios IV, who was in favor of the crusade, the Byzantines continued to lack the ability to pay off its debt. The current emperor, Alexios V, was attempting to strengthen the city&#x27;s defense by the time the crusaders arrived, but ultimately the city was sacked. The chaos caused by these events ultimately led to a treaty establishing the Latin Empire which would last until 1261 AD.

== Legacy ==
Alexios IV and his actions brought the empire to a state considerably worse than it had been ever before. It had lost a great deal of territory and would continue to do so due to the power struggle and subsequent crusade. By the end of the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine empire had been reduced to a regional power. It would recuperate somewhat, as the capital of Constantinople would eventually be recovered in 1261, nearly six decades after the short reign of Alexios. However, the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade would ultimately be a key factor in the empire&#x27;s demise to the Ottoman empire two and a half centuries later.

Whether or not Alexios is directly to blame for the decline and fall of the Byzantine Empire is arguable, but due to a number of factors, such as his short reign and dangerous external factors to the safety of the empire, he lacked both the funds and experience necessary to properly handle the situation. He lacked a typical upbringing and education for royalty due to his imprisonment and exile which likely contributed to his lack of experience.

<doc id="176325" wikidata="Q189825" url="?curid=176325" title="Salsa (dance)">
<text>Salsa is the name for Latin American dances that are danced to salsa music. Salsa is one of the most popular types of Latin dance that is practiced worldwide, and is typically danced with a partner, although there are elements of solo footwork as well. There are several distinct styles of salsa that are danced around the world.

==Origin==
The term &quot;salsa&quot; was coined by Johnny Pacheco in the 1960s in New York, as an umbrella term for Cuban dance music being played in the city at the time. Salsa as a dance emerged soon after, being a combination of mambo (which was popular in New York in the 1950s) as well as Latin dances such as Son and Rumba as well as American dances such as swing, hustle, and tap. 

As salsa music spread to other countries, different styles emerged.

==Description==
Salsa dance steps can be done individually, but salsa is most popularly known as a partnered dance where the lead takes the follower through a series of spins and turn patterns to music. Salsa&#x27;s tempo ranges from about 150bpm (beats per minute) to around 250bpm, although most dancing is done to music somewhere between 160 and 220bpm. The basic salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for every four beats of music. Salsa dancers can also break apart to dance solo, known as &quot;shines&quot;.

The two main styles of partnered salsa dancing are linear and circular. In linear salsa, dance couples remain in their &quot;slot&quot;, with each dancer switching places from one side of the slot to the other, similar to West Coast Swing—New York–style salsa and LA-style salsa are both danced this way. The second style of partnered salsa dancing is circular salsa. Here, dancers circle around each other, reminiscent of East Coast Swing. Both Cuban and Colombian salsa follow this circular pattern.

Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing has become very common for both men and women: foot work, arm work, body movement, spins, body isolations, shoulder shimmies, body rolls, hand styling, acrobatics, and even lifts.

==Venues==
Salsa dance socials are commonly held in night clubs, bars, ballrooms, restaurants, and outside, especially if part of an outdoor festival. Salsa dancing is an international dance that can be found in most metropolitan cities in the world. Festivals are held annually, often called a &quot;Salsa Congress&quot;, in various host cities aimed to attract a variety of salsa dancers from other cities and countries. The events bring dancers together to share their passion for the dance, build community, and share moves and tips. These events usually include salsa dance performers, live salsa music, workshops, open dancing, and contests. On the other hand, salsa dancing is also done in very informal settings, such as parties in a home or backyard. Salsa dancing is often seen as an important cultural expression by persons living in certain Hispanic regions or people whose family heritage comes from those regions.

==Styles==
Over the years, many different styles of salsa dancing have evolved around the world. Many of them are compatible with each other, but others are different enough to make dancing between dancers of different styles difficult.

Salsa has many similarities with other partner dances, the styles and skills learned in salsa can be applied to another Latin dance like Bachata. Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing has also become common, with dancers of one style incorporating styles and movements of others to create new fusions of dance styles.

===New York style===
&quot;On 2&quot; style salsa originated in New York and is often referred to as New York style. It is a linear form of salsa, where dancers dance in a slot, similar to LA style salsa. Unlike other styles of salsa, however, New York style is danced on the second beat of the music (&quot;on 2&quot;), and the follower, not the leader, steps forward on the first measure of the music. There is also often a greater emphasis on performing &quot;shines&quot; in which dancers separate themselves and dance solo with intricate footwork and styling—a phenomenon that likely has origins from Swing and New York Tap.

New York style is first style of salsa to emerge following the birth of salsa music in New York, and is a mixture of Cuban dances, such as mambo, son, pachanga, and rumba as well as American dances such as swing and tap.

One of the most influential figures in New York style salsa is Eddie Torres (known as &quot;the Mambo King&quot;), who is credited with helping to formalize the on 2 salsa timing (based on mambo) and helping to popularize it by teaching it in dance studios in New York and through early instructional tapes.

New York style salsa emphasizes harmony with the percussive instruments in salsa music, such as the congas, timbales, and clave, since many or all of those instruments often mark the second beat in the music.

===Los Angeles style===


Los Angeles style salsa (LA style) is danced &quot;on 1&quot; where dancers break forward on the first beat of the music, in contrast to New York style which is danced on 2. LA style salsa is danced in a line or &quot;slot&quot; with dancers exchanging positions throughout the dance, unlike Cuban salsa which is danced in a more circular fashion.

The two essential elements of this dance are the forward–backward basic step and the cross-body lead. In this pattern, the leader steps forward on 1, steps to the right on 2–3 while turning 90 degrees counter-clockwise (facing to the left), leaving the slot open. The follower then steps straight forward on 5–6 and turns on 7–8, while the leader makes another 90 degrees counter-clockwise and slightly forward, coming back into the slot. In total, the couple turned 180° with the follower and leader switching places.

The &quot;Vazquez Brothers&quot; (Luis Vazquez, Francisco Vazquez, Johnny Vazquez and Rogelio Moreno) are credited for the early development and growth of LA Style. 

 Luiz Vazquez was the co-founder of Los Angeles&#x27;s first salsa dance team, Salsa Brava. The Vazquez Brothers drew influence from stage dances such as tap dance and helped develop LA style&#x27;s reputation for flashy moves and acrobatics.

Other prominent figures in LA style salsa include salsa promoter Albert Torres, who created the LA Salsa Congress, the first salsa congress in the United States and for many years one of the largest salsa events in the world. Later dancers such as Alex Da Silva, Christian Oviedo, and Liz Lira are also credited with developing the LA style of dancing as we know it today.

===Cuban style / Casino===

In Cuba, a popular dance known as Casino was marketed as Cuban-style salsa or Salsa Cubana abroad to distinguish it from other salsa styles when the name was popularized internationally in the 1970s. Dancing &quot;Casino&quot; is an expression of popular social culture; Cubans consider &quot;casino&quot; as part of social and cultural activities centering on their popular music. The name &quot;Casino&quot; is derived from the Spanish term for the dance halls, &quot;Casinos Deportivos&quot; where much social dancing was done among the better-off, white Cubans during the mid-20th century and onward.

Historically, &quot;Casino&quot; traces its origin as a partner dance from Cuban &quot;Son&quot;, Cha Cha Cha, Danzón and Guaracha. Traditionally, Casino is danced &quot;a contratiempo&quot;. This means that no step is taken on the first and fifth beats in each clave pattern and the fourth and eighth beat are emphasized. In this way, rather than following a beat, the dancers themselves contribute in their movement, to the polyrhythmic pattern of the music. At the same time, it is often danced &quot;a tiempo&quot;, although both &quot;on3&quot; (originally) and &quot;on1&quot; (nowadays).

What distinguishes this style is the understanding and spontaneous use of Afro-Cuban dance vocabulary within a &quot;Casino&quot; dance. In the same way that a &quot;sonero&quot; (lead singer in Son and salsa bands) will &quot;quote&quot; other, older songs in their own, a &quot;casino&quot; dancer will frequently improvise references to other dances, integrating movements, gestures and extended passages from folk dances. This is particularly true of African descended Cubans. Such improvisations might include extracts of rumba, dances for African deities, the older popular dances such as Cha Cha Chá and Danzon as well as anything the dancer may feel.

====Miami-style Casino====
Developed by Cuban immigrants to Florida and centered on Miami, this dance style is a fusion of Casino and elements from American culture and dances. The major difference that distinguishes the Miami-style from other North American styles is the &quot;Atras&quot; or &quot;Diagonal&quot;, back breaking steps performed backwards diagonally instead of moving forwards and backwards as seen in the New York style. Dancers do not shift their body weight greatly as seen in other styles. Instead, dancers keep their upper body still, poised and relaxed, focusing on foot movement. The dancer breaks mostly On1.

A major difference between Cali Style and Miami-style is the latter is exclusively danced on the downbeat (On1) and has elements of shines and show-style added to it, following repertoires of North American styles. Miami-style has many adherents, particularly Cuban-Americans and other Latinos based in South Florida.

====Rueda de Casino====

In the 1950s, Salsa Rueda or more accurately Rueda de Casino was developed in Havana, Cuba. Pairs of dancers form a circle (&quot;Rueda&quot; in Spanish means &quot;Wheel&quot;), with dance moves called out by one person. Many of the moves involve rapidly swapping partners.

&quot;Rueda de Cuba&quot; is original type of Rueda, originating from Cuba. It is not as formal as Rueda de Miami and consists of about 30 calls. It was codified in the 1970s.

&quot;Rueda de Miami&quot; originated in the 1980s from Miami, is a formal style with many rules based on a mix, and is a hybridization of Rueda de Cuba and North American dance styles, with some routines reflecting American culture (e.g. Coca-Cola, Dedo, Adios) which is not found in the traditional Cuban-style Rueda.

===Colombian / Cali style===

Cali-Style Salsa, also known as Colombian Salsa and Salsa Caleña, is based around the Colombian City of Cali. Cali is also known as the &quot;Capital de la Salsa&quot; (Salsa&#x27;s Capital); due to salsa music being the main genre in parties, nightclubs and festivals in the 21st century. It is also worth noting that Cali&#x27;s style of Salsa has been heavily influenced by the nature of its social scene, where in the 90s most nightclubs, named Disoctecas after the record discs used to play older Salsa music, had a period of time where they would transform into a Viejoteca, a nickname for point of time in which nightclubs would play the Salsa equivalent of Golden Oldies.

The elements of Cali-Style Salsa were strongly influenced by dances to Caribbean rhythms which preceded salsa, such as Pachanga and Boogaloo. Cali has the highest number of salsa schools and salsa teams in the world. Many of the competitions are held in Colombia.

The central feature is the footwork which has quick rapid steps and skipping motions called &quot;repique&quot;. Colombian style may execute Cross-body Leads or the &quot;Dile Que No&quot; as seen in other styles, but would rather step in place and displace in closed position. They include various acrobats such as partnered flips to entertain with these stunts. Their footwork is intricate and precise, helping several Colombian Style dancers win major world championships. Cali hosts many annual salsa events such as the World Salsa Cali Festival and the Encuentro de Melomanos y Coleccionistas.

== Research situated in salsa dancing ==
Academic researchers have used salsa dancing as a productive research site in the social and natural sciences. For example, researchers in the natural sciences studied the mathematics of salsa dancing moves. In the social sciences, researchers have studied salsa dancing to understand, for example how the Latino identity is connected to salsa dancing. The study of salsa dancing has been studied as a metaphor to understand emotional and cultural economies. Salsa dancing has been shown to manifest &quot;moments of luxury&quot; in which people use hedonistic escapism to leave momentarily the constrains of ordinary normal life. and, researchers have also used salsa dancing to study the ephemerality of social groups.

<text>The Great Bible of 1539 was the first authorised edition of the Bible in English, authorised by King Henry VIII of England to be read aloud in the church services of the Church of England. The Great Bible was prepared by Myles Coverdale, working under commission of Thomas Cromwell, Secretary to Henry VIII and Vicar General. In 1538, Cromwell directed the clergy to provide &quot;one book of the Bible of the largest volume in English, and the same set up in some convenient place within the said church that ye have care of, whereas your parishioners may most commodiously resort to the same and read it.&quot;

The Great Bible includes much from the Tyndale Bible, with the objectionable features revised. As the Tyndale Bible was incomplete, Coverdale translated the remaining books of the Old Testament and Apocrypha from the Latin Vulgate and German translations, rather than working from the original Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Although called the Great Bible because of its large size, it is known by several other names as well: the King&#x27;s Bible, because the King Henry VIII of England authorized and permitted it; the Cromwell Bible, since Thomas Cromwell directed its publication; Whitchurch&#x27;s Bible after its first English printer; the Chained Bible, since it was chained to prevent removal from the church. It has less accurately been termed Cranmer&#x27;s Bible, since although Thomas Cranmer was not responsible for the translation, a preface by him appeared in the second edition.

==Sources and history==
The Tyndale New Testament had been published in 1525, followed by his English version of the Pentateuch in 1530; but both employed vocabulary, and appended notes, that were unacceptable to English churchmen, and to the King. Tyndale&#x27;s books were banned by royal proclamation in 1530, and Henry then held out the promise of an officially authorised English Bible being prepared by learned and catholic scholars. In 1534, Thomas Cranmer sought to advance the King&#x27;s project by press-ganging ten diocesan bishops to collaborate on an English New Testament, but most delivered their draft portions late, inadequately, or not at all. By 1537 Cranmer was saying that the proposed Bishops&#x27; Bible would not be completed until the day after Doomsday.

The King was becoming impatient with the slow progress, especially in view of his conviction that the Pilgrimage of Grace had been substantially exacerbated due to the rebels&#x27; exploitation of popular religious ignorance. With the bishops showing no signs of completing their task, Cromwell obtained official approval for the Matthew Bible as an interim measure in 1537, the year of its publication under the pseudonym &quot;Thomas Matthew&quot;, actually John Rogers. Cromwell had helped to fund the printing of this version. The Matthew Bible combined the New Testament of William Tyndale, and as much of the Old Testament as Tyndale had been able to translate before being put to death the prior year for heresy.

Coverdale&#x27;s translation of the Bible from the Latin into English and Matthew&#x27;s translation of the Bible using much of Tyndale&#x27;s work were each licensed for printing by Henry VIII, but neither was fully accepted by the Church.

By 1538, it became compulsory for all churches to own a Bible in accordance with Cromwell&#x27;s Injunctions to the Clergy.

Coverdale based the Great Bible on Tyndale&#x27;s work, but removed the features objectionable to the bishops. He translated the remaining books of the Old Testament using mostly the Latin Vulgate and German translations. Coverdale&#x27;s failure to translate from the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts gave impetus to the &quot;Bishops&#x27; Bible&quot;.

The Great Bible&#x27;s New Testament revision is chiefly distinguished from Tyndale&#x27;s source version by the interpolation of numerous phrases and sentences found only in the Vulgate. For example, here is the Great Bible&#x27;s version of (as given in &quot;The New Testament Octapla&quot;):


The non-italicised portions are taken over from Tyndale without change, but the italicised words, which are not found in the Greek text translated by Tyndale, have been added from the Latin. (The added sentence can also be found, with minor verbal differences, in the Douai-Rheims New Testament.) These inclusions appear to have been done to make the Great Bible more palatable to conservative English churchmen, many of whom considered the Vulgate to be the only legitimate Bible.

The psalms in the Book of Common Prayer of 1662 continue to be taken from the Great Bible rather than the King James Bible.

In 1568, the Great Bible was superseded as the authorised version of the Anglican Church by the Bishops&#x27; Bible. The last of over 30 editions of the Great Bible appeared in 1569.

==Printing==
Myles Coverdale and Richard Grafton went over to Paris and put the work into the hands of the French printer, François Regnault at the University of Paris, with the countenance of Bonner, then (Bishop Elect of Hereford and) British Ambassador at Paris. There was constant fear of the Inquisition. Coverdale packed off a large quantity of the finished work through Bonner to Cromwell, and just when this was done, the officers of the Inquisition came on the scene. Coverdale and Grafton made their escape. A large quantity of the printed sheets were sold as waste paper to a haberdasher, who resold them to Cromwell&#x27;s agents, and they were, in due course, sent over to London. Cromwell bought the type and presses from Regnault and secured the services of his compositors.

The first edition was a run of 2,500 copies that were begun in Paris in 1539. Much of the printing – in fact 60 percent – was done at Paris, and after some misadventures where the printed sheets were seized by the French authorities on grounds of heresy (since relations between England and France were somewhat troubled at this time), the remaining 40 percent of the publication was completed in London in April 1539.&lt;br&gt;

Two luxurious editions were printed to showcase for presentation. One edition was produced for King Henry VIII and the other for Thomas Cromwell. Each was printed on parchment rather than on paper. The woodcut illustrations of these editions, moreover, were then exquisitely painted by hand to look like illuminations. Today, the copy that was owned by King Henry VIII is held by the British Library in London, England. Thomas Cromwell&#x27;s edition is today held by the Old Library at St John&#x27;s College in Cambridge, England.&lt;br&gt;

It went through six subsequent revisions between 1540 and 1541. The second edition of 1540 included a preface by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, recommending the reading of the scriptures. (Cranmer&#x27;s preface was also included in the front of the Bishops&#x27; Bible.)

Seven editions of the Great Bible were published in quick succession.

1. 1539, April – Printed in Paris and London by Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch.&lt;br&gt;
2. 1540, April – Printed in London by Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch, includes Archbishop Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s preface, and the Apocryphal Books were interspersed among the Canonical Books of the Old Testament.&lt;br&gt;
3. 1540, July – Printed in London by Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch, includes Archbishop Cranmer&#x27;s preface with Cromwell&#x27;s shield defaced on the title page&lt;br&gt;
4. 1540, November — Printed in London by Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch, with the title page of 1541, and includes Archbishop Cranmer&#x27;s preface..&lt;br&gt;
5. 1541, May – Printed in London by Edward Whitchurch, includes Archbishop Cranmer&#x27;s preface.&lt;br&gt;
6. 1541, November – Printed in London by Edward Whitchurch, includes Archbishop Cranmer&#x27;s preface.&lt;br&gt;
7. 1541, December – Printed in London by Edward Whitchurch, includes Archbishop Cranmer&#x27;s preface.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
More than 9,000 copies of the Great Bible were printed by 1541.

8. 1549, ________ – Printed in London by Edward Whitchurch.

9. &quot;In 1568, the Great Bible was superseded as the authorised version of the Anglican Church by the Bishops&#x27; Bible. The last of over 30 editions of the Great Bible appeared in 1569.&quot;

A version of Cranmer&#x27;s Great Bible can be found included in the English Hexapla, produced by Samuel Baxter and Sons in 1841. However copies of this work are fairly rare.

The most available reprinting of the Great Bible&#x27;s New Testament (minus its marginal notes) can be found in the second column of the &quot;New Testament Octapla&quot; edited by Luther Weigle, chairman of the translation committee that produced the Revised Standard Version.

==Language==
The language of the Great Bible marks the advent of Early Modern English. Moreover, this variant of English is pre-Elizabethan. The text, which was regularly read in the parish churches, helped to standardise and stabilise the language across England. Some of the readings of the First Authorised Version of the Bible differ from the more familiar 1611 edition, the Third Authorised Version. For example, the commandment against adultery in the Great Bible reads, &quot;Thou shalt not breake wedlocke.&quot;

==Illustrations==
The woodcut illustrations in the earlier editions of the Great Bible evidence a lack of projective geometry in their designs. Though this Bible falls into the Renaissance period of Bible production in the early years of the Protestant Reformation of church theology and religious practice, the artwork used in the Great Byble more closely resembles the woodcut illustrations found in a typical Biblia pauperum from the medieval period. The woodcut designs appear in the 1545 edition of &quot;Le Premier [-second] volume de la Bible en francoiz nouvellement hystoriee, reveue &amp; corrigee oultre les precedentes impressions&quot; published in Paris by Guillaume Le Bret, and now held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France, département Réserve des livres rares, A-282. &quot; The style employed by the French woodcutter appears to have been influenced by the Venetian engraver Giovanni Andrea Valvassori, who in 1511 produced the block print picture bible &quot;Opera nova contemplativa&quot;. In 2020, it was discovered that the illustrations in Henry VIII&#x27;s personal copy had been altered to appeal to the king.

==Aftermath==
The later years of Henry VIII were marked by serious reaction. In 1542 Convocation with the royal consent made an attempt thwarted by Cranmer to Latinise the English version and to make it in reality what the Catholic version of Rheims subsequently became. In the following year Parliament (which then practically meant the King and two or three members of the Privy Council) restricted the use of the English Bible to certain social classes – excluding nine tenths of the population. Three years later it would prohibit the use of everything but the Great Bible. It was probably at this time that there took place the great destruction of all previous work on the English Bible which has rendered examples of that work so scarce. Even Tunstall and Heath were anxious to escape from their responsibility in lending their names to the Great Bible. In the midst of this reaction Henry VIII died on 28 January 1547.

<text>Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. Thirty species of clownfish are recognized: one in the genus &quot;Premnas&quot;, while the remaining are in the genus &quot;Amphiprion&quot;. In the wild, they all form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones. Depending on the species, anemonefish are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. The largest can reach a length of , while the smallest barely achieve .

==Distribution and habitat==
Anemonefish are endemic to the warmer waters of the Indian Ocean, including the Red Sea, and Pacific Ocean, the Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii, USA, North America, Southeast Asia, Japan, and the Indo-Malaysian region. While most species have restricted distributions, others are widespread. Anemonefish typically live at the bottom of shallow seas in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. No anemonefish are found in the Atlantic.

==Diet==

Anemonefish are omnivorous and can feed on undigested food from their host anemones, and the fecal matter from the anemonefish provides nutrients to the sea anemone. Anemonefish primarily feed on small zooplankton from the water column, such as copepods and tunicate larvae, with a small portion of their diet coming from algae, with the exception of &quot;Amphiprion perideraion&quot;, which primarily feeds on algae.

== Symbiosis and mutualism ==
Anemonefish and sea anemones have a symbiotic, mutualistic relationship, each providing many benefits to the other. The individual species are generally highly host specific. The sea anemone protects the anemonefish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone&#x27;s meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles, and functions as a safe nest site. In return, the anemonefish defends the anemone from its predators and parasites. The anemone also picks up nutrients from the anemonefish&#x27;s excrement. The nitrogen excreted from anemonefish increases the number of algae incorporated into the tissue of their hosts, which aids the anemone in tissue growth and regeneration. The activity of the anemonefish results in greater water circulation around the sea anemone, and it has been suggested that their bright coloring might lure small fish to the anemone, which then catches them. Studies on anemonefish have found that they alter the flow of water around sea anemone tentacles by certain behaviors and movements such as &quot;wedging&quot; and &quot;switching&quot;. Aeration of the host anemone tentacles allows for benefits to the metabolism of both partners, mainly by increasing anemone body size and both anemonefish and anemone respiration.

Bleaching of the host anemone can occur when warm temperatures cause a reduction in algal symbionts within the anemone. Bleaching of the host can cause a short-term increase in the metabolic rate of resident anemonefish, probably as a result of acute stress. Over time, however, there appears to be a down-regulation of metabolism and a reduced growth rate for fish associated with bleached anemones. These effects may stem from reduced food availability (e.g. anemone waste products, symbiotic algae) for the anemonefish.

Several theories are given about how they can survive the sea anemone venom:

* The mucus coating of the fish may be based on sugars rather than proteins. This would mean that anemones fail to recognize the fish as a potential food source and do not fire their nematocysts, or sting organelles.
* The coevolution of certain species of anemonefish with specific anemone host species may have allowed the fish to evolve an immunity to the nematocysts and toxins of their hosts. &quot;Amphiprion percula&quot; may develop resistance to the toxin from &quot;Heteractis magnifica&quot;, but it is not totally protected since it was shown experimentally to die when its skin, devoid of mucus, was exposed to the nematocysts of its host.

Anemonefish are the best known example of fish that are able to live among the venomous sea anemone tentacles, but several others occur, including juvenile threespot dascyllus, certain cardinalfish (such as Banggai cardinalfish), incognito (or anemone) goby, and juvenile painted greenling.

==Reproduction==

In a group of anemonefish, a strict dominance hierarchy exists. The largest and most aggressive female is found at the top. Only two anemonefish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce – through external fertilization. Anemonefish are protandrous sequential hermaphrodites, meaning they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. If the female anemonefish is removed from the group, such as by death, one of the largest and most dominant males becomes a female. The remaining males move up a rank in the hierarchy. Clownfish live in a hierarchy, like hyenas, except smaller and based on size not sex, and order of joining/birth.

Anemonefish lay eggs on any flat surface close to their host anemones. In the wild, anemonefish spawn around the time of the full moon. Depending on the species, they can lay hundreds or thousands of eggs. The male parent guards the eggs until they hatch about 6–10 days later, typically two hours after dusk.

==Parental investment==

Anemonefish colonies usually consist of the reproductive male and female and a few male juveniles, which help tend the colony. Although multiple males cohabit an environment with a single female, polygamy does not occur and only the adult pair exhibits reproductive behavior. However, if the female dies, the social hierarchy shifts with the breeding male exhibiting protandrous sex reversal to become the breeding female. The largest juvenile then becomes the new breeding male after a period of rapid growth. The existence of protandry in anemonefish may rest on the case that nonbreeders modulate their phenotype in a way that causes breeders to tolerate them. This strategy prevents conflict by reducing competition between males for one female. For example, by purposefully modifying their growth rate to remain small and submissive, the juveniles in a colony present no threat to the fitness of the adult male, thereby protecting themselves from being evicted by the dominant fish.The reproductive cycle of anemonefish is often correlated with the lunar cycle. Rates of spawning for anemonefish peak around the first and third quarters of the moon. The timing of this spawn means that the eggs hatch around the full moon or new moon periods. One explanation for this lunar clock is that spring tides produce the highest tides during full or new moons. Nocturnal hatching during high tide may reduce predation by allowing for a greater capacity for escape. Namely, the stronger currents and greater water volume during high tide protect the hatchlings by effectively sweeping them to safety. Before spawning, anemonefish exhibit increased rates of anemone and substrate biting, which help prepare and clean the nest for the spawn.

Before making the clutch, the parents often clear an oval-shaped clutch varying in diameter for the spawn. Fecundity, or reproductive rate, of the females, usually ranges from 600 to 1,500 eggs depending on her size. In contrast to most animal species, the female only occasionally takes responsibility for the eggs, with males expending most of the time and effort. Male anemonefish care for their eggs by fanning and guarding them for 6 to 10 days until they hatch. In general, eggs develop more rapidly in a clutch when males fan properly, and fanning represents a crucial mechanism for successfully developing eggs. This suggests that males can control the success of hatching an egg clutch by investing different amounts of time and energy toward the eggs. For example, a male could choose to fan less in times of scarcity or fan more in times of abundance. Furthermore, males display increased alertness when guarding more valuable broods, or eggs in which paternity is guaranteed. Females, though, display generally less preference for parental behavior than males. All these suggest that males have increased parental investment towards eggs compared to females.

Clownfish hatchlings undergo development after hatching in regards to both their body size and fins. If maintained at the demanded thermal regulation, clownfish undergo proper development of their fins. Clownfish follow the ensuing order in their fin development &quot;Pectorals &lt; caudal &lt; dorsal = anal &lt; pelvic&quot;. The early larval stage is crucial to ensure a healthy progression of growth.

==Taxonomy ==
Historically, anemonefish have been identified by morphological features and color pattern in the field, while in a laboratory, other features such as scalation of the head, tooth shape, and body proportions are used. These features have been used to group species into six complexes: percula, tomato, skunk, clarkii, saddleback, and maroon. As can be seen from the gallery, each of the fish in these complexes has a similar appearance. Genetic analysis has shown that these complexes are not monophyletic groups, particularly the 11 species in the &quot;A. clarkii&quot; group, where only &quot;A. clarkii&quot; and &quot;A. tricintus&quot; are in the same clade, with six species,&quot;A . allardi&quot; &quot;A. bicinctus&quot;, &quot;A. chagosensis&quot;, &quot;A. chrosgaster&quot;, &quot;A. fuscocaudatus&quot;, &quot;A. latifasciatus&quot;, and &quot;A. omanensis&quot; being in an Indian clade, &quot;A. chrysopterus&quot; having monospecific lineage, and &quot;A. akindynos&quot; in the Australian clade with &quot;A. mccullochi&quot;. Other significant differences are that &quot;A. latezonatus&quot; also has monospecific lineage, and &quot;A. nigripes&quot; is in the Indian clade rather than with &quot;A. akallopisos&quot;, the skunk anemonefish. &quot;A. latezonatus&quot; is more closely related to &quot;A. percula&quot; and &quot;Premnas biaculeatus&quot; than to the saddleback fish with which it was previously grouped.

Obligate mutualism was thought to be the key innovation that allowed anemonefish to radiate rapidly, with rapid and convergent morphological changes correlated with the ecological niches offered by the host anemones. The complexity of mitochondrial DNA structure shown by genetic analysis of the Australian clade suggested evolutionary connectivity among samples of &quot;A. akindynos&quot; and &quot;A. mccullochi&quot; that the authors theorize was the result of historical hybridization and introgression in the evolutionary past. The two evolutionary groups had individuals of both species detected, thus the species lacked reciprocal monophyly. No shared haplotypes were found between species.

===Morphological diversity by complex===
==In the aquarium==
Anemonefish make up approximately 43% of the global marine ornamental trade, and approximately 25% of the global trade comes from fish bred in captivity, while the majority is captured from the wild, accounting for decreased densities in exploited areas. Public aquaria and captive-breeding programs are essential to sustain their trade as marine ornamentals, and has recently become economically feasible. It is one of a handful of marine ornamentals whose complete lifecycle has been in closed captivity. Members of some anemonefish species, such as the maroon clownfish, become aggressive in captivity; others, like the false percula clownfish, can be kept successfully with other individuals of the same species.

When a sea anemone is not available in an aquarium, the anemonefish may settle in some varieties of soft corals, or large polyp stony corals. Once an anemone or coral has been adopted, the anemonefish will defend it. Anemonefish, however, are not obligately tied to hosts, and can survive alone in captivity.

Clownfish sold from captivity make up a very small account (10%) of the total trade of these fishes. Designer Clownfish, scientifically named A. ocellaris are much costlier and obtaining them has disrupted their coral reefs. Their attractive allure, color, and patterning have made them out to be an attractive target in wild trading.

==In popular culture==

In Disney Pixar&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; and its 2016 sequel &quot;Finding Dory&quot; main characters Nemo, his father Marlin, and his mother Coral are clownfish from the species &quot;A. ocellaris&quot;. The popularity of anemonefish for aquaria increased following the film&#x27;s release; it is the first film associated with an increase in the numbers of those captured in the wild.

<text>Marine angelfish are perciform fish of the family Pomacanthidae. They are found on shallow reefs in the tropical Atlantic, Indian, and mostly western Pacific Oceans. The family contains seven genera and about 86 species. They should not be confused with the freshwater angelfish, tropical cichlids of the Amazon Basin.

==Description==

With their bright colours and deep, laterally compressed bodies, marine angelfishes are some of the more conspicuous residents of the reef. They most closely resemble the butterflyfishes, a related family of similarly showy reef fish. Marine angelfish are distinguished from butterflyfish by the presence of strong preopercle spines (part of the gill covers) in the former. This feature also explains the family name Pomacanthidae; from the Greek πομα, &quot;poma&quot; meaning &quot;cover&quot; and ακάνθα, &quot;akantha&quot; meaning &quot;thorn&quot;.

Many species of marine angelfishes have streamer-like extensions of the soft dorsal and anal fins. The fish have small mouths, relatively large pectoral fins, and rounded to lunate tail fins. The largest species, the gray angelfish, &quot;Pomacanthus arcuatus&quot;, may reach a length of ; at the other extreme, members of the genus &quot;Centropyge&quot; do not exceed . A length of is typical for the rest of the family. The smaller species are popular amongst aquarists, whereas the largest species are occasionally sought as a food fish; however, ciguatera poisoning has been reported as a result of eating marine angelfish.

Angelfish vary in color and are very hardy fish. When kept in aquariums they can easily adapt to pH and hardness changes in water and can handle conditions that are not considered to be perfect. They are usually a long-living species and are easy to care for. They were very expensive in the aquarium trade when first discovered, but have become more popular and therefore less pricey.

The queen angelfish grows to be . With neon blue and yellow scales and iridescent purple and orange markings, surprisingly it is not conspicuous, and actually hides very well, and is very shy.

As juveniles, some species are different colors than when they reach adulthood. For example, the Blue Angelfish is a vibrant, electric blue color with black and white stripes or spots. When they reach adulthood, they turn a grayish color with yellow and blue fins and dark spots on their bodies.

==Behavior==
The larger species are also quite bold and seemingly fearless; they are known to approach divers. While the majority adapts easily to captive life, some are specialist feeders which are difficult to maintain. Feeding habits can be strictly defined through genus, with &quot;Genicanthus&quot; species feeding on zooplankton and &quot;Centropyge&quot; preferring filamentous algae. Other species focus on sessile benthic invertebrates; sponges, tunicates, bryozoans, and hydroids are staples. On Caribbean coral reefs, angelfishes primarily eat sponges, and have an important role in preventing the overgrowth of reef-building corals by eating faster-growing sponge species.

Most marine angelfishes restrict themselves to the shallows of the reef, seldom venturing deeper than . The recently described &quot;Centropyge abei&quot; is known to inhabit depths of . They are diurnal animals, hiding amongst the nooks and crevices of the reef by night. Some species are solitary in nature and form highly territorial mated pairs; others form harems with a single male dominant over several females. As juveniles, some species may eke out a living as cleaner fish.

===Reproduction===
Common to many species is a dramatic shift in coloration associated with maturity. For example, young male ornate angelfish, &quot;Genicanthus bellus&quot;, have broad, black bands and are indistinguishable from females; as they mature, bright orange bands develop on the flanks and back. Thought to correspond to social rank, these colour shifts are not necessarily confined to males; all marine angelfish species are known to be protogynous hermaphrodites. This means that if the dominant male of a harem is removed, a female will turn into a functional male.

As pelagic spawners, marine angelfishes release many tiny buoyant eggs into the water which then become part of the plankton. The eggs float freely with the currents until hatching, with a high number falling victim to planktonic feeders.

In aquariums, two fish usually will breed within their community but will harass other fish in the tank, so it is best they have their own with plenty of room.

== Taxonomy ==
The Pomacanthidae is frequently placed within the large order Perciformes but taxonomists have also placed the family within the order Acanthuriformes, alongside the Chaetodontidae and Acanthuridae, among others. Other authorities have resolved the family as &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.

There are 88 species in eight genera: 

The more speciose genera are, generally speaking, widely distributed, however some species, especially of the Centropyge genus, are range restricted or endemic to specific islands or small island groups.

<text>Uxmal (Yucatec Maya: &quot;Óoxmáal&quot; ) is an ancient Maya city of the classical period located in present-day Mexico. It is considered one of the most important archaeological sites of Maya culture, along with Palenque, Chichen Itza and Calakmul in Mexico, Caracol and Xunantunich in Belize, and Tikal in Guatemala. It is located in the Puuc region of the western Yucatán Peninsula, and is considered one of the Maya cities most representative of the region&#x27;s dominant architectural style. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the nearby ruins of Kabah, Sayil and Labna.

Uxmal is located 62 km south of Mérida, capital of Yucatán state in Mexico. Its buildings are noted for their size and decoration. Ancient roads called &quot;sacbes&quot; connect the buildings, and also were built to other cities in the area such as Chichén Itzá in modern-day Mexico, Caracol and Xunantunich in modern-day Belize, and Tikal in modern-day Guatemala.

Its buildings are typical of the Puuc style, with smooth low walls that open on ornate friezes based on representations of typical Maya huts. These are represented by columns (representing the reeds used for the walls of the huts) and trapezoidal shapes (representing the thatched roofs). Entwined snakes and, in many cases two-headed snakes are used for masks of the rain god, &quot;Chaac;&quot; its big noses represent the rays of the storms. Feathered serpents with open fangs are shown leaving from the same human beings. Also seen in some cities are the influences of the Nahua peoples, who followed the cult of &quot;Quetzalcoatl&quot; and &quot;Tlaloc.&quot; These were integrated with the original elements of the Puuc tradition.

The buildings take advantage of the terrain to gain height and acquire important volumes, including the Pyramid of the Magician, with five levels, and the Governor&#x27;s Palace, which covers an area of more than .

== Toponymy ==
The present name seems to derive from &quot;Oxmal,&quot; meaning &quot;three times built.&quot; This seems to refer to the site&#x27;s antiquity and the times it had to rebuild. The etymology is disputed; another possibility is &quot;Uchmal&quot; which means &quot;what is to come, the future.&quot; By tradition, this was supposed to be an &quot;invisible city,&quot; built in one night by the magic of the dwarf king.


== Description of the site ==

Some of the more noteworthy buildings include:
* The Governor&#x27;s Palace, a long low building atop a huge platform, with the longest façades in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica.
:With an approximate azimuth of 118°, the building is oriented to the main pyramid of Cehtzuc, a small site located nearly 5 km to the southeast. Observing from there, Venus as evening star, when reaching its maximum northerly extremes, would have set behind the northern edge of the Governor&#x27;s Palace. Since these events occur every eight years, always in late April or early May, heralding the onset of the rainy season, it is significant that the decoration of the building&#x27;s facade contains almost 400 Venus glyphs placed in the masks of the rain god Chac, and that there are eight bicephalic serpents above the main entrance; additionally, numerals 8 in bar-and-dot notation appear on two Chac masks at the northern corners of the palace.

* The Adivino (a.k.a. the Pyramid of the Magician or the Pyramid of the Dwarf), is a stepped pyramid structure, unusual among Maya structures in that its layers&#x27; outlines are oval or elliptical in shape, instead of the more common rectilinear plan. It was a common practice in Mesoamerica to build new temple pyramids atop older ones, but here a newer pyramid was built centered slightly to the east of the older pyramid, so that on the west side the temple atop the old pyramid is preserved, with the newer temple above it.

The structure is featured in one of the best-known tales of Yucatec Maya folklore, &quot;el enano del Uxmal&quot; (&quot;the dwarf of Uxmal&quot;), which is also the basis for the structure&#x27;s common name. Multiple versions of this tale are recorded. It was popularised after one of these was recounted by John Lloyd Stephens in his influential 1841 book, &quot;Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatán&quot;. According to Stephens&#x27; version, the pyramid was magically built overnight during a series of challenges issued to a dwarf by the &quot;gobernador&quot; (ruler or king) of Uxmal. The dwarf&#x27;s mother (a &quot;bruja&quot;, or witch) arranged the trial of strength and magic to compete against the king.
* The Nunnery Quadrangle was built from 900-1000, and the name related with nuns was assigned in the 16th century because it resembled a convent. The quadrangle consists of four palaces placed on different levels that surround a courtyard. Of the different buildings that make up this palatial complex, several vault tops have been recovered, they are painted and represent partial calendrical dates from 906 to 907 AD, which is consistent with the Chan Chahk’ahk Nalajaw period of government. The formal entrance, the hierarchy of the structures through the different elevations, and the absence of domestic elements suggest that this space corresponds to a royal palace with administrative and non-residential functions, where the ruling group must have had meetings to collect the tribute, make decisions, and dictate sentences among other activities. These set of buildings are the finest of Uxmal&#x27;s several fine quadrangles of long buildings. It has elaborately carved façades on both the inside and outside faces.
* A large Ballcourt for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame. Its inscription says that it was dedicated in 901 by the ruler &quot;Chan Chak K&#x27;ak&#x27;nal Ajaw,&quot; also known as Lord Chac (before the decipherment of his corresponding name glyphs). The ball court&#x27;s condition is very deteriorated, and it’s made of two constructions of medium dimensions that make up the sides of the court with the rings by which the ball was to be introduced. The originally carved stone rings were removed to protect them from the elements and were replaced by reproductions. This game has always been related to mythical and cosmic aspects. The ball symbolized the movements of the stars in the sky and the players, in repeated occasions, symbolically staged the fight of the day against the night or the struggle of the deities of the underworld against the gods of heaven.

== Modern history of the ruins ==

Sylvanus G. Morley made a map of the site in 1909 which included some previously overlooked buildings. The Mexican government&#x27;s first project to protect some of the structures from risk of collapse or further decay came in 1927. In 1930 Frans Blom led a Tulane University expedition to the site. They made plaster casts of the façades of the &quot;Nunnery Quadrangle&quot;; using these casts, a replica of the Quadrangle was constructed and displayed at the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, Illinois. The plaster replicas of the architecture were destroyed following the fair, but some of the plaster casts of Uxmal&#x27;s monuments are still kept at Tulane&#x27;s Middle American Research Institute. In 1936 a Mexican government repair and consolidation program was begun under José Erosa Peniche.

Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited on 27 February 1975 for the inauguration of the site&#x27;s sound &amp; light show. When the presentation reached the point where the sound system played the Maya prayer to Chaac (the Maya rain deity), a sudden torrential downpour occurred.

== Microbial degradation ==

Microbial biofilms have been found degrading stone buildings at Uxmal and Kabah. Phototrophs such as &quot;Xenococcus&quot; are found more often on interior walls. Stone degrading &quot;Gloeocapsa&quot; and &quot;Synechocystis&quot; were also present in large numbers.
&quot;Aureobasidium&quot; and &quot;Fusarium&quot; fungi species are present at Chichen Itza and Uxmal. Cyanobacteria were prevalent in the interiors of rooms with low light levels.

<text>Bill Woodrow (born 1 November 1948) is a British sculptor.

==Early years and education==
Bill Woodrow was born on 1 November 1948 near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. He received his education at the Winchester College of Art (1967–1968), the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London (1968–1971), and the Chelsea School of Art (1971–1972).

==Artistic career==

Woodrow was one of a number of British sculptors to emerge in the late 1970s on to the international contemporary art scene, together with fellow artists like Richard Deacon and Tony Cragg. Materials found in dumps, used car lots and scrap yards formed the raw materials for his early works; by partly embedding them in plaster, he made them seem as if they had been excavated. Subsequently, he turned to large consumer goods like cars and refrigerators. While their original structures could still be discerned, he cut portions out of them and reattached the portions to the main structures so that they appeared to be connected through umbilical cords. He held his first solo exhibition at Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in 1972.

Woodrow&#x27;s works often featured a narrative element, and in the 1990s when he began to make work in bronze, stories remained an important element of his sculptures. A seminal work was &quot;In Awe of the Pawnbroker&quot; (1994), in which the meaning of the pawnbroker&#x27;s symbol was unravelled. This sculpture has a number of elements that add up to what is virtually an installation. One of three artists selected to make a sculpture for the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square, London, in 2000, Woodrow chose to explore a recurring theme in his work – the destruction of the planet and the insistent strength of nature over man – in the piece entitled &quot;Regardless of History&quot;.

==Major exhibitions==

Important solo shows by Woodrow include the XXI São Paulo Art Biennial (Brazil, 1991); &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot;, an exhibition of bronze sculptures at the Tate Modern (London, UK, 1996); and &quot;Bee Keeper&quot; at the South London Gallery (2001). Several exhibitions at the Royal Academy of Arts in London have featured his works, including &quot;Earth: Art of a Changing World&quot; (2009) and &quot;Modern British Sculpture&quot; (2011). Between 30 March and 29 September 2013, Woodrow curated the exhibition &quot;Here, There and Somewhere in Between&quot; at Hatfield House in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. A joint project between the historic country house and the Royal Academy, the show included Woodrow&#x27;s piece &quot;Endeavour: Cannon Dredged from the First Wreck of the Ship of Fools&quot; as well as works by Michael Craig-Martin, Richard Deacon and Gary Hume. A major retrospective of his work was held at the Royal Academy between 7 November 2013 and 16 February 2014.

==Awards and honours==
Woodrow was a finalist for the Turner Prize in 1986, and was elected a Royal Academician in the sculpture category in May 2002.

<doc id="176349" wikidata="Q3530947" url="?curid=176349" title="Tom Van Flandern">
<text>Thomas Charles Van Flandern (June 26, 1940 – January 9, 2009) was an American astronomer and author who specialized in celestial mechanics. Van Flandern had a career as a professional scientist but was noted as an outspoken proponent of certain fringe views in astronomy, physics, and extraterrestrial life. He also published the non-mainstream &quot;Meta Research Bulletin&quot;.

== Biography ==
Tom Van Flandern was the first child of Robert F. Van Flandern, a police officer, and Anna Mary Haley. His father left the family when Tom was 5. His mother died when he was 16; he and his siblings then lived with their grandmother, Margery Jobe, until he went to college. He graduated from Saint Ignatius High School in Cleveland. While there, he helped start the Cleveland branch of Operation Moonwatch, an amateur science program initiated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to track satellites. He also helped found a Moonwatchers team while studying at Xavier University; this team broke a tracking record in 1961.

Van Flandern graduated from Xavier University with a B.S. in mathematics (&quot;cum laude&quot;) in 1962 and was awarded a teaching fellowship at Georgetown University. He attended Yale University on a scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO), joining USNO in 1963. In 1969, he received a Ph.D. in astronomy from Yale after completing his dissertation on lunar occultations.

Van Flandern worked at the USNO until 1983, first becoming Chief of the Research Branch and later becoming Chief of the Celestial Mechanics Branch of the Nautical Almanac Office. His espousal of highly non-mainstream beliefs, particularly the exploded planet hypothesis, eventually led to his separation from the USNO. He later said, &quot;This forced me to the &#x27;fringes,&#x27; areas of astronomy not accepted as credible by experts of the field&quot;.

Following his separation from the USNO, Van Flandern started a business organizing eclipse-viewing expeditions and promoting his non-mainstream views in a newsletter and website. Shortly after he died in 2009, the asteroid 52266 Van Flandern was named in his honor because of his prediction and analysis of lunar occultations at the U.S. Naval Observatory and publications of papers on the dynamics of binary minor planets.

He married Barbara Ann Weber (1942-2018) in 1963 in Kentucky, and they had three sons, Michael, Brian, and Kevin, and a daughter, Connie. The couple moved to Sequim, Washington, from the East Coast in 2005 to be closer to their children and grandchildren.

Tom Van Flandern died of colon cancer in Seattle, Washington.

== Mainstream scientific work ==

During the mid-1970s, Van Flandern believed that lunar observations gave evidence of variation in Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant (&quot;G&quot;), consistent with a speculative idea that had been put forward by Paul Dirac. In 1974, his essay &quot;A Determination of the Rate of Change of G&quot; was awarded second place by the Gravity Research Foundation.
However, in later years, with new data available, Van Flandern himself admitted his findings were flawed and contradicted by more accurate findings based on radio measurements with the Viking landers.

Van Flandern and Henry Fliegel developed a compact algorithm to calculate a Julian date from a Gregorian date that would fit on a single IBM card. They described this in a letter to the editor of a computing magazine in 1968. This was available for use in business applications.

With Kenneth Pulkkinen, he published &quot;Low precision formulae for planetary positions&quot; in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement in 1979. The paper set a record for the number of reprints requested from that journal.

Following claims by David Dunham in 1978 to have detected satellites for some asteroids (notably 532 Herculina) by examining the light patterns during stellar occultations, Van Flandern and others began to report similar observations. His non-mainstream 1978 prediction that some asteroids have natural satellites, which was almost universally rejected at the time, was later proven correct when the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft photographed Dactyl, a satellite of 243 Ida, during its flyby in 1993.

== Non-mainstream science and beliefs ==
Van Flandern described in his 1993 book &quot;Dark Matter, Missing Planets, New Comets&quot; how he had become increasingly dissatisfied with the mainstream views of science by the early 1980s. He wrote:

::&quot;Events in my life caused me to start questioning my goals and the correctness of everything I had learned. In matters of religion, medicine, biology, physics, and other fields, I came to discover that reality differed seriously from what I had been taught.&quot;

In his book, on blogs, lectures, newsletters, and websites, Van Flandern focused on problems in cosmology and physics. He alleged that when experimental evidence is incompatible with mainstream scientific theories, mainstream scientists refuse to acknowledge this to avoid jeopardizing their funding.

=== Exploding planets ===
In 1976, while Van Flandern worked for the USNO, he began to promote the belief that major planets sometimes explode. Van Flandern also speculated that the origin of the human species may well have been on the planet Mars, which he believed was once a moon of a now-exploded &quot;Planet V&quot;.

=== Le Sage&#x27;s theory of gravitation and the speed of gravity ===
Van Flandern supported Georges-Louis Le Sage&#x27;s theory of gravitation, according to which gravity is the result of a flux of invisible &quot;ultra-mundane corpuscles&quot; impinging on all objects from all directions at superluminal speeds. He gave public lectures in which he claimed that these particles could be used as a limitless source of free energy and to provide superluminal propulsion for spacecraft.

In 1998 Van Flandern wrote a paper asserting that astronomical observations imply that gravity propagates at least twenty billion times faster than light, or even infinitely fast. Gerald E. Marsh, Charles Nissim-Sabat and Steve Carlip demonstrated that Van Flandern&#x27;s argument was fallacious.

=== Face on Mars ===
Van Flandern was a prominent advocate of the belief that certain geological features seen on Mars, especially the &quot;face at Cydonia&quot;, are not of natural origin but were produced by intelligent extraterrestrial life, probably the inhabitants of a major planet once located where the asteroid belt presently exists, and which Van Flandern believed had exploded 3.2 million years ago. The claimed artificiality of the &quot;face&quot; was also the topic of a chapter of his 1993 book.

=== Rejection of Big Bang cosmology ===
Van Flandern was a vocal opponent of the Big Bang model in cosmology and believed in a static universe instead. In 2008, he organized the &quot;Crisis in Cosmology&quot;; a conference of individuals who opposed the Big Bang cosmological models.

<text>In photography and cinematography, a normal lens is a lens that reproduces a field of view that appears &quot;natural&quot; to a human observer. In contrast, depth compression and expansion with shorter or longer focal lengths introduces noticeable, and sometimes disturbing, distortion.

== Mimicking human vision ==
Photographic technology employs different physical methods from the human eye in order to capture images. Thus, manufacturing optics which produce images that appear natural to human vision is problematic.

The eye has a nominal focal length of approximately 17 mm, but it varies with accommodation. The nature of human binocular vision, which uses two lenses instead of a single one, and post-processing by the cortex is very different from the process of making and rendering a photograph, video or film, and then looking at those.

The structure of the human eye has a concave retina, rather than a flat sensor. This produces effects observed by Abraham Bosse who, in his 1665 illustration &quot;To prove that one can neither define nor paint as the eye sees&quot;, demonstrated how the circular projection of the visual cone conflicts with the flat plane of the picture surface, prompting continued debate over whether straight lines in the world are perceived as straight or curved in a form of barrel distortion, and whether they should be depicted as straight in the picture plane.

Hermann von Helmholtz&#x27;s pin-cushioned chessboard figure demonstrates that straight lines in the world are not always perceived as straight and, conversely, that curved lines in the world can sometimes be seen as straight. Furthermore, the retina has variable sensitivity across its wider-than-180° horizontal field of view, as well as differences in resolution between peripheral and foveal vision.

Given these differences between human vision and camera lenses, explanations in photography texts to account for this discrepancy nevertheless tend to gloss over or merely restate the problem in terms of the observed phenomena, or claim that using 50 mm lenses &quot;approximates the angle of view and magnification of human vision&quot;, or that &quot;the normal focal length for a given format most closely approximates human sight, and projects an image with the least distortion and compression of space from foreground to background&quot;, or that &quot;the perspective is correct and we are most comfortable with a picture captured with a 50-mm lens&quot;.

== What is &#x27;normal&#x27;? ==
A test of what is a normal lens then, is to find one that renders a printed (or otherwise displayed) photograph of a scene that when held at &#x27;normal&#x27; viewing distance (usually arm&#x27;s length) in front of the original scene and viewed with one eye, matches the real-world and the rendered perspective, though Maurice Pirenne (in 1970) and others demonstrate that it is possible to see a scene made with any lens in normal perspective if one adjusts the viewing distance; but that range becomes impractically close for wide angle photographs or too lengthy for a telephoto, and it requires viewing it from a static point at the centre of perspective from which the image was made, supporting the observations of perspective paintings made by Leonardo da Vinci.

== The image circle ==
A normal lens typically has an angle of view that is close to one radian (~57.296˚) of the optical system&#x27;s image circle. For 135 format (24 x 36 mm), with an escribed image circle diameter equal to the diagonal of the frame (43.266 mm), the focal length that has an angle of one radian of the inscribed circle is 39.6 mm; the focal length that has an angle of one radian of the horizontally-bound inscribed image circle, is 33 mm; the focal length that has an angle of one radian of the vertically-bound inscribed circle, is 22 mm. This correlates with the popularity of 35 and 24 mm lenses, and the existence of 40 mm lenses, albeit the latter in a more restrained offer. A 50 mm lens has a vertical-bound inscribed circle angle of view of ~0.5 radians. A 70 mm focal length has a horizontally-bound inscribed circle angle of view of ~0.5 radians. An 85 mm lens has an enscribed (frame diagonal) circle angle of view of ~0.5 radians. Effectively, the 24, 35 and 40 mm trio have a 1:2 relation to the 50, 70 and 85 trio of focal lengths. &quot;Normal&quot; lenses, those that cover one radian in at least one of their inscribed or escribed image circles, belong to the first group, with 35 and 40 mm lenses closer to one radian than 50 mm lenses.

== Perspective effects of short or long focal-length lenses ==
Lenses with longer or shorter focal lengths produce an expanded or contracted field of view that appears to distort the perspective when viewed from a normal viewing distance. Lenses of shorter focal length are called &quot;wide-angle lenses&quot;, while longer-focal-length lenses are referred to as long-focus lenses (with the most common of that type being the &quot;telephoto lenses&quot;). Superimposing a wide-angle image print against the original scene would require holding it closer to the eye, while the telephoto image would need to be placed well into the depth of the photographed scene, or a tiny print to be held at arm&#x27;s length, to match their perspectives.

Such is the extent of distortions of perspective with these lenses that they may not be permitted as legal evidence.

The ICP &quot;Encyclopaedia of Photography&quot; notes that for legal purposes: &quot;Judges will not admit a picture that seems to have been tampered with or that distorts any aspect of the scene [or does not render a normal perspective]...That is, the size relationships of objects in the photograph should be equivalent to what they actually are.&quot;

== &#x27;Normal&#x27; lenses vary for different formats ==
For still photography, a lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format is considered to be a normal lens; its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large-enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance equal to the print diagonal; this angle of view is about 53° diagonally. For cinematography, where the image is larger relative to viewing distance, a wider lens with a focal length of roughly a quarter of the film or sensor diagonal is considered &#x27;normal&#x27;. The term normal lens can also be used as a synonym for rectilinear lens. This is a completely different use of the term.

==Typical normal focal lengths for different formats==

===Film still===

Typical normal lenses for various film formats for photography are:

For a 35 mm camera with a diagonal of 43 mm, the most commonly used &quot;normal&quot; lens is 50 mm, but focal lengths between about 40 and 58 mm are also considered &quot;normal&quot;. The 50 mm focal length was chosen by Oskar Barnack, the creator of the Leica camera. 

Note that the angle of view also depends on the aspect ratio. For example, a &quot;normal&quot; lens on 35 mm does not have the same view as a &quot;normal&quot; lens on 645.

===Digital still===

In digital photography, many smaller sensor sizes are specified in terms such as 1&quot; or 2/3&quot;.
These measurements do not correspond directly to dimensions of the sensor, but rather to dimensions of an equivalent video camera tube (VCT).
The normal lens focal length is roughly 2/3 of the video camera tube diameter.

===Cinema===
In cinematography, a focal length roughly equivalent to twice the diagonal of the image projected within the camera is considered normal, since movies are typically viewed from a distance of about twice the screen diagonal.

<doc id="176352" wikidata="Q501720" url="?curid=176352" title="Pomacentridae">
<text>Pomacentridae is a family of ray-finned fish, comprising the damselfishes and clownfishes. This family were formerly placed in the order Perciformes but are now regarded as being &quot;incertae sedis&quot; in the subseries Ovalentaria in the clade Percomorpha.
They are primarily marine, while a few species inhabit freshwater and brackish environments (e.g., &quot;Neopomacentrus aquadulcis&quot;, &quot;N. taeniurus&quot;, &quot;Pomacentrus taeniometopon&quot;, &quot;Stegastes otophorus&quot;). They are noted for their hardy constitutions and territoriality. Many are brightly colored, so they are popular in aquaria.

Around 385 species are classified in this family, in about 31 genera. Of these, members of two genera, &quot;Amphiprion&quot; and &quot;Premnas&quot;, are commonly called clownfish or anemonefish, while members of other genera (e.g., &quot;Pomacentrus&quot;) are commonly called damselfish. The members of this family are classified in four subfamilies: Amphiprioninae, Chrominae, Lepidozyginae, and Pomacentrinae.

The earliest known fossil damselfish is &quot;Chaychanus&quot; from the Early Paleocene of Chiapas, Mexico.

==Etymology==
The name of the family is derived from the Greek words; &quot;poma&quot; roughly translates to the English &quot;cover&quot;, referring to the fishes&#x27; opercula, and &quot;kentron&quot; is Greek for sting. The name refers to the serrations found along the margins of the opercular bones in many members of this family.

==Distribution and habitat==
Pomacentrids are found primarily in tropical seas, with a few species occurring in subtropical waters (e.g., &quot;Hypsypops rubicundus&quot;). Most species are found on or near coral reefs in the Indo-West Pacific (from East Africa to Polynesia). The area from the Philippines to Australia hosts the greatest concentration of species. The remaining species are found in the Atlantic or eastern Pacific. Some species are native to freshwater or brackish estuarine environments.

Most members of the family live in shallow water, from in depth, although some species (e.g., &quot;Chromis abyssus&quot;) are found below . Most species are specialists, living in specific parts of the reef, such as sandy lagoons, steep reef slopes, or areas exposed to strong wave action. In general, the coral is used as shelter, and many species can only survive in its presence.

The bottom-dwelling species are territorial, occupying and defending a portion of the reef, often centered on shelter. By keeping away other species of fish, some pomacentrids encourage the growth of thick mats of algae within their territories, leading to the common name farmerfish.

==Characteristics==

Pomacentrids have an orbiculate to elongated body shape, which is often laterally compressed. They have interrupted or incomplete lateral lines and they usually have a single nostril on each side (some species of &quot;Chromis&quot; and &quot;Dascyllus&quot; have two on each side). They have small- to medium-sized ctenoid scales. They have one or two rows of teeth, which may be conical or spatulate.

They display a wide range of colors, predominantly bright shades of yellow, red, orange, and blue, although some are a relatively drab brown, black, or grey. The young are often a different, brighter color than adults.

Pomacentrids are omnivorous or herbivorous, feeding on algae, plankton, and small bottom-dwelling crustaceans, depending on their precise habitats. Only a small number of genera, such as &quot;Cheiloprion&quot;, eat the coral where they live.

They also engage in symbiotic relationship with cleaner gobies of genus &quot;Elacatinus&quot;, allowing the gobies to feed on ectoparasites on their bodies. Clownfish also have mutualistic relationships with anemones. The anemone protects the clownfish while the clownfish rids parasites.

==Lifecycle==
Before breeding, the males clear an area of algae and invertebrates to create a nest. They engage in ritualised courtship displays, which may consist of rapid bursts of motion, chasing or nipping females, stationary hovering, or wide extension of their fins. After being attracted to the site, the female lays a string of sticky eggs that attach to the substrate. The male swims behind the female as she lays the eggs, and fertilises them externally. Varying by species, brood sizes range from 50 to 1000 eggs.

The male guards the nest for the two to seven days needed for the eggs to hatch. The transparent larvae are long. They go through a pelagic stage, which depending on the species, can last as little as a week or more than a month. When they arrive at a suitable environment, the young settle and adopt their juvenile colors.

In captivity, pomacentrids live up to 18 years, but they probably do not live longer than 10 to 12 years in the wild.

<text>Mineral wool is any fibrous material formed by spinning or drawing molten mineral or rock materials such as slag and ceramics.

Applications of mineral wool include thermal insulation (as both structural insulation and pipe insulation), filtration, soundproofing, and hydroponic growth medium.

== Naming ==
Mineral wool is also known as &quot;mineral cotton&quot;, &quot;mineral fiber&quot;, &quot;man-made mineral fiber&quot; (MMMF), and &quot;man-made vitreous fiber&quot; (MMVF).

Specific mineral wool products are &quot;stone wool&quot; and &quot;slag wool&quot;. Europe also includes glass wool which, together with ceramic fiber, are entirely artificial fibers that can be made into different shapes and are spiky to touch.

== History ==
Slag wool was first made in 1840 in Wales by Edward Parry, &quot;but no effort appears to have been made to confine the wool after production; consequently it floated about the works with the slightest breeze, and became so injurious to the men that the process had to be abandoned&quot;. A method of making mineral wool was patented in the United States in 1870 by John Player and first produced commercially in 1871 at Georgsmarienhütte in Osnabrück Germany. The process involved blowing a strong stream of air across a falling flow of liquid iron slag which was similar to the natural occurrence of fine strands of volcanic slag from Kilauea called Pele&#x27;s hair created by strong winds blowing apart the slag during an eruption. 

According to a mineral wool manufacturer, the first mineral wool intended for high-temperature applications was invented in the United States in 1942 but was not commercially viable until approximately 1953. More forms of mineral wool became available in the 1970s and 1980s.

== High-temperature mineral wool ==

High-temperature mineral wool is a type of mineral wool created for use as high-temperature insulation and generally defined as being resistant to temperatures above 1,000 °C. This type of insulation is usually used in industrial furnaces and foundries. Because high-temperature mineral wool is costly to produce and has limited availability, it is almost exclusively used in high-temperature industrial applications and processes.

=== Definitions ===

Classification temperature is the temperature at which a certain amount of linear contraction (usually two to four percent) is not exceeded after a 24-hour heat treatment in an electrically heated laboratory oven in a neutral atmosphere. Depending on the type of product, the value may not exceed two percent for boards and shaped products and four percent for mats and papers.

The classification temperature is specified in 50 °C steps starting at 850 °C and up to 1600 °C. The classification temperature does not mean that the product can be used continuously at this temperature. In the field, the continuous application temperature of amorphous high-temperature mineral wool (AES and ASW) is typically 100 °C to 150 °C below the classification temperature. Products made of polycrystalline wool can generally be used up to the classification temperature.

=== Types ===

There are several types of high-temperature mineral wool made from different types of minerals. The mineral chosen results in different material properties and classification temperatures. 

==== Alkaline earth silicate wool (AES wool) ====

AES wool consists of amorphous glass fibers that are produced by melting a combination of calcium oxide (CaO−), magnesium oxide (MgO−), and silicon dioxide (SiO2). Products made from AES wool are generally used in equipment that continuously operates and in domestic appliances. Some formulations of AES wool are bio-soluble, meaning they dissolve in bodily fluids within a few weeks and are quickly cleared from the lungs.

==== Alumino silicate wool (ASW) ====

Alumino silicate wool, also known as refractory ceramic fiber (RCF), consists of amorphous fibers produced by melting a combination of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and silicon dioxide (SiO2), usually in a weight ratio 50:50 (see also VDI 3469 Parts 1 and 5, as well as TRGS 521). Products made of alumino silicate wool are generally used at application temperatures of greater than 900 °C for equipment that operates intermittently and in critical application conditions (see Technical Rules TRGS 619).

==== Polycrystalline wool (PCW) ====

Polycrystalline wool consists of fibers that contain aluminum oxide (Al2O3) at greater than 70 percent of the total materials and is produced by sol–gel method from aqueous spinning solutions. The water-soluble green fibers obtained as a precursor are crystallized by means of heat treatment. Polycrystalline wool is generally used at application temperatures greater than 1300 °C and in critical chemical and physical application conditions.

==== Kaowool ====

Kaowool is a type of high-temperature mineral wool made from the mineral kaolin. It was one of the first types of high-temperature mineral wool invented and has been used into the 21st century. It can withstand temperatures close to .

== Manufacture ==
Stone wool is a furnace product of molten rock at a temperature of about 1600 °C through which a stream of air or steam is blown. More advanced production techniques are based on spinning molten rock in high-speed spinning heads somewhat like the process used to produce cotton candy. The final product is a mass of fine, intertwined fibers with a typical diameter of 2 to 6 micrometers. Mineral wool may contain a binder, often a terpolymer, and an oil to reduce dusting.

== Use ==

Though the individual fibers conduct heat very well, when pressed into rolls and sheets, their ability to partition air makes them excellent insulators and sound absorbers. Though not immune to the effects of a sufficiently hot fire, the fire resistance of fiberglass, stone wool, and ceramic fibers makes them common building materials when passive fire protection is required, being used as spray fireproofing, in stud cavities in drywall assemblies and as packing materials in firestops.

Other uses are in resin bonded panels, as filler in compounds for gaskets, in brake pads, in plastics in the automotive industry, as a filtering medium, and as a growth medium in hydroponics.

Mineral fibers are produced in the same way, without binder. The fiber as such is used as a raw material for its reinforcing purposes in various applications, such as friction materials, gaskets, plastics, and coatings.

=== Hydroponics ===

Mineral wool products can be engineered to hold large quantities of water and air that aid root growth and nutrient uptake in hydroponics; their fibrous nature also provides a good mechanical structure to hold the plant stable. The naturally high pH of mineral wool makes them initially unsuitable to plant growth and requires &quot;conditioning&quot; to produce a wool with an appropriate, stable pH. Conditioning methods include pre-soaking mineral wool in a nutrient solution adjusted to pH 5.5 until it stops bubbling.

=== High-temperature mineral wool ===

High-temperature mineral wool is used primarily for insulation and lining of industrial furnaces and foundries to improve efficiency and safety. It is also used to prevent the spread of fire.

The use of high-temperature mineral wool enables a more lightweight construction of industrial furnaces and other technical equipment as compared to other methods such as fire bricks, due to its high heat resistance capabilities per weight, but has the disadvantage of being more expensive than other methods.

== Safety of material ==
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the carcinogenicity of man-made mineral fibers in October 2002. The IARC Monograph&#x27;s working group concluded only the more biopersistent materials remain classified by IARC as &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot; (Group 2B). These include refractory ceramic fibers, which are used industrially as insulation in high-temperature environments such as blast furnaces, and certain special-purpose glass wools not used as insulating materials. In contrast, the more commonly used vitreous fiber wools produced since 2000, including insulation glass wool, stone wool, and slag wool, are considered &quot;not classifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans&quot; (Group 3).

High bio soluble fibers are produced that do not cause damage to the human cell. These newer materials have been tested for carcinogenicity and most are found to be noncarcinogenic. IARC elected not to make an overall evaluation of the newly developed fibers designed to be less bio persistent such as the alkaline earth silicate or high-alumina, low-silica wools. This decision was made in part because no human data were available, although such fibers that have been tested appear to have low carcinogenic potential in experimental animals, and because the Working Group had difficulty in categorizing these fibers into meaningful groups based on chemical composition.

The European Regulation (CE) n° 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures updated by the Regulation (CE) n°790/2009 does not classify mineral wool fibers as a dangerous substance if they fulfil criteria defined in its Note Q.

The European Certification Board for mineral wool products, EUCEB, certify mineral wool products made of fibers fulfilling Note Q ensuring that they have a low bio persistence and so that they are quickly removed from the lung. The certification is based on independent experts&#x27; advice and regular control of the chemical composition.

Due to the mechanical effect of fibers, mineral wool products may cause temporary skin itching. To diminish this and to avoid unnecessary exposure to mineral wool dust, information on good practices is available on the packaging of mineral wool products with pictograms or sentences. Safe Use Instruction Sheets similar to Safety data sheet are also available from each producer.

People can be exposed to mineral wool fibers in the workplace by breathing them in, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for mineral wool fiber exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5 mg/m3 total exposure and 3 fibers per cm3 over an 8-hour workday.

Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) is a European Union regulation of 18 December 2006. REACH addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment. A Substance Information Exchange Forum (SIEF) has been set up for several types of mineral wool. AES, ASW and PCW have been registered before the first deadline of 1 December 2010 and can, therefore, be used on the European market.

*ASW/RCF is classified as carcinogen category 1B.
*AES is exempted from carcinogen classification based on short-term in vitro study result.
*PCW wools are not classified; self-classification led to the conclusion that PCW are not hazardous.

On 13 January 2010, some of the aluminosilicate refractory ceramic fibers and zirconia aluminosilicate refractory ceramic fibers have been included in the candidate list of Substances of Very High Concern. In response to concerns raised with the definition and the dossier two additional dossiers were posted on the ECHA website for consultation and resulted in two additional entries on the candidate list. This actual (having four entries for one substance/group of substances) situation is contrary to the REACH procedure intended. Aside from this situation, concerns raised during the two consultation periods remain valid.

Regardless of the concerns raised, the inclusion of a substance in the candidate list triggers immediately the following legal obligations of manufacturers, importers and suppliers of articles containing that substance in a concentration above 0.1% (w/w):

* Notification to ECHA -REACH Regulation Art. 7
* Provision of Safety Data Sheet- REACH Regulation Art. 31.1
*Duty to communicate safe use information or responding to customer requests -REACH Regulation Art. 33

=== Crystalline silica ===

Amorphous high-temperature mineral wool (AES and ASW) is produced from a molten glass stream which is aerosolized by a jet of high-pressure air or by letting the stream impinge onto spinning wheels. The droplets are drawn into fibers; the mass of both fibers and remaining droplets cool very rapidly so that no crystalline phases may form.

When amorphous high-temperature mineral wool is installed and used in high-temperature applications such as industrial furnaces, at least one face may be exposed to conditions causing the fibers to partially devitrify. Depending on the chemical composition of the glassy fiber and the time and temperature to which the materials are exposed, different stable crystalline phases may form.

In after-use high-temperature mineral wool crystalline silica crystals are embedded in a matrix composed of other crystals and glasses. Experimental results on the biological activity of after-use high-temperature mineral wool have not demonstrated any hazardous activity that could be related to any form of silica they may contain.

== Substitutes for mineral wool in construction ==
Due to the mineral wool non-degradability and potential health risks, substitute materials are being developed: hemp, flax, wool, wood, and cork insulations are the most prominent. Biodegradability and health profile are the main advantages of those materials. Their drawbacks when compared to mineral wool are their substantially lower mold resistance, higher combustibility, and slightly higher thermal conductivity (hemp insulation: 0.040 Wmk, mineral wool insulation: 0.030-0.045 Wmk).

<text>Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier (; 11 March 1811 – 23 September 1877) was a French astronomer and mathematician who specialized in celestial mechanics and is best known for predicting the existence and position of Neptune using only mathematics.

The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus&#x27;s orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton. Le Verrier sent the coordinates to Johann Gottfried Galle in Berlin, asking him to verify. Galle found Neptune the same night he received Le Verrier&#x27;s letter, within 1° of the predicted position.

The discovery of Neptune is widely regarded as a dramatic validation of celestial mechanics, and is one of the most remarkable moments of 19th-century science.

==Life==
===Early years===
Urbain Le Verrier was born at Saint-Lô, Manche, France, to a modest bourgeois family, his parents being Louis-Baptiste Le Verrier and Marie-Jeanne-Josephine-Pauline de Baudre. 

He studied at the École Polytechnique – briefly chemistry, under Gay-Lussac, writing papers on the combinations of phosphorus and hydrogen, and of phosphorus and oxygen. 

He then switched to astronomy, particularly celestial mechanics, and accepted a job at the Paris Observatory. He spent most of his professional life there, eventually becoming director of the institution, 1854–1870 and again 1873–1877.

In 1846 Le Verrier became a member of the French Academy of Sciences, and in 1855 was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

===Career===
====Early work====
Le Verrier&#x27;s first work in astronomy was presented to the &quot;Académie des Sciences&quot; in September 1839, entitled &quot;Sur les variations séculaires des orbites des planètes&quot; (&quot;On the Secular Variations of the Orbits of the Planets&quot;). This work addressed the then most-important question in astronomy: the stability of the Solar System, first investigated by Laplace. He was able to derive some important limits on the motions of the system, but due to the inaccurately-known masses of the planets, his results were tentative.

From 1844 to 1847, Le Verrier published a series of works on periodic comets, in particular those of Lexell, Faye and DeVico. He was able to show some interesting interactions with the planet Jupiter, proving that certain comets were actually the reappearance of previously-known comets flung into different orbits.

====Discovery of Neptune====

Le Verrier&#x27;s most famous achievement is his prediction of the existence of the then unknown planet Neptune, using only mathematics and astronomical observations of the known planet Uranus. Encouraged by physicist Arago, Director of the Paris Observatory, Le Verrier was intensely engaged for months in complex calculations to explain small but systematic discrepancies between Uranus&#x27;s observed orbit and the one predicted from the laws of gravity of Newton. At the same time, but unknown to Le Verrier, similar calculations were made by John Couch Adams in England. Le Verrier announced his final predicted position for Uranus&#x27;s unseen perturbing planet publicly to the French Academy on 31 August 1846, two days before Adams&#x27;s final solution was privately mailed to the Royal Greenwich Observatory. Le Verrier transmitted his own prediction by 18 September in a letter to Johann Galle of the Berlin Observatory. The letter arrived five days later, and the planet was found with the Berlin Fraunhofer refractor that same evening, 23 September 1846, by Galle and Heinrich d&#x27;Arrest within 1° of the predicted location near the boundary between Capricorn and Aquarius.

There was, and to an extent still is, controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery. There is no ambiguity to the discovery claims of Le Verrier, Galle, and d&#x27;Arrest. Adams&#x27;s work was begun earlier than Le Verrier&#x27;s but was finished later and was unrelated to the actual discovery. Not even the briefest account of Adams&#x27;s predicted orbital elements was published until more than a month after Berlin&#x27;s visual confirmation. Adams made full public acknowledgement of Le Verrier&#x27;s priority and credit (not forgetting to mention the role of Galle) when he gave his paper to the Royal Astronomical Society in November 1846:

==== Tables of the planets ====
Early in the 19th century, the methods of predicting the motions of the planets were somewhat scattered, having been developed over decades by many different researchers. In 1847, Le Verrier took on the task to &quot;... embrace in a single work the entire planetary system, put everything in harmony if possible, otherwise, declare with certainty that there are as yet unknown causes of perturbations...&quot;, 
a work which would occupy him for the rest of his life.

Le Verrier began by re-evaluating, to the 7th order, the technique of calculating the planetary perturbations known as the perturbing function. This derivation, which resulted in 469 mathematical terms, was complete by 1849. He next collected observations of the positions of the planets as far back as 1750. Examining these and correcting for inconsistencies with the most recent data occupied him until 1852.

Le Verrier published, in the &quot;Annales de l&#x27;Observatoire de Paris&quot;, tables of the motions of all of the known planets, releasing them as he completed them, starting in 1858. 
The tables formed the fundamental ephemeris of the &quot;Connaissance des Temps&quot;, the astronomical almanac of the &quot;Bureau des Longitudes&quot;, until about 1912. 
About that time, Le Verrier&#x27;s work on the outer planets was revised and expanded by Gaillot.

====Precession of Mercury====
Le Verrier began studying the motion of Mercury as early as 1843, with a report entitled &quot;Détermination nouvelle de l &#x27;orbite de Mercure et de ses perturbations&quot; (&quot;A New Determination of the Orbit of Mercury and its Perturbations&quot;).
In 1859, Le Verrier was the first to report that the slow precession of Mercury&#x27;s orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by Newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets. He suggested, among possible explanations, that another planet (or perhaps, instead, a series of smaller &#x27;corpuscules&#x27;) might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun than that of Mercury, to account for this perturbation. (Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun.) The success of the search for Neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to place some faith in this possible explanation, and the hypothetical planet was even named Vulcan. However, no such planet was ever found, and the anomalous precession was eventually explained by general relativity theory.

===Later life===
Le Verrier&#x27;s methods of management were disliked by the staff of the &quot;Observatoire&quot;, and the disputes became so great that he was driven out in 1870. He was succeeded by Delaunay, but was reinstated in 1873 after Delaunay accidentally drowned. Le Verrier held the position until his death in 1877.

Le Verrier married Lucille Clotilde Choquet in 1837 and had 3 children. He died in Paris, France and was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery. A large stone celestial globe sits over his grave. He will be remembered by the phrase attributed to Arago: &quot;the man who discovered a planet with the point of his pen.&quot;

In 1847, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

<text>John Couch Adams ( ; 5 June 1819 – 21 January 1892) was a British mathematician and astronomer. He was born in Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, and died in Cambridge.

His most famous achievement was predicting the existence and position of Neptune, using only mathematics. The calculations were made to explain discrepancies with Uranus&#x27;s orbit and the laws of Kepler and Newton. At the same time, but unknown to each other, the same calculations were made by Urbain Le Verrier. Le Verrier would send his coordinates to Berlin Observatory astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle, who confirmed the existence of the planet on 23 September 1846, finding it within 1° of Le Verrier&#x27;s predicted location. (There was, and to some extent still is, some controversy over the apportionment of credit for the discovery; see Discovery of Neptune.) Later, Adams explained the origin of meteor showers, which holds to the present day.

Adams was Lowndean Professor in the University of Cambridge from 1859 until his death. He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866. In 1884, he attended the International Meridian Conference as a delegate for Britain.

A crater on the Moon is jointly named after him, Walter Sydney Adams and Charles Hitchcock Adams. Neptune&#x27;s outermost known ring and the asteroid 1996 Adams are also named after him. The Adams Prize, presented by the University of Cambridge, commemorates his prediction of the position of Neptune. His personal library is held at Cambridge University Library.

==Early life==

Adams was born at Lidcot, a farm at Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, the eldest of seven children. His parents were Thomas Adams (1788–1859), a poor tenant farmer, and his wife, Tabitha Knill Grylls (1796–1866). The family were devout Wesleyans who enjoyed music and among John&#x27;s brothers, Thomas became a missionary, George a farmer, and William Grylls Adams, professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at King&#x27;s College London. Tabitha was a farmer&#x27;s daughter but had received a rudimentary education from John Couch, her uncle, whose small library she had inherited. John was intrigued by the astronomy books from an early age.

John attended the Laneast village school where he acquired some Greek and algebra. From there, he went, at the age of twelve, to Devonport, where his mother&#x27;s cousin, the Rev. John Couch Grylls, kept a private school. There he learned classics but was largely self-taught in mathematics, studying in the Library of Devonport Mechanics&#x27; Institute and reading &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; and Samuel Vince&#x27;s &quot;Fluxions&quot;. He observed Halley&#x27;s comet in 1835 from Landulph and the following year started to make his own astronomical calculations, predictions and observations, engaging in private tutoring to finance his activities.

In 1836, his mother inherited a small estate at Badharlick and his promise as a mathematician induced his parents to send him to the University of Cambridge. In October 1839 he entered as a sizar at St John&#x27;s College, graduating B.A. in 1843 as senior wrangler and first Smith&#x27;s prizewinner of his year.

==Discovery of Neptune==

In 1821, Alexis Bouvard had published astronomical tables of the orbit of Uranus, making predictions of future positions based on Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and gravitation. Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise some perturbing body. Adams learnt of the irregularities while still an undergraduate and became convinced of the &quot;perturbation&quot; theory. Adams believed, in the face of anything that had been attempted before, that he could use the observed data on Uranus, and utilising nothing more than Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation, deduce the mass, position and orbit of the perturbing body. On 3 July 1841, he noted his intention to work on the problem.
After his final examinations in 1843, Adams was elected fellow of his college and spent the summer vacation in Cornwall calculating the first of six iterations. While he worked on the problem back in Cambridge, he tutored undergraduates, sending money home to educate his brothers, and even taught his bed maker to read.

Apparently, Adams communicated his work to James Challis, director of the Cambridge Observatory, in mid-September 1845, but there is some controversy as to how. On 21 October 1845, Adams, returning from a Cornwall vacation, without appointment, twice called on Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy in Greenwich. Failing to find him at home, Adams reputedly left a manuscript of his solution, again without the detailed calculations. Airy responded with a letter to Adams asking for some clarification. It appears that Adams did not regard the question as &quot;trivial&quot;, as is often alleged, but he failed to complete a response. Various theories have been discussed as to Adams&#x27;s failure to reply, such as his general nervousness, procrastination and disorganisation.

Meanwhile, Urbain Le Verrier, on 10 November 1845, presented to the &quot;Académie des sciences&quot; in Paris a memoir on Uranus, showing that the preexisting theory failed to account for its motion. On reading Le Verrier&#x27;s memoir, Airy was struck by the coincidence and initiated a desperate race for English priority in discovery of the planet. The search was begun by a laborious method on 29 July. Only after the discovery of Neptune on 23 September 1846 had been announced in Paris did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on 8 and 12 August but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map it was not recognized as a planet.

A keen controversy arose in France and England as to the merits of the two astronomers. As the facts became known, there was wide recognition that the two astronomers had independently solved the problem of Uranus, and each was ascribed equal importance. However, there have been subsequent assertions that &quot;The Brits Stole Neptune&quot; and that Adams&#x27;s British contemporaries retrospectively ascribed him more credit than he was due. But it is also notable (and not included in some of the foregoing discussion references) that Adams himself publicly acknowledged Le Verrier&#x27;s priority and credit (not forgetting to mention the role of Galle) in the paper that he gave &#x27;On the Perturbations of Uranus&#x27; to the Royal Astronomical Society in November 1846:

Adams held no bitterness towards Challis or Airy and acknowledged his own failure to convince the astronomical world:

==Work style==
His lay fellowship at St John&#x27;s College came to an end in 1852, and the existing statutes did not permit his re-election. However, Pembroke College, which possessed greater freedom, elected him in the following year to a lay fellowship which he held for the rest of his life.
Despite the fame of his work on Neptune, Adams also did much important work on gravitational astronomy and terrestrial magnetism. He was particularly adept at fine numerical calculations, often making substantial revisions to the contributions of his predecessors. However, he was &quot;extraordinarily uncompetitive, reluctant to publish imperfect work to stimulate debate or claim priority, averse to correspondence about it, and forgetful in practical matters&quot;. It has been suggested that these are symptoms of Asperger syndrome which would also be consistent with the &quot;repetitive behaviours and restricted interests&quot; necessary to perform the Neptune calculations, in addition to his difficulties in personal interaction with Challis and Airy.

In 1852, he published new and accurate tables of the Moon&#x27;s parallax, which superseded Johann Karl Burckhardt&#x27;s, and supplied corrections to the theories of Marie-Charles Damoiseau, Giovanni Antonio Amedeo Plana, and Philippe Gustave Doulcet.

He had hoped that this work would leverage him into the vacant post as superintendent of HM Nautical Almanac Office but John Russell Hind was preferred, Adams lacking the necessary ability as an organiser and administrator.

==Lunar theory – Secular acceleration of the Moon==
Since ancient times, the Moon&#x27;s mean rate of motion relative to the stars had been treated as being constant, but in 1695, Edmond Halley had suggested that this mean rate was gradually increasing. Later, during the eighteenth century, Richard Dunthorne estimated the rate as +10&quot; (arcseconds/century2) in terms of the resulting difference in lunar longitude, an effect that became known as the &quot;secular acceleration of the Moon&quot;. Pierre-Simon Laplace had given an explanation in 1787 in terms of changes in the eccentricity of the Earth&#x27;s orbit. He considered only the radial gravitational force on the Moon from the Sun and Earth but obtained close agreement with the historical record of observations.

In 1820, at the insistence of the &quot;Académie des sciences&quot;, Damoiseau, Plana and Francesco Carlini revisited Laplace&#x27;s work, investigating quadratic and higher-order perturbing terms, and obtained similar results, again addressing only a radial, and neglecting tangential, gravitational force on the Moon. Hansen obtained similar results in 1842 and 1847.

In 1853, Adams published a paper showing that, while tangential terms vanish in the first-order theory of Laplace, they become substantial when quadratic terms are admitted. Small terms integrated in time come to have large effects and Adams concluded that Plana had overestimated the secular acceleration by approximately 1.66&quot; per century.

At first, Le Verrier rejected Adams&#x27;s results. In 1856, Plana admitted Adams&#x27;s conclusions, claiming to have revised his own analysis and arrived at the same results. However, he soon recanted, publishing a third result different both from Adams&#x27;s and Plana&#x27;s own earlier work. Delaunay in 1859 calculated the fourth-order term and duplicated Adams&#x27;s result leading Adams to publish his own calculations for the fifth, sixth and seventh-order terms. Adams now calculated that only 5.7&quot; of the observed 11&quot; was accounted for by gravitational effects. Later that year, Philippe Gustave Doulcet, Comte de Pontécoulant published a claim that the tangential force could have no effect though Peter Andreas Hansen, who seems to have cast himself in the role of arbitrator, declared that the burden of proof rested on Pontécoulant, while lamenting the need to discover a further effect to account for the balance. Much of the controversy centred around the convergence of the power series expansion used and, in 1860, Adams duplicated his results without using a power series. Sir John Lubbock also duplicated Adams&#x27;s results and Plana finally concurred. Adams&#x27;s view was ultimately accepted and further developed, winning him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866. The unexplained drift is now known to be due to tidal acceleration.

In 1858 Adams became professor of mathematics at the University of St Andrews, but lectured only for a session, before returning to Cambridge for the Lowndean professorship of astronomy and geometry. Two years later he succeeded Challis as director of the Cambridge Observatory, a post Adams held until his death.

==Leonids==

The great meteor shower of November 1866 turned his attention to the Leonids, whose probable path and period had already been discussed and predicted by Hubert Anson Newton in 1864. Newton had asserted that the longitude of the ascending node, that marked where the shower would occur, was increasing and the problem of explaining this variation attracted some of Europe&#x27;s leading astronomers.

Using a powerful and elaborate analysis, Adams ascertained that this cluster of meteors, which belongs to the Solar System, traverses an elongated ellipse in 33.25 years, and is subject to definite perturbations from the larger planets, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. These results were published in 1867.

Some experts consider this Adams&#x27;s most substantial achievement. His &quot;definitive orbit&quot; for the Leonids coincided with that of the comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle and thereby suggested the, later widely accepted, close relationship between comets and meteors.

==Later career==

Ten years later, George William Hill described a novel and elegant method for attacking the problem of lunar motion. Adams briefly announced his own unpublished work in the same field, which, following a parallel course had confirmed and supplemented Hill&#x27;s.

Over a period of forty years, he periodically addressed the determination of the constants in Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s theory of terrestrial magnetism. Again, the calculations involved great labour, and were not published during his lifetime. They were edited by his brother, William Grylls Adams, and appear in the second volume of the collected &quot;Scientific Papers&quot;. Numerical computation of this kind might almost be described as his pastime. He calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant, perhaps somewhat eccentrically, to 236 decimal places and evaluated the Bernoulli numbers up to the 62nd.

Adams had boundless admiration for Newton and his writings and many of his papers bear the cast of Newton&#x27;s thought. In 1872, Isaac Newton Wallop, 5th Earl of Portsmouth, donated his private collection of Newton&#x27;s papers to Cambridge University. Adams and G. G. Stokes took on the task of arranging the material, publishing a catalogue in 1888.

The post of Astronomer Royal was offered him in 1881, but he preferred to pursue his teaching and research in Cambridge. He was British delegate to the International Meridian Conference at Washington in 1884, when he also attended the meetings of the British Association at Montreal and of the American Association at Philadelphia.

==Family and death==
After a long illness, Adams died at Cambridge on 21 January 1892 and was buried near his home in St Giles Cemetery, now the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge. In 1863 he had married Miss Eliza Bruce (1827–1919), of Dublin, who survived him, and is buried with him. His wealth at death was £32,434 (£2.6 million at 2003 prices).

<doc id="176363" wikidata="Q4659779" url="?curid=176363" title="A Staircase in Surrey">
<text>A Staircase in Surrey is a sequence of five novels by 
Scottish novelist and academic J. I. M. Stewart (1906–1994), and published between 1974 and 1978 by Victor Gollancz in London. The word &quot;Surrey&quot; in the title of the quintet refers to student accommodation in an imaginary Oxford college. (A staircase, in the more traditionally designed colleges, is a group of students&#x27; rooms, with a ground-floor entrance leading off a quadrangle.)

==The series==
The books, in order of publication, are:
*&quot;The Gaudy&quot; (1974)
*&quot;Young Pattullo&quot; (1975)
*&quot;A Memorial Service&quot; (1976)
*&quot;The Madonna of the Astrolabe&quot; (1977)
*&quot;Full Term&quot; (1978)

==Plot==

The narrator and central character is playwright Duncan Pattullo, son of Lachlan Pattullo, a noted Scottish artist specializing in landscapes but occasionally painting portraits. He is educated in Edinburgh, at a school clearly intended to recall Fettes, and then at the unnamed College in Oxford (of which Surrey is one of the quadrangles) as the John Ruskin Scholar.

In the first novel of the sequence, &quot;The Gaudy&quot;, Pattullo returns to his Oxford College, after a long absence (and a successful career as a playwright, including extended residence abroad), and encounters a number of old friends, including Albert Talbert, his former tutor in English Literature; Lord Marchpayne, formerly Tony Mumford (an undergraduate contemporary who lived in the set of rooms opposite his); fellow Scot and schoolmate Ranald McKechnie, now Regius Professor of Greek at the college (McKechnie&#x27;s wife, Janet, is Duncan&#x27;s first love); Cyril Bedworth (now the college&#x27;s Senior Tutor but formerly an undergraduate friend who lived at the top of Pattullo&#x27;s staircase); and Robert Damien (College doctor, but also a contemporary of Pattullo&#x27;s who embarrassed him by replacing the sketch for a famous painting that he owned with a bawdy picture of Mumford&#x27;s at exactly the point when the great and the good had assembled to view it).

The second novel, &quot;Young Pattullo&quot;, tells the story of their former relationships and Pattullo&#x27;s undergraduate career. In &quot;A Memorial Service&quot; Pattullo is instrumental in resolving the crisis caused by the academic insufficiency and aggressively anti-institutional behaviour of Ivo Mumford, his friend Tony&#x27;s son, and begins a tentative involvement with his cousin Fiona Petrie, a don at one of the women&#x27;s Colleges, as well as rekindling a friendship with Janet McKechnie. The title refers obliquely to the character of Paul Lusby, who committed suicide in the first novel as a result of a foolish wager proposed by Ivo Mumford, and whose brother Peter is seeking admission to the College, partly in memory of his brother. In &quot;The Madonna of the Astrolabe&quot; Pattullo has to cope with his ex-wife and her sexual designs on current undergraduates, the undergraduates&#x27; production of &quot;Tamburlaine&quot;, and the problems of raising enough money for the urgently needed restoration of the crumbling Great Tower (modelled on Tom Tower). The discovery of a lost masterpiece by Piero della Francesca proves crucial to the college&#x27;s future fortunes, and Pattullo is able to help when it is stolen. &quot; Full Term&quot; takes up Pattullo&#x27;s emotional conflicts but focuses on the scandalous, and apparently treasonous, behaviour of the College&#x27;s Physics tutor, William Watershute, which are dramatically resolved at the end.

== &quot;Roman à clef&quot; ==

&quot;A Staircase in Surrey&quot; functions partly as a &quot;Roman à clef&quot;, with multiple allusions to thinly-veiled people and places. The College, which is not named in the novels, is very clearly based on one of Stewart&#x27;s own Colleges, Christ Church, where he was Student (i.e. Fellow and Tutor) from 1949 until 1973, and University Reader in English. Surrey is modelled on Peckwater Quadrangle, which houses the College library as the novels suggest, but does not have a statue of a former Head of House (in the middle of Surrey there is a statue of Provost Harbage). The character of the Provost (Head of the College) is based on that of Henry Chadwick, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford during Stewart&#x27;s own time there. His name is taken from that of Edward Pococke (1604–91), seventeenth century Regius Professor of Hebrew (1648–91), after whom the Pococke Tree (the inspiration for Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Jabberwocky) and the Pococke Garden in Christ Church are named. The fantasy writer and Oxford don J. R. R. Tolkien appears (or is remembered) as the elderly &quot;Professor J. B. Timbermill&quot; in all the novels. The character of Arnold Lempriere, an ancient and semi-retired history don at the College, is based on the eccentric Christ Church Censor R. H. Dundas. Tony Mumford&#x27;s title &quot;Marchpayne&quot; is obviously both a nod to the Marquess of Marchmain, a character in Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s Brideshead Revisited (another novel partly set in Christ Church, Oxford), but also a joke on &quot;marchpane&quot;, an old name for marzipan. Stewart makes an oblique reference to himself in &quot;Full Term&quot;: &#x27;the other [new fellow], bald and abraded, was understood to have escaped in middle age from some professorial assignment in the antipodes&#x27; (p. 37) – Stewart had been Jury Professor of English at the University of Adelaide before obtaining his post in Christ Church.

==Evaluation==

Stewart&#x27;s sequence of novels is much appreciated for his learned allusiveness and the sheer polish of his narrative style, for his command of irony, and for his remarkable gift for accompanying dialogue with an acute psychological commentary on the contextual motivation for what is said. The quintet is unashamedly nostalgic for an era of Oxford manners that was in the 1970s waning if not already gone, and this has put some readers off (whilst probably attracting others). He reproduces authentic views held by the community he evokes about society, sex, politics, race and education that are by no means widely held nowadays. Few readers will now acquiesce in many of the assumptions made or implied in these areas by the characters or even the narrator. Stewart narrates a world in which privilege and snobbery are normal; he critiques this, but he does not transcend it. In the story about Ivo Mumford&#x27;s parachuting out of a rape charge a modern reader will surely regret any meaningful reflection on the situation of the victim. The sense that &quot;boys will be boys&quot; abounds in these novels, and there is a simplistic acceptance (on a narrative level) of the normality of class distinction and the way this impacts upon educational opportunity and success. Nevertheless, there is much sensitivity shown towards students who encounter problems. The novels are valuable above all for their insight into the social and intellectual dynamics of academic communities. In this respect Stewart is much more insightful than C. P. Snow, some of whose &quot;Strangers and Brothers&quot; novels from a previous era focus on similar bodies of people, and he is no less successful in plot-construction than his Cambridge counterpart.

<doc id="176366" wikidata="Q5527620" url="?curid=176366" title="Gaudy">
<text>Gaudy or gaudie (from the Latin, &quot;gaudium&quot;, meaning &quot;enjoyment&quot; or &quot;merry-making&quot;) is a term used to reflect student life in a number of the ancient universities in the United Kingdom as well as other institutions such as Durham University and Reading University. It is generally believed to relate to the traditional student song, &quot;De Brevitate Vitae&quot; (On the Shortness of Life), which is commonly known as the &quot;Gaudeamus&quot; (Let&#x27;s make merry) by its first word.

==Universities in England==
===Durham University===

At St Chad&#x27;s College the College feast day begins with a proclamation of the feast and includes an early rise, college invasions, green breakfast, as well as a host of competitions that see students spread out into the City vying to win various awards. More serious highlights include a service in the Cathedral and musical performances in the Quad. Alumni have a parallel set of events on or around the same day in Durham and (usually) in London. Previous events that were termed &#x27;gaudies&#x27; are now more often called &#x27;feasts&#x27; (by the college) or &#x27;mega-formals&#x27; (by the JCR): these are all black-tie and gowned affairs that occur several times a term to mark major feasts and special events.

===University of Oxford===

At the University of Oxford a gaudy (&#x27;gaude&#x27; at New College, Oxford, pronounced the same) is a college feast. It is often a reunion for its alumni. The origin of the term may be connected to the traditional student anthem, &quot;Gaudeamus&quot;.

Gaudies generally involve a celebratory formal dinner, generally in black tie and academic gowns (scarlet festal robes for doctors), and may include events such as chapel services, lectures , or concerts beforehand. For reunions, the invitees are generally graduate alumni from a number of (usually two or three) consecutive matriculation years, e.g. 1999–2001. Typically, gaudies are held for each year-group on around a ten-year cycle.

===University of Reading===
Wantage Hall, one of the university&#x27;s halls of residence, holds an annual Freshers Gaudie, which is a legacy from when the University of Reading was an extension college of Christ Church, Oxford University.

==Universities in Scotland==
===University of Aberdeen===
At the University of Aberdeen, the &quot;Gaudie&quot; is the name of the student newspaper produced under the auspices of the Aberdeen University Students&#x27; Association. It is recognised as the oldest student newspaper in Scotland.

===Universities of Dundee and St Andrews===
At the University of Dundee, gaudie nights are traditional student celebrations involving the issue of junior students (male &quot;bejants&quot; and female &quot;bejantines&quot;) with senior &#x27;academic parents&#x27; (typically one male, one female – a &quot;senior man&quot; and a &quot;senior woman&quot;) in order to introduce them to higher education and to provide socialisation. These events are usually held a short time after the institution&#x27;s Freshers&#x27; Week. The Night itself involves the academic parents taking their younger charges out for an evening&#x27;s entertainment at the parent&#x27;s expense.

These evenings are followed by Raisin Monday which is used by the junior students to thank the academic parents (usually in a ritualised fashion) for gaudie night. The junior student provides a gift for the senior student, and in turn receives a &quot;receipt&quot; from the senior – this receipt can be an item of clothing such as a hat or costume, or something challenging to carry, such as a car tyre or a lavatory seat, and the receipt is worn or carried by the bejant or bejantine until midday. Raisin Monday typically happens at some point in the early winter of the first semester.

Similar traditions remain at Dundee University&#x27;s erstwhile parent institution, the University of St Andrews, but are however incorporated into a Raisin Weekend and the term gaudie night is not used for the first night. Many traditions surround this event including Raisin receipts in Latin, a foam fight, and Raisin strings given by the academic mother to be hung on the Bejant/Bejantine&#x27;s academic gown.

St Andrews has a separate ceremony known as the gaudie which involves a gowned torchlight procession and singing of the Gaudeamus in memory of a student, John Honey who risked his life in 1800 to save survivors of a shipping accident offshore.

== Schools ==

* At St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford and Radley College in Oxfordshire, gaudy is the name given to the end-of-year celebrations; occasionally taking the form of an evening event.

== Cultural references ==

The Lord Peter Wimsey mystery &quot;Gaudy Night&quot;, by Dorothy Sayers, is partly set at such a reunion at a fictional women&#x27;s college at Oxford. Sayers also uses &quot;Gaudy&quot; as the name of one of the bells in &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot;.

<text>is a municipality in Telemark county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Grenland. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Porsgrunn. Some other notable settlements in Porsgrunn include the town of Brevik and the villages of Langangen and Heistad.

The municipality is the 315th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Porsgrunn is the 29th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 37,056. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 4.7% over the previous 10-year period. The conurbation of the cities of Porsgrunn and Skien is called Porsgrunn/Skien by Statistics Norway and it is considered to be the seventh-largest urban area in Norway.

==General information==
The town of Porsgrunn was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The small urban town of Porsgrunn grew over time. On 1 July 1920, the growing town annexed some adjacent areas of some of the neighboring rural municipalities: an area of Gjerpen Municipality (population: 437), an area of Eidanger Municipality (population: 550), and an area of Solum Municipality (population: 1,614).

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, there was a major municipal merger where the following areas were merged to form a new Porsgrunn Municipality.
*the town of Porsgrunn (population: 10,863)
*the town of Brevik (population: 2,498)
*all of Eidanger Municipality (population: 13,018)
*the Bakke area (population: 75) of Hedrum Municipality in Vestfold county
*the Enigheten, Høyberg, and Skavåsen areas (population: 12) of Brunlanes Municipality in Vestfold county

On 1 January 1968, an area of Skien Municipality (population: 3,554) was transferred to Porsgrunn Municipality (these areas had originally been part of Solum and Gjerpen municipalities).

===Name===
The place is first mentioned in existing historical records in 1576 (&quot;Porsgrund&quot;) by the writer Peder Claussøn Friis in his work &quot;Concerning the Kingdom of Norway&quot; (see the article: Norwegian literature). He writes: &quot;Two and a half miles from the sea, the Skien River flows into the fjord, and that place is called Porsgrund.&quot; The name was probably given during medieval times to the then swampy area by the nuns of Gimsøy Abbey, who went here to collect the shrub &quot;pors&quot; (&quot;Bog Myrtle&quot;). The last element of the name which means &quot;ground&quot;. The name was historically spelled &quot;Porsgrund&quot;. On 1 January 1930, the spelling of the name of the municipality was changed to &quot;Porsgrunn&quot;, giving it a more &quot;Norwegianized&quot; spelling.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was originally granted on 16 January 1905 for the town of Porsgrunn. The arms were originally devised in 1905 when the city needed a new city hall. After the municipal merger on 1 January 1964, the old arms were re-adopted by the new, larger Porsgrunn Municipality. The blazon is &quot;Gules and azure, a bend between a bog myrtle branch and an anchor argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a red (above) and blue (below) field (background) and the charge is a diagonal bend (stripe) with an anchor below it and the branch of a bog myrtle plant above it. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The silver bend (stripe) symbolizes the small river running through the city. The bog myrtle plant is a canting symbol since the name Porsgrunn comes from the Norwegian word for the plant. The anchor on a blue background symbolizes the importance of the local harbor and sea. The arms were designed by Wilhelm Rudolph.

===Churches===

The Church of Norway has two parishes () within the municipality of Porsgrunn. It is part of the Skien prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark.

==History==
Porsgrunn has been an important harbor town in the Grenland area since the late 16th century. In 1653, the Customs House was moved further down the &quot;Skien river&quot; from Skien to Porsgrunn mainly because industrial waste such as sawdust and mud made the river too shallow to allow boats to go any further up the river. Moving the Custom House to Porsgrunn added to the flourishing harbor activity and Porsgrunn became a thriving market town with a ladested status.

In the 18th century, Porsgrunn was the home of some of Norway&#x27;s most influential families at the time, such as the Aalls, Cappelens, Løvenskiolds, and Deichmans. Also in this period, Porsgrunn was considered the cultural centre of Norway. The city was granted limited city status as a kjøpstad in 1807. The town was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838, and it was expanded to full city status in 1842.

Porsgrunn was once home to &quot;Skomvær&quot;, the country&#x27;s largest sailing ship. In 1985, the sculpture &quot;Amphitrite, the wave and the sea birds&quot; was unveiled in Porsgrunn. The sculpture, which is one of Jørleif Uthaug&#x27;s best known works, has a nautical theme in honor of Porsgrunn&#x27;s maritime history.

==Geography==

Porsgrunn Municipality borders the municipalities of Skien and Siljan to the north, Bamble in the west, and Larvik in the east. It is part of a cluster of municipalities in southern Telemark that constitute the Grenland area of Norway. The Frierfjorden, Gunnekleivfjorden, and the mouth of the river &quot;Telemarksvassdraget&quot; or Porsgrunn River (&quot;Porsgrunnselva&quot;) are located in the western part of the municipality. The peninsula of Herøya, southeast of the main city centre, was originally an industrial park and has grown into a suburb of Porsgrunn. The Eidangerfjorden runs through the central part of the municipality.

==Government==
Porsgrunn Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Telemark District Court and the Agder Court of Appeal.

<doc id="176371" wikidata="Q2623261" url="?curid=176371" title="Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov">
<text>Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov (; 21 July O.S. 8 July] 1870 – 28 March 1922) was a Russian criminologist, journalist, and progressive statesman during the last years of the Russian Empire. He was the father of Russian-American author Vladimir Nabokov.

== Early life ==
Nabokov was born in Tsarskoe Selo, into a wealthy and aristocratic family. His father Dmitry Nabokov (1827–1904) was a Justice Minister in the reign of Alexander II from 1878 to 1885, and his mother Maria von Korff (1842–1926) was a Baroness from a prominent Baltic German family in Courland.

He studied criminal law at the University of St. Petersburg and taught criminology at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence.

Nabokov married Elena Ivanovna Rukavishnikova in 1897 with whom he had five children. Their eldest son was the writer and lepidopterist Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, who portrayed his father in his memoirs (&quot;Speak, Memory&quot;, 1967) and included in his novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot; a scene of misdirected assassination evoking the death of his father. Other children were Sergey (1900–1945), Kirill (1911–1964), Elena (1906–2000) and Olga (1903–1978), who was a childhood friend of Russian-American novelist Ayn Rand. His son Sergei was gay and was sent to Neuengamme labour camp, where he died on the 9 January 1945 due to a combination of dysentery, starvation and exhaustion.

==Career==

From 1904 until 1917 he was the editor of the liberal newspaper &quot;Rech&quot; (&quot;The Speech&quot;).

A prominent member of the Constitutional Democratic Party (CD, the &quot;Kadets&quot;), Nabokov was elected to Russia&#x27;s parliament, the First Duma. He was regarded as the most outspoken defender of Jewish rights in the Russian Empire, continuing in a family tradition that had been led by his own father, Dmitry Nabokov, who as Justice Minister under Tsar Alexander II successfully opposed anti-semitic measures being passed in the government. He was also a passionate opponent of the death penalty. He was identified with the party&#x27;s &quot;center&quot; and in favor of working with left-wing parties during the First State Duma and again during Russia&#x27;s second revolutionary period.

In 1917, after the February Revolution, Nabokov helped draft the document for Grand Duke Michael&#x27;s refusal of the throne. Nabokov was made secretary to the Provisional Government; however, he was forced to leave St. Petersburg in December 1917 after the Provisional Government was overthrown by the Bolshevik revolution. In 1918 he served as minister of justice in the Crimean Regional Government, where he and his family had taken refuge. In 1919 the Nabokovs fled to England and later settled in Berlin.

From 1920 until his death, Nabokov was the editor of the Russian émigré newspaper &quot;Rul‘&quot; (&quot;The Rudder&quot;), which continued to advocate a pro-Western democratic government in Russia.

==Death==
Nabokov attended a CD political conference in Berlin on 28 March 1922. During the proceedings, Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork and Sergey Taboritsky approached the stage singing the Tsarist national anthem and then opened fire on liberal politician and publisher Pavel Milyukov. In response, Nabokov jumped off the stage and wrestled Shabelsky-Bork down to the floor. Taboritsky then shot Nabokov three times at point-blank range, killing him instantly. The assailants failed even to wound their intended target Milyukov.

The assassins were subsequently convicted of the murder and sentenced to a 14-year prison term, but served only a fraction. The German judicial system was far more lenient with right-wing criminals than with their leftist counterparts. Upon his release, Shabelsky-Bork befriended Alfred Rosenberg, the notorious Nazi ideologue.

Nabokov is buried at the Berlin-Tegel Russian Orthodox Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Nabokov was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia’s Peoples.

<text>Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille (; ; 22 April 1797 – 26 December 1869) was a French physicist and physiologist.

Poiseuille was born and died in Paris.

==Fluid flow==
From 1815 to 1816 he studied at the École Polytechnique in Paris. He was trained in physics and mathematics. In 1828 he earned his D.Sc. degree with a dissertation entitled &quot;Recherches sur la force du coeur aortique&quot; (The force of the aortic heart). He was interested in the flow of human blood in narrow tubes, and invented the U-tube mercury manometer (or hemodynamometer) to measure arterial blood pressures in horses and dogs.

In 1838 he experimentally derived, and in 1840 and 1846 formulated and published, Poiseuille&#x27;s law (now commonly known as the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, crediting Gotthilf Hagen as well), which applies to laminar flow, that is, non-turbulent flow of liquids through pipes of uniform section, such as blood flow in capillaries and veins. The poise, the unit of viscosity in the CGS system, was named after him.

<doc id="176386" wikidata="Q515845" url="?curid=176386" title="Arthur Ransome">
<text>Arthur Michell Ransome (18 January 1884 – 3 June 1967) was an English author and journalist. He is best known for writing and illustrating the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series of children&#x27;s books about the school-holiday adventures of children, mostly in the Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. The entire series remains in print, and &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; is the basis for a tourist industry around Windermere and Coniston Water, the two lakes Ransome adapted as his fictional North Country lake.

He also wrote about the literary life of London, and about Russia before, during, and after the revolutions of 1917. His connection with the leaders of the Revolution led to him providing information to the Secret Intelligence Service, while he was also suspected by MI5 of being a Soviet spy.

==Early life==
Ransome was the son of Cyril Ransome (1851–1897) and his wife Edith Ransome (née Baker Boulton) (1862–1944). Arthur was the eldest of four children: he had two sisters Cecily and Joyce, and a brother Geoffrey who was killed in the First World War in 1918. Joyce married into the Lupton family, well-connected industrialists and politicians; she named one of her sons Arthur Ralph Ransome Lupton (1924–2009).

Ransome was born in Leeds; the house at 6 Ash Grove, in the Hyde Park area, has a blue plaque beside the door commemorating his birthplace. Ransome&#x27;s father was professor of history at Yorkshire College (now the University of Leeds). The family regularly holidayed at Nibthwaite in the Lake District, and he was carried up to the top of Coniston Old Man as an infant. His father&#x27;s premature death in 1897 had a lasting effect on him. His mother did not want him to abandon his studies for writing, but was later supportive of his books. She urged him to publish &quot;The Picts and the Martyrs&quot; in 1943, although his second wife Evgenia hated it, and was often discouraging about his books while he was writing them.

Ransome was educated first in Windermere and then at Rugby School (where he lived in the same study room that had been used by Lewis Carroll) but did not entirely enjoy the experience, because of his poor eyesight, lack of athletic skill, and limited academic achievement. He studied chemistry at Yorkshire College, where his late father had worked.

==Writing career==
After a year at Yorkshire College, he abandoned his studies and went to London to become a writer. He took low-paying jobs as an office assistant in a publishing company and as editor of a failing magazine, &quot;Temple Bar Magazine&quot;, while establishing himself as a member of the literary scene.

Some of Ransome&#x27;s early works were &quot;The Nature Books for Children&quot;, a series of children&#x27;s books commissioned by Anthony Treherne. Only three of the six planned volumes were published before the publisher went bankrupt. They are available on the &quot;All Things Ransome&quot; website.

In his first important book, &quot;Bohemia in London&quot; (1907), Ransome introduced the history of the city&#x27;s Bohemian literary and artistic communities and some of its current representatives. A curiosity in 1903 about a visiting Japanese poet, Yone Noguchi, led to an ongoing friendship with Japanese painter (and Chelsea neighbour) Yoshio Markino, who in turn introduced him to the Bohemian circle of Pamela Colman Smith, an artist best known for illustrating the Rider–Waite tarot deck.

Ransome married Ivy Constance Walker in 1909 and they had one daughter, Tabitha. It was not a happy marriage; Ransome found his wife&#x27;s demands to spend less time on writing and more with her and their daughter a great strain; his biographer Hugh Brogan writes that &quot;it was impossible to be a good husband to Ivy&quot;. They divorced in 1924.

Ransome began writing books of biography and literary criticism on various authors; one on Edgar Allan Poe was published in 1910 and another on Oscar Wilde in 1912. However, the latter embroiled him in a libel suit with Lord Alfred Douglas. His wife attended the 1913 trial, sitting in the public gallery as Ransome would not let her sit beside him. Her apparent enjoyment of the public notoriety the case attracted added to the stress on their marriage. The publisher Daniel Macmillan dined with the couple every day during the trial so that Ivy could not quarrel with Arthur. Ransome won the suit, supported by Robbie Ross, the editor of &quot;De Profundis&quot;. Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit. Ransome did, however, remove the offending passages from the second edition of his book and refused all interviews, despite the obvious publicity value.

Adding to Ransome&#x27;s &quot;wretched&quot; 13 months waiting for the case to come to trial was the action of his publisher, Charles Granville. &quot;Oscar Wilde, a critical study&quot; had been prepared under the guidance of publisher Martin Secker, but Granville had promised better returns and a guaranteed and steady income. Secker agreed to release the rights, and Ransome handed &quot;Poe&quot; and &quot;Wilde&quot; over to Granville. The work on Wilde was well received and successful, running to eight editions, but Ransome saw little in return; in 1912 Granville was charged with embezzlement and fled the country, leaving Ransome to struggle even to register himself as a creditor of Granville&#x27;s ruined company. Furthermore, his neglect of his health (he suffered from piles and a stomach ulcer) had been exacerbated by the pressure of defending the legal action.
Ransome had also been working on a similar literary biography of Robert Louis Stevenson, but that was abandoned with the manuscript in the first draft and not rediscovered until 1999. It was subsequently edited and finally published almost a century later in 2011 as &quot;Arthur Ransome&#x27;s Long-lost Study of Robert Louis Stevenson&quot;.

As an enthusiast for detective fiction, between 1939 and 1940 Ransome contributed to &quot;The Observer&quot; as a reviewer of new detective novels, using the pen-name of &quot;William Blunt&quot;.

==Foreign correspondent==
In 1913 Ransome left his first wife and daughter and went to Russia to study its folklore. In 1915, Ransome published &quot;The Elixir of Life&quot; (published by Methuen, London), which was to be his only full-length novel apart from the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series. It is a gothic romance concerning a youth who chances upon an alchemist who has discovered the titular elixir of life, whose powers must be renewed by the spilling of human blood. He published &quot;Old Peter&#x27;s Russian Tales&quot;, a collection of 21 folktales from Russia, the following year.

After the start of the First World War, in 1914, he became a foreign correspondent and covered the war on the Eastern Front for a radical newspaper, &quot;The Daily News&quot;. He also covered the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and came to sympathise with the Bolshevik cause, becoming personally close to a number of its leaders, including Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and Karl Radek. He met the woman who would become his second wife, Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina, who then worked as Trotsky&#x27;s personal secretary.

Ransome provided some information to British officials and the British Secret Intelligence Service, which gave him the code name S.76 in their files. Bruce Lockhart said in his memoirs: &quot;Ransome was a Don Quixote with a walrus moustache, a sentimentalist who could always be relied upon to champion the underdog, and a visionary whose imagination had been fired by the revolution. He was on excellent terms with the Bolsheviks and frequently brought us information of the greatest value.&quot; Nonetheless, in March 1919, on one of his return visits to the United Kingdom, the authorities interviewed him and threatened him with exposure as an agent. In October 1919, Ransome met Reginald Leeper of the Foreign Office&#x27;s Political Intelligence Department, who required Ransome privately to submit his articles and public speaking engagements for approval. Ransome&#x27;s response was &quot;indignant&quot;. Unbeknown to Leeper, Ransome&#x27;s &quot;near treason[ous]&quot; articles were written to buttress his exceptional access to the Bolshevik leadership. MI5, the British Security Service, was suspicious that Ransome and his fellow journalist, M. Philips Price, were a threat because of their opposition to the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War.

In October 1919, as Ransome was returning to Moscow on behalf of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, the Estonian foreign minister Ants Piip entrusted him to deliver a secret armistice proposal to the Bolsheviks. At that time, the Estonians were fighting their War of Independence alongside the White movement of counter-revolutionary forces. After crossing the battle lines on foot, Ransome passed the message, which, to preserve secrecy, had not been written down and depended for its authority only on the high personal regard in which he was held in both countries, to diplomat Maxim Litvinov in Moscow. To deliver the reply, which accepted Piip&#x27;s conditions for peace, Ransome had to return by the same risky means, but now, he had Evgenia with him. Estonia withdrew from the conflict, and Ransome and Evgenia set up home together in the capital Tallinn.

After the Allied intervention, Ransome remained in the Baltic states and built a cruising yacht, &quot;Racundra&quot;. He wrote a successful book about his experiences, &quot;Racundra&#x27;s First Cruise&quot;. He joined the staff of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; when he returned to Russia and the Baltic states. Following his divorce, he married Evgenia and brought her to live in England, where he continued writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, often on foreign affairs, and also writing the &quot;Country Diary&quot; column on fishing. On the Ransomes&#x27; return to England, &quot;Racundra&quot; was sold to the yachting author Kaines Adlard Coles, who sailed her back to England.

==&quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; series==

By the late 1920s, Ransome had settled in the Lake District because he had decided not to accept a position as a full-time foreign correspondent with &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. Instead he wrote &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; in 1929 – the first of the series that made his reputation as one of the best English writers of children&#x27;s books.

Ransome apparently based the Walker children (the &quot;Swallows&quot;) in the book partly on the Altounyan family. He had a long-standing friendship with the mother of the Altounyans, and their Collingwood grandparents. Later, he denied the connection, claiming he simply gave the Altounyans&#x27; names to his own characters; it appears to have upset him that people did not regard the characters as original creations. Letters also indicate that conflict arose between Ransome and the family.

Ransome&#x27;s writing is noted for his detailed descriptions of activities. Although he used many actual features from the Lake District landscape, he invented his own geography, mixing descriptions of different places to create his own juxtapositions. His move to near Pin Mill in East Anglia enabled him to enjoy sailing on the sea and brought a change of location for four of the books. Ransome started using the real landscape and geography of East Anglia, so that one can use the maps printed in the books as a guide to the real area. Ransome&#x27;s own interest in sailing and his need to provide an accurate description caused him to undertake a voyage across the North Sea to Flushing in the Netherlands. His book &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Mean To Go To Sea&quot; reflects that, and he based the fictional &quot;Goblin&quot; on his own boat &quot;Nancy Blackett&quot; (which in turn took its name from a character in the series).

Two or three of the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; books have less realistic plots. The original concept of &quot;Peter Duck&quot; was a story made up by the children themselves, and Peter Duck had appeared in the preceding volume, &quot;Swallowdale&quot;, as a character whom the children created, but Ransome dropped the foreword of explanation from &quot;Peter Duck&quot; before it was published. Although relatively straightforward, the story, together with its equally unrealistic ostensible sequel &quot;Missee Lee&quot;, is much more fantastic than the rest of the series. A trip to China as a foreign correspondent provided Ransome with the imaginative springboard for &quot;Missee Lee&quot;, in which readers find the Swallows and the Amazons sailing around the world in the schooner &quot;Wild Cat&quot; from &quot;Peter Duck&quot;. Together with Captain Flint (the Amazons&#x27; uncle Jim Turner), they become the captives of Chinese pirates.

&quot;Peter Duck&quot; was illustrated by Ransome himself using pen and ink, although the frontispiece claims that the book is &quot;Based on information supplied by the Swallows and Amazons and illustrated mainly by Themselves.&quot; Ransome then continued to illustrate the stories, and provided illustrations for new editions of the first two books of the series as of 1938, replacing images by Clifford Webb (whose illustrations for &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; had themselves replaced Steven Spurrier&#x27;s first edition drawings. Ransome had disliked Spurrier&#x27;s images and only the maps drawn by Spurrier were retained for the end paper and dust jacket).

The final book of the series, &quot;Great Northern?&quot; (1947) was set in Scotland, and while the plot and action appear realistic, the internal chronology does not fit the usual run of school holiday adventures. Myles North, an admirer of Ransome, provided much of the basic plot of the book.

&quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; was so popular that it inspired a number of other authors to write in a similar vein. Most notably, two schoolchildren, Pamela Whitlock and Katharine Hull, wrote &quot;The Far-Distant Oxus&quot;, an adventure story set on Exmoor. Whitlock sent the manuscript to Ransome in March 1937, and he persuaded his publisher, Jonathan Cape, to produce it, characterising it as &quot;the best children&#x27;s book of 1937&quot;.

==Sailing==

After the sale of &quot;Racundra&quot; in 1925 (in Coles&#x27; ownership she became &quot;Annette II&quot;), Ransome went on (in addition to the occasional charter, loan or trial sail) to own five further cruising yachts. His next yacht was the Hillyard-built &quot;Nancy Blackett&quot;, which he owned from 1935 to 1938. She was originally named &quot;Spindrift&quot; when launched in 1931.

After this came &quot;Selina King&quot;, a 35 ft 12 ton cutter with a canoe stern, designed by Frederick Shepherd and built at Harry Kings Yard in Pin Mill in 1938. She was laid up during the war and (on medical advice) they sold her in 1946.

After the war, he commissioned a ketch from Laurent Giles, again built in Pin Mill by Harry King: &quot;Peter Duck&quot;. He owned her from 1947 to 1949; her design was the basis for a class of which over 40 were built.

In July, 1951, he saw &quot;Norvad&quot;, a Hillyard five-and-a-half ton centre-cockpit yacht. With Evgenia, he had a trial sail in &quot;Norvad&quot; the following month in a hard offshore wind. They decided to get one, which he had decided should bear the name &quot;Lottie Blossom&quot;, and put in an order for that year&#x27;s Boat Show model. With a list of things they wanted done to modify the boat below decks from the standard production model, the boat was launched on 1 April 1952. Ransome&#x27;s health problems delayed their first sail to 15 April. 
In December 1952, he sold &quot;Lottie Blossom&quot; to Sir William Paul Mallinson on condition that he (Ransome) retained the name.

&quot;Lottie Blossom II&quot; followed early the next year, using the same design of hull, but with aft cockpit and tiller steering. They had two very happy seasons in her, sailing her comfortably on their own, including two voyages to Cherbourg. The second voyage, in 1954, at the age of 70, was to be Ransome&#x27;s last long passage.

==Personal life==
Ransome married twice, first to Ivy Constance Walker in 1909, with whom he had a daughter, Tabitha Ransome; the couple divorced in 1924. His second marriage, that same year, was to Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina. Although MI5 appeared satisfied with Ransome&#x27;s loyalty to Britain by 1937, KGB files that were opened following the end of the Soviet Union suggest that Evgenia Ransome, at least, was involved in smuggling diamonds from the USSR to Paris to help fund the Comintern. This is examined in the 2009 book &quot;The Last Englishman: the Double Life of Arthur Ransome&quot; by Roland Chambers. Ransome and his second wife are buried in the same grave.

==Death==
Ransome died in Cheadle Royal Hospital on 3 June 1967. He and his wife Evgenia are buried in the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s Church, Rusland, Cumbria, in the southern Lake District. The &quot;Autobiography of Arthur Ransome&quot;, edited by Rupert Hart-Davis, was published posthumously in 1976. It covers his life only to the completion of &quot;Peter Duck&quot; in 1931.

==Awards and accolades==
Ransome won the inaugural Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising &quot;Pigeon Post&quot; in the Swallows and Amazons series as the year&#x27;s best children&#x27;s book by a British subject.
He was appointed CBE in 1953. Durham University made him an honorary Master of Arts (which he told Cape to ignore) and Leeds University made him an honorary Doctor of Letters in 1952.

Translations of his books have been published in several languages and he became popular in many countries. Thriving Ransome appreciation societies exist in the Czech Republic, and in Japan where the Arthur Ransome Club was founded in 1987. Czech astronomer Antonín Mrkos named an asteroid after the author (6440 Ransome). The Arthur Ransome Society founded in 1990 in the U.K. now has a worldwide membership.
The Arthur Ransome Trust was launched in 2010 with the object of establishing a permanent Arthur Ransom Home for the study and appreciation Arthur Ransome&#x27;s life and works.

<text>The Internet Storm Center (ISC) is a program of the SANS Technology Institute, a branch of the SANS Institute which monitors the level of malicious activity on the Internet, particularly with regard to large-scale infrastructure events.

==History==
The ISC evolved from &quot;Incidents.org&quot;, a site initially founded by the SANS Institute to assist in the
public-private sector cooperation during the Y2K cutover. In 2000, Incidents.org started to cooperate with DShield to create a Consensus Incidents Database (CID). It collected security information from cooperating sites and agencies for mass analysis. 

On March 22, 2001, the SANS CID was responsible for the early detection of the &quot;Lion&quot; worm attacks on various facilities. The quick warning and counter-efforts organized by the CID were instrumental in controlling the damage done by this worm, which otherwise might have been considerably worse. 

Later, DShield was integrated closer into incidents.org as the SANS Institute started to sponsor DShield. The CID was renamed the &quot;Internet Storm Center&quot; in acknowledgement of the way it uses the distributed sensor network similar to the way a weather reporting center will detect and track an atmospheric storm and provide warnings. Since that time the ISC has expanded its monitoring operations; its website cites a figure of over twenty million &quot;intrusion detection log entries&quot; per day. It continues to provide analyses and alerts of security threats to the Internet community.

During the last hours of 2005 and the first weeks of 2006, the Internet Storm Center went to its longest period at the time to &quot;yellow&quot; on the Infocon for the WMF vulnerability.

The most prominent feature of the ISC is a daily &quot;Handler Diary&quot; which is prepared by one of the 40 volunteer incident handlers and summarized the events of the day. It frequently is the first public source for new attack trends and actively facilitates cooperation by soliciting more information to understand particular attacks better.

The Internet Storm Center is currently staffed with approximately 40 volunteers, representing 8 countries and many industries.

<doc id="176391" wikidata="Q586874" url="?curid=176391" title="Blue box">
<text>A blue box is an electronic device that produces tones used to generate the in-band signaling tones formerly used within the North American long-distance telephone network to send line status and called number information over voice circuits. During that period, charges associated with long-distance calling were commonplace and could be significant, depending on the time, duration and destination of the call. A blue box device allowed for circumventing these charges by enabling an illicit user, referred to as a &quot;phreaker&quot;, to place long-distance calls, without using the network&#x27;s user facilities, that would be billed to another number or dismissed entirely by the telecom company&#x27;s billing system as an incomplete call. A number of similar &quot;color boxes&quot; were also created to control other aspects of the phone network.

First developed in the 1960s and used by a small phreaker community, the introduction of low-cost microelectronics in the early 1970s greatly simplified these devices to the point where they could be constructed by anyone reasonably competent with a soldering iron or breadboard construction. Soon after, models of relatively low quality were being offered fully assembled, but these often required tinkering by the user to remain operational.

Over time, as the long-distance network became digitized, the audio call-control tones were replaced with out-of-band signaling methods in the form of common-channel signaling (CCS) carried digitally on a separate channel inaccessible to the telephone user. This development limited the usefulness of audio-tone-based blue boxes by the 1980s, and they are of little to no use today.

==History==

===Automated dialing===
Local calling had been increasingly automated through the first half of the 20th century, but long-distance calling still required operator intervention. Automation was deemed essential by AT&amp;T. By the 1940s they had developed a system that used audible tones played over the long-distance lines to control network connections. Tone pairs, referred to as multi-frequency (MF) signals, were assigned to the digits used for telephone numbers. A different, single tone, referred to as single frequency (SF), was used as a line status signal.

This new system allowed the telephone network to be increasingly automated by deploying the dialers and tone generators on an as-required basis, starting with the busier exchanges. Bell Labs was happy to advertise their success in creating this system, and repeatedly revealed details of its inner workings. In the February 1950 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, they published an advertisement, &quot;Playing a Tune for a Telephone Number&quot;, which showed the musical notes for the digits on a staff and described the telephone operator&#x27;s pushbuttons as a &quot;musical keyboard&quot;. Two keys on a piano would need to be pushed simultaneously to play the tones for each digit. The illustration did not include the tone pairs for the special control signals KP and ST, although in the picture the operator&#x27;s finger on the KP key and the ST key is visible. In the 1950s, AT&amp;T released a public relations film, &quot;Speeding Speech&quot;, which described the operation of the system. In the film, the tone sequence for sending a complete telephone number is heard through a loudspeaker as a technician presses the keys for dialing.

In November 1954, the Bell System Technical Journal published an article entitled &quot;In-Band Single-Frequency Signaling&quot;, which described the signaling scheme used for starting and ending telephone calls for the purpose of routing over trunk lines. In November 1960, an article in the Bell System Technical Journal provided an overview of the technical details of signaling systems, and disclosed the frequencies of the signals.

The system was relatively complex for 1950s technology. It had to accurately decode the frequencies and ignore any signals where that frequency might be accidentally created; music playing in the background might randomly contain the SF tones and the system had to filter these out. To do this, the signaling unit compared the signal power from a bandpass filter centered on 2600 Hz to signal power in other parts of the audio band, and only triggered if the tone was the most prominent signal. The originating end of the call would play the tone into the trunk line when the call ended, and trigger the remote end to end the call. After a short time, the originating end reduced the tone level and continued to send tone as long as it received on hook status from its local equipment.

===Discovery and early use===
Before the technical details were published, many users discovered unintentionally, and to their annoyance, that a 2600 Hz tone played into the caller&#x27;s handset would cause a long-distance call to disconnect. The 2600 Hz tone might be present if the caller were whistling into the telephone microphone while waiting for the called party to answer. Upon detecting the tone from the caller&#x27;s end, the receiving signaling unit sent an on hook status to the connected equipment, which disconnected the call from that point forward, as if the caller had hung up.

Among the earliest to discover this effect was Joe Engressia, known as &quot;Joybubbles&quot;, who accidentally discovered it at the age of seven by whistling. He became fascinated with the phone network, and over the next decade had built up a considerable base of knowledge about the system and how to place calls using the control tones. He and other phone phreaks, such as &quot;Bill from New York&quot; and &quot;The Glitch&quot;, trained themselves to whistle 2600 Hz to reset a trunk line. They also learned how to route telephone calls by flashing, that is using very short pulses of the on-hook signal, to send routing instructions.

At one point in the 1960s, packages of the Cap&#x27;n Crunch breakfast cereal included a free gift: a small whistle that, by coincidence, generated a 2600 Hz tone when one of the whistle&#x27;s two holes was covered. The phreaker John Draper adopted his nickname &quot;Captain Crunch&quot; from this whistle.

The &quot;toll free&quot; 800 service was launched in 1967 and gave the hackers easy numbers to call. The user would generally choose a number in the target area and then use it as above. Even if billing information were generated, it would be to a 1-800 number and thus free of charge. As before, the remote system would notice a call going to the ultimate non-free number, but could not match the other end.

===Technology===
It was technically possible to generate the tones with the technology available at the time the system was first deployed. A piano or electronic organ had keys that were close enough in frequency to work. With tuning, they could even be made dead on frequency. For dialing the phone number, the user would press two keys at a time. An experienced pianist might have found the key combinations awkward to play. But a blank player piano roll could have been punched to operate the required keys and dial a phone number. Another strategy would have been to purchase doorbells, remove the plungers, and mount them on a frame that could be set over the piano keyboard. Twelve DPDT pushbuttons, labelled KP, ST and the 10 digits, would operate pairs of plungers to play the phone company tones, after the E7 piano key had been pressed and released.

At the time, there were consumer devices for recording on wire or blank phonograph records, so the piano did not have to be near the phone. Consumer tape recorders came later and made the recording process easier. Small, battery powered, tape recorders allowed the tones to be played back almost anywhere.

It was possible to construct an electronic blue box with 1940s vacuum tube technology, but the device would have been relatively large and power hungry. Just as it did for radios, shrinking them from the size of toasters to the size of cigarette packages and allowing them to be powered by small batteries, transistor technology made a small, battery powered, electronic blue box practical.

AT&amp;T security captured its first blue box in about 1962, but it probably was not the first one built.

A typical blue box had 13 pushbuttons. One button would be for the 2600 Hz tone, pressed and released to disconnect the outgoing connection and then connect a digit receiver. There would be a KP button, to be pressed next, 10 buttons for telephone number digits, and the ST button to be pressed last. The blue box may have had 7 oscillators, 6 for the 2 out of 6 digit code and one for the 2600 Hz tone, or 2 oscillators with switchable frequencies.

The blue box was thought to be a sophisticated electronic device and sold on the black market for a typical $800–1,000 or as much as $3,500. Actually, designing and building one was within the capabilities of many electronics students and engineers with knowledge of the required tones, using published designs for electronic oscillators, amplifiers and switch matrixes, and assembled with readily available parts. Furthermore, it was possible to generate the required tones using consumer products or lab test equipment. The tones could be recorded on small, battery powered, cassette recorders for playback anywhere. In the early 1980s, Radio Shack sold pairs of Intersil 8038 voltage-controlled oscillator chips which were ideal for the purpose. A common hack was to use a TI-30 pocket calculator as the chassis of the device, with the diodes for the switch matrix wired into the keypad. A miniature audio jack connected through the recharge port for the calculator&#x27;s optional rechargeable battery would then be used to connect the speaker to play the tones into the handset.

To reduce call setup time, telephone numbers were transmitted from machine to machine in a &quot;speed dial&quot; format, about 1.5 seconds for a 10-digit number, including KP and ST. To catch the cheaters, AT&amp;T could have connected monitors to digit receivers that were not being used for operator dialed calls and logged calls dialed at manual speed. So, some hackers went to the extra trouble of building blue boxes that stored telephone numbers and played the tones with the same timing as the machines.

===Subculture===
The widespread ability to blue box, once limited to just a few isolated individuals exploring the telephone network, developed into a subculture. Famous phone phreaks such as &quot;Captain Crunch&quot;, Mark Bernay, and Al Bernay used blue boxes to explore the various &quot;hidden codes&quot; that could not be dialled by a standard telephone.

Some of the more famous pranksters were Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, founders of Apple Computer. On one occasion, Wozniak dialed Vatican City and identified himself as Henry Kissinger (imitating Kissinger&#x27;s German accent) and asked to speak to the Pope (who was sleeping at the time). Wozniak said in 1986:

Jobs later told his biographer that if it had not been for Wozniak&#x27;s blue boxes, &quot;there wouldn&#x27;t have been an Apple.&quot;

===In the media===
Blue boxing hit the mainstream media when an article by Ron Rosenbaum titled &quot;Secrets of the Little Blue Box&quot; was published in the October 1971 issue of &quot;Esquire magazine&quot;. Suddenly, many more people wanted to get into the phone phreaking culture spawned by the blue box, and it furthered the fame of Captain Crunch.
In June 1972, &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine printed the wiring schematics necessary to create a mute box (a variant of the blue box). All sold issues were recalled or seized from newsstands by police and officials of Pacific Bell, causing financial loss to the magazine. The magazine ceased operations for good in 1975.

The June 1975 issue of &quot;73&quot; magazine carried an article describing the rudiments of the long-distance signaling network, and how to construct and operate red and blue boxes. This article included a blue box schematic using the Intersil 8038 voltage controlled oscillator chip. Around the same time, do-it-yourself blue box kits became available.

In November 1988, the CCITT (now known as ITU-T) published recommendation Q.140 for the Signaling System No. 5, which caused a resurgence of blue boxing by a new generation of users.

In the early 1990s, blue boxing became popular with the international warez scene, especially in Europe. Software was made to enable blue boxing using a computer to generate and play the signaling tones. For the PC there were BlueBEEP, TLO, and others, and blue boxes were available for other platforms such as Amiga.

==Operation==

===Automating dialing===
Local plain old telephone service works by watching the voltage on the telephone lines between the telephone company&#x27;s exchange office and the customer&#x27;s telephone. When the phone is on-hook (&quot;hung up&quot;) the approximately 48 volt electricity from the exchange flows to the phone and is looped back without passing through the handset. When the user picks up the handset, the current has to flow through the speaker and microphone in it, causing the voltage to drop to under 10 V. This sudden drop in voltage signals the user has picked up the phone.

Originally, all calls were routed manually by an operator who would look for small light bulbs that would illuminate when a subscriber picked up the phone to make a call. The operator would connect a handset to the line, ask the user who they were calling, and then connect a cable between two phone jacks to complete the call. If the user was placing a long-distance call, the local operator would first talk to an operator at the remote exchange using one of the trunk lines between the two locations. When the local operator heard the remote customer come on the line, they would connect their local customer to the same trunk line to complete the call.

The calling process began to be automated from the earliest days of the telephone system. Increasingly sophisticated electromechanical systems would use the changes in voltage to start the connection process. The rotary dial was introduced around 1904 to operate these switches; the dial repeatedly rapidly connects and disconnects the line, a process known as pulse dialing. In common systems, these periodic changes in voltage caused a stepper motor to rotate one position for each pulse of a digit, with longer pauses to switch from one rotary switch to another. When enough digits had been decoded, typically seven in North America, connections between the rotors would select a single line, the customer being dialed.

The idea of using changing voltages to complete the call worked well for the local exchange where the distance between the customer and exchange office might be on the order of a few kilometers. Over longer distances, the capacitance of the lines filter out any rapid changes in voltage and dialing pulses do not reach the remote office in clean form, so that long-distance calls still required operator intervention. As telephone use grew, long-distance calling in particular, telephone companies were increasingly interested in automating this type of connection.

===Long-distance direct dialing===
To address this need, the Bell System adopted a second system on the circuits that connected the exchanges. When the user dialed a long-distance number, indicated in North America by dialing a &quot;1&quot; at the beginning of the number, the call was switched to a separate system known as a &quot;tandem&quot;. The tandem would then buffer the remaining digits and decode the number to see which remote exchange was being dialed, generally using the area code for this purpose. They would then look for a free trunk line between the two exchanges; if none were available the tandem would play the &quot;fast busy&quot; reorder signal to tell the user to try again later.

The basic protocol for finding a free line worked by playing a 2600 Hz tone into the line whenever it was not being used. The tandems at both ends of a given trunk line did this. When the tandem determined which remote exchange was being called it scanned the trunk lines between the two exchanges looking for the tone. When it heard the tone on one of the lines, it knew that line was free to use. They would then select that line and drop the 2600 Hz tone from their end. The remote tandem would hear the tone stop, drop their tone, and then play a &quot;supervision flash&quot;, making a &quot;ka-cheep&quot; sound, to indicate they had noticed the signal. The line was now free on both ends to connect a call.

Pulse dialing still had the problem that sending the dialed number to the remote exchange would not work due to the capacitance of the network. The tandems solved this by buffering the phone number and then converting each digit into a series of two tones, the multi-frequency signaling system, or &quot;MF&quot;. Once the local tandem had found a free line and connected to it, it then relayed the rest of the phone number over the line using the tone dialing method. The remote tandem then decoded the tones and turned them back into pulses on the local exchange. To indicate the start and end of a series of MF digits, special MF tones, KP and ST, were used.

When the call was finished and one of the parties hung up the phone, their exchange would notice the change in voltage and begin playing the 2600 Hz tone into the trunk line. The other end of the connection would respond to the tone by causing their local call to hang up as well, and then began playing the tone into their end as before, to mark the line as free at both ends.

===Blue boxing===
The blue box consisted of several of audio oscillators, a telephone keypad, an audio amplifier and a speaker. To operate a blue box, the user placed a long-distance telephone call, often to a number that was in the target area. Usually, this initial call would be to a 1-800 number or some other non-supervising telephone number such as directory assistance. Using a toll-free number ensured that the phone being used for access would not be billed.

When the call began to ring, the caller would hold the blue box speaker over the microphone in the handset and use the box to send the 2600 Hz tone (or 2600+2400 Hz on many international trunks followed by a 2400 Hz tone). The called office interpreted this tone as the caller hanging up before the call completed, disconnected the call, and began playing 2600 Hz to mark the line free. However, this did not disconnect the call at the caller&#x27;s end, but instead would leave the caller on a live line that was connected via a long-distance trunk line to a target exchange.

The caller would then stop playing the tone, which the exchange would interpret to mean the exchange&#x27;s tandem was attempting to place another call. It responded by dropping its tone and then playing the flash to indicate it was ready to accept routing tones. Once the called end sent the supervision flash, the caller used the blue box to send a &quot;Key Pulse&quot; or &quot;KP&quot;, the tone that starts a routing digit sequence, followed by either a telephone number or one of the numerous special codes that were used internally by the telephone company, then finished with a &quot;Start&quot; tone, &quot;ST&quot;. At this point, the called end of the connection would route the call the way it was told, while the caller&#x27;s local exchange would act as if the call was still ringing at the original number.

===Countermeasures===
Blue boxing remained rare until the early 1970s when the required systems began to drop in cost and the concept began to be more widely known. At the time, phreakers felt there was nothing Bell Telephone could do to stop blue boxing because it would require Bell to upgrade all their hardware.

For the immediate term, Bell responded with a number of blue box detection and law enforcement countermeasures. Armed with records of all long-distance calls made, kept by both mechanical switching systems and newer electronic switching systems, including calls to toll-free telephone numbers which did not appear on customer bills, telephone security employees began examining those records looking for suspicious patterns of activity. For instance, at the time, calls to long-distance information, while answered, deliberately did not return the electrical &quot;off hook&quot; signal indicating that they had been answered. When an information call was diverted to another number that answered, the billing equipment would log that event. Billing computers processed the logs and generated lists of calls to information that had been answered with an off-hook tone. In the early days, the lists were probably intended to detect equipment malfunctions, but the follow-up investigation did lead to blue box users. After the toll free &quot;800&quot; service was inaugurated, the billing computers were also programmed to generate lists of lengthy calls to toll free numbers. While many of these calls were legitimate, telephone security employees would examine the lists and follow up irregularities.

In this case, filters could be installed on those lines to block the blue box. Bell also would wiretap the affected lines. In one 1975 case, the Pacific Telephone Company targeted one defendant&#x27;s line with the following equipment:
* A CMC 2600, a device which registers on a counter the number of times a 2600 Hz tone is detected on the line;
* A tape recorder, activated automatically by the CMC 2600 to record two minutes of telephone audio after each burst of 2600 Hz activity; and
* A Hekemian 51A, which replicates the functions of the CMC 2600 and also produces a paper tape print-out of outgoing calls. Ordinary calls were recorded in black ink and destination numbers called via the blue box were recorded in red ink.

These actions resulted in several highly publicized trials.

===Decline===
The ultimate solution to the blue box vulnerability was to do what the phreakers thought impossible and upgrade the entire network. This process occurred in stages, some of which were already well underway in the early 1970s.

The T1 system was developed beginning in 1957 and began to be deployed around 1962. It digitized the voice signals so that they could be more efficiently carried in high-density connections between exchanges, carrying 24 lines on a single 4-wire connection. Depending on the network layout, the user might no longer be connected directly to a tandem, but instead to a local office that forwarded the signal over a T1 to a more distant exchange that did have the tandem. Simply due to the way the system worked, the supervisory signals had to be filtered out in order for the digitization of the analog signal to work. Recall that the 2600 Hz tone was not dropped from the trunk until the line was connected all the way and would be mixed with other tones like the ringing or busy signal; when used over a T1 this tone mixed with other signals and caused a problem known as &quot;quantization noise&quot; that distorted the sound. These tones were thus filtered down on either side of the T1 connection. Thus it was difficult to blue box in such an environment, although successes are known.

But blue boxing was eventually eliminated entirely for unrelated reasons. In the existing tandem-based network, completing a call required several stages communicating over the trunk line, even if the remote user never answered the call. As this process might take on the order of 10 to 15 seconds, the total wasted time across all of the trunk lines could be used to carry additional calls. To improve line usage, Bell began the development of the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS). This system performed all the calling and line supervision using a separate private line between the two offices. Using this system, when a long-distance call was placed the trunk line was not initially used. Instead, the local office sent a message containing the called number to the remote exchange using this separate channel. The remote office would then attempt to complete the call, and indicate this to the original office using the same private line. Only if the remote user answered would the systems attempt to find a free trunk line and connect, thereby reducing the use of the trunk lines to the absolute minimum.

This change also meant the signaling system was available internally to the network on this separate line. There was no connection between the user lines and this signaling line, so there was no route by which the users could influence the dialing. The same rapid reduction in prices that made the blue box possible also led to the rapid reduction in cost of the ESS systems. First applied only to their busiest connections, by the 1980s, the latest 4ESS models and similar machines from other companies were deployed to almost all major exchanges, leaving only corners of the network still connected using tandems. Blue boxing worked if one connected to such an exchange, but could only be used end-to-end if the entire network between the two endpoints consisted only of tandems, which became increasingly rare and disappeared by the late 1980s.

Analog long-distance transmission systems remained more cost effective for the long haul circuits until, at least, the 1970s. Even then, there was a huge installed base of analog circuits, and it made better economic sense to keep using them. It was not until competitor Sprint built its all digital, &quot;quiet&quot;, network, where &quot;you could actually hear a pin drop&quot;, that AT&amp;T took a multi-billion dollar write-off and upgraded its long-distance network to digital technology.

The phreaking community that had emerged during the blue box era evolved into other endeavors and there currently exists a commercially published hacking magazine, titled &quot;2600&quot;, a reference to the 2600 Hz tone that was once central to so much of telephone hacking.

==Frequencies and timings==
Each multifrequency tone consists of two frequencies chosen from a set of six, shown in the table on the left. The Touch Tone encoding is shown by the table on the right:

The rightmost column is not present on consumer telephones.
Normally, the tone durations for passing numbers from machine to machine in a &quot;speed dialing&quot; format are on for 60 ms, with 60 ms of silence between digits. The &#x27;KP&#x27; and &#x27;KP2&#x27; tones are sent for 100 ms. KP2 (ST2 in the R1 standard) was used for dialing internal Bell System telephone numbers. However, actual tone durations can vary slightly depending on location, switch type, and the machine status.

For operators, technicians, and blue box phone phreakers, the tone durations would be set by how long the buttons were held down and, for silence, how long before manually pressing the next button.

A blue box could have been constructed which would send the tones with machine to machine timing, with the number either stored in digital memory or a matrix of switches. In the switch matrix, there might be 10 rows for digits, each with 5 switches. Two switches would be moved to on, selecting the 2 tones. (KP and ST would be hard wired.) The 5 switches could be labelled 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7, with the user selecting pairs of switches adding to each digit, with special case 4 plus 7 for digit 0.

Alternatively, the tones could be recorded on magnetic tape, which would be cut into pieces and spliced together, using a commercial splicer for accurate alignment. If the phreaker matched machine dialing and recorded at 7.5 ips (inches per second), the splices for tone and silence would be about 1/2-inch long., with KP 3/4-inch long. For more manageable splicing lengths, the phreaker could use a 15 ips tape recorder, which was less common, and double those lengths. For those without a 15 ips machine but having 2 tape recorders, the tones could be recorded an octave low at 7.5 ips, the pieces spliced together would be were double those lengths. The spliced tape would be re-recorded from a 7.5 ips machine to a 3.75 ips machine. The resulting recording could be played back at 7.5 ips. An interval of 2600 Hz, to disconnect the trunk, followed by an interval of silence, to give enough time for a digit receiver to connect, would be added to precede KP.

This set of MF tones was originally devised for Bell System long-distance operators placing calls manually, as well as machine to machine dialing, and predates the DTMF &quot;Touch-Tone&quot; system used by subscribers. The leading 1 for customer dialed long-distance calls was not dialed. For operators, the line was muted during dialing, but, for customer telephones, it was only muted while a key was pressed. The Touch Tone frequencies were chosen to minimize the risk of customer talking while dialing, or background sounds, being registered as a digit or digits and resulting in a wrong number. Muting guarded against that happening during operator dialing, so the MF system did not have to be, and was not, so robust. The tones have a simple 200 Hz spacing. For Touch Tone, harmonic relationships and intermodulation products were taken into account in the choice of tones.

==Special codes==
Some of the special codes a person could get onto are in the chart below. &quot;NPA&quot; is a telephone company term for &#x27;area code&#x27;.

Many of these appear to have been originally three-digit codes, dialed without the leading area code, and the format of destination numbers dialed to the international senders has changed at various points as the ability to call additional nations was added.
* NPA+100 – Plant Test – Balance termination
* NPA+101 – Plant Test – Toll Testing Board
* NPA+102 – Plant Test – Milliwatt tone (1004 Hz)
* NPA+103 – Plant Test – Signaling test termination
* NPA+104 – Plant Test – 2-way transmission and noise test
* NPA+105 – Plant Test – Automatic Transmission Measuring System
* NPA+106 – Plant Test – CCSA loop transmission test
* NPA+107 – Plant Test – Par meter generator
* NPA+108 – Plant Test – CCSA loop echo support maintenance
* NPA+109 – Plant Test – Echo canceler test line
* NPA+121 – Inward Operator
* NPA+131 – Operator Directory assistance
* NPA+141 – Rate and Route Information
* 914+151 – Overseas incoming (White Plains, NY)
* 212+151 – Overseas incoming (New York, NY)
* NPA+161 – trouble reporting operator (defunct)
* NPA+181 – Coin Refund Operator
* 914+182 – International Sender (White Plains, NY)
* 212+183 – International Sender (New York, NY)
* 412+184 – International Sender (Pittsburgh, PA)
* 407+185 – International Sender (Orlando, FL)
* 415+186 – International Sender (Oakland, CA – in this era, 510 was TWX)
* 303+187 – International Sender (Denver, CO)
* 212+188 – International Sender (New York, NY)

Not all NPAs had all functions. As some NPAs contained multiple cities, an additional routing code was sometimes placed after the area code. For instance, 519+044+121 may reach the Windsor inward operator and 519+034+121 the London inward operator distant, but in the same area code.

==In other countries==
Another signaling system widely used on international circuits (except those terminating in North America) was CCITT Signaling System No. 4 (friendly named &#x27;SS4&#x27;).

Technical definitions are specified in formerly CCITT (now ITU-T) Recommendations Q.120 to Q.139.

This was also an in-band system but, instead of using multifrequency signals for digits, it used four 35 ms pulses of tone, separated by 35 ms of silence, to represent digits in four-bit binary code, with 2400 Hz as a &#x27;0&#x27; and 2040 Hz as a &#x27;1&#x27;. The supervisory signals used the same two frequencies, but each supervisory signal started with both tones together (for 150 ms) followed, without a gap, by a long (350 ms) or short (100 ms) period of a single tone of 2400 Hz or 2040 Hz. Phreaks in Europe built System 4 blue boxes that generated these signals. Because System 4 was used only on international circuits, the use of these blue boxes was more specialized.

Typically, a phreak would gain access to international dialing at low or zero cost by some other means, make a dialed call to a country that was available via direct dialing, and then use the System 4 blue box to clear down the international connection and make a call to a destination that was available only via operator service. Thus, the System 4 blue box was used primarily as a way of setting up calls to hard-to-reach operator-only destinations.

A typical System 4 blue box had a keypad (for sending four-bit digit signals) plus four buttons for the four supervisory signals (clear-forward, seize-terminal, seize-transit, and transfer-to-operator). After some experimentation, nimble-fingered phreaks found that all they needed was two buttons, one for each frequency. With practice, it was possible to manually generate all the signals with sufficient timing precision, including the digit signals. This made it possible to make the blue box quite small.

A refinement added to some System 4 blue boxes was an anti-acknowledgment-echo guard tone. Because the connection between the telephone and the telephone network is two-wire, but the signaling on the international circuit operates on a four-wire basis (totally separate send and receive paths), signal-acknowledgment tones (single pulses of one of the two frequencies from the far end of the circuit after receipt of each digit) tended to be reflected at the four-wire/two-wire conversion point. Although these reflected signals were relatively faint, they were sometimes loud enough for the digit-receiving circuits at the far end to treat them as the first bit of the next digit, messing up the phreak&#x27;s transmitted digits.

What the improved blue box did was to continuously transmit a tone of some other frequency (e.g., 600 Hz) as a guard tone whenever it was not sending a System 4 signal. This guard tone drowned out the echoed acknowledgment signals so that only the blue box-transmitted digits were heard by the digit-receiving circuits at the far end.

<text>The Sorrows of Young Werther (; ), or simply Werther, is a 1774 epistolary novel by Johann Wolfgang Goethe, which appeared as a revised edition in 1787. It was one of the main novels in the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; period in German literature, and influenced the later Romantic movement. Goethe, aged 24 at the time, finished &quot;Werther&quot; in five and a half weeks of intensive writing in January to March 1774. It instantly placed him among the foremost international literary celebrities and was among the best known of his works. The novel is made up of biographical and autobiographical facts in relation to two triangular relationships and one individual: Goethe, Christian Kestner, and Charlotte Buff (who married Kestner); Goethe, Peter Anton Brentano, Maximiliane von La Roche (who married Brentano), and Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, who died by suicide on the night of Oct 29 or 30, 1772. He shot himself in the head with a pistol borrowed from Kestner. The novel was adapted as the opera &quot;Werther&quot; by Jules Massenet in 1892.

==Plot summary==

Most of &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;, a story about a young man&#x27;s extreme response to unrequited love, is presented as a collection of letters written by Werther, a young artist of a sensitive and passionate temperament, to his friend Wilhelm. These give an intimate account of his stay in the fictional village of Wahlheim (based on , near Wetzlar), whose peasants have enchanted him with their simple ways. There he meets Charlotte, a beautiful young girl who takes care of her siblings after the death of their mother. Werther falls in love with Charlotte despite knowing beforehand that she is engaged to a man named Albert, eleven years her senior.

Despite the pain it causes him, Werther spends the next few months cultivating a close friendship with them both. His sorrow eventually becomes so unbearable that he is forced to leave Wahlheim for Weimar, where he makes the acquaintance of &quot;Fräulein&quot; von B. He suffers great embarrassment when he forgetfully visits a friend and unexpectedly has to face there the weekly gathering of the entire aristocratic set. He is not tolerated and asked to leave since he is not a nobleman. He then returns to Wahlheim, where he suffers still more than before, partly because Charlotte and Albert are now married. Every day becomes a torturing reminder that Charlotte will never be able to requite his love. She, out of pity for her friend and respect for her husband, decides that Werther must not visit her so frequently. He visits her one final time, and they are both overcome with emotion after he recites to her a passage of his own translation of &quot;Ossian&quot;.

Even before that incident, Werther had hinted at the idea that one member of the love triangle—Charlotte, Albert or Werther himself—had to die to resolve the situation. Unable to hurt anyone else or seriously consider murder, Werther sees no other choice but to take his own life. After composing a farewell letter to be found after his death, he writes to Albert asking for his two pistols, on the pretext that he is going &quot;on a journey&quot;. Charlotte receives the request with great emotion and sends the pistols. Werther then shoots himself in the head, but does not die until twelve hours later. He is buried between two linden trees that he had mentioned frequently in his letters. The funeral is not attended by any clergy, or by Albert or Charlotte. The book ends with an intimation that Charlotte may die of a broken heart: &quot;I shall say nothing of . . . Charlotte&#x27;s grief. . . . Charlotte&#x27;s life was despaired of.&quot;

==Effect on Goethe==

&quot;Werther&quot; was one of Goethe&#x27;s few works aligned with the aesthetic, social and philosophical ideals that pervaded the German proto-Romantic movement known as &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;, before he and Friedrich von Schiller moved into Weimar Classicism. The novel was published anonymously, and Goethe distanced himself from it in his later years, regretting the fame it had brought him and the consequent attention to his own youthful love of Charlotte Buff, then already engaged to Johann Christian Kestner. Although he wrote &quot;Werther&quot; at the age of 24, it was all for which some of his visitors in his old age knew him. Goethe had changed his views of literature radically by then, even denouncing the Romantic movement as &quot;everything that is sick.&quot;

Goethe described the powerful impact the book had on him, writing that even if Werther had been a brother of his whom he had killed, he could not have been more haunted by his vengeful ghost. Yet, Goethe substantially reworked the book for the 1787 edition and acknowledged the great personal and emotional influence that &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; could exert on forlorn young lovers who discovered it. He later commented to his secretary Johann Peter Eckermann on January 2, 1824 (as it was recorded by Eckermann and published in his book, &quot;Gespräche mit Goethe&quot;):

==Cultural impact==
&quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; turned Goethe, previously an unknown author, into a literary celebrity almost overnight. Napoleon Bonaparte considered it one of the great works of European literature, having written a Goethe-inspired soliloquy in his youth and carried &quot;Werther&quot; with him on his campaigning to Egypt. It also started the phenomenon known as &quot;Werther Fever,&quot; which caused young men throughout Europe to dress in the clothing style described for Werther in the novel. Items of merchandising such as prints, decorated Meissen porcelain and even a perfume were produced. Thomas Carlyle coined an epithet, &quot;Wertherism&quot;, to describe the self-indulgency of the age that the phenomenon represented. When Goethe completed Werther, he likened his mood to one experienced “after a general confession, joyous and free and entitled to a new life”. For Goethe the Werther effect was a cathartic one, freeing himself from the despair in his life. 

The book reputedly also led to some of the first known examples of copycat suicide. The men were often dressed in the same clothing &quot;as Goethe&#x27;s description of Werther and using similar pistols.&quot; Often the book was found at the scene of the suicide. Rüdiger Safranski, a modern biographer of Goethe, dismisses the Werther Effect &quot;as only a persistent rumor.&quot; Nonetheless, this aspect of &quot;Werther Fever&quot; was watched with concern by the authorities – both the novel and the Werther clothing style were banned in Leipzig in 1775; the novel was also banned in Denmark and Italy. It was also watched with fascination by fellow authors. One of these, Friedrich Nicolai, decided to create a satirical piece with a happy ending, entitled &quot;Die Freuden des jungen Werthers&quot; (&quot;The Joys of Young Werther&quot;), in which Albert, having realized what Werther is up to, loaded chicken&#x27;s blood into the pistol, thereby foiling Werther&#x27;s suicide, and happily concedes Charlotte to him. After some initial difficulties, Werther sheds his passionate youthful side and reintegrates himself into society as a respectable citizen.

The Hebrew translation was popular among youths in the Zionist communities in British Mandate of Palestine in the 1930s and 1940s and was blamed for the suicide of several young men considered to have emulated Werther.

Goethe, however, was not pleased with the &quot;Freuden&quot; and started a literary war with Nicolai that lasted all his life, writing a poem titled &quot;Nicolai auf Werthers Grabe&quot; (&quot;Nicolai on Werther&#x27;s grave&quot;), in which Nicolai (here a passing nameless pedestrian) defecates on Werther&#x27;s grave, so desecrating the memory of a Werther from which Goethe had distanced himself in the meantime, as he had from the &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot;. This argument was continued in his collection of short and critical poems the &quot;Xenien &quot; and his play &quot;Faust&quot;.

<doc id="176398" wikidata="Q289542" url="?curid=176398" title="Mount Monadnock">
<text>Mount Monadnock, or Grand Monadnock, is a mountain in the town of Jaffrey, New Hampshire. It is the most prominent mountain peak in southern New Hampshire and is the highest point in Cheshire County. It lies southwest of Concord and northwest of Boston. At , Mount Monadnock is nearly higher than any other mountain peak within and rises above the surrounding landscape. Monadnock&#x27;s bare, isolated, and rocky summit provides expansive views. It is known for being featured in the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.

Mt. Monadnock has long been cited as one of the most frequently climbed mountains in the world. It bears a number of hiking trails, including the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway. The summit is barren largely because of fires set by early settlers. The first major fire, set in 1800 to clear the lower slopes for pasture, swept through the stands of virgin red spruce on the summit and flanks of the mountain. Between 1810 and 1820, local farmers, who believed that wolves were denning in the blowdowns, set fire to the mountain again. The conflagration raged for weeks, destroying the topsoil and denuding the mountain above .

The term &quot;monadnock&quot; is used by American geologists to describe any isolated mountain formed from the exposure of a harder rock as a result of the erosion of a softer one once surrounding it (a landform termed &quot;&quot;inselberg&quot; (&quot;island-peak&quot;) elsewhere in the world).

==Name==
It is thought to derive from either the Abenaki () or (). The term was adopted by early settlers of southern New Hampshire and later by American geologists as an alternative term for an inselberg or isolated mountain. Mount Monadnock is often called &quot;Grand Monadnock&quot;, to differentiate it from other Vermont and New Hampshire peaks with &quot;Monadnock&quot; in their names.

Its official name on federal maps is &quot;Monadnock Mountain&quot;.

==History==
===The transcendentalists===
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller visited the mountain and wrote fondly of it. Emerson was a frequent visitor, and made the mountain the subject of &quot;Monadnoc&quot;, one of his most famous poems. Thoreau visited the mountain four times between 1844 and 1860, and spent a great deal of time observing and cataloging natural phenomena. He is regarded as having written one of the first serious naturalist inventories of the mountain. A bog near the summit of Mount Monadnock and a rocky lookout off the Cliff Walk trail are named after him; another lookout is named after Emerson.

===The Halfway House and other structures===
In 1858, Moses Cudworth of Rindge opened the &quot;Halfway House&quot; hotel on the south side of the mountain, roughly halfway from the base to the summit. The &quot;Toll Road&quot; was built to service it. By that time the popularity of the mountain was booming, and it was not long before Cudworth enlarged the hotel to accommodate 100 guests. On busy summer days, the stables at the Halfway House held as many as 75 horses. The Halfway House became public property when hundreds of residents of the nearby towns formed a coalition to buy the Toll Road and hotel, and worked to prevent a radio tower from being constructed on the summit. After the hotel burned down in 1954, a concession stand operated at the site until 1969. It and the toll road were both closed to public vehicles. Moses Spring, with its source in a hole drilled through a rock behind the site, is one of the few remaining artifacts of the hotel years. The foundations of two water tanks, and the nearby reservoir that fed them, are extant on the hillside above the Old Halfway House.

A small firewarden&#x27;s hut was located on the summit of Mount Monadnock and operated from 1911 to 1948, when it was decommissioned with the advent of modern means of detecting forest fires. The hut was used as a snack bar concession and hikers&#x27; shelter until 1969; it was removed in 1972. A small cabin, located farther down the mountain, served as the fire lookout&#x27;s residence. It, too, has been removed.

A private dwelling, south of the site of the former Halfway House, is the last remaining inholding on the mountain above .

===Hiking history===

The earliest recorded ascent of Mount Monadnock took place in 1725 by Captain Samuel Willard and fourteen rangers under his command who camped at the top and used the summit as a lookout while patrolling for Native Americans. Before the practice came to be frowned upon, many early hikers carved their names in the summit; the earliest such engraving reads &quot;S. Dakin, 1801&quot; and is attributed to a local town clerk.

Notable &quot;power hiking&quot; records associated with the mountain include that of Garry Harrington, who hiked to the summit 16 times in a 24-hour period, and Larry Davis, who claimed to have hiked to the summit daily for 2,850 consecutive days (7.8 years). Davis has hiked the mountain over 7,250 times in the past 35 years.

Monadnock is often claimed to be the second-most frequently climbed mountain in the world, after Mount Fuji in Japan. Monadnock is climbed by 125,000 hikers yearly, while Mount Fuji sees 200,000-300,000 hikers yearly. However, according to UNESCO, Tai Shan in China receives more than 2 million visitors a year, far surpassing the other two peaks in popularity.

==Bio-geography, ecology, and geology==


Due to fires in the early 19th century which burned a majority of the top around the summit, there is little soil cover on the peak and surrounding uplands. Soils are mapped as Rock Outcrop over a large area around the summit, while low-lying areas have classic podzol stony fine sandy loam profiles usually mapped as Lyman or Tunbridge series. Although the mountain has recovered to the degree that its landscape appears natural, Mount Monadnock is an example of a mountain which has an artificial tree line, occurring well below the climatic tree line of similar mountains in the region.

From the base to the summit, floral species diminish with increasingly shallow soil levels. The summit is home to many different specialized sub-alpine species which can retain moisture for long periods of time. Alpine and sub-alpine species include mountain ash, cotton grass, sheep laurel, mountain sandwort, and the mountain cranberry. Krummholz, trees stunted by harsh weather, are found on Mount Monadnock, as are several alpine bogs. Lower elevations on Mount Monadnock are clad in northern hardwood forest species; middle elevations support stands of red spruce. Before the fires, Mount Monadnock was totally covered in a red spruce forest. Since the summit has been barren of soil cover, red spruce have been slowly ascending back towards the top in a process known as ecological succession.

The mountain is largely composed of 400-million-year-old schist and quartzite rock primarily associated with the Devonian Littleton Formation, which extends south into Massachusetts and north into the White Mountains. At lower elevations on the mountain, and stratigraphically below the Littleton Formation, the bedrock is from the Silurian period, consisting of Rangeley Formation schists, Perry Mountain Formation quartzites, the Francestown Formation granulite, and the Warner Formation granulite. Structurally, the mountain is part of an overturned syncline – called a fold nappe – that was caused by the compressional forces of the Acadian orogeny. Dramatic small- to medium-scale metamorphic folds are visible on many of the rock faces of the mountain, including the famous Billings Fold (a recumbent syncline found about west of the summit), shown in the 1942 edition of Marland P. Billings&#x27; &quot;Structural Geology&quot;. In addition to impressive folds, the Devonian Littleton Formation shows large pseudomorphs of sillimanite after andalusite that occur as &quot;turkey tracks&quot;.

===Climate===
Mount Monadnock has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;) characteristics.

==Hydrology==
Mount Monadnock lies on the divide between the Connecticut River and Merrimack River watersheds. The northern slopes of the mountain drain to Howe Reservoir, then via Minnewawa Brook to the Ashuelot River, the Connecticut River, and ultimately Long Island Sound. Gleason Brook and Mountain Brook flow off the western slopes, then via Shaker Brook to the South Branch of the Ashuelot River. The southwestern slopes of the mountain drain to Fassett Brook, then Quarry Brook, before reaching the South Branch of the Ashuelot.

To the southeast of the mountain, Mead Brook and Stony Brook flow to Mountain Brook, a tributary of the Contoocook River, which flows north to the Merrimack River and ultimately the Gulf of Maine. The eastern slopes of the mountain drain to Thorndike Pond, the outlet of which (Stanley Brook) flows northeast to Nubanusit Brook, then into the Contoocook and the Merrimack.

==Recreation==
Mount Monadnock is open to hiking, backpacking, picnicking, and snowshoeing. Backcountry skiing is possible on some of the lower trails. A seasonal campground east of the mountain is maintained by the state of New Hampshire, but camping is not allowed anywhere else on the mountain. A per-vehicle fee is charged to park at the Old Toll Road and State Park Headquarters trailheads. There are no roads to the summit, and the Old Toll Road, which leads to the Halfway House site, is closed to vehicles. ATVs are not allowed on the mountain. Good views of the mountain can be had from a number of regional roads and highways, especially from New Hampshire Route 124.

===Trails===
Mount Monadnock is criss-crossed by many miles of well-maintained hiking trails. The most popular trails are the White Dot Trail, , the shortest but steepest ascent to summit, accessible from the Monadnock State Park headquarters and campground on the southeast side of the mountain; and the White Arrow Trail, to summit, considered the easiest ascent, via the Old Toll Road (Halfway House) trailhead on the south side of the mountain. Other major trails include:

* The Marlboro Trail, on the west side of the mountain, to summit
* The Dublin Path, also part of the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, on the north side, to summit
* The Pumpelly Trail, on the northeast side, the longest ascent, to summit. This trail boasts panoramic views for longer than the other trails, as it hugs the ridge.
* The Birchtoft Trail (Gilson Pond trailhead) and several connecting trails, providing access to the summit from the east side of the mountain
* The Cascade Link, on the east side of Monadnock, connects the White Dot Trail to Pumpelly Trail while providing easterly views from its exposed ridge. Spellman Trail and Red Dot Trail may also be accessed from Cascade Link.

Other important trails include the White Cross Trail, an alternative parallel to the White Dot Trail, and the Cliff Walk, a scenic detour that shadows a ledge to the east of the White Arrow Trail.

Mount Monadnock is the northern terminus of the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail (also known as the &quot;M&amp;M Trail&quot;), a hiking trail stretching south through Massachusetts to the Connecticut border. The trail ascends the mountain from the southwest; however, there is no trailhead where that trail crosses Route 124 at the foot of the mountain, and the highway there is marked with &quot;no parking&quot; signs. The closest trailhead southbound on the M&amp;M Trail is on Bullard Road, which leads south from Route 124 half a mile west of the M&amp;M Trail&#x27;s crossing of the state highway.

The mountain is also the southern terminus of the Monadnock-Sunapee Greenway, a highland trail connecting Mount Monadnock and Mount Sunapee. A third long-distance trail project, the &quot;Wantastiquet-Monadnock Greenway&quot;, aims at linking Mount Monadnock with Pisgah State Park and Wantastiquet Mountain, a prominent peak in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, overlooking the town of Brattleboro, Vermont, and the Connecticut River.

===Hiking the mountain===
The trip to the summit and back via one of the shorter trails, which usually takes less than six hours, is considered moderately challenging for the average hiker but requires no technical skills during the late spring to early fall season. Throughout the year wind and weather on the exposed, rocky summit cause harsher conditions than below the tree line. Winter storms and summer thunderstorms can be life-threatening.

Winter snow and ice can remain on the trails well into May, making hiking hazardous or impossible without special equipment. The compacting of snow due to winter recreation on the more frequently used trails tends to lengthen the time it takes for the snow and ice to melt off. Stabilizers, crampons, ice axes, ski poles, and snowshoes may be helpful or necessary for winter and early spring ascents, depending on ice and snow cover.

Fall hiking generally requires warmer clothing, an awareness of weather conditions, and earlier ascent times. As there are no reliable water sources on the mountain and little shelter from the sun above , dehydration and heat stroke are potential hazards.

The mountain and surrounding area are black bear habitat, although problem encounters with bears are rare.

Advice on hiking can be solicited from Memorial Day through Columbus Day and select off-season weekends at the park headquarters on the southeast side of the mountain. Trail descriptions and maps of Mount Monadnock are published by a variety of sources. The Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests prints a guidebook with maps, trail descriptions, history, geology, ecology, and other trivia on the mountain.

==Conservation==
Most of the mountain has been protected and is not subject to development. The Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests is the major landowner, holding over in its Monadnock Reservation. Lands on Monadnock are leased to the state for management purposes. An additional on the mountain are owned directly by the state of New Hampshire as Monadnock State Park. The town of Jaffrey also owns portions of the mountain.

In 2000, the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail was included in a study by the National Park Service for possible inclusion in a new National Scenic Trail. The resulting New England National Scenic Trail includes the Mattabesett and Metacomet trails in Connecticut and the Massachusetts portion of the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail, giving it some of the status accorded to the Appalachian Trail. However, the New Hampshire section of the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail was not included in the final NST designation.

==Tributes==
Beside Emerson and Thoreau, other artists and writers have been inspired by Mount Monadnock, including:

* William Preston Phelps (1848–1917) was known as &quot;the Painter of Mount Monadnock&quot;.
* Many other American artists have painted Mount Monadnock, among them Abbott Handerson Thayer, Rockwell Kent and Richard Whitney.
* The American composer Alan Hovhaness (1911–2000), who climbed Mount Monadnock several times during his youth, composed the symphonic fantasy entitled &quot;Monadnock&quot;, Op. 2, No. 1, circa 1935.
* H. P. Lovecraft, the early 20th century writer of horror, science fiction and fantasy, authored the poem &quot;To Templeton and Mount Monadnock&quot;.
* Galway Kinnell, a Pulitzer Prize–winning poet, wrote the poem &quot;Flower Herding on Mount Monadnock&quot;.
* Poet Edwin Arlington Robinson, who summered in Monadnock&#x27;s shadow from 1911 to 1934, wrote the poem &quot;Monadnock Through the Trees&quot;.
* Part of the yearly Mount Monadnock Celebration of Dance takes place on the summit of Mount Monadnock at the autumn equinox.

Several United States Navy ships were named USS &quot;Monadnock&quot; in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

In 1961, F. Nelson Blount established the Monadnock, Steamtown &amp; Northern Railroad, a local steam-powered tourist railroad named after the mountain and Steamtown USA, Blount&#x27;s accompanying steam museum. The MS&amp;N operated in the region until 1967, when it was folded in with the Green Mountain Railroad. An image of the peak made up the railroad&#x27;s logo.

==Other nearby peaks named Monadnock==
* Pack Monadnock and North Pack Monadnock are two peaks in the Wapack Range, to the east across the Contoocook River valley from Mount Monadnock, in Greenfield and Peterborough, New Hampshire. &quot;Pack&quot; is a Native American word for &quot;little&quot;.
* Little Monadnock Mountain is a peak located southwest of Mount Monadnock in Troy and Fitzwilliam, New Hampshire. Like Mount Monadnock, it is crossed by the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail.
* Monadnock Mountain is the name of a mountain in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.

<text>The Zeeman effect () is the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field. It is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atomic electron associated with its orbital motion and spin; this interaction shifts some orbital energies more than others, resulting in the split spectrum. The effect is named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, who discovered it in 1896 and received a Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery. It is analogous to the Stark effect, the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of an electric field. Also, similar to the Stark effect, transitions between different components have, in general, different intensities, with some being entirely forbidden (in the dipole approximation), as governed by the selection rules.

Since the distance between the Zeeman sub-levels is a function of magnetic field strength, this effect can be used to measure magnetic field strength, e.g. that of the Sun and other stars or in laboratory plasmas.

==Discovery==
In 1896 Zeeman learned that his laboratory had one of Henry Augustus Rowland&#x27;s highest resolving diffraction gratings. Zeeman had read James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s article in &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describing Michael Faraday&#x27;s failed attempts to influence light with magnetism. Zeeman wondered if the new spectrographic techniques could succeed where early efforts had not.

When illuminated by a slit-shaped source, the grating produces a long array of slit images corresponding to different wavelengths. Zeeman placed a piece of asbestos soaked in salt water into a Bunsen burner flame at the source of the grating: he could easily see two lines for sodium light emission. Energizing a 10-kilogauss magnet around the flame, he observed a slight broadening of the sodium images.

When Zeeman switched to cadmium as the source, he observed the images split when the magnet was energized. These splittings could be analyzed with Hendrik Lorentz&#x27;s then-new electron theory. In retrospect, we now know that the magnetic effects on sodium require quantum-mechanical treatment. Zeeman and Lorentz were awarded the 1902 Nobel Prize; in his acceptance speech Zeeman explained his apparatus and showed slides of the spectrographic images.

==Nomenclature==
Historically, one distinguishes between the normal and an anomalous Zeeman effect (discovered by Thomas Preston in Dublin, Ireland). The anomalous effect appears on transitions where the net spin of the electrons is non-zero. It was called &quot;anomalous&quot; because the electron spin had not yet been discovered, and so there was no good explanation for it at the time that Zeeman observed the effect. Wolfgang Pauli recalled that when asked by a colleague as to why he looked unhappy, he replied: &quot;How can one look happy when he is thinking about the anomalous Zeeman effect?&quot;

At higher magnetic field strength the effect ceases to be linear. At even higher field strengths, comparable to the strength of the atom&#x27;s internal field, the electron coupling is disturbed and the spectral lines rearrange. This is called the Paschen–Back effect.

In modern scientific literature, these terms are rarely used, with a tendency to use just the &quot;Zeeman effect&quot;. Another rarely used obscure term is inverse Zeeman effect, referring to the Zeeman effect in an absorption spectral line.

A similar effect, splitting of the &quot;nuclear&quot; energy levels in the presence of a magnetic field, is referred to as the nuclear Zeeman effect.

==Theoretical presentation==
The total Hamiltonian of an atom in a magnetic field is
formula_1
where formula_2 is the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the atom, and formula_3 is the perturbation due to the magnetic field:
formula_4
where formula_5 is the magnetic moment of the atom. The magnetic moment consists of the electronic and nuclear parts; however, the latter is many orders of magnitude smaller and will be neglected here. Therefore,
formula_6
where formula_7 is the Bohr magneton, formula_8 is the total electronic angular momentum, and formula_9 is the Landé g-factor.

A more accurate approach is to take into account that the operator of the magnetic moment of an electron is a sum of the contributions of the orbital angular momentum formula_10 and the spin angular momentum formula_11, with each multiplied by the appropriate gyromagnetic ratio:
formula_12
where formula_13, and formula_14 (the anomalous gyromagnetic ratio, deviating from 2 due to the effects of quantum electrodynamics). In the case of the LS coupling, one can sum over all electrons in the atom:
formula_15
where formula_16 and formula_17 are the total spin momentum and spin of the atom, and averaging is done over a state with a given value of the total angular momentum.

If the interaction term formula_3 is small (less than the fine structure), it can be treated as a perturbation; this is the Zeeman effect proper. In the Paschen–Back effect, described below, formula_3 exceeds the LS coupling significantly (but is still small compared to formula_2). In ultra-strong magnetic fields, the magnetic-field interaction may exceed formula_2, in which case the atom can no longer exist in its normal meaning, and one talks about Landau levels instead. There are intermediate cases that are more complex than these limit cases.

==Weak field (Zeeman effect)==
If the spin–orbit interaction dominates over the effect of the external magnetic field, formula_10 and formula_11 are not separately conserved, only the total angular momentum formula_24 is. The spin and orbital angular momentum vectors can be thought of as precessing about the (fixed) total angular momentum vector formula_25. The (time-)&quot;averaged&quot; spin vector is then the projection of the spin onto the direction of formula_25:
formula_27
and for the (time-)&quot;averaged&quot; orbital vector:
formula_28

Thus
formula_29
Using formula_30 and squaring both sides, we get
formula_31
and using formula_32 and squaring both sides, we get
formula_33

Combining everything and taking formula_34, we obtain the magnetic potential energy of the atom in the applied external magnetic field:
formula_35
where the quantity in square brackets is the Landé g-factor formula_36 of the atom (formula_37 formula_38), and formula_39 is the &quot;z&quot; component of the total angular momentum. 

For a single electron above filled shells, with formula_40 and formula_41, the Landé g-factor can be simplified to
formula_42

Taking formula_3 to be the perturbation, the Zeeman correction to the energy is
formula_44

===Example: Lyman-alpha transition in hydrogen===
The Lyman-alpha transition in hydrogen in the presence of the spin–orbit interaction involves the transitions formula_45 and formula_46

In the presence of an external magnetic field, the weak-field Zeeman effect splits the formula_47 and formula_48 levels into 2 states each (formula_49) and the formula_50 level into 4 states (formula_51). The Landé g-factors for the three levels are
formula_52
Note in particular that the size of the energy splitting is different for the different orbitals because the &quot;gJ&quot; values are different. Fine-structure splitting occurs even in the absence of a magnetic field, as it is due to spin–orbit coupling. Depicted on the right is the additional Zeeman splitting, which occurs in the presence of magnetic fields.

==Strong field (Paschen–Back effect)==
The Paschen–Back effect is the splitting of atomic energy levels in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This occurs when an external magnetic field is sufficiently strong to disrupt the coupling between orbital (formula_16) and spin (formula_17) angular momenta. This effect is the strong-field limit of the Zeeman effect. When formula_55, the two effects are equivalent. The effect was named after the German physicists Friedrich Paschen and Ernst E. A. Back.

When the magnetic-field perturbation significantly exceeds the spin–orbit interaction, one can safely assume formula_56. This allows the expectation values of formula_57 and formula_58 to be easily evaluated for a state formula_59. The energies are simply

:formula_60

The above may be read as implying that the LS-coupling is completely broken by the external field. However, formula_61 and formula_62 are still &quot;good&quot; quantum numbers. Together with the selection rules for an electric dipole transition, i.e., formula_63 this allows to ignore the spin degree of freedom altogether. As a result, only three spectral lines will be visible, corresponding to the formula_64 selection rule. The splitting formula_65 is &quot;independent&quot; of the unperturbed energies and electronic configurations of the levels being considered.

More precisely, if formula_66, each of these three components is actually a group of several transitions due to the residual spin–orbit coupling and relativistic corrections (which are of the same order, known as &#x27;fine structure&#x27;). The first-order perturbation theory with these corrections yields the following formula for the hydrogen atom in the Paschen–Back limit:
:formula_67

===Example: Lyman-alpha transition in hydrogen===
In this example, the fine-structure corrections are ignored.


== Intermediate field for j = 1/2 ==
In the magnetic dipole approximation, the Hamiltonian which includes both the hyperfine and Zeeman interactions is 
:formula_68
:formula_69
where formula_70 is the hyperfine splitting (in Hz) at zero applied magnetic field, formula_71 and formula_72 are the Bohr magneton and nuclear magneton respectively, formula_25 and formula_74 are the electron and nuclear angular momentum operators and formula_36 is the Landé g-factor:
formula_76

In the case of weak magnetic fields, the Zeeman interaction can be treated as a perturbation to the formula_77 basis. In the high field regime, the magnetic field becomes so strong that the Zeeman effect will dominate, and one must use a more complete basis of formula_78 or just formula_79 since formula_80 and formula_81 will be constant within a given level. 
To get the complete picture, including intermediate field strengths, we must consider eigenstates which are superpositions of the formula_82 and formula_83 basis states. For formula_84, the Hamiltonian can be solved analytically, resulting in the Breit–Rabi formula (named after Gregory Breit and Isidor Isaac Rabi). Notably, the electric quadrupole interaction is zero for formula_85 (formula_84), so this formula is fairly accurate.

We now utilize quantum mechanical ladder operators, which are defined for a general angular momentum operator formula_87 as

:formula_88

These ladder operators have the property
:formula_89

as long as formula_90 lies in the range formula_91 (otherwise, they return zero). Using ladder operators formula_92 and formula_93 
We can rewrite the Hamiltonian as

:formula_94

We can now see that at all times, the total angular momentum projection formula_95 will be conserved. This is because both formula_96 and formula_97 leave states with definite formula_98 and formula_99 unchanged, while formula_100 and formula_101 either increase formula_98 and decrease formula_99 or vice versa, so the sum is always unaffected. Furthermore, since formula_84 there are only two possible values of formula_105 which are formula_106. Therefore, for every value of formula_107 there are only two possible states, and we can define them as the basis:

:formula_108

This pair of states is a two-level quantum mechanical system. Now we can determine the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian:

:formula_109
:formula_110

Solving for the eigenvalues of this matrix – as can be done by hand (see two-level quantum mechanical system), or more easily, with a computer algebra system – we arrive at the energy shifts:

:formula_111
:formula_112

where formula_113 is the splitting (in units of Hz) between two hyperfine sublevels in the absence of magnetic field formula_114,
formula_115 is referred to as the &#x27;field strength parameter&#x27; (Note: for formula_116 the expression under the square root is an exact square, and so the last term should be replaced by formula_117). This equation is known as the Breit–Rabi formula and is useful for systems with one valence electron in an formula_118 (formula_84) level.

Note that index formula_120 in formula_121 should be considered not as total angular momentum of the atom but as &quot;asymptotic total angular momentum&quot;. It is equal to total angular momentum only if formula_122
otherwise eigenvectors corresponding different eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are the superpositions of states with different formula_120 but equal formula_124 (the only exceptions are formula_125).

==Applications==

===Astrophysics===

George Ellery Hale was the first to notice the Zeeman effect in the solar spectra, indicating the existence of strong magnetic fields in sunspots. Such fields can be quite high, on the order of 0.1 tesla or higher. Today, the Zeeman effect is used to produce magnetograms showing the variation of magnetic field on the Sun, and to analyze the magnetic field geometries in other stars.

===Laser cooling===
The Zeeman effect is utilized in many laser cooling applications such as a magneto-optical trap and the Zeeman slower.

===Spintronics===
Zeeman-energy mediated coupling of spin and orbital motions
is used in spintronics for controlling electron spins in quantum dots through electric dipole spin resonance.

===Metrology===
Old high-precision frequency standards, i.e. hyperfine structure transition-based atomic clocks, may require periodic fine-tuning due to exposure to magnetic fields. This is carried out by measuring the Zeeman effect on specific hyperfine structure transition levels of the source element (cesium) and applying a uniformly precise, low-strength magnetic field to said source, in a process known as degaussing.

The Zeeman effect may also be utilized to improve accuracy in atomic absorption spectroscopy.

===Biology===
A theory about the magnetic sense of birds assumes that a protein in the retina is changed due to the Zeeman effect.

===Nuclear spectroscopy===
The nuclear Zeeman effect is important in such applications as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Mössbauer spectroscopy.

===Other===
The electron spin resonance spectroscopy is based on the Zeeman effect.

== Demonstrations ==

The Zeeman effect can be demonstrated by placing a sodium vapor source in a powerful electromagnet and viewing a sodium vapor lamp through the magnet opening (see diagram). With magnet off, the sodium vapor source will block the lamp light; when the magnet is turned on the lamp light will be visible through the vapor.

The sodium vapor can be created by sealing sodium metal in an evacuated glass tube and heating it while the tube is in the magnet.

Alternatively, salt (sodium chloride) on a ceramic stick can be placed in the flame of Bunsen burner as the sodium vapor source. When the magnetic field is energized, the lamp image will be brighter. However, the magnetic field also affects the flame, making the observation depend upon more than just the Zeeman effect. These issues also plagued Zeeman&#x27;s original work; he devoted considerable effort to ensure his observations were truly an effect of magnetism on light emission.

When salt is added to the Bunsen burner, it dissociates to give sodium and chloride. The sodium atoms get excited due to photons from the sodium vapour lamp, with electrons excited from 3s to 3p states, absorbing light in the process. The sodium vapour lamp emits light at 589nm, which has precisely the energy to excite an electron of a sodium atom. If it was an atom of another element, like chlorine, shadow will not be formed. When a magnetic field is applied, due to the Zeeman effect the spectral line of sodium gets split into several components. This means the energy difference between the 3s and 3p atomic orbitals will change. As the sodium vapour lamp don&#x27;t precisely deliver the right frequency anymore, light doesn&#x27;t get absorbed and passes through, resulting in the shadow dimming. As the magnetic field strength is increased, the shift in the spectral lines increases and lamp light is transmitted.

<text>The University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School (also known as Penn Carey Law, or Penn Law) is the law school of the University of Pennsylvania, a private Ivy League research university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Penn Carey Law offers the degrees of Juris Doctor (J.D.), Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Comparative Laws (LL.C.M.), Master in Law (M.L.), and Doctor of the Science of Law (S.J.D.).

The entering class typically consists of approximately 250 students and admission is highly selective. Penn Carey Law&#x27;s 2020 weighted first-time bar passage rate was 98.5 percent. For the class of 2024, 49 percent of students were women, 40 percent identified as persons of color, and 12 percent of students enrolled with an advanced degree.

Among the school&#x27;s alumni are a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, at least 76 judges of United States court system, 12 state Supreme Court Justices (with 6 serving as Chief Justice), 3 supreme court justices of foreign countries, at least 46 members of United States Congress as well as 9 Olympians, 5 of whom won 13 medals, several founders of law firms, university presidents and deans, business entrepreneurs, leaders in the public sector, and government officials.

==History==
===18th century===
The University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School traces its origins to a series of &quot;Lectures on Law&quot; delivered in 1790 through 1792 by James Wilson, one of only six signers of the United States Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution. Wilson is credited with being one of the two primary authors (the other being James Madison) of the first draft of such constitution, due to his membership on the Committee of Detail established by the United States Constitutional Convention on July 24, 1787, to draft a text reflecting the agreements made by the Convention up to that point. 
As a professor at Penn, Wilson gave these lectures on law to President George Washington and Vice President John Adams and the rest of George Washington&#x27;s cabinet, including Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. Wilson was one of the original five U.S. Supreme Court associate justices nominated by George Washington and confirmed by the U.S. Senate via unanimous voice vote on September 26, 1789. In 1792, Wilson was appointed as Penn&#x27;s first full professor of law and remained a Professor at Penn through the date of his death in 1798.

===19th century===

In 1817, Penn trustees appointed Charles Willing Hare as the second professor of law. Hare taught for one year before becoming &quot;afflicted with loss of reason.&quot;

Penn began offering a full-time program in law in 1850, under the leadership of the third professor of law at the Law Department of the University of Pennsylvania, George Sharswood. Sharswood was also named Dean of Penn&#x27;s Law School in 1852 and served through 1867, and was later appointed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (1879 - 1882). 

In 1852, Penn was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal. Then called &quot;The American Law Register&quot;, the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot; is the nation&#x27;s oldest law review and one of the most-cited law journals in the world.

In 1881, Carrie Burnham Kilgore became the first woman admitted to, and, in 1883, to graduate from, Penn Law, and subsequently became first woman admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania. 

In 1888, Aaron Albert Mossell became the first African-American man to earn a law degree from Penn. Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, Mossell&#x27;s daughter, was awarded the Frances Sergeant Pepper fellowship in 1921 and subsequently became the first African-American to receive a PhD in economics in the United States, a degree she earned at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1927, Alexander became the first African-American woman to graduate from Penn Law and in 1929, she became the first African-American woman to be admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania.

William Draper Lewis was named dean of Penn&#x27;s law department in 1896 and founded the American Law Institute.

===20th century===
In 1900, the trustees of the University of Pennsylvania approved his and others&#x27; request to move the Law School to the core of campus and to its current location at the intersection of 34th and Chestnut Streets. Under Lewis&#x27; deanship, the Law School was one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today. 

As legal education became more formalized, the school initiated a three-year curriculum and instituted stringent admissions requirements.

After 30 years with the Law School, Lewis founded the American Law Institute (ALI) in 1925, which was seated in the Law School and was chaired by Lewis himself. The ALI was later chaired by another Penn Law Dean, Herbert Funk Goodrich and Penn Law Professors George Wharton Pepper and Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr.

In 1969, Martha Field became the first woman to join the faculty at the Law School at Penn; she is now a professor at Harvard Law School. Other notable women who have been or are presently professors at Penn Carey Law include Lani Guinier, Elizabeth Warren, Anita L. Allen, and Dorothy Roberts.

From 1974 to 1978, the dean of the Law School was Louis Pollak, who later became a federal judge. Since Pollak ascended to the bench, Penn Law&#x27;s deans have included James O. Freedman, former president of Dartmouth College, Colin Diver, former president of Reed College, and Michael Fitts, current president of Tulane University.

===21st century===
In November 2019, the Law School received a $125 million donation from the W.P. Carey Foundation, the largest single donation to any law school to date; the school was renamed University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, in honor of the foundation&#x27;s first president, alumnus Francis J. Carey (1926–2014), who was the brother of William Polk Carey (1930 - 2012), founder of the W. P. Carey Inc. REIT, and of the charitable foundation. The change was met by some controversy, and a petition to quash the abbreviated &quot;Carey Law&quot;, in favor of the traditional &quot;Penn Law&quot;, was circulated and it was agreed that the official short form name for the next few years could remain &quot;Penn Law&quot; and/or &quot;Penn Carey Law&quot;.

Osagie O. Imasogie, a 1985 graduate of Penn Law, is the current Chair of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School Board of Overseers, having replaced Perry Golkin on January 1, 2021. Imasogie has been a member of Penn Law School Board of Overseers since 2006 and more recently a Trustee on the Board of Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. Imasogie, a graduate of two law schools in Nigeria and London School of Economics and Political Science, has held senior positions with a diverse group of professional services and bio-tech companies such as GSK, DuPont, Merck, Price Waterhouse, Schnader Harrison Segal &amp; Lewis and is presently an adjunct professor at Penn Law, where he teaches a seminar on “Intellectual Property and National Economic Value Creation”. He is the first African-born chair of an American law school.

Except for the period of time during which the Law School&#x27;s policy prohibited military recruiters from recruiting on the law school campus, when the military openly refused to hire gays, bisexuals and lesbians, Penn Carey Law has actively supported the armed forces. The Harold Cramer Memorial Scholarship Program was established in June 2021 to ensure that all veterans admitted to the Law School will be able to afford to attend.

==Campus==

The University of Pennsylvania campus covers over 269 acres (~1 km2) in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia&#x27;s University City district. All of Penn&#x27;s schools, including the law school, and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. Much of Penn&#x27;s architecture was designed by the architecture firm of Cope &amp; Stewardson, whose principal architects combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.

The law school consists of four interconnecting buildings around a central courtyard. At the east end of the courtyard is Silverman Hall, built in 1900, housing the Levy Conference Center, classrooms, faculty offices, the Gittis Center for Clinical Legal Studies, and administrative and student offices. Directly opposite is Tanenbaum Hall, home to the Biddle Law Library, several law journals, administrative offices, and student spaces. The law library houses 1,053,824 volumes and volume equivalents making it the 4th-largest law library in the country. Gittis Hall sits on the north side and has new classrooms (renovated in 2006) and new and expanded faculty offices. Opposite is Golkin Hall, which contains and includes a state-of-the-art court room, 350-seat auditorium, seminar rooms, faculty and administrative offices, a two-story entry hall, and a rooftop garden.

A small row of restaurants and shops faces the law school on Sansom Street. Nearby are the Penn Bookstore, the Pottruck Center (a multi-purpose sports activity area), the Institute of Contemporary Art, a performing arts center, and area shops.

==Academics==

===Admissions===
For the J.D. class entering in the fall of 2022, 9.74 percent out of 6,816 applicants were offered admission, with 246 matriculating. The class boasted 25th and 75th LSAT percentiles of 166 and 173, respectively, with a median of 172. The 25th and 75th undergraduate GPA percentiles were 3.61 and 3.96, respectively, with a median of 3.90. 13 percent of matriculating students identified as first-generation college students, and 35 percent identified as first-generation professional school students.

Over 1,250 students from 70 countries applied to Penn&#x27;s LLM program for the fall of 2019. The incoming class consisted of 126 students from more than 30 countries.

The entering class typically consists of approximately 250 students, and admission is highly competitive. Penn Law&#x27;s July 2018 weighted first-time bar passage rate was 92.09%. The law school is one of the &quot;T14&quot; law schools, that is, schools that have consistently ranked within the top 14 law schools since &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; began publishing rankings. In the class entering in 2018, over half of students were women, over a third identified as persons of color, and 10% of students enrolled with an advanced degree.

Based on student survey responses, ABA and NALP data; 99.6 percent of the Class of 2020 obtained full-time employment after graduation. The median salary for the Class of 2019 was $190,000, as 75.2 percent of students joined law firms and 11.6 percent obtained judicial clerkships. The law school was ranked #2 of all law schools nationwide by the &quot;National Law Journal&quot;, for sending the highest percentage of 2019 graduates to join the 100 largest law firms in the U.S., constituting 58.4 percent.

===Multidisciplinary Focus===
Throughout its modern history, Penn has been known for its strong focus on inter-disciplinary studies, a character that was shaped early on by Dean William Draper Lewis. Its medium-size student body and the tight integration with the rest of Penn&#x27;s schools (the &quot;One University Policy&quot;) have been instrumental in achieving that aim. More than 50 percent of the Law School&#x27;s courses are interdisciplinary, and it offers more than 20 joint and dual degree programs, including a JD/MBA (Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania), a JD/PhD in Communication (Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania), and a JD/MD (Perelman School of Medicine).

Various certificate programs that can be completed within the three-year JD program, e.g. in Business and Public Policy, in conjunction with the Wharton School), in Cross-Sector Innovation with the School of Social Policy &amp; Practice, in International Business and Law with the Themis Joint Certificate with ESADE Law School in Barcelona, Spain, and in Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN). 19 percent of the Class of 2007 earned a certificate. 57 percent of the Class of 2020 and 52 percent of the Class of 2021 pursued a certificate.

Penn Law also offers joint degrees with international affiliates, such as Sciences Po (France), ESADE (Spain), and the University of Hong Kong Faculty of Law. The School has further expanded its international programs with the addition of the International Internship Program, the International Summer Human Rights Program, and the Global Research Seminar, all under the umbrella of the Penn Law Global Initiative. Penn Law takes part in a number of international annual events, such as the Monroe E. Price Media Law Moot Court Competition at the University of Oxford and the Waseda Transnational Program at the Waseda Law School in Tokyo.

===Clinics and externships===
For more than 40 years, students in Penn Law’s Gittis Center for Clinical Legal Studies have had the opportunity to learn valuable practical legal skills and put theory into practice while helping many clients in the community. The Law School offers in-house clinics, including: civil practice, criminal defense, the Detkin intellectual property and technology legal clinic, entrepreneurship, interdisciplinary child advocacy, legislative, mediation, and transnational. Students can also receive credit for completing externships with non-profit and government institutes such as the ACLU of Pennsylvania or the City of Philadelphia Law Department.

===Toll Public Interest Center and related activities===
Penn was the first national law school to establish a mandatory pro bono program, and the first law school to win the American Bar Association&#x27;s Pro Bono Publico Award. The public interest center was founded in 1989 and was renamed the Toll Public Interest Center in 2006 in acknowledgement of a $10 million gift from Robert Toll (Executive Chairman of the Board of Toll Brothers) and Jane Toll. In 2011, the Tolls donated an additional $2.5 million. In October 2020, The Robert and Jane Toll Foundation announced that it was donating fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) to Penn Law, which is the largest gift in history to be devoted entirely to the training and support of public interest lawyers, and among the ten (10) largest gifts ever to a law school in the United States of America. The gift expands the Toll Public Interest Scholars and Fellows Program by doubling the number of public interest graduates in the coming decade through a combination of full and partial tuition scholarships. The Toll Public Interest Center has supported many students who have pursued public interest fellowships and work following graduation.

Students complete 70 hours of pro bono service as a condition of graduation. More than half of the Class of 2021 substantially exceeded the requirement. Students can create their own placements, or work through over 30 student-led organizations that focus their pro bono service in a variety of substantive areas.

The Law School awards Toll Public Interest Scholarships to accomplished public interest matriculants, and has a generous Public Interest Loan Repayment Program for graduates pursuing careers in public interest. Students interested in public interest work receive funding for summer positions through money from the student-run Equal Justice Foundation or via funding from Penn Law. Additionally, the Law School funds students interested in working internationally through the International Human Rights Fellowship.

===Centers and Institutes===
Penn Law hosts eleven different academic centers, institutes, programs, and research groups wherein students and faculty work together on interdisciplinary scholarship. Notable among them are the Penn Program on Regulation, directed by professor of law and political science Cary Coglianese; the Quattrone Center for the Fair Administration of Justice, directed by Faculty Director Paul Heaton. Other Centers and Institutes include: Center for Asian Law; Center for Technology, Innovation, and Competition; Institute for Law and Economics; Institute for Law and Philosophy; Criminal Law Research Group; Legal History Consortium; Center for Tax Law and Policy; and Penn Program on Documentaries and the Law.

===Biddle Law Library===
Penn’s Law library holds over one million volumes, mostly consisting of American primary and secondary materials. Approximately one-third of the Library’s collection is composed of foreign, international, and comparative legal texts. The Library also holds subscriptions for digital resources such as LexisNexis, Westlaw, and Bloomberg Law, which provide students and faculty with access to wide breadth of journal articles, treatises, and case texts.

Biddle is also home to archives from both the American Law Institute and the American College of Bankruptcy. Biddle also holds Penn Law’s own archival collection, which consists of manuscripts, rare books, oral histories, and certain Penn Law school records.

===Journals===
Students at the law school publish several legal journals. The flagship publication is the &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot;, the oldest law review in the United States. The &quot;University of Pennsylvania Law Review&quot; started in 1852 as the &quot;American Law Register&quot;, and was renamed to its current title in 1908. It is one of the most frequently cited law journals in the world, and one of the four journals that are responsible for &quot;The Bluebook&quot;, along with the Harvard, Yale, and Columbia law journals. &quot;Penn Law Review&quot; articles have captured seminal historical moments in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment; the lawlessness of the first and second World Wars; the rise of the civil rights movement; and the war in Vietnam.

Other law journals include:
*&quot;University of Pennsylvania Journal of Constitutional Law&quot;, one of the top 50 law journals in the United States based on citations and impact.
*&quot;University of Pennsylvania Journal of International Law&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Journal of International Economic Law&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Journal of International Business Law&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Journal of Comparative Business and Capital Market Law&quot;
*&quot;University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business Law&quot;, formerly known as &quot;Journal of Business and Employment Law&quot;
*&quot;University of Pennsylvania Journal of Law and Social Change&quot;
*&quot;Asian Law Review&quot;, formerly known as &quot;East Asian Law Review,&quot; formerly known as &quot;Chinese Law and Policy Review&quot;
*&quot;Journal of Law &amp; Public Affairs&quot;

==U.S. Supreme Court clerkships==
Since 2000, Penn has had seven alumni serve as judicial clerks at the United States Supreme Court. This record gives Penn a ranking of 10th among all law schools for supplying such law clerks for the period 2000-2019. Penn has placed 48 clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court in its history, ranked 11th among law schools; this group includes Curtis R. Reitz, who is the Algernon Sydney Biddle Professor of Law, Emeritus at Penn.

==Employment==
According to ABA and NALP data, 99.6 percent of the Class of 2020 obtained full-time employment after graduation. The median salary for the Class of 2019 was $190,000, as 75.2 percent of students joined law firms and 11.6 percent obtained a judicial clerkship. Penn combines a strong tradition in public service with being one of the top feeders of law students to the most prestigious law firms. Penn Law was the first top-ranked law school to establish a mandatory pro bono requirement, and the first law school to win American Bar Association&#x27;s Pro Bono Publico Award. Many students pursue public interest careers with the support of fellowship grants such as the Skadden Fellowship, called by &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; &quot;a legal Peace Corps.&quot;

About 75 percent of each graduating class enters private practice, bringing with them the ethos of pro bono service. In 2020, the Law School placed more than 70 percent of its graduates into the United States&#x27; top law firms, maintaining Penn&#x27;s rank as the number one law school in the nation for the percentage of students securing employment at these top law firms. The Law School was ranked #4 of all law schools nationwide by Law.com in terms of sending the highest percentage of 2021 graduates to the largest 100 law firms in the U.S. (55 percent).

Based on student survey responses, ABA, and NALP data, 99.2% of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time employment after graduation, with a median salary of $180,000, as 76% of students joined law firms and 11% obtained judicial clerkships.

==Costs==

<doc id="176402" wikidata="Q3533284" url="?curid=176402" title="Butterfly bend">
<text>The butterfly bend is a knot used to join the ends of two ropes together. It is the analogous bend form of the butterfly loop, in that it is the butterfly loop with the loop cut. The observation that the butterfly loop is secure enough to isolate a worn or damaged section of rope within the loop indicated that the bend form of the knot would be similarly secure.

==History==

When Phil D. Smith made the first known presentation of the Hunter&#x27;s bend in 1953 (under the name &quot;rigger&#x27;s bend&quot;), he described it as a modification to the butterfly bend. While the bend form had been known to mountaineers, nautical rigger Brion Toss brought the knot to a wider audience when he published it in 1975. Unaware of the earlier publication, Toss called the butterfly bend the strait bend after the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

==Tying==
The butterfly bend can be tied using a subset of the methods used for tying the loop form by holding the two rope ends together and treating them as if they were a single bight. However, specific methods have been developed for tying the bend form directly, including the one shown below and characterizable using the mnemonic device &quot;A &quot;d&quot; through a &quot;b&quot;; &#x27;twixt the two and toward me&quot;:

==Security==
A properly tied butterfly bend should be as secure as the equivalent loop form. However, subtle positioning errors during the above shown tying method can result in a similar looking but insecure bend knot.

<doc id="176404" wikidata="Q5171115" url="?curid=176404" title="Corned beef knot">
<text>The corned beef knot is a binding knot usually made in small line or string. It gains its name by often being used for binding the meat of the same name while it is being cooked. Since corned beef shrinks during cooking, the knot needs to be tightened several times during the process.

==Tying==
A buntline hitch is tied to the standing part and moderately tightened. The binding itself is tightened as the meat cooks by sliding the buntline hitch on the standing part. The knot is finished by a half hitch around the &quot;working end&quot; only after the meat has fully shrunk. It is considered more secure and suitable for this task than the related packer&#x27;s knot.

<doc id="176405" wikidata="Q7122943" url="?curid=176405" title="Packer's knot">
<text>The packer&#x27;s knot is a binding knot which is easily pulled taut and quickly locked in position. It is most often made in small line or string, such as that used for hand baling, parcel tying, and binding roasts. This latter use, and its general form, make it a member of a class of similar knots known as butcher&#x27;s knots. 

==Tying and variations==

A lightly tightened figure-eight knot is formed around the standing part of the line such that both ends emerge from the same point. Pulling on the standing part tightens the binding. After the desired degree of tension is reached, a locking half-hitch is added over the working end and pulled taut.

Even without the locking half-hitch the knot will generally maintain tension while additional tying is accomplished, such as putting a second, perpendicular, wrap on a package.

A similar knot made with an overhand knot instead of a figure-eight works almost as well. Many other variations also exist finishing with this style of locking half-hitch. In fact, Clifford Ashley claimed that there were more knots of this type to be found than any other used for a single purpose.

<text>The pile hitch is a kind of hitch, which is a knot used for attaching rope to a pole or other structure. The pile hitch is very easy to tie and can be tied in the bight, without access to either end of the rope, making it a valuable tool.

== Tying ==
To tie, form a loop in the bight, and wrap both strands of this loop around the pole near the pole&#x27;s end. Pull the loop around and under the rope, then finish by putting the loop itself around the end of the pole.

<text>The sailor&#x27;s hitch is a secure, jam-proof hitch knot. A hitch knot is a type of knot that has the ability to fit to the size and shape of an object that it is being tied to. 

The sailor&#x27;s hitch is similar in function and appearance to the swing hitch.

The sailor&#x27;s hitch can be used in such a way that allows a smaller rope to be attached to a large rope. The smaller rope should be pulled to the left while the bight should go through the final tuck to form the final product of a sailor&#x27;s hitch. 

This knot can also serve the purpose of a cleat hitch. 

There is another variation of the knot with several more turns that is called the gripping sailor&#x27;s hitch. The gripping sailor&#x27;s hitch is commonly confused with the icicle hitch, but it has distinctions with the last tuck of the knot that allows them to be different.

The sailor&#x27;s knot is used in the following circumstances:

*search and rescue
*mountaineering
*climbing
*boating
*horse and livestock
*camping
*scouting

<text>The timber hitch is a knot used to attach a single length of rope to a cylindrical object. Secure while tension is maintained, it is easily untied even after heavy loading.

The timber hitch is a very old knot. It is first known to have been mentioned in a nautical source c. 1625 and illustrated in 1762.

==Usage==

As the name suggests, this knot is often used by lumbermen and arborists for attaching ropes or chains to tree trunks, branches, and logs. For stability when towing or lowering long items, the addition of a half-hitch in front of the timber hitch creates a timber hitch and a half hitch, or known as a killick hitch when at sea. A killick is &quot;a small anchor or weight for mooring a boat, sometimes consisting of a stone secured by pieces of wood&quot;. This can also prevent the timber hitch from rolling. The timber hitch is one of the few knots that can easily be tied in a chain, leading to its use in applications where ropes lack the necessary strength and would break under the same amount of tension.

This knot is also known as the Bowyer&#x27;s Knot, as it is used to attach the lower end of the bowstring to the bottom limb on an English longbow.

The hitch is also one of the methods used to connect ukulele and classical guitar strings to the bridge of the instruments.

==Tying==
To make the knot, pass the rope completely around the object. Pass the running end around the standing part, then through the loop just formed. Make three or more turns (or twists) around the working part. Pull on the standing part to tighten around the object.

A common error in tying can be avoided by assuring that the turns are made in the working part around itself. When making the hitch in laid rope, the turns should be made with the lay of the rope, that is, in the same direction as the twist of the rope.

==Security==
Although &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot; states that &quot;three tucks or turns are ample&quot;, this work was written prior to the wide use of synthetic fiber cordage. Later sources suggest five or more turns may be required for full security in modern synthetic ropes.

== ABoK Context ==

The Timber Hitches list almost immediately in &quot;CHAPTER 21: HITCHES TO SPAR AND RAIL (RIGHT-ANGLE PULL)&quot;, only preceded there by 3 Half Hitch base forms. The context begins with typical Half Hitch#1662 as worst security/nip warnings warning with Skull/Crossbones, but a base structure to build on. Then shows the most security at top nip/opposing the linear load pull position as a safer Half Hitch form#1663 awarding Anchor icon if constant pull. Then introduces Timber Hitch #1665 concept from extension of worst nip Half Hitch tail#1662 . #1666 then shows Fig.8 concept as upgrade to Half Hitch#1662 and shows the nip position pushed to halfway between normal and top nip Half Hitch. Also adds a geometric consideration of:&quot;particularly if the encompassed object is small.&quot; of even higher nip. #1668 then shows the Fig.8 Timber Hitch with nip more to side and not bottom as improvement.

Next trick is in #1669 Fig.8 Hitch with Round Turn. Where the Round Turn is around the Standing Part and Fig.8 portion actually pictured as fig.8 Timber Hitch and so adds that the &quot;Round Turn on the Standing Part adds materially to the strength of the knot.&quot;

Next chapter is &quot;CHAPTER 22: HITCHES TO MASTS, RIGGING, AND CABLE (LENGTHWISE PULL) To withstand a lengthwise pull without slipping is about the most that can be asked of a hitch. Great care must be exercised in tying the following series of knots, and the impossible must not be expected&quot; that starts off with a Timber Hitch preceded by &#x27;lengthwise&#x27; Half Hitch form to convert Timber from &quot;RIGHT-ANGLE PULL&quot; to &quot;LENGTHWISE PULL&quot; usage in the back to back chapters.

<text>Nils Hilmer Lofgren (born June 21, 1951) is an American rock musician, recording artist, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. Along with his work as a solo artist, he has been a member of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band since 1984, a member of Crazy Horse, and founder/frontman of the band Grin. Lofgren was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band in 2014.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Lofgren was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States, to an Italian mother and a Swedish father. When he was a young child, the family moved to the Washington, D.C., suburb of Bethesda, Maryland. Lofgren&#x27;s first instrument was classical accordion, beginning at age five, which he studied seriously for ten years. After studying classical music and jazz, throughout his youth, Lofgren switched his emphasis to rock music, and focused on the piano and the guitar.

Lofgren attended his local public high school, Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda, Maryland, although he did not graduate, dropping out in 1968 at age 17 to pursue a career in music. He had been a competitive gymnast in high school, a skill that was used on stage later in his performing career and reflected in the name of his 1985 album, &quot;Flip&quot;.

===Grin===
In 1968, Lofgren formed the band Grin with bassist George Daly and drummer Bob Berberich. Daly and Berberich were former players in the DC band The Hangmen. The group played in venues throughout the Washington, D.C., area. 

Lofgren met Neil Young while Young was performing at the Georgetown club The Cellar Door, and began a long association. Young invited Lofgren to come to California and the Grin trio (Lofgren, Daly and Berberich) drove out west and lived for some months at a home Neil Young rented in Laurel Canyon. Lofgren would eventually use his album credits from working with Young to land Grin a record deal in 1971.

Daly left the band early on to become a Columbia Records A&amp;R Executive and was replaced by bassist Bob Gordon, who remained through the release of four critically acclaimed albums of catchy hard rock from 1971 to 1974, with guitar as Lofgren&#x27;s primary instrument. The single &quot;White Lies&quot; got heavy airplay on Washington, D.C.-area radio. Lofgren wrote the majority of the group&#x27;s songs, and often shared vocal duties with other members of the band (primarily drummer Bob Berberich). After the second album he added brother Tom Lofgren as a rhythm guitarist. Grin were released by their record company due to disappointing sales and success.

===Neil Young and Crazy Horse===
Lofgren joined Neil Young at age 19 to play piano and guitar on the album &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;. Lofgren maintained his musical relationship with Young, appearing as a part of the Santa Monica Flyers on Young&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; album and tour, and again on the &quot;Trans&quot; album and tour. He has also been a recurring member of Crazy Horse (1970–1971; 2018–present), appearing on their 1971 LP and contributing songs to their catalogue. In 2018, Lofgren re-joined Crazy Horse and along with the band performed on Young&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Colorado&quot; and 2021&#x27;s &quot;Barn&quot;.

In 2023, Neil Young along with the members of Crazy Horse released the album &quot;All Roads Lead Home&quot; under the band name Molina, Talbot, Lofgren and Young.

===Solo career===
After Grin disbanded in 1974, Lofgren released his self-titled debut solo album which was a success with critics; a 1975 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review by Jon Landau labeled it one of the finest rock albums of the year, and &quot;NME&quot; ranked it fifth on its list of albums of the year. Subsequent albums did not always garner critical favor, although &quot;Cry Tough&quot; was voted number 10 in the 1976 NME Album round up; &quot;I Came to Dance&quot; in particular received a scathing review in the &quot;New Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot;. He achieved progressive rock radio hits in the mid-1970s with &quot;Back It Up&quot;, &quot;Keith Don&#x27;t Go&quot; and &quot;I Came to Dance&quot;. His song &quot;Bullets Fever&quot;, about the 1978 NBA champion Washington Bullets, would become a favorite in the Washington area. Throughout the 1970s, Lofgren released solo albums and toured extensively with a backing band that usually included brother Tom on rhythm guitar. Lofgren&#x27;s concerts displayed his reputation for theatrics, such as playing guitar while doing flips on a trampoline.

In 1971, he appeared on stage on the Roy Buchanan Special, PBS TV, with Bill Graham. In 1973, he appeared with Grin on NBC on &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, performing three songs live. In 1978, he wrote and sang the &quot;Nobody Bothers Me&quot; theme for a D.C. Jhoon Rhee Tae Kwon Do advertisement, and also appeared in the ill-received &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; movie. Lofgren appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, to promote his 1985 solo release &quot;Flip&quot;. Lofgren is credited on two of Lou Gramm&#x27;s (of Foreigner) solo albums: &quot;Ready or Not&quot; released in 1987 (Lofgren listed as lead guitarist) and &quot;Long Hard Look&quot; released in 1989 (Lofgren listed as one of the guitarists). In 1987, he contributed the television show theme arrangement for &quot;Hunter&quot;. In 1993 he contributed to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, with two Christmas jingles with Bart. In 1995, he appeared on a PBS tribute to the Beatles along with Dr. John. From 1991 to 1995, he was the CableAce Awards musical director and composer.

Lofgren continues to record and to tour as a solo act, with Patti Scialfa, with Neil Young, and as a two-time member of Ringo Starr&#x27;s All-Starr Band. Many of the people he worked with on those tours appeared on his 1991 album, &quot;Silver Lining&quot;. During the 2000s he got his own &quot;Nils Lofgren Day&quot; in Montgomery County, Maryland (August 25). In 2006 Lofgren released &quot;Sacred Weapon&quot;, featuring guest appearances by David Crosby, Graham Nash, Willie Nelson and Martin Sexton. In 2006 he recorded a live DVD &quot;Nils Lofgren &amp; Friends: Acoustic Live&quot; at the Legendary Birchmere Music Hall in Alexandria, Virginia.

On June 23, 2006, Lofgren performed at a benefit concert for Arthur Lee at New York&#x27;s Beacon Theatre, along with Robert Plant, Ian Hunter, Yo La Tengo and Garland Jeffreys. In 2007, he appeared playing guitar as part of Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27; backing band for Lewis&#x27; &quot;Last Man Standing Live&quot; concert DVD. He released &quot;The Loner – Nils Sings Neil&quot;, an album of acoustic covers of Neil Young songs, in 2008.

In September 2008, Lofgren had hip replacement surgery for both of his hips as a result of years of playing basketball, performing back flips on stage, and age.

In August 2014, a box set, &quot;Face the Music&quot;, was released on the Fantasy label. The career-spanning retrospective contains nine CDs and a DVD covering 45 years.

The creation of Lofgren&#x27;s 2015 live album &quot;UK 2015 Face the Music Tour&quot; was inspired by his wife Amy commenting that his recent live shows were the best she had seen him perform, as well as fans wanting to have a recording of the show they had just seen.

In December 2018, PBS NewsHour aired a 10-minute career retrospective &quot;Nils Lofgren: 50 years of &#x27;just being a guy in the band&quot;&#x27;.

Lofgren was a guest on a &quot;Private Lives&quot; one-hour radio special on East London Radio in the UK in October 2020. This series is shared across radio stations online and on FM/DAB, covering much of the UK.

===Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band===
In 1984, he joined Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s backing band, the E Street Band, as the replacement for Steven Van Zandt on guitar and vocals, in time for Springsteen&#x27;s Born in the U.S.A. Tour. Lofgren would appear on his first Springsteen album with 1987&#x27;s &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; and its Tunnel of Love Express and Human Rights Now! supporting tours. In 1989 Springsteen broke up the E Street Band and Lofgren returned to his solo work.

In 1995, the E Street Band, featuring both Lofgren and Van Zandt, recorded new songs for Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, though nothing else came from this reunion. In 1999, Springsteen, minus the E Street Band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The E Street Band would finally be inducted fifteen years later in 2014. Despite not being inducted in 1999 with Springsteen, the E Street Band (again with Lofgren and Van Zandt) performed with Springsteen for the first time since 1988 at the induction ceremony. This led to a successful Reunion Tour from 1999 to 2000 and a lineup featuring both Lofgren and Van Zandt as full-time members. The reunion tour resulted in 2002&#x27;s album, &quot;The Rising&quot;, the first album featuring the E Street Band since 1988, and another tour in 2002 and 2003. Springsteen then worked on other projects and toured without the E Street Band&#x27;s involvement until 2007&#x27;s &quot;Magic&quot; album and tour of 2007/2008. This tour was followed by 2009&#x27;s &quot;Working on a Dream&quot; album and tour. In 2012, Springsteen released &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;, which featured some of the E Street Band members; Lofgren did not appear, though he did perform with the band on the album&#x27;s supporting tour. 2014 saw the release of the album &quot;High Hopes&quot; along with another tour. In 2016, Springsteen celebrated the 35th anniversary of his album &quot;The River&quot;, with a tour in support of &quot;The Ties That Bind: The River Collection&quot; box set. In 2020, Springsteen released his album &quot;Letter to You&quot;, which featured the E Street Band; a supporting tour was delayed until 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lofgren tested positive for COVID-19, forcing him to miss one show on the tour in February 2023. It was the first show Lofgren had missed since joining the band in 1984.

===Other work===
The late novelist Clive Cussler lived close to Lofgren&#x27;s Arizona home, and collaborated on a song with him titled &quot;What Ever Happened to Muscatel?&quot;

On August 17, 2017, Lofgren was inducted into the Arizona Music &amp; Entertainment Hall of Fame.

In May 2018, Lofgren replaced Frank Sampedro in Crazy Horse for their reunion concerts with Neil Young.

On January 29, 2022, Lofgren pulled his music from Spotify, after Neil Young and Joni Mitchell had done the same. This was in response to their belief that COVID-19 misinformation was spread by the streaming service&#x27;s &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;.

<text>Quark Software Inc. (founded 1981 in Denver, Colorado) is a privately owned software company which specializes in enterprise publishing software for automating the production of customer communications. The company&#x27;s original goal was to &quot;create software that would be the platform for publishing&quot;, just as quarks are the basis for all matter.

The company is best known for its desktop page layout and design software, QuarkXPress, although this has now become secondary to its other products and services.

==History==
Quark was founded with $2,000 in 1981 in Denver, Colorado, U.S. Between 1981 and 1985, their primary products were Word Juggler and Catalyst. Word Juggler was the first word processor on the Apple III. Catalyst was a program that was distributed bundled with the Apple IIe, and allowed users to run floppy disk–based applications from their hard drive. They also attempted a product line called &quot;Quark Peripherals&quot;, but the market for storage devices at the time resulted in a huge financial loss. The devices released, the &quot;QC10&quot; and &quot;QC20&quot;, were 10 and 20MB hard disk drives, respectively, that could be used with the Apple IIe or IIc, the Apple /// or III+, or the Macintosh (notably, via the Macintosh&#x27;s floppy disk drive port). The QC10 retailed for US$1,295.00 in October 1985.

In March 1987, Quark released QuarkXPress 1.0, which due to its precision quickly gained market share from Aldus PageMaker. With the release of QuarkXPress 3.0 in 1990, Quark quickly achieved a dominant position in the desktop publishing market and became the standard for desktop publishing. By the end of the 1990s, it had gathered a market share of around 90%.

In the late 1990s, Quark faced intense criticism for slow innovation cycles, high prices, and a poor response to customer needs. Therefore, many customers welcomed the release of Adobe InDesign in 1999 as a viable alternative. The release of Adobe Creative Suite in 2003, essentially including InDesign with Photoshop and Illustrator, resulted in ongoing market share loss for QuarkXPress.

As a result, under the new leadership of Raymond Schiavone, Quark started to refocus its resources towards the enterprise dynamic publishing market (now Content Automation), announcing a new strategy in March 2008.

Quark acquired A Lowly Apprentice Productions (ALAP), which provides extended technology for the publishing and graphic design industries, in 2005.

In 2008, Quark Software acquired an XML editor vendor In.vision Research Corporation. It also acquired Gluon in 2010, a New Jersey–based software company that develops tools for the corporate and publishing industries.

On May 29, 2012, Quark acquired Mobile IQ, with digital publishing technology for tablet devices named PressRun, later renamed to App Studio.

In 2017, Quark acquired Docurated, a New York–based creator of sales and marketing software. for an undisclosed amount. Docurated’s CEO and founder Alex Gorbansky joined Quark’s executive team.

In 2022 the company opened new offices in Birmingham, UK, and Dublin, Ireland.

Quark was listed in 2023 UK’s Best Workplaces in Tech list and won Bronze Stevie Award in the Content Management Solution category in the 21st Annual American Business Awards.

===Ownership and management===
Quark was founded under the name &quot;Quark Engineering&quot; in 1981 by Tim Gill and Mark Pope. In 1986, Fred Ebrahimi joined Quark as CEO and co-owner. In 1990, Mark Pope sold his share of the company to the other partners. In 2000, Tim Gill left Quark and sold all his shares to Ebrahimi.

In keeping with its India focus, Quark appointed Kamar Aulakh, a Quark veteran of Indian origin, as its CEO in February 2004. In June 2005, Quark informed its employees that Aulakh was no longer with the company.

At the end of 2006, Fred Ebrahimi gave all his shares of Quark Inc. to his children, with his daughter Sasha Ebrahimi taking the position of chairman.

On November 1, 2006, Quark appointed Raymond Schiavone, former CEO of Arbortext, as its new CEO.

On August 9, 2011, the Ebrahimi family sold all their shares to Platinum Equity, a California-based private equity firm.

Parallax Capital Partners subsequently acquired Quark Software Inc. from Platinum Equity on July 12, 2017, stating their intentions to invest in growing the company&#x27;s new content automation business through organic growth and acquisitions.

On June 1, 2021, Quark appointed Martin Owen, former SVP of Products at Erwin (now Quest Software), as its new CEO.

==Products==
Quark&#x27;s first products were word processing software for the Apple II and Apple III. In 1987, it released its best known product, QuarkXPress, for Apple Macintosh. In 1992, it also released the product for Microsoft Windows.

In the 1990s, QuarkXPress 3.x gained around 90% market share of page layout applications. Its editorial workflow system, called Quark Publishing System, sold almost a thousand times to magazines and newspapers.

The company announced a picture editing application, QuarkXPosure, which was never released, and a multimedia authoring add-on XTension for QuarkXPress, QuarkImmedia. Neither is part of Quark&#x27;s portfolio anymore. The company briefly purchased and marketed a standalone multimedia authoring program, mTropolis, before discontinuing it in the late 1990s.

Quark acquired two companies creating add-ons for QuarkXPress and InDesign, ALAP in 2005 and Gluon in 2010.

<text>DePauw University ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Greencastle, Indiana, United States. It was founded in 1837 as Indiana Asbury College and changed its name to DePauw University in 1884. The college has a Methodist heritage and was founded to be an ecumenical institution of national stature, &quot;conducted on the most liberal principles, accessible to all religious denominations and designed for the benefit of our citizens in general&quot;.

In 2023, DePauw had an enrollment of about 1,800 students. Its residential campus is located west of Indianapolis and is spread across 175 acres and 36 buildings, with an additional 520-acre DePauw Nature Park.

==History==
Indiana Asbury University was founded in 1837 in Greencastle, Indiana, and was named after Francis Asbury, the first American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The people of Greencastle raised $25,000 to entice the Methodists to establish the college in Greencastle, which was little more than a village at the time. It was originally established as an all-men&#x27;s school but began admitting women in 1867.

In 1884 Indiana Asbury University changed its name to DePauw University in honor of Washington C. DePauw, who made a sequence of substantial donations throughout the 1870s, which culminated in his largest single donation that established the School of Music during 1884. Before his death in 1887, DePauw donated over $600,000 to Indiana Asbury, equal to around $17 million in 2021. In 2002, the school received the largest-ever gift to a liberal arts college, $128 million by the Holton family. Subsequently, in 2024, DePauw received a $200 million gift that combined a $150 million anonymous donation with an additional $50 million in matching funds from other donors.

Sigma Delta Chi, known today as the Society of Professional Journalists, was founded at the college in 1909 by a group of student journalists, including Eugene C. Pulliam. The world&#x27;s first Greek-letter sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta, was also founded at DePauw in 1870. DePauw is home to the two longest continually running fraternity chapters in the world: the Delta chapter of Beta Theta Pi and the Lambda chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.

During World War II, DePauw University was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

As of July 2020, Lori White, previously vice chancellor for student affairs at Washington University in St. Louis, is the 21st president of DePauw University. White is the first woman and African American to serve as President of DePauw University.

==Campus==
DePauw University is located approximately west of Indianapolis. Its campus consists of 36 major buildings spread out over a campus that includes a nature park, and There are 11 residence halls, 4 theme houses, and 31 college-owned houses and apartments spread throughout the campus. The oldest building on campus, East College, was built in 1877 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. DePauw also owns McKim Observatory.

Centrally located The cornerstone for the building was laid on October 20, 1871. The building hosted commencement exercises in June 1874, and in September 1875 all college classes were moved to the building, according to the book, &quot;DePauw Through the Years&quot;. But work on East College continued until 1882 when the building&#x27;s basement was completed. East College was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

DePauw has two libraries: Roy O. West Library (main library) and the Music Library (located in the Green Center for Performing Arts). Library holdings include approximately 350,000 books; 22,000 videos; 1,000 print periodical titles; access to over 20,000 electronic titles; 450,000 government documents; newspapers; and online databases.

==Academics==
DePauw&#x27;s liberal arts education gives students a chance to gain general knowledge beyond their direct area of study by taking classes outside their degrees and engaging in Winter Term classes and trips. Its most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were econometrics and quantitative economics (83), speech communication and rhetoric (63), computer science (35), biochemistry (31), and psychology (27).

DePauw University&#x27;s schedule is divided into a 4–1–4-1 calendar: besides the 15-week Autumn and Spring Semesters, there is also a 4-week Winter Term as well as a May Term. Students take one course during these terms, which are either used as a period for students to explore a subject of interest on campus or participate in off-campus domestic or international internship programs, service trips, or international trips and field studies. One survey of DePauw students found that over 80% of DePauw graduates studied abroad.

DePauw University has a student-faculty ratio of 9:1 and has no classes with more than 35 students.

===Admissions===
DePauw&#x27;s admissions are considered &quot;more selective&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. As of 2023, the average newly enrolled student had a 3.97 GPA, an SAT score between 1160 and 1420, and an ACT score between 24 and 31. Besides standardized test scores, the university considers an applicant&#x27;s GPA very important, high school class rank when available, and letters of recommendation important.

===Reputation and rankings===
In 2025, DePauw was ranked tied for 50th among liberal arts colleges in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. DePauw is ranked #170 on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2024 rankings, which include all colleges and universities in the United States.

===Institutes and programs===
Since 2007, the Prindle Institute has served as a place for reflection, discussion, and education. Prindle sponsors events related to ethics and provides opportunities for students, faculty, and staff to engage in discussions. The institute also publishes ethics related content through &quot;The Prindle Post&quot; and the &quot;Examining Ethics&quot; podcast.

DePauw University has one of the oldest private institutions for post-secondary music instruction in the country. Founded in 1884, the school has about 100 students. The student-to-teacher ratio is 5:1 with an average class size of 13 students. The Institute of Music is housed inside the Green Center for Performing Arts (GCPA), constructed in 2007, which integrated and replaced parts of the former structure. The Institute of Music grants Bachelor of Arts as well as Bachelor of Musical Arts degrees. The latter allows students to add an emphasis on the music business. Effective 2024, School of Music was renamed the &quot;Institute of Music&quot; under the newly launched &quot;Creative School&quot;. The name change does not impact accreditation.

Since 1919, the Rector Scholar Program has recognized DePauw students of exceptional scholarship and character. To be named a Rector Scholar is to join a prestigious tradition of more than 4,000 graduates strong. Rector Scholarships are offered to the top academic applicants offered admission to DePauw. A limited number of full-tuition Presidential Rector Scholarships are available.

===Society of Professional Journalists===
On May 6, 1909, Sigma Delta Chi was founded by a group of DePauw University student journalists. The organization officially changed its name to the Society of Professional Journalists in 1988. Today it is the nation&#x27;s most broad-based journalism organization, encouraging the free practice of journalism and stimulating high standards of ethical behavior. SPJ promotes the free flow of information vital to a well-informed citizenry; works to inspire and educate the next generation of journalists; and protects First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech and press. In 2012, SPJ returned to the DePauw campus with the assistance of Eugene S. Pulliam Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism Mark Tatge &quot;

Many students engage in community service and other volunteer activities. Putnam County Relay For Life is organized by students and brings together the college and community.

The Boulder Run has become a tradition at DePauw University. Students, streaking from their respective residences, run to and from the Columbia Boulder, located in the center of the campus near the East College building. Another campus tradition, campus golf, requires a golf club and a tennis ball. Players attempt to hit their tennis ball against various targets on campus within a number of strokes.

===Greek life===

DePauw&#x27;s Greek system began just eight years after the founding of Indiana Asbury College in 1837. Several chapters were founded in the 19th century. Women were first admitted to Indiana Asbury in 1867, and the first Greek-letter fraternity for women soon followed. Just under 70% of students at DePauw are affiliated with a Greek-letter organization. The Greek community consists of more than a dozen national social fraternities and approximately ten sororities. Some Greek-letter organizations were founded at DePauw.

In 2006, the Delta Zeta sorority chapter at DePauw University became embroiled in controversy for deactivating certain members based on their perceived attractiveness. The controversy made national headlines, resulting in the chapter&#x27;s closing and various legal actions.

===Media===
The Pulliam Center for Contemporary Media houses the school&#x27;s media facilities. This includes a student-run television station, radio station WGRE, newspaper, and two magazines. First published in 1852 as &quot;Asbury Notes&quot;, The DePauw is Indiana&#x27;s oldest college newspaper. When school is in session, the Pulliam Center is open to students and faculty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

===Music===
The DePauw University Institute of Music presents regular recitals by students and faculty and concerts by visiting artists, most of which are free and open to the public.

DePauw students also organize concerts for the campus community. Performers in recent years have included Dave Matthews, Train, The Black Eyed Peas, Ben Folds, Rufus Wainwright, and Guster. Past guests have included Billy Joel, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, The Carpenters, America, Yo-Yo Ma, and Harry Chapin.

==Athletics==

The DePauw Tigers compete in the NCAA Division III North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). Every year since 1890, DePauw University has competed in American football against its rival Wabash College in what has become the Monon Bell Classic. The traveling trophy, a 300-pound train bell from the Monon Railroad, made its debut in the rivalry in 1932. The DePauw-Wabash series is one of the nation&#x27;s oldest college football rivalries.

In 1933, head coach Ray &quot;Gaumey&quot; Neal led the DePauw Tigers football team to an unbeaten, untied, and unscored opening season. The Tigers compiled a 7–0–0 record and outscored their opponents 136–0. Neal nearly duplicated this feat in 1943, but DePauw, 5–0–1, finished the season with one scoreless tie and six points allowed in a different game. The only points surrendered that season was in a 39–6 victory over Indiana State and the only non-win was a 0–0 tie against Oberlin. The Tigers outscored their opponents, 206–6.

DePauw had been a member of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference from 1997 to 2011 and won numerous conference championships, most notably in women&#x27;s basketball, where the school is a Division III power. DePauw&#x27;s program had also won the conference&#x27;s overall &quot;President&#x27;s Trophy&quot; seven times in that span, including six consecutive President&#x27;s Trophies from 2005 to 2006 to 2010–11. In 2007, the Tigers defeated Washington University in St. Louis to win the Division III title in women&#x27;s basketball. The women&#x27;s softball team won the regional title, advancing to the Division III College World Series for the first time in school history. Most notably in 2021, the DePauw softball team finished third at the NCAA Division III Softball Championship.

===Monon Bell Classic===
Voted &quot;Indiana&#x27;s Best College Sports Rivalry&quot; by viewers of ESPN in 2005, DePauw University and Wabash College play each November—in the last regular season football game of the year for both teams—for the right to keep or reclaim the Monon Bell. The two teams first met in 1890. The game routinely sells out (up to 11,000 seats, depending upon the venue.

<doc id="176420" wikidata="Q536384" url="?curid=176420" title="Underwood Dudley">
<text>Underwood Dudley (born January 6, 1937) is an American mathematician and writer. His popular works include several books describing crank mathematics by pseudomathematicians who incorrectly believe they have squared the circle or done other impossible things.

==Career==
Dudley was born in New York City. He received bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from the Carnegie Institute of Technology and a PhD from the University of Michigan. His academic career consisted of two years at Ohio State University followed by 37 years at DePauw University, from which he retired in 2004. He edited the &quot;College Mathematics Journal&quot; and the &quot;Pi Mu Epsilon Journal&quot;, and was a Pólya Lecturer for the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) for two years. He is the discoverer of the Dudley triangle.

==Publications==
Dudley&#x27;s popular books include &quot;Mathematical Cranks&quot; (MAA 1992, ), &quot;The Trisectors&quot; (MAA 1996, ), and &quot;Numerology: Or, What Pythagoras Wrought&quot; (MAA 1997, ). Dudley won the Trevor Evans Award for expository writing from the MAA in 1996.

Dudley has also written and edited straightforward mathematical works such as &quot;Readings for Calculus&quot; (MAA 1993, ) and &quot;Elementary Number Theory&quot; (W.H. Freeman 1978, ). In 2009, he authored &quot;A Guide to Elementary Number Theory&quot; (MAA, 2009, ), published under Mathematical Association of America&#x27;s Dolciani Mathematical Expositions.

== Lawsuit ==
In 1995, Dudley was one of several people sued by William Dilworth for defamation because &quot;Mathematical Cranks&quot; included an analysis of Dilworth&#x27;s &quot;A correction in set theory&quot;, an attempted refutation of Cantor&#x27;s diagonal method. The suit was dismissed in 1996 due to failure to state a claim.

The dismissal was upheld on appeal in a decision written by judge Richard Posner. From the decision: &quot;A crank is a person inexplicably obsessed by an obviously unsound idea—a person with a bee in his bonnet. To call a person a crank is to say that because of some quirk of temperament he is wasting his time pursuing a line of thought that is plainly without merit or promise ... To call a person a crank is basically just a colorful and insulting way of expressing disagreement with his master idea, and it therefore belongs to the language of controversy rather than to the language of defamation.&quot;

<doc id="176422" wikidata="Q1971218" url="?curid=176422" title="Thomas Warton">
<text>Thomas Warton (9 January 172821 May 1790) was an English literary historian, critic, and poet. He was appointed Poet Laureate in 1785, following the death of William Whitehead. 

He is sometimes called &quot;Thomas Warton the younger&quot; to distinguish him from his father, who had the same name. His most famous poem is &quot;The Pleasures of Melancholy&quot;, a representative work of the Graveyard Poets.

==Life==

Warton was born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, the son of poet Thomas Warton, the Elder, and younger brother of Joseph Warton and Jane Warton. As a youngster, Warton demonstrated a strong predilection toward writing poetry, a skill he would continue to develop all of his life. In fact, Warton translated one of Martial&#x27;s epigrams at nine and wrote &quot;The Pleasures of Melancholy&quot; at seventeen.

His early education was given to him by his father at home. In March 1744, aged 16, he entered Trinity College, Oxford. He graduated from Oxford in 1747, where he subsequently became a Fellow. Warton was selected as Poet Laureate of Oxford in 1747 and again in 1748. His duty in this post was to write a poem about a selected patroness of the university, which would be read to her on a specially appointed day.
Warton was appointed Professor of Poetry at the university in 1757, a post that he held for ten years.

In 1771, he was appointed rector of Kiddington in Oxfordshire, a post he held until his death. In 1785, he was appointed Camden Professor of History, as well as the eighth Poet Laureate. 

Among other important contributions, Warton, along with his brother, was among the first to argue that &quot;Sir Thopas&quot;, by Geoffrey Chaucer, was a parody. Warton contributed to the general project of the ballad revival. He was a general supporter of the poetry of Thomas Gray—a fact that Johnson satirized in his parody &quot;Hermit hoar, in solemn cell.&quot; Among his minor works were an edition of Theocritus, a selection of Latin and Greek inscriptions, the humorous &quot;Oxford Companion to the Guide and Guide to the Companion&quot; (1762); lives of Sir Thomas Pope and Ralph Bathurst; and an &quot;Inquiry into the Authenticity of the Poems attributed to Thomas Rowley&quot; (1782).

Warton gave little attention to his clerical duties, and Oxford always remained his home. He was known as a very easy and convivial as well as a very learned don, with a taste for taverns and crowds as well as dim aisles and romances.

==Poetry, criticism and historical works==
In a poem written in 1745 he shows the delight in Gothic churches and ruined castles which inspired much of his subsequent work in romantic revival. Most of Warton&#x27;s poetry was written before the age of twenty-three, when he took his M.A. degree.
In 1749, he penned &quot;The Triumph of Isis&quot;, a poem in praise of Oxford and the many students who had received their education there. Published anonymously, &quot;The Triumph of Isis&quot; rebutted William Mason&#x27;s Isis, an Elegy published the previous year, which was anything but flattering to Oxford.

Following the success of &quot;The Triumph of Isis&quot;, Warton wrote &quot;Newmarket, a Satire&quot;, which was followed by a collection of verses. His complete poetical works were included in an anthology that was published in 1853.

Although he continued to write poetry, Warton&#x27;s main energies were turned to poetical reading and criticism. His first major academic work was &quot;Observations on the Faerie Queene of Spenser&quot;, published in 1754. He is, however, best known for the three-volume &quot;The History of English Poetry&quot; (1774–81), which covered the poetry of the 11th through the 16th centuries. Although the work was criticised for its many inaccuracies, it is nonetheless considered a highly important and influential historical tome.

In 1782, he wrote &quot;The History and Antiquities of Kiddington&quot;, an early example of English local history.

==Warton Lectures==
In 1910, Frida Mond endowed the British Academy with a fund to establish an annual Shakespeare oration or lecture, as well as an annual lecture on English poetry to be called the Warton Lecture, as a tribute to the memory of Thomas Warton as a historian of English poetry. The inaugural lectures in these series were delivered in 1911 and 1910, respectively.

<text>The national flag of Norway (; ; ) is red with a navy blue Scandinavian cross bordered in white that extends to the edges of the flag; the vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side in the style of the &quot;Dannebrog&quot;, the flag of Denmark.

== History ==



It is difficult to establish what the earliest flag of Norway looked like. During ancient times countries did not fly flags. Kings and other rulers flew flags, especially in battle. Saint Olav used a serpent within a white mark at the Battle of Nesjar. Prior to this the raven or dragon was used. Magnus the Good used the same mark as Saint Olav. Harald Hardrade used the raven banner. This flag was flown by various Viking chieftains and other Scandinavian rulers during the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries AD. Inge used a red lion on gold. Sverre used an eagle in gold and red. The earliest known flag which could be described as a national flag of Norway is the one used today as the Royal Standard. Eirik Magnusson used a flag described as a golden lion with axe and crown on red from 1280 and this was since regularly the flag of the king of Norway and thereby also of Norway.

The flag is based on the coat of arms and was originally only a flag for the ruler of Norway (as it is today). It was later also used on ships and on fortresses until it was gradually phased out during the 17th and 18th centuries. Its earliest certain depiction is on the seal of duchess Ingebjørg in 1318. Around 1500 it became the custom for ships to fly the flag of their home country to identify their nationality. A red flag with the golden lion and silver halberd is depicted as the flag of Norway in a Dutch flag book from 1669 to 1670. At least as late as 1698 the lion banner was flown over Akershus Fortress. The &quot;Norwegian lion&quot; was placed in the colours of all the Norwegian regiments in 1641. In 1748 a decree stated that the Dannebrog should be the only legal merchant flag.

From about the 16th century until 1814, Norway used the same flag as Denmark, as it was in union with that country. In 1814 independent Norway adopted the Danish flag with the Norwegian lion in the canton or the upper square at the hoist. This flag was in use as state and war flag until 1815 and as merchant flag until 1821. Later in 1814 Norway was united with Sweden, and on 7 March 1815 a common war flag for both states was introduced by royal order in council, the Swedish flag with a white cross on a red background in the square canton. The same design in a rectangular flag was introduced as an alternate merchant flag in 1818, for use in distant waters, i.e. south of Cape Finisterre in Spain.

The current flag of Norway was designed in 1821 by Fredrik Meltzer, a member of the parliament (Storting). It was adopted by both chambers of the Storting on 11 and 16 May, respectively. However, the king refused to sign the flag law, but approved the design for civilian use by royal order in council on 13 July 1821. The constitution of 1814 explicitly stated that the war flag was to be a union flag, hence the common flag (Swedish with a canton signifying Norway) was used by the armies and navies of both states until 1844.

Until 1838 the Norwegian flag was only used in Northern waters, i.e. the waters north of Cape Finisterre, as Norway had no treaty with the Barbary pirates of North Africa and had to fly the Swedish or union flag for protection. In 1844 a union mark combining Norwegian and Swedish colours was placed at the hoist of both countries&#x27; flags. The badge was jokingly or derogatorily called &quot;Sildesalaten&quot; (&quot;the herring salad&quot;) because of its jumble of colours and resemblance to a popular dish on the breakfast tables of both countries. Initially, the union flag was popular in Norway, since it clearly denoted the equal status of the two . As the union with Sweden became less popular, the Norwegian parliament abolished the union mark from the national (merchant) and state flags in 1898. Although the law was not approved by the King, it became effective since it had been passed by three consecutive Stortings. The &quot;pure&quot; flag was first flown in 1899, but the union mark had to be kept in the war flag. After the dissolution of the union, it was removed from the navy flag as well on 9 June 1905. Sweden kept it in all flags until 1 November 1905.

== Laws regarding the flag ==
The Norwegian flag law of 1898 specifies the appearance of the merchant and state flags and their use by merchant ships, customs and post vessels. The flag regulations of 1927 further describe the use of the state flag on state property and on national holidays.

The flag regulations also describe the time of day when the flag should be hoisted and lowered. From March to October the flag should be hoisted from 08.00. From November to February it should be hoisted from 09.00. The flag is lowered at sunset, although no later than 21.00, even if sunset is later than that. In the northern counties of Nordland and Troms the flag is flown between 10.00 and 15.00 from November to February. These rules do not apply for private use of the flag, but they are generally observed by all citizens.

There also exist written rules for the proper folding of the flag, for not letting it touch the ground, and in addition the unwritten rule that it should not be worn on the body below the waist.

Since 1933, only the Norwegian, the Sámi or the local official flags were allowed to fly on top of municipality buildings. Since 2014, the municipalities could hoist a different flag if an event in the building was related to it. In 2021, related to the group gathering restrictions with COVID-19, the government proposed to adapt the legislation so that municipalities do not need to host an event for hoisting a flag.

== Construction sheets ==
The proportions of the national flag are 16:22 (height (width) to length), its colour elements having widths of 6:1:2:1:6 and lengths of 6:1:2:1:12.
The proportions of the state flag are 16:27, or 6:1:2:1:6 vertically and 6:1:2:1:6:11 horizontally.

The law regarding the Norwegian flag by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs defines the colours as deep red and dark blue (“høirødt” og “mørkeblåt”) and white, with no reference to a specific colour system.

Flag producers normally use the red colour 200 and blue colour 281 from the Pantone colour matching system (note that no suffixes are specified in these PMS values, since the coated C version is normally assumed). These colours for the Norwegian flag were also defined on page 79 of the publication &quot;Flags and anthems manual, London 2012&quot;, and were used for the summer Olympic games in London 2012. Oslo Orlogsforening also specifies Pantone 200 and 281. The flag manufacturer Langkilde &amp; Søn even refers to Pantone 200 as «Norwegian Red» and Pantone 281 as «Norwegian Blue». As of 2021, the Nordic Council also specifies Pantone 200 and 281.

Other sources have specified different colours for the red and the blue in relation to the Pantone colour matching system (PMS). In a document on the Norwegian government&#x27;s web pages, the red colour is defined as “Pantone 032 U” and the blue as “Pantone 281 U”. However, Norwegian flag producers consider this red colour to be incorrect, and have complained that the Norwegian state propagates what they perceive as misinformation. For example, it has been argued that pantone suffixes (such as C and U) only are relevant for print on paper, and thus should not be used to specify flag colours. Norwegian authorities have since clarified that the colours only were an internal recommendation intended specifically for silkscreen printing, and not a legal definition, and has since withdrawn the recommendation. The Nordic Flag Society currently defines the red colour as PMS 186 and the blue as PMS 287. The Nordic Council previously attributed their colours to this source but defined red colour as “Pantone 186 C” (note the C postfix) while the blue was identical to the source (“Pantone 287”). However, in 2010 the same website defined the blue colour as “Pantone 301”.
On 25 April 2018 the Norwegian foreign minister recommended that Norwegian flag manufacturers take initiative to form a technical standard describing a guidance on which colours to use in the flag of Norway, similar to what has been done in Denmark. It was stressed that it is the colour of the finished product that matters, and that this may result in the guide describing different colour codes for fabric, paper and web use.

Due to the vastly different ways colors are reproduced on physical flags versus on digital displays (using web colors), there is naturally no precise RGB equivalent to the Pantone colours. However, a good approximation can be achieved by following the official translation to web colors in the Pantone Formula Guide. With the de facto standard used by Norwegian flag producers being PMS 200 and 281, the corresponding web colors using the official Pantone Matching System is for PMS 200 (deep red) and for PMS 281 (dark blue).

== Traditions regarding the flag ==
===Music when raising (hoisting) or lowering the flag===
When raising the Norwegian flag on festive or ceremonial occasions, the hoisting will often be accompanied by a bugle call, fanfare, or the national anthem (Ja, vi elsker). For civilian use on ceremonial occasions, there are no written rules concerning this. The Norwegian armed forces have a unified bugle call for hoisting and lowering the flag, known as &quot;flaggappell&quot; (&quot;Attention to the flag&quot;) &quot;(cf. Bugle calls of the Norwegian Army).&quot;

===Code of conduct during flag hoisting and lowering===
According to Norwegian law as well as common usage, flags of other sovereign states are to be treated with the same respect as the Norwegian flag.

For civilians and non-uniformed government employees, there are no formal hand gestures (e.g. the U.S. &quot;hand-over-the-heart&quot; gesture {cf. United States Flag Code) that must be performed.
But it is commonly agreed that during the hoisting or lowering of the flag, civilians should conduct themselves in a respectful manner by facing the flag and standing still, straight, and quiet. Males should be bareheaded (unless there are religious, medical, or climatic reasons for covering the head).

All uniformed government personnel (e.g.: municipal traffic wardens, policemen, customs official, prison wardens, maritime pilots, armed forces personnel) follow the Norwegian Armed Forces regulation during flag hoisting or lowering. The regulations stipulate that when seeing the flag being hoisted or lowered, or hearing the bugle call, all activity should if possible be stopped, and personnel should execute the foot drill manoeuvre of &quot;Halt and front face&quot; (stopping up and turning one&#x27;s body to face the flagpole).

A person must render a salute to the flag when wearing a uniform hat, cap or beret while not in formation. A person in formation or not wearing a prescribed uniform hat, should stand at attention for the duration of the bugle signal, or if in sight of the hoisting or lowering, until the flag is either at the top of the pole, at half mast, or until two thirds of the flag is in the hands of the flag party.

===Rolling up the flag===
Unlike the Anglo-American traditions of folding a flag (the triangular shape of the U.S. flag or the square shape of the UK&#x27;s Union Flag), the Norwegian tradition is to &quot;roll the flag&quot; into a cylindrical shape and tie it up after lowering it.

The first step of this procedure is to fold the flag lengthwise so that its two long sides meet. Each half will then be folded 180 degrees, concealing the longitudinal white and blue stripes. Finally the folded full length flag, its width of the hoist, will be rolled up into a red cylinder.

If the flag is fitted with a line, this is wrapped around the flag and tied with a simple slip knot. The use of a simple slip knot allows one person alone to hoist the flag unaided.

===Occupation flag===
When on international missions, Norwegian armed forces may keep a flag (national or merchant flag) raised during the night and illuminated by a spotlight, to affirm their presence and to boost morale.

This tradition stems from World War II, when a small-sized flag was hoisted (usually above the CO quarters) in the numerous camps of Norwegian forces in the UK, USA, Sweden, and Canada, to symbolize that fight against the enemy would go on day and night until final victory.

===Dishonoured flag===
Military regulations stipulate that a Norwegian flag shall never touch the ground, since this is disrespectful towards the flag and may signify surrender.

== Symbolism ==
Fredrik Meltzer submitted his proposal just in time to be exhibited in parliament on 4 May 1821 together with a large number of other proposals. It was approved by both chambers during the following two weeks. Meltzer himself provided no written explanation for his choice of design and colours. However, his intentions may be inferred from an earlier letter of 30 April with his comments regarding the proposal from the flag committee. That design was divided quarterly red and white. Meltzer objected to the colours because they were too similar to those of the Danish flag. He added that it would be equally unseemly to choose the colours of any of &quot;those states with which we have been or are connected with&quot;. Instead, he recommended a tricolour of red, white and blue, &quot;three colours that now denote freedom, such as we have seen in the French flag of freedom, and still see in that of the Dutch and Americans, and in the Union of the Englishmen&quot;.

His eventual choice a few days later of a Nordic cross was clearly based on the tradition established by the other Nordic countries, Denmark and Sweden. This cross represents Christianity. The red and blue colours also explicitly referred to the same two countries, former and present union partners. It was clearly understood by all who took part in the flag discussions locally, in the press or in parliament what those colours denoted. A predominantly red flag had many adherents among those who were attached to the union with Denmark or to its flag, which for centuries had also been that of Norway. Others, who saw Denmark as an oppressor, favoured the blue colour associated with the new Swedish dynasty which was seen as more receptive of Norwegian ambitions of autonomy. Consequently, most of the other flag proposals on the agenda had either red or blue as the predominant colour, depending on the political preferences of the proposers.

<doc id="176424" wikidata="Q1334701" url="?curid=176424" title="Galvanic anode">
<text>A galvanic anode, or sacrificial anode, is the main component of a galvanic cathodic protection system used to protect buried or submerged metal structures from corrosion.

They are made from a metal alloy with a more &quot;active&quot; voltage (more negative reduction potential / more positive oxidation potential) than the metal of the structure. The difference in potential between the two metals means that the galvanic anode corrodes, in effect being &quot;sacrificed&quot; in order to protect the structure.

==Theory==
In brief, corrosion is a chemical reaction occurring by an electrochemical mechanism (a redox reaction). During corrosion of iron or steel there are two reactions, oxidation (equation ), where electrons leave the metal (and the metal dissolves, i.e. actual loss of metal results) and reduction, where the electrons are used to convert oxygen and water to hydroxide ions (equation ):
In most environments, the hydroxide ions and ferrous ions combine to form ferrous hydroxide, which eventually becomes the familiar brown rust:

As corrosion takes place, oxidation and reduction reactions occur and electrochemical cells are formed on the surface of the metal so that some areas will become anodic (oxidation) and some cathodic (reduction). Electrons flow from the anodic areas into the electrolyte as the metal corrodes. Conversely, as electrons flow from the electrolyte to the cathodic areas, the rate of corrosion is reduced. (The flow of electrons is in the opposite direction of the flow of electric current.)

As the metal continues to corrode, the local potentials on the surface of the metal will change and the anodic and cathodic areas will change and move. As a result, in ferrous metals, a general covering of rust is formed over the whole surface, which will eventually consume all the metal. This is rather a simplified view of the corrosion process, because it can occur in several different forms.

Prevention of corrosion by cathodic protection (CP) works by introducing another metal (the galvanic anode) with a much more anodic surface, so that all the current will flow from the introduced anode and the metal to be protected becomes cathodic in comparison to the anode. This effectively stops the oxidation reactions on the metal surface by transferring them to the galvanic anode, which will be sacrificed in favour of the structure under protection. More simply put, this takes advantage of the relatively low stability of magnesium, aluminum or zinc metals; they dissolve instead of iron because their bonding is weaker compared to iron, which is bonded strongly via its partially filled d-orbitals.

For this protection to work there must be an electron pathway between the anode and the metal to be protected (e.g., a wire or direct contact) and an ion pathway between both the oxidizing agent (e.g., oxygen and water or moist soil) and the anode, and the oxidizing agent and the metal to be protected, thus forming a closed circuit; therefore simply bolting a piece of active metal such as zinc to a less active metal, such as mild steel, in air (a poor ionic conductor) will not furnish any protection.

==Anode materials==

There are three main metals used as galvanic anodes: magnesium, aluminum and zinc. They are all available as blocks, rods, plates or extruded ribbon. Each material has advantages and disadvantages.

Magnesium has the most negative electropotential of the three (see galvanic series) and is more suitable for areas where the electrolyte (soil or water) resistivity is higher. This is usually on-shore pipelines and other buried structures, although it is also used on boats in fresh water and in water heaters. In some cases, the negative potential of magnesium can be a disadvantage: if the potential of the protected metal becomes too negative, reduction of water or solvated protons may evolve hydrogen atoms on the cathode surface, for instance according to

leading to hydrogen embrittlement or to disbonding of the coating. Where this is a concern, zinc anodes may be used. An aluminum-zinc-tin alloy called KA90 is commonly used in marine and water heater applications.

Zinc and aluminium are generally used in salt water, where the resistivity is generally lower and magnesium dissolves relatively quickly by reaction with water under hydrogen evolution (self-corrosion). Typical uses are for the hulls of ships and boats, offshore pipelines and production platforms, in salt-water-cooled marine engines, on small boat propellers and rudders, and for the internal surface of storage tanks. 

Zinc is considered a reliable material, but is not suitable for use at higher temperatures, as it tends to passivate (the oxide layer formed shields from further oxidation); if this happens, current may cease to flow and the anode stops working. Zinc has a relatively low driving voltage, which means in higher-resistivity soils or water it may not be able to provide sufficient current. However, in some circumstances — where there is a risk of hydrogen embrittlement, for example — this lower voltage is advantageous, as overprotection is avoided.

Aluminium anodes have several advantages, such as a lighter weight, and much higher capacity than zinc. However, their electrochemical behavior is not considered as reliable as zinc, and greater care must be taken in how they are used. Aluminium anodes will passivate where chloride concentration is below 1,446 parts per million.

One disadvantage of aluminium is that if it strikes a rusty surface, a large thermite spark may be generated, so its use is restricted in tanks where there may be explosive atmospheres and there is a risk of the anode falling.

Since the operation of a galvanic anode relies on the difference in electropotential between the anode and the cathode, practically any metal can be used to protect some other, providing there is a sufficient difference in potential. For example, iron anodes can be used to protect copper.

==Design considerations==

The design of a galvanic anode CP system should consider many factors, including the type of structure, the resistivity of the electrolyte (soil or water) it will operate in, the type of coating and the service life.

The primary calculation is how much anode material will be required to protect the structure for the required time. Too little material may provide protection for a while, but need to be replaced regularly. Too much material would provide protection at an unnecessary cost. The mass in kg is given by equation ().

* The design life is in years (1 year = 8760 hours).
* The utilisation factor (UF) of the anode is a constant value, depending on the shape of the anode and how it is attached, which signifies how much of the anode can be consumed before it ceases to be effective. A value of 0.8 indicates that 80% of the anode can be consumed, before it should be replaced. A long slender stand off anode (installed on legs to keep the anode away from the structure) has a UF value of 0.9, whereas the UF of a short, flush mounted anode is 0.8.
* Anode capacity is an indication of how much material is consumed as current flows over time. The value for zinc in seawater is 780 Ah/kg but aluminium is 2000 Ah/kg, which reflects the lower atomic mass of aluminium and means that, in theory, aluminium can produce much more current per weight than zinc before being depleted and this is one of the factors to consider when choosing a particular material.

The amount of current required corresponds directly to the surface area of the metal exposed to the soil or water, so the application of a coating drastically reduces the mass of anode material required. The better the coating, the less anode material is needed.

Once the required mass of material is known, the particular type of anode is chosen. Differently shaped anodes will have a different resistance to earth, which governs how much current can be produced, so the resistance of the anode is calculated to ensure that sufficient current will be available. If the resistance of the anode is too high, either a differently shaped or sized anode is chosen, or a greater quantity of anodes must be used.

The arrangement of the anodes is then planned so as to provide an even distribution of current over the whole structure. For example, if a particular design shows that a pipeline long needs 10 anodes, then approximately one anode per kilometre would be more effective than putting all 10 anodes at one end or in the centre.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

===Advantages===
* No external power sources required.
* Relatively easy to install.
* Lower voltages and current mean that risk of causing stray current interference on other structures is low.
* Require less frequent monitoring than impressed current CP systems.
* Relatively low risk of overprotection.
* Once installed, testing the system components is relatively simple for trained personnel.

===Disadvantages===
* Current capacity limited by anode mass and self consumption at low current density.
* Lower driving voltage means the anodes may not work in high-resistivity environments.
* Often requires that the protected structure be electrically isolated from other structures and ground.
* Anodes are heavy and will increase water resistance on moving structures or pipe interiors.
* Where D.C. power is available, electrical energy can be obtained more cheaply than by galvanic anodes.
* Where large arrays are used, wiring is needed due to high current flow and need to keep resistance losses low.
* Anodes must be carefully placed to avoid interfering with water flow into the propeller.
* To retain effectiveness, the anodes must be inspected and/or replaced as part of normal maintenance.

==Cost effectiveness==

As the anode materials used are generally more costly than iron, using this method to protect ferrous metal structures may not appear to be particularly cost effective. However, consideration should also be given to the costs incurred to repair a corroded hull or to replace a steel pipeline or tank because their structural integrity has been compromised by corrosion.

However, there is a limit to the cost effectiveness of a galvanic system. On larger structures, such as long pipelines, so many anodes may be needed that it would be more cost-effective to install impressed current cathodic protection.

==Production of sacrificial anodes==
The basic method is to produce sacrificial anodes through a casting process. However, two casting methods can be distinguished.

The high pressure die-casting process for sacrificial anodes is widespread. It is a fully automated machine process. In order for the manufacturing process to run reliably and in a repeatable manner, a modification of the processed sacrificial anode alloy is required. Alternatively, the gravity casting process is used for the production of the sacrificial anodes. This process is performed manually or partially automated. The alloy does not have to be adapted to the manufacturing process, but is designed for 100% optimum corrosion protection.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Sylvère Gay, 1st Viscount of Martignac (20 June 1778 3 April 1832) was a moderate royalist French statesman during the Bourbon Restoration 1814–30 under King Charles X.

==Biography==
Martignac was born in Bordeaux, France. In 1798 he became secretary to Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès; after serving for a while in the army, he turned to literature, producing several light plays. Under the Empire he practised with success as an advocate at Bordeaux, where in 1818 he became advocate-general of the &quot;cour royale&quot;. In 1819 he was appointed &quot;procureur-général&quot; at Limoges, and in 1821 was returned for Marmande to the Chamber of Deputies, where he supported the ultraroyalist policies of Villèle. In 1822 he was appointed councillor of state, in 1823 he accompanied the duc d&#x27;Angouléme to Spain as civil commissary; in 1824 he was created a viscount and appointed director-general of registration.

In contact with practical politics his ultra-royalist views were gradually modified in the direction of the Doctrinaires, and on the fall of Villèle he was selected by Charles X to carry out the new policy of compromise. On 4 January 1828 he was appointed minister of the interior, and, though not bearing the title of president, became the virtual head of the cabinet. He succeeded in passing the act abolishing the press censorship, and in persuading the king to sign the ordinances of 16 June 1828 on the Jesuits and the little seminaries.

He was exposed to attack from both the extreme left and the extreme right, and when in April 1829 a coalition of these groups defeated him in the chamber, Charles X, who had never believed in the policy he represented, replaced him by the prince de Polignac. In March 1830 Martignac voted with the majority for the address protesting against the famous ordinances; but during the revolution that followed he remained true to his legitimist principles. His last public appearance was in defence of Polignac in the Chamber of Peers in December 1830.

<text>Terrier (from Latin &quot;terra&quot;, &#x27;earth&#x27;) is a type of dog originally bred to hunt vermin. A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of the terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, game, and fearless. There are five different groups of terrier, with each group having different shapes and sizes.

== History ==
Most terrier breeds were refined from the older purpose-bred dogs.

The gameness of the early hunting terriers was exploited by using them in sporting contests. Initially, terriers competed in events such as clearing a pit of rats. The dog that was the fastest in killing all the rats won. In the eighteenth century some terriers were crossed with hounds to improve their hunting, and some with fighting dog breeds to &quot;intensify tenacity and increase courage&quot;. Some of the crosses with fighting dogs, bull and terrier crosses, were used in the blood sport of dog-fighting. Modern pet breeds such as the Miniature Bull Terrier are listed by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) under Bull type terriers.

Today, most terriers are kept as companion dogs and family pets. They are generally loyal and affectionate to their owners.

==Terrier types and groups==
In the 18th century in Britain, only two types of terriers were recognized, long- and short-legged. Today, terriers are often informally categorized by size or by function.

Hunting-types are still used to find, track, or trail quarry, especially underground, and sometimes to bolt the quarry. Modern examples include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Jagdterrier, the Rat Terrier, and the Patterdale Terrier. There are also the short-legged terriers such as the Cairn Terrier, the Scottish Terrier, and the West Highland White Terrier, which were also used to kill small vermin.

The original hunting terriers include the Fell Terrier (developed in northern England to assist in the killing of foxes) and the Hunt Terrier (developed in southern England to locate, kill or bolt foxes during a traditional mounted fox hunt).

The various combinations of bulldog and terrier that were used for bull-baiting and dog-fighting in the late 19th century were later refined into separate breeds that combined both terrier and bulldog qualities. Except for the Boston Terrier, they are generally included in kennel clubs&#x27; Terrier Group. Breeders have bred modern bull-type terrier breeds, such as the Bull Terrier and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, into suitable family dogs and show terriers.

Toy terriers have been bred from larger terriers and are shown in the Toy or Companion group. Included among these breeds are the English Toy Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. While small, they retain true terrier character and are not submissive &quot;lap dogs&quot;.

Other descendants of the bull and terrier types, such as the Asian Gull Terrier, are among the dogs still raised for dog-fighting.

=== Appearance ===
Terriers range greatly in appearance from very small, light bodied, smooth coated dogs such as the English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan), which weighs as little as , to the very large rough-coated Airedale Terriers, which can be up to or more. As of 2004, the United Kennel Club recognized a new hairless breed of terrier derived from the Rat Terrier called the American Hairless Terrier.

==Kennel club classification==
When competing in conformation shows, most kennel clubs including the Fédération Cynologique Internationale group pedigree terrier breeds together in their own terrier group. The Fédération Cynologique Internationale grouped Terriers in Group 3.

<doc id="176427" wikidata="Q1055017" url="?curid=176427" title="Neutral theory of molecular evolution">
<text>The neutral theory of molecular evolution holds that most evolutionary changes occur at the molecular level, and most of the variation within and between species are due to random genetic drift of mutant alleles that are selectively neutral. The theory applies only for evolution at the molecular level, and is compatible with phenotypic evolution being shaped by natural selection as postulated by Charles Darwin.

The neutral theory allows for the possibility that most mutations are deleterious, but holds that because these are rapidly removed by natural selection, they do not make significant contributions to variation within and between species at the molecular level. A neutral mutation is one that does not affect an organism&#x27;s ability to survive and reproduce.

The neutral theory assumes that most mutations that are not deleterious are neutral rather than beneficial. Because only a fraction of gametes are sampled in each generation of a species, the neutral theory suggests that a mutant allele can arise within a population and reach fixation by chance, rather than by selective advantage.

The theory was introduced by the Japanese biologist Motoo Kimura in 1968, and independently by two American biologists Jack Lester King and Thomas Hughes Jukes in 1969, and described in detail by Kimura in his 1983 monograph &quot;The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution&quot;. The proposal of the neutral theory was followed by an extensive &quot;neutralist–selectionist&quot; controversy over the interpretation of patterns of molecular divergence and gene polymorphism, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s.

Neutral theory is frequently used as the null hypothesis, as opposed to adaptive explanations, for describing the emergence of morphological or genetic features in organisms and populations. This has been suggested in a number of areas, including in explaining genetic variation between populations of one nominal species, the emergence of complex subcellular machinery, and the convergent emergence of several typical microbial morphologies.

==Origins==

While some scientists, such as Freese (1962) and Freese and Yoshida (1965), had suggested that neutral mutations were probably widespread, the original mathematical derivation of the theory had been published by R.A. Fisher in 1930. Fisher, however, gave a reasoned argument for believing that, in practice, neutral gene substitutions would be very rare. A coherent theory of neutral evolution was first proposed by Motoo Kimura in 1968 and by King and Jukes independently in 1969. Kimura initially focused on differences among species; King and Jukes focused on differences within species.

Many molecular biologists and population geneticists also contributed to the development of the neutral theory. The principles of population genetics, established by J.B.S. Haldane, R.A. Fisher, and Sewall Wright, created a mathematical approach to analyzing gene frequencies that contributed to the development of Kimura&#x27;s theory.

Haldane&#x27;s dilemma regarding the cost of selection was used as motivation by Kimura. Haldane estimated that it takes about 300 generations for a beneficial mutation to become fixed in a mammalian lineage, meaning that the number of substitutions (1.5 per year) in the evolution between humans and chimpanzees was too high to be explained by beneficial mutations.

== Functional constraint ==
The neutral theory holds that as functional constraint diminishes, the probability that a mutation is neutral rises, and so should the rate of sequence divergence.

When comparing various proteins, extremely high evolutionary rates were observed in proteins such as fibrinopeptides and the C chain of the proinsulin molecule, which both have little to no functionality compared to their active molecules. Kimura and Ohta also estimated that the alpha and beta chains on the surface of a hemoglobin protein evolve at a rate almost ten times faster than the inside pockets, which would imply that the overall molecular structure of hemoglobin is less significant than the inside where the iron-containing heme groups reside.

There is evidence that rates of nucleotide substitution are particularly high in the third position of a codon, where there is little functional constraint. This view is based in part on the degenerate genetic code, in which sequences of three nucleotides (codons) may differ and yet encode the same amino acid (&quot;GCC&quot; and &quot;GCA&quot; both encode alanine, for example). Consequently, many potential single-nucleotide changes are in effect &quot;silent&quot; or &quot;unexpressed&quot; (see synonymous or silent substitution). Such changes are presumed to have little or no biological effect.

== Quantitative theory ==
Kimura also developed the infinite sites model (ISM) to provide insight into evolutionary rates of mutant alleles. If formula_1 were to represent the rate of mutation of gametes per generation of formula_2 individuals, each with two sets of chromosomes, the total number of new mutants in each generation is formula_3. Now let formula_4 represent the evolution rate in terms of a mutant allele formula_5 becoming fixed in a population.

:formula_6

According to ISM, selectively neutral mutations appear at rate formula_5 in each of the formula_8 copies of a gene, and fix with probability formula_9. Because any of the formula_8 genes have the ability to become fixed in a population, formula_11 is equal to formula_5, resulting in the rate of evolutionary rate equation:

:formula_13

This means that if all mutations were neutral, the rate at which fixed differences accumulate between divergent populations is predicted to be equal to the per-individual mutation rate, independent of population size. When the proportion of mutations that are neutral is constant, so is the divergence rate between populations. This provides a rationale for the molecular clock, which predated neutral theory. The ISM also demonstrates a constancy that is observed in molecular lineages.

This stochastic process is assumed to obey equations describing random genetic drift by means of accidents of sampling, rather than for example genetic hitchhiking of a neutral allele due to genetic linkage with non-neutral alleles. After appearing by mutation, a neutral allele may become more common within the population via genetic drift. Usually, it will be lost, or in rare cases it may become fixed, meaning that the new allele becomes standard in the population.

According to the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the amount of genetic variation within a species should be proportional to the effective population size.

==The &quot;neutralist–selectionist&quot; debate==
A heated debate arose when Kimura&#x27;s theory was published, largely revolving around the relative percentages of polymorphic and fixed alleles that are &quot;neutral&quot; versus &quot;non-neutral&quot;.

A genetic polymorphism means that different forms of particular genes, and hence of the proteins that they produce, are co-existing within a species. Selectionists claimed that such polymorphisms are maintained by balancing selection, while neutralists view the variation of a protein as a transient phase of molecular evolution. Studies by Richard K. Koehn and W. F. Eanes demonstrated a correlation between polymorphism and molecular weight of their molecular subunits. This is consistent with the neutral theory assumption that larger subunits should have higher rates of neutral mutation. Selectionists, on the other hand, contribute environmental conditions to be the major determinants of polymorphisms rather than structural and functional factors.

According to the neutral theory of molecular evolution, the amount of genetic variation within a species should be proportional to the effective population size. Levels of genetic diversity vary much less than census population sizes, giving rise to the &quot;paradox of variation&quot; . While high levels of genetic diversity were one of the original arguments in favor of neutral theory, the paradox of variation has been one of the strongest arguments against neutral theory.

There are a large number of statistical methods for testing whether neutral theory is a good description of evolution (e.g., McDonald-Kreitman test), and many authors claimed detection of selection. Some researchers have nevertheless argued that the neutral theory still stands, while expanding the definition of neutral theory to include background selection at linked sites.

==Nearly neutral theory==
Tomoko Ohta also emphasized the importance of nearly neutral mutations, in particularly slightly deleterious mutations. The Nearly neutral theory stems from the prediction of neutral theory that the balance between selection and genetic drift depends on effective population size. Nearly neutral mutations are those that carry selection coefficients less than the inverse of twice the effective population size. The population dynamics of nearly neutral mutations are only slightly different from those of neutral mutations unless the absolute magnitude of the selection coefficient is greater than 1/N, where N is the effective population size in respect of selection. The effective population size affects whether slightly deleterious mutations can be treated as neutral or as deleterious. In large populations, selection can decrease the frequency of slightly deleterious mutations, therefore acting as if they are deleterious. However, in small populations, genetic drift can more easily overcome selection, causing slightly deleterious mutations to act as if they are neutral and drift to fixation or loss.

== Constructive neutral evolution ==

The groundworks for the theory of constructive neutral evolution (CNE) was laid by two papers in the 1990s. Constructive neutral evolution is a theory which suggests that complex structures and processes can emerge through neutral transitions. Although a separate theory altogether, the emphasis on neutrality as a process whereby neutral alleles are randomly fixed by genetic drift finds some inspiration from the earlier attempt by the neutral theory to invoke its importance in evolution. Conceptually, there are two components A and B (which may represent two proteins) which interact with each other. A, which performs a function for the system, does not depend on its interaction with B for its functionality, and the interaction itself may have randomly arisen in an individual with the ability to disappear without an effect on the fitness of A. This present yet currently unnecessary interaction is therefore called an &quot;excess capacity&quot; of the system. However, a mutation may occur which compromises the ability of A to perform its function independently. However, the A:B interaction that has already emerged sustains the capacity of A to perform its initial function. Therefore, the emergence of the A:B interaction &quot;presuppresses&quot; the deleterious nature of the mutation, making it a neutral change in the genome that is capable of spreading through the population via random genetic drift. Hence, A has gained a dependency on its interaction with B. In this case, the loss of B or the A:B interaction would have a negative effect on fitness and so purifying selection would eliminate individuals where this occurs. While each of these steps are individually reversible (for example, A may regain the capacity to function independently or the A:B interaction may be lost), a random sequence of mutations tends to further reduce the capacity of A to function independently and a random walk through the dependency space may very well result in a configuration in which a return to functional independence of A is far too unlikely to occur, which makes CNE a one-directional or &quot;ratchet-like&quot; process. CNE, which does not invoke adaptationist mechanisms for the origins of more complex systems (which involve more parts and interactions contributing to the whole), has seen application in the understanding of the evolutionary origins of the spliceosomal eukaryotic complex, RNA editing, additional ribosomal proteins beyond the core, the emergence of long-noncoding RNA from junk DNA, and so forth. In some cases, ancestral sequence reconstruction techniques have afforded the ability for experimental demonstration of some proposed examples of CNE, as in heterooligomeric ring protein complexes in some fungal lineages.

CNE has also been put forwards as the null hypothesis for explaining complex structures, and thus adaptationist explanations for the emergence of complexity must be rigorously tested on a case-by-case basis against this null hypothesis prior to acceptance. Grounds for invoking CNE as a null include that it does not presume that changes offered an adaptive benefit to the host or that they were directionally selected for, while maintaining the importance of more rigorous demonstrations of adaptation when invoked so as to avoid the excessive flaws of adaptationism criticized by Gould and Lewontin.

== Empirical evidence for the neutral theory ==
Predictions derived from the neutral theory are generally supported in studies of molecular evolution. One of corollaries of the neutral theory is that the efficiency of positive selection is higher in populations or species with higher effective population sizes. This relationship between the effective population size and selection efficiency was evidenced by genomic studies of species including chimpanzee and human and domesticated species. In small populations (e.g., a population bottleneck during a speciation event), slightly deleterious mutations should accumulate. Data from various species supports this prediction in that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions between species generally exceeds that within species. In addition, nucleotide and amino acid substitutions generally accumulate over time in a linear fashion, which is consistent with neutral theory. Arguments against the neutral theory cite evidence of widespread positive selection and selective sweeps in genomic data. Empirical support for the neutral theory may vary depending on the type of genomic data studied and the statistical tools used to detect positive selection. For example, Bayesian methods for the detection of selected codon sites and McDonald-Kreitman tests have been criticized for their rate of erroneous identification of positive selection.

<text>ORWO (for &quot;ORiginal WOlfen&quot;) is a registered trademark of the company ORWO Net GmbH, based in Wolfen and is also traditionally known for black-and-white film products, made in Germany and sold under the ORWO brand.

ORWO was established in East Germany in 1964 as a brand for photographic film and magnetic tape, mainly produced at the former &quot;ORWO Filmfabrik Wolfen&quot; (now Chemical Park Bitterfeld-Wolfen). The Wolfen factory was founded by AGFA (Aktien-Gesellschaft für Anilin-Fabrikation) in 1910 and developed the first modern colour film which incorporated colour couplers, Agfacolor Neu, in 1936.

The partition of Germany after the Second World War saw AGFA divided, into Agfa AG, Leverkusen in West Germany, and VEB Film und Chemiefaserwerk Agfa Wolfen in East Germany, which later adopted the brand ORWO. The company was privatised in 1990 as ORWO AG, but film production ceased at Wolfen in 1994 following the liquidation of the company, with its constituent parts closed or sold off. The Industry and Film museum Wolfen now occupies part of the original factory.

One of the successor companies, FilmoTec GmbH was founded in 1998 to produce high quality black and white cinema and technical films, based in Wolfen under the ORWO brand (license rights are held by the ORWO Net GmbH). Currently, the ORWOFilm range incorporates negative film for motion picture production (UN54 and N75), duplicating film, print film, sound recording film, and film leaders for the processing and distribution business.

In 2020 FilmoTec was brought under common ownership under Seal 1818 GmbH with part of the film coating company InovisCoat GmbH, also based in Germany and with shared Agfa heritage to offer films for the film industry under the traditional brand “ORWO”. Subsequently these were branded &#x27;Original Wolfen&#x27;.

==History==
===AGFA===

A color dye factory was established at the Rummelsburger See near Berlin in 1867, its name was changed to AGFA (Actien-Gesellschaft für Anilin-Fabrikation) in 1873. The Wolfen factory was established by AGFA in 1910 and its original Leverkusen works (nr. Cologne) around the same time. In 1911, the first casting plant at Wolfen for polymer films (nitrocellulose) was built by AGFA. By 1925, with AGFA now part of the industrial conglomerate I.G. Farben, Wolfen was specialising in film production and Leverkusen photographic paper. In 1932, the process of making Triacetate Cellulose (TAC) film was patented at the Wolfen facility 

The Agfa Wolfen plant developed the first modern colour film, which incorporated colour couplers, Agfacolor Neu, in 1936, which simplified processing compared to its contemporary Kodak Kodachrome from 1935.

==== After World War II ====
On 20 April 1945, following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, the Wolfen plant was taken over by US forces, and important patents and other documents regarding the Agfacolor process were confiscated and handed over to Western competitors, such as Kodak and Ilford. As the plant was located in what was to become the Soviet zone of occupied Germany, the US forces then handed it over to the Soviet military administration, which dismantled large parts of the plant and moved it, with key German staff, to Svema in Shostka, Ukraine, where it formed the basis for the Soviet colour film industry.

AGFA was split into two companies each with one of the two plants: Agfa AG, Leverkusen in West Germany, and VEB Film und Chemiefaserwerk Agfa Wolfen in East Germany. Agfa AG (Leverkusen), by then a subsidiary of Bayer was subsequently merged with Gevaert based in Mortsel, Belgium in 1964 to form Agfa-Gevaert.

===ORWO (VEB Film und Chemiefaserwerk) ===

On the last day of 1953, Agfa Wolfen was returned to the GDR by the USSR as one of the last reparations companies. At this time the company still shared the AGFA trademark with Agfa Leverkusen and both companies produced films under the AGFA brand with the same names, such as Isopan F. To distinguish them, the film edge markings were L IF for Agfa Leverkusen, and W IF for Agfa Wolfen. Trading of materials however continued between plants.

In 1953 in a trade agreement it was agreed that VEB Film- und Chemiefaserwerk Agfa Wolfen would have the sole rights to the AGFA brand in Eastern Europe and Agfa AG, would retain sole rights to the AGFA brand in the rest of the world. This hampered Wolfens exports and therefore after 1964 films from Wolfen were rebranded ORWO (ORiginal WOlfen).

After the formation of the Combine &quot;VEB Fotochemisches Kombinat Wolfen&quot; in 1970, the &quot;VEB Filmfabrik Wolfen&quot; became its headquarters. Factories integrated into the new Fotochemisches Kombinat were &quot;VEB Fotopapierwerk Dresden&quot;, &quot;VEB Fotopapierwerk Wernigerode&quot;, &quot;VEB Gelatinewerk Calbe&quot;, &quot;VEB Fotochemische Werke Berlin&quot; and the &quot;VEB Foto- und Lichtpauspapierwerk Berlin&quot;. The now Kombinat also began developing and producing other information recording materials, such as magnetic, video and computer tapes.

ORWO-branded 35mm colour slide film became available in the United Kingdom in the 1970s through magazine advertisements for mail order suppliers. It was a cheaper alternative to the mainstream brands available at the time.

ORWO prepared the changeover from AgfaColor to C-41, similar to considerations in the USSR, but had not completed until the end of the GDR, which led to decreasing sales figures in the western countries, where the Kodak C-41 process dominated the market.

In 1989, at its peak, a total of 14,500 employees were employed at the Wolfen site, encompassing an area of 165 hectares. They produced 40 million square meters of base material, of which 50 percent was processed to raw film. There were 2,500 assemblies, producing a total of 200 different film types. The production height of magnetic recording materials was 2 million square meters, and in the chemical fibre sector, around 100,000 tons of various pulp, viscose products and special products were delivered.

====Privatisation and Breakup====
Following German reunification in 1990 the holding company was privatised as ORWO AG with Folienwerk Wolfen GmbH an early spin off. The Treuhand liquidated the company in 1994 and film production ceased. Attempts were made to revive the company and in 1995, Berlin-based photo merchant Heinrich Mandermann joined ORWO, and on April 1, 1996, ORWO films were put back on the market. However, they were no longer produced locally, merely assembled from products from other manufacturers such as Forte and Ilford. Due to the owners illness the company was again insolvent in 1997.

A number of separate successor companies emerged from the remnants of the former industrial behemoth;
* &quot;Folienwerk Wolfen GmbH&quot; founded 1991, PET films for packaging, printing, medical and industrial uses.
* &quot;Organica Feinchemie GmbH Wolfen&quot;, founded in 1995, organic fine chemistry.
* &quot;FEW Chemicals GmbH&quot;, founded 1997, speciality and fine chemistry.
* &quot;Island Polymer Industries GmbH&quot;, founded 1998, Triacetate Cellulose (TAC) film production using former ORWO Wolfen facility, for photographic (film base) and optical markets, largest cast film manufacturer in Europe.
* &quot;ORWO FilmoTec GmbH&quot;, founded 1998, Cine films and related technical films.
* &quot;ORWO Net AG&quot;, founded 1999, Digital photo supplies, photofinishing.
All suppliers for the optical, electrical and film industries 

The ORWO Net GmbH retained the rights to the ORWO trademark for a variety of photographic products.

=== FilmoTec GmbH ===

The &quot;FilmoTec GmbH&quot; was formed in 1998 to continue to manufacture a range of Black and white camera and technical films for motion picture use under the ORWO brand. Film coating was contracted out, to Ilford and later InovisCoat. In 2020, twenty employees work in the areas of research, development, production, configuration, and distribution of ORWO black and white films.

Products are particularly aimed towards the technical needs of the world&#x27;s archiving, motion picture, and holographic industries. FilmoTec is, with Kodak, now one of only two companies still producing black and white films for motion picture use.

In partnership with ORWO North America, ORWO film currently supplies all US Library of Congress black and white industrial films, in addition to high-profile archival clients like the Smithsonian and MOMA. For example, black-and-white movies that have been selected by the US Library of Congress for archival copy preservation in the last five years have been most likely reprocessed onto ORWO film.

=== Seal 1818 GmbH ===
In 2020 FilmoTec was brought under common ownership with film coating company InovisCoat, based in Monheim am Rhein, Germany to offer products for the film industry under the traditional brand “ORWO”, both companies sharing AGFA heritage.
In particular the new ownership structure with Filmotec and InovisCoat together with a number of other companies unites the &#x27;ORWO&#x27; films, their Intellectual Property, Recipes and Research &amp; Development with access to film manufacturing capabilities for the first time since ORWO AGs liquidation in 1994.

InovisCoat was founded by former employees of the consumer film division of Agfa-Gevaert, with its film coating plant based at Leverkusen, Germany which was spun off into a new company Agfa-Photo in 2004. The company (Agfa-Photo GmbH) folded a year later in 2005, although a separate holding company still retains the license rights to the Agfa-Photo brand. InovisCoat brought together technical expertise in film emulsions and coating with acquisition of one of the former Leverkusen wide coating machines for film production, and a smaller narrow coating machine for testing, relocated to new premises in Monnheim on Rhein, the new smaller scale facility capable of multi-layer film coating for both photographic and other applications. It undertakes the manufacture of coated films for a number of companies including Polaroid B.V., Adox, Bergger, Lomography and ORWO Filmotec. The company was subsequently split into two parts in 2012; InovisProject owning the assets which was acquired by its major customer Polaroid B.V and Inoviscoat Photo, later renamed back to Inoviscoat, having access to the equipment, but owning no assets.

The companies being brought together under the ORWO name; holding company Seal 1818 GmbH, FilmoTec GmbH and InovisCoat GmbH underwent an organised restructure in 2022, to enable the introduction of new working practices and products. It was originally proposed to launch new products under the ORWO name and Logo, this was replaced by &#x27;Original Wolfen&#x27;, as ORWO Net GmbH still holds all brand rights.

Filmotec announced the introduction of two new films to the market in 2022, a new black &amp; white film for still camera use &#x27;NP100&#x27; and a new colour cine film stock &#x27;NC500&#x27; using ECN-2 development process, which would provide cinematographers with an alternative to the Kodak vision 3 colour camera stocks.

<text>Jean-Philibert Damiron (; 10 January 1794 – 11 January 1862) was a French philosopher.

==Biography==
Damiron was born at Belleville. At nineteen he entered the École Normale, where he studied under Eugène Burnouf, Abel-Francois Villemain, and Victor Cousin. After teaching for several years in provincial towns, he came to Paris, where he lectured on philosophy in various institutions, and finally became professor in the normal school, and titular professor at the Sorbonne. In 1824 he joined Paul-François Dubois and Théodore Simon Jouffroy in establishing &quot;Le Globe&quot;; and he was also a member of the committee of the society which took for its motto &quot;Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera&quot;. In 1833 he was appointed chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and in 1836 member of the Academy of Moral Sciences. Damiron died in Paris.

==Works==
Damiron works are known for his accounts of French philosophers:
* &quot;Nouveaux mélanges philosophiques de Jouffroy&quot; (1842), one edition contained a notice of the author, in which Damiron softened and omitted several expressions used by Jouffroy, which were opposed to the system of education adopted by the Sorbonne.
* &quot;De la mutilation des manuscrits de M. Jouffroy&quot; (1843), an article which gave rise to a bitter controversy, and to a book by Pierre Leroux, .
* &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;histoire de la philosophie en France au XIXe siècle&quot; (1828, 3rd ed. 1834)
* &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;histoire de la philosophie en France au XVIIe siècle&quot; (1846)
* &quot;Mémoires a servir pour l&#x27;histoire de la philosophie en France au XVIIIe siècle&quot; (1858-1864)
* &quot;Cours de la philosophie&quot;
* &quot;De la Providence&quot; (1849, 1850)

<text>John Playfair FRSE, FRS (10 March 1748 – 20 July 1819) was a Church of Scotland minister, remembered as a scientist and mathematician, and a professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. He is best known for his book &quot;Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth&quot; (1802), which summarised the work of James Hutton. It was through this book that Hutton&#x27;s principle of uniformitarianism, later taken up by Charles Lyell, first reached a wide audience. Playfair&#x27;s textbook &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot; made a brief expression of Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate known now as Playfair&#x27;s axiom.

In 1783 he was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He served as General Secretary to the society 1798–1819.

==Life==
Born at Benvie, slightly west of Dundee to Margaret Young (1719/20 – 1805) and Reverend James Playfair (died 1772), the kirk minister of Liff and Benvie.

Playfair was educated at home until the age of 14, when he entered the University of St Andrews to study divinity. He also did further studies at Edinburgh University. In 1766, when only 18, he was a candidate for the chair of mathematics in Marischal College (now part of the University of Aberdeen), and, although he was unsuccessful, his claims were admitted to be high.

Six years later (1772) he applied for the chair of natural philosophy (physics) at St Andrews University, but again without success. In 1773 he was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland and was offered the united parishes of Liff and his home parish of Benvie (made vacant by the death of his father). However, Playfair chose to continue his studies in mathematics and physics, and in 1782 he resigned his charge to become the tutor of Adam Ferguson. By this arrangement Playfair regularly visited Edinburgh and went on to cultivate the literary and scientific society for which the city was at that time specially distinguished. In particular, he attended the natural history course of John Walker. Through Nevil Maskelyne, whose acquaintance he had first made in the course of the celebrated Schiehallion experiments in 1774, he also gained access to the scientific circles of London. In 1785 when Dugald Stewart succeeded Ferguson in the University of Edinburgh Chair of Moral Philosophy, Playfair succeeded the former to become the chair of mathematics.
In 1795 Playfair published an alternative, more stringent formulation of Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate, which is now called Playfair&#x27;s axiom. Although the axiom bears Playfair&#x27;s name, he did not create it, but credited others, in particular William Ludlam with its prior use.

In 1802 Playfair published his celebrated volume entitled &quot;Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth.&quot; The influence exerted by James Hutton on the development of geology is thought to be largely due to its publication. In 1805 Playfair exchanged the Chair of Mathematics for that of natural philosophy in succession to John Robison, whom also he succeeded as general secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He took a prominent part, on the liberal side, in the ecclesiastical controversy that arose in connection with Sir John Leslie&#x27;s appointment to the post he had vacated, and published a satirical letter (1806).

He moved from 6 Buccleuch Place to a new house at 2 Albany Street (then called Albany Row) in 1807.

Playfair was an opponent of Gottfried Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;vis viva&quot; principle, an early version of the conservation of energy. In 1808, he launched an attack on John Smeaton and William Hyde Wollaston&#x27;s work championing the theory. In 1808 he also published a review of Laplace&#x27;s &quot;Traité de Mécanique Celeste&quot;.

He died at 2 Albany Street on 20 July 1819. He is buried nearby in Old Calton Burial Ground (a secular burial ground).

==Family==

Playfair&#x27;s brothers were architect James Playfair, solicitor Robert Playfair and engineer William Playfair. His nephew, William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) was an eminent architect in Scotland.

In later life he admired and proposed to the wealthy widow Jane Apreece. She turned him down and married Sir Humphry Davy.

He died of strangury on 20 July 1819, and, although an eminent man, was buried in an unmarked grave in Old Calton Burial Ground, on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh. His, and his brother, James&#x27;s graves were marked by a plaque unveiled in 2011 following a local campaign. The monument to his memory by William Henry Playfair, on Calton Hill, is visible from the spot.

==Honours==

*Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh
*Fellow of the Royal Society of London, 1807
*Craters on Mars and the Moon were named in his honour.
* The mineral playfairite was named in his honour.

==Critical bibliography==
A four-volume collected edition of Playfair&#x27;s works, with a memoir by James G. Playfair, appeared at Edinburgh in 1822.

His writings include a number of essays contributed to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; from 1804 onwards, various papers in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; (including his earliest publication, &quot;&quot;On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities&quot;, 1779, and an &quot;Account of the Lithological Survey of Schehallion&quot;&quot;, 1811) and in the &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot; (&quot;On the Causes which Affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements&quot; and others), the articles &quot;&quot;Aepinus&quot; and &quot;Physical Astronomy&quot;&quot;, and a &quot;Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science since the Revival of Learning in Europe&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (Supplement to fourth, fifth and sixth editions). He also took an interest in Indian astronomy and compared them with traditional and ancient astronomy from Egypt and Greece. He also examined Indian concepts in trigonometry.

His &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot; first appeared in 1795 and has passed through many editions; his &quot;Outlines of Natural Philosophy&quot; (2 vols., 1812–1816) consist of the propositions and formulae which were the basis of his class lectures. Playfair&#x27;s contributions to pure mathematics were not considerable, his papers &quot;On the Arithmetic of Impossible Quantities&quot; and &quot;On the Causes which Affect the Accuracy of Barometrical Measurements&quot;, and his &quot;Elements of Geometry&quot;, all already referred to, being the most important. His lives of Matthew Stewart, Hutton, and Robison, many of his reviews, and above all his &quot;Dissertation&quot; are of the utmost value.

<doc id="176452" wikidata="Q1470206" url="?curid=176452" title="Leather subculture">
<text>Leather subculture denotes practices and styles of dress organized around sexual activities that involve leather garments, such as leather jackets, vests, boots, chaps, harnesses, or other items. Wearing leather garments is one way that participants in this culture self-consciously distinguish themselves from mainstream sexual cultures. Many participants associate leather culture with BDSM practices and its many subcultures. For some, black leather clothing is an erotic fashion that expresses heightened masculinity or the appropriation of sexual power; love of motorcycles, motorcycle clubs and independence; and/or engagement in sexual kink or leather fetishism.

==History==
The emergence of gay leather as a coherent subculture can be traced back to the second half of the 1940s and the 1950s in major cities of the US. Later, it also developed in other urban centers in most industrialized capitalist countries. While gay leather developed 20 years after heterosexual European and American fetish styles, it did so relatively isolated from those existing circles and organizations.

Although there is some evidence of BDSM activities among gay men before the Second World War, this &quot;pre-leather&quot; scene has not been extensively researched. Due to pathologization and criminal prosecution of homosexuality and kinkiness in many parts of the world, many practitioners were extremely cautious and secretive about their activities. As a result, only few sources have survived. The same is true for the early days of the leather scene after World War II. One exception is Samuel Steward (1909–1993) who lived in the US and extensively documented his kinky sexual encounters with other men. He also was part of a study of gay BDSM practices by Alfred Kinsey in 1949.

=== Formative Years (1940–1968) ===
The formative period of gay leather subculture took place in the 1940s and 1950s. It mainly originated from two groups: Post-WWII California bikers in Los Angeles and &quot;pre-leather&quot; butch BDSM practitioners in New York City. The leather look first emerged in Los Angeles and subsequently was adopted by men in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco in subsequent years. A significant portion of the leather community consisted of queer servicemen and servicewomen returning from WWII, who were congregating in large US cities after returning to their home country in 1945 and 1946.
In Los Angeles, the gay leather scene developed from a broader biker-leather culture. Protective motorcycle clothing at this time was made of tough leather, usually cowhide or horsehide. Biker culture reflected a disaffection with the mainstream culture of post-World War II America, a disaffection whose notoriety — and therefore appeal — expanded after the sensationalized news coverage of the Hollister &quot;riot&quot; of 1947. The 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;, starring Marlon Brando wearing jeans, a T-shirt, a leather jacket, and cloth biker cap that later inspired leather bike caps, played on pop-cultural fascination with the Hollister &quot;riot&quot; and promoted an image of masculine independence that resonated with some men who were dissatisfied with mainstream culture. &quot;The Wild One&quot; has been quoted numerous times as formative imagery by leathermen, who described its leather look as masculine, sexual and radical. Although the film didn&#x27;t create the symbolics of leather, it helped to standardize the masculine leather aesthetic and provided it with nationwide exposure. Artists such as Tom of Finland and Etienne, whose suggestive drawings of well-endowed leather-clad muscle men were published in &quot;Physique Pictorial&quot; and elsewhere, contributed to the spread of the outlaw biker aesthetic among gay men. Motorcycle culture also reflected some men&#x27;s disaffection with the cultures more organized around high culture, popular culture (especially musical theater), and/or camp style.

Pioneering gay motorcycle clubs included the Satyrs Motorcycle Club, established in Los Angeles in 1954; Oedipus Motorcycle Club in Los Angeles, which split from the Satyrs in 1958. As well, the gay leather community that emerged from the motorcycle clubs also became the practical and symbolic location for men&#x27;s open exploration of kink and S&amp;M. Even in those early years, different styles of gay male leather practices could be observed: Strict, formal S&amp;M that was based on military traditions, informal &quot;rough sex&quot; or &quot;buddy sexuality&quot; associated with motorcycle clubs, and leather fetishism, as well as a mixture of all of those three. These varied widely between regions, causing much debate today over which traditions are the original or true traditions, or whether the &quot;romanticized versions of leather history&quot; ever existed at all. Over time, the practitioners of kink and BDSM were joined by those who were primarily interested in the aesthetics and atmosphere of the leather scene.

New York City, which was a hub for queer life at the time, had a small community of gay BDSM practitioners that was already established in the 1940s. It was organized in the form of informal social networks, mostly through word of mouth and supplemented by encoded personal ads in newspapers. Another fixture were private parties by local players. One facilitator of recurring parties between 1950 and 1953 was Bob Milne, who had moved from Boston to New York City after multiple altercations with law enforcement, including a conviction for homosexual acts in his home. He was well known beyond the city limits.

The New Yorker community appropriated California-style biker leather got appropriated in the mid-1950s, probably around the release of The Wild One (1953). Dedicated motorcycle clubs didn&#x27;t emerge in New York City until the 1960s, though. The earliest documented bars frequented by leathermen were a cluster of venues in New York City at 50th Street and 3rd Avenue, called the &quot;bird circuit&quot;, namely the Golden Pheasant Restaurant, the Blue Parrot Cafe and the Swan Club. Later, Shaw&#x27;s (1953), the Lodge (1954) and the Big Dollar (1959) emerged as early &quot;leather-friendly&quot; bars. The lodge also imposed a dress code of leather, meaning mostly leather motorcycle jackets.

After Milne&#x27;s departure in 1953 Frank Olson became a central player in New York City, mostly by facilitating contacts between practitioners via telephone and in leather-friendly bars, and organizing private parties in New York City and at Fire Island resort. Especially during the mid-60s crackdown on gay bars leading up to the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair he held the loose group together. In 1970 Olson opened his own leather bar with his lover Don Morrison, the Eagle&#x27;s Nest, later renamed the Eagle.

Dedicated leather bars slowly emerged between the 1950s and the 1960s in major Cities of the US (notably New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco) and in Europe, gaining immense popularity in the 1970s. According to Lucas Hilderbrand, leather bars played an important role by giving the scene coherence as well as providing sites for assembly. Especially in the period before Stonewall, the patrons were regularly threatened by police raids. In contrast, the motorcycle clubs&#x27; regular bike runs provided opportunities for undisturbed partying and sex outdoors. In the 1970s, leather bars also became sponsors of leather contests, as well as sexual spaces (sex in bars was illegal, but mostly tolerated), evident in the back rooms, dark corners or basements which had become a regular feature of many establishments.

From the 1960s onward, leather bars became a central fixture of gay leather life, that provided a gathering space for the community and a point of entry into the scene for newcomers. Bars also played a key role in turning leather into a consumable aesthetic and identity, often enforced by dress codes. Several influencal authors, who would later write about the leather subculture, are known to have joined the scene during the mid-1960s, among them Joseph Bean, Guy Baldwin, and John Preston. As Guy Baldwin stated:

The first leather bars had their origins in ordinary venues that were regularly patronized by groups of leathermen. The best-known example of this is the Gold Coast in Chicago, which became a popular meeting place for the local scene in the late 1950s. After the unexpected death of the owner, Chuck Renslow bought it and reopened as a queer-owned leather bar in 1960. An iconic feature were the murals done by Renslow&#x27;s partner Dom Orejudos (pen name Etienne), who also designed its logo and posters.

In San Francisco, South of Market became the hub of the leather subculture in the gay community in 1962 when the Tool Box opened its doors as the first leather bar in the neighborhood. operated from 1962 to 1971 on the east corner of 4th Street and Harrison Street and was often frequented by motorcycle clubs like the Satyrs and Oedipus. The Tool Box became famous nationwide due to the June 1964 Paul Welch &quot;Life&quot; article entitled &quot;Homosexuality In America,&quot; the first time a national publication reported on gay issues. &quot;Life&quot;″s photographer was referred to the Tool Box by Hal Call, who had long worked to dispel the myth that all homosexual men were effeminate. The article opened with a two-page spread of the mural of life size leathermen in the bar, which had been painted by Chuck Arnett in 1962. The article described San Francisco as &quot;The Gay Capital of America&quot; and inspired many gay leathermen to move there. When the Stud, along with Febe&#x27;s, opened up on Folsom Street in San Francisco in 1966, other gay leather bars and establishments catering to the leather subculture followed creating a foundation for the growing gay leather community.

=== The Golden Age (1969–1982) ===
The 1970s are considered the heyday of leather culture, also referred to as the Golden Age. During this time, the subculture grew by leaps and bounds worldwide, accompanied by increasing organization, diversification, improving networks and visibility. Leather bars became sponsors of leather contests, inspired by beauty pageants, as well as sexual spaces (sex in bars was illegal, but mostly tolerated), evident in the back rooms, dark corners or basements which had become a regular feature of many establishments. Another feature of US-leather bars in the 1970s were bootblacks, e.g. the Gold Coast in Chicago and the Ramrod in New York City were fitted with bootblack stands. Another new development was the hanky code, which communicated sexual preferences through colored handkerchiefs.

The first leather contest was most likely the &quot;Mr. Gold Coast&quot; pageant held in 1972 in the Gold Coast in Chicago, which was rebranded as International Mr. Leather in 1979. Notable sex clubs of the time include the Mineshaft (1976–1985) in New York City, Inferno weekend in Chicago (since 1976) and the Catacombs (1975–1984) in San Francisco. The &quot;leather daddy&quot; archetype from the late 1970s, which has sadomasochistic associations, led to the creation of the daddy archetype in queer culture.

While the scene had functioned via oral tradition and personal referral in the previous decades, the rapid growth in numerous cities was accompanied by the emergence of printed publications. This also led to greater formalization and standardization — the communities on the East and West coasts had previously developed differing traditions, such as whether S or M stood for sadist and masochist or for slave and master, or on which side keys were worn to indicate one&#x27;s role. Larry Townsend&#x27;s &quot;The Leatherman&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1972) is considered the first non-fiction book about the leather scene. In 1974, the first issue of &quot;Drummer&quot; magazine was published in Los Angeles, which was the most successful of the American leather magazines, and sold overseas. The publication had a major impact of spreading gay leather as a lifestyle and masculinity as a gay ideal. The magazine was focused on quality writings about leather, accompanied by erotic foto series and illustrations, and written erotica. For example, the erotic novel Mr. Benson by John Preston was first published in serialized form in &quot;Drummer&quot; magazine between 1979 and 1980 with a claimed press run of 42,000 copies per issue.

In the 1970s Berlin, Germany had a huge leather scene with several leather clubs in the area around Nollendorfplatz. The pornographic films of one of Tom of Finland&#x27;s models Peter Berlin from Berlin, such as his 1973 film &quot;Nights in Black Leather,&quot; also reflected and promoted the leather subcultural aesthetic. In 1975, Europe&#x27;s biggest fetish event started, &quot;Easter Berlin Leather Festival,&quot; organized annually by Berlin Leder und Fetisch e.V. MSC Hamburg began hosting an annual &quot;international leather-party&quot; in Hamburg in 1972. Also in Europe younger men combined the aesthetic and exploration of sexual power with the gay skinhead movement and social-fraternal organizations, from the late 1970s.

Cynthia Slater&#x27;s activism for women to be accepted within the gay leather scene in San Francisco during the late 1970s brought her to mainstream attention. Slater persuaded the management of San Francisco&#x27;s S/M leather club the Catacombs, the most famous fisting club in the world, to open up to lesbians; it was originally a gay men&#x27;s club. It operated from 1975 to 1981, and reopened at another location from 1982 to 1984. Slater was also an early proponent of S/M safety, and one of the major AIDS activists and educators during the late 1970s. Slater hosted Society of Janus safety demonstrations during the late 1970s, cultivating a space for women within the &#x27;plurality of gay men&#x27; already present within the leather/kink/fetish Venn-diagramatic culture.

Pat Califia, who identified as a lesbian at the time, was an activist in the San Francisco leather subculture, and is credited for defining the emergence of lesbian leather subculture. On June 13, 1978, Pat Califia, Gayle Rubin, and sixteen others co-founded Samois, a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983 and was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States. (More under &quot;Lesbian&quot; below). In recent decades the leather community has been considered a subset of BDSM culture rather than the BDSM community being considered a subset of leather culture. Even so, the most visibly organized SM community related to leather has been a subculture of leather, as evidenced by the American competition known as International Mr. Leather (IML, established 1979), and SM in the UK (established 1981). International Ms. Leather was first held in 1987.

In 1979 the newly formed San Francisco lesbian motorcycle club, Dykes on Bikes, led what was then called the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade for the first time and has done so ever since. Since 1994, the event has been called the San Francisco Pride Parade. The parade now has a leather contingent. By the mid-1980s, lesbian motorcycle enthusiasts in other cities besides San Francisco began to form motorcycle clubs.

Leather and Lace, a woman&#x27;s leather/BDSM support and social group, was founded in Los Angeles in 1980. The women of Leather and Lace learned the &quot;old guard&quot; traditions from the men of Avatar. Leather and Lace had a code of conduct and a uniform that could only be worn once a member earned the right.

=== The Age of Political Mobilization (1983–present) ===
The leather community was hit hard by several effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the mid-1980s. In the 1980s and early 1990s, lesbian leatherwomen were often involved in helping to care for gay leathermen who had been stricken with AIDS. In addition, leather title holders used their platform for fundraising purposes and advocacy work, and kinksters became more active in existing rights groups, joining the fight against AIDS. On the one hand, the leather community faced increased hostility—both mainstream society and the vanilla queer community blamed the allegedly &quot;extreme&quot; and &quot;unsafe&quot; sex practices of gay kinksters for the outbreak of the epidemic, with fisting being especially frowned upon. On the other hand, a nationwide political campaign to close sex clubs, bathhouses and similar establishments was successful, and within a few years many institutions that had played a central role within the community were shut down. The forced closing of bathhouses and increased regulation of leather bars sped up the ongoing gentrification in big cities, that already threatened their existence, so that the leather districts shrank rapidly after the explosive expansion of the 1970s.

In 1984, the Folsom Street Fair in San Francisco was held for the first time, made possible by housing activists and community organizers, to provide means for fundraising, and create opportunities for members of the leather community to connect to services and vital information (e.g., regarding safer sex) that bathhouses and bars might otherwise have been situated to distribute. It was and still is the world&#x27;s largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture.

Jack Fritscher&#x27;s short-story collection &quot;Corporal in Charge of Taking Care of Captain O&#x27;Malley&quot; (Gay Sunshine Press, 1984) was the first collection of leather fiction, and the first collection of fiction from &quot;Drummer&quot;. The title entry &quot;Corporal in Charge&quot; was the only play published by editor Winston Leyland in the Lambda Literary Award winner &quot;Gay Roots: Twenty Years of Gay Sunshine - An Anthology of Gay History, Sex, Politics &amp; Culture&quot; (1991).

Competing in the 1986 International Mr. Leather contest inspired Steve Maidhof to organize a conference for members of the growing leather, SM, and fetish community, which would focus on education and political activism. To host this conference, named &quot;Living in Leather&quot;, Maidhof recruited several friends and leading members of Seattle&#x27;s leather community including: Cookie Andrews-Hunt, Wayne Gloege, Billy Jefferson, Jan Lyon, George Nelson, and Vik Stump. Together, they formed the National Leather Association (NLA), which officially incorporated in the summer of 1986. In October, they hosted the first &quot;Living in Leather&quot; (LIL) conference. Adding &quot;International&quot; to its name in 1991, the National Leather Association-International staged &quot;Living in Leather&quot; gatherings until 2002. After a period of decline around the turn of the millennium, NLA-I has become more active again and runs a series of awards for fiction and non-fiction writing.
In 1987, Judy Tallwing McCarthey was the leather community&#x27;s keynote speaker at the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights.

The leather community doubled down on its efforts to depathologize consensual BDSM and end the stigmatization of BDSM practitioners. From 1987 onwards, leathermen Race Bannon and Guy Baldwin in particular campaigned for the removal of BDSM practices from the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM). The current version of the DSM, DSM-5, excludes consensual BDSM from diagnosis when the sexual interests cause no harm or distress.

The Leather Archives &amp; Museum in Chicago was founded in 1991 by Chuck Renslow and Tony DeBlase as a “community archives, library, and museum of leather, kink, fetish, and BDSM history and culture.”

In 1997 the (American) National Coalition for Sexual Freedom was founded; the NCSF&#x27;s mission as described on its web page is:
In 2002, an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; publicly highlighted Jack McGeorge&#x27;s leadership in the Washington, D.C. leather and BDSM community. McGeorge had made no attempt to conceal his involvement in the BDSM and leather lifestyles; his full name appeared prominently on websites, and he said as much to the &quot;Post&quot; and other media. He did, however, offer his resignation to Hans Blix, hoping to preserve the credibility of his organization (the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, called UNMOVIC) before the weapons inspections in Iraq. Blix refused to accept McGeorge&#x27;s resignation. Later, Hua Jiang, spokeswoman for U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, said that being into BDSM was no more likely to be a cross-cultural problem in the Middle East than any number of other issues.

Mark Leno was the first out leatherman to be a state legislator in the United States; he served in the California State Assembly from 2002 to 2008.
In 2005 Viola Johnson started The Carter/Johnson Library &amp; Collection, a “collection of thousands of books, magazines, posters, art, club and event pins, newspapers, event programs and ephemera showing leather, fetish, S/M erotic history.&quot;

In 2009 the Leather Hall of Fame began inducting members.

Leather &amp; Grace, a (now defunct) organization of Unitarian Universalist kinksters, was founded in 2011, and combined a red flaming chalice with the stripes of the leather pride flag for their logo.
The LGBTQ and Leather Cultural District was created in South of Market, San Francisco in 2018. It includes the San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, with four works of art, which opened in 2017.

In 2024, the San Francisco Recreation and Park Commission voted to name a park at Natoma and 11th streets Rachele Sullivan Park. As she (Rachele Sullivan) was a leather leader, this vote meant San Francisco is believed to be the first American city to name any public park after a leather leader.

Lately, the leather subculture is one of many facets to semi-organized alternative sexuality. Many individuals describe long periods of introspection leading to their choice to identify as &quot;leather&quot;. Others do not necessarily associate their leather lifestyle with BDSM, and simply enjoy the sensory experience of leather.

== The Myth of the Old Guard ==
Today, the term &quot;Old Guard&quot;, &quot;Old Leather&quot; or &quot;Old Guard Leather&quot; has several meanings. Originally, &quot;Old Guard&quot; refers to the beginnings of the leather scene, from around the end of WWII in 1945 to the mid or late 1960s. Over the decades, this early period has been so strongly romanticized and idealized, both in fictional works and by practitioners themselves, that it is considered the origin myth of the leather subculture by some, and its roots by others. An example of this are the fictional works of Thom Magister. The Old Guard is usually portrayed as a secret close-knit community of like-minded men (e.g. in the form of motorcycle clubs), who developed a uniform hierarchical, high-protocol set of BDSM practices based on military models and lived according to a strict ethics, that included initiation, brotherhood, discipline and the pursuit of excellence. This &quot;pure form&quot; of leather culture allegedly was increasingly pushed underground in the 1960s, when the first leather bars established themselves and the leather scene received an enormous influx of newcomers, not all of whom were interested in the BDSM and fetish aspects of the scene. This narrative often includes serious criticism of the increasing commodification and politicization of the leather scene, as well as the introduction of safety principles like &quot;sane, safe, consensual&quot; (SSC), the inclusion and further education of outsiders, which all slowly gained momentum in the 1960s and reached a peak in the 1980s.

The discourse about the Old Guard and its historical existence has mainly been conducted since the end of the 1980s. One example of this is the anthology &quot;Leatherfolk: radical sex, people, politics, and practice&quot; by Mark Thompson, which was published in 1992 and brought together different, sometimes contradictory perspectives on leather culture. The term &quot;New Guard&quot; or &quot;New Leather&quot; emerged in distinction from &quot;Old Guard&quot;, with both often being portrayed as polar opposites—casual versus strict, informal versus formal. But as Gayle Rubin, Jack Rinella and Joseph Bean have pointed out, both of those expressions existed from the start within the subculture.

With this context in mind, today &quot;Old Guard&quot; is often used pejoratively to describe older members of the leather community who hold conservative views which are seen as outdated or toxic, e.g. in terms of &quot;correct&quot; behavior or the inclusion of different groups of people within the scene.

There have been several revival attempts of a leather culture modeled after the ideal of the Old Guard, such as John Weal&#x27;s &quot;The Leatherman&#x27;s Protocol Handbook&quot; (2010). The author refers to his initiation by Old Guard instructors and presents a uniform protocol that allegedly all traditional leathermen followed. However, the book has been criticized as not being true to the historical facts, and incorporates practices which can be traced back to different sources, such as submissive positions of heterosexual Gorean BDSM.

==Subcultures==
Today, while some may still use the term strictly in the old-fashioned sense (i.e., the romanticized Old Guard), more than ever the leather subculture in the 21st century represents the activities of several major sub-communities. These include BDSM practitioners, and people who have a preference for aggressive or masculine sexual styles; people who love motorcycles; people involved in kink or leather fetishism; and people who participate in large-scale cultural and marketing events such as Folsom Street Fair or leather-themed circuit parties.

===Lesbians===
Although gay men are the most visible demographic of the leather community, there are numerous women who identify as leatherwomen – and women have the International Ms. Leather (IMsL) event as their corollary to International Mr. Leather (IML). An example of a leatherwoman is Joan Jett, who has a leather pride sticker prominently displayed on her guitar.

Relatively few lesbian women were visible during the early emergence of the leather subculture. Patrick Califia, a trans man who identified as a lesbian at the time, was an activist in the San Francisco leather subculture, and is credited for defining the emergence of lesbian leather subculture. On June 13, 1978, Patrick Califia, Gayle Rubin, and sixteen others co-founded Samois, a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983 and was the first lesbian BDSM group in the United States. (More under &quot;Lesbian&quot; below) In recent decades the leather community has been considered a subset of BDSM culture rather than a descendant of that culture. Even so, the most visibly organized SM community related to leather has been a subculture of leather, as evidenced by the American competition known as International Mr. Leather (established 1979), and SM in the UK (established 1981). International Ms. Leather was first held in 1987, with the first winner being Judy Tallwing McCarthey, a lesbian.

In 1979 the newly formed San Francisco lesbian motorcycle club, Dykes on Bikes, led what was then called the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade for the first time and has done so ever since (since 1994, the event has been called the San Francisco Pride Parade).

Leather and Lace, a woman&#x27;s leather/BDSM support and social group, was founded in Los Angeles in 1980. The women of Leather and Lace learned the &quot;old guard&quot; traditions from the men of Avatar. Leather and Lace had a code of conduct and a uniform that could only be worn once a member earned the right. In New York, there was LSM. Only members of the club were allowed to know that LSM stood for Lesbian Sex Mafia.

By the mid-1980s, lesbian motorcycle enthusiasts in other cities besides San Francisco began to form motorcycle clubs.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, lesbian leatherwomen were often involved in helping to care for gay leathermen who had been stricken with AIDS.

===Deaf people===
In 1986, Baltimore Leather Association of the Deaf (BLADeaf), the first deaf leather club in America, was founded. Its original name was Maryland Lambda Alliance of the Deaf and it had three name changes before its name was changed to BLADeaf. It was founded by Elwood C. Bennett, Scott Wilson, and Harry &quot;Abbe&quot; Woosley Jr. According to BLADeaf, the fact of the Baltimore Eagle being BLADeaf&#x27;s home bar means the Baltimore Eagle is the world&#x27;s first bar to home a deaf leather organization.

In 1989, a deaf chapter of the National Leather Association called “NLA: Deaf Chapter”, which eventually became International Deaf Leather, was founded by Michael Felts, Philip Rubin, Bob Donaldson, Rolf Hagton, Jim Dunne, Bobby Andrascik and Charles Wilkinson. International Deaf Leather held contests for the titles International Ms. Deaf Leather, International Mr. Deaf Leather, and International Deaf Leather Boy. International Deaf Leather also bestowed the Michael Felts Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 1997 was given to Baltimore Leather Association of the Deaf (BLADeaf) cofounder Harry “Abbé” Woosley Jr., and the International Deaf Leather Recognition Award, which in 1998 was given to Baltimore Leather Association of the Deaf (BLADeaf). International Deaf Leather ended in 2021.

Deaf leathermen have continued to compete at IML; in 1992, IML featured three deaf contestants.

=== Bootblacks ===
With the establishment of local, regional and international bootblack contests in the 1990s and early 2000s, bootblacks began to gain visibility as a subculture in their own right. Nowadays, bootblack stands as well as classes on bootblacking are common fixtures at events, contests, conferences and parties. Bootblacking is rooted in service to the leather community and the care of the gear Leatherpeople use, such as leather jackets, vests, boots, chaps, harnesses, or items made from rubber, neoprene or other materials. They are not only preserving the physical items (many of which have been gifted, earned or inherited) but are also collecting the stories of their wearers. Therefore, bootblacks play a central role in the oral history of the leather scene.

===Various age groups===

In the United States, men&#x27;s leather culture has been associated with men above the age of 40, but recent years have seen growing numbers of younger leather men. Also, in much of the rest of the world, including Europe and Australia, there is a merging of the established older leather community with young leathermen and leatherwomen and kink/fetish/gear communities. In Europe, younger men have combined the aesthetic and exploration of sexual power with the gay skinhead movement and social-fraternal organizations like BLUF, from the late 1970s.

== Leather Pride Flag ==
The leather pride flag was designed by Tony DeBlase, who first presented it at International Mr. Leather in Chicago, Illinois on May 28, 1989. DeBlase considered the flag to be a first draft and expected the community would suggest changes to the design. While some community members wanted a say in the final design, the majority embraced DeBlase&#x27;s original design as-is. To this day, the flag has not undergone any significant revisions.

In June 1989 the flag was used by the leather contingent in a Portland, Oregon pride parade, which was its first appearance at a pride parade.

== Art ==
Artists and photographers have played a crucial role in the leather scene. In the early days, they created works that gave the emerging subculture a face and visualized taboo sexual fantasies, whether in the form of murals in bars and clubs, drawings and photo spreads in magazines (e.g. Drummer magazine) or comics, and made a decisive contribution to its dissemination.

In oral histories, for example, the works of Tom of Finland are repeatedly described as influential for one&#x27;s own sexual biography. Many men identified with his characters, who were pictured as mansculine and virile, thus defeating homophobic stereotypes of effeminacy. Tom&#x27;s drawings were central to the development and dissemination of a more unified gay leather aesthetic, resulting in the so-called &quot;clone look&quot; of the 1970s and 1980s.

Many artists who play a major cultural role in the leather scene are usually hardly known beyond this due to the erotic and pornographic content of their works. Exceptions are the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and the illustrator Tom of Finland. The Tom of Finland Foundation (ToFF), which was founded in 1984, aims to promote erotic art and support erotic artists through scholarship programs.

Influential artists of the leather scene include:

* Tom of Finland
* Dom Orejudos
* Robert Mapplethorpe
* Chuck Arnett

== Organizations ==
The leather scene has thrived on its organizations and clubs, from informal networks in the 1940s and motorcycle clubs in the 1950s and 1960s to today&#x27;s organizations focused on information and education.

Particularly in the early days, motorcycle clubs were central social hubs, which not only provided a community for like-minded men, but also inconspicuous covers for the first BDSM associations. Pioneering motorcycle clubs formed in Los Angeles, namely the Satyrs Motorcycle Club (1954) and Oedipus Motorcycle Club in Los Angeles, which split from the Satyrs in 1958. Early San Francisco clubs included the Warlocks (1960) and the California Motor Club.

In Chicago, the first club was Second City Motorcycle Club (1965), with Chuck Renslow as its first president. It built the foundation for Chicago Hellfire Club (1971), which had the express purpose of facilitating BDSM sex and has been sponsoring Inferno since 1976. 

In New York City gay motorcycle clubs developed later than in California: Empire City MC (1964) was the first gay motorcycle club in New York, followed by the New York Motorbike Club (1967) and Cycle MC (1968).

In Europe, the first Leather Club was the Sixty Nine Club (1965) in London, other early European leather clubs include Senses (1969) in UK, MS Amsterdam (1970) and MSC Rhein-Main Frankfurt  (1970),  Loge 70 (1973) in Switzerland, MSC London (1973) and MS Belgica (c. 1974) in Brussels. The European Confederation of Motorcycle Club (ECMC) was founded as first confederation of kink and leather clubs in Europe in 1974, with leatherman Felix Jones being an important figure in that development.

Early clubs in Sydney included the South Pacific Motor Club (SPMC).

In 1979 the first lesbian motorcycle club Dykes on Bikes was formed in San Francisco. It has been leading the San Francisco Pride Parade since its establishment. By the mid-1980s, lesbian motorcycle enthusiasts in other cities besides San Francisco began to form motorcycle clubs.

Over time more clubs were founded that were explicitly linked to leather and BDSM. These include Samois (1978–83) in San Francisco as the first lesbian BDSM organization in the US, Chicago Hellfire Club (1971), 15 Association in San Francisco, Eulenspiegel Society in New York and the Society of Janus in Chicago.

The Gay Male S/M Activists (GMSMA, 1981–2009) and the Lesbian Sex Mafia (LSM) were founded in 1981 in New York City. Both were committed to open enrollment, as well as a focus on education for newcomers. The principle of &quot;safe, sane, consensual&quot; (SSC) stems from GMSMA&#x27;s environment.

There are leather clubs that are particularly committed to improving the rights of different marginalized groups within the leather scene through advocacy work and community building. The best known and most established is Onyx, which was founded 1995 for and by gay and bisexual BIPOC men. More recently, Proteus Leather Club was founded in Europe for and by trans and non-binary people in leather.

==Locations==
===Bars, sex clubs and urban districts===

Bars and clubs played a key role in the development of the gay leather scene, providing a gathering space for the community and a point of entry into the scene for newcomers, as well as turning leather into a consumable aesthetic and identity, often enforced by dress codes. They are considered the first distinct subgenre of gay bars, and with their characteristic visuals are often depicted as gay bars&#x27; most iconic form. Designated leather bars started appearing between the 1950s and 1960s in major cities, exploding in popularity in the 1970s. Usually, leather bars were found in industrial and working-class city neighborhoods, like South of Market in San Francisco and the Manhattan Meatpacking District.

Many major cities around the world had or have leather bars and clubs, and in some cases a concentration of these associated a particular district with the leather scene, with the most well known being the &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; on Folsom Street in San Francisco.

Dozens of leather bars are named &quot;Eagle&quot; or some variant thereof; although they are independently owned, these Eagle bars share a focus on leather, kink, and masculinity.

Leather districts include:
* Amsterdam: the Cockring (now closed) and Eagle bars and Warmoesstraat street — noting the closing of most of the leather bars once here, newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot; stated in 2015 that &quot;the darkroom has been consigned to history because of Grindr&quot;. On Warmoesstraat, the first leather bar in the country opened around 1955. 
* Berlin: Scheune (bar), Tom&#x27;s Bar, both on Motzstraße, New Action on Kleiststraße and the area around Nollendorfplatz
* Chicago: The Gold Coast, GayLife newspaper, Man&#x27;s Country bathhouse and the Chicago Eagle all were located on a street block of Clark Street (from Ainslie to Winnemac).
* New York City: the sexclubs Mineshaft (1976–85) and Anvil (1974–85) in the Meatpacking District.
* San Francisco: the LGBTQ and Leather Cultural District covers the area which traditionally has had a concentration of leather bars and clubs, among others Fe-Be&#x27;s, SF Eagle, The Stud, The Ramrod and the In Between.
*Mexico City: in the gay-friendly Condesa neighbourhood, Tom&#x27;s Leather Bar serves special nights for the Mexican leather community since 1995.
=== Museums, archives and libraries ===
Many LGBT museums, archives and libraries collect material relating to leather communities, with many holding substantial collections, including the Australian Queer Archives in Melbourne and the Leather Archives &amp; Museum in Chicago.

In 1991 Chuck Renslow and Tony DeBlase founded the Leather Archives &amp; Museum “as a community archives, library, and museum of Leather, kink, fetish, and BDSM history and culture.” Renslow and DeBlase founded the museum in response to the AIDS crisis, during which the leather community&#x27;s history and belongings were frequently lost or intentionally suppressed and discarded.

 In 2005 Viola Johnson started The Carter-Johnson Leather Library, &quot;a non-profit [501(c)(3) pending] organization that consists of a traveling collection of thousands of books, magazines, posters, art, club and event pins, newspapers, event programs and ephemera showing leather, fetish, S/M erotic history.&quot;

=== Official recognition ===
The LGBTQ and Leather Cultural District was created in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood of San Francisco in 2018. It includes the San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, with four works of art, which opened in 2017:
the four works of art are: A black granite stone etched with a narrative by Gayle Rubin, an image of the &quot;Leather David&quot; statue by Mike Caffee, a reproduction of Chuck Arnett&#x27;s 1962 mural that was in the Tool Box (a gay leather bar), engraved standing stones that honor community leather institutions (one being the Folsom Street Fair), leather pride flag pavement markings through which the stones emerge, and bronze bootprints along the curb which honor 28 people who were an important part of the leather communities of San Francisco.

On May 25, 2018, the Chicago City Council voted to designate a stretch of Clark Street in Uptown (between Winnemac Ave and Ainslie Ave) as &quot;CHUCK RENSLOW WAY.&quot; Renslow founded numerous leather and LGBT institutions, many of which were once located on Clark St, including the Gold Coast bar and Man&#x27;s Country bathhouse. The city unveiled the new street sign during the anniversary of the International Mr. Leather competition that Renslow founded.

== Events ==
The Folsom Street Fair, begun in 1984, is an annual BDSM and leather subculture street fair held in September, that caps San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Leather Pride Week&quot;. The Folsom Street Fair, sometimes simply referred to as &quot;Folsom&quot;, takes place on Folsom Street between 8th and 13th Streets, in San Francisco&#x27;s South of Market district. The event is California&#x27;s third-largest single-day, outdoor spectator event and the world&#x27;s largest leather event and showcase for BDSM products and culture. Folsom Street Events now organizes many events each year including Folsom Europe.

Other large events include Easter Berlin (the largest leather event in Europe), International Mr. Leather and Mister Leather Europe, and Amsterdam Leather Pride (see Wikipedia article in Dutch).

=== Competitions ===
Many leather bars and organizations hold annual pageant competitions, some of which serve as feeder competitions for larger regional, national, or international competitions such as International Mr. Leather and Mister Leather Europe. The following table includes a non-exhaustive list of past and present leather competitions:


== Representation in popular culture ==
The film &quot;Cruising&quot; (1980), directed by William Friedkin and starring Al Pacino, represents a paradigm shift in the treatment of gay sexuality in Hollywood. It is based on the novel &quot;Cruising&quot; (1970) by Gerald Walker and explores the world of men&#x27;s leather subculture within the context of a murder mystery. It aimed to bring aspects of the men&#x27;s leather subculture to a wider audience, showcasing different elements and practices associated with the community. At the same time, it provided outrageous insights into gay leather sexuality to satisfy curiosity of the heterosexual mainstream society. Homosexual desire and violence were presented as two sides of the same coin. Some scenes are set at the Mineshaft (although filming took place in the Hellfire Club), with extras recruited from the Mineshaft&#x27;s patrons. Among other things, the movie features a fisting scene. The filming in 1979 massively hindered by protests from the gay community.

A band associated with leather culture is Village People, which began in 1977. According to Jack Fritscher, Jacques Morali drew his inspiration for the four characters of Village People from the gay BDSM leather bar and sex club the Mineshaft&#x27;s dress code. Glenn Hughes, the original leather biker of the group, frequently attended there. He sported an extravagant horseshoe moustache and wore his trademark leather outfit on and off stage. As he was the band&#x27;s &quot;biker&quot; and a real-life fanatic, he kept his motorcycle parked inside his home. Eric Anzalone was the Leatherman/Biker of Village People from 1995 to 2017, replacing original member Glenn. However, Glenn continued with management of the band. During his later years, he was known for storming the streets of New York City with his custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Glenn, who was also referred to by the masses as &quot;Leatherman&quot;, was named on People Magazine&#x27;s 1979 list of most beautiful people.

Distinct aspects of heavy metal fashion can be credited to various bands, but the band that takes the most credit for revolutionizing the look is Judas Priest, primarily with its singer, Rob Halford, who openly identifies as gay and wears black leather. Halford wore a leather costume on stage as early as 1978 to coincide with the promotion for the &quot;Killing Machine&quot; (&quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; in the United States) album. In a 1998 interview, Halford described the leather subculture as the inspiration for this look. Shortly after appropriating the leather look, Halford started appearing onstage on a roaring motor bike. Soon, the rest of the band followed.

In the late 1970s, many fans of Judas Priest, AC/DC and Meat Loaf began imitating the clothing of leathermen due to the association of such fashions with toughness. Typical heavy metal fashions in the UK, US and Australia included leather battle jackets, combat boots, studded belts, and black leather jackets like the Schott Perfecto.

Freddie Mercury of Queen began incorporating leather into his stage costumes during the band&#x27;s 1978 News of the World Tour. By their 1979 Jazz Tour, Mercury was wearing a full leather outfit, which he explained was inspired by clubs he frequented. Leather jackets, trousers, and accessories would feature prominently in his wardrobe for the rest of his touring career.

Joan Jett has a leather pride sticker prominently displayed on her guitar.

The satirical mystery novel The Killer wore Leather (2013) by Laura Antoniou is about the murder of a leather titleholder during an international leather convention (fictional event based on IML).

<text>Thai New Year or [[Songkran]] (, ), also known as Songkran Festival, Songkran Splendours, is the Thai New Year&#x27;s national holiday. Songkran is on 13 April every year, but the holiday period extends from 14 to 15 April. In 2018 the Thai cabinet extended the festival nationwide to seven days, 9–16 April, to enable citizens to travel home for the holiday. In 2019, the holiday was observed 9–16 April as 13 April fell on a Saturday. In 2024, Songkran was extended to almost the entire month, starting on the first of April, and ending on the twenty-first, departing from the traditional 3-day format. And with the New Year of many calendars of Southeast and South Asia, in keeping with the Theravada Buddhist calendar and also coincides with New Year in Hindu calendar such as Vishu, Bihu, Pohela Boishakh, Pana Sankranti, Vaisakhi. The New Year takes place at around the same time as the new year celebrations of many regions of South Asia like China (Dai people of Yunnan Province), India, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

In Siam, New Year is now officially celebrated 1 January. Songkran was the official New Year until 1888, when it was switched to a fixed date of 1 April. Then in 1940, this date was shifted to 1 January. The traditional Thai New Year Songkran was transformed into a national holiday. Celebrations are famous for the public water fights framed as ritual cleansing. This had become quite popular among Thai and foreigners.

==Meaning==

&quot;Songkran&quot; is a Thai word, derived from Sanskrit संक्रान्ति saṅkrānti meaning &#x27;to move&#x27;, &#x27;movement&#x27;, &#x27;the passing of&#x27; or &#x27;astrological passage&#x27;. It derives from the movement of the sun from one position to another in the zodiac. According to its literal meaning in Sanskrit, a Songkran occurs every month. However, the period that Thai people refer to as Songkran happens when the sun moves from Pisces to Aries in the zodiac. The correct name for this period should actually be &quot;Maha Songkran&quot; (&#x27;great Songkran) because it coincides with the arrival of a New Year. The Songkran festival is, therefore, a celebration of the New Year in accordance with the solar calendar. The celebration covers a period of three days: 13 April is regarded as &quot;Maha Songkran&quot;, the day that the sun moves into Aries on the zodiac or the last day of the old year. The next day, 14 April is called &quot;Wan Nao&quot;, the transitional day between the old and the new years, and 15 April is called &quot;Wan Thaloeng Sok&quot; ( &#x27;to begin a new era or year&#x27;), New Year&#x27;s day itself.

== Computation ==
In 1989, the Thai cabinet fixed Songkran at 12–14 April, despite the correct starting date (13 April at 20:57). Songkran, however, was traditionally computed according to the method described in &quot;Suriyayart&quot; (), the Thai version of Surya Siddhanta. The celebration starts when the sun enters Aries according to the sidereal zodiac system. This is called &quot;Maha Songkran&quot; day (). The final day marks the new solar year and is called &quot;Wan Thaloengsok&quot; (). The astrologers, local or royal, then make predictions about the economy, agriculture, rainfall, and political affairs according to observations between both days. The king, or Chief Royal Astrologer on the monarch&#x27;s behalf, issued an official notification on the new year to the public. The announcement, called &quot;Prakat Songkran&quot; (, Songkran notification), contained the information on &quot;Maha Songkran&quot;, &quot;Thaloengsok&quot;, the calendar, and religious and royal ceremonies. The government strictly adhered to the announcement and arranged some ceremonies according to the computation made by the royal astrologer.

According to the scripture, 800 years equal 292,207 days. In other words, each solar year lasts 292,207 &quot;kammaja&quot; (, lit. one produced by karma), where 1 &quot;kammaja&quot; equals 108 seconds and 800 &quot;kammaja&quot; corresponds to 1 solar day. Timekeeping began as &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; started in 3102 BCE (−3101 CE). At the start of each year, it is possible to compute the number of days since &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; commenced using the following formula:

:formula_1

where formula_2, formula_3, formula_4 denote &quot;Kali&quot; Era, Common Era, and Buddhist Era respectively. formula_5 is the &quot;Suriyayart&quot; day number, which can vary according to the calendar era being used. The integer result is the count of days at New Year&#x27;s Day, while the remainder indicates the time at which the new year begins (in &quot;kammaja&quot;), measured from the previous midnight.

Owing to a huge day number in the calculation, new calendar eras were devised to solve this problem, including the Minor Era (ME). 0 ME corresponds to 1181 BE, 638 CE or 3739 KE. Following the above equation, it follows that there were 1,365,702 days since the start of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot;. The remainder of the division suggests that the new year started at 373 &quot;kammaja&quot; after the previous midnight. This corresponds to 373/800 of a day or 11 hours, 11 minutes, and 24 seconds. In other words, 0 ME started at 11:11:24 on Sunday, 25 March 638 CE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The Julian day at the new year is computed according to the following formula:

:formula_6

The number can then be converted back into a date using an algorithm (see Julian day). &quot;Maha Songkran&quot; day is computed either by a lengthy process or by subtracting formula_7 by 2.165 days (2 days 3 hours 57 minutes 36 seconds). This can be rewritten as

:formula_8

A solar year lasts 292,207 &quot;kammaja&quot; or 365.25875 days every year. However, a Gregorian year lasts, on average, 292194 &quot;kammaja&quot;. The difference of 13 &quot;kammaja&quot; (23 minutes, 24 seconds) accumulates every year, causing the shift of Songkran towards the end of the calendar year. In 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000, Maha Songkran was on 7 April 9 April, 10 April 12 and 13 April respectively.

Nowadays the royal palace has ceased to issue the &quot;Prakat Songkran&quot;, replacing it with a small calendar booklet given to the public on New Year&#x27;s Day. Government Savings Bank still prints a one-page lunisolar calendar, which is different from the multiple-page solar calendar commonly seen. The calendar features the image of &quot;Nang Songkran&quot; with her vehicle and subordinates, led by a Chinese zodiac animal holding a flag with Thai script for that zodiac. It also contains a piece of comprehensive information on the correct Songkran day and religious days. Some astrologers, especially in northern Thailand, still issue their own Songkran notification containing predictions and other information. In 2013, the Chiang Mai Provincial Council decided to defy the government-set holiday by rescheduling the ceremony according to the correct calculation.

The following table lists the start and end dates of Songkran festival obtained from the formulae discussed above. The Chinese zodiac for each year is also given since it is also used in Thai astrology. However, the Chinese zodiac in Chinese astrology changes on &quot;Lichun&quot;, just before the Chinese New Year, in February, while Thai astrology uses the first day of fifth lunar month (roughly the new moon in late–March to early–April). Before the cut off date, astrologer uses the zodiac of the last year.


== Origin and myths ==
The origin of songkran festival lies in a Buddhist folk myth or non canonical jataka related to harvest and spring. In prosperous city of Sukhavati in suvannabhumi, Bodistva was born in the household of a poor farmer. Once upon a time, Indra the king of Devas, looked at the city from heaven, and felt sad seeing the high level of corruption. He found that people did not respect their elders, behaved rudely, and didn&#x27;t serve them proper food and medicines. They had no compassion to the needy and helpless. No faith in Sila and Uposath but fun in sins, no faith in donation but greedy for wealth, no faith in Dhamma but made business of Dhamma. By seeing decline of Dhamma, he said, &quot;Glory/Siri of humans lies in their faith in Dhamma. There is no Glory without Dhamma.&quot; With affirmation of this truth, people in the city immediately lost their glory, no proper rains, water and food scarcity prevailed, extreme drought with skin-burning hot sun waves and dirty bad smelling garbage filled their homes.

To get saved from this suffering, In leadership of bodistva, people prayed to mother earth or Siri. They asked Siri the causes and solutions of their misfortune. Out of compassion and sympathy to her children, she told them the causes and solutions to their sufferings. She told them restoration of their faith in Dhamma will end their suffering. She gave them a divine piece of fertile land, divine seeds, mysterious song for rain and pots divine thanaka powder of several colours to apply on their skin to cool body from hot sun waves. Now, people pleaged to observe sila and upasotha under guidance of bodistva.

Bodistva and his companions started cultivating the divine land, sowing divine seeds. They used to apply several colours of thanaka powder and water is poured to cool their body from heavy sun waves. In few days their crops were grown that was the day when the sun entered aries constellation. They produced adequate grains. At the day of harvest, they washed feets of their elders, saluted them and served delicious food and proper cloths. Donations were made to needy and helpless. Hence, Dhamma was restored by the people.

Same day when Indra the king of devas again looked at the city of SuvannaBhumi. He praised them and said, &quot;Glory of humans lies in their faith in Dhamma, there is no Glory without Dhamma.&quot; By affirmation of this truth immediately their lost glory was restored back and the people elected bodistva as their leader and celebrated the harvest day with throwing water on each other and started playing with several colours of thanaka powder by applying it on each other&#x27;s body.

Thus, in Buddhist community in South East Asia, to remember and celebrate this day, people clean their houses, salute and show respect to their elders by washing their feets, serving delicious food and proper clothing to them. Donations are made to monastery and needy. People play with water and different colours of thanaka powder is applied to each other&#x27;s body.

According to the Buddhist scripture of Wat Pho, Songkran originated from the death of Kapila Brahma (). In the olden days, there was a wealthy man and his neighbor, a drunkard. The drunkard, who had two sons, belittled the rich man for being childless. The rich man was humiliated and beseeched the Sun and the Moon gods to grant him a son. His attempts failed until he offered cooked rice to the tree god living in a banyan tree, who asked Indra to grant the man&#x27;s wish. The child, named Thammabal (, also Dhammapala, ), was born.

Thammabal was a clever child who learned three vedas, bird language and also taught people to avoid sin. Kapila Brahma learned of the child and wanted to test the child&#x27;s cleverness. The god asked, &quot;Where is the glory of men (&quot;sri&quot;) located in the morning, during the day, and in the evening?&quot;. The loser would have his head chopped off. The boy thought in vain for six days, but could not find a solution to the riddles. He lay beneath a sugar palm tree and overheard a conversation between a pair of eagles who planned to eat his corpse when he lost the bet. The female eagle asked her mate whether he knew the answer. He answered, &quot;In the morning, the &quot;sri&quot; appears on the face, so people wash their faces every morning. At noon, the &quot;sri&quot; is at the chest where people spray perfume every noon. In the evening, the &quot;sri&quot; goes to the feet, so people wash their feet every evening.&quot; Thmmabal memorized the answer and gave it to Kapila Brahma the next day. Having lost, Kapila Brahma summoned his seven daughters and told them that he must cut his head off. However, if his head fell to earth, it would create an inferno that would engulf the world. If his head was thrown into the air, the rains would stop. And if his head was dropped into the ocean, all seawater would dry up. To prevent these calamities, he told his daughters to place his head on an elevated phan. Thungsa, his eldest child, stored her father&#x27;s head in the cave in Mount Kailash.

Every year when the Sun enters Aries, one of Kapila Brahma&#x27;s children, called the &quot;Nang Songkran&quot; () for that year, and other angels form a procession. One of them takes the phan with Kapila Brahma&#x27;s head. The lady stands, sits, reclines or sleeps on the back of the animal depending on the time. From the dawn to midday, the lady will stand on the back of her conveyance. After midday until the sunset, she will sit down. Between the sunset and midnight, the lady lies down on her vehicle but leaves her eyes open. After midnight, she sleeps. These postures and other details were previously drawn as part of the &quot;Prakat Songkran&quot; and now as part of the lunisolar calendar. The procession lasts for 60 minutes around Mount Meru. This is subsequently called &quot;Maha Songkran&quot; to distinguish from other &quot;Songkran&quot; that occur when the Sun moves from one to another zodiac. For simplicity, the name was later shortened as &quot;Songkran&quot;.

The following table lists the names and characteristics of &quot;Nang Songkran&quot;, which vary according to which day of the week &quot;Maha Songkran&quot; falls on in each year.

== New year traditions ==
In &quot;De Beschryving van Japan&quot; (The History of Japan) handwrote in 1690 by Engelbert Kaempfer in reign of King Phetracha of Ayutthaya Kingdom said of Songkran in old-17th century Dutch :-
In the reign of King Borommakot (1733–58), there was recorded of ancient royal ceremonies of Siamese New Year observance called &quot;Maha Songkran Day&quot;, the tradition-inherited from past generations of King of Ayutthaya Kingdom such ceremonies as, royal forming of sand stupa with royal ornaments, sprinkling the water onto the statues of Buddha and graven images, offering food to monks, procession of sand stupas parade to temples, royal musical fanfares, and also establishing the almshouse assignment subsequently, said in &quot;the Concise Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya Kingdom of royal forming the sand stupa in the reign of King Borommakot&quot;:-

There was a contemporary archive mentioned Songkran festival of Siam in reign of King Mongkut. The archive written in 1854 by Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix, a priest of the Société des Missions Etrangères who was assigned as Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic and lived in Siam. Said in French:-
The Songkran celebration is rich with symbolic traditions. Mornings begin with merit-making. Visiting local temples and offering food to the Buddhist monks is commonly practiced. On this specific occasion, performing water pouring on Buddha statues and the young and elderly is a traditional ritual, representing purification and the washing away of one&#x27;s sins and bad luck. As a festival of unity, people who have moved away usually return home to their loved ones and elders. Paying reverence to ancestors is an important part of Songkran tradition.

The holiday is known for its Water Festival. Major streets are closed to traffic, and are used as arenas for water fights. Celebrants, young and old, participate in this tradition by splashing water on each other. Traditional parades are held and in some venues &quot;Lady Songkran&quot; or &quot;Miss Songkran&quot; is crowned, where contestants are clothed in traditional Thai dress. For the general public, floral shirt or Hawaiian shirt is a popular clothing item worn during this festival.
== In Thailand ==


In 2024, UNESCO certified Songkran as part of humanity&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage list. 

Central Region: people in this region clean their houses when Songkran approaches. All dress up in colorful clothing or Thai dress. After offering food to the monks, people will offer a requiem to their ancestors. People make merit offerings such as giving sand to the temple for construction or repair. Other forms of merit include releasing birds and fish. Nowadays, people also release other kinds of animals such as buffaloes and cows. Phra Pradaeng hosts traditional ceremonies of Mon people such as parades in the colourful traditional outfits and folklore performances.

South: southerners have three Songkran rules: Work as little as possible and avoid spending money; do not hurt other persons or animals; do not tell lies.

North: on 7 April, Baan Had Siew in Si Satchanalai District hosts the&#x27;Elephant Procession Ordination&#x27; event with a colourful parade where men dressed in the traditional clothes are taken to the temples on elephants. In northern Thailand 13 April is celebrated with gunfire or firecrackers to repel bad luck. On the next day, people prepare food and useful things to offer to the monks at the temple. People have to go to temple to make merit and bathe Buddha&#x27;s statue and after that they pour water on the hands of elders and ask for their blessings.

East: the eastern region has activities similar to the other part of Thailand, but people in the east always make merit at the temple throughout all the days of the Songkran Festival and create sand pagodas. Some people, after making merit at the temple, prepare food to be given to the elderly members of their family.

The Capital (Bangkok): the Khao San Road and Silom Road with Siam Square are the hubs for modern celebration of Songkran. The roads are closed for traffic, and posts equipped with water guns and buckets full of water. The party runs day and night.

== Elsewhere ==

Songkran is celebrated by the Malaysian Siamese community, particularly in the states of Kedah, Kelantan, Penang, Perak, Perlis and Terengganu where most Siamese are located.

Pana Sankranti (Odia: ପଣା ସଂକ୍ରାନ୍ତି), also known as Maha bisuba Sankranti, is the traditional new year day festival of Buddhists and Hindus in Odisha, India.

The festival is celebrated as Sangken in northeastern areas of India and as Bizu, Boisuk, Shangrai, and Boisabi in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh, which is the traditional New Year&#x27;s Day by the indigenous Hindu people and Buddhist community. The Sangken festival is celebrated by the Tai people — Khamti people Khamyang, Phake and Turung people. The festival is also celebrated by Singpho, Tikhak (Tangsa) and Duoniya people. Sangken generally falls in the month of &#x27;Naun Ha&#x27;, the fifth month of the year of the Tai Lunar calendar coinciding with the month of April. It is celebrated in the last days of the old year and the lunar new year begins on the day just after the end of the festival.

Vishu, a Hindu religious festival, celebrated mainly in the South Indian State of Kerala (and some parts of Tamil Nadu), also falls during the same timeframe. It is predominantly a harvest festival.

In some villages in south India, especially Karnataka, a festival called &quot;Okhali&quot; or &quot;Okhli&quot; is celebrated in which every household keeps a barrel of water mixed with chalk and turmeric to throw on passers-by. The date of Okhali coincides with that of Songkran in Thailand and Thingyan in Myanmar, not with the dates of Holi, which is a north Indian festival.

In Japan, Songkran festival observance held along with the Hot Spring festival, &quot;Beppu Hatto Onsen Matsuri&quot;, in Beppu city, Ōita Prefecture, called &quot;Beppu Songkran Festival&quot;, not only water-splashing observance but also Thai cultural fanfares occurred, and also held at the world&#x27;s wettest music festival, &quot;S2O Japan Songkran Music Festival&quot;. It&#x27;s combination of Thai-Japan culture and depiction of long time relation of each other.

Songkran is celebrated annually on the U.S. territory of Wake Island by Air Force members and American and Thai contractors, including New York State for commemorating the Asian American community&#x27;s celebration of Songkran on April as an important cultural event on the state according to Assembly Resolution No. 1059.

== In other calendars ==
Songkran occurs at the same time as that given by Bede for festivals of Ēostre—and Easter weekend occasionally coincides with Songkran (most recently 1979, 1990, and 2001, but not again until 2063).

== Controversies ==
=== Roadway fatalities ===

Police statistics show that the death toll from road accidents doubles during the annual Songkran holiday. Between 2009 and 2013 there were about 27 road deaths per day during non-holiday periods and an average of 52 road deaths per day during Songkran. Thailand has among the highest traffic fatality rates in the world, along with Liberia, Congo, and Tanzania. Approximately 70–80 percent of the accidents that occur during the long holiday period are motorcycle accidents. About 10,000 people per year die in motorcycle accidents.

The National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) says a total of 110,909 people were arrested and 5,772 vehicles impounded at road safety checkpoints across the country between 9–16 April 2016. In 2018 the number of offenders arrested at 2,029 checkpoints had risen to 146,589. Of these, 39,572 had failed to wear crash helmets and 37,779 carried no driving licence. Reacting to the numbers, the prime minister &quot;ordered stricter enforcement of the law&quot;; the interior minister said he would &quot;propose greater efforts in raising awareness as an additional measure, insisting that traffic laws were [already] strictly enforced&quot;; and deputy prime minister Prawit Wongsuwan said he would &quot;work harder to ensure motorcyclists wore helmets&quot;.

This period is known locally as &quot;7 dangerous days&quot;.

===Arrests===
* Police arrested a British tourist in Chiang Mai on the first day of the 2016 Songkran holiday, 13 April, for violating the junta&#x27;s ban on indecent dress. In a water fight the culprit was topless, wearing only short pants, but no shirt. He was taken into custody, fined 100 baht, then released. Temperatures in Chiang Mai reached 41 °C that day.
* A man was arrested during Songkran 2016 for posting a video of a topless woman dancing during the 2015 Songkran festival. Police said Jakkrapatsorn Akkarapokanan, 29, was charged under the Computer Crime Act for posting the year-old video of a woman rolling up her wet shirt to let revelers touch her breasts. Jakkrapatsorn was released on a 100,000 baht bond. Police said they attempted to find the topless woman in the video to fine her 500 baht for indecency, but the one year statute of limitations had expired.

===Intellectual property===
==== Celebrate Singapore ====
In 2014, &quot;Celebrate Singapore,&quot; a large two-day Songkran-style water festival, was planned for Singapore and the event was promoted as the &quot;largest water festival party in Singapore.&quot; However, controversy emerged when the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) Deputy Governor for Tourism Products, Vilaiwan Twichasri, claimed that Thailand holds exclusive rights to celebrate Songkran and planned to consult with officials at the Department of Intellectual Property, Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Culture to discuss a potential lawsuit. The Deputy Governor&#x27;s view was supported by numerous Thai citizens on social media websites. Chai Nakhonchai, Cultural Promotion Department chief, pointed out that Songkran is a traditional festival shared by many countries throughout Southeast Asia, while historian Charnvit Kasetsiri stated that no single nation can claim ownership of a tradition. On 25 March 2014, the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; reported that the Singaporean government had intervened in the festival&#x27;s content and there would be no water-throwing, no water pistols and no public drinking. The festival was also reduced to a one-day event.
