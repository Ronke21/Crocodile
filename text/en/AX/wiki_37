<text>Cheap Trick is an American rock band formed in Rockford, Illinois in 1973 by guitarist Rick Nielsen, bassist Tom Petersson, lead vocalist Robin Zander and drummer Bun E. Carlos. Their work bridged elements of &#x27;60s guitar pop, &#x27;70s hard rock, and the emerging punk rock sound, and would help set the template for subsequent power pop artists.

Cheap Trick released their self-titled debut album in 1977 and, later that year, found success in Japan with the release of their second album, &quot;In Color&quot;. 1978&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot; included the power pop classic &quot;Surrender&quot;. The band achieved mainstream popularity in the United States in 1979 with the triple-platinum live album &quot;At Budokan&quot; and a Top 10 single, a live recording of &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;. They followed with &quot;Dream Police&quot; (1979), their most commercially successful studio album, reaching No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. After struggling with declining popularity and lineup changes in the 1980s, Cheap Trick experienced a major resurgence toward the end of the decade when they topped the US charts with the power ballad &quot;The Flame&quot;.

The band has continued releasing new music into the 21st century and maintains a constant touring schedule, having performed live more than 5,000 times since their formation. Cheap Trick have sold more than 20 million albums and built a dedicated cult following. Their influence has been cited by a diverse range of rock artists from both the mainstream and underground. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016. The current lineup of the band consists of Zander, Nielsen and Petersson.

==History==
===Origins and early years (1969–1977)===
In 1967, Rick Nielsen formed Fuse with Tom Peterson (later known as Tom Petersson), who had played in another Rockford, Illinois, band called the Bo Weevils. With Bun E. Carlos joining on drums, Fuse moved to Philadelphia in 1971. From 1972 to 1973, they called themselves Sick Man of Europe. After a European tour in 1973, Nielsen and Petersson returned to Rockford and reunited with Carlos. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the band adopted the name Cheap Trick on August 15, 1973. The name was inspired by the band&#x27;s attendance at a Slade concert, where Petersson commented that Slade used &quot;every cheap trick in the book&quot; as part of their act.

Randy &quot;Xeno&quot; Hogan was the original lead singer for Cheap Trick. He left the band shortly after its formation and was replaced by Robin Zander.

With Robin Zander on vocals, the band recorded a demo in 1975 and played in warehouses, bowling alleys, and various other venues around the midwestern United States. The band was signed to Epic Records in early 1976. The band released its first album, &quot;Cheap Trick&quot;, in early 1977. While favored by critics, the album did not sell well. The album&#x27;s lone single, &quot;Oh, Candy&quot;, failed to chart, as did the album. Their second album, &quot;In Color&quot;, was released later that year. The singles &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot; and &quot;Southern Girls&quot; failed to chart. &quot;In Color&quot; was ranked No. 443 on the 2012 edition of Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

===Budokan brings success (1978–1980)===
When Cheap Trick toured in Japan for the first time in April 1978, they were received with a frenzy reminiscent of Beatlemania. During the tour, Cheap Trick recorded two concerts at the Nippon Budokan. Ten tracks taken from both shows were compiled and released as a live album titled &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot;, which was intended to be exclusive to Japan.

The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot; was released in May 1978. The lead-off track &quot;Surrender&quot; was Cheap Trick&#x27;s first single to chart in the United States, peaking at No. 62. It has gone on to become one of the band&#x27;s signature songs.

Demand for &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; became so great that Epic Records finally released the album in the U.S. in February 1979. &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot; launched the band into international stardom, and the album went triple platinum in the United States. The first single from the album was the live version of &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;, which had originally been released on &quot;In Color&quot;. It reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and became Cheap Trick&#x27;s best-selling single to date. The second single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;, peaked at No. 35. &quot;Need Your Love&quot; had already been recorded for the forthcoming &quot;Dream Police&quot; album that had already been finished, but after the unprecedented success of &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot;, Epic postponed the album&#x27;s release.

&quot;Dream Police&quot; was released later in 1979, and was their third album in a row produced by Tom Werman. The title track of the album was a hit single, as was &quot;Voices&quot;. &quot;Dream Police&quot; also found the band taking its style in a more experimental direction by incorporating strings and dabbling in heavy metal on tracks like &quot;Gonna Raise Hell&quot;. By 1980, Cheap Trick was headlining arenas.

On August 26, 1980, Petersson left the group to record a solo album with his wife Dagmar, using the band name Another Language. Jon Brant became Petersson&#x27;s steady replacement, after a year of Cheap Trick touring and recording with Pete Comita.

&quot;All Shook Up&quot; (1980), produced by former Beatles producer George Martin, reached No. 24 on the charts and was certified gold. However, the album&#x27;s high-class background did not save it from descriptions like &quot;Led Zeppelin gone psycho&quot;.

===1980s struggles (1981–1986)===
In July 1981, CBS Inc. sued Cheap Trick and their manager Ken Adamany for $10 million, alleging they were attempting to coerce CBS into re-negotiating their contract and had refused to record any new material for the label since October 1980. The lawsuit was settled in early 1982 and work commenced on the next album: &quot;One on One&quot;. The album spawned two minor hits with the power ballad &quot;If You Want My Love&quot; (which peaked at no. 45) and the innuendo-laced rocker &quot;She&#x27;s Tight&quot; (which peaked at no. 65).

Cheap Trick released &quot;Next Position Please&quot; in 1983. The album&#x27;s two singles, &quot;Dancing the Night Away&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Take It,&quot; failed to chart. In the same year, Cheap Trick performed two songs for the soundtrack of the adult animated film &quot;Rock &amp; Rule&quot;, which became a cult classic.

In 1984, the band recorded the title track to the Tim Matheson comedy &quot;Up The Creek&quot;, which Nielsen later called &quot;one of the worst&quot; songs he&#x27;d ever written.

The band released &quot;Standing on the Edge&quot; in 1985. This album was called their &quot;best collection of bubblegum bazooka rock in years&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Tonight It&#x27;s You&quot;, reached No. 8 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Rock Tracks chart.

In 1986, the band recorded &quot;Mighty Wings&quot;, the end-title cut for the film &quot;Top Gun&quot;. They then released &quot;The Doctor&quot; in the fall. The album&#x27;s lone single, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot;, failed to chart. The music video for &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot; made history as the first music video to use captioning for hearing-impaired persons. &quot;The Doctor&quot; turned out to be the band&#x27;s final album with Jon Brant as bassist.

===Popular resurgence (1987–1989)===
Petersson rejoined the group in 1987 and helped record 1988&#x27;s &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot;, produced by Richie Zito. Due to the band&#x27;s commercial decline, Epic Records insisted that the band collaborate with professional songwriters on the album. Nielsen said, &quot;&quot;Lap of Luxury&quot; was a tough record to make. We could lie to you and tell you it was all wonderful and great. It wasn&#x27;t. It was tough working with other writers. But it was a lesson for us.&quot;

&quot;The Flame&quot;, a ballad, was issued as the first single from the album, and became the band&#x27;s first-ever No. 1 hit. The second single, a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, peaked at no. 4. This song also reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 list in 1988. The other singles from the album were &quot;Ghost Town&quot;, &quot;Never Had a Lot to Lose&quot;, and &quot;Let Go&quot;; &quot;Ghost Town&quot; and &quot;Never Had a Lot to Lose&quot; also charted. &quot;Lap of Luxury&quot; went platinum and became recognized as the band&#x27;s comeback album. &quot;Billboard&quot; commented: &quot;After a long hitless streak, Cheap Trick brings it all back home. This is the quartet&#x27;s punchiest effort since its mid-&#x27;70s heyday.&quot;

===Transitions (1990–2015)===
&quot;Busted&quot; was released in 1990. The band was allowed more creative control, and professional songwriters were only used on a handful of songs. The first single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Falling Into Love&quot;, reached on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and on the Album Rock Tracks chart. The second single, the Diane Warren-penned &quot;Wherever Would I Be&quot;, reached on the charts. The single &quot;If You Need Me&quot; was not successful, although the track &quot;Back &#x27;n Blue&quot; reached on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart.

In 1991, Cheap Trick&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot; was released.

The group left Epic after the disappointing sales of &quot;Busted&quot; to sign with Warner Bros. Records. In 1994, the band released &quot;Woke Up with a Monster&quot;. The album&#x27;s title track was issued as the first single and reached No. 16 on the US Mainstream Rock charts. The album&#x27;s sales were poor, and it peaked at only No. 123.

In 1997, Cheap Trick signed with indie label Red Ant Records and released &quot;Cheap Trick&quot;. The band attempted to re-introduce themselves to a new generation, as the album was self-titled and the artwork was similar to their first album which had been released twenty years before. The album was critically acclaimed and hailed as a return to form. Eleven weeks after the release, Red Ant&#x27;s parent company Alliance Entertainment Corporation declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The single &quot;Say Goodbye&quot; only reached No. 119 on the charts, and the band again found themselves without a record label. Two other singles were released from the album, &quot;Baby No More&quot; and &quot;Carnival Game&quot;.

Cheap Trick began to rebuild in 1998. The band toured behind the release of &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan: The Complete Concert&quot;, and the remastered re-issues of the band&#x27;s first three albums. One of the multi-night stands from this tour resulted in &quot;Music for Hangovers&quot;, a live album that featured members of the Smashing Pumpkins on two tracks. In 1999, the band recorded a cover of Big Star&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;In the Street&quot; that was used as the theme song for the Fox sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. Cheap Trick ended the song with the lyric &quot;We&#x27;re all all right,&quot; which was drawn from their own 1978 song &quot;Surrender&quot;.
After spending much of 2001 writing songs and about six weeks in pre-production, Cheap Trick went into Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, in March 2002, where they recorded their first studio album in six years, &quot;Special One&quot; in May 2003.

Cheap Trick released &quot;Rockford&quot; on Cheap Trick Unlimited/Big3 Records in 2006. The first single from the album was &quot;Perfect Stranger&quot; (produced by Linda Perry and co-written by Cheap Trick and Perry). The band also appeared in a McDonald&#x27;s advertising campaign called &quot;This Is Your Wake-Up Call&quot; featuring the band.

In 2007, officials of Rockford, Illinois, honored Cheap Trick by reproducing the &quot;Rockford&quot; album cover art on that year&#x27;s city vehicle sticker. On June 19, 2007, the Illinois Senate passed Senate Resolution 255, which designated April 1 of every year as Cheap Trick Day in the State of Illinois. In August of that year, Cheap Trick honored the 40th anniversary of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; by playing the album in its entirety with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by Edwin Outwater, along with guest vocalists including Joan Osborne and Aimee Mann.

On April 24, 2008, Cheap Trick performed at Japan&#x27;s Budokan arena in Chiyoda, Tokyo, for the 30th anniversary of the 1978 album &quot;Cheap Trick at Budokan&quot;.

Bun E. Carlos stopped touring and recording with the band, and officially left the band in 2010. Rick Nielsen&#x27;s son Daxx, who had filled in for Bun E. while he was recovering from back surgery in 2001, became the band&#x27;s touring drummer.

On July 17, 2011, at Canada&#x27;s Bluesfest in Ottawa, Ontario, a thunderstorm blew through the festival area 20 minutes into the band&#x27;s set. The band and crew were on the stage when, without warning, the 40-ton roof fell. It fell away from the audience and landed on the band&#x27;s truck, which was parked alongside the back of the stage. The van broke the fall and allowed everyone about 30 seconds to escape.

Carlos filed a lawsuit against his former bandmates in 2013. He claimed that even though they claimed that he was departed from Cheap Trick, he was not being allowed to participate in band-related activities, including recording. The remaining three members of Cheap Trick filed a countersuit, seeking a legal affirmation of their removal of Carlos. Their lawsuit was dismissed in late 2013. The legal dispute was eventually settled. Following the settlement, Carlos did not record or tour with them. The three remaining members decided they would continue Cheap Trick as a trio.

===Hall of Fame induction and later years (2016–present)===
On April 1, 2016, the band released its first album in five years, &quot;Bang, Zoom, Crazy... Hello&quot;. They released a single, &quot;No Direction Home,&quot; as a teaser for the album. The album was the band&#x27;s first record on a major label in 22 years. Daxx Nielsen played drums on the album.

On April 8, 2016, Cheap Trick was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

On June 16, 2017, the band released the album &quot;We&#x27;re All Alright!&quot;. Daxx Nielsen played drums on the album. In August 2017, the band appeared on Insane Clown Posse&#x27;s single &quot;Black Blizzard&quot;. On October 20, 2017, the band released a Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Christmas&quot;.

On January 29, 2021, Cheap Trick released the single &quot;Light Up the Fire&quot; in the run up to their album &quot;In Another World&quot;, due for release on April 9, 2021.

The band was announced as part of the 2021 Australian concert series, Under the Southern Stars, alongside Bush and Stone Temple Pilots. They replaced original headliners Live on the bill. In April 2021, the concert series was postponed to 2022.

When Petersson was sidelined from touring in 2021 due to open-heart surgery. Zander&#x27;s son, Robin Taylor Zander, filled in for him on tour.

==Legacy==
In 2016, Cheap Trick was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The induction ceremony was held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York on April 8, and the band was introduced by Kid Rock. Zander, Nielsen, Petersson, and Carlos were in attendance; with Carlos on drums, the band performed &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot;, &quot;Dream Police&quot;, &quot;Surrender&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;.

Cheap Trick have been cited as an influence on several artists in the alternative rock and power pop genre, including Nirvana, Green Day, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins.

<doc id="179318" wikidata="Q44016" url="?curid=179318" title="Markham, Ontario">
<text>Markham () is a city in York Region, Ontario, Canada. It is approximately northeast of Downtown Toronto. In the 2021 Census, Markham had a population of 338,503, which ranked it the largest in York Region, fourth largest in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and 16th largest in Canada.

The city gained its name from the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe (in office 1791–1796), who named the area after his friend, William Markham, the Archbishop of York from 1776 to 1807.

Indigenous people lived in the area of present-day Markham for thousands of years before Europeans arrived in the area. The first European settlement in Markham occurred when William Berczy, a German artist and developer, led a group of approximately sixty-four German families to North America. While they planned to settle in New York, disputes over finances and land tenure led Berczy to negotiate with Simcoe for in what would later become Markham Township in 1794. Since the 1970s, Markham rapidly shifted from being an agricultural community to an industrialized municipality due to urban sprawl from neighbouring Toronto. Markham changed its status from town to city on July 1, 2012.

, tertiary industry mainly drives Markham. , &quot;business services&quot; employed the largest proportion of workers in Markham – nearly 22% of its labour force.
The city also has over 1,000 technology and life-sciences companies, with IBM as the city&#x27;s largest employer. Several multinational companies have their Canadian headquarters in Markham, including: Honda Canada, Hyundai, Advanced Micro Devices,
Johnson &amp; Johnson, General Motors, Avaya, IBM, Motorola, Oracle, Toshiba, Toyota Financial Services, Huawei, Honeywell, General Electric and Scholastic Canada.

==History==

Indigenous people lived in the area of present-day Markham since the end of the last Ice Age and the city is situated on the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), Huron Wendat, Petun and Neutral people. In the early 1600s, when explorers from France arrived, they encountered the Huron-Wendat First Nation. The southwest corner of Markham is included in Treaty 13, known as the Toronto Purchase of 1787, which transferred roughly 250,800 acres of land from the Mississauga people to the British Crown for 10 shillings and fishing rights on the Etobicoke river. The remainder of Markham&#x27;s land (roughly east of Woodbine Avenue/Highway 404) is covered by the Johnson-Butler Purchase of 1787-88 (aka Gunshot Treaty) and formally by the Williams Treaties, signed in 1923.
Objects recovered by local mill-owners, the Milne family, in the 1870s give evidence of a village within the boundaries of the present Milne Conservation Area.

European settlement in Markham first began in 1794. The Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe (in office 1791–1796), named the township of Markham, north of the town of York (now Toronto), after his friend William Markham, then Archbishop of York. William Berczy first surveyed Markham as a township in 1793, and in 1794 led 75 German families (including the Ramers, Reesors, Wheters, Burkholders, Bunkers, Wicks and Lewis) from Upstate New York to an area of Markham now known as German Mills. Each family was granted of land; however the lack of roads in the region led many to settle in York (present-day Toronto) and Niagara. German Mills later became a ghost town. Between 1803 and 1812 another attempt at settling the region was made. The largest group of settlers were Pennsylvania Dutch, most of them Mennonites. These highly skilled craftsmen and knowledgeable farmers settled the region and founded Reesorville, named after the Mennonite settler Joseph Reesor. In 1825 Reesorville was renamed to Markham and took the name of the unincorporated village (see Markham Village, Ontario).

By 1830, many Irish, Scottish and English families began immigrating to Upper Canada and settling in Markham. Markham&#x27;s early years blended the rigours of the frontier with the development of agriculture-based industries. The township&#x27;s many rivers and streams soon supported water-powered saws and gristmills and later wooden mills. With improved transportation routes, such as the construction of Yonge Street in the 1800s, along with the growing population, urbanization increased. In 1842 the township population had reached 5,698; were under cultivation (second highest in the province), and the township had eleven gristmills and twenty-four sawmills.

In 1846 Smith&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Gazetteer&quot; indicated a population of about 300, mostly Canadians, Pennsylvanian Dutch (actually Pennsylvania Deitsch or German), other Germans, Americans, Irish and a few from Britain. There were two churches with a third being built. There were tradesmen of various types, a grist mill, an oatmill mill, five stores, a distillery and a threshing-machine maker. There were eleven grist and twenty-four saw mills in the surrounding township. In 1850 the first form of structured municipal government formed in Markham.

By 1857 most of the township had been cleared of timber and was under cultivation. Villages like Thornhill, Unionville and Markham greatly expanded. In 1851 Markham Village &quot;was a considerable village, containing between eight and nine hundred inhabitants, pleasantly situated on the Rouge River. It contains two grist mills ... a woollen factory, oatmeal mill, barley mill and distillery, foundry, two tanneries, brewery, etc., a temperance hall and four churches... .&quot; In 1871, with a township population of 8,152, the Toronto and Nipissing Railway built the first rail line to Markham Village and Unionville, which is still used today by the GO Transit commuter services.

In 1971 Markham was incorporated as a town, as its population skyrocketed due to urban sprawl from Toronto. In 1976 Markham&#x27;s population was approximately 56,000. Since that time, the population has more than quintupled, with explosive growth in new subdivisions. Much of Markham&#x27;s farmland has disappeared, but some still remains north of Major Mackenzie Drive. Controversy over the development of the environmentally-sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine will likely curb development north of Major Mackenzie Drive and by Rouge National Urban Park east of Reesor Road between Major Mackenzie Drive to Steeles Avenue East to the south.
Since the 1980s Markham has been recognized as a suburb of Toronto. the city comprises six major communities: Berczy Village, Cornell, Markham Village, Milliken, Thornhill and Unionville. Many high-tech companies have established head offices in Markham, attracted by the relative abundance of land, low tax-rates and good transportation routes. Broadcom Canada, ATI Technologies (now known as AMD Graphics Product Group), IBM Canada, Motorola Canada, Honeywell Canada and many other well-known companies have chosen Markham as their home in Canada. The city has accordingly started branding itself as Canada&#x27;s &quot;High-Tech Capital&quot;. The province of Ontario has erected a historical plaque in front of the Markham Museum to commemorate the founding of Markham&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage.

Town council voted on May 29, 2012, to change Markham&#x27;s legal designation from &quot;town&quot; to &quot;city&quot;; according to Councillor Alex Chiu, who introduced the motion, the change of designation merely reflects the fact that many people already think of Markham as a city. Some residents objected to the change because it will involve unknown costs without any demonstrated benefits. The designation officially took effect on July 1.

==Economy==

In the 19th century Markham had a vibrant, independent community with mills, distilleries and breweries around the intersection of Highway 7 and Markham Road. The Thomas Speight Wagon Works exported products (wagons, horsecars) around the world, and Markham had a reputation as being more active than York (the former name for Toronto) early on. Most of these industries disappeared leaving farming as the main source of business.

Light industries and businesses began to move into Markham in the 1980s attracted by land and lower taxes. Today, it claims to be &quot;Canada&#x27;s Hi-Tech Capital&quot; with a number of key companies in the area, such as IBM, Motorola, Toshiba, Honeywell, Apple, Genesis Microchip, and is home to the head office of graphics card producer ATI Technologies (in 2006 merged with AMD). Over 1,100 technology and life science companies have offices in Markham, employing over one fifth of the total workforce. In 2014, the top five employers in the city in order were IBM Canada, the City of Markham, TD Waterhouse Inc., Markham Stouffville Hospital and AMD Technologies Inc.

International Franchise Inc., which owns brands including Swensen&#x27;s and Yogen Früz and several others, has its headquarters in Markham.

General Motors Canada Canadian Technical Centre has been located in Markham since 2017, in the building which was formerly the Canadian head office of American Express from 1985 to 2015.

Many shopping centres in Markham are also ethnically Chinese and East Asian-oriented.

They carry a wide variety of traditional Chinese products, apparel, and foods.

On Highway 7, between Woodbine and Warden Avenues, is First Markham Place, containing numerous shops and restaurants; this is several kilometres east of Richmond Hill&#x27;s Chinese malls. Further east along Highway 7 is an older plaza is at the southwest quadrant with the intersection with Kennedy Road.

Pacific Mall is the most well-known Chinese mall in Markham, at Kennedy Road and Steeles Avenue East, which, combined with neighbouring Market Village (now closed) and Splendid China Mall, formed the second largest Chinese shopping area in North America, after the Golden Village in Richmond, British Columbia. In close proximity, at Steeles Avenue and Warden Avenue, there is the New Century Plaza mall and a half-block away there is a plaza of Chinese shops anchored by a T &amp; T Supermarket.

==Transportation==
===Roads===
==== Road network ====
Markham&#x27;s road network is based on the concession system. In 1801, Markham was divided into 10 concessions, with a north–south road separating each one. The concessions were further divided by a number of east–west sideroads. This formed a grid plan road network, with an intersection occurring approximately every two kilometers. Even though some of these roads have been realigned, Markham&#x27;s present road network for the most part still follows the original grid plan.

Markham&#x27;s concession (north–south) arterial roads are listed below, ordered from west to east (former numbers in parentheses):

* Yonge Street
** Boundary with the City of Vaughan
* Bayview Avenue
* Leslie Street
* Woodbine Avenue
* Warden Avenue (5th Concession Road)
* Kennedy Road (6th Concession Road)
* McCowan Road (7th Concession Road)
* Markham Road (8th Concession Road)
** Continues as Highway 48 north of Major Mackenzie Drive
* Ninth Line (9th Concession Road)
* Donald Cousens Parkway / Markham By-pass
** Signed as a regular road south of Box Grove By-pass
* Reesor Road (10th Concession Road)
* Eleventh Line (11th Concession Road)
* York-Durham Line
** Boundary with the City of Pickering

Reesor Road and Eleventh Line are the only north–south roads that are not fully regional roads. These two roads are rural routes with very few homes and minimal traffic. Eleventh Line ends just south of Highway 407 with the road rerouted (old section fenced off with partial gravel bed) to intersect with York-Durham Line. Areas east of Donald Cousens Boulevard either serve new residential developments or are largely rural and/or agricultural.

Markham&#x27;s sideroad (east–west) arterials are listed below, ordered from south to north (former numbers in parentheses):

* Steeles Avenue
** Original Scarborough Townline, boundary with the City of Toronto
* 14th Avenue
** Continues west of Warden Avenue as Alden Road
*** Continues west of Rodick Road as Esna Park Drive
**** Continues west of Woodbine Avenue as John Street
* Regional Road 7 (formerly 15th Avenue)
** Continues as Highway 7 east of Reesor Road
* 16th Avenue
* Major Mackenzie Drive East (17th Avenue)
* Elgin Mills Road East (18th Avenue)
** Signed as a standard road east of Victoria Square Boulevard
* 19th Avenue
** Boundary with the Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville

==== Important thoroughfares ====
Major highways that pass through Markham include King&#x27;s Highway 404 (from Toronto to just south of Lake Simcoe), which marks Markham&#x27;s boundary with the City of Richmond Hill, and the 407 ETR (more commonly known as Highway 407), a privately owned toll highway that passes north of Toronto and connects Markham with Burlington and Oshawa. Highway 404 is one of the most important routes used for travel to and from the City of Toronto. Highway 407 primarily serves Markham from Yonge Street to York-Durham Line. The highway connects Markham with Clarington to the east, and Burlington to the west.

One of the most heavily travelled arterial roads in Markham is Regional Road 7, a major east–west artery. This road is more commonly referred to as Highway 7, a name which comes from the time when it used to be a provincial highway. The road is still officially Highway 7 east of Reesor Road. Other major east–west routes include 16th Avenue, Major MacKenzie Drive, the combination of John Street/Esna Park Drive/14th Avenue, and Steeles Avenue which forms Markham&#x27;s southern boundary with Toronto.

===Rail===
The GO Transit Stouffville line, a commuter rail line stretching from Lincolnville to downtown Toronto, provides passenger rail service in Markham. It operates only at rush hour and uses tracks owned by Metrolinx, the provincial transit agency. Five stations on the Stouffville line serve Markham, of which 4 are within the municipal borders. In 2015, Metrolinx announced that the Stouffville Line would get an expansion in service, bringing all day both directional trains from Union Station to Unionville GO Station. Markham&#x27;s section of this GO line also came under the spotlight in 2015 as City of Toronto Mayor John Tory&#x27;s announced SMART Track plan for rapid transit expansion in Toronto includes the rail spur between Union Station and the Unionville GO.

On April 8, 2019, GO Transit added ten midday train trips to Mount Joy GO Station, replacing the need for passengers to change to buses at Unionville GO.

===Public transit===

York Region Transit (YRT) connects Markham with surrounding municipalities in York Region, and was created in 2001 from the merger of Markham Transit, Richmond Hill Transit, Newmarket Transit and Vaughan Transit. YRT to connects to the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) subway system by way of Viva bus rapid transit from Finch station along Yonge Street, and Don Mills station through Unionville and on to Markville Mall.

YRT has two major terminals in Markham: Unionville GO Terminal and the new Cornell Terminal, replacing Markham Stouffville Hospital Bus Terminal.

The TTC also provides service in Markham on several north–south routes, such as Warden Avenue, Birchmount Road, McCowan Road and Markham Road. These routes charge riders a double fare if they are travelling across the Steeles border.

GO Transit provides train service on the old trackbed of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway, which connects Markham with downtown Toronto on the Stouffville commuter rail service. The line has stops at several stations in Markham, namely Unionville GO Station, Centennial GO Station, Markham GO Station, and Mount Joy GO Station. The Richmond Hill commuter rail line provides service to the Langstaff GO Station, which straddles Markham and Richmond Hill but is used primarily by residents of west-central Markham and southern Richmond Hill.

===Air===
There is presently a private general aviation airport; Markham Airport or Toronto/Markham Airport, (TC LID: CNU8), just north of Markham, north of Elgin Mills Road. The airport is owned and operated by Markham Airport Inc. and owned by a numbered Ontario company owned by the Thomson family of Toronto, rather than the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA). The airport has a runway for small and private aircraft only (with night flying capabilities). The Royal Canadian Air Cadets Gliding Program formerly used the airport for glider operations in the spring and fall.

Buttonville Municipal Airport was a larger general aviation airport located near Highway 404 and 16th Avenue in the Buttonville neighbourhood that was operated by the GTAA. It closed in November 2023.

<doc id="179320" wikidata="Q1001214" url="?curid=179320" title="Buddy Ebsen">
<text>Buddy Ebsen (born Christian Ludolf Ebsen Jr.; April 2, 1908 – July 6, 2003), also known as Frank &quot;Buddy&quot; Ebsen, was an American actor and dancer. One of his most famous roles was as Jed Clampett in the CBS television sitcom &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971); afterwards he starred as the title character in the television detective drama &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; (1973–1980).

Originally a dancer, Ebsen began his film career in &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936.&quot; He also appeared as a dancer with child star Shirley Temple in &quot;Captain January&quot; (1936). He was cast to appear in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), originally as the Scarecrow, but before filming began, his role was changed to the Tin Man. He fell seriously ill during filming due to the aluminum dust in his makeup and was forced to drop out. He appeared with Maureen O&#x27;Hara in &quot;They Met in Argentina&quot; (1941) and June Havoc in &quot;Sing Your Worries Away&quot; (1942). In &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961), he portrayed Doc Golightly, the much older husband of Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s character. Before his starring role in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, Ebsen had a successful television career, the highlight of which was his role as Davy Crockett&#x27;s sidekick, George Russell, in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; miniseries (1953–54).

==Early years==
A middle child with four sisters, Buddy Ebsen was born as Christian Ludolf Ebsen Jr., on April 2, 1908, in Belleville, Illinois. His father, Christian Ludolf Ebsen Sr., was born in Niebüll, Germany in 1872 and moved to the United States in 1888. Ebsen Sr. worked as a choreographer and was a physical fitness advocate; he owned a dance studio and subsequently operated a swimming pool for the local school district. His mother, Frances (née Wendt), was a Baltic German (specifically, Latvian) painter.

Ebsen was raised in Belleville until the age of ten when his family moved to Palm Beach County, Florida. In 1920, Ebsen and his family relocated to Orlando, Florida. Ebsen and his sisters learned to dance at a dance studio his father operated in Orlando.

During his high school years, Ebsen became a member of John M. Cheney Chapter, Order of DeMolay. His involvement as a teenager led to his being recognized by DeMolay in adult life with the award of the Legion of Honor Degree, and later by induction into the DeMolay Alumni Hall of Fame.

Ebsen graduated from Orlando High School in 1926. Initially interested in a medical career, Ebsen attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, from 1926 to 1927, and then Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, from 1927 to 1928. Family financial problems caused by the collapse of the Florida land boom forced Ebsen to leave college at age 20.

==Career==
Ebsen left Orlando in the summer of 1928 to try his luck as a dancer in New York City, arriving with only $26.75 in his pocket, and worked at a soda fountain shop. He and his sister Vilma Ebsen performed as a dance act in supper clubs and in vaudeville — they were known as &quot;The Baby Astaires&quot;. On Broadway, the Ebsens appeared in the musicals &quot;Whoopee&quot;, &quot;Flying Colors&quot;, and &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1934&quot;. A rave review from New York columnist Walter Winchell, who saw them perform in Atlantic City, New Jersey, led to a booking at the Palace Theatre in New York City, the pinnacle of the vaudeville world.

===MGM signing===

Ebsen went on to appear in numerous films, both musicals and nonmusicals, including the 1936 &quot;Born to Dance&quot;, the 1936 &quot;Captain January&quot; (in which he danced with Shirley Temple), the 1937 &quot;Broadway Melody of 1938&quot; (with Judy Garland as his dance partner), and the 1938 &quot;The Girl of the Golden West&quot;. Ebsen partnered with actresses Eleanor Powell and Frances Langford, among others, and also danced solo.

Ebsen was noted for his unusual, surreal dancing and singing style (for example, his contribution to the &quot;Swingin&#x27; the Jinx Away&quot; finale of &quot;Born to Dance&quot;). His abilities might have been a reason filmmaker Walt Disney chose Ebsen to be filmed dancing in front of a grid as an aid to animating Mickey Mouse&#x27;s dancing in Disney&#x27;s 1929 to 1939 Silly Symphonies animated short films.

===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;===

Ebsen turned down Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s offer of an exclusive MGM contract, and Mayer warned him that he would never work in Hollywood again. Nonetheless, MGM cast him as the Scarecrow in its 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Ebsen then swapped roles with actor Ray Bolger, who was originally cast as the Tin Man. Bolger wanted to play the Scarecrow, and Ebsen did not object to the change. Ebsen had recorded all of his songs as the Tin Man, attended all the rehearsals, and had begun filming. However, he soon began experiencing body aches, muscle cramps, and shortness of breath, eventually leading to a lengthy hospitalization. Doctors determined that the aluminum dust used in the Tin Man makeup was coating his lungs and keeping his blood from being oxygenated, and he was forced to leave the production. Ebsen recalled in an interview included on the 2005 DVD release of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; that the MGM studio heads did not believe that he was ill until he was ordered back to the set and was intercepted by an angry nurse.

Ebsen was replaced by Jack Haley, with the makeup quickly changed to a safer aluminum paste. MGM did not publicize the true reason for Ebsen&#x27;s departure; even Haley was not told until much later. Haley re-recorded most of Ebsen&#x27;s vocals, although Ebsen&#x27;s Midwestern accent can still be heard on the soundtrack during several reprises of &quot;We&#x27;re Off to See the Wizard&quot;, with the enunciated &quot;r&quot; in the word &quot;wizard&quot;, as opposed to Haley&#x27;s Boston accent. Ebsen&#x27;s recording of the Tin Man&#x27;s solo &quot;If I Only Had a Heart&quot; is included on the deluxe edition of the film&#x27;s soundtrack, while a still photo recreation of the sequence featuring shots of Ebsen as the Tin Man was included as an extra with all VHS and DVD releases of the film since 1989. For the rest of his life, Ebsen complained of breathing problems from his involvement in &quot;that damned movie&quot;. Nonetheless, he outlived all the major cast members in the film, with only some Munchkin actors, extras such as Shep Houghton and stand-ins such as Caren Marsh Doll outliving him.

===World War II===
After recovering from the illness, Ebsen became embroiled in a contract dispute with MGM that left him idle for long periods. He took up sailing and became so proficient in seamanship that he taught the subject to naval officer candidates. He applied several times for a commission in the Navy in 1941, but was repeatedly turned down. The United States Coast Guard accepted his application for a commission, and he was promptly given the rank of lieutenant, junior grade. This wartime rank was one step up from the rank of ensign, the usual rank given newly appointed naval officers in peacetime. Ebsen served as damage control officer and later as executive officer on the Coast Guard-crewed Navy frigate , which recorded weather at its &quot;weather station&quot; 1,500 miles west of Seattle. These patrols consisted of 30 days at sea, followed by 10 days in port at Seattle. Ebsen was honorably discharged from the Coast Guard as a lieutenant in 1946.

===Return to acting===

Ebsen made his television debut on an episode of &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot; in 1949. This led to television appearances in: &quot;Stars Over Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Gruen Guild Playhouse&quot;, four episodes of &quot;Broadway Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;, &quot;Corky and White Shadow&quot;, the H.J. Heinz Company&#x27;s &quot;Studio 57&quot;, &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Climax!&quot;, &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, three episodes of &quot;Maverick&quot; (in which he portrayed assorted homicidal villains), and &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;. Ebsen received wide television exposure when he played Georgie Russel, a role based on a historical person and companion to frontiersman Davy Crockett, in the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television miniseries &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; (1954–1955).

In the 1958–1959 season, Ebsen co-starred in the 26-episode half-hour NBC television adventure series &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;. This series, the first half-hour Western filmed and broadcast in color on NBC, was a fictionalized account of Major Robert Rogers, a colonial American fighter for the British in the French and Indian War. Ebsen played the role of Sergeant Hunk Marriner; Keith Larsen played Rogers. From 1960 to 1962, Ebsen appeared in episodes of the television series &quot;Rawhide&quot; and &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;. Ebsen also portrayed a corrupt, bloodthirsty marshal in &quot;El Paso Stage&quot;, an episode of &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; broadcast in April 1961.

Between October 1961 and March 1962, Ebsen had a recurring role as Virge Blessing in the ABC drama series &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, the story of travelers passing through the bus station and diner in the fictitious town of Sunrise, Colorado. Robert Altman directed several episodes. Arthur O&#x27;Connell had played Virge Blessing in the earlier film version on which the series was loosely based. Ebsen also appeared as &quot;Mr. Dave&quot; Browne, a homeless hobo, on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; opposite Ron Howard, and as Jimbo Cobb in&quot; The Twilight Zone &quot;episode &quot;The Prime Mover&quot; (season 2, episode 21) in 1961. Throughout the show&#x27;s run, he played several characters on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; including as the episode title character in Season 17, Episode 11 (&quot;Drago&quot;). A notable exception to Ebsen&#x27;s continual work in Westerns and rural television shows was an acclaimed role as Doc Golightly, an older, rural veterinarian deserted by his young wife (played by Audrey Hepburn) in 1961&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;.

===&quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–1971)===
Ebsen became famous as Jed Clampett, an easygoing backwoods mountaineer who strikes oil and moves with his family to Beverly Hills, California, in the long-running, CBS sitcom &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

Although scorned by critics, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; attracted as many as 60 million viewers between 1962 and 1971 and was several times the highest-rated series on television. The show also spawned similar Paul Henning-produced rural sitcoms such as &quot;Green Acres&quot; and &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, which were eventually linked in crossover episode arcs. &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; was still earning good ratings when it was canceled by CBS (because programmers began shunning shows that attracted a rural audience). One episode, &quot;The Giant Jack Rabbit&quot;, broadcast January 8, 1964 (season 2, episode 16) was the highest-rated half-hour on television to that time and remains the most-watched half-hour sitcom episode.

Not all was harmonious among cast members on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; set, especially between the politically conservative Ebsen and the more liberal Nancy Kulp. Donna Douglas (Elly May) said, &quot;They had a different view, so they had some heated discussions about that. They would go at it for weeks.&quot; In 1984, Kulp unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat from Pennsylvania. To her dismay, Ebsen supported her Republican opponent, incumbent Representative Bud Shuster, going so far as to tape an ad for Shuster that labeled Kulp as &quot;too liberal&quot;. Ebsen claimed she was exploiting her celebrity status and did not know the issues.

===&quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; (1973–1980)===
Ebsen returned to television in 1973 as the title character of &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, which proved to be his second long-running television series. Barnaby Jones was a milk-drinking detective who came out of retirement to investigate the death of his son. The program lasted eight seasons and 178 episodes. Lee Meriwether, 1955 Miss America, played Barnaby&#x27;s widowed daughter-in-law, Betty Jones. Ebsen appeared briefly as Barnaby Jones on two other productions: a 1975 episode of &quot;Cannon&quot; and the 1993 film &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

Meriwether said of her on and off screen chemistry with Ebsen, &quot;He really worked at being at the top of his game.&quot; &quot;You had to keep up with him. I adored him. I think he had feelings for me, too.&quot; She also said of the man, &quot;I loved that man! I was so lucky. He was a dream.&quot; &quot;He loved the idea of being a detective. We had CSI-type equipment in the office on the set and he liked doing his own tests. It was a show the whole family could watch.&quot;

===Other television credits===
Ebsen&#x27;s last regular television series was &quot;Matt Houston&quot; on ABC, starring Lee Horsley. Ebsen played Matt&#x27;s uncle, Roy Houston, during the show&#x27;s third season from 1984 to 1985. He also appeared in &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;, a&quot; Night Gallery &quot;segment that originally aired January 26, 1972.

Ebsen narrated the documentary series &quot;Disney Family Album&quot; during the 1980s on the Disney Channel and Steven Kellogg&#x27;s &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot; on the PBS series &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; in 1985. He made his final guest-starring appearance in 1994 on an episode of the short-lived television series revival &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;.

===Later years===
Although generally retired from acting as he entered his 80s, Ebsen filmed a cameo in the 1993 film version of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; as Barnaby Jones. This was Ebsen&#x27;s final motion picture role. In 1999, Ebsen provided the voice of Chet Elderson for an episode of the Fox Entertainment program &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. This was his last TV appearance.

Ebsen has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1765 Vine Street, and a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

In 1993, Ebsen was inducted as a Disney Legends award winner.

==Personal life==

In 1936, Ebsen married Ruth Cambridge. They had two daughters. The marriage ended in divorce.

In 1945, Ebsen married fellow lieutenant Nancy Wolcott. They had four daughters, including Kiki Ebsen, and a son. This marriage, after 39 years, also ended in divorce in 1985. Ebsen&#x27;s daughters Kiki, Kathy, and Bonnie are all accomplished horsewomen.

In 1985, Ebsen married his third wife, Dorothy &quot;Dotti&quot; Knott, 40 years his junior. They had no children.

Throughout his life, Ebsen had many interests. He became a folk artist and an avid coin collector, co-founding the Beverly Hills Coin Club in 1987 with actor Chris Aable. Ebsen&#x27;s collection included many rarities such as a four-dollar gold piece worth $200,000. The coin collection was sold in several auctions both before and after his death. As Ebsen entered his nineties, he continued to keep active, and two years before his death, his bestselling novel &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Quest&quot; was published. Ebsen wrote several other books including &quot;Polynesian Concept&quot; (about sailing), &quot;The Other Side of Oz&quot; (an autobiography) and &quot;Sizzling Cold Case&quot; (a mystery based on his Barnaby Jones character).

Ebsen supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

==Death==
Ebsen died of respiratory failure at Torrance Memorial Medical Center in Torrance, California, on July 6, 2003, at the age of 95.

<text>Albert Giraud (; 23 June 1860 – 26 December 1929) was a Belgian poet who wrote in French.

==Biography==
Giraud was born Emile Albert Kayenbergh in Leuven, Belgium. He studied law at the University of Leuven. He left university without a degree and took up journalism and poetry. In 1885, Giraud became a member of La Jeune Belgique, a Belgian nationalist literary movement that met at the Café Sésino in Brussels. Giraud became chief librarian at the Belgian Ministry of the Interior.

He was a Symbolist poet. His published works include &quot;Pierrot lunaire: Rondels bergamasques&quot; (1884), a poem cycle based on the commedia dell&#x27;arte figure of Pierrot, and &quot;La Guirlande des Dieux&quot; (1910). The composer Arnold Schönberg set a German-language version (translated by Otto Erich Hartleben) of selections from his &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot; to innovative atonal music. In a different, late romantic style, some of Hartleben&#x27;s translations found their way into the vocal works of Joseph Marx.

<text>Umpqua County was a county located in the U.S. state of Oregon. It was created on January 24, 1851, by the Oregon Territorial Legislature embracing the lands along the Umpqua River in southwestern Oregon. Gold had been discovered in the Umpqua region, which brought a rapid increase of settlers to the new county. The first meeting of the Umpqua County Court was in Elkton in 1852; later the county government was moved to Green Valley and Yoncalla.

On January 7, 1852, the territorial legislature created Douglas County from the eastern part of Umpqua County. On December 22, 1853, part of the western portion of the county was included in the newly formed Coos County. Finally, on October 16, 1862, the remainder of Umpqua county was incorporated into Douglas County.

Some accounts state that politics caused the county&#x27;s end.

<text>Hurdling is the act of jumping over an obstacle at a high speed or in a sprint. In the early 19th century, hurdlers ran at and jumped over each hurdle (sometimes known as &#x27;burgles&#x27;), landing on both feet and checking their forward motion. Today, the dominant step patterns are the 3-step for high hurdles, 7-step for low hurdles, and 15-step for intermediate hurdles. Hurdling is a highly specialized form of obstacle racing, and is part of the sport of athletics. In hurdling events, barriers known as hurdles are set at precisely measured heights and distances. Each athlete must pass over the hurdles; passing under or intentionally knocking over hurdles will result in disqualification.

Accidental knocking over of hurdles is not cause for disqualification, but the hurdles are weighted to make doing so disadvantageous. In 1902 Spalding equipment company sold the Foster Patent Safety Hurdle, a wood hurdle. In 1923 some of the wood hurdles weighed each. Hurdle design improvements were made in 1935, when they developed the L-shaped hurdle. With this shape, the athlete could hit the hurdle and it will tip down, clearing the athlete&#x27;s path. The most prominent hurdles events are 110 meters hurdles for men, 100 meters hurdles for women, and 400 meters hurdles (both sexes) – these three distances are all contested at the Summer Olympics and the World Athletics Championships. The two shorter distances take place on the straight of a running track, while the 400 m version covers one whole lap of a standard oval track. Events over shorter distances are also commonly held at indoor track and field events, ranging from 50 meters hurdles upwards. Women historically competed in the 80 meters hurdles at the Olympics in the mid-20th century. Hurdles race are also part of combined events contests, including the decathlon and heptathlon.

In track races, hurdles are normally in height, depending on the age and sex of the hurdler. Events from 50 to 110 meters are technically known as high hurdles races, while longer competitions are low hurdles races. The track hurdles events are forms of sprinting competitions, although the 400 m version is less anaerobic in nature and demands athletic qualities similar to the 800 meters flat race.

A hurdling technique can also be found in the steeplechase, although in this event athletes are also permitted to step on the barrier to clear it. Similarly, in cross country running athletes may hurdle over various natural obstacles, such as logs, mounds of earth, and small streams – this represents the sporting origin of the modern events. Horse racing has its own variant of hurdle racing, with similar principles.

==Distances==

The standard sprint or short hurdle race is 110 meters for men and 100 meters for women. The standard number of steps to the first hurdle should be 8. The standard long hurdle race is 400 meters for both men and women. Each of these races is run over ten hurdles and they are all Olympic events.

The men&#x27;s 200 meters low hurdles event was on the Olympic athletics programme for the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics. These low hurdles events were widely participated in the early part of the 20th century, particularly in North America. However, beyond these two Olympic outings, they never gained a consistent place at international competitions and became increasingly rare after the 1960s. This 10-hurdle race continues to be run in places such as Norway.

Other distances are run, particularly indoors but occasionally outdoors. The sprint hurdle race indoors is usually 60 meters for both men and women, although races 55 meters or 50 meters long are sometimes run, especially in the United States. A 60-meter indoor race is run over 5 hurdles. A shorter race may occasionally have only 4 hurdles. Outdoors, a long hurdle race is sometimes shortened to 300 meters for younger participants, who run over 8 hurdles. For example, high school and middle school athletes in California, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania run the 300 meter hurdles instead of running the 400 meter hurdles, like the majority of state competitors run today. The distance the hurdles are spaced is identical to the beginning of a standard 400 meter race which would have 10 hurdles. There are also 200 meter races for middle school and younger divisions over 5 hurdles (spaced in the same position as the last 5 hurdles of a standard 400 meter race).

==Height and spacing==
There are five hurdle heights on most standard hurdles. The highest position (sometimes &quot;college high&quot; or &quot;open high&quot;) is used for men&#x27;s sprint hurdle races (60 m, and 110 m), which are . The next highest, (sometimes &quot;high school high&quot;
) is used by veteran men under age 50, and younger boys. The middle position of 36 inches (91.44 cm), (sometimes &quot;intermediate&quot;) which is used for men&#x27;s long hurdle races (400 m) plus some youth and veteran age divisions. The next lower position, is called the &quot;women&#x27;s high&quot; used for women&#x27;s short hurdle races. The lowest position, called the &quot;low hurdle&quot; is used for women&#x27;s long hurdles plus many youth and veteran races. Some races call for for youth or veteran events. Hurdles that go to this position are rare and are notable by having a sixth position.

In sprint hurdle races for men, regardless of the length of the race, the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is . In sprint hurdle races for women, the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is . In long hurdle events, whether for men or women, the first hurdle is from the starting line and the distance between hurdles is . Most races which are shorter than the standard distance (such as indoor races) are simply run over fewer hurdles but use the same distances from the starting line. There are variations on hurdle height and spacing for the age groups of athletes competing. See Masters athletics (track and field) and Youth athletics.

==Technique==


In order to obtain the optimal hurdling technique, one must first learn the proper running techniques. It is important that the runner stays on the balls of his or her feet for the entirety of the race. This makes a fluid movement between each stage of the race.

There is a technique that is desirable to accomplish efficient hurdling action during a race. Many runners rely mainly on raw speed, but proper technique and well-planned steps leading up to and between each hurdle can allow an efficient hurdler to outrun faster opponents. Generally, the efficient hurdler spends the minimum amount of time and energy going vertically over the hurdle, thus achieving maximum speed in the horizontal race direction down the track.

When approaching the first hurdle, athletes try to avoid stutter stepping (a term used to refer to the cutting of stride length before reaching a hurdle). This cuts the runner&#x27;s momentum and costs valuable time. Athletes attack the hurdle by launching at it from 6–7 feet away (depending on the runner&#x27;s closing speed); the lead leg extended yet slightly bent (because a straight leg leads to more time over the hurdle) so that the heel just narrowly clears the barrier&#x27;s height. After launching, the trail leg is tucked in horizontally and flat, close to the side of the hip. The objective is to minimize center-of-gravity deviation from normal sprinting and reduce time spent flying through the air.

In order to hurdle properly and not simply jump over it, a runner must adjust his or her hips to raise them over the hurdles. This involves the correct use of the lead leg, trail leg, and arm positions. The lead leg is the leg that goes over the hurdle first and should remain fairly straight. Upon crossing over the hurdle barrier, the runner&#x27;s lead leg snaps down quickly landing roughly beyond the hurdle. The trail leg follows the lead leg. The trail leg drives forward at the knee (not swinging, as swinging causes the trunk to straighten up), and pulls through to maintain stride length. An effective trail leg will be parallel to the top of the hurdle and will be as close to the top of the hurdle as possible. As the lead leg is being lifted over the hurdle, the opposite arm should cross the body parallel to the ground. This helps with the runner&#x27;s balance and rhythm throughout the race.

In men&#x27;s hurdles, it is usually necessary to straighten the leg at the top of the flight path over the hurdle, although a partial bend in the knee gains a faster push-off when the athlete hits the ground. The ability to do this depends on the runner&#x27;s leg length. As soon as the foot has cleared the hurdle, the knee starts bending again to lessen the effect of a long, slow pendulum. In women&#x27;s hurdles, the lead leg is usually straight and the center of gravity does not rise relative to a normal running stride. Another way to view it is the “foot-path”: &quot;shortest path up and the shortest path down&quot;. The opposite arm reaches farther forward and the elbow travels out to the side and then behind to make room for the trailing leg. The trailing leg also leads with the knee, but the foot and knee are horizontal, tucked up as tight as possible into the armpit.

As soon as the lead leg begins its descent, a strong downward push is exerted to enable the trailing leg&#x27;s knee to come up under the armpit and in front of the chest. This enables the recovery of some of the energy expended in the flight. As the lead leg touches down to the ground, it is critical that the runner remains in a sprint. As soon as his or her lead leg touches down, the trail leg arm drives the rest of the body forward.

In the 100 and 110-meter hurdle events, the fastest hurdlers use the three-step technique. This means that three large steps are taken in between all of the hurdles. In order to do this efficiently, hurdlers must take long strides and maintain their speed for the entire race. If a hurdler begins to slow down while three-stepping, they may not be able to make it through all of the hurdles and may have to switch to a four-stepping or five-stepping technique. When three- or five-stepping, a hurdler will use the same lead leg for all of the hurdles. If a hurdler four steps, they will have to switch lead legs at each hurdle.

A modern hurdle will fall over if a runner hits it. There is no penalty for hitting a hurdle (provided this is not judged deliberate). The misconception is based on old rules before the hurdles were weighted. In the 1932 Olympics, Bob Tisdall famously won the Olympic gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles in World Record time, but was not credited with the record due to knocking over a hurdle. There can be a disqualification if a hurdler knocks a hurdle into an opponent&#x27;s lane and it is judged to have interfered with the opponent&#x27;s ability to run the race. There are now specifications for the tipping weight of a hurdle (the weights need to be adjusted to correspond with the height of the hurdle) so hitting a hurdle theoretically slows down the rhythm of the hurdler. However, pushing the hurdle with one&#x27;s hands or running out of one&#x27;s lane as a result of hitting the hurdle is cause for disqualification. While hitting hurdles is not generally considered desirable, a few sprint hurdlers have succeeded despite knocking over many hurdles. Contact with hurdles can decrease speed and also result in disruption of a hurdler&#x27;s technique. Some coaches suggest if you lightly &quot;kiss&quot; the hurdle with the side of the leg closest to the hurdle, it can help with the runner&#x27;s speed by keeping the runner closer to the ground.

==Variants==
There are also shuttle hurdle relay races, although they are rarely run. They are usually only found at track meets that consist entirely of relay races. In a shuttle hurdle relay, each of four hurdlers on a team runs the opposite direction from the preceding runner. The standard races correspond to the standard sprint hurdle races: 4 × 110 m for men and 4 × 100 m for women.

The shuttle hurdle relay has a maximum of only 4 teams, since most tracks only have 8 lanes. Two lanes will be taken up by one team. The #1 and #3 runners on the team will run in one direction down one specific lane and the #2 and #4 runners will run in the opposite direction in the other lane. The runners on each team go in sequence from 1 to 4.

Instead of using batons, the runners waiting for their teammate to finish must wait until their teammate gets to a certain point to begin their part of the race. There will be an official looking to see if they take off too early. If they do so, then they will be disqualified; if they take off late then it will just hurt their time and chances of winning the event.

In the United States, the men&#x27;s team of Aries Merritt, Jason Richardson, Aleec Harris, and David Oliver, set the world record in the 440m shuttle hurdle relay race at a time of 52.94 seconds (set on April 25, 2015). On the women&#x27;s side, Brianna Rollins, Dawn Harper-Nelson, Queen Harrison, Kristi Castlin, together ran a 400m shuttle hurdle race at a world record time of 50.50 seconds on August 24, 2015.

Shuttle hurdle relay was introduced at the 2019 IAAF World Relays, it consist of a race in which two men and two women on each team are running a 110 m hurdles.

<doc id="179326" wikidata="Q8594" url="?curid=179326" title="101 Dalmatians (1996 film)">
<text>101 Dalmatians is a 1996 American adventure comedy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Great Oaks Entertainment, and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Directed by Stephen Herek from a screenplay by John Hughes (who co-produces the film), it is a live-action remake of the 1961 animated film &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, which was based on the 1956 novel &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; by Dodie Smith. The film stars Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels, Joely Richardson, Joan Plowright, Hugh Laurie, Mark Williams, and John Shrapnel. Unlike the 1961 original film, none of the animals speak.

&quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; was released on November 27, 1996, and grossed $320.7 million in theaters against a $67 million budget, making it the sixth-highest-grossing film of 1996, despite receiving mixed to unfavorable reviews. Close was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, while the film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Makeup and Hair.

==Plot==

American video game designer Roger Dearly lives with his pet Dalmatian Pongo in London. One day, Pongo sets his eyes on Perdita, another Dalmatian. After a chase that ends in St James&#x27;s Park, Roger discovers that Pongo likes Perdita. Her owner, Anita Campbell-Green, falls in love with Roger when they meet. When they return to Roger&#x27;s home, Anita accepts his proposal. They get married along with Perdita and Pongo. Anita works as a fashion designer at the House of de Vil. Her boss, Cruella de Vil, has a deep passion for fur, going so far as to have a taxidermist, Mr. Skinner, skin a white tiger at the London Zoo to make her into a rug for her. Anita, inspired by her Dalmatian, designs a coat made with spotted fur. Cruella is intrigued by the idea of making garments out of actual Dalmatians, and finds it amusing that it would seem as if she was wearing Anita&#x27;s dog.

Perdita gets pregnant, and so does Anita. Cruella visits their home and becomes excited when she learns that Perdita is expecting. Weeks later, she returns when a litter of 15 puppies are born and offers Roger and Anita £7,500 for them, but they refuse. Enraged, Cruella dismisses Anita and vows revenge against her and Roger. One winter evening, she has her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, break into their home and steal the puppies, while the couple is walking in the park with Pongo and Perdita. Along with 84 other Dalmatians that were previously stolen, they deliver them to her country estate, De Vil Mansion. Cruella asks Skinner to kill and skin them to create her coat.

With the family devastated at the loss of their puppies, Pongo uses the twilight bark to carry the message via the dogs and other animals of the United Kingdom, while Roger and Anita notify the police. Anita realizes Cruella was behind the kidnappings and confirms her suspicion when she shows Roger and Nanny her portfolio. An Airedale Terrier follows Jasper and Horace to the mansion, and finds all of the puppies, who he helps escape under the duo&#x27;s noses. They make their way to a nearby farm, where they are later joined by Pongo and Perdita. Cruella arrives at the mansion and discovers what has happened. Angry with the thieves&#x27; failure, she decides to carry out the job herself. After several mishaps, Jasper and Horace discover nearby police looking for Cruella and hand themselves in, joining Skinner who was attacked in defense while trying to capture a puppy who had been left behind. Cruella tracks the puppies to the farm and tries to capture them, but the farm animals incapacitate her. The police arrive and arrest Cruella, before sending the puppies home.

Pongo, Perdita and their puppies are reunited with Roger, Anita and Nanny. After being informed that the remaining 84 puppies have no home to go to, as they have not yet been claimed by any owners, they decide to adopt them. Roger designs a successful video game featuring Dalmatian puppies as the protagonists and Cruella as the villain. With this success, they move out of London to the countryside with their millions. Roger and Anita have a baby girl, while the dogs grow up with puppies of their own.

==Cast==
== Production ==
The animatronic creatures used in the film are provided by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop. Producer Edward S. Feldman guaranteed the adoption of every puppy used in the film. Over 300 Dalmatian puppies were used over the course of filming, because &quot;we could only use them when they were 5 or 6 weeks old and at their cutest.&quot; Filming took place at Shepperton Studios in London.

Writer John Hughes approached Glenn Close for the role of Cruella de Vil, but she initially turned it down. The film&#x27;s costume designer Anthony Powell, who was working with Close on the Broadway show &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, then convinced her to take it.

Minster Court was used as the exterior of Cruella de Vil&#x27;s fashion house. Sarum Chase was used as the exterior of her home. Cruella&#x27;s car is a modified 1976 Panther De Ville.

The site&#x27;s critic consensus reads: &quot;Neat performance from Glenn Close aside, &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; is a bland, pointless remake.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of four and said, &quot;For older viewers, &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; may seem closer to the artistic level of the &quot;Beethoven&quot; dog adventures than the mid-level Disney classic that inspired it. Hint: Don&#x27;t wear your fur coat to the movie.&quot;

==Controversy==
Animal rights organizations protested the film&#x27;s release, saying that Dalmatian sales shot up after the premiere, fueled by impulsive purchases of puppies by parents for their children. Being ill-prepared to care for a relatively difficult breed of dog past puppy-hood, many of these new owners eventually surrendered their animals to shelters, where many dogs ended up being euthanized.

==Sequel and backstory==

A sequel, &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot;, was released on November 22, 2000. Glenn Close returned in her role.

Disney planned a live-action Cruella de Vil backstory film on the title character&#x27;s origins titled &quot;Cruella&quot;. Glenn Close was an executive producer and Emma Stone played the title role. The film was released on May 28, 2021. In June 2021, Disney announced its sequel was officially in the early stages of development.

<text>Burt Freeman Bacharach ( ; May 12, 1928 – February 8, 2023) was an American composer, songwriter, record producer, and pianist who is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential figures of 20th-century popular music. Starting in the 1950s, he composed hundreds of pop songs, many in collaboration with lyricist Hal David. Bacharach&#x27;s music is characterized by unusual chord progressions and time signature changes, influenced by his background in jazz, and uncommon selections of instruments for small orchestras. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output.

More than 1,000 different artists have recorded Bacharach&#x27;s songs. From 1961 to 1972, most of Bacharach and David&#x27;s hits were written specifically for and performed by Dionne Warwick, but earlier associations (from 1957 to 1963) saw the composing duo work with Marty Robbins, Perry Como, Gene McDaniels, and Jerry Butler. Following the initial success of these collaborations, Bacharach wrote hits for singers such as Gene Pitney, Cilla Black, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones and B. J. Thomas.

Bacharach wrote fifty-two US Top 40 hits. Those that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 include &quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love with You&quot; (Herb Alpert, 1968), &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; (Thomas, 1969), &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot; (the Carpenters, 1970), &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme (Best That You Can Do)&quot; (Christopher Cross, 1981), &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; (Warwick, 1986), and &quot;On My Own&quot; (Carole Bayer Sager, 1986). His accolades include six Grammy Awards, three Academy Awards, and one Emmy Award.

Bacharach is described by writer William Farina as &quot;a composer whose venerable name can be linked with just about every other prominent musical artist of his era&quot;; in later years, his songs were newly appropriated for the soundtracks of major feature films, by which time &quot;tributes, compilations, and revivals were to be found everywhere&quot;. A significant figure in easy listening, he influenced later musical movements such as chamber pop and &quot;Shibuya-kei&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Bacharach and David at number 32 for their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time&quot;. In 2012, the duo received the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, the first time the honor has been given to a songwriting team.

==Early life and education==
Bacharach was born in Kansas City, Missouri, and grew up in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, graduating from Forest Hills High School in 1946. He was the son of Irma M. (née Freeman) and Mark Bertram &quot;Bert&quot; Bacharach, a well-known syndicated newspaper columnist. His mother was an amateur painter and songwriter and encouraged Bacharach to practice piano, drums and cello during his childhood. His family was Jewish, but he said that they did not practice or give much attention to their religion. &quot;But the kids I knew were Catholic,&quot; he added. &quot;I was Jewish, but I didn&#x27;t want anybody to know about it.&quot;

Bacharach showed a keen interest in jazz as a teenager, disliking his classical piano lessons, and often used a fake ID to gain admission into 52nd Street nightclubs. He got to hear bebop musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, whose style influenced his songwriting.

Bacharach studied music (Associate of Music, 1948) at McGill University in Montreal, under Helmut Blume, at the Mannes School of Music in New York City, and at the Music Academy of the West in Montecito, California. During this period he studied a range of music, including jazz, whose sophisticated harmony is a distinctive feature of many of his compositions. His composition teachers included Darius Milhaud, Henry Cowell, and Bohuslav Martinů. Bacharach cited Milhaud, under whose guidance he wrote a &quot;Sonatina for Violin, Oboe and Piano&quot;, as his greatest influence.

==Career==
===1950s===
Bacharach was drafted into the U.S. Army in the late 1940s and served for two years. He was stationed in Germany and played piano in officers&#x27; clubs there, and at Fort Dix and Governors Island. During this time, he arranged and played music for dance bands. 

Bacharach met the popular singer Vic Damone while they were both serving in the army in Germany. Following his discharge, Bacharach spent the next three years as a pianist and conductor for Damone, who recalled, &quot;Burt was clearly bound to go out on his own. He was an exceptionally talented, classically trained pianist, with very clear ideas on the musicality of songs, how they should be played, and what they should sound like. I appreciated his musical gifts.&quot; He later worked in a similar capacity for various other singers, including Polly Bergen, Steve Lawrence, the Ames Brothers, and Paula Stewart (who became his first wife). When he was unable to find better jobs, Bacharach worked at resorts in the Catskill Mountains of New York, where he accompanied singers such as Joel Grey.

In 1956, at the age of 28, Bacharach&#x27;s productivity increased when composer Peter Matz recommended him to Marlene Dietrich, who needed an arranger and conductor for her nightclub shows. He then became a part-time music director for Dietrich, the actress and singer who had been an international screen star during the golden age of Hollywood. They toured worldwide off and on until the early 1960s. When they were not touring, he wrote songs. As a result of his collaboration with Dietrich, he gained his first major recognition as a conductor and arranger.

In her autobiography, Dietrich wrote that Bacharach particularly loved touring in Russia and Poland, because he thought very highly of the violinists performing there, and appreciated the public&#x27;s reaction. According to Dietrich, he also liked Edinburgh and Paris, along with the Scandinavian countries, and &quot;he also felt at home in Israel&quot;, she wrote, &quot;where music was similarly much revered&quot;. In the early 1960s, after about five years with Dietrich, their working relationship ceased, with Bacharach telling Dietrich that he wanted to devote himself full-time to songwriting. She thought of her time with him as &quot;seventh heaven ... As a man, he embodied everything a woman could wish for ... How many such men are there? For me he was the only one.&quot;

Also in 1956, Bacharach and lyricist Hal David, who were both working in the Brill Building in New York City for Famous Music, published their first songs as co-writers. The songs published in 1956 included &quot;I Cry More&quot; (featured in the motion picture &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot;), &quot;The Morning Mail&quot;, and &quot;Peggy&#x27;s In The Pantry&quot;. The two received a career breakthrough when their song &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; was recorded by Marty Robbins, becoming a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Country Chart in 1957. Soon afterward, &quot;Magic Moments&quot; was recorded by Perry Como for RCA Records, and reached No. 4 on the Most Played by Disc Jockeys chart. These two songs were also the first singles by a songwriting duo to ever reach back-to-back No. 1 in the UK (The British chart-topping &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; version was sung by Michael Holliday). Between 1956 and the dissolution of their partnership in the mid-1970s, Bacharach and David wrote over 230 songs together for the pop market, motion pictures, television, and Broadway.

===1960s===
Despite Bacharach&#x27;s early success with Hal David, he spent several years in the early 1960s writing songs with several other lyricists in addition to continuing his work with David. During this period, Bacharach found the most success with songs written with lyricist Bob Hilliard, including &quot;Please Stay&quot; (The Drifters, 1961), &quot;Tower of Strength&quot; (Gene McDaniels, 1961), &quot;Any Day Now (My Wild Beautiful Bird)&quot; (Chuck Jackson, 1962), and &quot;Mexican Divorce&quot; (The Drifters, 1962). In 1961, Bacharach was credited as arranger and producer, for the first time on both label and sleeve, for the song &quot;Three Wheels on My Wagon&quot;, written jointly with Hilliard for Dick Van Dyke.

Bacharach&#x27;s career received a boost when singer Jerry Butler asked to record &quot;Make It Easy on Yourself&quot; and also wanted him to direct the recording sessions. It became the first time Bacharach managed the entire recording process for one of his own songs.

In 1961 Bacharach discovered singer Dionne Warwick, who was working as a session backup singer at the time. That year the two, along with Dionne&#x27;s sister Dee Dee Warwick, released the single &quot;Move It on the Backbeat&quot; under the name Burt and the Backbeats. The lyrics for this Bacharach composition were provided by Hal David&#x27;s brother Mack David. 

Bacharach and Hal David were both excited by Warwick&#x27;s singing and decided to form a production company, Blue JAC Productions, so they could write for Warwick and produce her recordings. Warwick signed with Bacharach and David&#x27;s new company, and the team subsequently secured a recording contract with Scepter Records for Warwick&#x27;s recordings. Warwick made her solo recording debut in 1962 with &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot;, which also became her first hit. As business partners, Bacharach and David began writing almost exclusively with each other from 1962 until the dissolution of their partnership in the mid-1970s.

Bacharach and David&#x27;s partnership with Warwick became one of the most successful teams in popular music history. Over the next 20 years, Warwick&#x27;s recordings of Bacharach and David songs sold over 12 million copies, with 38 singles making the charts and 22 in the Top 40. Among the hits were &quot;Walk On By&quot;, &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot;, &quot;Alfie&quot;, &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;, and &quot;Do You Know the Way to San Jose&quot;.

Bacharach released his first solo album in 1965 on the Kapp Records label. &quot;Hit Maker!: Burt Bacharach Plays the Burt Bacharach Hits&quot; was largely ignored in the U.S. but rose to No. 3 on the UK album charts, where his version of &quot;Trains and Boats and Planes&quot; had become a top five single. In 1967, he signed with A&amp;M Records both as an artist and a producer, recording several solo albums (all consisting in a mix of new material and rearrangements of his best-known songs) until 1978.

In addition to having his work recorded by pop and R&amp;B acts, Bacharach&#x27;s songs were occasionally recorded during these years by jazz and rock acts. The Bacharach/David composition &quot;My Little Red Book&quot;, originally recorded by Manfred Mann for the film &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, was also recorded by the psychedelic rock band Love and released as the band&#x27;s first single. The Love version of the song went to number 52 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart and is considered by some writers to be a 1960s rock classic. In 1968, jazz musician Stan Getz recorded twelve Bacharach and David songs for &quot;What the World Needs Now: Stan Getz Plays Burt Bacharach and Hal David&quot;. Bacharach expressed delight and surprise for this choice, saying quote, &quot;I&#x27;ve sometimes felt that my songs are restrictive for a jazz artist. I was excited when [Stan] Getz did a whole album of my music&quot;. His songs were also adapted by several other jazz artists of the time, such as Grant Green, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans, and Cal Tjader. 

Bacharach also continued to get commissions for film scores, including those for the 1966 heist comedy After the Fox and the 1967 James Bond spy parody &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. The music for &quot;Casino Royale&quot; included &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, performed by Dusty Springfield, and the instrumental title song, which was a Top 40 single for Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. The soundtrack album is widely considered to be one of the finest engineered vinyl recordings of all time, and is much sought after by audiophile collectors.

Bacharach and David also collaborated with Broadway producer David Merrick on the 1968 musical &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, which yielded two hits, including the title tune and &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;. Bacharach and David wrote the latter song when the producer realized the play urgently needed another before its opening the next evening. Bacharach, who had just been released from the hospital after contracting pneumonia, was still sick, but worked with David&#x27;s lyrics to write the song which was performed for the show&#x27;s opening. It was later recorded by Dionne Warwick and was on the charts for several weeks. &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; was the second musical created by Bacharach and David who had earlier written the 1966 television musical &quot;On the Flip Side&quot; for the anthology program &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;; a work which starred Ricky Nelson and Joanie Sommers. 

Also in 1968, the duo&#x27;s song &quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love with You&quot; was recorded by Herb Alpert, who was best known at the time as a fellow songwriter and a trumpet player as the leader of the Tijuana Brass. The song went on to reach the top spot on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles chart later that year, becoming the first No. 1 hit for Alpert and his label, A&amp;M Records.

The year 1969 marked, perhaps, the most successful Bacharach-David collaboration, the Oscar-winning &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot;, written for and prominently featured in the acclaimed film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;. The two were also awarded a Grammy for Best Cast album of the year for &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;; the score was nominated for a Tony Award, as well. 
Bacharach and David&#x27;s other Oscar nominations for Best Song in the latter half of the 1960s were for &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, and &quot;Alfie&quot;.

===1970s and 1980s===
Throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s, Bacharach continued to write and produce for artists, compose for stage, TV, and film, and release his own albums. He enjoyed a great deal of visibility in the public spotlight, appearing frequently on TV and performing live in concert. Between November 1969 and January 1974, Bacharach and his music were the focus of nine U.S. network television specials, including five on NBC, three on ABC, and one on CBS. &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine gave him a lengthy cover story entitled &quot;The Music Man 1970&quot;.

In 1971, Barbra Streisand appeared on the special &quot;Singer Presents Burt Bacharach&quot;, where they discussed their careers and favorite songs and performed songs together. The other guests on the television special were dancers Rudolph Nureyev and Bettie de Jong, and singer Tom Jones.

In 1973, Bacharach and David wrote the songs for &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, a film-musical remake of the 1937 dramatic adventure film of the same title. A conflict arose between the two songwriters during the film&#x27;s production, and strained their professional relationship to the point that they stopped working together regularly. As Bacharach explained the situation in his 2013 memoir, he grew dissatisfied with his share of the potential film profits, because, in addition to providing the music for the songs, he was also doing underscore music for the film, which he felt he was not being fairly paid for. Bacharach asked David for a larger share of the profits, and David refused to renegotiate. When the film was released, it was poorly received and lost an estimated $9 million, but by that point, Bacharach was refusing to work on additional projects with David. Dionne Warwick, whose lucrative 1971 Warner Bros. Records contract was based on having Bacharach and David as her production team, sued the songwriters because they could not fulfill the terms of their agreement with her, putting her relationship with Warner Bros. Records in jeopardy. David in turn sued Bacharach for abandoning their legal partnership, and the lawsuits among the three parties took many years to resolve.

Despite the ongoing lawsuits, Bacharach and Warwick reunited in the studio in 1974 to record three new Bacharach songs for Warner Brothers, though the songs remained unreleased until 2013. Bacharach and David also reunited briefly, in 1975, to write and produce Stephanie Mills&#x27; second album, &quot;For The First Time&quot;, released by Motown. 

Following the Stephanie Mills album, the Bacharach &amp; David partnership was effectively over, and both songwriters began working with other collaborators. During the 1990s, they briefly reunited on two occasions, in 1993 to write a song for a Warwick album, and in 1999, to write two songs for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Great&quot;. Bacharach eventually expressed regret over his actions during the &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; production, and wrote in his autobiography:

Bacharach also suggested in interviews he gave to promote his autobiography that he and David were out of inspiration by the time they stopped working together. Discussing the breakup of their artistic partnership in a 2013 interview with author Mitch Albom, Bacharach said: 

From 1975 to 1980, Bacharach wrote songs with a number of lyricists including Paul Anka, James J. Kavanaugh, Norman Gimbel, Libby Titus, Anthony Newley, and playwright Neil Simon. His solo albums from the late 1970s, including &quot;Futures&quot; and &quot;Woman&quot;, failed to yield hits. 

By the early 1980s, Bacharach&#x27;s marriage to Angie Dickinson had ended, but a new partnership with lyricist Carole Bayer Sager proved rewarding, both commercially and personally. The first song they collaborated on was &quot;Where Did the Time Go&quot; by The Pointer Sisters, released as a single in 1980. Bacharach and Bayer Sager co-wrote 11 of the songs on Bayer Sager&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Sometimes Late at Night&quot;, and Bacharach produced the album. Music critic Joe Viglione called the album &quot;the Sgt. Pepper of singer/songwriter recordings&quot; and &quot;the epitome of &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s adult contemporary...a classic of the genre.&quot;

The two married and collaborated on several major hits during the decade, including &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Theme (Best That You Can Do)&quot; (Christopher Cross), co-written with Christopher Cross and Peter Allen, which won an Academy Award for Best Song; &quot;Heartlight&quot; (Neil Diamond); &quot;Making Love&quot; (Roberta Flack); and &quot;On My Own&quot; (Patti LaBelle with Michael McDonald).

Another of their hits, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; in 1985, reunited Bacharach and Warwick. When asked about their coming together again, she explained:

Other artists continued to revive Bacharach&#x27;s earlier hits in the 1980s and 1990s. Examples included Luther Vandross&#x27;s recording of &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;, Naked Eyes&#x27; 1983 pop hit version of &quot;(There&#x27;s) Always Something There to Remind Me&quot;, and Ronnie Milsap&#x27;s 1982 country version of &quot;Any Day Now&quot;. Bacharach continued a concert career, appearing at auditoriums throughout the world, often with large orchestras. He occasionally joined Warwick for sold-out concerts in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and New York City, where they performed at the Rainbow Room in 1996.

===1990s and beyond===

Bacharach&#x27;s visibility increased in the second half of the 1990s due to his appearances as himself in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films, a U.S. box set release of his music and a new songwriting partnership that produced a Grammy-winning album. Bacharach formed his songwriting partnership with Elvis Costello initially to write one song, &quot;God Give Me Strength&quot;, for the 1996 film &quot;Grace of My Heart&quot;. The film told the story of a fictional 1960s female Brill Building songwriter and was inspired by songwriters like Carole King and Bacharach. 

In 1998, Bacharach and Costello released the album &quot;Painted from Memory&quot;, on which the pair continued to work in the 1960s and 1970s pop style that they used for their initial collaboration. The album&#x27;s song &quot;I Still Have That Other Girl&quot; won a Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. The duo would later reunite for Costello&#x27;s 2018 album, &quot;Look Now&quot;, working on several tracks together. Also in 1998, Rhino Records released a 3-CD box set, &quot;The Look of Love&quot;, that licensed the original recordings of most of his best-known songs. Music writer Richie Unterberger called the set &quot;the best representation of [Bacharach&#x27;s] music likely to ever be assembled.&quot;

In 2003, he arranged and produced Ronald Isley&#x27;s album &quot;Here I Am&quot;, on which Isley sang a program of Bacharach songs mostly drawn from Bacharach&#x27;s 1960s-era hits. Bacharach&#x27;s 2005 solo album &quot;At This Time&quot; was a departure from past works in that Bacharach penned his own lyrics, some of which dealt with political themes. Guest stars on the album included Elvis Costello, Rufus Wainwright, and hip-hop producer Dr. Dre.

In 2008, Bacharach opened the BBC Electric Proms at The Roundhouse in London, performing with the BBC Concert Orchestra accompanied by guest vocalists Adele, Beth Rowley, and Jamie Cullum. The concert was a retrospective look back at his six-decade career. In early 2009, Bacharach worked with Italian soul singer Karima Ammar and produced her debut single &quot;Come In Ogni Ora&quot;.

Bacharach&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart&quot;, was published in 2013.

In June 2015, Bacharach performed in the UK at the Glastonbury Festival, and a few weeks later appeared on stage at the Menier Chocolate Factory in Southwark, South London, to launch &quot;What&#x27;s It All About? Bacharach Reimagined&quot;, a 90-minute live arrangement of his hits.

In 2016, Bacharach, at 88 years old, composed and arranged his first original score in 16 years for the film &quot;A Boy Called Po&quot; (along with composer Joseph Bauer). The score was released on September 1, 2017. The entire 30-minute score was recorded in just two days at Capitol Studios. The theme song, &quot;Dancing with Your Shadow&quot;, was composed by Bacharach, with lyrics by Billy Mann, and performed by Sheryl Crow. After seeing the film, a true story about a child with autism, Bacharach decided he wanted to write a score for it, as well as a theme song, in tribute to his daughter Nikki—who had gone undiagnosed with Asperger syndrome, and who committed suicide because of depression at the age of 40. &quot;It touched me very much&quot;, the composer said. &quot;I had gone through this with Nikki. Sometimes you do things that make you feel. It&#x27;s not about money or rewards.&quot;

In 2018, Bacharach released &quot;Live to See Another Day&quot;, co-written with Rudy Pérez and featuring the Miami Symphony Orchestra; the song was dedicated to survivors of gun violence in schools, as the proceeds from the release went to the charity Sandy Hook Promise, a non-profit organization founded and led by several family members whose children had been killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.

In July 2020, Bacharach collaborated with songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Tashian on the EP &quot;Blue Umbrella&quot;, Bacharach&#x27;s first new material in 15 years. It earned Bacharach and Tashian a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.

In March 2023, a collection of Bacharach&#x27;s collaborations with Elvis Costello, &quot;The Songs of Bacharach &amp; Costello&quot;, was released. The collection includes 16 tracks from the proposed stage musical &quot;Taken From Life&quot;.

==Film and television==
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bacharach was featured in a dozen television musical and variety specials videotaped in the UK for ITC; several were nominated for Emmy Awards for direction (by Dwight Hemion). The guests included artists such as Joel Grey, Dusty Springfield, Dionne Warwick, and Barbra Streisand. Bacharach and David did the score for an original musical for ABC-TV titled &quot;On the Flip Side&quot;, broadcast on &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;, starring Ricky Nelson as a faded pop star trying for a comeback.

In 1969, Harry Betts arranged Bacharach&#x27;s instrumental composition &quot;Nikki&quot; (named for Bacharach&#x27;s daughter) into a new theme for the &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;, a television series that ran on the U.S. network until 1976.

During the 1970s, Bacharach and then-wife Angie Dickinson appeared in several television commercials for Martini &amp; Rossi beverages, and Bacharach even penned a short jingle (&quot;Say Yes&quot;) for the spots. He also occasionally appeared on television/variety shows such as &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and others.

In the 1990s and 2000s Bacharach had cameo roles in Hollywood movies, including all three Austin Powers movies, inspired by his score for the 1967 James Bond parody film &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Mike Myers said the first film in the series, &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997), was partially inspired by the song &quot;The Look of Love&quot;. After hearing the song on the radio, Myers began reminiscing about the 1960s, which helped him conceive the film. Myers later said of Bacharach&#x27;s appearance in the movie: &quot;It was amazing working with Burt. His song &quot;The Look of Love&quot; was the inspiration for this film. It was like having Gershwin appear in your movie.&quot;

Bacharach appeared as a celebrity performer and guest vocal coach for contestants on the television show &quot;American Idol&quot; during its 2006 season, during which an entire episode was dedicated to his music. In 2008, Bacharach was featured in the BBC Electric Proms at The Roundhouse with the BBC Concert Orchestra. He performed similar shows the same year at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and with the Sydney Symphony.

==Musical style==
Bacharach&#x27;s music is characterized by unusual chord progressions, influenced by jazz harmony, with striking syncopated rhythmic patterns, irregular phrasing, frequent modulation, and odd, changing meters. He arranged, conducted, and produced much of his recorded output. Though his style is sometimes called easy listening, he expressed apprehension regarding that label, as some of his frequent collaborators did. According to &quot;NJ.com&quot; contributor Mark Voger, &quot;It may be easy on the ears, but it&#x27;s anything but easy. The precise arrangements, the on-a-dime shifts in meter, and the mouthfuls of lyrics required to service all those notes have, over the years, proven challenging to singers and musicians.&quot; Bacharach&#x27;s selection of instruments included flugelhorns, bossa nova sidesticks, breezy flutes, tack piano, &quot;molto fortissimo&quot; strings, and cooing female voices. According to editors of &quot;The Mojo Collection&quot;, it led to what became known as the &quot;Bacharach Sound&quot;. Bacharach explained:

While he did not mind singing during live performances, he sought mostly to avoid it on records. When he did sing, he explains, &quot;I [tried] to sing the songs not as a singer, but just interpreting it as a composer and interpreting a great lyric that Hal [David] wrote.&quot; When performing in front of live audiences, he often conducted while playing piano, as he did during a televised performance on &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;.

Bacharach wrote fifty-two US Top 40 hits. 

==Personal life==

Bacharach married four times. The first time was to Paula Stewart for five years (1953–1958). He was married to his second wife, actress Angie Dickinson, for 16 years (1965–1981), though they were separated the last five. They had one daughter, Lea Nikki Bacharach, who was born prematurely in 1966 and had Asperger syndrome. She committed suicide in 2007 after struggling with depression for many years.

Bacharach&#x27;s third marriage, to lyricist Carole Bayer Sager, spanned nine years (1982–1991). The duo collaborated on a number of musical pieces and adopted a son, Cristopher Elton Bacharach, in 1985.

Bacharach married his fourth wife, Jane Hansen, in 1993. They had two children, son Oliver, born the year before their marriage, and daughter Raleigh, born in 1995. 

Bacharach once owned the Dover House restaurant, which was located across the street from Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury, New York. It was the site of a press conference in which the New York Islanders unveiled their name and logo and introduced Bill Torrey as their first general manager.

Bacharach died of natural causes at his home in Los Angeles, California, on February 8, 2023, at the age of 94.

<text>Remy de Gourmont (4 April 1858 – 27 September 1915) was a French symbolist poet, novelist, and influential critic. He was widely read in his era, and an important influence on Blaise Cendrars and Georges Bataille. The spelling &quot;Rémy&quot; de Gourmont is incorrect, albeit common.

==Life==
Gourmont was born at Bazoches-au-Houlme, Orne, into a publishing family from Cotentin. He was the son of Count Auguste-Marie de Gourmont and his countess, born Mathilde de Montfort. In 1866 he moved to a manor close to Villedieu near La Manche. He studied law at Caen, and was awarded a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law in 1879; upon his graduation he moved to Paris.

In 1881, Gourmont was employed by the Bibliothèque nationale. He began to write for general circulation periodicals such as &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Contemporain&quot;. He took an interest in ancient literature, following the footsteps of Gustave Kahn. During this period, he also met Berthe Courrière, model for, and heir of, the sculptor Auguste Clésinger, with whom he formed a lifelong attachment, he and Berthe living together for the rest of their lives.

Gourmont also began a literary alliance with Joris-Karl Huysmans, to whom he dedicated his prose work &quot;Le Latin mystique&quot; (Mystical Latin). In 1889 Gourmont became one of the founders of the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, which became a rallying point of the Symbolist movement. Between 1893 and 1894 he was the co-editor, along with Alfred Jarry, of L&#x27;Ymagier, a magazine dedicated to symbolist wood carvings. In 1891 he published a polemic called &quot;Le Joujou Patriotisme&quot; (Patriotism, a toy) in which he argued that France and Germany shared an aesthetic culture and urged a rapprochement between the two countries, contrary to the wishes of nationalists in the French government. This political essay led to his losing his job at the Bibliothèque Nationale, despite Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s chronicles.
During this same period, Gourmont was stricken with lupus vulgaris. Disfigured by this illness, he largely retired from public view appearing only at the offices of the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;. In 1910, Gourmont met Natalie Clifford Barney, to whom he dedicated his &quot;Lettres à l&#x27;Amazone&quot; (Letters to the Amazon).

Gourmont&#x27;s health continued to decline and he began to suffer from locomotor ataxia and be increasingly unable to walk. He was deeply depressed by the outbreak of World War I and died in Paris of cerebral congestion in 1915. Berthe Courrière was his sole heir, inheriting a substantial body of unpublished work which she sent to his brother Jean de Gourmont, and dying within the year. Gourmont and Courrière are buried Chopins tomb in Père-Lachaise Cemetery.

==Works==
Gourmont was a literary critic and essayist of great importance, most notably his &quot;Le Problème du Style&quot;. Created in response to Antoine Albalat&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Writing in Twenty Lessons&quot; (1899), &quot;Le Problème du Style&quot; was a source book for many of the ideas that inspired the literary developments in both England and France and was also admired by T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound in that capacity.

His novels, in particular &quot;Sixtine&quot;, explore the theme of Schopenhauerian Idealism with its emphasis on individual subjectivity, as well as the Decadent relationship between sexuality and artistic creativity. In 1922 Aldous Huxley translated Gourmont&#x27;s novel &quot;A Virgin Heart&quot;.

Gourmont&#x27;s poetic works include &quot;Litanies de la Rose&quot; (1892), &quot;Les Saintes du Paradis&quot; (1898), and &quot;Divertissements&quot; (1912). His anthology &quot;Hieroglyphes&quot; (1894), contains his experiments with the possibilities of sound and rhythm. It plunges from perhaps ironic piety to equally ironic blasphemy, reflecting, more than anything else, his interest in medieval Latin literature, and his works led to a fad for late Latin literature among authors like Joris-Karl Huysmans. Pound observed in 1915 that the English Imagist poetic movement derived from the French Symbolistes, Eliot describing Gourmont as the &quot;critical conscience of his generation&quot;.

==Quotation==
:Que tes mains soient bénies, car elles sont impures!
:Elles ont des péchés cachés à toutes les jointures;
:Leur peau blanche s&#x27;est trempée dans l&#x27;odeur âpre des caresses
:Secrètes, parmi l&#x27;ombre blanche où rampent les caresses,
:Et l&#x27;opale prisonnière qui se meurt à ton doigt,
:C&#x27;est le dernier soupir de Jésus sur la croix.

<doc id="179330" wikidata="Q502967" url="?curid=179330" title="Art of Noise">
<text>Art of Noise (also The Art of Noise) were a British avant-garde synth-pop group formed in early 1983 by engineer/producer Gary Langan and programmer J. J. Jeczalik, along with keyboardist/arranger Anne Dudley, producer Trevor Horn, and music journalist Paul Morley. The group had international Top 20 hits with its interpretations of &quot;Kiss&quot;, featuring Tom Jones, and the instrumental &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, which won a 1986 Grammy Award.

The group&#x27;s mostly instrumental compositions were novel melodic sound collages based on digital sampler technology, which was new at the time. Inspired by turn-of-the-20th-century revolutions in music, the Art of Noise were initially packaged as a faceless anti- or non-group, blurring the distinction between the art and its creators. The band is noted for innovative use of electronics and computers in pop music, particularly its innovative use of sampling.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The technological impetus for the Art of Noise was the advent of the Fairlight CMI sampler. With the Fairlight, short digital sound recordings called samples could be played using a piano-like keyboard, while a computer processor altered such characteristics as pitch and timbre. Music producer Trevor Horn was among the early adopters of Fairlight. While some musicians were using samples as adornment in their works, Horn and his colleagues saw the potential to craft entire compositions with the sampler.

In 1981, Horn&#x27;s production team included programmer J. J. Jeczalik, engineer Gary Langan and keyboard player/string arranger Anne Dudley. The team produced ABC&#x27;s 1982 debut album &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot;, increasingly using the Fairlight to tweak live-based elements of performance but also to embellish the compositions with sound effects such as a cash register&#x27;s bell on &quot;Date Stamp&quot; (Dudley also co-wrote a track on the album, which launched her scoring career). The team also worked on Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Duck Rock&quot; and would go on to work with Frankie Goes to Hollywood on what would become the album &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; (realised predominantly on Fairlight).

During January 1983, Horn&#x27;s team were working on the Yes comeback album &quot;90125&quot; – Horn as producer, Langan as engineer, and Dudley and Jeczalik providing arrangements and keyboard programming. During the sessions, Jeczalik and Langan took a scrapped Alan White drum riff and sampled it into the Fairlight using the device&#x27;s Page R sequencer (the first time an entire drum pattern had been sampled into the machine). Jeczalik and Langan then added non-musical sounds on top of it, before playing the track to Horn. This in turn resulted in the Red &amp; Blue Mix of Yes&#x27;s &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; single, which showcased the prototype sound of The Art of Noise.

Seeing further potential in the idea, Horn teamed Jeczalik and Langan with Dudley in February to develop the project and brought in one of his business partners, ex-NME journalist Paul Morley, as a provider of concepts, art direction and marketing ideas. Morley came up with the project name (taken from the essay &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; by noted futurist Luigi Russolo, and finalised at Jeczalik&#x27;s request by dropping the final &#x27;s&#x27;). Much later, in a July 2002 article penned for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Morley wrote &quot;I loved the name Art of Noise so much that I forced my way into the group. If over the years people asked me what I did in the group, I replied that I named them, and it was such a great name, that was enough to justify my role. I was the Ringo Starr of Art of Noise. I made the tea. Oh, and I wrote the lyrics to one of the loveliest pieces of pop music ever, Moments in Love.&quot; Horn himself joined the new group as production advisor and provider of further ideas. This was the first time that he had been part of a group since parting company with his The Buggles&#x27; partner Geoff Downes (after they had been part of Yes). It would also be the first and last time that he would enjoy chart success as an artist since the new wave hit in 1979 with &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; (not counting writing credits on The Dollar Album).

===&quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Art of Noise?&quot; (1983–1984)===
The debut Art of Noise EP, &quot;Into Battle with the Art of Noise&quot;, appeared in September 1983 on Horn&#x27;s fledgling ZTT label. Many of the samples originally used on &quot;90125&quot; reappeared on the EP, which immediately scored a hit in the urban and alternative dance charts in the US with the highly percussive, cut-up instrumental track &quot;Beat Box&quot;, a favourite among body-poppers.

The first Art of Noise album, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Art of Noise?&quot; was released in 1984. During this period, the group presented themselves as faceless (using masks, minimal personal appearances, or even absence from promotion to indicate that the Art of Noise was not a standard rock or pop band which promoted and mythologised its members as individuals).

&quot;Moments in Love&quot;, a ten-minute instrumental ode to sensuality that appeared on both &quot;Into Battle&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid,&quot; was remixed and released as a single in 1985. The song was first released in the US in 1983, where it was a moderate hit on the US R&amp;B singles chart. It was played at one of Madonna&#x27;s weddings; sampled by Mýa in her hit single &quot;It&#x27;s All About Me,&quot; which featured Sisqó; used in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Pumping Iron II: The Women&quot;; featured in the Indian movie &quot;Koi...Mil Gaya&quot;; name-dropped in the opening pages of Sister Souljah&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Midnight and the Meaning of Love&quot; (as &quot;Moments of Love&quot;); interpolated in King Sun&#x27;s song “Hey, Love”; used in a number of advertisements; and remixed, covered, and sampled by numerous other artists. It has also appeared in numerous chill out compilations and has become a staple of smooth jazz radio station playlists. &quot;Moments in Love&quot; has been remixed many times, with names such as &quot;Moments in Bed&quot; and &quot;Moments in love 7&quot; Master Rejected&quot;. Most &quot;Moments in Love&quot; remixes can be found in the box set &quot;And What Have You Done with My Body, God?&quot;

An October 1984 feature in &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine indicated several of Morley and Horn&#x27;s plans for the group&#x27;s subsequent projects. These included a cover of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, originally by The Buggles (Horn and Geoff Downes); &quot;Raiding the 20th Century&quot;, an album using sounds from throughout the 20th century as source material; the score for &quot;The Living End&quot;, a film written by Morley and directed by Godley &amp; Creme; and the soundtrack for a ballet.

&quot;Close (to the Edit)&quot; was issued in October that year. The single was Art of Noise&#x27;s first major UK hit, reaching number eight in the UK Singles Chart in November 1984.

===Split of original line-up (1985)===
In 1985, Dudley, Jeczalik, and Langan made an acrimonious split from Morley and Horn as well as from the ZTT label.

In a post-split interview for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in October 1985, Jeczalik indicated that he and Morley did not get along and that he felt Morley&#x27;s writing was pretentious. Jeczalik responded to a question about the level of Morley and Horn&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid&quot; by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to tell. We say approximately 1.73 percent, but it could even be as high as two percent. You see, all that has happened is that Gary and I started something, it was taken away, and we have taken steps to get it back.&quot; In the same interview, Dudley indicated she felt parts of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid&quot; were of dubious quality.

Much later, Morley would comment &quot;When Trevor and I left, (Jeczalik, Langan and Dudley) became a novelty group who had hits with Tom Jones.&quot; His disdain for the artistic direction of The Art of Noise once he was no longer involved with it was even more evident in other articles he penned, including the liner notes of the 1986 compilation album &quot;Daft&quot; (under the name Otto Flake) and a September 2002 article for &quot;The Observer&quot;.

===&quot;In Visible Silence&quot; (1986)===

After the split, Dudley, Jeczalik, and Langan moved to the UK-based China Records label, taking the Art of Noise name with them. Some of the band&#x27;s original imagery and ethos was retained for their second album, &quot;In Visible Silence&quot;. This album spawned the Grammy Award-winning cover of the &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; theme, recorded with Duane Eddy, who had a hit with &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; in 1959. The Art of Noise collaboration reached number two on the Billboard dance charts. The &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; video featured comedian Rik Mayall in a parody of the private eye film genre. The piece would later be used as the theme music for the 2008 BBC TV series &quot;Bill Oddie&#x27;s Wild Side&quot;.

From the same album, the &quot;Beat Box&quot;-like single &quot;Legs&quot; (using the same drum sounds) was a mild underground hit in dance clubs. In 1986, the album track &quot;Paranoimia&quot; achieved some success when a remix of it was released as a single with overdubbed vocal samples provided by Matt Frewer as the supposedly computer-generated character Max Headroom. Frewer also appeared as Max Headroom in the music video for the track.

Around 1986, Jeczalik and Dudley started appearing in photographs without masks, alienating some fans that had come to appreciate Morley&#x27;s &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; aesthetic. The upcoming soundtrack pieces continued The Art of Noise&#x27;s evolution into a pop band and away from Morley&#x27;s faceless &quot;non-group.&quot;

===&quot;In No Sense? Nonsense!&quot;, &quot;Below the Waste&quot;, and the split (1987–1990)===

By 1987, the band&#x27;s membership was down to just Jeczalik and Dudley. That year saw the release of their album &quot;In No Sense? Nonsense!&quot;  The album featured Jeczalik&#x27;s most advanced rhythmic collages to date, plus lush string arrangements, pieces for boys&#x27; choir, and keyboard melodies from Dudley. It did not produce any hits, although their record label made efforts to push remixes of &quot;Dragnet&quot; into the dance clubs and the single reached No. 60 on the UK Singles Chart.

In 1987, The Art of Noise provided the score for two movies, &quot;Hiding Out&quot; and &quot;Dragnet&quot;, and one particular movement was used in both films. Their brass-based connecting passage between sections from the original Dragnet television show&#x27;s theme song was used as incidental music during a dramatic scene—an armed chase through the rafters of a gymnasium—near the end of &quot;Hiding Out&quot;.

In 1988, a one-off collaboration with singer Tom Jones (a cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Kiss&quot; – a staple in Jones&#x27; stage shows) renewed the public&#x27;s interest in the Art of Noise and provided the group&#x27;s biggest hit in the mainstream. The track appeared on several albums by Jones, and China Records included the song on the greatest hits compilation &quot;The Best of The Art of Noise&quot;, the first edition of which also contained tracks licensed from ZTT.

The follow-up album, &quot;Below the Waste&quot;, failed to achieve much success upon its release in 1989. It did spawn the memorable single &quot;Yebo!&quot; (featuring the unique vocals of Zulu performers Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens). Both cassette and CD versions include two bonus tracks in the form of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, and the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;.

In 1990, Dudley and Jeczalik declared that the Art of Noise had officially disbanded.

===Interim (compilations, failed reformations and solo work)===
Although Dudley and Jeczalik had already dissolved the group, in 1990 they assisted in the promotion of the lightly remixed compilation &quot;The Ambient Collection&quot;, which the China label released to cash in on the burgeoning ambient house scene. Jeczalik approved the remixes that appeared on &quot;The FON Mixes&quot; the following year. The rest of the decade saw China Records releasing further Art of Noise compilations: &quot;The Drum and Bass Collection&quot;, &quot;Art Works&quot;, and reissues of &quot;Best of&quot; without the ZTT-era tracks. Some of these featured new remixes by other artists.

According to an interview with J.J. Jeczalik reported in the ZTT fanzine &quot;Outside World&quot; in 1991, Jeczalik, Dudley and Langan were inspired by the commercial success of &quot;The FON Mixes&quot; and had discussed reuniting the group as a trio again. In preparation to record a new album, Jeczalik and Langan travelled to Cuba to gather new source material. However, no new recordings were produced with the new line-up, and the Art of Noise remained defunct.

Dudley became well known for composing numerous film and television scores during the 1990s. The most famous of these is probably &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, which won an Academy Award for Original Music Score. She also collaborated with Killing Joke&#x27;s Jaz Coleman on the 1990 album &quot;Songs from the Victorious City&quot; (inspired by a trip the two made to Egypt) and produced two tracks for the 1993 Deborah Harry album &quot;Debravation&quot; (&quot;Strike Me Pink&quot;, which she also co-wrote and played keyboards on, and &quot;Mood Ring&quot;). She has scored orchestrations for dozens of pop releases over the years, and both scored and produced the album &quot;Voice&quot; for her neighbour Alison Moyet. Cathy Dennis added lyrics to one of Dudley&#x27;s compositions and recorded it as &quot;Too Many Walls&quot;, which became a US Top 10 hit in 1991.

In 1995–1997, Jeczalik and &quot;In No Sense? Nonsense!&quot; coengineer Bob Kraushaar produced a number of instrumentals oriented toward dance clubs under the name Art of Silence, issuing an album titled &quot;artofsilence.co.uk&quot;. Jeczalik also embarked on a new career in trading in futures contracts.

The Art of Noise also received a full writing credit for The Prodigy&#x27;s &quot;Firestarter&quot;, which samples the female &quot;hey, hey&quot; voice from &quot;Close to the Edit&quot;. The Prodigy also contributed the remix &quot;Instruments of Darkness (All of Us are One People)&quot; to the 1991 compilation &quot;The FON Mixes&quot;. Also, an edited version of &quot;Close to the Edit&quot; is featured on the monthly educational Amiga game &quot;Ready Robot Club&quot;. The Art of Noise are also credited for the music to the ITV series &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;.

===The reunion and &quot;The Seduction of Claude Debussy&quot; (1998–2000)===
In 1998, Horn, Morley, and Dudley began talking about the original intent of the project, its relevance in 20th-century music, and the impending turn of a new century. The group temporarily reformed, adding guitarist Lol Creme, but without J.J. Jeczalik and Gary Langan. Their engineering, programming and production tasks were carried out by dance act Way Out West. An album was recorded – &quot;Balance – Music for the Eye&quot; – but was never released, although several tracks from this project were included on the 2010 retrospective album &quot;Influence&quot;. and the whole album was released as part of &quot;At the End of the Century&quot; box set. Instead, a new single called &quot;Dream On&quot; – which featured remixed versions of the forthcoming album track &quot;Dreaming in Colour&quot; – was released to club DJs later in 1998, showcasing mixes by Way Out West.

A second single, &quot;Metaforce&quot;, featuring a rap by Rakim, preceded the 1999 release of the concept album &quot;The Seduction of Claude Debussy&quot;, a cohesive concept album depicting the life and works of Claude Debussy, on the ZTT label.

This album later formed the basis of a 17-minute soundtrack for London&#x27;s Millennium fireworks celebrations on the banks of the River Thames. The firework display was synchronised to an edit of &quot;Seduction&quot; which also featured a collage of samples from some of Britain&#x27;s most famous pop and rock songs, plus classical composers. It was broadcast live on 95.8 Capital FM and BBC London 94.9. Trevor Horn worked on the project with Jill Sinclair, Bob Geldof, Capital Radio executive Clive Dickens and producer Ross Ford.

After performing a handful of live shows in the UK and US, the band dissolved. A DVD (&quot;Into Vision&quot;) and CD (&quot;Reconstructed&quot;) were released in 2002 and 2003 respectively, featuring music recorded and filmed in Chicago, at the Coachella Festival (10 September 1999), at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire (22 March 2000) and Fountain Studios, Wembley, London (1 June 2000).

===Later work===
A reunion of sorts occurred at a 30 November 2013 live performance by the BBC Concert Orchestra (with a live BBC radio broadcast) including Dudley&#x27;s orchestral arrangement of the band&#x27;s EP &quot;Into Battle&quot; and a new piece entitled &quot;Rhythm of a Decade&quot; by Dudley and narrated by Morley. In their programme notes, they explain &quot;Rhythm of a Decade&quot; was inspired by an unreleased Art of Noise piece: &quot;Of the many Art of Noise albums that did not appear – even if they were recorded – was one that set out to represent various decades through the rhythms that appeared during that particular decade – charting the development of rhythmical patterns and the physical changes in drum sounds throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s&quot;.

 On 25 May 2017 Art of Noise members Langan, Dudley and Jeczalik reunited as Reboot Art of Noise, performing at Liverpool Sound City as special support for The Human League during the festival&#x27;s Pioneers of British Electronic Music.

The three appeared again when they played highlights from their &quot;In Visible Silence&quot; album plus other career highlights as &quot;Dudley, Jeczalik, Langan&quot; at the British Library in London on 9 March 2018 as part of the library&#x27;s &quot;Season of Sound&quot; celebrating 140 years of recorded sound. This performance included a recorded video intro and outro from Paul Morley.

Most recently, Jeczalik and Langan have been performing intermittent live dates as The Art of Noise/Revision/VJ Set, with a four-person line-up also including video operator Ian Peel (a long-term Art of Noise chronicler) and Chilean musician/producer Raimundo Ladrón de Guevara (and following &quot;very good-humoured discussions and input from Trevor Horn, Anne Dudley and Paul Morley&quot;).

===Re-releases===
In 2003, a 20th-anniversary edition of &quot;Into Battle&quot; was released the first time in CD form in Germany, including bonus tracks and a bonus DVD of their promo videos and a selected discography slideshow of album art. The CD substituted the original version of &quot;Beat Box&quot; with the later &quot;Diversion One&quot;.

In early 2004, the Karvavena label released an Art of Noise tribute album, &quot;The Abduction of The Art of Noise&quot;. This album contains covers of various tracks, including a new version of &quot;Beat Box&quot; performed by J.J. Jeczalik under his Art of Silence moniker. 2004 saw Dudley and Horn perform &quot;Close (To the Edit)&quot; together at a The Prince&#x27;s Trust charity event.

In 2006, Lol Creme and Trevor Horn formed Producers, a band made up of record producers and musicians. Gary Langan is the band&#x27;s audio engineer.

21 August 2006 saw ZTT release a 4-CD Art of Noise box set, titled &quot;And What Have You Done with My Body, God?&quot;, which consisted of tracks exclusively from the 1983–85 ZTT era, from the initial tentative demos created by Gary Langan and J.J. Jeczalik in the wake of the Yes &quot;90125&quot; sessions, to selections from the Ambassadors Theatre performances featuring Horn and Morley, recorded at concerts profiling ZTT acts—prior to which, Langan, Jeczalik, and Dudley had abandoned the label (and, for the time being, the band). The set featured over 40 unreleased remixes, demos, and works in progress, as well as the complete vinyl version of &quot;Into Battle...&quot; – sourced from the original masters – for the first time on CD. The project was conceived, researched and compiled by music journalist (and Art of Noise aficionado) Ian Peel, who also wrote the box set&#x27;s accompanying 36-page book, which featured new interviews with all of the original members.

In April 2011, Peel continued his archiving of classic and vaulted ZTT material, now named the Element Series, with a Deluxe Edition reissue of &quot;Into Battle with the Art of Noise&quot;. This was intended to be the first of a chronological remastering and repackaging of the Art of Noise&#x27;s output, collating the original album or EP with extended and previously unavailable tracks. &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Art of Noise?&quot;, considered the first &#x27;true&#x27; AON album, was released as a Deluxe Edition on 19 September 2011.

In May 2017, a two-disc deluxe edition of &quot;In Visible Silence&quot; was released. Included is the remastered album, along with several remixes and B-sides, taken from previous 12&quot; singles and available on CD for the first time. Also included are outtakes and unreleased material from the group&#x27;s time with China Records. Shortly thereafter, a similar deluxe edition of their next album, &quot;In No Sense? Nonsense!&quot; was released.

===Other work===
The Art of Noise wrote and recorded the theme music to the popular British game show &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;, which was used from 1986 to 1993; the group also composed the short music pieces that introduced each of the six rounds. The group also composed and performed the opening theme for the third series of the chat show &quot;The Max Headroom Show&quot;. The track, titled &quot;Happy Harry&#x27;s High Club&quot; (after a phrase spoken by Max Headroom on &quot;Paranoimia&quot;), is featured on &quot;In Visible Silence&quot;.

<text>John William Ferrell (; born July 16, 1967) is an American actor, comedian, writer, and producer. He is known for his leading man roles in comedy films and for his work as a television producer. Ferrell has earned six Emmy Awards and in 2011 was honored with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. In 2015, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was named the best comedian in British &quot;GQ&quot;.

Ferrell first established himself in the mid-1990s as a cast member on the sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he performed from 1995 to 2002, and has subsequently starred in a string of comedy films. After starring in the 2003 comedy film &quot;Old School,&quot; Ferrell became considered a member of the &quot;Frat Pack&quot;, a generation of leading Hollywood comic actors who emerged in the late 1990s and the 2000s, including Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell, Vince Vaughn, Paul Rudd, and brothers Owen and Luke Wilson. He founded the comedy website Funny or Die in 2007 with his former writing partner Adam McKay.

Ferrell starred in comedy films such as &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998), &quot;Elf&quot; (2003), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot; (2005), &quot;Talladega Nights&quot; (2006), &quot;Blades of Glory&quot; (2007), &quot;Step Brothers&quot; (2008), &quot;The Other Guys&quot; (2010), &quot;Get Hard&quot; (2015), and &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023).

For his work on Broadway he received a Tony Award nomination for Best Special Theatrical Event for his satirical portrayal as George W. Bush in &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome America&quot; (2009).

==Early life and education==
John William Ferrell was born on July 16, 1967, in Irvine, California, to Betty Kay (née Overman; born 1940), a teacher who taught at Old Mill School elementary school and Santa Ana College, and Roy Lee Ferrell Jr. (born 1941), who played saxophone and keyboards for the Righteous Brothers. His parents were both natives of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina. They moved to California in 1964. Ferrell&#x27;s ancestry includes English, German, and Irish. As an infant Ferrell suffered from pyloric stenosis and had a pyloromyotomy to correct the condition. He has a younger brother, Patrick.

When he was eight years old, his parents divorced. Ferrell said of the divorce: &quot;I was the type of kid who would say, &#x27;Hey, look at the bright side! We&#x27;ll have two Christmases&#x27;.&quot; The divorce was amicable, and both parents were committed to their children. The biggest problem was his father&#x27;s line of work. As a person in show business, his paychecks were never steady, and he traveled from home for months at a time. Growing up in this environment made Ferrell not want to go into show business and instead have a steady job.

Ferrell first attended school at Culverdale Elementary and later attended Rancho San Joaquin Middle School, both in Irvine. He attended University High School in Irvine, and was a kicker for the school&#x27;s varsity football team. He was also on the soccer team and captain of the basketball team, as well as serving on the student council. Ferrell called third grade &quot;a pivotal year.&quot; He realized he could make his classmates laugh if he pretended to smash his head against the wall, or if he tripped and fell on purpose, and said it was a great way to make friends. He said the dullness of Irvine contributed to the growth of his humor:

In his senior year of high school, Ferrell and a friend would perform comedy skits over the school&#x27;s intercom system, with cooperation from the principal; the two had to write their own material. Ferrell also performed comedic skits in the school&#x27;s talent shows. He was voted &quot;Best Personality&quot; by his classmates. He enrolled at the University of Southern California, where he studied sports broadcasting and joined the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. In college, he was known for a few pranks. On occasion, he would dress in a janitor&#x27;s outfit and stroll into his friends&#x27; classes. He was also known for streaking around campus with a few other people from the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. Ferrell earned an internship at a local television station in the sports department, but he did not enjoy the work.

After graduating with a B.A. degree in sports information in 1990, he knew he did not want to do broadcasting. He took up a job as a hotel valet where, on his second day, he tore a baggage rack off the top of a van by trying to drive it under a low beam. He also worked as a teller at Wells Fargo, but came up short $300 the first day and $280 the second; he was not stealing the money, but was just careless and error-prone. In 1991, encouraged by his mother to pursue something he liked, Ferrell moved to Los Angeles. He successfully auditioned for the comedy group The Groundlings where he spent time developing his improvisation skills.

==Career==
=== 1994–2001: &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; ===
Before joining The Groundlings, Ferrell&#x27;s attempts at standup comedy had little success. He started in the advanced classes and grew to love improvisation. He realized he also liked to impersonate people, and one of his favorites was Harry Caray, the Hall of Fame baseball announcer. Soon he began to create original characters, and by 1994 he had joined The Groundlings. With fellow Groundlings member Chris Kattan, he created the Butabi Brothers, who go out to dance clubs to try to pick up women but are constantly rejected. While taking classes, Ferrell got a job at an auction house via his friend Viveca Paulin. The job was ideal as it was flexible enough for him to audition and go to rehearsals while also being employed. By 1995 he was receiving small roles, including appearances in TV series &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; and &quot;Living Single&quot;, low-budget films such as &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot;, as well as commercials. One winter, he served as a mall Santa Claus.

After SNL&#x27;s decline in popularity in 1994–1995, and in need of new cast members for the next season, a producer saw &quot;The Groundlings&quot; and asked Ferrell, Kattan, and Cheri Oteri to audition for SNL&#x27;s main producer, Lorne Michaels. Ferrell joined &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1995 and left in 2002 after a seven-year tenure. He has hosted the show five times, thereby becoming a member of the show&#x27;s Five Timers Club.

During his time on &quot;SNL&quot;, Ferrell made a name for himself with his impersonations, which included US President George W. Bush, Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray, singer Robert Goulet (crooning a cappella pieces of music by Sisqó, Baha Men, and The Notorious B.I.G.), singer Neil Diamond, &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; host James Lipton (who favored Ferrell&#x27;s impersonation), Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, United States Attorney General Janet Reno, convicted Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, game show host Alex Trebek, fictitious private detective John Shaft, professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, US Vice President Al Gore, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and Cuban President Fidel Castro.

His original characters included &quot;Morning Latte&quot; co-host Tom Wilkins, Mister Ed the Horse&#x27;s twin brother Ned, fictional Blue Öyster Cult member Gene Frenkle (physically modeled after the band&#x27;s vocalist Eric Bloom), music teacher Marty Culp, cheerleader Craig Buchanan, Dale Sturtevant from &quot;Dissing Your Dog&quot;, Hank of the Bill Brasky Buddies, David Leary from &quot;Dog Show&quot;, angry and inattentive Dr. Beaman and night clubber Steve Butabi in sketches that were turned into a feature film in 1998&#x27;s &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot;. Although a one-shot character, one of Ferrell&#x27;s most memorable &quot;SNL&quot; characters is Dale McGrew, a &quot;highly patriotic&quot; office worker who comes to work wearing a half t-shirt and short shorts that Ferrell improvised into a thong just before the skit aired live, leading to genuine laughter from the cast and guest host Seann William Scott. Ferrell became the highest paid cast member of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2001 with a season salary of $350,000. Ferrell returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a guest host on May 14, 2005; May 16, 2009; May 12, 2012; January 27, 2018, and November 23, 2019. For the first two hosting appearances, he reprised his role as Alex Trebek in the &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy&quot; sketches. On the May 14 appearance, Ferrell reprised his role as Robert Goulet in a fake commercial advertising a series of ringtones and, during the performance of the song &quot;Little Sister&quot; by musical guests Queens of the Stone Age, Ferrell came on stage playing the cowbell.

=== 2002–2010: Film stardom ===

During his time on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Ferrell appeared in several movies: &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997), &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998), &quot;Superstar&quot; (1999), &quot;The Ladies Man&quot; (2000), &quot;Dick&quot; (1999), &quot;Drowning Mona&quot; (2000), &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), and &quot;Zoolander&quot; (2001). His first starring role after his departure from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; was as Frank &quot;The Tank&quot; Richard in &quot;Old School&quot; (2003). The film &quot;belongs to Mr. Ferrell,&quot; declared &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which described how he &quot;uses his hilarious, anxious zealotry to sell the part.&quot; &quot;Old School&quot; was a success and Ferrell received an MTV Movie Awards nomination for Best Comedic Performance.

The title role in &quot;Elf&quot; (2003) followed, as did another MTV Movie Awards nomination. Ferrell continued to land comedy roles in 2004 and 2005 in films such as &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; earning himself a place among Hollywood&#x27;s Frat Pack. In 2005, Ferrell earned . In 2006, Ferrell starred in &quot;Stranger Than Fiction, Curious George,&quot; and &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot;. Both received critical and box office success. Ferrell&#x27;s performance in &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; introduced audiences to the dramatic potential of Ferrell&#x27;s acting talents, while &quot;Talladega Nights&quot; was his highest grossing live-action opening as of 2010 at $47 million. On , 2006, &quot;The Magazine&quot; named Ferrell as one of its three actors of the year in their 2006 year in review issue. A sequel to Anchorman, &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot;, was released in 2013.

In 2008, Ferrell starred in the movie &quot;Step Brothers&quot; with John C. Reilly. The movie also starred Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, Mary Steenburgen, and Richard Jenkins. It was directed by frequent Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay, who was also a co-writer of the movie. The movie earned $128 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews but has since become a cult classic. Chris Hewitt of &quot;Empire&quot; praised the chemistry of two leads writing, &quot;Ferrell and Reilly are a superb double-act, Reilly&#x27;s cockiness meshing well with Ferrell&#x27;s puppy dog innocence. They&#x27;re fine separately, but when the two are together, be it during an extended fight scene with a bunch of kids, or a demented sleepwalking sequence, the movie is a blast.&quot;
Ferrell is also known for his promotional appearances including acting as part of a pre-game video package for the Rose Bowl along with University of Texas at Austin alum Matthew McConaughey. Ferrell sang a song at the ESPY Awards in 2006 about Lance Armstrong and Neil Armstrong. He and John C. Reilly performed a spot during the 2008 ESPY Awards within which they made demands in order for them to appear at the ESPYs, such as asking Portland Trail Blazers&#x27; center Greg Oden to tuck them in at night and tell them stories of the old times or to bring back the Cold War so the Olympics can be interesting again. Ferrell has worked as a voice actor in several animated television programs and films, including his portrayal of Bob Oblong, a 1950s-style father with no arms or legs, in the short-lived animated television series &quot;The Oblongs&quot; which ran on The WB and Adult Swim.

He has had several guest appearances on &quot;Family Guy&quot; where he played the Black Knight in &quot;Mr. Saturday Knight&quot;, as well as Fat Greek Guy and Miles &quot;Chatterbox&quot; Musket in &quot;Fifteen Minutes of Shame&quot;. He had a recurring cameo role as Bitch Hunter in the sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot;. Ferrell also starred as Ted (a.k.a. The Man in the Yellow Hat) in the film &quot;Curious George&quot; and guest voiced on an episode of the FOX sitcom &quot;King of the Hill&quot; as a politically correct soccer coach. He voiced the title character in the 2010 DreamWorks Animation feature film &quot;Megamind&quot; (replacing both Robert Downey Jr., who dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, and Ben Stiller, who also turned down the role and was instead cast in a minor role as Bernard the curator) as well as President Business in &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, released in 2014. He reprised the latter role in &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot;, released in 2019.

Ferrell has presented numerous times at the Academy Awards. He sang a humorous song &quot;Get Off the Stage&quot; with Jack Black in 2004 and sang a song about comedies being snubbed by the voters in favor of dramas John C. Reilly and Jack Black in 2007.

In 2010, he was the executive producer and star of &quot;The Other Guys&quot;, a buddy cop film which also has an ensemble cast including Mark Wahlberg, Eva Mendes, Michael Keaton, Steve Coogan, Ray Stevenson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Dwayne Johnson. The film was a commercial success earning over $140 million and was positively reviewed by critics.

Ferrell appeared in the 2011 music video for &quot;Make Some Noise&quot; by the Beastie Boys, in the front of a limo playing a cowbell. He stars in &quot;Casa de Mi Padre&quot;, a telenovela spoof comedy set in a ranch with Mexican stars Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal. The movie is told in melodramatic telenovela form and features English-language subtitles.

Ferrell and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, who have had a long-running joke feud over their similar appearance appeared on the May 22, 2014 episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; for a charity drum-off battle. Despite Smith clearly giving the better performance, Ferrell was named the winner and awarded a giant gold cowbell. Both were joined by Smith&#x27;s Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmates for a performance of &quot;Don&#x27;t Fear the Reaper&quot;, with Ferrell playing cowbell. On June 10, 2014, Ferrell and Smith challenged Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich to a drum-off with Ferrell, saying Ulrich looks &quot;eerily similar&quot; to the two of them. Ulrich accepted the challenge two days later.

In 2015, he starred in the buddy comedy &quot;Get Hard&quot; and the comedy &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot;, with the latter reuniting him and &quot;The Other Guys&quot; co-star Mark Wahlberg. He reprised his role, Jacobim Mugatu, in the &quot;Zoolander&quot; sequel, &quot;Zoolander 2&quot; (2016).

In February 2019, Ferrell launched &quot;The Ron Burgundy Podcast&quot; in collaboration with the iHeart Radio Podcast Network. The show was originally slated for two seasons of twelve episodes each. In 2022, the podcast was renewed for a fifth live season. In October 2019, Ferrell partnered with iHeart Radio to launch his own podcast network, the Big Money Players Network.

The two take a road trip to rediscover each other.

==Other ventures==
In April 2007, Ferrell and Adam McKay launched &quot;Funny or Die&quot;, a streaming video website where short comedy films are uploaded and voted on by users. One of the featured shorts, &quot;The Landlord&quot;, stars Ferrell as a man harassed for the rent by his landlady, a swearing, beer-loving, two-year-old girl, played by McKay&#x27;s own daughter, Pearl. Child psychologists have criticized Ferrell and the McKay family for child exploitation, to which McKay responded, &quot;Fortunately she is in this great stage now where she repeats anything you say to her and then forgets it right away, which is key. She has not said the &#x27;B-word&#x27; since we shot the thing.&quot;
They followed with the release of a video entitled &quot;Good Cop, Baby Cop&quot; which also starred baby Pearl; the end of the video stated that this would be her final appearance and wished her a happy &quot;baby retirement&quot;.

In 2019, Ferrell ended his personal and professional relationship with Adam McKay and closed their production company, Gary Sanchez Productions. It was later revealed the reason for the split was due to the fact that McKay cast John C. Reilly as Jerry Buss on the show &quot;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&quot;, a role that Ferrell wanted, without letting Ferrell know.

==Personal life==
In August 2000, Ferrell married Swedish actress Viveca Paulin, whom he met in 1995 at an acting class. They live in New York City and Orange County, California, and have three sons, born in 2004, 2006, and 2010.
At USC, Ferrell was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity and is now an active alumnus. Ferrell has worked with former head coach Pete Carroll to do motivational stunts for the players during the season.

Ferrell has run multiple marathons, including the Boston, New York, and Stockholm marathons. He also raises money for charity, including his Scholarships for Cancer Survivors campaign, through a micro-donations fundraising platform.

In 2007, &quot;Autograph&quot; magazine named Ferrell the worst celebrity autographer. Its editor stated: &quot;What&#x27;s so frustrating about Will Ferrell being the worst autograph signer this past year is that he used to be so nice to fans and collectors and a great signer. What makes him so bad is that he&#x27;ll taunt people asking for his autograph.&quot; In response, Ferrell stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how I got on the list. I sign a lot of autographs.&quot; He has, however, admitted to taunting autograph-seekers: &quot;I do. I really do. I&#x27;m like, &#x27;How badly do you want this autograph?&#x27; &#x27;Are you sure?&#x27; &#x27;You say you&#x27;re my biggest fan, really, prove it.&#x27; I&#x27;ll do things like that. They have to earn it.&quot;

Ferrell appeared on an episode of &quot;Man vs. Wild&quot; in which he traveled throughout the tundras of Sweden with the show&#x27;s host, Bear Grylls. In the episode, Ferrell came across various unique situations, such as eating the eye of a reindeer.

On May 12, 2017, Ferrell was awarded an honorary D.H.L. degree by the University of Southern California.

On April 13, 2018, Ferrell was involved in a serious two-car collision in California. The SUV he was a passenger in flipped over during the crash. Ferrell was one of three passengers in the car.

He was released from the hospital shortly after said to be &quot;doing fine.&quot;

=== Political views ===
Ferrell is a supporter of the Democratic Party and in 2018, canvassed on behalf of the party in the state of Georgia.

Ferrell had noted that, though he was well known for his &quot;SNL&quot; impersonation of President George W. Bush, he chose, for both professional and political reasons, not to meet the president on several occasions. Unlike his &quot;SNL&quot; predecessor Dana Carvey&#x27;s famous relationship with George H. W. Bush, Ferrell has said: &quot;I declined, partly out of comedic purposes, because when I was on the show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the time, it didn&#x27;t make sense to really meet the people that you play, for fear of them influencing you. And then the other side of it is, from a political standpoint, I don&#x27;t want to meet that guy.&quot;

In August 2012, while in Australia promoting &quot;The Campaign&quot;, Ferrell made a guest appearance on the Network 10 live panel news/comedy show &quot;The Project&quot;. He found himself speaking via video link to Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during which they had a light-hearted conversation about hairdressing.

Ferrell supported Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election and met him (along with his wife, Michelle) in 2011.

In February 2013, Ferrell endorsed Eric Garcetti for mayor of Los Angeles.

On May 6, 2010, at a Minor League Baseball game at Dell Diamond in Round Rock, Texas, Ferrell was introduced between innings as a Venezuelan pitcher for the Round Rock Express named &quot;Billy Ray &#x27;RoJo&#x27; Johnson&quot;. Wearing a false mustache and carrying a bag of beer cans to the mound, Ferrell threw one pitch and was ejected after a staged fight and chase with an opposing batter. He revealed himself to the fans when his moustache fell off during the chase. A video of the skit went viral. The appearance was cooked up by Ferrell and the Express, who sent out a press release announcing Johnson&#x27;s &quot;signing&quot; to promote a charity golf outing the following day at a nearby country club.

Ferrell played in five games of Major League Baseball spring training on March 12, 2015, for ten different Cactus League teams as a promotion for a Funny or Die charity special. He played for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres, Cincinnati Reds, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, and the San Francisco Giants, playing all ten positions (including designated hitter). According to Baseball-Reference, Ferrell faced and retired one batter – pitching on behalf of the Dodgers and ending with a 0.00 earned run average. The memorabilia from his one-day professional baseball career was sold and the proceeds donated to two cancer charities. Ferrell went 0–2 with two strikeouts that day but managed to foul off a fastball from the Giants&#x27; Jean Machi.

Ice hockey

Ferrell is an avid fan of the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL) and frequently partners with the club and attends games while seated in the front row. Ferrell has produced several video messages which the Kings have aired on the jumbotron during games throughout the years.

Ferrell has taken an active role in the Kings&#x27; fandom. During the 2023 playoffs matchups between the Kings and Edmonton Oilers, Ferrell appeared in his usual front row seats donning checkered faceprint in the Kings&#x27; colors, which circulated and drew parodies around the NHL.

In a March 21, 2019 game between the Kings and San Jose Sharks, Ferrell commentated the entire second period of the match on the local television broadcast in-character as Ron Burgundy. For the 2023–24 NHL season, Kings goaltender Cam Talbot, although himself not a member of the team at the time of the broadcast, bore a depiction of Burgundy in reference to the event.

Soccer

Ferrell took part in Soccer Aid 2012. In 2016, he became a part-owner of Los Angeles FC, which competes in Major League Soccer. When asked about why he became a co-owner Ferrell said &quot;I don&#x27;t really have a side per se until LAFC get started and that will definitely be, obviously, my team. But I just enough watching the fact that it&#x27;s played all over the world. So many amazing players and so many top flight leagues. And hopefully MLS can be on par, eventually, with the European leagues.&quot;

Over his career Ferrell has received various awards nominations including sixteen Primetime Emmy Award nominations winning three awards, one for &quot;Succession&quot; (2020), and twice for &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience&quot; (2019, 2020).
Ferrell received two Golden Globe Award nominations for his comedian performances in &quot;The Producers&quot; (2005), and &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot; (2006). He also received a Tony Award nomination for Best Special Theatrical Event for &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome America. A Final Night with George W Bush&quot; (2009).

Ferrell also has received various honors including the James Joyce Award from the University College Dublin&#x27;s Literary and Historical Society in recognition for &quot;excelling in his field&quot; in 2008. In 2011 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Ferrell received the prize at a ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts where he was honored by fellow comedians and collaborators Conan O&#x27;Brien, John C. Reilly, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Paul Rudd, Adam McKay, Tim Meadows, Matthew Broderick, and Ed Asner. In 2015, Ferrell received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in motion pictures.

In 2022, Los Angeles F.C. of Major League Soccer (MLS) – of which Ferrell is part owner – won the MLS Cup, thus giving him an MLS championship to his credit.

<text>Age Concern is the banner title used by several charitable organisations specifically concerned with the needs and interests of all older people (defined as those over the age of 50) based chiefly in the four countries of the United Kingdom.

In addition to providing practical support to individuals, Age Concern campaigns on issues such as age discrimination and pensions, influence public opinion and government policy about older people.

Numerous Age Concern organisations have been established throughout the UK, working at national and local levels. At the national level, four Age Concern organisations covered England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Local Age Concerns vary from small village groups to countywide organisations. In England, over 370 of the individual charities were members of a national federation. Although each was a separately registered charity working under the Age Concern banner, the federation allowed members to collaborate at local, regional, and national levels, to share resources, expertise, and influence.

Similar organisations also exist in New Zealand, Spain, Ukraine, and elsewhere under similar banners.

There was a merger of Age Concern England and Help the Aged, and somewhat later Age UK took over the mantle of the national face of concern for the aged in the UK, and several local organisations have also adopted the new name, but many local organisations continued to operate as local Age Concerns. One of these was Age Concern Manchester, and other examples are Age Concern Luton and Age Concern Central Lancashire.

==History==

Age Concern&#x27;s origins are in the United Kingdom and can be traced back to a realisation in that country of the effects on aged people of the Second World War; the dislocation and breakdown of family life arising out of conscription led to a recognition that existing poor laws failed to provide effective support for old people separated from family support networks.

In 1940, the Old People&#x27;s Welfare Committee (OPWC), chaired by Eleanor Rathbone, was formed as a forum for discussion between government and voluntary organisations. OPWC was a sub-committee of the Liverpool Personal Service Society (PSS). In 1944, the committee changed its name to the National Old People&#x27;s Welfare Committee (NOPWC) and took on responsibility for coordinating the activities of numerous local OPWCs.

From the 1950s onwards, NOPWC accessed government and local funds associated with the post-war development of the welfare state, to provide services to local committees, and training to wardens of old people&#x27;s homes.

In 1968 it became clear to Denise Newman. the then chairman of the NOPW council, an organisation funded within the government and run by unaccountable grandees was not an effective voice for the needs of the elderly. At that time the funding allocated from the government through the Department of Social Services was £40,000 a year.

One problem was that the minister responsible (Dick Crossman) was not in a position politically to guarantee that should the group break with the government that the funds would naturally follow to the new entity. So it was the taking of this funding risk which initially marked out Age Concern as part of a new way of dealing with what could be seen as a government-supported charitable exercise. Secondly, having successfully established itself with its premises and retained its £40,000 grant, Newman then insisted that the newly appointed CEO be salaried, and therefore accountable. This was the first salaried appointment of the senior executive of any charity in the UK.

In 1971, under the new direction of David Hobman, the NOPWC changed its public name to Age Concern, and separated itself from the government and the National Council for Social Service, now NCVO. It did so while also launching a &#x27;manifesto for old age&#x27; and establishing itself nationally as a lobbying body as well as an organisation that engaged in service provision and enhancement, training, and research.

The directors of Age Concern England have included David Hobman, Baroness Greengross, and Gordon Lishman – the current Director General.

In 1986 Age Concern established an Institute of Gerontology at King&#x27;s College London into which it folded its own Age Concern Research Unit.

== Heyday ==
On 30 May 2006, Age Concern launched Heyday – marking the launch by carrying out the UK&#x27;s biggest survey, asking 10 million people born in the 1940s and 1950s for views on issues such as ageism, pensions, and health.

Heyday was launched as a not-for-profit membership organisation for people planning for or in retirement. Heyday offered members access to expert advice on finances, work, retirement, and health, as well as putting them in touch with one another, for a small annual subscription.

With ambitious membership targets, Heyday proved an expensive and controversial exercise within the Age Concern Federation. Due to lower-than-expected membership take-up, Age Concern restructured the Heyday scheme to meet the low level of activity.

Shortly after a Charity Commission report made several recommendations, Heyday announced that the scheme would close on 31 March 2009, noting that Heyday would maintain a presence on the Age Concern website.

The charity commissioned Sir Christopher Kelly to investigate the project. His 2009 report concluded that Age Concern had lost over £22 million on the venture.

==Merger==
In May 2008, Age Concern England and Help the Aged announced plans for the two charities to merge.
Following consultation, this was confirmed in September, when Dianne Jeffrey was confirmed as the new chairman of trustees.

Tom Wright CBE, currently chief executive of VisitBritain, and Trustee of the Imperial War Museum
was appointed Chief Executive of the new charity in November 2008.

The merged charity, now known as Age UK was formed on 1 April 2009, and launched a major branding exercise in April 2010, featuring Brian Cox, Ian McKellen, and Eleanor Bron in the charity&#x27;s first television campaign. 

Many of the individual Age Concern charities, however, found the terms of the merger unacceptable and remain independent and have no connection with Age UK. Examples include Age Concern Luton, Age Concern Eastbourne and Age Concern Central Lancashire.

<doc id="179334" wikidata="Q49080" url="?curid=179334" title="Isaac Babel">
<text>Isaac Emmanuilovich Babel ( – 27 January 1940) was a Soviet writer, journalist, playwright, and literary translator. He is best known as the author of &quot;Red Cavalry&quot; and &quot;Odessa Stories&quot;, and has been acclaimed as &quot;the greatest prose writer of Russian Jewry&quot;. Babel was arrested by the NKVD on 15 May 1939 on fabricated charges of terrorism and espionage, and executed on 27 January 1940.

==Early years==

Isaac Babel was born in the Moldavanka section of Odessa in the Russian Empire, to Jewish parents, Manus and Feyga Babel. Soon after his birth, the Babel family moved to the port city of Nikolaev. They later returned to live in a more fashionable part of Odessa in 1906. Babel used Moldavanka as the setting for &quot;Odessa Stories&quot; and the play &quot;Sunset&quot;.

Although Babel&#x27;s short stories present his family as &quot;destitute and muddle-headed&quot;, they were relatively well-off. According to his autobiographical statements, Babel&#x27;s father, Manus, was an impoverished shopkeeper. Babel&#x27;s daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, stated that her father fabricated this and other biographical details in order to &quot;present an appropriate past for a young Soviet writer who was not a member of the Communist Party.&quot; In fact, Babel&#x27;s father was a dealer in farm implements and owned a large warehouse.

In his pre-teens, Babel hoped to get into the preparatory class of the Nicholas I Odessa Commercial School. However, he first had to overcome the Jewish quota. Despite the fact that Babel received passing grades, his place was given to another boy, whose parents had bribed school officials. As a result, he was schooled at home by private tutors.

In addition to regular school subjects, Babel studied the Talmud and music. According to Cynthia Ozick, &quot;Though he was at home in Yiddish and Hebrew, and was familiar with the traditional texts and their demanding commentaries, he added to these a lifelong fascination with Maupassant and Flaubert. His first stories were composed in fluent literary French. The breadth and scope of his social compass enabled him to see through the eyes of peasants, soldiers, priests, rabbis, children, artists, actors, women of all classes. He befriended whores, cabdrivers, jockeys; he knew what it was like to be penniless, to live on the edge and off the beaten track.&quot;

His attempt to enroll at Odessa University was blocked for ethnic reasons. Babel then entered the Kiev Institute of Finance and Business. There he met Yevgenia Borisovna Gronfein, daughter of a wealthy industrialist, whom he eventually married.

==Work==
===Early writings===
In 1915, Babel graduated and moved to Petrograd, in defiance of laws restricting Jews from living outside the Pale of Settlement. Babel was fluent in French, besides Russian, Ukrainian and Yiddish, and his earliest works were written in French. However, none of his stories in that language have survived.

In St. Petersburg, Babel met Maxim Gorky, who published some of Babel&#x27;s stories in his literary magazine &quot;Letopis&quot; (&quot;Летопись&quot;, &quot;Chronicle&quot;). Gorky advised the aspiring writer to gain more life experience; Babel wrote in his autobiography, &quot;I owe everything to that meeting and still pronounce the name of Alexey Maksimovich Gorky with love and admiration.&quot; One of his most famous semi-autobiographical short stories, &quot;The Story of My Dovecote&quot; (&quot;История моей голубятни&quot;, &quot;Istoriya moey golubyatni&quot;), was dedicated to Gorky.

There is very little information about Babel&#x27;s whereabouts during and after the October Revolution. According to one of his stories, &quot;The Road&quot; (&quot;&quot;Дорога&quot;, &quot;Doroga&quot;), he served on the Romanian front until early December 1917. In his autobiography, Babel says he worked as a translator for the Petrograd Cheka, likely in 1917. In March 1918 he worked in Petrograd as a reporter for Gorky&#x27;s Menshevik newspaper, &quot;Novaya zhizn&quot; (&quot;Новая жизнь&quot;, &quot;New Life&quot;&quot;). Babel continued publishing there until &quot;Novaya zhizn&quot; was forcibly closed on Lenin&#x27;s orders in July 1918.

Babel later recalled, &quot;My journalistic work gave me a lot, especially in the sense of material. I managed to amass an incredible number of facts, which proved to be an invaluable creative tool. I struck up friendships with morgue attendants, criminal investigators, and government clerks. Later, when I began writing fiction, I found myself always returning to these &#x27;subjects&#x27;, which were so close to me, in order to put character types, situations, and everyday life into perspective. Journalistic work is full of adventure.&quot;

===October&#x27;s Withered Leaves===
During the Russian Civil War, which led to the Party&#x27;s monopoly on the printed word, Babel worked for the publishing house of the Odessa Gubkom (regional CPSU Committee), in the food procurement unit (see his story &quot;Ivan-and-Maria&quot;), in the &quot;Narkompros&quot; (Commissariat of Education), and in a typographic printing office.

After the end of the Civil War, Babel worked as a reporter for &quot;The Dawn of the Orient&quot; (Заря Востока) a Russian-language newspaper published in Tbilisi. In one of his articles, he expressed regret that Lenin&#x27;s controversial New Economic Policy had not been more widely implemented.

Babel married Yevgenia Gronfein on August 9, 1919, in Odessa. In 1929, their marriage produced a daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, who grew up to become a scholar and editor of her father&#x27;s life and work. By 1925, the Babels&#x27; marriage was souring. Yevgenia Babel, feeling betrayed by her husband&#x27;s infidelities and motivated by her increasing hatred of communism, emigrated to France. Babel saw her several times during his visits to Paris. During this period, he also entered into a long-term romantic relationship with Tamara Kashirina. Together, they had a son, Emmanuil Babel, who was later adopted by his stepfather Vsevolod Ivanov. Emmanuil&#x27;s name was changed to Mikhail Ivanov, and he later became a noted artist.

After the final break with Tamara, Babel briefly attempted to reconcile with Yevgenia and they had their daughter Natalie in 1929. In 1932, Babel met a Siberian-born Gentile named Antonina Pirozhkova (1909–2010). In 1934, after Babel failed to convince his wife to return to Moscow, he and Antonina began living together. In 1939, their common law marriage produced a daughter, Lydia Babel.

According to Pirozhkova, &quot;Before I met Babel, I used to read a great deal, though without any particular direction. I read whatever I could get my hands on. Babel noticed this and told me, &#x27;Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won&#x27;t have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I&#x27;ll try to make you a list of them.&#x27; And a few days later he brought me a list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman—Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius—and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert.&quot;

===&quot;Red Cavalry&quot;===
In 1920, Babel was assigned to Komandarm (Army Commander) Semyon Budyonny&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Army, witnessing a military campaign of the Polish–Soviet War of 1920. He documented the horrors of the war he witnessed in the &quot;1920 Diary&quot; (&quot;Конармейский Дневник 1920 года&quot;, &quot;Konarmeyskiy Dnevnik 1920 Goda&quot;), which he later used to write &quot;Red Cavalry&quot; (&quot;Конармия&quot;, &quot;Konarmiya&quot;), a collection of short stories such as &quot;Crossing the River Zbrucz&quot; and &quot;My First Goose&quot;. The horrific violence of &quot;Red Cavalry&quot; seemed to harshly contrast the gentle nature of Babel himself.

Babel wrote: &quot;Only by 1923 I have learned how to express my thoughts in a clear and not very lengthy way. Then I returned to writing.&quot; Several stories that were later included in &quot;Red Cavalry&quot; were published in Vladimir Mayakovsky&#x27;s &quot;LEF&quot; (&quot;ЛЕФ&quot;) magazine in 1924. Babel&#x27;s honest description of the brutal realities of war, far from revolutionary propaganda, earned him some powerful enemies. According to recent research, Marshal Budyonny was infuriated by Babel&#x27;s unvarnished descriptions of marauding Red Cossacks and demanded Babel&#x27;s execution without success. However, Gorky&#x27;s influence not only protected Babel but also helped to guarantee publication. In 1929 &quot;Red Cavalry&quot; was translated into English by J. Harland and later was translated into a number of other languages.

Argentine author and essayist Jorge Luis Borges once wrote of &quot;Red Cavalry&quot;, The music of its style contrasts with the almost ineffable brutality of certain scenes. One of the stories—&quot;Salt&quot;—enjoys a glory seemingly reserved for poems and rarely attained by prose: many people know it by heart.

===&quot;Odessa Stories&quot;===

Back in Odessa, Babel started to write &quot;Odessa Stories&quot;, a series of short stories set in the Odessan ghetto of Moldavanka. Published individually between 1921 and 1924 and collected into a book in 1931, the stories describe the life of Jewish gangsters, both before and after the October Revolution. Many of them directly feature the fictional mob boss Benya Krik, loosely based on the historical figure Mishka Yaponchik. Benya Krik is one of the great anti-heroes of Russian literature. These stories were used as the basis for the 1927 film &quot;Benya Krik&quot;, and the stage play &quot;Sunset&quot;, which centers on Benya Krik&#x27;s self-appointed mission to right the wrongs of Moldavanka. First on his list is to rein in his alcoholic, womanizing father, Mendel.

According to Nathalie Babel Brown, &quot;&quot;Sunset&quot; premiered at the Baku Worker&#x27;s Theatre on October 23, 1927, and played in Odessa, Kiev, and the celebrated Moscow Art Theatre. The reviews, however, were mixed. Some critics praised the play&#x27;s &#x27;powerful anti-bourgeois stance and its interesting &#x27;fathers and sons&#x27; theme. But in Moscow, particularly, critics felt that the play&#x27;s attitude toward the bourgeoisie was contradictory and weak. &quot;Sunset&quot; closed, and was dropped from the repertoire of the Moscow Art Theatre.

However, &quot;Sunset&quot; continued to have admirers. In a 1928 letter to his White emigre father, Boris Pasternak wrote, &quot;Yesterday, I read &quot;Sunset&quot;, a play by Babel, and almost for the first time in my life I found that Jewry, as an ethnic fact, was a phenomenon of positive, unproblematic importance and power. ... I should like you to read this remarkable play...&quot;

According to Pirozhkova, filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein was also an admirer of &quot;Sunset&quot; and often compared it to the writings of Émile Zola for, &quot;illuminating capitalist relationships through the experience of a single family.&quot; Eisenstein was also quite critical of the Moscow Art Theatre, &quot;for its weak staging of the play, particularly for failing to convey to the audience every single word of its unusually terse text.&quot;

===&quot;Maria&quot;===
Babel&#x27;s play &quot;Maria&quot; candidly depicts both political corruption, prosecution of the innocent, and black marketeering within Soviet society. Noting the play&#x27;s implicit rejection of socialist realism, Maxim Gorky accused his friend of having a &quot;Baudelairean predilection for rotting meat.&quot; Gorky further warned his friend that &quot;political inferences&quot; would be made &quot;that will be personally harmful to you.&quot; According to Pirozhkova, &quot;Once Babel went to the Moscow Art Theater when his play &quot;Mariya&quot; was being given its first reading, and when he returned home he told me that all the actresses had been impatient to find out what the leading female role was like and who would be cast in it. It turned out that there was no leading female character present on the stage in this play. Babel thought that the play had not come off well, but ... he was always critical of his own work.&quot; Although intended to be performed in 1935, the &quot;Maria&quot;&#x27;s performance was cancelled by the NKVD during rehearsals. Despite its popularity in the West, &quot;Maria&quot; was not performed in Russia until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Carl Weber, a former disciple of Bertolt Brecht, directed &quot;Maria&quot; at Stanford University in 2004.
According to Weber, &quot;The play is very controversial. [It] shows the stories of both sides clashing with each other during the Russian Civil War—the Bolsheviks and the old society members—without making a judgment one way or another. Babel’s opinion on either side is very ambiguous, but he does make the statement that what happened after the Bolshevik Revolution may not have been the best thing for Russia.&quot;

==Life in the 1930s==
In 1930, Babel travelled in Ukraine and witnessed the brutality of forced collectivisation and dekulakisation. Although he never made a public statement about this, he privately confided in Antonina, &quot;The bounty of the past is gone—it is due to the famine in Ukraine and the destruction of the village across our land.&quot;

As Stalin tightened his grip on the Soviet intelligentsia and decreed that all writers and artists must conform to socialist realism, Babel increasingly withdrew from public life. During the campaign against &quot;Formalism&quot;, Babel was publicly denounced for low productivity. At the time, many other Soviet writers were terrified and frantically rewrote their past work to conform to Stalin&#x27;s wishes. However, Babel was unimpressed and confided in his protégé, the writer Ilya Ehrenburg, &quot;In six months time, they&#x27;ll leave the formalists in peace and start some other campaign.&quot;

At the first congress of the Union of Soviet Writers (1934), Babel noted ironically, that he was becoming &quot;the master of a new literary genre, the genre of silence.&quot; American Max Eastman describes Babel&#x27;s increasing reticence as an artist in a chapter called &quot;The Silence of Isaac Babyel&quot; in his 1934 book &quot;Artists in Uniform&quot;. However, according to Nathalie Babel Brown, his life was tolerable: &quot;The young writer burst upon the literary scene and instantly became the rage in Moscow. The tradition in Russia being to worship poets and writers, Babel soon became one of the happy few, a group that included Soviet writers who enjoyed exceptional status and privileges in an otherwise impoverished and despotic country. In the late 1930s, he was given a villa in the writer&#x27;s colony of Peredelkino, outside Moscow. No secret was ever made of his having a wife and daughter in Paris. At the same time, hardly anyone outside of Moscow knew of two other children he had fathered. As a matter of fact, Babel had many secrets, lived with many ambiguities and contradictions, and left many unanswered questions behind him.&quot;

In 1932, after numerous requests, he was permitted to visit his estranged wife Yevgenia in Paris. While visiting his wife and their daughter Nathalie, Babel agonized over whether or not to return to Soviet Russia. In conversations and letters to friends, he expressed a longing of being &quot;a free man,&quot; while also expressing fear at no longer being able to make a living solely through writing. On July 27, 1933, Babel wrote a letter to Yuri Annenkov, stating that he had been summoned to Moscow and was leaving immediately.

Babel&#x27;s common-law wife, Antonina Pirozhkova, recalled this era, &quot;Babel remained in France for so long that it was rumored in Moscow that he was never returning. When I wrote to him about this, he wrote back saying, &#x27;What can people, who do not know anything, possibly say to you, who knows everything?&#x27; Babel wrote from France almost daily. I accumulated many letters from him during his 11-month absence. When Babel was arrested in 1939, all of these letters were confiscated and never returned to me.&quot;

After his return to the Soviet Union, Babel decided to move in with Pirozhkova, beginning a common law marriage which would ultimately produce a daughter, Lidya Babel. He also collaborated with Sergei Eisenstein on the film &quot;Bezhin Meadow&quot;, about Pavlik Morozov, a child informant for the Soviet secret police. Babel also worked on the screenplays for several other Stalinist propaganda films.

According to Nathalie Babel Brown, &quot;Babel came to Paris in the summer of 1935, as part of the delegation of Soviet writers to the International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture and Peace. He probably knew this would have been his last chance to remain in Europe. As he had done numerous times during the last ten years, he asked my mother to return with him to Moscow. Although he knew the general situation was bad, he nevertheless described to her the comfortable life that the family could have there together. It was the last opportunity my mother had to give a negative answer, and she never forgot it. Perhaps it helped her later on to be proven completely right in her fears and her total lack of confidence in the Soviet Union. My mother described to me these last conversations with my father many times.&quot;

==Arrest and execution==
On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova was awakened by four NKVD agents pounding upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel&#x27;s dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: &quot;In the car, one of the men sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. &#x27;The worst part of this is that my mother won&#x27;t be getting my letters&#x27;, and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, &#x27;So I guess you don&#x27;t get too much sleep, do you?&#x27; And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, &#x27;I&#x27;ll be waiting for you, it will be as if you&#x27;ve gone to Odessa... only there won&#x27;t be any letters...&#x27; He answered, &#x27;I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.&#x27; &quot;But I don&#x27;t know what my destiny will be.&quot; At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, &quot;We have no claims whatsoever against you.&quot; We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, &quot;Someday we&#x27;ll see each other...&quot; And without looking back, he got out of the car and went through that door.&quot;

According to Nadezhda Mandelstam, Babel&#x27;s arrest became the subject of an urban legend within the NKVD. NKVD agents, she explains, were fond of &quot;telling stories about the risks they ran&quot; in arresting &quot;enemies of the people&quot;. Babel had, according to NKVD lore, &quot;seriously wounded one of our men&quot; while &quot;resisting arrest&quot;. Mrs. Mandelstam contemptuously declared, &quot;Whenever I hear such tales I think of the tiny hole in the skull of Isaac Babel, a cautious, clever man with a high forehead, who probably never once in his life held a pistol in his hands.&quot;

According to Peter Constantine, from the day of his arrest, Isaac Babel &quot;became a nonperson in the Soviet Union. His name was blotted out, removed from literary dictionaries and encyclopedias, and taken off school and university syllabi. He became unmentionable in any public venue. When the film director Mark Donskoi&#x27;s famous Gorky trilogy premiered the following year, Babel, who had worked on the screenplay, had been removed from the credits.&quot;

According to his file, &quot;Case #419, Babel, I.E.&quot;, the writer was held at the Lubyanka and Butyrka Prisons for a total of eight months as a case was built against him for Trotskyism, terrorism, and spying for Austria and France. At his initial interrogations, &quot;Babel began by adamantly denying any wrongdoing, but then after three days he suddenly &#x27;confessed&#x27; to what his interrogator was suggesting and named many people as co-conspirators. In all likelihood, he was tortured, almost certainly beaten.&quot; His interrogators included Boris Rodos, who had a reputation as a particularly brutal torturer, even by the standards of the time, and Lev Schwartzmann, who tortured the renowned theatre director Vsevolod Meyerhold. Among those he accused of conspiring with him were his close friends Sergei Eisenstein, Solomon Mikhoels, and Ilya Ehrenburg.

Despite months of pleading and letters sent directly to Beria, Babel was denied access to his unpublished manuscripts. In October 1939, Babel was again summoned for interrogation and denied all his previous testimony. A statement was recorded, &quot;I ask the inquiry to take into account that, though in prison, I committed a crime. I slandered several people.&quot; This led to further delays as the NKVD frantically attempted to salvage their cases against Mikhoels, Ehrenburg, and Eisenstein.
On 16 January 1940, Lavrentiy Beria presented Stalin with a list of 457 &#x27;enemies of the party and the soviet regime&#x27; who were in custody, with a recommendation that 346, including Isaac Babel, should be shot. According to Babel&#x27;s daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, his trial took place on January 26, 1940, in one of Lavrenti Beria&#x27;s private chambers. It lasted about twenty minutes. The sentence had been prepared in advance and without ambiguity: death by firing squad, to be carried out immediately. He was shot at 1:30 am on 27 January 1940.

Babel&#x27;s last recorded words in the proceedings were:

I am innocent. I have never been a spy. I never allowed any action against the Soviet Union. I accused myself falsely. I was forced to make false accusations against myself and others... I am asking for only one thing—let me finish my work.

He was shot the next day, and his body was thrown into a communal grave. All of this information was revealed in the early 1990s. According to Simon Sebag Montefiore, Babel&#x27;s ashes were buried with those of Nikolai Yezhov and several other victims of the Great Purge in a common grave at the Donskoy Cemetery. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a plaque was placed there which reads, &quot;Here lie buried the remains of the innocent, tortured, and executed victims of political repressions. May they never be forgotten.&quot;

According to the early official Soviet version, Isaac Babel died in the Gulag on March 17, 1941. Peter Constantine, who translated Babel&#x27;s complete writings into English, has described the writer&#x27;s execution as &quot;one of the great tragedies of 20th century literature.&quot;

==Rehabilitation==
On December 23, 1954, during the Khrushchev thaw, a typed half sheet of paper ended the official silence. It read, &quot;The sentence of the military collegium dated 26 January 1940 concerning Babel, I.E., is revoked on the basis of newly discovered circumstances and the case against him is terminated in the absence of elements of a crime.&quot; 

Babel&#x27;s works were once again widely published and praised. His public rehabilitation as a writer was initiated with the help of his friend and admirer Konstantin Paustovsky, and a volume of Babel&#x27;s selected works was published in 1957 with a laudatory preface by Ilya Ehrenburg. New collections of selected works by Babel were published in 1966, 1989 and 1990. Still, certain &quot;taboo&quot; parts such as mentions of Trotsky were censored until the glasnost period shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The first collections of the complete works of Babel were prepared and published in Russia in 2002 and 2006.

==Lost writings==

After his rehabilitation, Antonina Pirozhkova spent almost five decades campaigning for the return of Babel&#x27;s manuscripts. These included Babel&#x27;s translations of Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s writings from Yiddish into Russian, as well as several unpublished short stories and novellas. According to Pirozhkova, As Babel put it, he worked on Sholem Aleichem to &quot;feed his soul.&quot; Other &quot;food for the soul&quot; came from writing new stories and the novella &quot;Kolya Topuz.&quot; He told me, &quot;I&#x27;m writing a novella in which the main character is a former Odessa gangster like Benia Krik. His name is Kolya Topuz and so far, at least, that&#x27;s also the name of the novella. I want to show how this sort of man adapts to Soviet reality. Kolya Topuz works on a collective farm during collectivization, and then he goes to work in a Donbass coal mine. But since he has the mentality of a gangster, he&#x27;s constantly breaking out of the limits of normal life, which leads to numerous funny situations.&quot; Babel spent a great deal of time writing, and he finished many works. Only his arrest prevented his new works from coming out.&quot;

However, even requests by Ilya Ehrenburg and the Union of Soviet Writers produced no answers from the Soviet State. The truth was not revealed until the advent of Perestroika.

According to Pirozhkova, &quot;In 1987, when so much was changing in our country, I again made an official request that the KGB search for Babel&#x27;s manuscripts in its underground storage areas. In response to my request, I was visited by two KGB agents who informed me that the manuscripts had been burned. &#x27;And so you&#x27;ve come in person to avoid giving me a written response to my request, am I correct?&#x27; &#x27;How could you think such a thing? We came here to commiserate. We understand how precious Babel&#x27;s manuscripts would be.&#x27;&quot;

==Legacy==

According to John Updike, Maxim Gorky said to André Malraux that Babel was &quot;the best Russia has to offer.&quot; A quarter of a century later, Babel&#x27;s contemporary Konstantin Paustovsky wrote in his reminiscences, &quot;He was, for us, the first really Soviet writer.&quot;

Judith Stora-Sandor, one of Babel&#x27;s first biographers, wrote in 1968, that Babel&#x27;s &quot;literary sensibility was French, his vision Jewish, and his fate all too Russian.&quot;

After her husband&#x27;s return to Moscow in 1935, Yevgenia Gronfein Babel remained unaware of his other family with Antonina Pirozhkova. Based upon statements made by Ilya Ehrenburg, Yevgenia further believed that her husband was still alive and living in exile. In 1956, however, Ehrenburg told her of her husband&#x27;s execution while visiting Paris. After also informing Mrs. Babel of her husband&#x27;s daughter with Antonina Pirozhkova, Ehrenburg asked Yevgenia to sign a false statement attesting to a pre-war divorce from her husband. Enraged, Yevgenia Babel spat in Ehrenberg&#x27;s face and then fainted.

Her daughter, Nathalie Babel Brown, believes that Ehrenburg did this under orders from the KGB. With two potential contenders for the role of Babel&#x27;s widow, the Soviet State clearly preferred Babel&#x27;s common-law wife Antonina to his legal wife Yevgenia, who had emigrated to the West.

Although she was too young to have many memories of her father, Nathalie Babel Brown went on to become one of the world&#x27;s foremost scholars of his life and work. When W.W. Norton published Babel&#x27;s Complete Works in 2002, Nathalie edited the volume and provided a foreword. She died in Washington, D.C., in 2005.

Lydia Babel, the daughter of Isaac Babel and Antonina Pirozhkova, also emigrated to the United States and currently resides in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Although Babel&#x27;s play &quot;Maria&quot; was very popular at Western European colleges during the 1960s, it was not performed in Babel&#x27;s homeland until 1994. The first English translation appeared in 1966 in a translation by Michael Glenny in &quot;Three Soviet Plays&quot; (Penguin) under the title &quot;Marya&quot;. &quot;Maria&quot;&#x27;s American premiere, directed by Carl Weber, took place at Stanford University in 2004.

Several American writers have valued Babel&#x27;s writings. Hubert Selby has called Babel &quot;the closest thing I have to a literary influence.&quot; James Salter has named Babel his favorite short-story writer. &quot;He has the three essentials of greatness: style, structure, and authority.&quot; George Saunders, when asked for a literary influence said &quot;There&#x27;s a Russian writer named Isaac Babel that I love. I can drop in anywhere in his works, read a few pages, and go, Oh yeah, language. It&#x27;s almost like if you were tuning a guitar and you heard a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that&#x27;s what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear. It reminds me of the difference between an OK sentence and a really masterful sentence. Babel does it for me.&quot;

===Memorials===

A memorial to Isaac Babel was unveiled on the north-west corner of the intersection of Rishelievska Street and Zhukovskoho Street in Odesa in early September 2011, and, in conjunction with the inauguration of the memorial, a commemorative reading of three of his stories held, with musical interludes from the works of Isaac Schwartz, in the Philharmonic Hall in Pushkinska Street on September 6, 2011. The city also has an already existing Babelya Street in the Moldavanka.

== In popular culture ==
British writer Bernard Kops wrote a poem, and later a play, about Babel: &quot;Whatever Happened to Isaac Babel?&quot;

Brazilian writer Rubem Fonseca wrote a novel about the search for a lost manuscript from Babel: &quot;Vastas emoções e pensamentos imperfeitos&quot; (1988).

American author Travis Holland wrote his debut novel &quot;The Archivist&#x27;s Story” about an archivist, Pavel Dubrov, in Lubyanka Prison who has to authenticate a Babel manuscript. In the novel his meeting with Babel prompts him to save the story at great risk to himself.

Playwright Rajiv Joseph won an Obie Award for Best New American Play for his 2017 &quot;Describe the Night&quot;, which follows Babel from his role as a journalist in Poland through and beyond his execution, and the role his personal journal plays in uniting people across time and place.

<text>Decadence was a late-19th-century movement emphasizing the need for sensationalism, egocentricity, bizarre, artificial, perverse, and exotic sensations and experiences. By extension, it may refer to a decline in art, literature, science, technology, and work ethics, or (very loosely) to self-indulgent behavior.

Usage of the term sometimes implies moral censure, or an acceptance of the idea, met with throughout the world since ancient times, that such declines are objectively observable and that they inevitably precede the destruction of the society in question; for this reason, modern historians use it with caution. The word originated in Medieval Latin &quot;(dēcadentia)&quot;, appeared in 16th-century French, and entered English soon afterwards. It bore the neutral meaning of decay, decrease, or decline until the late 19th century, when the influence of new theories of social degeneration contributed to its modern meaning.

The idea that a society or institution is declining is called declinism. This may be caused by the predisposition, caused by cognitive biases such as rosy retrospection, to view the past more favourably and future more negatively. Declinism has been described as &quot;a trick of the mind&quot; and as &quot;an emotional strategy, something comforting to snuggle up to when the present day seems intolerably bleak.&quot; Other cognitive factors contributing to the popularity of declinism may include the reminiscence bump as well as both the positivity effect and negativity bias.

In literature, the Decadent movement began in France&#x27;s &quot;fin de siècle&quot; intermingling with Symbolism and the Aesthetic movement while spreading throughout Europe and the United States. The Decadent title was originally used as a criticism but it was soon triumphantly adopted by some of the writers themselves. The Decadents praised artifice over nature and sophistication over simplicity, defying contemporary discourses of decline by embracing subjects and styles that their critics considered morbid and over-refined. Some of these writers were influenced by the tradition of the Gothic novel and by the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe.

==History==
===Ancient Rome===

Decadence is a popular criticism of the culture of the later Roman Empire&#x27;s elites, seen also in much of its earlier historiography and 19th and early 20th century art depicting Roman life. This criticism describes the later Roman Empire as reveling in luxury, in its extreme characterized by corrupting &quot;extravagance, weakness, and sexual deviance&quot;, as well as &quot;orgies and sensual excesses&quot;.
==== Victorian-era Artwork on Roman Decadence ====
According to Professor Joseph Bristow of UCLA, decadence in Rome and the Victorian-era movement are connected through the idea of &quot;decadent historicism.&quot; In particular, decadent historicism refers to the &quot;interest among…1880s and 1890s writers in the enduring authority of perverse personas from the past&quot; including the later Roman era. As such, Bristow&#x27;s argument references how Heliogabalus, the title subject of Simeon Solomon&#x27;s painting &quot;Heliogabalus, High Priest of the Sun&quot; (1866), was &quot;a decadent icon&quot; for the Victorian movement. Bristow also notes that &quot;[t]he image [of the painting] summons many qualities linked with fin-de-siècle decadence [alongside his]…queerness[,]&quot; thus &quot;inspir[ing] late-Victorian writers [as]…they…imagine anew sexual modernity.&quot;

Heliogabalus is also the subject of &quot;The Roses of Heliogabalus&quot; (1888) by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, which, according to Professor Rosemary Barrow, represents &quot;the artist[&#x27;s]…most glorious revel in Roman Decadence.&quot; To Barrow, &quot;[t]he authenticity of the [scene]…perhaps had little importance for the artist[, meaning that] its appeal is the entertaining and extravagant vision it gives of later imperial Rome.&quot; Barrow also makes a point to mention &quot;that Alma-Tadema’s Roman-subject paintings [tend to]…make use of historical, literary and archaeological sources&quot; within themselves. Thus, the presence of roses within the painting as opposed to the original &quot;&#x27;violets and other flowers&#x27;&quot; of the source material emphasizes how &quot;the Roman world…h[eld] extra connotations of revelry and luxuriant excess&quot; about them.

===Decadent movement===
Decadence was the name given to a number of late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice over the earlier Romantics&#x27; naïve view of nature. Some of them triumphantly adopted the name, referring to themselves as Decadents. For the most part, they were influenced by the tradition of the Gothic novel and by the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe, and were associated with Symbolism and/or Aestheticism.

This concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from Montesquieu and Wilmot. It was taken up by critics as a term of abuse after Désiré Nisard used it against Victor Hugo and Romanticism in general. A later generation of Romantics, such as Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire took the word as a badge of pride, as a sign of their rejection of what they saw as banal &quot;progress.&quot; In the 1880s, a group of French writers referred to themselves as Decadents. The classic novel from this group is Joris-Karl Huysmans&#x27; &quot;Against Nature&quot;, often seen as the first great decadent work, though others attribute this honor to Baudelaire&#x27;s works.

In Britain and Ireland the leading figure associated with the Decadent movement was Irish writer, Oscar Wilde. Other significant figures include Arthur Symons, Aubrey Beardsley and Ernest Dowson.

The Symbolist movement has frequently been confused with the Decadent movement. Several young writers were derisively referred to in the press as &quot;decadent&quot; in the mid-1880s. Jean Moréas&#x27; manifesto was largely a response to this polemic. A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be seen as overlapping in some areas, the two remain distinct.

===1920s Berlin===

This &quot;fertile culture&quot; of Berlin extended onwards until Adolf Hitler rose to power in early 1933 and stamped out any and all resistance to the Nazi Party. Likewise, the German far-right decried Berlin as a haven of degeneracy. A new culture had developed in and around Berlin throughout the previous decade, including architecture and design (Bauhaus, 1919–33), a variety of literature (Döblin, &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, 1929), film (Lang, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, 1927, Dietrich, &quot;Der blaue Engel&quot;, 1930), painting (Grosz), and music (Brecht and Weill, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, 1928), criticism (Benjamin), philosophy/psychology (Jung), and fashion. This culture was considered decadent and disruptive by rightists.

Film was making huge technical and artistic strides during this period of time in Berlin, and gave rise to the influential movement called German Expressionism. &quot;Talkies&quot;, the sound films, were also becoming more popular with the general public across Europe, and Berlin was producing very many of them.

Berlin in the 1920s also proved to be a haven for English-language writers such as W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender and Christopher Isherwood, who wrote a series of &#x27;Berlin novels&#x27;, inspiring the play &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;, which was later adapted into a musical, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, and an Academy Award winning film of the same name. Spender&#x27;s semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Temple&quot; evokes the attitude and atmosphere of the place at the time.

=== Decadent Nihilistic Art ===
The philosophy of decadence comes from the work of German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), however, Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), a specific philosopher of decadence, conceptualized modern decadence on a more influential scale. Holding decadence to be in any condition, ultimately limiting what something or someone can be, Nietzsche used his exploration in nihilism to critique traditional values and morals that threatened the decline in art, literature, and science. Nihilism, generally, is the rejection of moral principles, ultimately believing that life is meaningless. Nihilism, for Nietzsche, was the ultimate fate of Western civilization as old values lost their influence and purpose, in turn, disappeared among society. Predicting a rise in decadence and aesthetic nihilism, creators would renounce the pursuit of beauty and instead welcome the incomprehensible chaos. In art, there have been movements connected to nihilism, such as cubism and surrealism, that pushes for abandoned viewpoints to ultimately tap into the potential of one&#x27;s conscious mind. Because of this, paintings like 1875-76&#x27;s &quot;L’Absinthe&quot; by Edgar Degas and 1915&#x27;s &quot;Black Square&quot; by Kazimir Malevich were created. &quot;L’Absinthe,&quot; which first showed in 1876, was mocked and called disgusting when panned by critics. Some say the painting is a blow to morality, as a glass filled with Absinthe, an alcoholic drink, rests in front of a woman at a table. Taken to be in bad faith and quite uncouth, Degas&#x27;s art took decadence as a way to portray ambiguity in random subjects that seem to be drifting between depression and euphoria. Using nihilism in a synonymously way, Degas denoted his paintings to a general mood of despair, mainly at existence as a whole. Comparing this piece to Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s &quot;Black Square,&quot; abstract nihilistic art in the Western tradition was only beginning to take shape as the 20th century came about. Malevich&#x27;s perception of this piece embraced a philosophy connected to Suprematism – a new realism in painting that evokes non-objectivity to experience &quot;white emptiness of a liberated nothing,&quot; as said by Malevich himself. In nihilism, life has, in a sense, no truth, therefore no action is objectively preferable to another. Malevich&#x27;s decadent painting shows the complete abandonment of depicting reality, and instead creates his own world of new form. When the painting was first exhibited, the public was in chaos, as society was in its first World War and Malevich reflected a new social revolution as a symbol of a new tomorrow, disregarding the past to move forward. Because of this painting and Degas&#x27;s, decadence can be portrayed as a physiological foundation for nihilism, bringing out a term called &quot;Decadent Nihilism:&quot; existing beyond the world, and that of vain virtues. According to Nietzsche, Western metaphysical and nihilistic thought is decadent because of its confirmation from &#x27;others&#x27; (apart from oneself) based on ideas of a nihilistic God. The extreme position an artist takes is what makes their pieces decadent.

== Decadent Aesthetics ==

=== Controversy ===
Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1955)

Aesthetics falling under the category of decadence often include controversy. An example of a controversial style founded through decadent literary influence is the novel, &quot;Lolita&quot;, by Vladimir Nabokov, a Russian-American citizen. &quot;Lolita&quot;, while expressing the prose through a pedophile&#x27;s narration, directly expresses Nabokov&#x27;s discourse with decadent literature. According to Will Norman from the University of Kent, the novel makes many references to prominent historical figures related to decadence, such as Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Baudelaire. Norman states, &quot;... Lolita &quot;emerges as the risky reinstatement of a transatlantic decadent tradition, in which the failure of temporal and ethical containment disrupts a dominant narrative of modernism&#x27;s history in American letters&quot;&quot;. &quot;Lolita&quot; purposefully exemplifies a moral decline, while simultaneously disregarding the ethics of Nabokov’s time. The emphasis on its temporal standing in history captures an intermediate state of decadent literature itself. Norman describes that &quot;... Nabokov reproduces the tension between American regionalism and modernist cosmopolitanism in his own &#x27;Edgar H. Humbert&#x27;, as the European aesthete embarks on his road-trip with Dolores...&quot;. The text exemplifies Nabokov&#x27;s desire to replicate the many social disparities of American culture while using his character, H. Humbert, to demonstrate a lack of moral judgement. Norman continues, &quot;Nabokov&#x27;s text positions &quot;itself&quot; as the dynamic historical agent, importing Poe wholesale (from caricature through to complex literary intellectual) into the present and facilitating his critique in the hands of the reader&quot;. Leaving the judgement in the hands of the reader, Nabokov uses &quot;Lolita&quot; to work through the complexities that decadence presents for ethical or moral obligations to society. Norman concludes, &quot;&quot;Lolita&quot; joins American works such as William Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; (1929) and F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; (1934) which assimilate themes of incest and sexual pathology into their decadent aesthetics, with the effect of bringing European temporalities into conflict with American social modernity&quot;. Using a controversial method, Nabokov employs decadent aesthetics to document a moment of historical transition.

Women in Decadence

Not only do the stylistic choices of literature in decadence cause ethical debate, but the presence of women in literature also causes controversy in politics. Viola Parente-Čapková, a Lecturer from the university in Prague, Czech Republic, argues that women writers following decadent literary structure have been overlooked due to their simultaneous influence of the feminist movement. The belief that women could not separate morality from their writing due to their purposeful prose to argue for women&#x27;s rights suggests a theme of misogyny, in which men excluded women from being considered Decadent writers because of the possibility of a desire for social change.

Social Change

Decadence offers a world-view, in that &quot;it is an ideological phenomenon originating in the experience of a particular group, and it became the aesthetics of the upper-middle class&quot;. Changes in European industrialization and urbanization led to the development of the proletariat, nuclear family, and entrepreneurial class . The values of Decadence formed as an opposition to &quot;those of an earlier and supposedly more vital bourgeoisie&quot;. Aesthetically, progress turns into decay, activity becomes play instead of goal-oriented work, and art becomes a way of life. To individuals that observe the changes in social structure after rapid industrialization, the idea of progress becomes something to rebel against, because this real-world progress seems to be leaving them behind.

== Modern-day perspectives ==

===Postmodernist Connection to Decadence===

Nearly a century after the supposed end of the decadent period itself, the spirit and drive of it continued in the next end of the century. Unknowingly following in the footsteps of the decadents before them, postmodernists have subscribed to many of the same habits. Both groups have found themselves simultaneously exhausted by all the new experiences of society while still putting all their efforts into experiencing it all. The postmodernist is simultaneously aware of their desire for modernist disintegration all while enjoying the products of their dying predecessor. This ravenous eye for the new is reflective of the lives of the practicing decadent, where they too enjoyed all the new experiences offered by their own time&#x27;s modernity. Both events were deeply intertwined with expanding globalization. As seen in the lives of decadents in their literary and visual art pursuit and creation, so too has the postmodernist been given more global connection and experience.  During the rise of postmodernism, there has been a clear concentration of power and wealth that supported globalization. This resurgence of power to apply has restructured the desires of the disintegration-loving postmodernist, indulging themselves in all the newness of globalized life. This renewed interest in a global view of the world brought along a renewed interest in different forms of artistic representation as well. 
Modernism tends to belittle popular culture through its oppressive nature, which can be seen as elitist and controlling, as it privileges certain works of art above others. As a result, postmodern artists and writers developed a contempt for the canon, rejecting tradition and essentialism. This disdain for privilege extended to the fields of philosophy, science, and of course, politics. Pierre Bourdieu provides some insight into the attitudes of this new sub-class and its relation to post-modern theorists, embodied through students of bourgeois descent. They began to pursue their artistic interests at their schools after being shadowed academically. They are victims of verdicts which, like those of the school, appeal to reason and science to block off the paths leading (back) to power, and are quick to denounce science, power, the power of science, and above all perhaps a power which, like the triumphant technology of the moment, appeals to science to legitimate itself. This postmodern way of thought is guided by an anti-institutional temperament that flees competitions and hierarchies. These systems allow art to become confined by labels – postmodern work is difficult to define. In the name of the fight against &#x27;taboos&#x27; and the liquidation of &#x27;complexes&#x27; they adopt the most external and most easily borrowed aspects of the intellectual life-style, liberated manners, cosmetic or sartorial outrages, emancipated poses and postures, and systematically apply the cultivated disposition to not-yet-legitimate culture (cinema, strip cartoons, the underground), to every-day life (street art), the personal sphere (sexuality, cosmetics, child-rearing, leisure) and the existential (the relation to nature, love, death). Their craft evolves into a way of being that directly criticizes modernist attitudes, and enables postmodern artists and writers with a newfound sense of freedom through rebellion.

=== Jacques Barzun ===

The historian Jacques Barzun (1907–2012) gives a definition of decadence which is independent from moral judgement. In his bestseller &quot;From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life&quot; (published 2000) he describes decadent eras as times when &quot;the forms of art as of life seem exhausted, the stages of development have been run through. Institutions function painfully.&quot; He emphasizes that &quot;decadent&quot; in his view is &quot;not a slur&quot; but &quot;a technical label&quot;.

With reference to Barzun, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Ross Douthat characterizes decadence as a state of &quot;economic stagnation, institutional decay and cultural and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development&quot;. Douthat sees the West in the 21st century in an &quot;age of decadence&quot;, marked by stalemate and stagnation. He is the author of the book &quot;The Decadent Society&quot;, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2020.

=== Pria Viswalingam ===

Pria Viswalingam, an Australian documentary and film maker, sees the western world in decay since the late 1960s. Viswalingam is the author of the six-episode documentary TV series &quot;Decadence: The Meaninglessness of Modern Life&quot;, broadcast in 2006 and 2007, and the 2011 documentary film &quot;Decadence: The Decline of the Western World&quot;.

According to Viswalingam, western culture started in 1215 with the Magna Carta, continued to the Renaissance, the Reformation, the founding of the United States, the Enlightenment and culminated with the social revolutions of the 1960s.

Since 1969, the year of the moon landing, the My Lai massacre, the Woodstock Festival and the Altamont Free Concert, „decadence depicts the west&#x27;s decline&quot;. As symptoms he names increasing suicide rates, addiction to anti-depressants, exaggerated individualism, broken families and a loss of religious faith as well as „treadmill consumption, growing income-disparity, b-grade leadership&quot; and money as the only benchmark for value.

==Use in Marxism==
===Leninism===
According to Vladimir Lenin, capitalism had reached its highest stage and could no longer provide for the general development of society. He expected reduced vigor in economic activity and a growth in unhealthy economic phenomena, reflecting capitalism&#x27;s gradually decreasing capacity to provide for social needs and preparing the ground for socialist revolution in the West. Politically, World War I proved the decadent nature of the advanced capitalist countries to Lenin, that capitalism had reached the stage where it would destroy its own prior achievements more than it would advance.

One who directly opposed the idea of decadence as expressed by Lenin was José Ortega y Gasset in &quot;The Revolt of the Masses&quot; (1930). He argued that the &quot;mass man&quot; had the notion of material progress and scientific advance deeply inculcated to the extent that it was an expectation. He also argued that contemporary progress was opposite the true decadence of the Roman Empire.

===Left communism===
Decadence is an important aspect of contemporary left communist theory. Similar to Lenin&#x27;s use of it, left communists, coming from the Communist International themselves started in fact with a theory of decadence in the first place, yet the communist left sees the theory of decadence at the heart of Marx&#x27;s method as well, expressed in famous works such as &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot;, &quot;Grundrisse&quot;, &quot;Das Kapital&quot; but most significantly in &quot;Preface to the Critique of Political Economy&quot;.

Contemporary left communist theory defends that Lenin was mistaken on his definition of imperialism (although how grave his mistake was and how much of his work on imperialism is valid varies from groups to groups) and Rosa Luxemburg to be basically correct on this question, thus accepting capitalism as a world epoch similarly to Lenin, but a world epoch from which no capitalist state can oppose or avoid being a part of. On the other hand, the theoretical framework of capitalism&#x27;s decadence varies between different groups while left communist organizations like the International Communist Current hold a basically Luxemburgist analysis that makes an emphasis on the world market and its expansion, others hold views more in line with those of Vladimir Lenin, Nikolai Bukharin and most importantly Henryk Grossman and Paul Mattick with an emphasis on monopolies and the falling rate of profit.

<doc id="179340" wikidata="Q6617302" url="?curid=179340" title="List of deaths from drug overdose and intoxication">
<text>Drug overdose and intoxication are significant causes of accidental death and can also be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.

Drug use and overdoses increased significantly in the 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also increased significantly following the invention of the hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.

Efforts to prohibit various drugs began to be enacted in the early 20th century, though the effectiveness of such policies is debated. Deaths from drug overdoses are increasing. Between 2000 and 2014, fatal overdoses rose 137% in the United States, causing nearly half a million deaths in that period, and have also been continually increasing in Australia, Scotland, England, and Wales. 
While prohibited drugs are generally viewed as being the most dangerous, the misuse of prescription drugs is linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. , benzodiazepines were most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia, with diazepam (Valium) being the drug most responsible. While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.

This alphabetical list contains 634 people whose deaths can be reliably sourced to be the result of drug overdose or acute drug intoxication. Where sources indicate drug overdose or intoxication was only suspected to be the cause of death, this will be specified in the &#x27;notes&#x27; column. Where sources are able to indicate, deaths are specified as &#x27;suicide&#x27;, &#x27;accidental&#x27;, &#x27;undetermined&#x27;, or otherwise in the &#x27;cause&#x27; column. Where sources do not explicitly state intent, they will be listed in this column as &#x27;unknown&#x27;. Deaths from accidents or misadventure caused by drug overdoses or intoxication are also included on this list. Deaths from long-term effects of drugs, such as tobacco-related cancers and cirrhosis from alcohol, are not included, nor are deaths from lethal injection or legal euthanasia.

<doc id="179342" wikidata="Q952688" url="?curid=179342" title="G. Gordon Liddy">
<text>George Gordon Battle Liddy (November 30, 1930 – March 30, 2021) was an American lawyer and FBI agent who was convicted of conspiracy, burglary, and illegal wiretapping for his role in the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration.

Working alongside E. Howard Hunt, Liddy organized and directed the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building in May and June 1972. After five of Liddy&#x27;s operatives were arrested inside the DNC offices on June 17, 1972, subsequent investigations of the Watergate scandal led to Nixon&#x27;s resignation in 1974. Liddy was convicted of burglary, conspiracy, and refusing to testify to the Senate committee investigating Watergate. He served nearly 52 months in federal prisons.

He later joined with Timothy Leary for a series of debates on multiple college campuses, and similarly worked with Al Franken in the late 1990s. Liddy served as a radio talk show host from 1992 until his retirement on July 27, 2012. His radio show was syndicated in 160 markets by Radio America and on both Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio stations in the United States. He was a guest panelist for Fox News Channel in addition to appearing in a cameo role or as a guest celebrity talent on several television shows.

== Early years ==
=== Youth, family, education ===
Liddy was born in Brooklyn on November 30, 1930. His father, Sylvester James Liddy, was a lawyer; his mother was Maria (Abbaticchio) Liddy. His family was of Irish and Italian descent, and Liddy had a strict Catholic upbringing. He was named for George Gordon Battle, a noted attorney and Tammany Hall leader. He was raised in Hoboken and West Caldwell, New Jersey. He attended St. Benedict&#x27;s Preparatory School, his father&#x27;s alma mater, in Newark.

=== College, military, law school ===
Liddy was educated at Fordham University, graduating in 1952. While at Fordham he was a member of the National Society of Pershing Rifles. Following graduation, Liddy joined the United States Army, serving for two years as an artillery officer during the Korean War era. Although he attained the rank of first lieutenant, he was not deployed overseas, having been assigned to an antiaircraft radar unit in Brooklyn for medical reasons. In 1954, he was admitted to the Fordham University School of Law, earning a position on the &quot;Fordham Law Review&quot;. After graduating in 1957, he worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) under J. Edgar Hoover.

== FBI ==
Liddy began his career with the FBI in 1957, initially serving as a field agent in Indiana and Denver. While stationed in Denver, he made a significant arrest on September 10, 1960: Ernest Tait, a notable criminal who had twice appeared on the Ten Most Wanted. 

At age 29, Liddy became the youngest bureau supervisor at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.. Under the mentorship of deputy director Cartha DeLoach, Liddy secured a position on director J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s personal staff, even acting as Hoover&#x27;s ghostwriter. Despite his achievements, Liddy was also known for his reckless behavior among his fellow agents, highlighted by two particular incidents. 

The first incident took place in Kansas City, Missouri, during a covert operation. He was arrested but was subsequently released after contacting Clarence M. Kelley, former FBI agent and the then-chief of the Kansas City Police. The second incident involved an FBI background check that Liddy conducted on his future wife before they got married in 1957. Liddy later claimed this action was a routine precautionary measure.

Prior to his departure from the FBI in 1962, Liddy sought admission to various bars, leveraging his professional contacts. His application for admission to the United States Supreme Court was supported by Solicitor General Archibald Cox.

== Prosecutor and politician ==

Liddy resigned from the FBI in 1962 and worked under his father as a patent attorney in New York City until 1966. He was then hired by District Attorney Raymond Baratta as a prosecutor in exurban Dutchess County, New York, after providing references from the FBI. In 1966, he led a drug raid on the Hitchcock Estate (then occupied by Timothy Leary) in Millbrook, New York, leading to an unsuccessful trial. Although the case generated much publicity, other lawyers complained that Liddy received credit for something in which he played a relatively small role. He was also reprimanded for firing a revolver at the ceiling in a courtroom. In 1969, a drug raid directed by Liddy at Bard College scooped up, among others, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, who later formed the band Steely Dan and wrote the song &quot;My Old School&quot; about the raid. Liddy is referred to in the lyrics as &quot;Daddy Gee&quot;.

During that period, Liddy ran unsuccessfully for the post of District Attorney. In 1968, he continued to seek office by running in the Republican Party&#x27;s primary election for New York&#x27;s 28th congressional district. Employing the slogan &quot;Gordon Liddy doesn&#x27;t bail them out; he puts them in&quot;, he lost to Hamilton Fish IV in a close race. Liddy then accepted the nomination of the Conservative Party of New York State and ran in the general election against Fish and the Democratic candidate, Millbrook businessman John S. Dyson. Fearing that Liddy might tip the election to Dyson, Fish turned to the district&#x27;s Republican leader, State Assemblyman Kenneth L. Wilson, to get Liddy out of the race. Wilson&#x27;s office dispatched the matter to the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington, resulting in Liddy being offered a potential Richard Nixon administration political appointment at the United States Department of the Treasury; this prompted him to officially suspend his campaign. While Liddy&#x27;s name remained on the ballot (garnering almost five percent of the vote), it was not enough to forestall Fish&#x27;s election.

After serving as county director of Nixon&#x27;s successful presidential campaign, he began the aforementioned political role as a special assistant for narcotics and gun control at the Treasury Department&#x27;s Washington, D.C. headquarters in early 1969. Shortly thereafter, he helped to establish the country&#x27;s contemporary sky marshal program under the aegis of the United States Marshals Service.

Beginning in 1970, he served with Gordon Strachan and David Young as an aide to Domestic Affairs Advisor John D. Ehrlichman in the Executive Office of the President at the behest of Egil &quot;Bud&quot; Krogh, who had worked on initiatives with Liddy at the Treasury Department. He served as the nominal general counsel to the finance committee of the Committee to Re-elect the President (CRP) from 1971 to 1972. Subsequently, Krogh, Liddy, Young, and Erlichman were indicted for conspiracy to commit burglary in September 1973.

== White House undercover operative ==

After serving in several mid-level law enforcement and domestic policy roles in the Nixon administration, Liddy was moved to Nixon&#x27;s 1972 re-election campaign in 1971 order to extend the scope and reach of the White House Plumbers &quot;special investigations unit&quot;, which had been created in response to damaging leaks of information to the press. Liddy&#x27;s own name for the group was ODESSA, a reference to escape plans made by the Nazis.

At CRP, Liddy concocted several plots in early 1972, collectively known under the title &quot;Operation Gemstone&quot;. Some of these were far-fetched, intended to embarrass the Democratic opposition. These included kidnapping anti-war protest organizers and transporting them to Mexico during the Republican National Convention (which at the time was planned for San Diego), as well as luring mid-level Democratic campaign officials to a house boat in Miami, where they would be secretly photographed in compromising positions with prostitutes. Most of Liddy&#x27;s ideas were rejected by Attorney General John N. Mitchell (who became campaign manager in March 1972), but a few were given the go-ahead by Nixon administration officials, including the 1971 break-in at Daniel Ellsberg&#x27;s psychiatrist&#x27;s office in Los Angeles. Ellsberg had leaked the Pentagon Papers to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. At some point, Liddy was instructed to break into the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate Complex.

===Watergate burglaries===
Liddy was the Nixon administration liaison and leader of the group of five men who broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Complex. At least two separate entries were made in May and June 1972; the burglars were apprehended on June 17. The purposes of the break-in were never conclusively established. The burglars sought to place wiretaps and planned to photograph documents. Their first attempt had led to improperly-functioning recording devices being installed. Liddy and Hunt masterminded the break-in from the Watergate Hotel Room 214, where they could look right into the DNC office, but Liddy claimed he did not actually enter the Watergate Complex at the time of the burglaries; rather, he admitted to supervising the second break-in which he coordinated with E. Howard Hunt, from room 723 in the adjacent Howard Johnson Hotel. Liddy was convicted of conspiracy, burglary, and illegal wiretapping.

Liddy was sentenced to a 20-year prison term and was ordered to pay $40,000 in fines. He began serving the sentence on January 30, 1973. He claimed that on arrival he sang the Horst Wessel Song, the Nazi Party anthem. On April 12, 1977, President Jimmy Carter commuted Liddy&#x27;s sentence to eight years, &quot;in the interest of equity and fairness based on a comparison of Mr. Liddy&#x27;s sentence with those of all others convicted in Watergate related prosecutions&quot;, leaving the fine in effect. Carter&#x27;s commutation made Liddy eligible for parole as of July 9, 1977. Liddy was released on September 7, 1977, after serving a total of four and a half years of incarceration.

Liddy was charged with two counts of contempt of Congress in March 1974, on the same day that he and the three Cuban burglars were charged with the Watergate-related crimes. Following a bench trial on May 10, 1974, Liddy was convicted of contempt for his refusal to answer questions of the Special Subcommittee of Intelligence of the House Armed Services Committee, which was investigating the CIA&#x27;s links to the break-in of the offices of Dr. Lewis Fielding, the psychiatrist to Daniel Ellsberg. Liddy was found guilty and was handed a suspended jail sentence and probation; the judge stated that the sentence was lenient because Liddy was already sentenced to prison on the Watergate charges. Liddy became one of very few people in American history to be convicted of criminal contempt of Congress.

==After prison==
In 1980, Liddy published an autobiography, titled &quot;Will&quot;, which sold more than a million copies and was made into a . In it, he states that he was willing to kill during the Ellsberg break-in, and that he once made plans with Hunt to kill journalist Jack Anderson, based on a literal interpretation of a Nixon White House statement, &quot;we need to get rid of this Anderson guy&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Liddy joined forces with former Niles, Illinois, policeman and co-owner of the Protection Group, Ltd., Thomas E. Ferraro Jr., to launch a private security and countersurveillance firm called G. Gordon Liddy &amp; Associates.
Liddy emerged to host his own talk radio show in 1992. Less than a year later, its popularity led to national syndication through Viacom&#x27;s Westwood One Network, and through Radio America in 2003. His radio show was syndicated in 160 markets, and was on both Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio stations in the United States. Liddy&#x27;s show ended on July 27, 2012. He was also an occasional guest panelist for the Fox News Channel.

In 1994 and 1995, Liddy repeatedly told listeners of his radio program to shoot federal law enforcement officers, giving instructions to aim for their heads. In many of these statements he referenced shooting in self-defense. After the Oklahoma City bombing, when President Clinton denounced the &quot;many loud and angry voices&quot; in conservative talk radio, Liddy responded that the head is a difficult target to hit and that he used pictures of the President and Hillary Clinton for target practice.

Liddy was sued for defamation in 1999 by Ida &quot;Maxie&quot; Wells, a secretary whose desk at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at the Watergate was said to have been a target of the last Watergate break-in in order to find evidence related to an alleged prostitution ring kept in Wells&#x27; desk. Wells&#x27; suit accused Liddy of defamation. Liddy denied the allegation, and the judge dismissed the suit, commenting that &quot;no &#x27;reasonable jury&#x27; could have found in favor of the plaintiff.&quot;

In addition to &quot;Will&quot;, he wrote the nonfiction books, &quot;When I Was a Kid, This Was a Free Country&quot; (2002), and &quot;Fight Back! Tackling Terrorism, Liddy Style&quot; (2006, with his son, Cdr. James G. Liddy, along with J. Michael Barrett and Joel Selanikio). He also published two novels: &quot;Out of Control&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Monkey Handlers&quot; (1990). Liddy was one of many people interviewed for the biography of Abbie Hoffman, &quot;Steal this Dream&quot;, by Larry &quot;Ratso&quot; Sloman.

==Lectures, acting career and documentaries ==

In the mid-1980s Liddy went on the lecture circuit, being listed as the top speaker on the college circuit in 1982 by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He later joined onetime foil Timothy Leary in a series of debates billed as &quot;Nice Scary Guy vs. Scary Nice Guy&quot; on the college circuit as well; Leary had once been labeled by Liddy&#x27;s ex-employer Richard Nixon as &quot;the most dangerous man in America&quot;. The lectures were the subject of a 1983 documentary film, &quot;Return Engagement&quot;. 

In 1994, the British documentary company Brian Lapping Associates sent producers Norma Percy and Paul Mitchell to interview many of the conspirators for its series titled &quot;Watergate&quot;, in which an unrepentant Liddy talked frankly about his role. He was filmed at home while sitting in front of his sizable collection of firearms and describing &quot;how he had been ready, if ordered, to go straight out and kill Jack Anderson, the Washington D.C. columnist.&quot; At one point he was filmed wielding one of his pistols before the TV camera. It was made clear that, at the time of filming, the gun collection was registered in his wife&#x27;s name, as he was ineligible for a license.

Liddy acted in several films, including &quot;Street Asylum&quot;, &quot;Feds&quot;, &quot;Adventures in Spying&quot;, &quot;Camp Cucamonga&quot;, and &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;. He appeared on such television shows as &quot;The Highwayman&quot;, &quot;Airwolf&quot;, &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, and &quot;MacGyver&quot;. He had recurring roles in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and &quot;Super Force&quot;, and guest starred in Al Franken&#x27;s &quot;LateLine&quot;. On April 7, 1986, he appeared at &quot;WrestleMania II&quot; as a guest judge for a boxing match between Mr. T (with Joe Frazier and The Haiti Kid) versus Roddy Piper (with Bob Orton and Lou Duva). In April 1987 he appeared as a celebrity partner for a week on the game show &quot;Super Password&quot;, playing against Betty White.

Liddy appeared in the 1993 Golden Book Video release of &quot;Encyclopedia Brown: The Case of the Burgled Baseball Cards&quot; as Corky Lodato. In &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, he acted with John Diehl, who would later go on to portray Liddy himself in Oliver Stone&#x27;s movie &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995). During his two guest appearances in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, Liddy played William &quot;Captain Real Estate&quot; Maynard, a shadowy former covert operations officer whom Sonny Crockett knew from his military service in South Vietnam. 

Liddy co-starred on &quot;18 Wheels of Justice&quot; as the crime boss Jacob Calder from January 12, 2000, to June 6, 2001. He appeared on a celebrity edition &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, the show&#x27;s series finale, on September 12, 2006 (filmed in November 2005). At 75, Liddy was the oldest contestant ever to appear on the show. He beat the competition in the first two stunts, winning two motorcycles custom built by Metropolitan Chopper.

Liddy was also an interviewee in the 2006 documentary &quot;The U.S. vs. John Lennon&quot;, as well as a commercial spokesman for Rosland Capital, selling gold on television commercials.

==Personal life==
Liddy was married to Frances Purcell-Liddy, a native of Poughkeepsie, New York, for 53 years until her death on February 5, 2010. She was a teacher. The couple had five children: Thomas, Alexandra, Grace, James, and Raymond. Raymond became a deputy attorney general but was convicted of possession of child pornography and disbarred.

In his later life, Liddy was an opponent of animal experimentation.

==Death==
Liddy died on March 30, 2021, at age 90, at his daughter&#x27;s house in Fairfax County, Virginia, while suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Barry Sanders (born July 16, 1968) is an American former professional football running back who played for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL) for 10 seasons. Sanders led the league in rushing yards four times and in rushing touchdowns once, establishing himself as one of the most elusive runners in the history of the NFL with his quickness and agility, despite being only 5 ft 8 tall and weighing 203 lbs. Sanders played college football for the Oklahoma State Cowboys. As a junior in 1988, he compiled what is widely considered the greatest individual season by a running back in college football history, rushing for 2,628 yards and 37 touchdowns in 11 games. He won the Heisman Trophy and was unanimously recognized as an All-American.

Sanders was selected by the Lions in the 1989 NFL draft, and had an immediate impact in his rookie season, winning the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award. In 1991, Sanders helped lead the Lions to their first postseason win since 1958. In 1994, Sanders was awarded the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award (OPOY). In 1997, he rushed for 2,053 yards in the regular season and was co-awarded the NFL Most Valuable Player Award (shared with Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre), alongside his second NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. While still performing at a high level, Sanders unexpectedly retired from professional football in 1999, at the age of 31, and 1,457 yards short of breaking the NFL&#x27;s then all-time rushing record held by Walter Payton. Sanders cited the Lions&#x27; front office and declining team production as reasons for his retirement. He finished his career with 15,269 rushing yards (fourth all-time), and 99 rushing touchdowns (tenth all-time); in each of his ten seasons he was selected to a Pro Bowl and All-Pro team. The Lions retired Sanders&#x27; No. 20 jersey on November 25, 2004, and he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame three months prior. A year later, Sanders was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame with former college teammate Thurman Thomas.

In 2007, he was ranked by NFL Networks&#x27; &quot;NFL Top 10&quot; series as the most elusive runner in NFL history, and was placed No. 1 on the list of the greatest players never to play in a Super Bowl. He is considered by many as one of the greatest running backs in NFL history. Bleacher Report ranked Sanders No. 1 on their list of greatest running backs in NFL history. He averaged 1,527 rushing yards per season and just under 100 rushing yards per game (99.8). Sanders was first inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame in 1998, into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2003 and in that same year inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. In 2000, Sanders was included in the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team, and in 2019, Sanders was named to the National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

==Early life==
Sanders was born on July 16, 1968, in Wichita, Kansas, the seventh of eleven children to William and Shirley Sanders. His father worked as a roofer and carpenter, while his mother worked as a homemaker for the Sanders family. Sanders and two of his brothers worked as roofers&#x27; assistants to his father. As a child, Sanders was known for having an appetite, being able to eat an entire loaf of bread in one sitting. He would often listen to regional college sports games that his father would play on TV. Mitch Albom of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; wrote: &quot;All day they would labor, with the hammers, with the tar, sweating in the hot summer sun. You did not complain in the Sanders family. Not unless you wanted a good whupping.&quot;

Sanders played football at Wichita North High School. Before this, he enjoyed playing youth football and basketball. Although Barry dreamed of playing running back, he only played defensive back for most of his high school career. Sanders was labeled as an undersized back and wasn’t a starter at tailback as a junior due to future Chicago Bears draft pick and older brother Byron Sanders running the rock. When Byron graduated and left for Northwestern University on a football scholarship, Sanders was expected to start at tailback in his senior year—but instead was started at wingback—a variant of the wide receiver position. His head coach at the time perceived that his small stature would be a liability and that he &quot;lacked contact courage.&quot; Besides taking part in football, he played basketball as a guard. Table-tennis and baseball were also sports that Sanders took part in. During this period—according to writer Samuel Crompton—the Sanders family had to &quot;scrimp and save to get by&quot;.

Sanders did not become the starting running back until the fourth game of his senior year, when the original player was suspended for disciplinary reasons; he rushed for 274 yards and four touchdowns in that game. He rushed for 1,417 yards on 139 rushing attempts, averaging 10.2 yards per rushing attempt, and scored 17 touchdowns through his seven-game senior season. In the last game of the season, Wichita North&#x27;s head coach, Dale Burkholder, offered Sanders more playing time in order to gain enough rushing yards to reach the state rushing title, but Sanders declined, saying it was &quot;not important.&quot; For his season, Sanders earned all-state honors, and was named an Honorable Mention All-American. Although he was viewed as a stellar athlete, because of his short stature Sanders received scholarship offers from only Wichita State University, Iowa State University, University of Tulsa, and Oklahoma State University; he accepted the offer from Oklahoma State.

Sanders later said that his choice to play at Oklahoma State caused a conflict between him and his father. When Oklahoma State&#x27;s coach came to his father&#x27;s house with a letter of intent the day Sanders signed with the team, his father was frustrated, saying as the coach walked out the door that Sanders was &quot;making a big mistake&quot; when signing with the team. His father was similarly frustrated because Oklahoma State played in the same conference as the Oklahoma Sooners, whom William was a fan of. A friend of Sanders told him that William said Sanders had chosen to play at Oklahoma State &quot;in order to hide&quot;; Sanders would be playing behind Heisman candidate Thurman Thomas, as opposed to playing at a school where he would be the starting running back. Eventually, his father supported Sanders at Oklahoma State, and attended all of his games when he played.

===College career===
Sanders enrolled at Oklahoma State University, where he played for the Oklahoma State Cowboys from 1986 to 1988 and wore the No. 21 jersey. During his first two years, he backed up Thomas at running back. In 1986, Sanders played in eight games and rushed for 325 rushing yards on 74 rushing attempts, with two rushing touchdowns. In 1987, he led the nation in yards per kickoff return (31.6), while rushing for 603 yards and scoring nine rushing touchdowns, catching four passes for 58 receiving yards and a touchdown, and scoring two touchdowns from 29 total special teams returns. He was named a second-team College Football All-American as a return specialist. While still a backup to Thomas, he received notable attention from his opponents. Oklahoma Sooners head coach Barry Switzer in particular told his players not to injure Thomas, in fear of Sanders starting in his place, telling them: &quot;You won&#x27;t touch this kid&quot;. Sanders was not fond of this as he believed Thomas to be a good teammate. Thomas moved on to the NFL in 1988, which allowed Sanders to become the starter for his junior year in college.

In 1988, in what is considered one of the greatest individual seasons in college football history, Sanders became the first player to open two consecutive seasons with a 100-yard kickoff return. He led the nation by averaging 7.6 yards per attempt and over 200 yards per game, including rushing for over 300 yards in four games. Despite his massive workload of 344 attempts, Sanders was still used as the team&#x27;s punt and kickoff returner, adding another 516 yards on special teams. He set college football season records with 2,628 yards rushing, 3,250 total all-purpose yards, broken by Christian McCaffrey in 2015, 234 points, broken by Montee Ball in 2011, 37 rushing touchdowns, and 39 total touchdowns, (37 rushing, one kick return, one punt return, tied with Ball).

Sanders had five consecutive 200-yard games, scored at least two touchdowns in all eleven games, and eight times he scored at least three touchdowns. Sanders ran for 222 yards and scored five touchdowns in just three quarters of action in the 1988 Holiday Bowl, a game that is not included in the official NCAA season statistics. When added to his original rushing total, Sanders recorded 2,850 rushing yards from a workload of 373 attempts, 3,472 all-purpose yards, 264 points, 42 rushing touchdowns, and 44 total touchdowns. Sanders learned of his Heisman Trophy win while he was with the team in Tokyo, Japan preparing to face Texas Tech in the Coca-Cola Classic, accepting the award via satellite; he garnered 559 first-place votes for 1,878 points, becoming the eighth non-college senior to attain the trophy, and was selected as a unanimous All-American. Nevertheless, he believed Rodney Peete should have won the award. Along with his Heisman Trophy, Sanders was awarded the Maxwell Award, the Walter Camp Award, and named the Big Eight Offensive Player of the Year. Sanders initially announced that he was not going to enter the NFL draft, but after receiving pressure from his father, he announced his entrance into the draft.

==Professional career==
=== Detroit Lions (1989–1998) ===

Sanders, a college junior, was originally ineligible for the NFL Draft. However, Oklahoma State had been under investigation by the NCAA for recruiting violations. On the first day of 1989, the NCAA placed the Cowboys on four years&#x27; probation. If Sanders had stayed for his senior season, his games would not have been televised live, and he would not be able to play in a bowl game. Due to these circumstances, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle allowed Sanders to enter the draft. One year after he was selected, the NFL allowed all juniors to participate. During pre-draft measurements, Sanders was measured at 5 ft 8 in tall, and weighed at 203 lbs.

The Detroit Lions drafted Sanders third overall in the 1989 NFL draft, after Troy Aikman and Tony Mandarich, thanks to the endorsement of head coach Wayne Fontes. The Lions competed in the Central Division of the National Football Conference (NFC). Since the completion of the NFL-AFL merger in 1970, the Lions had made the postseason only twice, and had not had a season at or above .500 since their most recent playoff season in 1983. Fontes, who took over the coaching position midway through the previous season, was impressed with Sanders&#x27; athletic ability after he lifted 225 lbs (102 kg) for 21 reps. Lions&#x27; management considered drafting another &quot;Sanders&quot;, cornerback Deion Sanders, but Fontes convinced them to draft Barry instead. Fontes offered Sanders jersey No. 20, which had been worn by former Lions running back Billy Sims; Sims was one of the league&#x27;s premier running backs in the early 1980s, and Fontes requested he wear the number in tribute to Sims. Sanders had doubts about what his career would have been like if another team selected him, such as the Green Bay Packers, who selected Mandarich at No. 2, later saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I would&#x27;ve done if I was drafted by Green Bay, I don&#x27;t know if I would&#x27;ve wanted to play in Green Bay, I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve handled this weather every day.&quot;

Sanders did not participate in the training camp of his rookie season due to a contract dispute. He eventually came to monetary terms with the Lions, signing a deal for five years, $9.5 million, including a $2.1 million signing bonus—ten percent of which ($210,000), he donated to his local church: Paradise Baptist Church. In his first Lions press conference, Sanders prefaced that he wanted to assist in restoring the franchise&#x27;s reputation in the NFL landscape, stating that he wanted to help &quot;restore the roar in the dome.&quot;

==== Early years and postseason win (1989–1991) ====
As a rookie in 1989, Sanders started 13 out of a possible 16 games for the Lions. In his first career professional game against the Phoenix Cardinals on September 10, Sanders ran for 71 yards on nine attempts and scored a rushing touchdown in the 16–13 loss. Against the Chicago Bears, Sanders compiled 126 yards on 18 attempts and a touchdown in the 47–27 loss, but became injured with bruised ribs and a hip pointer that plagued him through the rest of the season. On October 1, Sanders only had one yard on five attempts against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 23–3 loss. Against the Minnesota Vikings, Sanders had 23 attempts for 99 yards in the 24–17 loss. After the game, Vikings head coach Jerry Burns asked game officials to check if Sanders had applied silicone to himself; Burns believed this was why his players had difficulty tackling him. No illegal substance was ever found. On December 24, the final game of the season, he had 158 yards on 20 attempts to go along with three touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons. During the game, the Lions installed a special phone line in one of the press boxes to monitor Christian Okoye, a running back for the Kansas City Chiefs who, at the time, was tied with Sanders for the league rushing title. When Okoye&#x27;s game ended, Sanders trailed Okoye by only ten yards. Fontes offered Sanders the chance to return to the Lions&#x27; game to gain enough yards to pass Okoye, after Sanders was pulled from the game when the score was in the Lions&#x27; favor. Yet Sanders declined to return to the game, letting Okoye keep the rushing title. Sanders finished the season totaling 1,470 rushing yards off of 280 attempts and 14 touchdowns. His rushing total was both a rookie franchise record, and a franchise record for any running back in Lions history (both records held previously by Billy Sims). Sanders was awarded the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award, and named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team. He was also selected to the Pro Bowl and was named a first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press (AP). The Lions struggled that season, posting a record and failing to make the postseason, despite winning five straight games to end the year.

On September 9, 1990, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sanders had 79 yards from 14 rushing attempts and a goal-line touchdown in the 38–21 loss in the Lions&#x27; regular season opener. Against the Green Bay Packers on September 30, Sanders had 20 attempts for 94 yards in the 24–21 loss in Week 4. Sanders had 16 attempts for 90 yards and a touchdown, coupled with five receptions for 135 yards receiving and a 47-yard receiving touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs in the 43–24 loss in Week 6. On November 4, playing against the Washington Redskins, Sanders had 11 rushes for 104 yards and a touchdown, in a game where the Lions surrendered a 21-point lead to lose 38–41. On December 10 against the Los Angeles Raiders, Sanders was credited with a season-high 176 yards from 25 attempts and two touchdowns in the 38–31 loss. He earned his first NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for his game against the Raiders. On December 22 against the Packers, Sanders had 19 attempts for 133 yards and a touchdown in the 24–17 victory. Sanders had a productive year, finishing the year first in the NFL in rushing yards, with 1,304, becoming the first Lions running back to lead the league in rushing yards since Byron White in 1940. He ranked third in rushing touchdowns (13), and sixth in both attempts (255), and yards per attempt (5.1). As a result, Sanders was selected to his second Pro Bowl and was again named an AP first-team All-Pro. The Lions finished the year with a record and missed the postseason for the seventh consecutive season.

On September 1, 1991, Sanders was inactive for the Lions&#x27; 45–0 shutout loss against the Washington Redskins, due to having sore ribs before the opening kickoff. The loss was the franchise&#x27;s worst in over 20 years. On November 24, 1991, against the Minnesota Vikings, Sanders dominated, with 220 rushing yards on 23 attempts and four touchdowns, a game the Lions won 34–14. Sanders dedicated the win to teammate Mike Utley, who suffered a career-ending spinal cord injury the previous game. In the final game of the regular season against the Buffalo Bills, Sanders had 26 attempts for 108 yards and a touchdown, but fumbled in Lions territory, allowing the Bills to tie the game; the Lions would still be victorious, ending 17–14 in overtime. Sanders finished the regular season with 1,548 rushing yards from a workload of 342 attempts. He led the league in rushing touchdowns, with a career-high 16. Subsequently, he was selected to the Pro Bowl and AP first-team All-Pro team and awarded the Bert Bell Award. The 1991 season was the most successful season in terms of wins with Sanders starting at running back. With a record, the Lions clinched the NFC Central and made the postseason for the first time since 1983, with Fontes being awarded that year&#x27;s National Football League Coach of the Year Award. Until 2024, the 12 wins were the most in a season by the Lions franchise in its history. Having the seed in the NFC, the Lions skipped the Wild Card Round and advanced to the Divisional Round, where they faced the Dallas Cowboys. Sanders helped lead the Lions to their first postseason victory since the team won the 1957 NFL Championship Game. In the game, Sanders was held to only 22 yards rushing before he broke away for a 47-yard touchdown run, in which he broke several tackles to close out the 38–6 victory. In the NFC Championship Game, Sanders was held to eleven attempts for 44 yards in the Lions&#x27; blowout 41–10 loss to the eventual Super Bowl-winning Redskins. Sanders finished the postseason with 23 attempts for 113 yards and a touchdown. He would never win another playoff game in his career after that season.

==== Mid-career (1992–1994) ====
On September 13, 1992, Sanders had 26 attempts for 66 yards against the Minnesota Vikings. Against the Washington Redskins the following week, Sanders recorded 14 attempts for only 34 yards in the 13–10 loss. On November 22, Sanders compiled 29 attempts for 151 yards and a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals. His rushing total against the Bengals brought his career total to 5,202 rushing yards, passing Sims for a new franchise record. Sanders finished his final regular season game with 19 attempts for 104 yards against the San Francisco 49ers. Overall, Sanders was credited with 1,352 rushing yards from a workload of 312 attempts and nine touchdowns; his rushing yards total ranked fourth in the league, and his attempts ranked third. He was selected to the Pro Bowl and named an AP second-team All-Pro for the first time. The Lions regressed from their previous season, posting a record for the year, and missed the playoffs after making the conference championship the prior year.

During the 1993 season, Sanders appeared to be well on his way to that year&#x27;s NFL rushing title; however, on November 25, 1993, against the Chicago Bears, after rushing for 63 yards on 16 attempts, Sanders was forced to leave the game with an injury. The Lions revealed after the game that Sanders had suffered a torn medial collateral ligament (MCL), and would miss three to five weeks. It was subsequently revealed by a physician that Sanders had also torn his posterior cruciate ligament. As a result, Sanders was inactive for the last five games of the regular season. In his final contract year, Sanders and the Lions agreed to a four-year, $17.2-million contract, making him the highest-paid running back in the NFL, and the third-highest-paid player overall, behind John Elway and Steve Young. Starting in only 11 games due to the injury, he finished in the top ten in multiple rushing categories. Sanders was fifth in the league in rushing yards (1,115 rushing yards), ninth in attempts (243), and second in rushing yards per game (101.4 rushing yards per game); with a career-low three rushing touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl and an AP second-team All-Pro. The Lions finished the regular season with a record, clinching the NFC Central and a postseason berth. The Lions faced their division rival Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card Round. Sanders, after being cleared for the game, recorded 27 attempts for 169 yards, the best statistical postseason game of his career; but the Lions lost 28–24.

On September 11, 1994, Sanders struggled, as he had 12 attempts for only 16 yards in a 10–3 loss against the Minnesota Vikings. Against the Dallas Cowboys the following week, Sanders improved with a career-high 40 attempts for 194 yards. For his performance, he was named the NFC Offensive Player of The Week. On September 25, 1994, against the New England Patriots, Sanders recorded 18 attempts for 131 yards and two touchdowns. During the game, Sanders had one of the most memorable runs of his career. While rushing 39 yards for a touchdown, Sanders juked and spun his way to the end zone, causing Patriots safety Harlon Barnett to spin around trying to tackle Sanders. Barnett later spoke of the moment: &quot;I&#x27;m not embarrassed about what happened. I thought I did pretty good. I got in front of him twice&quot;, Barnett then added, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t stay there.&quot; Against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in a 14–9 win, Sanders had arguably the best statistical game of his career, compiling a career-high 237 rushing yards (franchise record), off of 26 attempts; setting the record for most rushing yards in a single game without scoring a touchdown. Sanders entered the final game of the season within striking distance of 2,000 yards rushing, but finished the loss to the Miami Dolphins with only 12 carries for 52 yards. Nonetheless, Sanders finished first in the league in rushing yards, recording 331 attempts for 1,883 yards rushing and scoring seven touchdowns. His single-season rushing total was fourth in NFL history up to that point. He totaled 2,166 yards from scrimmage, which, at the time, was the seventh-most ever in a season. As a result of his season, he was selected to the Pro Bowl and named an AP first-team All-Pro after the regular season. Sanders was named the NFL Offensive Player of the Year (OPOTY) for the 1994 season and finished second in NFL Most Valuable Player voting behind Steve Young. The Lions finished the year with a record and made the postseason with a wild card spot. The Lions faced the Green Bay Packers again in the Wild Card Round, after being defeated by them the previous season. On December 31, Sanders struggled against the Packers and recorded what is viewed as the worst game of his career, having 13 attempts for -1 rushing yards. Six of his 13 attempts went for negative yardage, and the Lions as a team were held to only -4 rushing yards in the game, losing 16–12.

==== Playoff disappointments and MVP season (1995–1998) ====
The 1995 season began against the Pittsburgh Steelers; Sanders recorded 21 rushing attempts for 108 yards. On September 25 against the San Francisco 49ers, Sanders had a down game, recording 17 attempts for only 24 yards. Against the Cleveland Browns, Sanders improved with 157 yards from 18 attempts and three touchdowns, including a 75-yard touchdown run, in a 38–20 victory. Sanders finished with 314 attempts for 1,500 yards and 11 touchdowns. For his season, Sanders was selected to the Pro Bowl and named an AP first-team All-Pro. The Lions posted a record and made the postseason with a wild card spot, where they faced the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card Round. Sanders had ten attempts for 40 yards as the Lions&#x27; rushing game was stuffed by the Eagles&#x27; defense. The Lions were likewise overwhelmed by the Eagles&#x27; offense and faced a 44-point deficit in the third quarter 51–7, eventually losing the game 58–37; despite teammate Lomas Brown stating before the game that a Lions victory was &quot;guaranteed&quot;. At the time, this was the highest-scoring postseason game in NFL history, with 95 points scored. This record was bested by one point in a 51–45 victory by the Arizona Cardinals over the Green Bay Packers in 2009.

In 1996, during the first game of the season against the Minnesota Vikings, Sanders recorded 24 rushing attempts for 163 rushing yards. Against the Oakland Raiders, Sanders had nine attempts for only 36 yards. On November 3 against the Green Bay Packers, Sanders had 20 attempts for 152 yards and a touchdown. Against the Seattle Seahawks on November 17, Sanders had 16 attempts for 134 yards and a touchdown. Against the Chicago Bears the following week, Sanders had 21 attempts for 107 yards and a touchdown. Sanders had 20 attempts for 134 yards and a touchdown against the Vikings, but a missed two-point conversion attempt after his touchdown resulted in the Lions losing 22–24. In the final game of the season, he recorded 28 attempts for 175 yards against the San Francisco 49ers. Overall, Sanders finished the regular season first in the league in rushing yards with 1,553 rushing yards from 307 attempts. He scored 11 rushing touchdowns, and had 97.1 rushing yards per game, which was first in the league. At this point in his career, Sanders had 11,725 career rushing yards, seventh all-time, and ranked eighth all-time in career rushing touchdowns, with 84. The Lions regressed, posting a record, and failed to make the postseason after three straight playoff seasons from 1993 to 1995; though Sanders still made the Pro Bowl and was named an AP second-team All-Pro.

Before the start of the 1997 season, Fontes was fired after nine seasons coaching the Lions, and replaced by Bobby Ross; Sanders was saddened by Fontes&#x27; firing, believing he deserved another chance at coaching the team. On September 7 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Sanders struggled on the ground, having 10 attempts for only 20 yards, but recorded 102 receiving yards and a touchdown. On October 12, Sanders dominated with 215 yards from 24 attempts and two touchdowns against the Buccaneers, passing Jim Brown to be the fourth-ranked career rushing leader in NFL history, with 12,513 career rushing yards; he also caught a seven-yard touchdown pass. Against the Indianapolis Colts, Sanders had another stellar performance, compiling 24 attempts for 216 yards and two touchdowns (including one of 80 yards). With the win, Sanders became the first running back with ten consecutive games with 100 yards rushing in a season, and became the first running back to have three touchdowns of 80+ yards in a season. Against the Chicago Bears, Sanders had 19 attempts for 167 yards and three touchdowns, passing Eric Dickerson to become the second-ranked rusher for career yards behind Walter Payton On December 21, 1997, Sanders entered the season finale against the New York Jets needing at least 131 rushing yards to reach 2,000 for the season; both teams needed a win to clinch a playoff berth. Sanders reached the 2,000 mark on a two-yard run; finishing the game with 23 attempts for 184 yards and a touchdown; helping the Lions edge the Jets 13–10. Sanders had a season that is considered among the greatest ever by a running back. He recorded 2,053 rushing yards, which was first in the league that season, from 335 attempts and 11 touchdowns, becoming just the third running back in history to reach 2,000 rushing yards in a season. For his accomplishments, he credited his offensive linemen, stating: &quot;Without them, I wouldn&#x27;t have run far at all.&quot; Sanders rushed for 100+ yards in the season&#x27;s final 14 games, an NFL record. With 2,358 total scrimmage yards, he broke the single-season record for scrimmage yards that was held by Marcus Allen; the record was broken two seasons later by Marshall Faulk, and again by Chris Johnson in 2009. Sanders was named to the Pro Bowl and AP first-team All-Pro, and awarded the Bert Bell Award. Sanders was also awarded his second NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award, and the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) (co-won with Brett Favre). The Lions posted a record and clinched a wild card spot as the No. 5 seed in the NFC. Sanders and the Lions faced the Buccaneers, who were playing their first home postseason game since 1979. Sanders had 18 attempts for 65 yards as the Lions lost 10–20 in the Wild Card Round, after quarterback Scott Mitchell left the game with an injury in the third quarter.

On September 13, 1998, against the Cincinnati Bengals, Sanders recorded 185 rushing yards from 26 rushing attempts with three touchdowns in the 34–28 loss in Week 2. Sanders had 22 attempts for 69 yards in a 6–29 loss against the Minnesota Vikings. On November 26, 1998, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Sanders had a down game, with 20 attempts for only 33 rushing yards; the Lions were still victorious 19–16 in overtime. Against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Sanders had 18 attempts for 102 yards. In Sanders&#x27; final game of his career, on December 27, 1998, he had 19 attempts for 41 yards in a 10–19 loss against the Baltimore Ravens. Sanders capped off his final season with 1,491 rushing yards (fourth in the league), from a career-high 343 attempts (fifth in the league), and four touchdowns. He was nine yards short of completing five straight seasons with at least 1,500 rushing yards. He was selected to his tenth Pro Bowl, and named an AP second-team All-Pro. The Lions struggled despite Sanders&#x27; performances, going , and failing to make the playoffs.

== Retirement ==

On July 27, 1999, Sanders announced his retirement from pro football, the day before Lions training camp was set to start. His retirement was made public by faxing a letter to &quot;The Wichita Eagle,&quot; his hometown newspaper. In the letter, Sanders wrote: &quot;Shortly after the end of last season, I felt that I probably would not return for the 1999–2000 season. I also felt that I should take as much time as possible to sort through my feelings and make sure that my feelings were back with conviction. Today, I officially declare my departure from the NFL.&quot;He left football healthy, having gained 15,269 rushing yards (the most ever by any NFL player in a 10-year span). He retired within 1,457 rushing yards of Walter Payton&#x27;s career rushing mark of 16,726 yards. It has been speculated that Sanders would have surpassed the record if he had not retired early, a view held by Emmitt Smith, the eventual holder of the record. His father praised him for his decision, saying that it &quot;took guts.&quot; Sanders took time in his decision, waiting &quot;till the last minute.&quot; His retirement voided $20.9 million in collective salary and bonuses, along with millions of dollars in endorsements.

Sanders&#x27; retirement came somewhat unexpectedly and was a matter of controversy. Two years earlier, Sanders had renewed his contract with the Lions for $34.56 million over six years with an $11 million signing bonus. The Lions demanded that he return $7.37 million of the bonus. Sanders&#x27; agents refused, and the Lions filed a grievance with the NFL. On February 15, 2000, an arbitrator ruled that Sanders had to immediately repay $1,833,000 (one sixth of the bonus), with three sixths of the bonus to be repaid over each of the three years Sanders had left on the contract provided he stayed retired. Before the ruling, Sanders offered to pay back the entire bonus in return for him being traded to another team or his release.

It was thought by some that Lions head coach Bobby Ross himself may have actually been the reason for Sanders&#x27; early retirement, but in his autobiography &quot;Barry Sanders: Now You See Him&quot;, Sanders praised Ross as a head coach who had nothing directly to do with his retirement. It was more his frustration with the management and direction of the Lions and the resulting lack of success that contributed to his retirement, as Sanders revealed in his autobiography: &quot;My retirement letter didn&#x27;t even hint at my frustration, because I didn&#x27;t want to take shots at people as I left ... Management had let quality players slip away. We&#x27;d been losing for years. Now we were right back where we were when I arrived.&quot; He wrote: &quot;A goal that I still hadn&#x27;t realized was playing in the Super Bowl, and all of the statistical achievements didn&#x27;t put the team any closer to playing in the big game.&quot; Sanders has since patched things up with the Lions, rejoining the organization in a paid role as a team ambassador in 2017, and they dedicated a bronze statue to him outside Ford Field in September 2023.

On November 21, 2023, &quot;Bye Bye Barry&quot;, a documentary film about his decision to retire while approaching the all-time rushing record, was released on Amazon Prime.

== Legacy ==
Sanders is widely regarded as one of the greatest running backs in the history of the NFL, being ranked No. 1 by Bleacher Report and in the top ten by other media outlets. When he retired, Sanders was ranked second all-time in career rushing yards with 15,269 rushing yards, sixth all-time in career rushing touchdowns with 99 rushing touchdowns, and second all-time in career rushing attempts with 3,062 attempts. As of 2022, Sanders is still ranked in the top ten in all three statistics. Over his entire career, Sanders averaged 1,527 rushing yards per season, and 99.8 rushing yards per game, the latter stat second to Jim Brown. He never went below 1,000 yards in any of his ten seasons and has the second-most career 1,000-yard rushing seasons, with ten. Sanders was a notable bright spot on a Lions franchise that had endured years of unsuccessful play, helping to lead the team to their first playoff victory in decades. At the same time, Sanders only won one playoff game throughout his ten-year career, with NFL Network&#x27;s Derrin Horton stating: &quot;Not even Barry Sanders... could pull Detroit out of the playoff snakebit,&quot; in reference to the team&#x27;s postseason failures. The Lions&#x27; overall unsuccessful play was noted for possibly being a reason for Sanders&#x27; early retirement. His number 20 was retired by the Lions on November 25, 2004, along with Sims and Lem Barney (who wore the same number). Sanders was also honored by the Lions when they inducted him into the Pride of the Lions, the franchise&#x27;s ring of honor. In 2023, the Lions also immortalized Sanders with an 8-foot bronze statue located outside of Ford Field.

Throughout his career, he achieved Pro Bowl and All-Pro status in all ten of his NFL seasons. Sanders was named first-team All-Pro six times; and named second-team All-Pro four times. Sanders was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year in 1994 and 1997, awarded two Bert Bell Awards, and was named to the 1990s NFL All-Decade team. Both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame enshrined him on August 8, 2004, and August 21, 2005, respectively. At the age of 36, Sanders became the second-youngest player to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2019, Sanders was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 2007, he was ranked by NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;NFL Top 10&quot; series as the most elusive runner in NFL history, and in 2012 was placed No. 1 on their list of the greatest players to never play in a Super Bowl.

Sanders led the NFL in rushing yards four times (second to Brown), and in rushing touchdowns once in 1994. He co-won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award in 1997 (with Brett Favre) after rushing for 2,053 yards in 16 games, becoming the third running back to surpass 2,000 yards. In the same season, Sanders totaled a record 2,358 yards from scrimmage, later surpassed by both Marshall Faulk and Chris Johnson. By the end of his career, Sanders was known as &quot;one of the game&#x27;s most electrifying runners&quot;, as described by the Pro Football Hall of Fame; this was a view shared by &quot;Sports Illustrated,&quot; who described him as &quot;running circles around NFL defenses with an electrifying style unlike anything the league has seen.&quot; His 1989 season is regarded as one of the best all-time by a rookie running back, ranked No. 3 by NFL analyst Elliot Harrison, and No 4. by ESPN analyst Jeff Merron. In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes, and other sports figures ranked Sanders as the 76th greatest North American athlete of the 20th-century.

Although he sat behind fellow Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Thurman Thomas on the depth chart for his first two collegiate seasons, Sanders is considered one of the greatest college football players of all time. His Heisman trophy-winning season in 1988, in which he set single-season college football records for most rushing yards gained, touchdowns scored, and total scrimmage yards (among other records), is often considered the greatest individual college football season ever, ranked No. 1 by ESPN and Sporting News. In commemoration of the 150th year of college football, Sanders was honored during halftime at the College Football Playoff National Championship game on January 13, 2020, as the No. 9 player of all time.

In contrast to many of the star players of his era, Sanders was noted for his on-field humility. Despite his flashy playing style, Sanders was rarely seen celebrating after the whistle was blown; instead, he handed the ball to a referee, and was never tempted into celebrating any further. He was recognized for putting his team&#x27;s success over his stats, as shown when he denied a request from head coach Wayne Fontes to return to play in a game so that he could gain enough rushing yards to become the rushing leader for that season. He disliked speaking to the press, and rarely spoke about his accomplishments publicly. When reflecting on his career, ESPN described Sanders as a &quot;humble superstar.&quot;

==Personal life==

Sanders is a Christian. He and his wife, Lauren Campbell Sanders, a former news anchor for WDIV in Detroit, filed for divorce in February 2012 after 12 years of marriage. Sanders&#x27; brother, Byron, was the starting running back at Northwestern University, and would be selected by the Chicago Bears in the 9th round of the 1989 NFL draft. Byron was cut by the Bears two months after joining the franchise.

Sanders has four sons: Barry J. Sanders, Nick, Nigel, and Noah; the youngest three are from his marriage to Campbell. When the couple divorced, Sanders requested joint custody of them, while Campbell kept their medical coverage. Sanders&#x27; oldest son, Barry J. Sanders, played running back at Stanford University from 2012 to 2015, and Oklahoma State University in 2016. In 2022–2023, his son Nick played basketball at Michigan State University. In 2003, Sanders co-wrote his autobiography, &quot;Barry Sanders: Now You See Him: His Story In His Own Words,&quot; with Mark McCormick. He has reportedly donated to several charities, under the condition that they do not disclose his participation in any of them.

Sanders introduced ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the Chicago Bears and the Lions on October 10, 2011. In April 2013, Sanders made it to the finals of the vote to be on the cover of EA Sports &quot;Madden NFL 25&quot;, which celebrated the game&#x27;s 25th anniversary, by beating head coach Ron Rivera in Round One, running back Marcus Allen in Round Two, linebacker Ray Lewis in Round Three, quarterback Joe Montana in the quarter-finals, and wide receiver Jerry Rice in the semi-finals. In the final round, he defeated running back Adrian Peterson to become the next cover athlete, the first player to appear on the cover of &quot;Madden NFL Football&quot; more than once (he appeared in the background of the &quot;Madden NFL 2000&quot; cover).

In December 2024, Sanders opened a new car wash in Madison Heights, Michigan. Sanders has been to many Lions games including the playoffs.

<text>One Hundred and One Dalmatians (also known as 101 Dalmatians) is a 1961 American animated adventure comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions with distribution by Buena Vista Distribution. Adapted from Dodie Smith&#x27;s 1956 novel &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, the film was directed by Hamilton Luske, Clyde Geronimi, and Wolfgang Reitherman in his feature-length directorial debut, from a script by Bill Peet. It features the voice talents of Rod Taylor, J. Pat O&#x27;Malley, Betty Lou Gerson, Martha Wentworth, Ben Wright, Cate Bauer, Dave Frankham, and Fred Worlock. The film&#x27;s plot follows Pongo and Perdita, two Dalmatians who give birth to a litter of fifteen puppies, who are later kidnapped by the obsessive socialite Cruella de Vil, wanting to make their fur into coats. Pongo and Perdita set out on a cross-country rescue mission to save the litter from the maniacal Cruella. They rescue 84 additional Dalmatians in the process, bringing the total to 101.

&quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; was released in theaters on January 25, 1961, to positive reviews from critics and was a box-office success, grossing $14 million domestically in its original theatrical run. It became the first animated feature to earn over $10 million during its initial release, and became the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year in the North American box office and the highest-grossing animated film when reissues of films are not counted. Aside from its box-office revenue, the employment of inexpensive animation techniques, such as using xerography during the process of inking and painting traditional animation cels, kept production costs down. Counting reissues, the film grossed $303 million worldwide, and when adjusted for inflation, is the twelfth-highest-grossing film in the North American box office and the second-highest-grossing animated film globally. It is also the traditionally animated film that had the most ticket admissions at an estimated of over 199,800,000 sold tickets.

The success of the film made Disney expand it into a media franchise, with a live-action remake released in 1996, followed by a sequel in 2000. A direct-to-video animated sequel to the 1961 film, &quot;101 Dalmatians II: Patch&#x27;s London Adventure&quot;, was released in 2003. Two animated television series based on the franchise were also produced, with &quot;101 Dalmatians: The Series&quot; in 1997 and &quot;101 Dalmatian Street&quot; in 2019. A live-action reboot, &quot;Cruella&quot;, was released in 2021.

==Plot==

In 1957, aspiring songwriter Roger Radcliffe lives in a bachelor flat near Regent&#x27;s Park in London with his pet Dalmatian, Pongo. Deciding both of them need a &quot;mate&quot;, Pongo watches women and their dogs in the street. Noticing a young woman named Anita and her Dalmatian Perdita, he drags Roger to the park to arrange a meeting. Roger and Anita fall in love, and soon marry, with Pongo and Perdita attending.

The Radcliffes hire a nanny and move into a small townhouse near Regent&#x27;s Park. After Perdita becomes pregnant with a litter of 15 puppies, Anita&#x27;s fur-obsessed former schoolmate, Cruella de Vil, arrives and demands to know when the puppies will arrive. Roger responds by writing a jazzy song mocking her. A frightened Perdita confesses to Pongo that she now regrets the idea of having puppies due to Cruella wanting them. When the puppies are born, Cruella returns demanding to buy them. Roger firmly denies her offer and Cruella, refusing to take no for an answer, swears revenge storming out of the house.

Several weeks later, Cruella makes good on her threat and secretly hires Jasper and Horace Badun, two burglar brothers, to steal the puppies. When Scotland Yard is unable to find the puppies or prove Cruella was involved, Pongo and Perdita use the &quot;Twilight Bark&quot;, a canine gossip line, to solicit help from the other dogs in London, and eventually all of England.

On the farm of a retired cavalry officer, the Colonel, a military-like Old English Sheepdog, along with his feline compatriot Sergeant Tibbs, investigate the nearby &quot;Old De Vil Place&quot;, where puppies had been heard barking two nights earlier. Tibbs finds the puppies in the old mansion and learns that Cruella intends to make them into dog-skin fur coats. After the Colonel sends word back to London, Pongo and Perdita leave through a back window and begin a long cross-country journey, crossing an icy river and running through the snow toward Suffolk.

Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering the Baduns to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs helps the puppies escape through a hole in the wall, but the Baduns notice and give chase. Pongo and Perdita break into the house and confront the Baduns just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs fight the two men, the Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house. Following a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita discover there are 84 more puppies with them. Shocked at Cruella&#x27;s plans, they decide to adopt all the puppies, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them.

The Dalmatians start their homeward trek, pursued by the Baduns. They take shelter from a blizzard in a dairy farm with a friendly collie and four cows, then make their way to Dinsford, where they meet a Black Labrador waiting for them in a blacksmith&#x27;s shop. Cruella and the Baduns arrive, prompting Pongo to have his entire family roll in a sooty fireplace to disguise themselves as other Labradors. The Labrador helps them board a moving van bound for London, but melting snow falls on Lucky and clears the soot off of him, blowing the dogs&#x27; cover. Enraged, Cruella pursues the van in her car and tries to ram it off the road, but the Baduns, attempting to do the same with their lorry, end up colliding with her, resulting in Cruella and the Baduns getting stranded in a ditch with their vehicles destroyed as the van drives off.

In London, a depressed Nanny and the Radcliffes try to enjoy Christmas and the wealth they have acquired from the song about Cruella, which has become a big radio hit. The soot-covered Dalmatians suddenly flood the house. Upon removing the soot and counting the massive family of dogs, Roger chooses to use his songwriting royalties to buy a big house in the country so they can keep all 101 Dalmatians.

==Production==
===Story development===
The children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; by Dodie Smith had been published on November 19, 1956, to an immediate success. By February 1957, screenwriter Charles Brackett brought it to the attention of Walt Disney, who acquired the film rights to the novel on November 26 of that year (after lengthy negotiations) for $25,000. The project was set to be Disney&#x27;s next animated feature after &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (which was still in production at the time) and was originally expected to be finished within two years. Story artist Bill Peet was assigned to single-handedly develop the story, marking the first time a Disney animated film was written by one person. Disney also tasked Peet to write a detailed screenplay first before storyboarding; since Peet never learned to use a typewriter, he wrote the initial draft by hand on legal paper. The manuscript was completed and typed up within two months, after which, having received Disney&#x27;s approval, Peet began storyboarding and was charged with recording the voice-over process.

Peet closely followed the plot of Smith&#x27;s novel, but condensed some of its characters, which included Cruella&#x27;s husband and cat, as well as Cadpig, the female runt of Pongo and Missis&#x27; puppies, whose traits were transferred to Lucky in the final film. He also merged two Dalmatian mothers, birth mother Missis and adopted mother Perdita, into one, naming her after the latter; likewise, Nanny Cook and Nanny Butler from the novel were amalgamated into one character, simply named Nanny. The Colonel&#x27;s cat assistant was re-gendered from the female Pussy Willow into the male Sergeant Tibbs, and Horace Badun was renamed from Saul. Among other things, Peet retained a scene from the original book in which Pongo and Perdita exchange wedding vows in unison with their owners, who were also renamed from Mr. and Mrs. Dearly to Roger and Anita Radcliffe. However, after the censor board warned that it might offend certain religious audiences if the animals repeated the exact words of a solemn religious ceremony, it was reworked to be less religious, down to having Roger and Anita dressed in formal clothes. Also, the film&#x27;s original ending involved the newly rich Roger selling his song about Cruella and buying the Hell Hall to turn it into a Dalmatian Plantation, with Pongo and Perdita expecting another litter of puppies. It was ultimately cut short and rewritten to have Dalmatians reunite with their owners after they escape from Cruella.

Although Disney had not been as involved in the production of the animated films as frequently as in previous years, he was always present at story meetings. When Peet sent Dodie Smith some drawings of the characters, she wrote back saying that he had improved her story and that the designs looked better than the illustrations in the book.

===Casting===
The filmmakers deliberately cast actors with deeper voices for the roles of dogs, so they would have more power than those of the human characters. Rod Taylor, who had extensive radio experience, was one of the first actors cast in the film; he got the role of Pongo. Lisa Daniels was originally cast as Perdita and recorded about the third of her lines but then got married and moved to New York; Cate Bauer replaced her for the rest of the film. J. Pat O&#x27;Malley, who was a regular voice actor for the studio and one of Disney&#x27;s personal favorites, got the roles of Jasper and Colonel, and also voiced several minor characters in the film. David Frankham was cast as Sergeant Tibbs in the spring of 1959 and finished his recording within three sessions from May 1959 to January 1960; he was also asked to record the part of Scottie, the Skye Terrier who appears early in the &quot;Twilight Bark&quot; sequence.

Disney originally had Lisa Davis read for the role of Cruella De Vil, but she did not think that she was right for the part, and wanted to try reading the role of Anita instead. Disney agreed, and, after they read the script for a second time, she landed the part. Davis also provided live-action reference for the character. Betty Lou Gerson, who was previously the narrator for &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950), auditioned for the role of Cruella De Vil in front of Marc Davis, the character&#x27;s supervising animator, and sequence director Wolfgang Reitherman, and immediately landed it. While searching for the right accent of the character, she landed on a &quot;phony theatrical voice, someone who&#x27;s set sail from New York but hasn&#x27;t quite reached England.&quot; During the recording process, Gerson was thought to be imitating Tallulah Bankhead, but she later disputed that she &quot;didn&#x27;t intentionally imitate her ... We both had phony English accents on top of our Southern accents and a great deal of flair. So our voices came out that way.&quot; Gerson finished her recording sessions in fourteen days.

===Animation===
====Art direction====
After &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959) disappointed at the box office, Disney was losing money and there were discussions about closing down the animation department. During the film&#x27;s production, Disney told animator Eric Larson: &quot;I don&#x27;t think we can continue; it&#x27;s too expensive.&quot; Despite this, he still had deep feelings towards animation because he had built the company upon it.

Ub Iwerks, in charge of special processes at the studio, had been experimenting with Xerox photography to aid in animation. By 1959, he used a Xerox camera to transfer drawings by animators directly to animation cels, eliminating the inking process, thus saving time and money while preserving the spontaneity of the penciled elements. However, because of its limitations, the camera was unable to deviate from a black scratchy outline and lacked the fine lavish quality of hand inking. Disney would first use the Xerox process for a thorn forest in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and the first production to make full use of the process was &quot;Goliath II&quot; (1960). For &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, one of the benefits of the process was that it was a great help towards animating the spotted dogs. According to Chuck Jones, Disney was able to complete the film for about half of what it would have cost if they had had to animate all the dogs and spots.

Meanwhile, Ken Anderson, the studio&#x27;s art director, learned a television production studio—Hurrell Productions—was using Xerography to produce television commercials featuring Disney characters. Inspired by the aesthetic, Anderson experimented with a Xerox copier to directly transfer the animators&#x27; drawings onto transparent cels, thereby eliminating the inking process. Anderson screened an animation test to Disney and the animators; although Disney expressed concern at the graphic style, he gave his approval stating: &quot;Ah, yeah, yeah, you can fool around all you want to.&quot; For the stylized art direction, Anderson took inspiration from British cartoonist Ronald Searle, who once advised him to use a Mont Blanc pen and India ink for his artwork.

In addition to the character animation, Anderson also sought to use Xerography on &quot;the background painting because I was going to apply the same technique to the whole picture.&quot; Along with color stylist Walt Peregoy, the two had the line drawings be printed on a separate animation cel before being laid over the background, which gave the appearance similar to the Xeroxed animation. Disney disliked the artistic look of the film and felt he was losing the &quot;fantasy&quot; element of his animated films. In a meeting with the animation staff concerning future films, Disney angrily said, &quot;We&#x27;re never gonna have one of those goddamned things&quot;, referring to the film&#x27;s art direction; he also stated, &quot;Ken&#x27;s never going to be an art director again.&quot;

Anderson took this to heart, but Disney eventually forgave him on his final trip to the studio in late 1966. As Anderson recalled in an interview:

He looked very sick. I said, &quot;Gee, it&#x27;s great to see you, Walt,&quot; and he said, &quot;You know that thing you did on &quot;Dalmatians&quot;.&quot; He didn&#x27;t say anything else, but he just gave me this look, and I knew that all was forgiven and in his opinion, maybe what I did on &quot;Dalmatians&quot; wasn&#x27;t so bad. That was the last time I ever saw him. Then, a few weeks later, I learned he was gone.

====Character animation====
Marc Davis was the sole animator on Cruella De Vil. During production, Davis claimed her character was partly inspired by Bette Davis (no relation), Rosalind Russell, and Tallulah Bankhead. He took further influence from her voice actress, Betty Lou Gerson, whose cheekbones he added to the character. He later complimented, &quot;[t]hat [her] voice was the greatest thing I&#x27;ve ever had a chance to work with. A voice like Betty Lou&#x27;s gives you something to do. You get a performance going there, and if you don&#x27;t take advantage of it, you&#x27;re off your rocker&quot;. While her hair coloring originated from the illustrations in the novel, Davis found its disheveled style by looking &quot;through old magazines for hairdos from 1940 till now&quot;. Her coat was exaggerated to match her oversized personality, and the lining was red because &quot;there&#x27;s a devil image involved&quot;.

As with the previous Disney films, the actors provided live-action reference as an aid to the animators before the animation process begun. By January 1959, Mary Wickes, who had played the maid Katie in &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; serial &quot;Annette&quot;, was hired as a model for Cruella De Vil. The live-action reference for Nanny was provided by both Don Barclay and Barbara Luddy, who had voiced Lady in &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955) and Merryweather in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959). Helene Stanleywho had been a model for the titular character in &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1950) and Princess Aurora in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959)performed the live-action reference for Anita.

===Music===

&quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; was the first Disney animated feature film to be a non-musical. To have music involved in the narrative, Peet used an old theater trick by which the protagonist is a down-and-out songwriter. However, unlike the previous animated Disney films at the time, the songs were not composed by a team, but by Mel Leven who composed both lyrics and music. Previously, Leven had composed songs for the UPA animation studio in which animators, who transferred to work at the Disney studios, had recommended him to Walt Disney. His first assignment was to compose &quot;Cruella De Vil,&quot; of which Leven composed three versions. The final version used in the film was composed as a &quot;bluesy number&quot; before a meeting with Walt in forty-five minutes.

The other two songs included in the film are &quot;Kanine Krunchies Jingle&quot; (sung by Lucille Bliss, who voiced Anastasia Tremaine in Disney&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Cinderella&quot;), and &quot;Dalmatian Plantation&quot; in which Roger sings only two lines at its closure. Leven had also written additional songs that were not included in the film. The first song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Buy a Parrot from a Sailor,&quot; a cockney chant, was meant to be sung by Jasper and Horace at the De Vil Mansion. A second song, &quot;Cheerio, Good-Bye, Toodle-oo, Hip Hip!&quot; was to be sung by the dalmatian puppies as they make their way into London. A third song titled &quot;March of the One Hundred and One&quot; was meant for the dogs to sing after escaping Cruella by van. Different, longer versions of &quot;Kanine Krunchies Jingle&quot; and &quot;Dalmatian Plantation&quot; appear on the Disneyland Records read-along album based on the film.

The Sherman Brothers wrote a title song, &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;, but it was not used in the film. The song has been released on other Disney recordings, however.

==Release==
===Original theatrical run===
&quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; premiered and was released in theaters on January 25, 1961, accompanied by the documentary &quot;The Horse with the Flying Tail&quot; (1960). To promote the film, an updated version of the 1957 &quot;Disneyland&quot; episode &quot;The Best Doggoned Dog in the World&quot; was aired on ABC on February 12, 1961, featuring the footage from &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; instead of scenes from &quot;Old Yeller&quot; (1957).

During its initial theatrical run, the film grossed $14 million in the United States and Canada, which generated $6.2 million in distributor rentals. It was the first animated feature to earn more than $10 million on its initial release, as well as the most popular film of the year in France, with admissions of 14.7 million ranking tenth on their all-time list. The box-office success of &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; allowed to pull the studio&#x27;s animation department out of the financial slump caused by the underperformance of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; two years prior; despite this, it did nothing to rekindle Disney&#x27;s fading interest in animation, with him being more focused on working on Disneyland and producing live-action films by then.

===Re-releases===

==Reception==
===Critical response===
In its initial release, &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; received acclaim from critics, many of whom hailed it as the studio&#x27;s best release since &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) and the closest to a real &quot;Disney&quot; film in many years. Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;While the story moves steadily toward a stark, melodramatic &quot;chase&quot; climax, it remains enclosed in a typical Disney frame of warm family love, human and canine.&quot; However, he later opined that the &quot;[s]ongs are scarce, too. A few more would have braced the final starkness.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; claimed that &quot;While not as indelibly enchanting or inspired as some of the studio&#x27;s most unforgettable animated endeavors, this is nonetheless a painstaking creative effort.&quot; A review in &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised the film as &quot;the wittiest, most charming, least pretentious cartoon feature Walt Disney has ever made.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; felt all children and adults will be &quot;highly entertained by Walt Disney&#x27;s latest, a semi-sophisticated, laugh-provoking, all cartoon, feature-lengther in Technicolor.&quot; Dodie Smith also enjoyed the film where she particularly praised the animation and backgrounds of the film.

Contemporary reviews have remained positive. Reviewing the film during its 1991 re-release, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, while giving the film three stars out of four, asserted that &quot;it&#x27;s an uneven film, with moments of inspiration in a fairly conventional tale of kidnapping and rescue. This is not one of the great Disney classics - it&#x27;s not in the same league with &quot;Snow White&quot; or &quot;Pinocchio&quot; - but it&#x27;s passable fun, and will entertain its target family audiences.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film critic Gene Siskel, in his 1991 review, also gave the film three stars out of four. Ralph Novak of &quot;People&quot; wrote &quot;What it lacks in romantic extravagance and plush spectacle, this 1961 Disney film makes up for in quiet charm and subtlety. In fact, if any movie with dogs, cats, and horses who talk can be said to belong in the realm of realistic drama, this is it.&quot; However, in 2011, Craig Berman of MSNBC ranked it and its 1996 remake as two of the worst children&#x27;s films of all time, saying that, &quot;The plot itself is a bit nutty. Making a coat out of dogs? Who does that? But worse than Cruella de Vil&#x27;s fashion sense is the fact that your children will definitely start asking for a Dalmatian of their own for their next birthday.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average score of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;With plenty of pooches and a memorable villain (Cruella De Vil), this is one of Disney&#x27;s most enduring, entertaining animated films.&quot; 

Cruella De Vil ranked 39th on AFI&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains&quot;.

==Legacy==
Since the original release of &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; in 1961, Disney has taken the property in various directions.

=== Television series ===
In 1996, it was announced that an animated television series based on the film would be created through a partnership between Disney and Kellogg’s. Co-produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and Jumbo Pictures, &quot;101 Dalmatians: The Series&quot; aired in syndication and on ABC from 1997 to 1998.

&quot;101 Dalmatian Street&quot; is the second TV series with a plot in the 21st century, with a new art style and a concept loosely based on the source material. Set 60 years after the original film, the show mostly focuses on a completely new family of Dalmatians, (who are descendants of Pongo and Perdita) who all live without a human in Camden Town.

=== Sequel ===
A direct-to-video sequel to the original animated film, &quot;101 Dalmatians II: Patch&#x27;s London Adventure&quot;, was released in 2003. The main focus of the sequel is Patch, the loneliest of puppies, feeling &quot;lost in a sea of spots&quot;. After he gets left behind during the Radcliffe&#x27;s moving day, he encounters his TV hero, Thunderbolt, who enlists him on a publicity campaign.

=== Live-action adaptations ===
A live-action remake of the 1961 film, &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;, was released in 1996; unlike the animated film, none of the animals had speaking voices in this version. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot;, in 2000. A live-action version of Cruella De Vil is featured as one of the main antagonists in the fourth season of the fantasy television series, &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; (produced by Disney-owned ABC Studios). Cruella is one of the four main villains in the 2015 television film &quot;Descendants&quot;, which follows the teenage children of Disney&#x27;s iconic heroes and villains (including Cruella&#x27;s son, Carlos). A 2021 live-action reboot, &quot;Cruella&quot;, focuses on the origin of the eponymous character. A sequel to this film is currently in development.

=== Other media ===
The characters from &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; make cameo appearances in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, with Cruella De Vil featured as one of the main villains in the stand-alone feature &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot; (2002). Like other Walt Disney Animation Studios characters, the film&#x27;s characters have cameo appearances in the short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot; (2023).

In the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game, a side quest consists of Sora tracking down the 99 puppies whose world has been destroyed and returning them to Pongo and Perdita, who have been given shelter in Traverse Town by Squall Leonhart.

<doc id="179353" wikidata="Q516858" url="?curid=179353" title="Henry Ford II">
<text>Henry Ford II (September 4, 1917 – September 29, 1987), commonly known as Hank the Deuce, was an American businessman in the automotive industry. He was the oldest son of Edsel Ford I and oldest grandson of Henry Ford. He served as president of the Ford Motor Company from 1945 to 1960, chief executive officer (CEO) from 1947 to 1979, and chairman of the board of directors from 1960 to 1980. Under his leadership, Ford Motor Company became a publicly traded corporation in 1956. From 1943 to 1950, he also served as president of the Ford Foundation.

==Early life and education==
Henry Ford II was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Eleanor Clay Ford and Edsel Ford on September 4, 1917. He, brothers Benson and William, and sister Josephine, grew up amid affluence. He graduated from The Hotchkiss School in 1936. He attended Yale University, where he served on the business staff of &quot;The Yale Record&quot;, the campus humor magazine, but left in 1940 before graduation. During this time, he became a member of the Zeta Psi fraternity.

==Career==
When his father Edsel, president of Ford, died of cancer in May 1943 (during World War II), Henry Ford II was serving in the Navy and unable to inherit the presidency of the family-owned business. The elderly and ailing Henry Ford I, company founder, re-assumed the presidency, though mentally inconsistent, suspicious, and considered no longer fit for the presidency position by most of the company&#x27;s directors. For the previous 20 years, although he had long been without any official executive title, the elder Ford kept &quot;de facto&quot; control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him, and he served until the end of the war. During this period, the company began to decline, losing over $10 million a month (). The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt considered a government acquisition of the company to ensure continued war production, but the idea never progressed to execution.

Henry Ford II left the Navy in July 1943 and joined the company&#x27;s management a few weeks later. He assumed presidency of the business on September 21, 1945. Since it had been assumed that Edsel Ford would continue in his capacity as president of the company for much longer than turned out to be the case, Henry Ford II had received little preparation for the position, and he inherited the company during a chaotic period; its European factories had suffered a great deal of damage during the war, and domestic sales were in decline.

Henry Ford II immediately adopted an aggressive management style. One of his first acts as company president was to place John Bugas in charge of company management, dismissing much of his grandfather&#x27;s inner circle, especially Harry Bennett, chief of the Ford Service Department, whom the elder Ford had hired in 1921 to oversee security at the vast Ford Rouge Plant complex, and nearly two decades later had become a lightning rod in efforts to prevent unionization of the Ford labor force, by violent means if necessary. Next, acknowledging his inexperience, Henry II hired several seasoned executives to support him. He hired former General Motors executives Ernest Breech and Lewis Crusoe away from the Bendix Corporation. Breech was to serve in the coming years as the young Ford&#x27;s business mentor, and the Breech–Crusoe team would form the core of Ford&#x27;s business expertise, offering much-needed experience.

Additionally, Ford hired ten young up-and-comers, known as the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;. These ten, gleaned from an Army Air Forces statistical team, Ford envisioned as giving the company the ability to innovate and stay current. Two of them, Arjay Miller and Robert McNamara, went on to serve as presidents of Ford themselves. A third member, J. Edward Lundy, served in key financial roles for several decades and helped to establish Ford Finance&#x27;s position as a major worldwide financial operation. As a team, the &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; are probably best remembered as the design team for the 1949 Ford, which they took from concept to production in 19 months, and which re-established Ford as a formidable automotive company. It was reported that 100,000 orders for this car were taken the day it was introduced to the market.

Ford became president and CEO of Ford Motor Company in 1945. In 1956, the company became a publicly traded corporation and dedicated its new world headquarters building. During his term as CEO of Ford, he lived in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. On July 13, 1960, he was elected chairman before resigning as president on November 9, 1960. He would resign as CEO on October 1, 1979, and as chairman on March 13, 1980. His nephew, William Clay Ford Jr. would later assume these positions after 20 years of non-Ford family management of the company. During this interim, the family&#x27;s interests were represented on the board by Henry&#x27;s younger brother William Clay Ford Sr., as well as Henry&#x27;s son Edsel Ford II and his nephew William Clay Ford Jr.

During the early 1960s Ford engaged in lengthy negotiations with Enzo Ferrari to buy Ferrari, with a view to expanding Ford&#x27;s presence in motorsport in general and at the Le Mans 24 Hours in particular. However, negotiations collapsed due to disputes over control of Ferrari&#x27;s Scuderia Ferrari racing division. The collapse of the deal led him to launch the Ford GT40 project, intended to end Ferrari&#x27;s dominance at Le Mans (the Italian marque won the race six consecutive times from 1960 to 1965). In 1966, after two difficult years in 1964 and 1965, the GT40 Mark IIs locked out the podium at both the Daytona 24 Hours and the Sebring 12 Hours before taking the first of four consecutive wins at Le Mans.
In the late 1960s, Ford became personally involved in the development of the Lincoln Continental Mark III. He gave his enthusiastic approval for both the final exterior and interior designs. The result was a Ford Motor Company flagship that single-handedly made Lincoln profitable and spawned a three-decade market rivalry between the Lincoln Mark series and Cadillac&#x27;s Eldorado series. During this time, Ford also reformed the company&#x27;s European operations, merging the previously separate (and competing) British and German subsidiaries into a single Ford of Europe with a common product line and merged manufacturing operations. During the 1970s, Ford of Europe expanded substantially, with new factories in Saarlouis and Valencia, the latter becoming one of Ford&#x27;s biggest plants outside the US.

In 1973–74, as it became clear that the U.S. automobile market would begin to favor smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, Ford&#x27;s then-President Lee Iacocca was highly interested in buying powertrains from Honda Motor Company as a way to minimize the cost of developing a small Ford car for the North American market, such as a modified version of Ford of Europe&#x27;s Ford Fiesta. The plan was rejected by Henry Ford II, who said, &quot;No car with my name on the hood is going to have a Jap engine inside.&quot; Although the Ford Motor Company had been selling a Mazda compact pickup truck as the Ford Courier since late 1971, Ford did not like the idea of flagship North American passenger car models moving in that direction. Ford Motor Company did go on to adapt to the era in which Japanese, German, and American participation in a globalized automobile industry became tightly integrated. For example, Ford&#x27;s relationship with Mazda was well developed even before the end of Henry Ford II&#x27;s period of influence. However, in Iacocca&#x27;s view, it lagged several years behind GM and Chrysler, due to Henry Ford II&#x27;s unappealable influence, before others led it forward despite his resistance.

Henry Ford II&#x27;s management style caused the company&#x27;s fortunes to fluctuate in more ways than one. For example, he allowed the offering of public stock in 1956, which raised $650 million for the company (), but the &quot;experimental car&quot; program instituted during his tenure, the Edsel, cost the company almost half that. Likewise, Henry Ford II hired the creative Lee Iacocca, who was fundamental to the success of the Ford Mustang, in 1964, but fired him due to personal disputes in 1978 (about the break in their relationship, Iacocca quoted Ford as saying, &quot;Sometimes you just don&#x27;t like somebody.&quot;) Iacocca later retorted, &quot;If a guy is over 25 percent a jerk, he&#x27;s in trouble. And Henry was 95 percent.&quot; Ford II formally retired from all positions at Ford Motor Company on October 1, 1982, upon reaching the company&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of 65, but remained the ultimate source of authority at Ford until his death in 1987.

<doc id="179354" wikidata="Q7770724" url="?curid=179354" title="The Turbans">
<text>The Turbans were an American doo-wop vocal group that formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1953. The original members were: Al Banks (lead tenor), Matthew Platt (second tenor), Charlie Williams (baritone), and Andrew &quot;Chet&quot; Jones (bass). They came from Downtown Philadelphia (around Bainbridge and South Street).

Around Christmas of 1954, they won first prize in a talent contest singing their rendition of &quot;White Christmas&quot;. This created interest among the local record companies, and in the late spring of 1955, they cut a demo record. Herman Gillespie, the group&#x27;s first manager, took the demo record to Al Silver at Herald Records in New York City. They signed a contract in July 1955, and gained a new manager, Allen Best. Best worked for Shaw Artists Corporation.

==&quot;When You Dance&quot;==
During July 1955, the Turbans had their first Herald recording session, and later that month their first record, pairing &quot;Let Me Show You (Around My Heart)&quot; as the &quot;A&quot; side with &quot;When You Dance&quot; as the flip side, was released. Although &quot;Let Me Show You&quot; became a regional hit in Atlanta, Cleveland Pittsburgh, Detroit, Boston, and New Orleans, interest began to grow in &quot;When You Dance&quot;. At first it started to break in New York City, Philadelphia, Washington D.C. and Baltimore, until finally, in November, it hit the national R&amp;B and Pop charts. &quot;When You Dance&quot; reached No. 3 on the R&amp;B chart, and remained there for about two months. It only rose to No. 33 on the pop chart, but stayed there for about five months, so it was counted as a significant hit.

==Late 1955–early 1956==
In December 1955, Herald Records released &quot;Sister Sooky/I’ll Always Watch Over You&quot; as a follow-up record, but this failed to chart. With one national hit, however, in late January 1956, they went on a tour, joining Irvin Feld’s &quot;Super Attractions Tour&quot;. Then in March 1956, they joined another tour, which featured Roy Gaines, Guitar Slim, Margie Day, and Lloyd Lambert.

They then became part of the &quot;Rhythm And Blues Show Of 1956&quot; and in April 1956, &quot;I’m Nobody’s&quot;/&quot;B-I-N-G-O&quot; was released, but this did not make the national charts. By July, they were touring the Midwest with Sonny Boy Williamson’s orchestra. In August 1956, &quot;It Was A Night Like This&quot;/&quot;All Of My Love&quot; was released, but this record also failed to make the national charts. Finally, on October 21, they played the Circle Theater in Cleveland, with Don Rello, the Quails and Ralph Wilson&#x27;s orchestra.

==1957==
As 1957 dawned, with no more hit records, the Turbans were running out of work. They were back in the studio in early 1957, but two more sessions failed to produce any hit records. By July 1957, their contract with Herald Records expired. This lack of success led to personnel changes, some of which were temporary, some of which were permanent.

==Red Top records==
In late 1958, the now-reconstructed Turbans signed with Red Top Records. Matthew Platt and Charlie Williams had been replaced by Earl Worsham (first and second tenor) and John Christian (baritone/second tenor), both of whom had sung with the Quadrells. They released a single called &quot;I Promise You&quot;/&quot;Curfew Time.&quot; Again, both sides were led by Banks. This record failed to chart, so the Turbans did no further recording for about two years. Jones left the group for a while, and they continued on as a trio.

==Early 1960s and Roulette records==
In 1960, they moved to Morris Levy’s Roulette Records. Jones returned, and they recorded &quot;Diamonds And Pearls,&quot; backed with &quot;Bad Man&quot;. It was a group called the Paradons, though, who had a hit with the song. In January 1961, their second (and final) Roulette release was &quot;Three Friends&quot; (written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David), backed with &quot;I’m Not Your Fool Anymore&quot;. This again failed to chart.

==Parkway records==
The next stop for the Turbans was Bernie Lowe’s and Kal Mann’s Parkway Records. By this time, Jones, one of the mainstays of the group, had departed. The group was now Al Banks, Earl Worsham, John Christian, and newly-added bass, Reggie &quot;Tootie&quot; Price. At Parkway, they recorded an updated version of &quot;When You Dance,&quot; released in February 1961 to compete with the re-released original Herald version.

In the spring of 1960, the original Herald version of &quot;When You Dance&quot; had been included on the second volume of Art Laboe’s &quot;Oldies But Goodies&quot; album series. It created enough demand for Herald to re-release the original single in February 1961. It was not a big hit the second time around, but it still managed to struggle to No. 114 on the Pop charts.

==Imperial records==
Later in 1961, with no chart success at Parkway Records, they signed with Imperial Records. Price left, and was replaced by James Oscar &quot;Cisco&quot; Williams, (a bass/baritone/tenor), who had also been with the Quadrells. The group was now a quintet, with the fifth member being tenor William &quot;Sonny&quot; Gordon, who had been the lead of the Angels in 1954.

Their first Imperial release was &quot;Six Questions&quot; (led by Banks), backed with &quot;The Lament Of Silver Gulch&quot;. In March 1962, there was a second Imperial release, &quot;This Is My Story&quot;/&quot;Clicky Clicky Clack,&quot; both sides featuring Banks. The final Turbans’ record appeared in May 1962: &quot;I Wonder&quot;/&quot;The Damage Is Done,&quot; with Sonny Gordon taking the lead on both sides. None of these three releases charted.

==The Turbans break up==
After Imperial, the Turbans broke up for good. Worsham went off to Billy Byrd&#x27;s Ink Spots, and then he sang with a Coasters group based in Boca Raton. Banks was with Charlie Thomas&#x27; Drifters in the early 1970s.

Andrew &quot;Al&quot; Banks died in July 1977.

William &quot;Sonny&quot; Gordon died on January 2, 1986.

John Christian Died in 1996.

Andrew &quot;Chet&quot; Jones died on June 25, 1998

Earl Worsham died on June 20, 2007.

<doc id="179359" wikidata="Q647175" url="?curid=179359" title="Teriyaki">
<text>Teriyaki is a cooking technique in which foods are broiled or grilled with a glaze of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Although commonly associated with Japanese cuisine, this cooking technique is also commonly used in other Asian cuisines such as Chinese, Indonesian and Thai.

Fish – yellowtail, marlin, skipjack tuna, salmon, trout, and mackerel – and chicken is mainly used in Japan, while white and red other meat – pork, lamb, and beef – is more often used in the West. Other ingredients sometimes used in Japan include squid, hamburger steak, and meatballs.

The word &quot;teriyaki&quot; derives from the noun , which refers to a shine or luster given by the sugar content in the , and , which refers to the cooking method of grilling or broiling. Traditionally the meat is dipped in or brushed with sauce several times during cooking. It is believed that Teriyaki in Japan evolved during the 1600s.

The is traditionally made by blending soy sauce, sake (or mirin), and sugar over heat. The sauce is boiled and reduced to the desired thickness, then used to marinate meat, which is then grilled or broiled. Sometimes ginger is added and the final dish may be garnished with spring onions.

==Variations==
A is a variety of hamburger either topped with teriyaki sauce or with the sauce worked into the ground meat patty. According to George Motz, the dish has its roots in Japan.

&quot;Teriyaki stir-fry&quot; refers to stir frying meat or vegetables and tossing them in teriyaki sauce. Vegetarian ingredients may also be cooked teriyaki-style. 

== By country ==
=== United States ===
==== Teriyaki sauce ====
In North America, any dish made with a teriyaki-like sauce is described using the word teriyaki. This often even includes those using foreign alternatives to &quot;sake&quot; or &quot;mirin&quot;, or with added ingredients, such as sesame or garlic (uncommon in traditional Japanese cuisine). The sauce used for teriyaki is generally sweet, although it can also be spicy. Pineapple juice is sometimes used, as it not only provides sweetness but also bromelain enzymes that help tenderize the meat. Grilling meat first and pouring the sauce on afterwards or using sweet sauce as a marinade are other non-traditional methods of cooking teriyaki. Teriyaki sauce is sometimes put on chicken wings or used as a dipping sauce.

==== Seattle teriyaki ====

In the city of Seattle, Washington, a large teriyaki culture emerged in the 1990s. , there were over 83 restaurants in the city with &quot;teriyaki&quot; in their name. It has been described as the city&#x27;s signature cuisine by some outlets, noting its widespread adoption as a form of fast food.

The first standalone teriyaki restaurant, Toshi&#x27;s Teriyaki, opened in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle in 1976. The restaurant&#x27;s low-cost chicken and beef skewers in teriyaki sauce inspired other restaurants in the area. Toshi&#x27;s later expanded into a chain with 17 locations in the Seattle area by 1996.

<doc id="179362" wikidata="Q1045910" url="?curid=179362" title="Mirin">
<text>is a type of rice wine and a common ingredient in Japanese cooking. It is similar to sake but with a lower alcohol content and higher sugar content. The sugar content is a complex carbohydrate that forms naturally during the fermentation process; no sugars are added. The alcohol content is further lowered when the liquid is heated.

==Types==
Three types of products are marketed as &quot;mirin&quot;. The first is &quot;hon mirin&quot; (literally: true mirin), which contains about 14% alcohol and is produced by a 40 to 60 day mashing (saccharification) process. The second is &quot;shio mirin&quot; (literally: salt mirin), which contains a minimum of 1.5% salt to prevent consumption in order to avoid alcohol tax.

The third are &quot;mirin&quot;-like seasonings called &quot;shin mirin&quot; (literally: new mirin), or &quot;mirin-fu chomiryo&quot; (literally: mirin-like seasoning), which are substitutes not actually &quot;mirin&quot;. They are blends of sweetener syrups, flavorings such as kōji extracts, and flavour enhancers. They contain less than 1% alcohol.

The term or trade name &quot;aji-mirin&quot; (literally: taste mirin) can mean various things, such as salt mirin, synthetic mirin, or &quot;mirin&quot;-like seasonings.

==Uses==
In the Edo period, mirin was consumed as &quot;amazake&quot;. O-toso, traditionally consumed for the Japanese New Year, can be made by soaking a spice mixture in mirin.

In the Kansai style of cooking, mirin is briefly boiled before use, allowing some alcohol to evaporate. In the Kantō regional style, the mirin is used untreated. Kansai-style boiled mirin is called &quot;nikiri mirin&quot; () (literally: thoroughly boiled mirin).

Mirin adds a bright touch to grilled or broiled fish or erases the fishy smell. A small amount is often used instead of sugar and soy sauce. It is sometimes used to accompany sushi.

Mirin is also an ingredient in other sauces:
* &quot;Kabayaki &quot; (grilled eel) sauce: mirin, soy sauce, sake, sugar, fish bone (optional)
* &quot;Nikiri mirin &quot;sauce: soy sauce, dashi, mirin, sake, in a ratio of 10:2:1:1 
* &quot;Sushi su &quot;(sushi rice vinaigrette): rice wine vinegar, sugar, &quot;nikiri mirin&quot; sauce
*Teriyaki sauce

<doc id="179373" wikidata="Q6358686" url="?curid=179373" title="Kamkorp">
<text>The Kamkorp Group was a privately held holding company, encompassing a wide range of businesses but operates mainly as Frazer-Nash Research Ltd. It was owned by UK-based Indian businessman Kamal Siddiqi. Over the past 25 years, the Kamkorp Group has developed proprietary digital electric and hybrid electric powertrains and products for the transportation and industrial markets. The company has produced various automobile prototypes under the brands Frazer-Nash and Metrocab. Until 2020 it owned Bristol Cars, under which brand the Bristol Bullet sports car was being developed. The Bullet was unveiled on 26 July 2016 and production was to have started in 2017.

In July 2018, Frazer-Nash Research Limited was ordered by the court to be wound-up, and in November 2018 a liquidator was appointed in order to liquidate the company. In January 2020 Kamkorp Limited was also ordered by the court to be wound-up, and in February 2020 a liquidator was appointed in order to liquidate the company.

==Frazer-Nash Research Limited (FNR)==
Frazer-Nash Research Limited (FNR) was a British Research and Development company and the powerhouse of the Kamkorp Group of Companies. FNR develops projects from concept through to low volume production. In-house capabilities include mechanics, electronics, software, electrical, industrial and automotive engineering.
All components of FN Range-Extended Electric powertrain are designed in-house, using systems and sub-systems developed and built within the Group companies.

===Range-Extended Electric Powertrain===
FNR developed a Range-Extended Electric (REE) powertrain that has been applied to a variety of vehicle platforms from city cars to low-cost mass-transit monorails. 
These are electric vehicles, with an internal combustion engine (range extender) powering a matched generator as an auxiliary power unit, charging the battery pack and/or providing energy directly to the electric motors.

===Applications===

The technology has been applied to a range of vehicle platforms and products by FNR, and by others developed in partnership.

===1990s===

====Solar Baby====
A zero emission people mover which was assembled in Malaysia through a joint venture company, Perusahaan Otomobil Elektrik (POEM).

====Go Kart====
The electric Go Kart was Frazer-Nash Research&#x27;s first electric drive product.

===2000s===

====Sense City Car====
An electric vehicle (EV) designed for city and urban use.

====Road Train====
The Road Runner had 12-motors, 4 per carriage, and could carry 45 passengers.

====Windsor====
The Windsor was designed for golf courses and large estates.

===2010s===
Frazer-Nash Research collaborated with Proton Cars of Malaysia to produce electric-powered prototypes of its Saga, Persona and Exora vehicles which subsequently participated in the RAC 2011 Brighton to London Future Car Challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011 RAC Future Car Challenge 11/2011 paultan.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Winners were determined by fuel efficiency and least polluting. The Proton Exora won in its category for two consecutive years.

The Frazer-Nash Namir, a prototype of a two-seater supercar claimed to be the &quot;world’s fastest hybrid&quot;, was presented at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. It was stated it was capable of 187 mph with economy of 160mpg. According to Autocar magazine, &quot;Frazer-Nash developed and supplied the four-motor powertrain, while Italdesign Giugiaro engineered and built everything else, from suspension to the carbonfibre tub.&quot; The prototype performed a demonstration run at the Goodwood Festival of Speed later in 2009.

The Metrail Monorail system, with its core Frazer-Nash powertrain technology, utilises the latest advances in microelectronics, lightweight composite materials and computerised traction systems. The Metrail system benefits from a self-contained on board energy system, ruling out the need for a ‘third rail’.

The Metrocab is a Zero emissions capable taxi trialled in London. The Metrocab, like most of the above applications has the core FN powertrain technology. The taxi is driven by two electric motors, with a 1-litre petrol engine used to recharge the battery pack, coupled with an optimised generator. Charging whilst on the go takes as little as 10 minutes, alternative charging can be achieved via any electric mains outlet.

==Notable group milestones==

=== 1991: Frazer-Nash Research New Ownership ===

<doc id="179375" wikidata="Q245068" url="?curid=179375" title="Comedian">
<text>A comedian (feminine comedienne) or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting foolishly (as in slapstick), or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comedian.

A popular saying often attributed to Ed Wynn states: &quot;A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny.&quot; This draws a distinction between how much of the comedy can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.

Since the 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called alternative comedy, has grown in popularity with its more offbeat and experimental style. This normally involves more experiential, or observational reporting (e.g., Alexei Sayle, Daniel Tosh, Malcolm Hardee). As far as content is concerned, comedians such as Tommy Tiernan, Des Bishop, Kevin Hart, and Dawn French draw on their background to poke fun at themselves, while others such as Jon Stewart, Ben Elton and Sarah Silverman have very strong political and cultural undertones.

Many comics achieve a cult following while touring famous comedy hubs such as the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal, the Edinburgh Fringe, and Melbourne Comedy Festival in Australia. Often a comic&#x27;s career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the Edinburgh Comedy Award (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known (e.g., Eddie Izzard, Lee Evans). A comic&#x27;s stand-up success does not always correlate to a film&#x27;s critical or box-office success.

==History==
===Ancient Greeks===

Comedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when Aristophanes, a comic author, and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes&#x27; comedy style took the form of satyr plays.

===Shakespearean comedy===

The English poet and playwright William Shakespeare wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare&#x27;s other plays.

===Modern era===

American performance comedy has its roots in the 1840s from the three-act, variety show format of minstrel shows (via blackface performances of the Jim Crow character); Frederick Douglass criticized these shows for profiting from and perpetuating racism. Minstrelsy monologists performed second-act, stump-speech monologues from within minstrel shows until 1896. American standup also emerged in vaudeville theatre from the 1880s to the 1930s, with such comics as W. C. Fields, Buster Keaton and the Marx Brothers.

British performance comedy has its roots in 1850 music hall theatres, where Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, and Dan Leno first performed, mentored by comedian and theatre impresario Fred Karno, who developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s and also pioneered slapstick comedy.

==Media==
In the modern era, as technology produced forms of mass communications media, these were adapted to entertainment and comedians adapted to the new media, sometimes switching to new forms as they were introduced.

===Stand-up===
Stand-up comedy is a comic monologue performed standing on a stage. Bob Hope became the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century in a nearly 80-year career that included numerous comedy film roles over a five-decade span in radio, television, and entertaining armed-service troops through the USO. Other noted stand-up comedians include Lenny Bruce, Billy Connolly, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Victoria Wood, Joan Rivers, Whoopi Goldberg and Jo Brand.

===Audio recording===

Some of the earliest commercial sound recordings were made by standup comedians such as Cal Stewart, who recorded collections of his humorous monologues on Edison Records as early as 1898, and other labels until his death in 1919.

Bandleader Spike Jones recorded 15 musical comedy albums satirizing popular and classical music from 1950 to his death in 1965. Tom Lehrer wrote and recorded five albums of songs satirizing political and social issues from 1953 to 1965. Musician Peter Schickele, inspired by Jones, parodied classical music with 17 albums of his music which he presented as written by &quot;P.D.Q. Bach&quot; (fictional son of Johann Sebastian Bach) from 1965 through 2007.

In 1968, radio surreal comedy group The Firesign Theatre revolutionized the concept of the spoken comedy album by writing and recording elaborate radio plays employing sound effects and multitrack recording, which comedian Robin Williams called &quot;the audio equivalent of a Hieronymous Bosch painting.&quot; Comedy duo Cheech and Chong recorded comedy albums in a similar format from 1971 through 1985.

===Film===

Karno took Chaplin and Laurel on two trips to the United States to tour the vaudeville circuit. On the second one, they were recruited by the fledgling silent film industry. Chaplin became the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and Stan Laurel were protégés of Fred Karno, the English theatre impresario of British music hall, and in his biography Laurel stated, &quot;Fred Karno didn&#x27;t teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it&quot;. Chaplin wrote films such as &quot;Modern Times&quot; and &quot;The Kid&quot;. His films still have a major impact on comedy in films today.

Laurel met Oliver Hardy in the US and teamed up as Laurel and Hardy. Keaton also started making silent comedies.

Fields appeared in Broadway musical comedies, three silent films in 1915 and 1925, and in sound films starting in 1926. The Marx brothers also made the transition to film in 1929, by way of two Broadway musicals.

Many other comedians made sound films, such as Bob Hope (both alone, and in a series of &quot;Road to ...&quot; comedies with partner Bing Crosby), ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, and Jerry Lewis (both with and without partner Dean Martin).

Some comedians who entered film expanded their acting skills to become dramatic actors, or started as actors specializing in comic roles, such as Dick Van Dyke, Paul Lynde, Michael Keaton, Bill Murray and Denis Leary.

===Radio===

Radio comedy began in the United States when Raymond Knight launched &quot;The Cuckoo Hour&quot; on NBC in 1930, along with the 1931 network debut of Stoopnagle and Budd on CBS. Most of the Hollywood comedians who did not become dramatic actors (e.g. Bergen, Fields, Groucho and Chico Marx, Red Skelton, Jack Benny, Fred Allen, Judy Canova, Hope, Martin and Lewis), transitioned to United States radio in the 1930s and 1940s.

Without a Hollywood supply of comedians to draw from, radio comedy did not begin in the United Kingdom until a generation later, with such popular 1950s shows as &quot;The Goon Show&quot; and &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. Later, radio became a proving-ground for many later United Kingdom comedians. Chris Morris began his career in 1986 at Radio Cambridgeshire, and Ricky Gervais began his comedy career in 1997 at London radio station XFM. &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, Mitchell and Webb and The Mighty Boosh all transferred to television after broadcasting on BBC Radio 4.

===Television===

On television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include Jay Leno, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Graham Norton, Jim Jefferies, James Corden, John Oliver, Jonathan Ross, David Letterman, and Chelsea Handler. There are sketch comedies, such as &quot;Mr. Show with Bob and David&quot; and Monty Python who created their sketch comedy show &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; (a BBC show that influenced &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;), and sitcoms, such as &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, and &quot;Not Going Out&quot;, as well as popular panel shows like &quot;The Big Fat Quiz of the Year&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, and &quot;Celebrity Juice&quot;. The most acclaimed sitcoms include &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.

===Internet===
Comedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Several comedians got their start through the internet such as Bo Burnham . Comedians streaming videos of their stand-up include Bridget Christie, Louis C.K. and Daniel Kitson.

==Jokes==
There are many established formats for jokes. One example is the pun or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; often used puns and double-entendre. Stewart Francis and Tim Vine are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience&#x27;s expectations through a misleading setup (known as a &#x27;pull back and reveal&#x27; in the UK and a &#x27;leadaway&#x27; in the US). Ed Byrne is an example of a comedian who has used this technique. Some jokes are based on ad absurdum extrapolations, for example much of Richard Herring and Ross Noble&#x27;s standup. In ironic humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of Danielle Ward). Other joke forms include observation (Michael McIntyre), whimsy (David O&#x27;Doherty), self-deprecation (Robin Williams) and parody (Diane Morgan).

==Personality traits==
In a January 2014 study, conducted in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of psychotic personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from Australia, Britain, and the United States. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored &quot;significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs.&quot; Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford and leader of the study claimed, &quot;the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis—both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&quot; However, labeling comedians&#x27; personality traits as &quot;psychotic&quot; does not mean that individual is a psychopath, since psychopathy is distinct from psychosis, and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.

==Highest-paid comedians==

&quot;Forbes&quot; publishes an annual list of the most financially successful comedians in the world, similarly to their Celebrity 100 list. Their data sources include Nielsen Media Research, Pollstar, Box Office Mojo and IMDb. The list was topped by Jerry Seinfeld from 2006 until 2015, who lost the title to Kevin Hart in 2016. In that year, the eight highest paid comedians were from the United States, including Amy Schumer, who became the first woman to be listed in the top ten. The top ten of 2016 are as follows:

<text>, somyeon (), or sùmiàn () is a very thin noodle made of wheat flour, less than 1.3 mm in diameter. The noodles are used extensively in East Asian cuisines. Japanese &quot;sōmen&quot; is made by stretching the dough with vegetable oil, forming thin strands that are then air dried for later use. This is distinct from a similar thin noodle, &quot;hiyamugi&quot;, which is knife-cut.

In Japan, &quot;sōmen&quot; is usually served cold with a light dipping sauce called &quot;tsuyu&quot;. South Korean &quot;somyeon&quot; may be eaten in hot or cold noodle soups. &quot;Sōmen&quot; is typically high in sodium.

Other names are &quot;nyūmen&quot; (煮麺) in Japanese, for a version served warm in soup, and the Chinese name &quot;guàmiàn&quot; (), which can be further classified into &quot;lóngxū&quot; () for the variant with long and thin strands and &quot;fèngwei&quot; () for the variant with flat and broad strands.

The earliest record for what would later be &quot;sōmen&quot; dates back to the Tang dynasty in 618-907 China. Around that time, the Japanese Imperial Court in Nara brought in some knotted pastry from China which they called Sakubei/索餅 (most likely Chinese Mahua/麻花). Sakubei would later evolve into Somen first in modern day Sakurai, Nara&#x27;s Miwa district during the Heian Period and would evolve to become high-class Japanese cuisine which would be served to emperors and nobles.

== East Asian cuisines ==
=== Japan ===
Sōmen are usually served cold with a light flavored dipping sauce or &quot;tsuyu&quot;. The tsuyu is usually a &quot;katsuobushi&quot;-based sauce that can be flavored with Japanese bunching onion, ginger, or &quot;myoga&quot;. In the summer, sōmen chilled with ice is a popular meal to help stay cool.

Sōmen served in hot soup is usually called &quot;nyūmen&quot; and eaten in the winter, just like soba or udon are.

Some restaurants offer &quot;nagashi-sōmen&quot; (流しそうめん flowing noodles) in the summer. The noodles are placed in a long flume of bamboo across the length of the restaurant. The flume carries clear, ice-cold water. As the sōmen pass by, diners pluck them out with their chopsticks and dip them in tsuyu. Catching the noodles requires a fair amount of dexterity, but the noodles that are not caught by the time they get to the end usually are not eaten, so diners are pressured to catch as much as they can. A few luxury establishments put their sōmen in real streams so that diners can enjoy their meal in a beautiful garden setting. Machines have been designed to simulate this experience at home.

=== Korea ===
In Korean cuisine, &quot;somyeon&quot; is used in hot and cold noodles soups such as &quot;janchi-guksu&quot; (banquet noodles) and &quot;kong-guksu&quot; (noodles in cold soybean soup), as well as soupless noodle dishes such as &quot;bibim-guksu&quot; (mixed noodles). It is often served with spicy &quot;anju&quot; (food that accompanies alcoholic drink) such as &quot;golbaengi-muchim&quot; (moon snail salad).

<text>Eurocentrism (also Eurocentricity or Western-centrism) refers to viewing the West as the center of world events or superior to all other cultures. The exact scope of Eurocentrism varies from the entire Western world to just the continent of Europe or even more narrowly, to Western Europe (especially during the Cold War). When the term is applied historically, it may be used in reference to the presentation of the European perspective on history as objective or absolute, or to an apologetic stance toward European colonialism and other forms of imperialism.

The term &quot;Eurocentrism&quot; dates back to the late 1970s but it did not become prevalent until the 1990s, when it was frequently applied in the context of decolonization and development and humanitarian aid that industrialised countries offered to developing countries. The term has since been used to critique Western narratives of progress, Western scholars who have downplayed and ignored non-Western contributions, and to contrast Western epistemologies with indigenous epistemologies.

== Terminology ==

The adjective &quot;Eurocentric&quot;, or &quot;Europe-centric&quot;, has been in use in various contexts since at least the 1920s. The term was popularised (in French as &quot;européocentrique&quot;) in the context of decolonization and internationalism in the mid-20th century. English usage of &quot;Eurocentric&quot; as an ideological term in identity politics was current by the mid-1980s.

The abstract noun &quot;Eurocentrism&quot; (French &quot;eurocentrisme&quot;, earlier &quot;europocentrisme&quot;) as the term for an ideology was coined in the 1970s by the Egyptian Marxian economist Samir Amin, then director of the African Institute for Economic Development and Planning of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa. Amin used the term in the context of a global, core–periphery or dependency model of capitalist development. English usage of &quot;Eurocentrism&quot; is recorded by 1979. According to Amin, Eurocentrism dates back to the Renaissance, and did not flourish until the 19th century.

The coinage of Western-centrism is younger, attested in the late 1990s, and specific to English.

==History==
According to historian Enrique Dussel, Eurocentrism has its roots in Hellenocentrism. Art historian and critic Christopher Allen points out that since antiquity, the outward-looking spirit of Western civilization has been more curious about other peoples and more open about learning about them than any other: Herodotus and Strabo travelled through Ancient Egypt and wrote about it in detail; Western explorers mapped the whole surface of the globe; Western scholars carried out fundamental research into all the languages of the world and established the sciences of archaeology and anthropology.

===European exceptionalism===
During the European colonial era, encyclopaedias often sought to give a rationale for the predominance of European rule during the colonial period by referring to a special position taken by Europe compared to the other continents.

Thus Johann Heinrich Zedler, in 1741, wrote that &quot;even though Europe is the smallest of the world&#x27;s four continents, it has for various reasons a position that places it before all others... Its inhabitants have excellent customs, they are courteous and erudite in both sciences and crafts&quot;.

The &quot;Brockhaus Enzyklopädie&quot; () of 1847 still expressed an ostensibly Eurocentric approach and claimed about Europe that &quot;its geographical situation and its cultural and political significance is clearly the most important of the five continents, over which it has gained a most influential government both in material and even more so in cultural aspects&quot;.

European exceptionalism thus grew out of the Great Divergence of the Early Modern period, due to the combined effects of the Scientific Revolution, the Commercial Revolution, and the rise of colonial empires, the Industrial Revolution and a Second European colonization wave.

The assumption of European exceptionalism is widely reflected in popular genres of literature, especially in literature for young adults (for example, Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1901 novel &quot;Kim&quot;) and in adventure-literature in general. Portrayal of European colonialism in such literature has been analysed in terms of Eurocentrism in retrospect, such as presenting idealised and often exaggeratedly masculine Western heroes, who conquered &quot;savage&quot; peoples in the remaining &quot;dark spaces&quot; of the globe.

The European miracle, a term coined by Eric Jones in 1981, refers to the surprising rise of Europe during the Early Modern period. During the 15th to 18th centuries, a great divergence took place, comprising the European Renaissance, the European Age of Discovery, the formation of European colonial empires, the Age of Reason, and the associated leap forward in technology and the development of capitalism and early industrialization. As a result, by the 19th century European powers dominated world trade and world politics.

In &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of History&quot;, published in 1837, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel saw world history as starting in Asia but shifting to Greece and Italy, and then north of the Alps to France, Germany and England. Hegel interpreted India and China as stationary countries, lacking inner momentum. Hegel&#x27;s China replaced the real historical development with a fixed, stable scenario, which made it the outsider of world history. Both India and China were waiting and anticipating a combination of certain factors from outside until they could acquire real progress in human civilization. Hegel&#x27;s ideas had a profound impact on western historiography and attitudes. Some scholars disagree with his ideas that the Oriental countries were outside of world history.

Max Weber (1864-1920) suggested that capitalism is the speciality of Europe, because Oriental countries such as India and China do not contain the factors which would enable them to develop capitalism in a sufficient manner. Weber wrote and published many treatises in which he emphasized the distinctiveness of Europe. In &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; (1905), he wrote that the &quot;rational&quot; capitalism, manifested by its enterprises and mechanisms, only appeared in the Protestant western countries, and a series of generalised and universal cultural phenomena only appear in the west.

Even the state, with a written constitution and a government organised by trained administrators and constrained by rational law, only appears in the West, even though other regimes can also comprise states. (&quot;Rationality&quot; is a multi-layered term whose connotations are developed and escalated as with the social progress. Weber regarded rationality as a proprietary article for western capitalist society.)

===Anticolonialism===
Even in the 19th century, anticolonial movements had developed claims about national traditions and values that were set against those of Europe in Africa and India. In some cases, as China, where local ideology was even more exclusionist than the Eurocentric one, Westernization did not overwhelm longstanding Chinese attitudes to its own cultural centrality.

Orientalism developed in the late 18th century as a disproportionate Western interest in and idealization of Eastern (i.e. Asian) cultures.

By the early 20th century, some historians, such as Arnold J. Toynbee, were attempting to construct multifocal models of world civilizations. Toynbee also drew attention in Europe to non-European historians, such as the medieval Tunisian scholar Ibn Khaldun. He also established links with Asian thinkers, such as through his dialogues with Daisaku Ikeda of Soka Gakkai International.

===Transformations of eurocentrism===
Authors show that since its first conceptualization, the concept of &quot;eurocentrism&quot; has evolved. Alina Sajed and John Hobson point to the emergence of a &quot;critical&quot; eurocentrism, stressing that &#x27;while [critical IR theory] is certainly critical of the West, nevertheless its tendency towards &quot;Eurofetishism&quot; –by which Western agency is reified at the expense of non-Western agency– leads it into a &quot;critical Eurocentrism&quot;. Expanding on their work, Audrey Alejandro has put forward the idea of a &quot;postcolonial&quot; eurocentrism, understood as an emerging form of Eurocentrism that

===Recent usage===
Arab journalists detected Eurocentrism in western media coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, when the depth and scope of coverage and concern contrasted with that devoted to longer-running contemporary wars outside Europe such as those in Syria and in Yemen.

==Debate and academic discourse==
Eurocentrism has been a particularly important concept in development studies. Brohman (1995) argued that Eurocentrism &quot;perpetuated intellectual dependence on a restricted group of prestigious Western academic institutions that determine the subject matter and methods of research&quot;.

In treatises on historical or contemporary Eurocentrism that appeared since the 1990s, Eurocentrism is mostly cast in terms of dualisms such as civilised/barbaric or advanced/backward, developed/undeveloped, core/periphery, implying &quot;evolutionary schemas through which societies inevitably progress&quot;, with a remnant of an &quot;underlying presumption of a superior white Western self as referent of analysis.&quot; Eurocentrism and the dualistic properties that it labels on non-European countries, cultures and persons have often been criticised in the political discourse of the 1990s and 2000s, particularly in the greater context of political correctness, race in the United States and affirmative action.

In the 1990s, there was a trend of criticising various geographic terms current in the English language as Eurocentric, such as the traditional division of Eurasia into Europe and Asia or the term Middle East.

Eric Sheppard, in 2005, argued that contemporary Marxism itself has Eurocentric traits (in spite of &quot;Eurocentrism&quot; originating in the vocabulary of Marxian economics), because it supposes that the third world must go through a stage of capitalism before &quot;progressive social formations can be envisioned&quot;.

Andre Gunder Frank harshly criticised Eurocentrism. He believed that most scholars were the disciples of the social sciences and history guided by Eurocentrism. He criticised some Western scholars for their ideas that non-Western areas lack outstanding contributions in history, economy, ideology, politics and culture compared with the West. These scholars believed that the same contribution made by the West gives Westerners an advantage of endo-genetic momentum which is pushed towards the rest of the world, but Frank believed that the Oriental countries also contributed to the human civilization in their own perspectives.

Arnold Toynbee in his &quot;A Study of History&quot;, gave a critical remark on Eurocentrism. He believed that although western capitalism shrouded the world and achieved a political unity based on its economy, the Western countries cannot &quot;westernize&quot; other countries. Toynbee concluded that Eurocentrism is characteristic of three misconceptions manifested by self-centerment, the fixed development of Oriental countries and linear progress.

There has been some debate on whether historical Eurocentrism qualifies as &quot;just another ethnocentrism&quot;, as it is found in most of the world&#x27;s cultures, especially in cultures with imperial aspirations, as in the Sinocentrism in China; in the Empire of Japan (c. 1868–1945), or during the American Century. James M. Blaut (2000) argued that Eurocentrism indeed went beyond other ethnocentrisms, as the scale of European colonial expansion was historically unprecedented and resulted in the formation of a &quot;colonizer&#x27;s model of the world&quot;.

Indigenous philosophies have been noted to greatly contrast with Eurocentric thought. Indigenous scholar James (Sákéj) Youngblood Henderson states that Eurocentricism contrasts greatly with Indigenous worldviews: &quot;the discord between Aboriginal and Eurocentric worldviews is dramatic. It is a conflict between natural and artificial contexts.&quot; Indigenous scholars Norman K. Denzin and Yvonna S. Linco state that &quot;in some ways, the epistemological critique initiated by Indigenous knowledge is more radical than other sociopolitical critiques of the West, for the Indigenous critique questions the very foundations of Western ways of knowing and being.&quot;

The terms Afrocentrism vs. Eurocentrism have come to play a role in the 2000s to 2010s in the context of the academic discourse on race in the United States and critical whiteness studies, aiming to expose white supremacism and white privilege. Afrocentrist scholars, such as Molefi Kete Asante, have argued that there is a prevalence of Eurocentric thought in the processing of much of academia on African affairs. Similarly, the Asiacentric scholar, Yoshitaka Miike, has critiqued theoretical, methodological, and comparative Eurocentrism in knowledge production about Asian societies and cultures.

In contrast, in an article, &#x27;Eurocentrism and Academic Imperialism&#x27; by Professor Seyed Mohammad Marandi, from the University of Tehran, states that Eurocentric thought exists in almost all aspects of academia in many parts of the world, especially in the humanities. Edgar Alfred Bowring states that in the West, self-regard, self-congratulation and denigration of the &#x27;Other&#x27; run more deeply and those tendencies have infected more aspects of their thinking, laws and policy than anywhere else. Luke Clossey and Nicholas Guyatt have measured the degree of Eurocentrism in the research programs of top history departments.

Some authors have focused on how scholars who denounce Eurocentrism often inadvertently reproduce Eurocentrism through culturally bias norm&#x27;s. The methodologist Audrey Alejandro refers to this process as a &quot;recursive paradox&quot;: &quot;It is a methodo-epistemological recursive paradox that [International Relations] critical scholars experience, producing a discourse that is implicitly counter-productive to the anti-Eurocentric values they advocate.&quot;

==Africa==
===Colonial historiography===

Most African societies used oral tradition to record their history, meaning there was little written history. Colonial histories focussed on the exploits of soldiers, colonial administrators, and &quot;colonial figures&quot;, using limited sources and written from an entirely European perspective, ignoring the viewpoint of the colonised under the pretence of white supremacism. Africans were considered racially inferior, supporting their &quot;civilising mission&quot;. The most widespread genre of colonial narrative involved the Hamitic hypothesis, which claimed the inherent superiority of light-skinned people over dark-skinned people. Only Hamitic Africans were considered &quot;civilisation&quot;, and by extension all major advances and innovations in Africa were thought to derive from them. Oral sources were deprecated and dismissed by most historians, giving them the impression Africa had no history and little desire to create it. Some colonisers took interest in the other viewpoint and attempted to produce a more detailed history of Africa using oral sources and archaeology, however they received little recognition at the time. 

African historiography became organised at the academic level in the mid 20th century. Despite a movement towards utilising oral sources in a multidisciplinary approach and their growing legitimacy in historiography, contemporary historians are still tasked with decolonising African historiography, building the institutional frameworks incorporating African epistemologies, and representing an African perspective.

== Latin America==
Eurocentrism affected Latin America through colonial domination and expansion. This occurred through the application of new criteria meant to &quot;impose a new social classification of the world population on a global scale&quot;. Based on this occurrence, a new social-historic identities were newly produced, although already produced in America. Some of these names include; &#x27;Whites&#x27;, &#x27;Negroes&#x27;, &#x27;Blacks&#x27;, &#x27;Yellows&#x27;, &#x27;Olives&#x27;, &#x27;Indians&#x27;, and &#x27;Mestizos&#x27;. With the advantage of being located in the Atlantic basin, &#x27;Whites&#x27; were in a privileged to control gold and silver production. The work which created the product was by &#x27;Indians&#x27; and &#x27;Negroes&#x27;. With the control of commercial capital from &#x27;White&#x27; workers. And therefore, Europe or Western Europe emerged as the central place of new patterns and capitalist power.

== Islamic world ==
Eurocentrism&#x27;s effect on the Islamic world has predominantly come from a fundamental statement of preventing the account of lower-level explanation and account of Islamic cultures and their social evolution, mainly through eurocentrism&#x27;s idealist construct. This construct has gained power from the historians revolving their conclusions around the idea of a central point that favours the notion that the evolution of societies and their progress are dictated by general tendencies, leading to the Islamic world&#x27;s evolution becoming more of a philosophical topic of history instead of historical fact. Along with this, eurocentrism extends to trivialise and marginalise the philosophies, scientific contributions, cultures, and other additional facets of the Islamic world.

Stemming from Eurocentrism&#x27;s innate bias towards Western civilization came the creation of the concept of the &quot;European Society,&quot; which favoured the components (mainly Christianity) of European civilization and allowed eurocentrists to brand diverging societies and cultures as &quot;uncivilized&quot;. Prevalent during the nineteenth century, the labelling of uncivilised in the eyes of eurocentrists enabled Western countries to classify non-European and non-white countries as inferior, and limit their inclusion and contribution in actions like international law. This exclusion was seen as acceptable by individuals like John Westlake, a professor of international law at the University of Cambridge at the time, who commented that countries with European civilizations should be those which comprise the international society, and that countries like Turkey and Persia should only be allowed a part of international law.

=== Orientalism ===
Eurocentrism&#x27;s reach has not only affected the perception of the cultures and civilizations of the Islamic world, but also the aspects and ideas of Orientalism, a cultural idea that distinguished the &quot;Orient&quot; of the East from the &quot;Occidental&quot; Western societies of Europe and North America, and which was originally created so that the social and cultural milestones of the Islamic and Oriental world would be recognised. This effect began to take place during the nineteenth century when the Orientalist ideals were distilled and shifted from topics of sensuality and deviating mentalities to what is described by Edward Said as &quot;unchallenged coherence&quot;. Along with this shift came the creation of two types of orientalism: latent, which covered the Orient&#x27;s constant durability through history, and manifest, a more dynamic orientalism that changes with the new discovery of information. The eurocentric influence is shown in the latter, as the nature of manifest Orientalism is to be altered with new findings, which leaves it vulnerable to the warping of its refiner&#x27;s ideals and principles. In this state, eurocentrism has used orientalism to portray the Orient as &quot;backwards&quot; and bolster the superiority of the Western world and continue the undermining of their cultures to further the agenda of racial inequality.

With those wanting to represent the eurocentric ideals better by way of orientalism, there came a barrier of languages, being Arabic, Persian, and other similar languages. With more researchers wanting to study more of Orientalism, there was an assumption made about the languages of the Islamic world: that having the ability to transcribe the texts of the past Islamic world would give great knowledge and insight on oriental studies. In order to do this, many researchers underwent training in philology, believing that an understanding of the languages would be the only necessary training. This reasoning came as the belief at the time was that other studies like anthropology and sociology were deemed irrelevant as they did not believe it misleading to this portion of mankind.

== Beauty standards and the cosmetic industry==
Due to colonialism, Eurocentric beauty ideals have had varying degrees of impact on the cultures of non-Western countries. The influence on beauty ideals across the globe varies by region, with Eurocentric ideals having a relatively strong impact in South Asia but little to no impact in East Asia. However, Eurocentric beauty ideals have also been on the decline in the United States, especially with the success of Asian female models, which may be signaling a breakdown in the hegemony of White American beauty ideals. In Vietnam, Eurocentric beauty ideals have been openly rejected, as local women consider Western women&#x27;s ideal of beauty as being overweight, masculine and unattractive.

Another study questioning the impact of Eurocentric beauty ideals in South Asia noted that Indian women won a relatively high number of international beauty pageants, and that Indian media tends to use mostly Indian female models. The authors cite the dominance of the Bollywood film industry in India, which tends to minimize the impact of Western ideals.

=== Clark doll experiment ===

In the 1940s, psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark conducted experiments called &quot;the doll tests&quot; to examine the psychological effects of segregation on African-American children. They tested children by presenting them with four dolls, identical in all but skin tone. The children were instructed to choose which doll they preferred and were asked the race of the doll. Most of the children chose the white doll. The Clarks stated in their results that the perceptions of the African-American children had been altered by the discrimination they faced. The tested children also labelled the white dolls with positive descriptions.

=== Mexican doll experiment ===
In 2012, Mexicans recreated the doll test. Mexico&#x27;s National Council to Prevent Discrimination presented a video where children had to pick the &quot;good doll&quot;, and the doll that looks like them. By doing this experiment, the researchers sought to analyse the degree to which Mexican children are influenced by modern-day media accessible to them. Most of the children chose the white doll; they also stated that it looked like them. The people who carried out the study noted that Eurocentrism is deeply rooted in different cultures, including Latin cultures.

=== Skin lightening ===
Skin lightening has become a common practice in some countries. A 2011 study found that, in Tanzania, motivation for the use of skin lightening products is to look more &#x27;European&#x27;. However, in East Asia, the practice began long before exposure to Europeans – tan skin was associated with lower-class field work, and thus constant exposure to sun, while having pale skin signified belonging to the upper-class. Skin bleaching can have negative health effects. One study observed that, among the female population of Senegal in West Africa, 26% of women were using skin lightening creams at the time. The most common products used were hydroquinone and corticosteroids. 75% of women who used these creams showed adverse cutaneous effects, mainly acne.

===East Asia===
In East Asia, the impact of Eurocentrism in beauty advertisements has been minimal. Anti-European undercurrents in local advertisements for female-oriented products are quite common. European models are hired for around half of advertisements made by European brands such as Estée Lauder and L&#x27;Oréal, while local Japanese cosmetics brands tend to use exclusively East Asian female models.

In Singapore, a country with a large population of Chinese people. European women are ranked below Chinese women in the female beauty hierarchy. According to the author, the blonde hair of Swedish women reduced their femininity, because it was racialized as a Western trait. The authors also noted that these women&#x27;s Swedish husbands were highly attracted to local East Asian women, which further reduced the self-esteem of the blonde Swedish women living in Singapore.

The use of European female models has actually declined within Japan, and some Japanese skincare companies have discontinued the use of Western female models entirely, while others have even portrayed white women as explicitly inferior to Asian women, on the basis of their lighter hair color. There is a widespread belief in Japan that Japanese women&#x27;s skin color is &quot;better&quot; than white women&#x27;s, and the placement of European female models in local advertisements does not reflect any special status of white women within Japan.

=== Brazil ===
The beauty ideal for females in Brazil is the ; a mixed-race brown woman who is supposed to represent the best characteristics of every racial group in Brazil. According to Alexander Edmond&#x27;s book &quot;Pretty Modern: Beauty, Sex, and Plastic Surgery in Brazil&quot;, whiteness plays a role in Latin American, specifically Brazilian, beauty standards, but it is not necessarily distinguished based on skin colour. Edmonds said the main ways to define whiteness in people in Brazil is by looking at their hair, nose, then mouth before considering skin colour. Edmonds focuses on the popularity of plastic surgery in Brazilian culture. Plastic surgeons usually applaud and flatter mixtures when emulating aesthetics for performing surgery, and the more popular mixture is African and European. This shapes beauty standards by racialising biological and popular beauty ideals to suggest that mixture with whiteness is better. Donna Goldstein&#x27;s book &quot;Laughter Out of Place: Race, Class, Violence, and Sexuality in a Rio Shantytown&quot; also addresses how whiteness influences beauty in Brazil. Goldstein notes that in Brazil, there is a hierarchy for beauty that places being mixed race at the top and pure, un-admixed black characteristics at the bottom, calling them ugly.

In Erica Lorraine William&#x27;s &quot;Sex Tourism in Bahia: Ambiguous Entanglements&quot;, Williams notes that there is no Eurocentric beauty ideal for women in Brazil. White Brazilian women are aware that foreign male sex tourists are not interested in them, and that they prefer brown and black women over white Brazilian women. One white woman in Brazil complained that she is not noticed by &quot;gringos&quot; and that they prefer black and Mestiza women for sexual liaisons.

<doc id="179389" wikidata="Q39026" url="?curid=179389" title="Rhodesian Ridgeback">
<text>The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a large dog breed originally bred in Southern Africa. The original breed standard was drafted by F.R. Barnes, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), in 1922, and approved by the South African Kennel Union in 1927. Its forebears can be traced to the ridged hunting and guardian dogs of the Khoikhoi. These were interbred with European dogs by the early colonists of the Cape Colony for assisting in the hunting of lions. Rhodesian Ridgebacks are known for their protective, yet loyal temperaments.

== History ==

The Khoikhoi people who lived the Cape Peninsula when the Dutch began trading with the area during the mid 17th century, had a hunting dog which was described by Europeans as absolutely fearless and ferocious when acting as a guard dog. This dog measured approximately at the withers, with a lean but muscular frame. The ears have been described both as erect but later described as hanging due to interbreeding with European dogs, but the most distinctive feature was the length of hair often growing in the reverse direction along its back. Within 53 years of the first Dutch settlements in Southern Africa, the Europeans were using these local dogs themselves.

By the early 1800s, European colonists had also imported a variety of mainly European dog breeds to this area of Africa, including such dedicated hunting dogs as Greyhounds, Mastiffs, Great Danes and Bloodhounds. The Dogo Cubano (Cuban Bloodhound), an extinct breed used for dogfighting and guarding, was highly emphasized in the composition of the early Rhodesian Ridgeback. Genetic analysis indicates that the Rhodesian Ridgeback and the Great Dane fall within the same genetic clade (group), which implies the Dane&#x27;s major contribution. These breeds were bred with the indigenous African dogs, including the dog of the Khoikhoi people, which resulted in the Boer hunting dogs, generically called names such as &quot;boerhond&quot; (Boer hound) in Dutch; then its descendant language of Afrikaans, which are the chief forerunners to the modern Rhodesian Ridgeback. The sequencing of ancient dog genomes indicates that the southern African Rhodesian Ridgeback retains 4% pre-colonial ancestry.

Daniel Helm of the London Missionary Society, was born in the Cape Colony, joined the London Missionary Society himself, and moved from the Zuurbraak (now Suurbraak) mission station just east of Swellendam (modern Western Cape Province, South Africa) to the Hope Fountain Mission in Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia, travelling from October 1874 to December 1875, then bringing two ridged dog bitches from somewhere between Kimberley (modern Northern Cape Province, South Africa) and Swellendam with him to Hope Fountain in 1879 en route to becoming, as it would turn out, a political advisor to King Lobengula, house-host to hunter-explorer Frederick Courteney Selous, postmaster of Bulawayo and well-appreciated tooth-extractor. At Hope Fountain, now part of the city of Bulawayo, fellow South African transplant Cornelius van Rooyen (b. 1860, Uitenhage, modern Eastern Cape Province, South Africa), a big–game hunter, was married to Maria Vermaak of Bloemhof by Charles Helm in 1879 the same year Helm brought his two rough-coated grey-black bitches to the Mission. Van Rooyen saw Helm&#x27;s pair of bitches and decided to breed his own dogs with them to incorporate their guarding abilities.

After initially greyer, rough-coated litters originating from Helm&#x27;s dogs, van Rooyen&#x27;s subsequently crossed offspring turned to redder coats, incorporating the Khoikhoi landrace dog&#x27;s ridges already carried in Boer dogs within his genomes. They became the foundation stock of a kennel which developed dogs over the next 35 years with the ability to bay a lion, to not attack it outright but to harass it by darting in and out with quick snaps and confusing the animal until the hunter shot it. These dogs were used to hunt lions, boars and other big game as well as to clear farmlands of wild pigs and baboons, and they can kill a baboon independently of a human hunter&#x27;s collaboration.

The original breed standard was drafted in 1922 by F. R. Barnes on founding the first Rhodesian Ridgeback Club at a Bulawayo Kennel Club show, then in Southern Rhodesia (now in Zimbabwe), and based on that of the Dalmatian. In 1927, Barnes&#x27; standard was approved by the South African Kennel Union. Outside the subcontinent and internationally, the first Rhodesian Ridgebacks in Britain were shown by Mrs. Edward Foljambe in 1928. In 1950, Mr. and Mrs. William H. O&#x27;Brien of Arizona brought six carefully selected Rhodesian Ridgebacks to the US from South Africa. He and his wife and Margaret Lowthian of California began the process of getting the breed accepted by the American Kennel Club. Similarly, in 1952, The Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of Great Britain was founded at Crufts to promote the breed around the United Kingdom to show judges, so a standard for the breed might be recognised. In 1954 the first Challenge Certificates were awarded to dogs shown as Rhodesian Ridgebacks at United Kingdom competitions, toward their subsequent recognition by The Kennel Club of Great Britain, and in 1955 the American Kennel Club recognised the Rhodesian Ridgeback breed as a member of the hound group.

===Culling of puppies===
Traditionally, many Rhodesian Ridgeback puppies were culled at birth for numerous reasons, including ridgelessness. Some breed parent clubs and canine registries in Europe have even made the culling of ridgeless whelps a requirement. Contemporary breeders are increasingly opting for surgical sterilisation of these offspring to ensure they will not be bred but can live into maturity as non-showing, non-breeding pets. It was pointed out on the BBC One investigative documentary &quot;Pedigree Dogs Exposed&quot; that the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of Great Britain&#x27;s &quot;code of ethics&quot;, which is ratified annually by the kennel club, states that &quot;Ridgeless puppies shall be culled&quot;, and that &quot;mismarked&quot; puppies will only ever be sold on condition that they are never shown, and are neutered. The Rhodesian Ridgeback Club defended itself pointing to the statement that follows, &quot;if a breeder finds this morally impossible [to cull the puppy] the puppy shall be homed...&quot; as indication that culling is not mandatory, but preferred. It was only after the publicity surrounding the promotion of culling that they reversed their code of ethics to say &quot;no healthy puppy will be culled&quot;.

==Description==

===Appearance===
The appearance standard of the Rhodesian Ridgeback originated in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and goes back to the year 1922, and by 2019 this standard had remained virtually unchanged. The Rhodesian Ridgeback&#x27;s distinguishing feature is the ridge of hair running along its back in the opposite direction from the rest of its coat. It consists of a fan-like area formed by two whorls of hair (called &quot;crowns&quot;) and tapers from immediately behind the shoulders down to the level of the hips. The ridge is usually about in width at its widest point. It is believed to originate from the dog used by the original African dog population which had a similar ridge.

Male Rhodesian Ridgebacks usually stand at the withers and weigh about (FCI standard); females are typically tall and about in weight. Rhodesian Ridgebacks are typically very muscular and have a light wheaten to red wheaten coat, which should be short, dense, sleek and glossy in appearance, and neither woolly nor silky.

White is acceptable on the chest and toes, but excessive white is considered a fault. The presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the AKC standard, although the elaboration of the AKC standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive. The FCI standard states that excessive black hairs throughout the coat are highly undesirable. Rhodesian Ridgebacks sometimes have a dark mask, but it is not considered a fault to have no mask at all. The dog&#x27;s nose should be black or liver in keeping with the colour of the dog. No other coloured nose is permissible. The brown nose is a recessive gene. It is not as common as a black nose; some breeders believe the inclusion of brown noses in a breeding program is necessary for maintaining the vibrancy of the coat. The eyes should be round and should reflect the dog&#x27;s colour: dark eyes with a black nose, amber eyes with a brown (liver) nose.

Other dog breeds also have a reverse line of fur along the spine, including the Phu Quoc ridgeback dog and Thai Ridgeback. The Thai Ridgeback is a crossbreed of the Phu Quoc; historians have speculated the relationship between the Rhodesian Ridgeback and the Phu Quoc with suggestions that historically one breed may have been imported to the other&#x27;s location.

=== Temperament ===
Rhodesian Ridgebacks are known to be loyal and intelligent. They are typically somewhat aloof to strangers; this is not to be confused with aggression, a Rhodesian Ridgeback with a good temperament will not attack a stranger for no reason. They require consistent training and correct socialization; therefore they are often not the best choice for inexperienced dog owners and families with younger children.

Despite Rhodesian Ridgebacks being extremely athletic and sometimes imposing, they do have a sensitive side. Francis R. Barnes, who wrote the first standard in 1922, acknowledged that, &quot;rough treatment ... should never be administered to these dogs, especially when they are young. They go to pieces with handling of that kind.&quot; The Rhodesian Ridgeback accepts correction as long as it is fair and justified, and as long as it comes from someone the dog knows and trusts.

==Genetics of the ridge==

The genotype responsible for the ridge was found by a consortium of researchers at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (Nicolette Salmon Hillbertz, Göran Andersson, et al.), Uppsala University (Leif Andersson, Mats Nilsson, et al.) and the Broad Institute (Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, et al.) in 2007.

The only disqualification in the AKC standard for this breed is &quot;ridgelessness&quot;. This term refers to the purebred offspring of heterozygous parental animals that do not inherit a copy of the ridge mutation from either parent and thus lack the classic ridged back. The most current research suggests that the ridge mutation is autosomal dominant with near-complete penetrance: 95% of heterozygous dogs have a ridged back. Well under 25% of puppies lack a ridge, indicating a significant proportion of the breed are homozygous for the mutation.

The genetic test which distinguishes dominant homozygotes (R/R - two ridge genes) from heterozygotes (R/r - one ridge gene) is available (www.genocan.eu/en). Using the genetic test, a breeder may accurately predict birth of ridgeless puppies.



== Health ==
Health conditions that are known to affect the Rhodesian Ridgeback breed are hip dysplasia and dermoid sinus. The Rhodesian Ridgeback ranks number six in terms of most affected breeds for thyroid problems recorded by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals. A UK study found the average life expectancy to be 12 years.

===Dermoid sinus===
Dermoid sinus is a congenital neural-tube defect that is known to affect this breed. The dermoid is often likened to a thin &quot;spaghetti strand&quot; beneath the skin. Puppies should always be screened at birth by the breeder and veterinarian, and the examination repeated as the puppies grow before they go to their new homes. This is done by palpation of the subcutaneous dorsal midline from the base of the skull to the insertion of the tail. Surgical removal is an option for affected neonates, puppies and adult dogs. All affected dogs, even those surgically corrected, should be spayed or neutered and never be bred, since surgical dermoid sinus removal can be extremely cost prohibitive, and because many unremoved dermoid sinuses will eventually abscess. Abscessed dermoid sinuses will be at best a recurrent, painful problem, and if the sinus communicates with the tissues around the spinal cord, cause meningitis and often death. However, it has been shown that supplementation of folic acid to the diet of the brood bitch before mating and during pregnancy reduces the incidence of dermoid sinus. One study on the Swedish population estimates that 8-10% are affected. Slightly less than 5% of Rhodesian Ridgebacks were reported to be affected with the condition in a US breed club survey.

===Degenerative myelopathy===
The Rhodesian Ridgeback is one of the breeds more commonly affected by degenerative myelopathy. The condition is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the SOD1 gene.

===Hypothyroidism===
Hypothyroidism is a growing problem in the Rhodesian Ridgeback, and this condition causes a multitude of symptoms, including weight gain and hair loss. Treatment for hypothyroidism in dogs consists of an inexpensive once-daily oral medication. Dr. Lorna Kennedy at the University of Manchester&#x27;s Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in England has found the haplotype (group of genes), which, when present, double the chances of a Rhodesian Ridgeback becoming hypothyroid due to lymphocytic thyroiditis. This is important to the breed because lymphocytic thyroiditis is the overwhelming cause of hypothyroidism in Rhodesian Ridgebacks.

===Gastric dilatation volvulus===
Like many other deep-chested breeds, the Rhodesian Ridgeback is prone to gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly known as bloat. This is a potentially fatal condition that requires immediate treatment.

===Resources===
RRCUS H&amp;G - the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of the United States maintains a web site devoted to the breed&#x27;s health issues that also gathers ongoing research for their Health &amp; Genetics Committee. This group recommends that breeders perform at least four health screenings: hips, elbows, thyroid and eyes, with cardiac and hearing tests optional.

CRRHS - it is also recommended that all ridgeback owners enter their dogs&#x27; information in the Comprehensive Rhodesian Ridgeback Health Survey.

<text>Holmenkollbakken is a large ski jumping hill located at Holmenkollen in Oslo, Norway. It has a hill size of HS134, a construction point of K-120, and a capacity for 70,000 spectators. Holmenkollen has hosted the Holmenkollen Ski Festival since 1892, which since 1980 have been part of the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and 1983 the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup. It has also hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1930, 1966, 1982 and 2011.

The hill has been rebuilt 19 times; important upgrades include a stone take-off in 1910, an in-run superstructure in 1914, and a new superstructure in 1928. During the Second World War, the venue was used as a military installation, but upgraded in the late 1940s. Further expansions were made ahead of the 1966 and 1982 World Championships, as well as in 1991. Between 2008 and 2010, the entire structure was demolished and rebuilt. The hill record is held by Robert Johansson at 144.0 meters. The hill is part of Holmenkollen National Arena, which in addition to cross-country and biathlon venues has the normal hill Midtstubakken.

==History==

===Original hill===

The first major skiing competition in Oslo was Husebyrennet, which was held in Husebybakken in Ullern from 1879 until 1891. In 1887, the road to Holmenkollen was opened, although it was at the time only used for recreation, as there was no housing in the area. I. C. L. Holm saw the potential to develop the area into a recreational centre, and established Peisestuen in 1886, Holmenkollen Sportsstue in 1891, Holmenkollen Sanatorium og Turisthotell in 1894, and Voksenkollen Sanatorium in 1900. In 1890, Husebyrennet had to be canceled due to lack of snow, and instead the tournament was held at Ullbakken at Frognerseteren. Because of the distance, the tournament was held on a Sunday; this caused some criticism, and to compensate it was decided not to collect entrance fees. The following year, the final event was held in Husebybakken.

Following the 1891 season, the lease with the land owner for Husebybakken needed to be renegotiated. Several times the venues had had too little snow and Fritz Huitfeldt and Hans Krag proposed building a new hill at Besserudmyra. After half a year of planning, the general assembly of the Association for the Promotion of Skiing approved the move in late 1891. To create sufficient water supply for the hotels, a dam had been built and this created Besserudtjernet, a small lake, at the bottom of the hill. It would cover with ice during the winter. Construction was simple: a few trees had to be chopped down and when the snow came, branches were laid where the jump was to be. The first competition was held on 30 January 1892, and was spectated by between fifteen and twenty thousand people, who saw jumpers reach 15 to 21.5 meters.
The original hill had a knoll just after the take-off, which gave the psychological feeling of falling and made landing more difficult. It was therefore decided to change the profile slightly to make the hill safer and allow more jumpers to land properly. No standard profiles existed at the time, so the Association for the Promotion of Skiing had to do guesswork to create a better profile. The new profile was taken into use from 1894 and had cost NOK 2000. For the first decade, the take-off was rebuilt for every year, and its position would therefore vary. In 1904, the take-off was rebuilt with rocks, giving it a specific location on the hill. Prior to the 1907 season, landing slope was built down slightly into the terrain down from the 25 meter mark, as it would give easier landing. The take-off was moved in 1910 and built as a tall stone structure. To keep the lake with a hard layer of ice, the snow was removed as it fell; if the ice was not thick enough it could create problems with flooding the spectator areas during the events. From 1913, the lake was opened as a skating rink and marketed by the hotels as part of their services. However, it was never a success, and was abandoned within a few years.

During the 1910s it had become common in the United States to build jumps with a scaffold superstructure for the in-run, and this had been described as an abomination in the Norwegian press. Prior to the 1914 season, a tall steel superstructure was built. This resulted in massive negative reactions in the press, and it was the public&#x27;s opinion that ski jumping was to be done in natural hills. The same year, two other major Norwegian hills received similar structures, Nydalsbakken and Solbergbakken. The first trials were made on 15 January, giving jumps 34 meters. This was regarded as the furthest anyone would jump. The hill was subsequently expanded slightly a few times afterwards, including blasting it steeper, chopping it wider, and covering the landing slope with earth and sowing grass to improve the profile.

===Olympic hill===
The day after the race in 1927, the superstructure collapsed, caused by rot in combination with a heavy snowfall. This caused the introduction of public control with scaffolding and bleachers in Norway. By then, Holmenkollbakken was lagging behind internationally, and the world record at the time had exceeded 60 meters. It was therefore decided that a new superstructure would be tall and moved further back. Besserudtjernet was partially drained in 1928, but the hotels, which received their water from the lake, would not allow draining the following years. In 1931, the lake was fully drained, which allowed the out-run to be longer. In the 1930s, talk of an 80-meter hill started, which would potentially be built in Rødkleiva, further out in Nordmarka. The Association for the Promotion of Skiing made a formal investigation into the matter in 1937. There was agreement that the venue was becoming too small for international competitions.

Following the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1940 being awarded to Oslo, the Association for the Promotion of Skiing decided to build a larger in-run. Construction started in 1938 and consisted of a tall in-run tower. The take-off was moved further back and higher. The new structure was inaugurated in 1940, although the World Championships were canceled due to the Second World War. The venue was subsequently left unused for five years during the German occupation of Norway. German forces used the hill as a site for anti-aircraft artillery and the in-run was painted green. In 1945, the venue received a new upgrade, this time with new grandstands and a larger profile.
In 1948, Oslo was awarded to host the 1952 Winter Olympics. This caused a bonanza of plans, one superseding the other. Until then, the grandstand on the sides of the hill had been temporary; prior to the Olympics these were rebuilt as permanent. A new grandstand was built, a jury tower was constructed, as was facilities for the delegates, the royal family and radio broadcasting. The in-run was rebuilt; while it previously had been a mess of open, wooden structures, it was shelled in, painted white and received an elevator. The hill had to be expanded, and to allow this, the landing slope needed to be lifted by being built as an artificial structure. Below the lifted part of the hill was built a three-story building, with the ski museum in the lower two floors and a restaurant in the top floor. The lake was dug deep and made a swimming pool during the summer. The upgrades cost NOK 1.5 million, paid for by Oslo Municipality. These upgrades resulted in an artificial lake being constructed in the off-run, which became a recreational and swimming venue for the city&#x27;s residents. The lake was at the time deep and had a typical temperature of . Oslo had a failed bid for the 1968 Winter Olympics.

Following Oslo&#x27;s decision to bid for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1966, it became evident that more upgrades would be needed to meet the International Ski Federation&#x27;s requirements. To allow for longer jumps, the take-off needed to be moved back, and the lake dug deeper, with new concrete stands being built into the sides. Combined with the tower being built taller, this gave a height difference between the start and the off-run, allowing for the desired lengths. The championships were the first to use computer to calculate the scores, but communication still used wired telephones, as had been used during the Olympics. The public announcement and scoreboard systems remained manual.
By 1971, the Association for the Promotion of Skiing was no longer making much money off the Ski Festival, and they started discussing rebuilding the entire complex. Rolf Ramm Østgaard made a proposal which would include a twin hill, with both a normal and large hill. Again the proposal of building the large hill at Rødkleiva was launched. The arguments for keeping the hill at Holmenkollen was that it would allow for a close connection between the ski jumping and cross-country skiing events. However, Holmenkollen, because it was built with a superstructure, was plagued with wind. Experience from among other things Salpausselkä in Lahti, Finland, showed that this could be partially combated by building the jump into the hill. No immediate solution was found, and maintenance of the old structure continued. Lighting which allowed the venue to be seen from the city during night was installed in 1977. The main problem was the elevator, which was eventually replaced in 1978. During the 1970s, a stage was built in the lake, which allowed concerts, plays and other entertainment events to take place. Oslo City Council considered bidding for the 1980 Winter Olympics during the 1970s, but it was found that it would not be a suitable investment.

In 1979, Oslo was awarded the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1982, and further upgrades to the hill were necessary. The costs of the upgrades were NOK 50 million, of which the Norwegian Ski Federation paid NOK 5 million, and Oslo Municipality and the state split the rest. The large expenditures resulted in a public debate. The upgrades saw the introduction of electronics into most parts of the venue. The old system of manual distance measurement by people standing beside the hill was abolished, and replaced by the video-based system Robotron. Other new installations was an electronic result and scoreboard system, a new time-keeping and speed system, and a new central system to calculate scores. The in-run was expanded, and a mobile start platform was installed, but later removed and replaced by a bar. The knoll and landing slope were adjusted, and the straight section was moved further down. In the transition to the out-run, of earthwork was blasted away, and Besserudtjernet was sunk another . This allowed for additional grandstands to be built and the last wooden grandstands were removed. New structures were built for delegates, broadcasting and the jury.
The Robotron system was found to be unreliable, and was taken out of use in 1986. In 1990, a porcelain track was laid in the in-run. An aluminum stage was also built across the off-run, which could be used for concerts during the summer. In 1992, the hill was further expanded by digging down another . This increased the K-point from 105 to 110. From 1992, the venue used a system of video still images to determine the length. Following the decision to upgrade the hill in 1991, Kollenhopp was established. A cooperation between the ski jumping clubs in Eastern Norway, it was to create more jumping activity in Holmenkollbakken, similar to the success of Trønderhopp. From 1992, the hill received floodlighting, allowing events to be scheduled into the evening, and the organizers able to move events to the evening, if wind conditions were not good during the day.

===New hill===
In 2002, the Association for the Promotion of Skiing and the city started the process of applying for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2009. The city council decided to grant NOK 52.8 million to upgrade Holmenkollen, including Holmenkollbakken, for the 2009 World Championships. Oslo lost the vote in the International Ski Federation (FIS) against Liberec, Czech Republic, on 4 June 2004. The Norwegian Ski Federation subsequently stated that they would apply for the 2011 World Championships. The Association for the Promotion of Skiing stated that they wanted a new hill in Rødkleiva instead of expanding the existing ski flying hill in Vikersund, Vikersundbakken. Holmenkollbakken would then be used for the last time as a large hill during the 2011 World Championships, and would then converted to a normal hill. In May 2005, the general assembly of the Norwegian Ski Federation voted to build a new ski flying and normal hill in Rødkleiva ahead of the 2011 World Championships. Following Vikersundbakken being awarded the FIS Ski-Flying World Championships 2012 in 2008, the general assembly of the Norwegian Ski Federation that year decided to terminate the plans for a ski flying hill in Rødkleiva.

On 22 September 2005, FIS stated that an all-new Holmenkollbakken would have to be built if Oslo was to host the World Championships and World Cup tournaments. FIS stated that similar reconstructions had been done with Schattenbergschanze in Oberstdorf, Germany, and Bergiselschanze in Innsbruck, Austria. In December 2005, the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage gave permission for the tower to be demolished, on the condition it was replaced by a new in-run with a similar architectural quality and retain its function as a landmark. They stated that it was the activity itself that is worthy of preservation, not the structure itself. The city council made the final decision to apply for the World Championships and build a new hill on 1 March 2006. A new hill was at the time estimated to cost NOK 310 million, and the state was willing to finance NOK 70 million of those. Oslo was awarded the 2011 World Championships in May 2006.
The municipality issued an architectural design competition to rebuild the hill; Julien De Smedt and Florian Kosche&#x27;s proposal was selected among 104 entrants. At the time, it was estimated that the new national arena would cost NOK 653 million. Demolition of Holmenkollbakken started on 16 October 2008. The World Cup tournament in 2009 was held at Vikersundbakken instead of Holmenkollen because of the reconstruction. By 2008, the cost had accelerated to NOK 1.2 billion, and by the following year it had reached NOK 1.8 billion. City Commissioner For Business and Culture, Anette Wiig Bryn of the Progress Party, had to leave her position because of the cost overruns. A consultant report ordered by the municipality concluded that the pressure to find cost savings to stay within the budget, which was underestimated to start with, resulted in slower progress, which again resulted in higher costs.

The costs of the new large hill were NOK 715 million, while total costs for the upgrade of the national arena and infrastructure ended at NOK 2,426 million. This included the construction of a new ski stadium next to Holmenkollbakken, and Midtstubakken, and upgrades to the Holmenkollen Line. It was originally decided that the first jump would be taken by Anette Sagen, Norway&#x27;s leading female jumper, on 3 March 2010. However, the organizers decided that Bjørn Einar Romøren would be allowed to test-jump the venue the evening before. In the first ever jump in the new venue, Romøren jumped 110.0 meters. The organizers stated that Sagen&#x27;s jump the following day, which reached 106.5 meters, was to be considered the official first jump. Romøren was subsequently suspended from the following World Cup round.

On 1 January, 2018, Holmenkollen hosted alpine skiing for the first time when World Cup parallel slalom events for men and women were held under the lights on a temporary course constructed inside the ski jumping arena, replacing a similar event previously held in Munich. The races returned the next season, also on New Year&#x27;s Day.

==Facilities==
The hill is part of Holmenkollen National Arena, which also consists of a combined cross-country skiing and biathlon stadium, the normal hill Midtstubakken. Along with Granåsen in Trondheim and Lysgårdsbakken in Lillehammer, Holmenkollen is one of three normal and large hill national arenas for ski jumping and Nordic skiing. The hill is the most popular tourist attraction in Norway, and has roughly one million visitors each year. Holmenkollbakken is co-located with Holmenkollen Ski Museum, which presents the history of skiing. It has a simulator which allows the public to visualize a ski jump in the hill. The hill record is , set by Anders Jacobsen in 2011, and the women&#x27;s record is set by Anette Sagen in 2006.

After the 1992 upgrades, the Olympic hill had a K-spot of and the top of the in-run was above mean sea level. The tower was tall; the top of the in-run was located behind the tower and was above ground, and the in-run was in length. The landing slope was 37 degrees at the steepest and in length. The vertical height difference between the top of the in-run and the off-run was .
The new hill has a hill size of and K-spot of . The steepest part of the landings slope is 35.7 degrees, which is from the take-off. The angle at the hill size point is 30.8 degrees, while the width of the landing slope is . The in-run, built of steel, is long, which is 36 degrees at the steepest. The take-off is in height, and the height distance from take-off to the K-point is . The grandstands are made of steel and concrete, and include VIP facilities. It is the only hill in the world with a permanent wind screen built as part of the designed construction, and the only steel jump in the world. The hill is above sea level; the venue is owned by Oslo Municipality and operated by the Association for the Promotion of Skiing.

Transport is based on that no spectators will use private cars to the venue. Instead, all spectators must use the Holmenkollen Line of the Oslo Metro. Holmenkollen Station is located within walking distance of the large hill and cross-country stadium. Holmenkollen Station is the only one on the line with platforms long enough for six cars, which allows a capacity of 9,000 people per hour.

In 1896 the cross-country part of Nordic combined was cancelled and ski jumping counted as final result. Ski jumping events listed only:


The Holmenkollen Ski Festival is an annual Nordic skiing event which takes places at Holmenkollen. Until 1932, jumping was part of Nordic combined, and the events were completely dominated by Norwegians. In 1903, Oslo hosted its only version of the Nordic Games, dubbed the Winter Sports Week. Regarded as the precursor of the Winter Olympics, the event featured among other things ski jumping in Holmenkollbakken. The Ski Festival was first held on a Sunday in 1926. Starting in 1933, there was a pure ski jumping competition, which made it easier for foreign jumping specialists to compete for the top positions. Originally, the style scores were secret, creating public discussions about the fairness of judges in even races. This was changed in 1951, when the style scores started being announced over the PA system.

The Holmenkollen Ski Festival has been regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; World Championships prior to the 1924 Winter Olympics. The Norwegian Ski Federation had been an opponent of establishing World Championships and Winter Olympics because they felt it would take away the prestige of the Ski Festival. Oslo was awarded the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1930; with exception of Sweden&#x27;s Erik Rylandet who finished fifth, Norway had the top ten positions.

Holmenkollen was the venue of the Nordic skiing during the 1952 Winter Olympics. Two events were held at Holmenkollbakken: ski jumping and the jumping part of Nordic combined. The exact number of people attending the ski jumping event on 24 February is not known, but it somewhere between 120,000 and 150,000, with the official report stating 143,000. The event was won by Arnfinn Bergmann ahead of Torbjørn Falkanger, both from Norway, and Karl Holmström of Sweden.
The next World Championship was held in 1966. By then both normal and large hill competitions had been introduced, and the normal hill competition would be held at Midtstubakken, as they would later also be done in 1982 and 2011. The 1966 large hill competition was won by Norway&#x27;s Bjørn Wirkola, while the 1982 event was won by Matti Nykänen of Finland.

From the 1979–80 season, FIS introduced the Ski Jumping World Cup. The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup was first held in the 1983–84 season. By 1990, a conflict had arisen between the ski jumpers and the International Ski Federation. On the day of the Ski Festival, the jumpers collectively demanded NOK 150,000 in increased prize money, or threatened to not jump. It was stated that the money would be used for charity, such as resurrecting Romanian ski jumping. The demand was rejected by the organizers, who stated that they would have to disqualify the jumpers, as they would be regarded as professionals, rather than amateurs. Since 1997, the World Cup jumps in Holmenkollen have been part of the Nordic Tournament, which includes four successive jumps in four Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish ski jumps, inspired by the Four Hills Tournament.

During summer, the old hill had a lake, which made it possible to use the amphitheater for concerts, plays and entertainment. The venue was then often referred to as Sommerkollen. From 1963, a temporary, small in-run was built down the southern grandstand, which allowed skiers and divers to make a jump and land in the water. Between 1963 and 1983, a competition was held nine times. Starting in 1983 was &quot;Ta sjansen&quot;, which was televised annually by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and became Sommerkollen&#x27;s most popular show. It was an informal competition with two main events: one where a home-made craft was to first slide down a short in-run and then slide along the water surface to hit a mounted bell in the shortest possible time. The other was a cycling competition where the cyclist had to complete a track on a wobbly floating wharf.

<text>Husebyrennet was a ski jumping competition which was held in Ullern, Oslo, Norway. These yearly competitions, held from 1879 to 1891, were a precursor to the Holmenkollen event. Starting in January 1892, this competition relocated to the Holmenkollbakken in Holmenkollen.

The first competitions held by Christiania SK were different from today&#x27;s ski jumping in that the ski jump formed part of a course that included a 4 km stretch of cross-country skiing (see Nordic combined). No jump lengths were measured. Instead, judges gave points for style, on a scale from 1 to 5.

The ski jump, called &quot;Kastellbakken&quot;, was viewed as gigantic for its time, with length around 20 meters readily achieved. At the first recognized competition held in Husebybakken in 1879, Olaf Haugann of Norway set the first world record for the longest ski jump at 20 meters.

In the first years, Sondre Norheim was dominating. Later, the brothers Mikkjel and Torjus Hemmestveit were dominant. In 1883, Fridtjof Nansen participated, and was a main attraction, having then won fame by finishing the distance Bergen to Oslo on skis. The event became very popular, with up to 10,000 spectators. King Oscar II and Prince Hans of Denmark were among the spectators.

Due to lack of snow, the event was not held in 1880, and in 1890 it was held elsewhere. This uncertainty relating to the conditions led to the competition being moved permanently to the location of what is now Holmenkollbakken in 1892. Today, only a bronze plaque serves as a reminder of the events.

<text>Iraqi Airways Company (), operating as Iraqi Airways, is the national carrier of Iraq, headquartered on the grounds of Baghdad International Airport in Baghdad. It is the second oldest airline in the Middle East. Iraqi Airways operates domestic and regional services; its main base is Baghdad International Airport.

== History ==


===Early history===
Iraqi Airways was founded in 1945 as a department of the Iraqi State Railways and started operating on 28 January 1946 using five De Havilland Dragon Rapides on a service to Syria. With the help of the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), the new airline ordered three Vickers Viking aircraft. While waiting for the Vikings to be delivered, it leased four Douglas DC-3 aircraft from BOAC in December 1946. In 1947, the airline ordered the de Havilland Dove to replace the Dragon Rapides; the Doves were delivered in October 1947. The three new Vikings were delivered at the end of 1947 and the DC-3s returned to BOAC. A fourth Viking was bought second-hand.

In 1953, the four-engined Vickers Viscount turboprop was chosen to replace the Vikings and an order for three was placed in July. The Viscounts entered service in 1955 and operated all of Iraqi Airways&#x27; international services, including a new route to London with intermediate stops. On 1 April 1960, the airline was split from the railway company. In 1961, it placed an order for two Boeing 720Bs for delivery in 1964, but the order was later cancelled.

In the 1960s, Iraqi Airways bought Russian Tupolev Tu-124 planes as well as Hawker Siddeley Trident aircraft. These jets allowed the airline to increase services across the Middle East, to Africa and Europe. At the time, cargo aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-76 were also purchased. During the 1970s, Iraqi Airways needed a bigger jet for a new route to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York; it purchased the Boeing 707 and, soon after, the Boeing 747. Airfares were kept artificially low through state subsidies under the Iraqi Ba&#x27;athist government.

===Later history===
Attempts were made to restart domestic services after the Gulf War in May 1991, and permission was granted by the United Nations to operate helicopters on limited domestic services. Fixed-wing flights were banned under the ceasefire terms, although the UN Security Council agreed to the resumption of domestic flights. These restarted in January 1992 from Baghdad to Basra, using Antonov An-24 aircraft. Operations were suspended shortly after, following a UN ruling.

However, domestic flights became a rarity too, because of the no-fly zone imposed by the United States and United Kingdom over Iraqi skies. During the 1990s, Iraqi Airways would occasionally fly pilgrims to Muslim religious cities.

=== Revival ===
After the Iraq War, on 30 May 2003, Iraqi Airways announced plans to resume international services. The rights to the Iraqi Airways name were transferred to a new and separate company called Iraqi Airways Company, which would establish a new airline and protect it from the legal problems tied to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime. Operations restarted on 3 October 2004, with a flight between Baghdad and Amman.

Iraqi Airways operated the first domestic commercial scheduled service since the fall of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime, from Baghdad to Basra, with 100 passengers in a Boeing 727-200, on 4 June 2005. On 6 November 2005, Iraqi Airways operated a flight from Baghdad to Tehran, Iran, for the first time in twenty-five years. The aircraft, as with the rest of the fleet, was operated on its behalf by Teebah Airlines of Jordan. Services to Erbil and Sulaymaniyah were added in the summer of 2005.

In June 2009, it was revealed that Iraqi Airways had struck a deal with British aviation authorities to resume direct from Baghdad to London Gatwick Airport; the flights were supposed to begin on 8 August 2009 using a Boeing 737-400 leased from Tor Air and would eventually have seen the Airbus A320-200 operating the route. This did not happen as planned, however. The airline said at the time that they intended a bigger expansion into the UK and Europe.

In November 2009, Blue Wings, a German airline, began operating flights to Düsseldorf and Frankfurt, Germany on behalf of Iraqi Airways.

On 25 April 2010, Iraqi Airways launched flights to Gatwick Airport via Malmö, Sweden. When the first flight landed in London, a Kuwaiti lawyer had the General Director Kifah Hassan&#x27;s documents and passport seized, as well as the plane itself. There were no developments, however, as the plane was owned by the Swedish company Tor Air. The plane returned to Baghdad. However, Kifah Hassan was not allowed to leave the United Kingdom and went up in court on 30 April. Kuwaiti officials demanded £780 million for the planes stolen by Saddam Hussein in the 1990 invasion.

On 26 May 2010, Amer Abdul-Jabbar, Iraq&#x27;s transport minister, said the cabinet had decided on Tuesday to dissolve the company over the next three years and pursue private options to avoid asset claims made by Kuwait over their 1990–91 war.

In February 2012, Iraqi Airways announced that it would resume flights to India, with services to Delhi or Mumbai from Baghdad.

In April 2012, it was announced that Iraqi Airways had ordered 40 new Boeing aircraft, the order consisting of 30 Boeing 737-800 and 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The first aircraft would be delivered in December 2012. Airbus in early December delivered its first A330-200 to Iraq, while Boeing delivered a Boeing 777 around the same time as well.

On 14 August 2013, Iraqi Airways took delivery of their first Boeing 737-800 directly from Boeing Company.

In June 2014, Iraqi Airways suspended services to Mosul due to the capture of the city by ISIL.

On 8 September 2015, Iraqi Airways received a loan of $2 billion from a Citibank to finance the purchase of 40 modern aircraft type Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

The airline opened a Request For Proposals (RFP) to European airlines with a valid AOC certification in late 2019. The goal was to obtain agreements to wet lease aircraft that can serve routes between Iraq and Europe.

In 2019, Iraqi Airways saw the resumption of flights to Syria, between Damascus and Baghdad.

Iraqi Airways is one of the few airlines that do not serve alcoholic beverages on their flights.

=== Livery ===
In 2008, Iraqi Airways received a single Bombardier CRJ in an adapted version of Bombardier&#x27;s distinctive blue and white demonstrator livery with Iraqi titles and logos. The rest of the CRJ fleet was delivered in a version of the former green livery and YI-AQA was quickly painted to match. In 2012 Iraqi Airways adopted a new green livery which was applied fleet-wide.

== Destinations ==
In March 2009, Iraqi Airways began its first flights to Sweden in almost 19 years.

In September 2009, the airline resumed flights to Bahrain and Doha, Qatar.

In October 2009, Iraqi Airways resumed flights to Karachi, Pakistan. The airline also started seasonal (Hajj) flights to Jeddah.

After revealing the previous month that it had applied for rights to fly to Malmö, Sweden, Iraqi Airways commenced flights to the city on 28 November 2009.

===Current fleet===



, the Iraqi Airways fleet consists of the following aircraft:
===Fleet development===
In May 2008, the Iraqi government signed a $2.2 billion contract with Boeing for 30 Boeing 737-800s with an option for an additional 10. It was also working on a deal involving the order of ten Boeing 787 Dreamliners aircraft for long-range service.

Another contract worth $398 million was signed for ten Bombardier CRJ-900ER aircraft with ten options. The first CRJ-900ER was delivered in October 2008. This resulted in a lawsuit against Bombardier by Kuwait Airways. Kuwait claims to have won $1.2 billion in judgments against Iraqi Airways as a result of the Gulf War. The Canadian judge ruled that he did not have jurisdiction because the case involved a foreign government, given that the purchaser of the aircraft was the government of Iraq, not Iraqi Airways. The lawsuit by Kuwait Airways was settled in 2009, with Iraq agreeing to pay $300 million.

In February 2010, Iraqi Airways announced major fleet plans, including converting 10 of the 30 orders for the Boeing 737-800 to additional wide bodies as well as bringing the delivery date forward to September 2011, and changing the 10 Boeing 787 Dreamliner orders to Boeing 777 aircraft.

<text>Urinary incontinence (UI), also known as involuntary urination, is any uncontrolled leakage of urine. It is a common and distressing problem, which may have a large impact on quality of life. Urinary incontinence is common in older women and has been identified as an important issue in geriatric health care. The term enuresis is often used to refer to urinary incontinence primarily in children, such as nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting). UI is an example of a stigmatized medical condition, which creates barriers to successful management and makes the problem worse. People may be too embarrassed to seek medical help, and attempt to self-manage the symptom in secrecy from others.
Pelvic surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, attention deficit disorder (ADHD), and menopause are major risk factors. Urinary incontinence is often a result of an underlying medical condition but is under-reported to medical practitioners. There are four main types of incontinence:
* Urge incontinence due to an overactive bladder
* Stress incontinence due to &quot;a poorly functioning urethral sphincter muscle (intrinsic sphincter deficiency) or to hypermobility of the bladder neck or urethra&quot;
* Overflow incontinence due to either poor bladder contraction or blockage of the urethra
* Mixed incontinence involving features of different other types
Treatments include behavioral therapy, pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, medication, surgery, and electrical stimulation. Treatments that incorporate behavioral therapy are more likely to improve or cure stress, urge, and mixed incontinence, whereas, there is limited evidence to support the benefit of hormones and periurethral bulking agents. The complications and long-term safety of the treatments is variable.
==Causes==
Urinary incontinence can result from both urologic and non-urologic causes. Urologic causes can be classified as either bladder dysfunction or urethral sphincter incompetence and may include detrusor overactivity, poor bladder compliance, urethral hypermobility, or intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Non-urologic causes may include infection, medication or drugs, psychological factors, polyuria, hydrocephalus, stool impaction, and restricted mobility. The causes leading to urinary incontinence are usually specific to each sex, however, some causes are common to both men and women.

=== Women ===

The most common types of urinary incontinence in women are stress urinary incontinence and urge urinary incontinence. Women that have symptoms of both types are said to have &quot;mixed&quot; urinary incontinence. After menopause, estrogen production decreases and, in some women, urethral tissue will demonstrate atrophy, becoming weaker and thinner, possibly playing a role in the development of urinary incontinence.

Stress urinary incontinence in women is most commonly caused by loss of support of the urethra, which is usually a consequence of damage to pelvic support structures as a result of pregnancy, childbirth, obesity, age, among others. About 33% of all women experience urinary incontinence after giving birth, and women who deliver vaginally are about twice as likely to have urinary incontinence as women who give birth via a Caesarean section. Stress incontinence is characterized by leaking of small amounts of urine with activities that increase abdominal pressure such as coughing, sneezing, laughing and lifting. This happens when the urethral sphincter cannot close completely due to the damage in the sphincter itself, or the surrounding tissue. Additionally, frequent exercise in high-impact activities can cause athletic incontinence to develop. Urge urinary incontinence, is caused by uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle, a condition known as overactive bladder syndrome. This type of urinary incontinence is more commonly seen in women of older age. It is characterized by leaking of large amounts of urine in association with insufficient warning to get to the bathroom in time.

=== Men ===

Urge incontinence is the most common type of incontinence in men. Similar to women, urine leakage happens following a very intense feeling of urination, not allowing enough time to reach the bathroom, a condition called overactive bladder syndrome. In men, the condition is commonly associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (an enlarged prostate), which causes bladder outlet obstruction, a dysfunction of the detrusor muscle (muscle of the bladder), eventually causing overactive bladder syndrome, and the associated incontinence.

Stress urinary incontinence is the other common type of incontinence in men, and it most commonly happens after prostate surgery. Prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, prostate brachytherapy, and radiotherapy can all damage the urethral sphincter and surrounding tissue, causing it to be incompetent. An incompetent urethral sphincter cannot prevent urine from leaking out of the urinary bladder during activities that increase the intraabdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or laughing. Continence usually improves within 6 to 12 months after prostate surgery without any specific interventions, and only 5 to 10% of people report persistent symptoms.

=== Both ===
* Age is a risk factor that increases both the severity and prevalence of UI
* Polyuria (excessive urine production) of which, in turn, the most frequent causes are: uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, primary polydipsia (excessive fluid drinking), central diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Polyuria generally causes urinary urgency and frequency, but does not necessarily lead to incontinence.
* Neurogenic disorders like multiple sclerosis, spina bifida, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, strokes and spinal cord injury can all interfere with nerve function of the bladder. This can lead to neurogenic bladder dysfunction
* Overactive bladder syndrome. However, the etiology behind this is usually different between men and women, as mentioned above.
* Other suggested risk factors include smoking, caffeine intake and depression

==Mechanism==
=== Adults ===
The body stores urine—water and wastes removed by the kidneys—in the urinary bladder, a balloon-like organ. The bladder connects to the urethra, the tube through which urine leaves the body.

Continence and micturition involve a balance between urethral closure and detrusor muscle activity (the muscle of the bladder). During urination, detrusor muscles in the wall of the bladder contract, forcing urine out of the bladder and into the urethra. At the same time, sphincter muscles surrounding the urethra relax, letting urine pass out of the body. The urethral sphincter is the muscular ring that closes the outlet of the urinary bladder preventing urine to pass outside the body. Urethral pressure normally exceeds bladder pressure, resulting in urine remaining in the bladder, and maintaining continence. The urethra is supported by pelvic floor muscles and tissue, allowing it to close firmly. Any damage to this balance between the detrusor muscle, urethral sphincter, supportive tissue and nerves can lead to some type of incontinence .

For example, stress urinary incontinence is usually a result of the incompetent closure of the urethral sphincter. This can be caused by damage to the sphincter itself, the muscles that support it, or nerves that supply it. In men, the damage usually happens after prostate surgery or radiation, and in women, it&#x27;s usually caused by childbirth and pregnancy. The pressure inside the abdomen (from coughing and sneezing) is normally transmitted to both urethra and bladder equally, leaving the pressure difference unchanged, resulting in continence. When the sphincter is incompetent, this increase in pressure will push the urine against it, leading to incontinence.

Another example is urge incontinence. This incontinence is associated with sudden forceful contractions of the detrusor muscle (bladder muscle), leading to an intense feeling of urination, and incontinence if the person does not reach the bathroom on time. The syndrome is known as overactive bladder syndrome, and it&#x27;s related to dysfunction of the detrusor muscle.

===Children===
Urination, or voiding, is a complex activity. The bladder is a balloon-like muscle that lies in the lowest part of the abdomen. The bladder stores urine and then releases it through the urethra, which is the canal that carries urine to the outside of the body. Controlling this activity involves nerves, muscles, the spinal cord and the brain.

The bladder is made of two types of muscles: the detrusor and the sphincter. The detrusor is a muscular sac that stores urine and squeezes to empty. Connected to the bottom or next of the bladder, the sphincter is a circular group of muscles that automatically stays contracted to hold the urine in. It will automatically relax when the detrusor contracts to let the urine into the urethra. A third group of muscles below the bladder (pelvic floor muscles) can contract to keep urine back.

A baby&#x27;s bladder fills to a set point, then automatically contracts and empties. As the child gets older, the nervous system develops. The child&#x27;s brain begins to get messages from the filling bladder and begins to send messages to the bladder to keep it from automatically emptying until the child decides it is the time and place to void.

Failures in this control mechanism result in incontinence. Reasons for this failure range from the simple to the complex.

==Diagnosis==

The pattern of voiding and urine leakage is important as it suggests the type of incontinence. Other points include straining and discomfort, use of drugs, recent surgery, and illness.

The physical examination looks for signs of medical conditions causing incontinence, such as tumors that block the urinary tract, stool impaction, and poor reflexes or sensations, which may be evidence of a nerve-related cause.

Other tests include:
* Stress test – the patient relaxes, then coughs vigorously as the doctor watches for loss of urine.
* Urinalysis – urine is tested for evidence of infection, urinary stones, or other contributing causes.
* Blood tests – blood is taken, sent to a laboratory, and examined for substances related to causes of incontinence.
* Ultrasound – sound waves are used to visualize the kidneys and urinary bladder, assess the capacity of the bladder before voiding, and the remaining amount of urine after voiding. This helps know if there&#x27;s a problem in emptying.
* Cystoscopy – a thin tube with a tiny camera is inserted in the urethra and used to see the inside of the urethra and bladder.
* Urodynamics – various techniques measure pressure in the bladder and the flow of urine.

People are often asked to keep a diary for a day or more, up to a week, to record the pattern of voiding, noting times and the amounts of urine produced.

Research projects that assess the efficacy of anti-incontinence therapies often quantify the extent of urinary incontinence. The methods include the 1-h pad test, measuring leakage volume; using a voiding diary, counting the number of incontinence episodes (leakage episodes) per day; and assessing of the strength of pelvic floor muscles, measuring the maximum vaginal squeeze pressure.

=== Main types ===
There are 4 main types of urinary incontinence:
# Stress incontinence, also known as effort incontinence, is essentially due to incomplete closure of the urinary sphincter, due to problems in the sphincter itself or insufficient strength of the pelvic floor muscles supporting it. This type of incontinence is when urine leaks during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing or bearing down.
# Urge incontinence is an involuntary loss of urine occurring while suddenly feeling the need or urge to urinate, usually secondary to overactive bladder syndrome.
# Overflow incontinence is the incontinence that happens suddenly without feeling the urge to urinate and without necessarily doing any physical activities. It is also known as under-active bladder syndrome. This usually happens with chronic obstruction of the bladder outlet or with diseases damaging the nerves supplying the urinary bladder. The urine stretches the bladder without the person feeling the pressure, and eventually, it overwhelms the ability of the urethral sphincter to hold it back.
# Mixed incontinence contains symptoms of multiple other types of incontinence. It is not uncommon in the elderly female population and can sometimes be complicated by urinary retention.

=== Other types ===

* Functional incontinence occurs when a person recognizes the need to urinate but cannot make it to the bathroom. The loss of urine may be large. There are several causes of functional incontinence including confusion, dementia, poor eyesight, mobility or dexterity, unwillingness to use the toilet because of depression or anxiety or inebriation due to alcohol. Functional incontinence can also occur in certain circumstances where no biological or medical problem is present. For example, a person may recognize the need to urinate but may be in a situation where there is no toilet nearby or access to a toilet is restricted.
* Structural incontinence: Rarely, structural problems can cause incontinence, usually diagnosed in childhood (for example, an ectopic ureter). Fistulas caused by obstetric and gynecologic trauma or injury are commonly known as obstetric fistulas and can lead to incontinence. These types of vaginal fistulas include, most commonly, vesicovaginal fistula and, more rarely, ureterovaginal fistula. These may be difficult to diagnose. The use of standard techniques along with a vaginogram or radiologically viewing the vaginal vault with instillation of contrast media.
* Nocturnal enuresis is episodic UI while asleep. It is normal in young children.
* Transient incontinence is temporary incontinence most often seen in pregnant women when it subsequently resolves after the birth of the child.
* Giggle incontinence is an involuntary response to laughter. It usually affects children.
* Double incontinence. There is also a related condition for defecation known as fecal incontinence. Due to involvement of the same muscle group (levator ani) in bladder and bowel continence, patients with urinary incontinence are more likely to have fecal incontinence in addition. This is sometimes termed &quot;double incontinence&quot;.
* Post-void dribbling is the phenomenon where urine remaining in the urethra after voiding the bladder slowly leaks out after urination.
* Coital incontinence (CI) is urinary leakage that occurs during either penetration or orgasm and can occur with a sexual partner or with masturbation. It has been reported to occur in 10% to 24% of sexually active women with pelvic floor disorders.
* Climacturia is urinary incontinence at the moment of orgasm. It can be a result of radical prostatectomy.

===Screening===
Yearly screening is recommended for women by the Women&#x27;s Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) and people who test positive in the screening process would need to be referred for further testing to understand how to help treat their condition. Screening questions should inquire about what symptoms they have experienced, how severe the symptoms are, and if the symptoms affect their daily lives. , studies have not shown a change in outcomes with urinary incontinence screenings in women.

==Management==
Treatment options include conservative treatment, behavioral therapy, bladder retraining, pelvic floor therapy, collecting devices (for men), fixer-occluder devices for incontinence (in men), medications, and surgery. Both nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments may be effective for treating UI in non-pregnant women. All treatments, except hormones and periurethral bulking agents, are more effective than no treatment in improving or curing UI symptoms or achieving patient satisfaction. For urinary incontinence in women, it is typical in clinical practice to begin with behavioral therapy, then move on to oral medication if behavioral therapy is ineffective. If both behavioral therapy and oral medication are ineffective, the patient may be given bladder botox or neuromodulation therapy.

=== Behavioral therapy, physical therapy and exercise ===
Behavioral therapy involves the use of both suppressive techniques (distraction, relaxation) and learning to avoid foods that may worsen urinary incontinence. This may involve avoiding or limiting consumption of caffeine and alcohol. Behavioral therapies, including bladder training, biofeedback, and pelvic floor muscle training, are most effective for improving urinary incontinence in women, with a low risk of adverse events. Behavioral therapy is not curative for urinary incontinence, but it can improve a person&#x27;s quality of life. Behavioral therapy has benefits as both a monotherapy (behaviorial therapy alone) and as an adjunct to medications (combining different therapies) for symptom reduction. Time voiding while urinating and bladder training are techniques that use biofeedback. In time voiding, the patient fills in a chart of voiding and leaking. From the patterns that appear in the chart, the patient can plan to empty his or her bladder before he or she would otherwise leak. Biofeedback and muscle conditioning, known as bladder training, can alter the bladder&#x27;s schedule for storing and emptying urine. These techniques are effective for urge and overflow incontinence.

Avoiding heavy lifting and preventing constipation may help with uncontrollable urine leakage. Stopping smoking is also recommended as it is associated with improvements in urinary incontinence in men and women. Weight loss may also be helpful for people who are overweight to improve symptoms of incontinence.

Physical therapy can be effective for women in reducing urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor physical therapists work with patients to identify and treat underlying pelvic muscle dysfunction that can cease urinary incontinence. They may recommend exercises to strengthen the muscles, electrostimulation, or biofeedback treatments. Exercising the muscles of the pelvis such as with Kegel exercises are a first line treatment for women with stress incontinence. Efforts to increase the time between urination, known as bladder training, is recommended in those with urge incontinence. Both these may be used in those with mixed incontinence.

Physical therapy, both by itself and in combination with anticholinergic drugs, was found to be more successful in reducing urinary incontinence in women than anticholinergics by themselves.

Small vaginal cones of increasing weight may be used to help with exercise. They seem to be better than no active treatment in women with stress urinary incontinence, and have similar effects to training of pelvic floor muscles or electrostimulation.

Biofeedback uses measuring devices to help the patient become aware of his or her body&#x27;s functioning. By using electronic devices or diaries to track when the bladder and urethral muscles contract, the patient can gain control over these muscles. Biofeedback can be used with pelvic muscle exercises and electrical stimulation to relieve stress and urge incontinence. The evidence supporting the role for biofeedback devices in treating urinary incontinence is mixed. There is some very weak evidence that electrical stimulation that is low in frequency may be helpful in combination with other standard treatments for women with overactive bladder condition, however, the evidence supporting a role for biofeedback combined with pelvic floor muscle training is very weak and likely indicates that biofeedback-assistance is not helpful when included with conservative treatments for overactive bladder.

Preoperative pelvic floor muscle training in men undergoing radical prostatectomy was not effective in reducing urinary incontinence.

Alternative exercises have been studied for stress urinary incontinence in women. Evidence was insufficient to support the use of Paula method, abdominal muscle training, Pilates, Tai chi, breathing exercises, postural training, and generalized fitness.

===Devices===

Individuals who continue to experience urinary incontinence need to find a management solution that matches their individual situation. The use of mechanical devices has not been well studied in women, as of 2014.
* Collecting systems (for men) – consists of a sheath worn over the penis funneling the urine into a urine bag worn on the leg. These products come in a variety of materials and sizes for individual fit. Studies show that urisheaths and urine bags are preferred over absorbent products – in particular when it comes to &#x27;limitations to daily activities&#x27;. Solutions exist for all levels of incontinence. Advantages with collecting systems are that they are discreet, the skin stays dry all the time, and they are convenient to use both day and night. Disadvantages are that it is necessary to get measured to ensure proper fit, and in some countries, a prescription is needed.
* Absorbent products (include shields, incontinence pads, undergarments, protective underwear, briefs, diapers, adult diapers and underpants) are the best-known product types to manage incontinence. They are widely available in pharmacies and supermarkets. The advantages of using these are that they barely need any fitting or introduction by a healthcare specialist. The disadvantages with absorbent products are that they can be bulky, leak, have odors and can cause skin breakdown due to the constant dampness.
* Intermittent catheters are single-use catheters that are inserted into the bladder to empty it, and once the bladder is empty they are removed and discarded. Intermittent catheters are primarily used for urinary retention (inability to empty the bladder), but for some people they can be used to reduce or avoid incontinence. These are prescription-only medical devices.
* Indwelling catheters (also known as foleys) are often used in hospital settings, or if the user is not able to handle any of the above solutions himself/herself (e.g. severe neurologic injury or neurodegenerative disease). These are also prescription-only medical devices. The indwelling catheter is typically connected to a urine bag that can be worn on the leg or hung on the side of the bed. Indwelling catheters need to be monitored and changed on a regular basis by a healthcare professional. The advantage of indwelling catheters is that because the urine is funneled away from the body, the skin remains dry. However, the disadvantage is that it is very common to incur urinary tract infections when using indwelling catheters. Bladder spasms and other problems can also occur with long-term use of indwelling catheters.
* Penis clamp (or penis compression device), which is applied to compress the urethra to compensate for the malfunctioning of the natural urinary sphincter, preventing leakage from the bladder. This management solution is only suitable for light or moderate incontinence.
* Vaginal pessaries for women are devices inserted into the vagina. This device provides support to the urethra which passes right in front of it, allowing it to close more firmly.

===Medications===
A number of medications exist to treat urinary incontinence including: fesoterodine, tolterodine and oxybutynin. These medications work by relaxing smooth muscle in the bladder. While some of these medications appear to have a small benefit, the risk of side effects are a concern. Medications are effective for about one in ten people, and all medications have similar efficacy.

Medications are not recommended for those with stress incontinence and are only recommended in those with urge incontinence who do not improve with bladder training. While medications have been shown to be helpful with treating urinary incontinence, studies have shown that the first line treatment that&#x27;s most effective against urinary incontinence is behavioral therapy.

Injectable bulking agents may be used to enhance urethral support, however, they are of unclear benefit.

===Surgery===
Women and men that have persistent incontinence despite optimal conservative therapy may be candidates for surgery. Surgery may be used to help stress or overflow incontinence. Common surgical techniques for stress incontinence include slings, tension-free vaginal tape, bladder suspension, artificial urinary sphincters, among others. It is not clear if antibiotics taken prophylactically after surgery are helpful at decreasing the risk of an infection after surgery.

The use of transvaginal mesh implants and bladder slings is controversial due to the risk of debilitating painful side effects such as vaginal erosion. In 2012 transvaginal mesh implants were classified as a high risk device by the US Food and Drug Administration. Urodynamic testing seems to confirm that surgical restoration of vault prolapse can cure motor urge incontinence.

Traditional suburethral sling operations are probably slightly better than open abdominal retropubic colposuspension and are probably slightly less effective than mid-urethral sling operations in reducing urinary incontinence in women, but it is still uncertain if any of the different types of traditional suburethral sling operations are better than others. Similarly, there is insufficient long term evidence to be certain about the effectiveness or safety of single-incision sling operations for urinary incontinence in women. Traditional suburethral slings may have a higher risk of surgical complications than minimally invasive slings but the risk of complications compared with other types of operation is still uncertain.

Laparoscopic colposuspension (keyhole surgery through the abdomen) with sutures is as effective as open colposuspension for curing incontinence in women up to 18 months after surgery, but it is unclear whether there are fewer risk of complications during or after surgery. There is probably a higher risk of complications with traditional suburethral slings than with open abdominal retropubic suspension.

The artificial urinary sphincter is an implantable device used to treat stress incontinence, mostly in men. The device is made of 2 or 3 parts: The pump, cuff, and balloon reservoir connected to each other by specialized tubes. The cuff wraps around the urethra and closes it. When the person wants to urinate, he presses the pump (implanted in the scrotum), to deflate the cuff, and allow the urine to pass. The cuff regains pressure within a few minutes to regain continence. The European Association of Urology considers the artificial urinary sphincter as the gold standard in surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in men after prostatectomy.

== Epidemiology ==
Globally, up to 35% of the population over the age of 60 years is estimated to be incontinent.
In 2014, urinary leakage affected between 30% and 40% of people over 65 years of age living in their own homes or apartments in the U.S. Twenty-four percent of older adults in the U.S. have moderate or severe urinary incontinence that should be treated medically. People with dementia are three times more likely to have urinary incontinence compared to people of similar ages.

Bladder control problems have been found to be associated with higher incidence of many other health problems such as obesity and diabetes. Difficulty with bladder control results in higher rates of depression and limited activity levels.

Incontinence is expensive both to individuals in the form of bladder control products and to the health care system and nursing home industry. Injury-related to incontinence is a leading cause of admission to assisted living and nursing care facilities. In 1997 more than 50% of nursing facility admissions were related to incontinence.

=== Women ===
Approximately 17% of non-pregnant women have urinary incontinence, with the most common types being stress, urgency, and mixed. Bladder symptoms affect women of all ages. However, bladder problems are most prevalent among older women. Women over the age of 60 years are twice as likely as men to experience incontinence; one in three women over the age of 60 years are estimated to have bladder control problems. One reason why women are more affected is the weakening of pelvic floor muscles by pregnancy.

=== Men ===
Men tend to experience incontinence less often than women, and the structure of the male urinary tract accounts for this difference. Stress incontinence is common after prostate cancer treatments.

While urinary incontinence affects older men more often than younger men, the onset of incontinence can happen at any age. Estimates around 2007 suggested that 17 percent of men over age 60, an estimated 600,000 men in the US, experienced urinary incontinence, with this percentage increasing with age.

=== Children ===
Incontinence happens less often after age 5: About 10 percent of 5-year-olds, 5 percent of 10-year-olds, and 1 percent of 17-year-olds experience episodes of incontinence. It is twice as common in girls as in boys.

== History ==
The management of urinary incontinence with pads is mentioned in the earliest medical book known, the Ebers Papyrus (1500 BC).

Incontinence has historically been a taboo subject in Western culture. However, this situation changed some when Kimberly-Clark aggressively marketed adult diapers in the 1980s with actor June Allyson as spokeswoman. Allyson was initially reticent to participate, but her mother, who had incontinence, convinced her that it was her duty in light of her successful career. The product proved a success.

== Law ==
The case &quot;Hiltibran et al v. Levy et al&quot; in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri resulted in that court issuing an order in 2011. That order requires incontinence briefs funded by Medicaid to be given by Missouri to adults who would be institutionalized without them.

== Veterinary medicine ==
Urinary incontinence is a common urological condition in domestic dogs, but is much rarer in domestic cats, which have narrower urethras.
== Research ==
The effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches to treating urinary incontinence is not well studied for some medical conditions. For example, for people who experience urinary incontinence due to stroke, treatment approaches such as physical therapy, cognitive therapy, complementary medicine, and specialized interventions with experienced medical professionals are sometimes suggested, however it is not clear how effective these are at improving incontinence and there is no strong medical evidence to guide clinical practice.

<doc id="179401" wikidata="Q3595905" url="?curid=179401" title="Malayalam literature">
<text>Malayalam, the lingua franca of the Indian state of Kerala and the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puduchery, is one of the six classical languages of India. Malayalam literature comprises those literary texts written in Malayalam, a South-Dravidian language spoken in the Indian state of Kerala. The first travelogue in any Indian language is the Malayalam &quot;Varthamanappusthakam&quot;, written by Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar in 1785. Malayalam literature has been presented with 6 Jnanapith awards, the second-most for any Dravidian language and the third-highest for any Indian language.

The Sangam literature can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam. The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE. It is generally agreed that the Quilon Syrian copper plates of 849/850 CE is the available oldest inscription written in Old Malayalam. The earliest known literary works in Malayalam are &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; (late 12th or early 13th century) and &quot;Thirunizhalmala&quot;, two epic poems written in Old Malayalam. In the subsequent centuries, besides a popular &quot;Pattu&quot; (&quot;song&quot;) literature, the &quot;manipravalam&quot; poetry also flourished. &quot;Manipravalam&quot; (translates &quot;ruby coral&quot;) style consisted of poetry in an admixture of Malayalam and Sanskrit. Then came works such as &quot;champus&quot; and &quot;sandeshakavyas&quot; in which prose and poetry were interspersed. Later, poets like Cherusseri introduced poems on devotional themes.

Designated a &quot;Classical Language in India&quot; in 2013, Malayalam literature developed into the current form mainly by the influence of the poets Cherusseri Namboothiri, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, and Poonthanam Nambudiri, in the 15th and the 16th centuries of Common Era. Thunchathu Ezhuthachchan is also known as &quot;The father of modern Malayalam literature&quot;. Kunchan Nambiar, a poet of 18th century CE, also has contributed much to Malayalam literature in its early form. The Bharathappuzha river, also known as River Ponnani, and its tributaries, have played a major role in the development of modern Malayalam Literature. There were also other important works, in Arabi Malayalam like Muhyadheen Mala, which was also produced in 16th-17th centuries of Common Era. The growth of Arabi Malayalam literature eventually lead to Mappila Songs. The words used in many of the Arabi Malayalam works those date back to 16th-17th centuries of Common Era are also very closer to the modern Malayalam language. Ezhuthachan, a strong proponent of Bhakti movement, is known as the father of Malayalam. His poems are classified under the genre of &quot;kilippattu&quot;.

The prose literature, criticism, and Malayalam journalism began after the latter half of the 18th century CE. Contemporary Malayalam literature deals with social, political, and economic life context. Modern literary movements in Malayalam literature began in the late 19th century with the rise of the famous Modern Triumvirate consisting of Kumaran Asan, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer and Vallathol Narayana Menon. Kumaran Asan was temperamentally a pessimist—a disposition reinforced by his metaphysics—yet all his life was active in promoting his downtrodden Hindu-Ezhava community. Ullor wrote in the classical tradition, appealing for universal love, while Vallathol responded to the human significance of social progress. Contemporary Malayalam poetry deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern poetry is often towards political radicalism. In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Edasseri Govindan Nair, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, and Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book &quot;Kerala Panineeyam&quot; written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in the late 19th century CE.

==Evolution of Malayalam==

The western dialect of Old Tamil spoken in the southwestern Malabar Coast of India was known as &quot;Malanaattu Tamil&quot;/&quot;Malabar Tamil&quot; (Meaning the &quot;Tamil of the hilly region&quot;/the &quot;Tamil of Malabar&quot;) since the ancient Sangam period (300 BCE - 300 CE). Due to the geographical separation of the Malabar Coast from Tamil Nadu, and the presence of Western Ghats mountain ranges in between these two geographical regions, the dialect of Tamil spoken in the territory of the western Malabar Coast of the ancient Chera kingdom was different from that spoken in the Tamil-mainland. The generally held view is that Malayalam was the western coastal dialect Middle Tamil and started separation from Proto-Tamil-Malayalam sometime in the 8th century CE. The renowned poets of Classical Tamil such as Paranar (1st century CE), Ilango Adigal (2nd-3rd century CE), and Kulasekhara Alvar (9th century CE) were Keralites. The Sangam literature can be considered as the ancient predecessor of Malayalam.

Some scholars however believe that both Tamil and Malayalam developed during the prehistoric period from a common ancestor, &#x27;Proto-Tamil-Malayalam&#x27;, and that the notion of Malayalam being a &#x27;daughter&#x27; of Tamil is misplaced. This is based on the fact that Malayalam and several Dravidian languages on the western coast have common archaic features which are not found even in the oldest historical forms of literary Tamil. However they share few striking innovations with Middle Tamil thus making independent descent impossible.

Old Malayalam (&quot;Pazhaya Malayalam&quot;), an inscriptional language found in Kerala from &quot;c.&quot; 9th to &quot;c.&quot; 13th century CE, is the earliest attested form of Malayalam. The start of the development of Old Malayalam from a western coastal dialect of contemporary Tamil (Middle Tamil) can be dated to c. 7th - 8th century CE. It remained a west coast dialect until c. 9th century CE or a little later. The origin of Malayalam calendar dates back to year 825 CE. The formation of the language is mainly attributed to geographical separation of Kerala from the Tamil country. It is generally agreed that the western coastal dialect of Tamil began to separate, diverge, and grow as a distinct language, mainly due to the heavy influence of Sanskrit and Prakrit, those became common prominent languages on Malabar Coast, when the caste system became strong in Kerala under Nambudiri Brahmins.

The Old Malayalam language was employed in several official records and transactions (at the level of the Chera Perumal kings as well as on the village temples). Most of the inscriptions in Old Malayalam were found from the northern districts of Kerala, those lie adjacent to Tulu Nadu. Old Malayalam was mostly written in Vatteluttu script (with Pallava/Southern Grantha characters). Old Malayalam had several features distinct from the contemporary Tamil, which include the Nasalisation of adjoining sounds, Substitution of palatal sounds for dental sounds, Contraction of vowels, and the Rejection of gender verbs.

The Old Malayalam got gradually developed into Middle Malayalam (&quot;Madhyakaala Malayalam&quot;) by the 13th century CE. The Malayalam literature also completely got diverged from Tamil literature by this period. &quot;Kannassa Ramayanam&quot; and &quot;Kannassa Bharatham&quot; by &quot;Rama Panikkar&quot; of the Niranam poets who lived between 1350 and 1450, are representative of this language. The &quot;Champu Kavyas&quot; written by Punam Nambudiri, one among the &quot;Pathinettara Kavikal&quot; (Eighteen and a half poets) in the court of the Zamorin of Calicut, also belong to Middle Malayalam. The literary works of this period were heavily influenced by Manipravalam, which was a combination of contemporary Malayalam and Sanskrit. The scripts of &quot;Kolezhuthu&quot; and &quot;Malayanma&quot; were also used to write Middle Malayalam, in addition to &quot;Vatteluthu&quot; and Grantha script those were used to write Old Malayalam.

The Middle Malayalam was succeeded by Modern Malayalam (&quot;Aadhunika Malayalam&quot;) by the 15th century CE. The poem &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; written by Cherusseri Namboothiri, who was the court poet of the king Udaya Varman Kolathiri (1446 – 1475) of Kolathunadu, is written in modern Malayalam. The language used in &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; is the modern spoken form of Malayalam. During the 16th century CE, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan from the Kingdom of Tanur and Poonthanam Nambudiri from the Kingdom of Valluvanad followed the new trend initiated by Cherussery in their poems. The &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam Kilippattu&quot; and &quot;Mahabharatham Kilippattu&quot; written by Ezhuthachan and &quot;Jnanappana&quot; written by Poonthanam are also included in the earliest form of Modern Malayalam. 

It is Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan who is also credited with the development of Malayalam script into the current form through the intermixing and modification of the erstwhile scripts of &quot;Vatteluttu&quot;, &quot;Kolezhuthu&quot;, and Grantha script, which were used to write the inscriptions and literary works of Old and Middle Malayalam. He further eliminated excess and unnecessary letters from the modified script. Hence, Ezhuthachan is also known as &quot;The Father of modern Malayalam&quot;. The development of modern Malayalam script was also heavily influenced by the Tigalari script, which was used to write the Tulu language. The currently adopted Malayalam script is the only script in India that can be used to write any other language of India as it contain letters to denote both of the Voiced retroflex approximant (/ɻ/) (which is unique to Tamil and Malayalam in India) and the letters unique to Sanskrit (those are not there in the Tamil script). The language used in the Arabi Malayalam works of 16th-17th century CE is a mixture of Modern Malayalam and Arabic. They follow the syntax of modern Malayalam, though written in a modified form of Arabic script, which is known as Arabi Malayalam script.

Kunchan Nambiar introduced a new literary form called &quot;Thullal&quot;, and Unnayi Variyar introduced reforms in &quot;Attakkatha literature&quot;. Modern literary movements in Malayalam literature began in the late 19th century with the rise of the famous Modern Triumvirate consisting of Kumaran Asan, Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer and Vallathol Narayana Menon. The printing, prose literature, and Malayalam journalism, developed after the latter-half of the 18th century CE. In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Edasseri Govindan Nair, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition. Malayalam has also borrowed a lot of its words from various foreign languages, mainly from the Semitic languages including Arabic, and the European languages including Dutch and Portuguese, due to the long heritage of Indian Ocean trade and the Portuguese-Dutch colonisation in the Malabar Coast. 
==Old Malayalam==
===Folk Songs===
Folk songs are the oldest literary form in Malayalam. They were just oral songs. Many of them were related to agricultural activities, including &quot;Pulayar Pattu&quot;, &quot;Pulluvan Pattu&quot;, &quot;Njattu Pattu&quot;, &quot;Koythu Pattu&quot;, etc. Other Ballads of Folk Song period include the &quot;Vadakkan Pattukal&quot; (Northern songs) in North Malabar region and the &quot;Thekkan Pattukal&quot; (Southern songs) in Southern Travancore. Some of the earliest Mappila songs (Muslim songs) were also folk songs.
For the first 600 years of the Malayalam calendar, Malayalam literature remained in a preliminary stage. During this time, Malayalam literature consisted mainly of various genres of songs (&quot;Pattu&quot;). Prominent were songs praising the goddesses of the land, ballads of brave warriors, songs related to the work of a particular caste and songs intended just for entertainment. &quot;Bhadrakali pattu, thottam pattu, Mappila pattu, mavaratham pattu, sasthanga pattu, nizhalkoothu pattu, sarpa pattu, sastham pattu, thiyyattu pattu, pulluvar pattu, mannar pattu, panar pattu, krishi pattu, thamburan pattu, pada pattu, villadichan pattu, onappattu, kummi&quot; and lullaby were some of the major subgenres. These names were not used historically, but are used in modern times to describe the song genres of that time.

===&quot;Ramacharitham&quot;===
&quot;Ramacharitham&quot; is a collection of poems written at the end of the preliminary stage. It is the oldest Malayalam book available, with a possible exception of &quot;Thirunizhalmala&quot;. The collection has 1,814 poems in it. &quot;Ramacharitham&quot; mainly consists of stories from the Yuddha Kanda of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. It was written by a poet with the pen name &quot;Cheeramakavi&quot; who, according to poet Ulloor S Parameswara Iyer, was Sree Veerarama Varman, a king of southern Kerala from AD 1195 to 1208. However the claim that it was written in Southern Kerala is expired on the basis of new discoveries. Other experts, like Chirakkal T Balakrishnan Nair, Dr. K.M. George, M. M. Purushothaman Nair, and P.V. Krishnan Nair, state that the origin of the book is in Kasaragod district in North Malabar region. They cite the use of certain words in the book and also the fact that the manuscript of the book was recovered from Nileshwaram in North Malabar. The influence of &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; is mostly seen in the contemporary literary works of Northern Kerala. The words used in &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; such as &quot;Nade&quot; (&quot;Mumbe&quot;), &quot;Innum&quot; (&quot;Iniyum&quot;), &quot;Ninna&quot; (&quot;Ninne&quot;), Chaaduka (&quot;Eriyuka&quot;) are special features of the dialect spoken in North Malabar (Kasaragod-Kannur region). Furthermore, the Thiruvananthapuram mentioned in &quot;Ramacharitham&quot; is not the Thiruvananthapuram in Southern Kerala. But it is Ananthapura Lake Temple of Kumbla in the northernmost Kasaragod district of Kerala. The word &quot;Thiru&quot; is used just by the meaning &quot;Honoured&quot;. Today it is widely accepted that &quot;Ramacharitham&quot; was written somewhere in North Malabar (most likely near Kasaragod). &quot;Ramacharitham&quot; is considered a book written during the formative years of Malayalam. According to Rev. Dr. Hermann Gundert, who compiled the first dictionary of the Malayalam language, &quot;Ramacharitham&quot; shows the ancient style of the Malayalam language.

==Middle Malayalam==
===Manipravalam===

While the &quot;Pattu&quot; school flourished among certain sections of the society, the literature of the elite was composed in the curious mixture of Sanskrit and Malayalam which is referred to as &quot;Manipravalam&quot;, &quot;mani&quot; meaning ruby (Malayalam) and &quot;pravalam&quot; meaning coral (Sanskrit). &quot;Lilathilakam&quot;, a work on grammar and rhetoric, written in the last quarter of the 14th century discusses the relationship between &quot;Manipravalam&quot; and &quot;Pattu&quot; as poetic forms. It lays special emphasis on the types of words that blend harmoniously. It points out that the rules of Sanskrit prosody should be followed in &quot;Manipravalam&quot; poetry. This particular school of poetry was patronised by the upper classes, especially the Nambudiris. Dramatic performances given in &quot;Koothambalams&quot;, known by the names of &quot;Koothu&quot; and &quot;Koodiyattom&quot;, often used Sanskrit and Malayalam. In &quot;Koodiyattom&quot;, the clown (&quot;vidooshaka&quot;) is allowed to use Malayalam while the hero recites &quot;slokas&quot; in Sanskrit. Tholan, a legendary court poet in the period of the Kulasekhara kings, is believed to have started this practice.

The earliest of these works in the &quot;Manipravalam&quot; school is &quot;Vaisika Tantram&quot; written in the 13th century. It contains about 200 quatrains in Sanskrit metres and is in the form of professional advice given to a prostitute or courtesan by her mother. Each quatrain is composed with care and due weight is given to the rules of rhetoric. Several quatrains of this type are quoted in &quot;Lilathilakam&quot; by way of illustration for the several rules of grammar and rhetoric.

The most representative of the early &quot;Manipravalam&quot; works are the tales of courtesans (&quot;Achi Charitams&quot;) and the Message Poems (&quot;Sandesa Kavyas&quot;). &quot;Unniyachi Charitam, Unnichiruthevi Charitam&quot; and &quot;Unniyadi Charitam&quot; are examples of the former type which is known by the name &quot;champu&quot;. The &quot;Padya&quot; (verse) portion is in Sanskrit metres and the &quot;Gadya&quot; (prose) portion is mostly in Dravidian metres. Authorship of &quot;Unniyachi Charitam&quot; and &quot;Unnichiruthevi Charitam&quot; is not known and only a portion of the works is now available. &quot;Unniyadi Charitam&quot;, which also exists in a fragmented form, is supposed to be written by Damodara Chakkiar. The &quot;Sandesa Kavyas&quot; are an important poetic genre in Sanskrit, and on the model of Kalidasa&#x27;s &quot;Meghadūta&quot; and Lakshmidasa&#x27;s &quot;Sukasandesa&quot;, a number of message poems came to be written first in &quot;Manipravalam&quot; and later in pure Malayalam. The best known among these &quot;sandesas&quot; is perhaps &quot;Unnuneeli Sandesam&quot; written in the 14th century. The poem is written under the pen-name Amruthanilakshi, and some believe that it was written in 1362 CE. The exact identity of the author remains a mystery, but it is widely believed that one of the members of the Travancore Royal Family wrote it.

The next work to be mentioned is &quot;Ramakathapattu&quot;, as it is popularly known, though the author calls it &quot;Ramayanakavyam&quot;. The author is Ayyappilli Asan who lived sometime about 1400 CE at Auvatutura near Kovalam and whom P. K. Narayana Pillai, who discovered the full text of the book in 1965, calls &quot;the Homer of Malayalam.&quot; &quot;Ramakathapattu&quot; contains 3163 songs in 279 &quot;Vrittas&quot; or parts.

===Niranam poets===

While the Manipravala poetry flourished as a diversion from the mainstream, the tradition set up by Cheeraman of &quot;Ramacharitam&quot;and the more enlightened among the anonymous folk poets was resumed and replenished by three writers commonly referred to as Niranam poets, being Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar. They were influenced by the Bhakti movement. The &quot;Bhakti&quot; school was thus revived, and in the place of the excessive sensuality and eroticism of the &quot;Manipravalam&quot; poets, the seriousness of the poetic vocation was reasserted by them. It is believed that they all belonged to the same Kannassa family and that Madhava Panikkar and Sankara Panikkar were the uncles of Rama Panikkar, the youngest of the three. Their most important work is &quot;Kannasa Ramayanam&quot; which is an important link between &quot;Ramacharitam&quot;, &quot;Ramakathapattu&quot; and Ezhuthachan&#x27;s &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam&quot;. Ulloor has said that Rama Panikkar holds the same position in Malayalam literature that Edmund Spenser has in English literature.

===Later Champus and Krishnagatha===
The 15th century CE saw two paralleled movements in Malayalam literature: one spearheaded by the &quot;Manipravalam&quot; works, especially the &quot;Champus&quot;, and the other emanating from the &quot;Pattu&quot; school and adumbrated in Cherusseri&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; (Song of Krishna). The language of the later &quot;Champus&quot; reads more like modern Malayalam than that of the earlier &quot;Champus&quot; and &quot;Sandesa Kavyas&quot;. &quot;Champus&quot; were mostly works of satire and hyperbole was a regular feature of it. The greatest &quot;Champus&quot; of the 15th century is Punam Nambudiri&#x27;s &quot;Ramayanam&quot; which uses Puranic themes and episodes unlike the 14th century &quot;Champus&quot; which were tales of the courtesans. Punam was a court poet of the Zamorin of Calicut. Punam also wrote a &quot;Bharatam Champoo&quot;. There are also many others, the authorship of which is ascribed to him. The later &quot;Champus&quot; came to be used for dramatic oral narration by performing artists in their &quot;Koothu&quot; and &quot;Patakam&quot;. Mahishamangalam (or Mazhamangalam) Narayanan Nambudiri who lived in the 16th century is the author of some of the best &quot;Champus&quot; of all time. The most widely known of these is &quot;Naishadham&quot; followed by &quot;Rajaratnavaliyam&quot; and &quot;Kodia Viraham&quot;. &quot;Chandrotsavam&quot;, whose authorship is unknown, is a long narrative poem written in &quot;Manipravalam&quot;.

The elitist &quot;Manipravala&quot; &quot;Champu&quot; school disappeared by the end of the 16th century. The average readers without much grounding in Sanskrit had their favourite poems and poets in the so-called &quot;Pattu&quot; school. With the writing of &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; by Cherusseri, the validity of the use of spoken Malayalam for literary purposes received its ultimate justification. Unlike the language of &quot;Ramacharitam&quot; and the works of the Niranam poets, the language of &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; marks the culmination of a stage of evolution. There is some dispute about the author&#x27;s name and his identity. Some scholars are of opinion that he was the same as the Punam Nambudiri of the &quot;Champus&quot;. It is widely believed that Cherusseri lived in the 15th century CE and was the court poet of Udayavarma of Kolathunadu.

===Arabi Malayalam===
The Arabi Malayalam (also called Mappila Malayalam and Moplah Malayalam) was the traditional Dravidian language of the Mappila Muslim community in Malabar Coast. The poets like Moyinkutty Vaidyar and Pulikkottil Hyder have made notable contributions to the Mappila songs, which is a genre of the Arabi Malayalam literature. The Arabi Malayalam script, otherwise known as the Ponnani script, is a writing system - a variant form of the Arabic script with special orthographic features - which was developed during the early medieval period and used to write Arabi Malayalam until the early 20th century CE. Though the script originated and developed in Kerala, today it is predominantly used in Malaysia and Singapore by the migrant Muslim community.

==Evolution of Modern Malayalam==

The Middle Malayalam (&quot;Madhyakaala Malayalam&quot;) was succeeded by Modern Malayalam (&quot;Aadhunika Malayalam&quot;) by the 15th century CE. The poem &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; written by Cherusseri Namboothiri, who was the court poet of the king Udaya Varman Kolathiri (1446 – 1475) of Kolathunadu, is written in modern Malayalam. The language used in &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; is the modern spoken form of Malayalam. During the 16th century CE, Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan from the Kingdom of Tanur and Poonthanam Nambudiri from the Kingdom of Valluvanad followed the new trend initiated by Cherussery in their poems. The &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam Kilippattu&quot; and &quot;Mahabharatham Kilippattu&quot; written by Ezhuthachan and &quot;Jnanappana&quot; written by Poonthanam are also included in the earliest form of Modern Malayalam.

It is Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan who is also credited with the development of Malayalam script into the current form through the intermixing and modification of the erstwhile scripts of &quot;Vatteluttu&quot;, &quot;Kolezhuthu&quot;, and Grantha script, which were used to write the inscriptions and literary works of Old and Middle Malayalam. He further eliminated excess and unnecessary letters from the modified script. Hence, Ezhuthachan is also known as &quot;The Father of modern Malayalam&quot;. The development of modern Malayalam script was also heavily influenced by the Tigalari script, which was used to write the Tulu language, due to the influence of Tuluva Brahmins in Kerala. The language used in the Arabi Malayalam works of 16th-17th century CE is a mixture of Modern Malayalam and Arabic. They follow the syntax of modern Malayalam, though written in a modified form of Arabic script, which is known as Arabi Malayalam script.

P. Shangunny Menon ascribes the authorship of the medieval work &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, which describes the Parashurama legend and the departure of the final Cheraman Perumal king to Mecca, to Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan. The currently adopted Malayalam script, adopted by Ezhuthachan can be used to write any other language of India as it contain letters to denote both of the Voiced retroflex approximant (/ɻ/) (which is unique to Dravidian languages in India) and the letters unique to Sanskrit (those are not there in the Tamil script).

==Modern Malayalam==
===Bhakti era===
Malayalam literature passed through a tremendous process of development in the 15th and 16th centuries. Cherusseri&#x27;s &quot;Krishnagatha&quot; bore witness to the evolution of modern Malayalam language as a proper medium for serious poetic communication. Alongside this, there flourished numerous Sanskrit poets who were very active during this period. The greatest of them was Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri (1559–1665), the author of &quot;Narayaniyam&quot;. The most significant development of the time took place in the field of Malayalam poetry. Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan wrote his two great epics &quot;Adhyathmaramayanam&quot; and &quot;Srimahabharatam&quot; and two shorter pieces, &quot;Irupathinalu Vrittam&quot; and &quot;Harinama Kirtanam&quot; and thereby revolutionised Malayalam language and literature at once. Ezhuthachan refined the style of Malayalam language and it was during his period that Malayalam literature attained its individuality and Malayalam became a fully fledged independent language. Today he is known as the father of Malayalam language and its literature. The &quot;Kilippattu&quot; form he adopted in &quot;Ramayanam&quot; and &quot;Bharatam&quot; may be a pointer to his recognition of the importance of sound effect in poetry. Ezhuthachan is perhaps the greatest spokesman of the Bhakti movement in Malayalam but he is more than a writer of devotional hymns. K. Ayyappa Paniker has noted that &quot;the transition from Cherrusseri to Ezhuthachan marks the triumph of modernism over medievalism.&quot; Another important poet of this period was Poonthanam Nambudiri (1547–1640). His chief poems are &quot;Jnanappana&quot; (The Song of Divine Wisdom), &quot;Bhasha Karnamritam&quot; and &quot;Kumaraharanam&quot; or &quot;Santanagopalam Pana&quot;.

===Performance arts===
The 16th century also saw the writing of some dramatic works in &quot;Manipravalam&quot; and pure Malayalam, &quot;Bharatavakyam&quot;, often described as a choral narration, is a work in &quot;Manipravalam&quot; which was used for stage performance. The main development in the cultural field in Kerala in the 17th century was the growth of a new form of visual art called Kathakali, which brought into being a new genre of poetry called Attakkatha consisting of the libretto used for a Kathakali performance. The origins of &quot;aattakatha&quot; literature dates back to the 12th century and it emerged as a literary genre in the 17th century. The earliest of the &quot;aattakathas&quot; is believed to be a cycle of eight &quot;Ramayana&quot; stories (collectively known as &quot;Ramanattam&quot;), composed by Kottarakkara Tampuran and about whose date there is an ongoing controversy. Next in importance are the works of Kottayathu Tampuran whose period is about the middle of the seventeenth century. Since the four &quot;aattakatha&quot;s he wrote &quot;Bakavadham, Kalyanasaugandhikam, Kirmeeravadham&quot; and &quot;Kalakeyavadham&quot; punctiliously conform to the strict rules of Kathakali, they are particularly favoured by orthodox artistes and their patrons. Another poet of this category is Irayimman Thampi (1783–1863). Unnayi Variyar&#x27;s &quot;Nalacharitham Aattakatha&quot; is one of the most famous works in this genre. &quot;Margamkali&quot; was the form of ritual and entertainment among the Syrian Christians corresponding to the &quot;Sanghakali&quot; of the Brahmins. &quot;Margamkalippattu&quot; is the song for this performance depicting the story of Thomas the Apostle. This was one of the numerous pieces of Christian literature that must have gained currency in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In the court of Travancore king Marthanda Varma (1706–1758) and his successor Dharma Raja Kartika Tirunal Rama Varma, there flourished a number of poets distinguished in several ways. Ramapurathu Warrier (1703–1753), the author of &quot;Kuchela Vrittam Vanchippattu&quot;, was one of them. The &quot;Vanchippattu&quot; or Boat song is a poetic form of folk origin composed entirely in the Dravidian metre &quot;nathonnata&quot;. Kunchan Nambiar (1705–1770), the founder of Thullal and its rich literature, is often considered as the master of Malayalam satirist poetry. Born in Killikkurussimangalam, he spent his boyhood at Kudamalur and youth at Ambalappuzha. 1748 he moved to the court of Marthanda Varma and later to the court of his successor Dharma Raja. The word &quot;Thullal&quot; literally means &quot;dance&quot;, but under this name Nambiar devised a new style of verse narration with a little background music and dance-like swinging movement to wean the people away from the Chakkiyar Koothu, which was the art form popular till then. He used pure Malayalam as opposed to the stylised and Sanskritised Malayalam language of Chakkiyar Koothu. He also adopted many elements from Padayani and Kolam Thullal and certain local folk arts. There are three kinds of Tullal distinguished on the basis of the performer&#x27;s costume and the style of rendering, viz., &quot;Ottan, Sitankan&quot; and &quot;Parayan&quot;. Dravidian metres are used throughout although there is a quatrain in a Sanskrit metre.

===Prose literature===
There was a great lull in the field of literary creation in Malayalam for nearly a century after the death of Kunchan Nambiar. There was however a consistent and steady development of prose at this time. The evolution of prose literature in the early centuries was a very slow process. In the wake of &quot;Bhashakautaliyam&quot; several translations began to appear in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The prose of &quot;Attaprakarams&quot; was meant to aid the Chakiyars in learning the art of Koodiyattom. &quot;Doothavakyam&quot; (14th century CE) is one of the earliest of these works. 15th century Malayalam prose is represented by &quot;Brahmanda Puranam&quot;, a summary of the original in Sanskrit. A large number of prose works appeared during this period, most of which are either narrative based on &quot;puranas&quot; and religious works in Sanskrit or commentaries on similar works. With the starting of the first printing presses in the 16th century by Christian missionaries, prose literature received a great boost. Several regional versions of &quot;Keralolpathi&quot;, tracing the beginnings of Kerala history, began to appear in the 18th century. Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar (1737–1799) wrote the first travelogue in Malayalam, &quot;Varthamanapustakam&quot; (Book of News). The works of Christian missionaries like Arnos Patiri (Johann Ernst Hanxleden), 1699–1732) and Paulinose Patiri (John Philip Wesdin, 1748–1806) also led to a widening of the range of topics and themes in Malayalam literature.

===Venmani school===

The third quarter of the nineteenth century bore witness to the rise of a new school of poets devoted to the observation of life around them and the use of pure Malayalam (&quot;Pachcha Malayalam&quot;). The major poets of the Venmani school were Venmani Achhan Nambudiripad (1817–1891), Venmani Mahan Nambudiripad (1844–1893), Poonthottam Achhan Nambudiri (1821–1865), Poonthottam Mahan Nambudiri (1857–1896) and the members of the Kodungallur Kovilakam (Royal Family) such as Kodungallur Kunjikkuttan Thampuran. The style of these poets became quite popular for a while and influenced even others who were not members of the group like Velutheri Kesavan Vaidyar (1839–1897) and Perunlli Krishnan Vaidyan (1863–1894). The Venmani school pioneered a style of poetry that was associated with common day themes, and the use of pure Malayalam rather than Sanskrit. The poetry was therefore easily understood by the common man. The works were known for its humour, wit, and lyrical metre.

==Modern prose literature==

Contemporary Malayalam poetry deals with social, political, and economic life context. The tendency of the modern poetry is often towards political radicalism. Nineteenth century was not a very creative period for Malayalam literature (except towards the end) from the point of view of imaginative writing. The modern Malayalam grammar is based on the book &quot;Kerala Panineeyam&quot; written by A. R. Raja Raja Varma in the late 19th century CE. But the foundations for the great renaissance that began at the end of the century were laid during this period. The establishment of colleges for imparting English education, the translation of the Bible and other religious works, the compilation of dictionaries and grammars, the formation of the text book committee, the growth of printing presses, the starting of newspapers and periodicals, the introduction of science and technology, the beginning of industrialisation and the awakening of social and political consciousness: these constitute the giant strides towards modernisation. Like his predecessors Swathi Thirunal and Uthram Thirunal, Ayilyam Thirunal (1832–1880) and Visakham Thirunal (1837–1885) were great patrons of letters and were themselves talented writers. Christian missionaries Benjamin Bailey (1805–1871), Joseph Peet, Richard Collins and George Mathen (1819–1870) were responsible for many works on Malayalam language based on western models. Perhaps the most important of these missionaries was Herman Gundert (1814–1893). Born in Stuttgart in Germany and educated at Tübingen and Switzerland, Gundert came to India in 1836. He wrote over twenty books in Malayalam, the most important of which are &quot;A Malayalam-English Dictionary, A Grammar of Malayalam, Keralappazhama&quot; and &quot;Pazhamcholmala&quot;. The first authoritative grammar of Malayalam was also Gundert&#x27;s contribution (1851). This led to the production of a number of grammatical works in Malayalam. Vaikkam Patchu Moothathu (1814–1883) published his &quot;Grammar of Malayalam&quot; in 1876, &quot;Kerala Kaumudi&quot; by Kovunni Nedungadi (1831–1889) came out in 1878. This was soon followed by the first history of the language by P. Govinda Pillai (1849–1897) published in 1881. The first work on rhetoric in Malayalam on the European model was brought out by Father Gerad under the title &quot;Alankara Sastram&quot; in the same year. By the end of the 19th century two different traditions could be clearly distinguished in Malayalam literature: the western school and the oriental or traditionalist school. Writers such as Kerala Varma Valiya Koyithampuran represent the confluence of these two major traditions. His major works include &quot;Mayurasandesam&quot; (Peacock Message) and the translations of Kalidasa&#x27;s &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot; (which got him the title of Kerala Kalidasa), and of Von Limburg Brower&#x27;s &quot;Akbar&quot;. Meanwhile, many literary magazines were established to encourage all kinds of writers and writings, such as C. P. Achutha Menon&#x27;s &quot;Vidyavinodini&quot;, Kandathil Varghese Mappillai&#x27;s &quot;Bhashaposhini&quot; and Appan Thampuran&#x27;s &quot;Rasikaranjini&quot;.

In the wake of Kerala Varma&#x27;s translation of &quot;Abhijñānaśākuntalam&quot;, several attempts were made to translate numerous plays from Sanskrit and English into Malayalam. These plays were seldom acted. The stage conditions of those days were crude and unfit to project a performance. As if irritated by this imitation plays of low quality, P. Rama Kurup wrote &quot;Chakki Chankaram&quot; (1893). Kerala Varma&#x27;s nephew A. R. Raja Raja Varma went a step further than his uncle in the promotion of a synthesis between the different trends current in the literature of his time. A professor in the His Highness Maharaja&#x27;s University College, Thiruvananthapuram, he had to modernise the process of teaching Malayalam language and literature; this made him write books on grammar and rhetoric (which earned him the title of Kerala Panini) and eventually prepare the ground for an enlightened renaissance in Malayalam poetry and literary criticism. A close associate of both Kerala Varma and Raja Raja Varma, K. C. Kesava Pillai wrote &quot;Kesaviyam&quot; (a &quot;mahakavya&quot;) and a number of &quot;attakkathas&quot;. Azhakathu Padmanabha Kurup (1869–1932: author of &quot;Ramachandravilasam&quot;), Pandalam Kerala Varma (1879–1919: author of &quot;Rukmangatha Charitam&quot;), Kattakkayam Cherian Mappila (1859 – 1937: author of &quot;Sri Yesu Vijayam&quot;), Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer (1877–1949 : author of &quot;Umakeralam&quot;) and Vallathol Narayana Menon (1879–1958: author of &quot;Chitrayogam&quot;), all paid their obeisance to this neoclassicist trend.

The developments in prose at this time were very significant, Vengayil Kunhiraman Nayanar (1861–1895), more famous under his pseudonym Kesari, was one of the first to explore the essay form in Malayalam. He was closely associated with periodicals like &quot;Kerala Chandrika&quot; (started in 1879 at Thiruvananthapuram), &quot;Kerala Patrika&quot; (started in 1884 by C. Kunhiraman Menon (1854–1936) and Appu Nedungadi (1866–1934) at Kozhikode), &quot;Kerala Sanchari&quot; (after 1898 under the editorship of Murkoth Kumaran) and the English Journal &quot;Malabar Spectator&quot;. His &quot;Vasanavikriti&quot; is considered by historians and literary experts as the first short story in Malayalam literature. It was published in &quot;Vidyavinodini&quot; in 1891. Along with Nayanar, the pioneers of short stories in Malayalam were Oduvil Kunhikrishna Menon, C. S. Gopala Panicker, Ambadi Narayana Poduval, Chenkulath Cheriya Kunhirama Menon (M. R. K. C.) and Moorkoth Kumaran. &quot;Fulmoni Ennum Koruna Ennum Peraya Randu Sthreekalude Katha&quot; (Phulmōni ennuṁ kōruṇa ennuṁ pērāya ranṭu strīkaḷuṭe katha), a translation of Hana Catherine Mullens&#x27;s Bengali novel &quot;Fulmoni O Korunar Biboron&quot; by Rev. Joseph Peet, is believed to be the first novel printed and released in Malayalam (1858). &quot;Ghathakawadham&quot; (&quot;Ghātakavadhaṁ&quot;, 1877) by Rev. Richard Collins was the first novel printed and published in Malayalam with a story based in Kerala and around Malayalis.

The first novel conceived and published in Malayalam was Appu Nedungadi&#x27;s &quot;Kundalatha&quot; (1887). Though &quot;Kundalatha&quot; is not considered a major novel, it gets the pride of place as the first work in the language having the basic characteristics of a novel. O. Chandhu Menon&#x27;s &quot;Indulekha&quot; was the first major novel in Malayalam language. It was a landmark in the history of Malayalam literature and initiated the novel as a new flourishing genre. The title refers to the main character in this novel, a beautiful, well educated Nair lady of 18 years. C. V. Raman Pillai&#x27;s &quot;Marthandavarma&quot; (1891) had many distinctions: it was the first historical novel in any South Indian languages, first novel from Travancore, first Malayalam novel to be a part of a trilogy and the first Malayalam novel to have a masculine title. &quot;Marthandavarma&quot; was completed even before &quot;Indulekha&quot; but could not be published until 1891 owing to lack of finance. The novel recounted the history of Venad (Travancore) during the final period of Rajah Rama Varma&#x27;s reign and subsequently to the accession of Marthanda Varma. The novel had a film adaptation of the same name in 1933 and was the first Malayalam novel to be adapted into film. During the early 20th century, Malayalam received outstanding novels, either as translations or adaptations of Western literature. The post-independence period saw a fresh start in the history of longer fiction in Malayalam as in many other Indian languages, parallel to the evolution of post-world war fiction in other parts of the world. It was both a break and a continuation. P. Kesava Dev, who was a Communist in the thirties and forties turned away from diehard ideologies and wrote a symbolic novel called &quot;Arku Vendi?&quot; (For Whose Sake?) in 1950, challenging the philosophy of Stalinist liquidation of political enemies. It had a special significance in the context of the &#x27;Calcutta thesis&#x27;. After portraying the class struggle of farm labourers in &quot;Randidangazhi&quot; (Two Measures) in 1949, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai turned away from party politics and produced a moving romance in &quot;Chemmeen&quot; (Shrimps) in 1956. For S. K. Pottekkatt and Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, who had not dabbled in politics, the continuity is marked in the former&#x27;s &quot;Vishakanyaka&quot; (Poison Maid, 1948) and the latter&#x27;s &quot;Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu&quot; (My Grandpa had an Elephant, 1951). The non-political social or domestic novel was championed by P. C. Kuttikrishnan (Uroob) with his &quot;Ummachu&quot; (1955) and &quot;Sundarikalum Sundaranmarum&quot; (Men and Women of Charm, 1958). In 1957 Basheer&#x27;s &quot;Pathummayude Aadu&quot; (Pathumma&#x27;s Goat) brought in a new kind of prose tale, which perhaps only Basheer could handle with dexterity. The fifties thus mark the evolution of a new kind of fiction, which had its impact on the short stories as well. This was the auspicious moment for the entry of M. T. Vasudevan Nair and T. Padmanabhan upon the scene. Front runners in the post-modern trend include Kakkanadan, O. V. Vijayan, E. Harikumar, M. Mukundan and Anand. The travelogues written by S. K. Pottekkatt were turning point in the travelogue literature. Prominent literary critics of twentieth century include Kuttikrishna Marar.

In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, Edasseri Govindan Nair, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, O. N. V. Kurup, and Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri, had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition. Kerala has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam.
