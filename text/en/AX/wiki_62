<text>Victoria of Baden (; 7 August 1862 – 4 April 1930) was Queen of Sweden from 8 December 1907 until her death in 1930 as the wife of King Gustaf V. She was politically active in a conservative fashion during the development of democracy and known to be pro-German during the First World War.

==Early life==
Princess Victoria was born on 7 August 1862 at Karlsruhe Palace, Baden. Her parents were Grand Duke Frederick I of Baden, and Princess Louise of Prussia. Victoria was named after her aunt by marriage, Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia, daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

Victoria was tutored privately in the Karlsruhe Palace, by governesses and private teachers, in an informal &quot;Palace School&quot; with carefully selected girls from the aristocracy. She was given a conventional education for her gender and class with focus on art, music and languages, and could play the piano, paint and speak French and English. Victoria was given a strict and Spartan upbringing with a focus on duty. Among other things, her mother ordered her to sleep on hard mattresses by an open window. Such spartan methods was recommended at the time as beneficial and something that would harden the child&#x27;s future health, but it is believed that this in fact had negative consequences for Victoria&#x27;s health later in life.

Victoria was confirmed in 1878. After this, she made her debut in adult social life and marriage prospects were discussed.

==Crown Princess==
On 20 September 1881 in Karlsruhe Princess Victoria married Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and Norway, the son of King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway and Sofia of Nassau. The German emperor and empress were present at the wedding, and marriage was arranged as a sign that Sweden belonged to the German sphere of influence in Europe. The marriage was popular in Sweden, where she was called &quot;The Vasa Princess&quot; because of her descent from the old Vasa dynasty, and she received a very elaborate welcome on the official cortege into Stockholm 1 October 1881. On 1 February 1882, Victoria and Gustaf visited Oslo, where they were welcomed with a procession of 3,000 torch bearers.

She and Gustaf were brought together by their families and their marriage was reported not to have been a happy one. Their marriage produced three children. In 1890–1891, Victoria and Gustaf travelled to Egypt in an attempt to repair their relationship, but it did not succeed, allegedly due to Victoria&#x27;s interest in one of the courtiers, and she repeated the trip to Egypt in 1891–1892. After 1889, the personal relationship between Victoria and Gustaf is considered to have been finished, in part, as estimated by Lars Elgklou, due to Gustaf&#x27;s bisexuality. She suffered from postnatal depression after the birth of her first child in 1882, and after this, she often spent the winters at spas abroad. She would continue to spend the winters outside Sweden from that year until her death. By 1888, her winter trips had made her unpopular, and she was described as very haughty. In 1889, she had pneumonia, and was formally ordered by her doctors to spend the cold Swedish winters in a southern climate. She had conflicts with her parents-in-law about her expensive stays abroad.

She greatly disapproved of the marriage between her brother-in-law Prince Oscar and her lady-in-waiting Ebba Munck af Fulkila in 1888. 
She is described as strong-willed and artistically talented. She was an accomplished amateur photographer and painter, and she also sculpted. On her travels in Egypt and Italy she both photographed and painted extensively, and experimented with various photo-developing techniques, producing high-quality photographic work. She was also an excellent pianist and, for example, could play through the complete &quot;Ring of the Nibelung&quot; by Wagner without notes. She had had a good music education, and in her youth she had turned the notes at court concerts for Franz Liszt. Her favourite composers were Schubert and Beethoven. She was also described as a skillful rider.

==Queen==
Victoria became Queen-consort of Sweden with her father-in-law&#x27;s death on 8 December 1907. As queen, she was present in Sweden only during the summers, but she still dominated the court. She arranged the marriage between her son Wilhelm and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia in 1908. She was also devoted to various kinds of charity, in Sweden, Germany and Italy.

Queen Victoria had substantial political influence over her husband, who was often considered pro-German. In 1908, Victoria made an official visit to Berlin with Gustaf, where she was made an honorary Prussian Colonel of the 34th (Pomeranian) Fusiliers by her cousin Wilhelm II. She was described as strict and militant, and it was said that she had the heart of a Prussian soldier. She was very strict with discipline, and if any member of the palace guard forgot to salute her, he was generally put under arrest. Swedish court life was also dominated by a certain stiffness, upheld by her favoured lady in waiting, Helene Taube. Victoria was deeply conservative in her views and resented the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian union in 1905, the Great Strike of 1909, and the 1911 election victory of the radicals and the Socialists as well as the liberals, and when her son was temporary regent in 1912, she warned him in letters from Italy that he should not be too &quot;intimate&quot; with the elected government.

Queen Victoria lost much popularity among Swedes for her often noted pro-German attitude, particularly politically during World War I when she is said to have influenced her husband to a large extent. During World War I, she gave a personal gift to every Swedish volunteer to the German forces. She kept up a close contact with her first cousin, German Emperor Wilhelm II, whom she often visited during the war She founded &quot;Drottningens centralkomittée&quot; (&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Central Committee&quot;) for defence equipment. She deeply resented the social democratic election victories in 1917 and worked to prevent them from taking part in the government. Victoria&#x27;s political influence was founded upon the power position of her first cousin, the German Emperor and King of Prussia, and in 1918–19, after he was deposed, she lost all political influence in Sweden.

Queen Victoria suffered from very poor health (much of it due to poor treatment by several doctors in her youth), and often went on trips to try to improve it (she suffered from bronchitis and possibly tuberculosis). She was treated with mercury and unduly heavy medications during her difficult pregnancies, possibly the cause of her chronic conditions. From 1892 to her death, Axel Munthe was her personal physician, and recommended for health reasons that she spend winters on the Italian island of Capri. While initially hesitant, in the autumn of 1901 she travelled to Capri, arriving to an official welcome and a crowd that escorted her from the Marina Grand to the Hotel Paradise. From then on, except during World War I and for the last two years of her life, she spent several months a year on Capri. After some time, she decided to purchase her own residence on Capri, an intimate rustic two-storey farmhouse she named Casa Caprile, which she had extensively landscaped, surrounding it with a dense park. In the 1950s, twenty years after her death, the property became a hotel.

The Queen went to Munthe&#x27;s residence, the Villa San Michele, most mornings to join Munthe for walks around the island. Munthe and the Queen also arranged evening concerts at San Michele, at which the Queen played the piano. They also shared a love of animals, with the Queen frequently being seen with a leashed dog, and she was known to support Munthe&#x27;s (eventually successful) efforts to purchase Mount Barbarossa for use as a bird sanctuary. It was rumoured that Munthe and the Queen were lovers, but this has never been confirmed.

Queen Victoria spent a lot of her time abroad for health reasons, as the Swedish climate was not considered good for her, and during her last years as queen, she was seldom present in Sweden: she participated in an official visit to Norrland in 1921, a visit to Dalarna in 1924, and to Finland in 1925. The visit to Finland was her last official appearance as queen; although she did visit Sweden at her husband&#x27;s birthday 1928, she did not show herself to the public. During those celebrations, however, someone noticed the figure of a woman behind a curtain in the Royal Palace of Stockholm: he waved to her, and she waved back with her handkerchief. After this, she left Sweden for Italy for good: she died two years afterwards.

She was the 855th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa.
==Death==
Toward the end of her life, with her health declining, Munthe recommended she no longer spend time in Capri, and she returned to Sweden for some time, building a Capri-styled villa there. She then moved to Rome.

Her final visit to Sweden was on her husband&#x27;s 70th birthday in June 1928, and Queen Victoria died on 4 April 1930 in her home &quot;Villa Svezia&quot; in Rome aged 67.

<doc id="182146" wikidata="Q842433" url="?curid=182146" title="Orbital mechanics">
<text>Orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical concerning the motion of rockets, satellites, and other spacecraft. The motion of these objects is usually calculated from Newton&#x27;s laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. Astrodynamics is a core discipline within space-mission design and control.

Celestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity, including both spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets, moons, and comets. Orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers, orbital plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers.

General relativity is a more exact theory than Newton&#x27;s laws for calculating orbits, and it is sometimes necessary to use it for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations (e.g. orbits near the Sun).

==History==
Until the rise of space travel in the twentieth century, there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics. At the time of Sputnik, the field was termed &#x27;space dynamics&#x27;. The fundamental techniques, such as those used to solve the Keplerian problem (determining position as a function of time), are therefore the same in both fields. Furthermore, the history of the fields is almost entirely shared.

Johannes Kepler was the first to successfully model planetary orbits to a high degree of accuracy, publishing his laws in 1605. Isaac Newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687), which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabolic path from three observations. This was used by Edmund Halley to establish the orbits of various comets, including that which bears his name. Newton&#x27;s method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by Leonhard Euler in 1744, whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by Johann Lambert in 1761–1777.

Another milestone in orbit determination was Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s assistance in the &quot;recovery&quot; of the dwarf planet Ceres in 1801. Gauss&#x27;s method was able to use just three observations (in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination), to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit. The theory of orbit determination has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in GPS receivers as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed minor planets. Modern orbit determination and prediction are used to operate all types of satellites and space probes, as it is necessary to know their future positions to a high degree of accuracy.

Astrodynamics was developed by astronomer Samuel Herrick beginning in the 1930s. He consulted the rocket scientist Robert Goddard and was encouraged to continue his work on space navigation techniques, as Goddard believed they would be needed in the future. Numerical techniques of astrodynamics were coupled with new powerful computers in the 1960s, and humans were ready to travel to the Moon and return.

==Practical techniques==
===Rules of thumb===
The following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below. The specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet, but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations, such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the Sun.

*Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion:
**Orbits are elliptical, with the heavier body at one focus of the ellipse. A special case of this is a circular orbit (a circle is a special case of ellipse) with the planet at the center.
**A line drawn from the planet to the satellite sweeps out &quot;equal areas in equal times&quot; no matter which portion of the orbit is measured.
**The square of a satellite&#x27;s orbital period is proportional to the cube of its average distance from the planet.
*Without applying force (such as firing a rocket engine), the period and shape of the satellite&#x27;s orbit will not change.
*A satellite in a low orbit (or a low part of an elliptical orbit) moves more quickly with respect to the surface of the planet than a satellite in a higher orbit (or a high part of an elliptical orbit), due to the stronger gravitational attraction closer to the planet.
*If thrust is applied at only one point in the satellite&#x27;s orbit, it will return to that same point on each subsequent orbit, though the rest of its path will change. Thus one cannot move from one circular orbit to another with only one brief application of thrust.
*From a circular orbit, thrust applied in a direction opposite to the satellite&#x27;s motion changes the orbit to an elliptical one; the satellite will descend and reach the lowest orbital point (the periapse) at 180 degrees away from the firing point; then it will ascend back. The period of the resultant orbit will be less than that of the original circular orbit. Thrust applied in the direction of the satellite&#x27;s motion creates an elliptical orbit with its highest point (apoapse) 180 degrees away from the firing point. The period of the resultant orbit will be longer than that of the original circular orbit.

The consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive. For example, if two spacecrafts are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock, unless they are very close, the trailing craft cannot simply fire its engines to go faster. This will change the shape of its orbit, causing it to gain altitude and actually slow down relative to the leading craft, missing the target. The space rendezvous before docking normally takes multiple precisely calculated engine firings in multiple orbital periods, requiring hours or even days to complete.

To the extent that the standard assumptions of astrodynamics do not hold, actual trajectories will vary from those calculated. For example, simple atmospheric drag is another complicating factor for objects in low Earth orbit.

These rules of thumb are decidedly inaccurate when describing two or more bodies of similar mass, such as a binary star system (see n-body problem). Celestial mechanics uses more general rules applicable to a wider variety of situations. Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, which can be mathematically derived from Newton&#x27;s laws, hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces; they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories. In the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important.

==Laws of astrodynamics==

The fundamental laws of astrodynamics are Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation and Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, while the fundamental mathematical tool is differential calculus.

In a Newtonian framework, the laws governing orbits and trajectories are in principle time-symmetric.

Standard assumptions in astrodynamics include non-interference from outside bodies, negligible mass for one of the bodies, and negligible other forces (such as from the solar wind, atmospheric drag, etc.). More accurate calculations can be made without these simplifying assumptions, but they are more complicated. The increased accuracy often does not make enough of a difference in the calculation to be worthwhile.

Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion may be derived from Newton&#x27;s laws, when it is assumed that the orbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor. When an engine thrust or propulsive force is present, Newton&#x27;s laws still apply, but Kepler&#x27;s laws are invalidated. When the thrust stops, the resulting orbit will be different but will once again be described by Kepler&#x27;s laws which have been set out above. The three laws are:
# The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the foci.
# A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
# The squares of the orbital periods of planets are directly proportional to the cubes of the semi-major axis of the orbits.

===Escape velocity===

The formula for an escape velocity is derived as follows. The specific energy (energy per unit mass) of any space vehicle is composed of two components, the specific potential energy and the specific kinetic energy. The specific potential energy associated with a planet of mass &quot;M&quot; is given by
:formula_1

where &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant and &quot;r&quot; is the distance between the two bodies;

while the specific kinetic energy of an object is given by
:formula_2

where &quot;v&quot; is its Velocity;

and so the total specific orbital energy is
:formula_3

Since energy is conserved, formula_4 cannot depend on the distance, formula_5, from the center of the central body to the space vehicle in question, i.e. &quot;v&quot; must vary with &quot;r&quot; to keep the specific orbital energy constant. Therefore, the object can reach infinite formula_5 only if this quantity is nonnegative, which implies
:formula_7

The escape velocity from the Earth&#x27;s surface is about 11 km/s, but that is insufficient to send the body an infinite distance because of the gravitational pull of the Sun. To escape the Solar System from a location at a distance from the Sun equal to the distance Sun–Earth, but not close to the Earth, requires around 42 km/s velocity, but there will be &quot;partial credit&quot; for the Earth&#x27;s orbital velocity for spacecraft launched from Earth, if their further acceleration (due to the propulsion system) carries them in the same direction as Earth travels in its orbit.

===Formulae for free orbits===
Orbits are conic sections, so the formula for the distance of a body for a given angle corresponds to the formula for that curve in polar coordinates, which is:
:formula_8
:formula_9
:formula_10

formula_11 is called the gravitational parameter. formula_12 and formula_13 are the masses of objects 1 and 2, and formula_14 is the specific angular momentum of object 2 with respect to object 1. The parameter formula_15 is known as the true anomaly, formula_16 is the semi-latus rectum, while formula_17 is the orbital eccentricity, all obtainable from the various forms of the six independent orbital elements.

===Circular orbits===

All bounded orbits where the gravity of a central body dominates are elliptical in nature. A special case of this is the circular orbit, which is an ellipse of zero eccentricity. The formula for the velocity of a body in a circular orbit at distance &quot;r&quot; from the center of gravity of mass &quot;M&quot; can be derived as follows:

Centrifugal acceleration matches the acceleration due to gravity.

So, formula_18

Therefore,
:formula_19

where formula_20 is the gravitational constant, equal to
:6.6743 × 10−11 m3/(kg·s2)

To properly use this formula, the units must be consistent; for example, formula_21 must be in kilograms, and formula_5 must be in meters. The answer will be in meters per second.

The quantity formula_23 is often termed the standard gravitational parameter, which has a different value for every planet or moon in the Solar System.

Once the circular orbital velocity is known, the escape velocity is easily found by multiplying by formula_24:
:formula_25

To escape from gravity, the kinetic energy must at least match the negative potential energy. Therefore, formula_26
:formula_27

===Elliptical orbits===
If formula_28, then the denominator of the equation of free orbits varies with the true anomaly formula_15, but remains positive, never becoming zero. Therefore, the relative position vector remains bounded, having its smallest magnitude at periapsis formula_30, which is given by:
:formula_31

The maximum value formula_5 is reached when formula_33. This point is called the apoapsis, and its radial coordinate, denoted formula_34, is
:formula_35

Let formula_36 be the distance measured along the apse line from periapsis formula_37 to apoapsis formula_38, as illustrated in the equation below:
:formula_39

Substituting the equations above, we get:
:formula_40

a is the semimajor axis of the ellipse. Solving for formula_16, and substituting the result in the conic section curve formula above, we get:
:formula_42

====Orbital period====
Under standard assumptions the orbital period (formula_43) of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed as:
:formula_44
where:
*formula_45 is the standard gravitational parameter,
*formula_46 is the length of the semi-major axis.
Conclusions:
*The orbital period is equal to that for a circular orbit with the orbit radius equal to the semi-major axis (formula_46),
*For a given semi-major axis the orbital period does not depend on the eccentricity (See also: Kepler&#x27;s third law).

====Velocity====
Under standard assumptions the orbital speed (formula_48) of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed from the Vis-viva equation as:
:formula_49
where:
*formula_45 is the standard gravitational parameter,
*formula_51 is the distance between the orbiting bodies.
*formula_46 is the length of the semi-major axis.

The velocity equation for a hyperbolic trajectory is formula_53.

====Energy====
Under standard assumptions, specific orbital energy (formula_54) of elliptic orbit is negative and the orbital energy conservation equation (the Vis-viva equation) for this orbit can take the form:
:formula_55
where:
*formula_48 is the speed of the orbiting body,
*formula_51 is the distance of the orbiting body from the center of mass of the central body,
*formula_58 is the semi-major axis,
*formula_45 is the standard gravitational parameter.
Conclusions:
*For a given semi-major axis the specific orbital energy is independent of the eccentricity.

Using the virial theorem we find:
*the time-average of the specific potential energy is equal to formula_60
*the time-average of formula_61 is formula_62
*the time-average of the specific kinetic energy is equal to formula_63

===Parabolic orbits===
If the eccentricity equals 1, then the orbit equation becomes:
:formula_64
where:
*formula_51 is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the mass center of the central body,
*formula_66 is specific angular momentum of the orbiting body,
*formula_67 is the true anomaly of the orbiting body,
*formula_45 is the standard gravitational parameter.

As the true anomaly θ approaches 180°, the denominator approaches zero, so that &quot;r&quot; tends towards infinity. Hence, the energy of the trajectory for which &quot;e&quot;=1 is zero, and is given by:
:formula_69
where:
*formula_48 is the speed of the orbiting body.

In other words, the speed anywhere on a parabolic path is:
:formula_71

===Hyperbolic orbits===
If formula_72, the orbit formula,
:formula_64

describes the geometry of the hyperbolic orbit. The system consists of two symmetric curves. The orbiting body occupies one of them; the other one is its empty mathematical image. Clearly, the denominator of the equation above goes to zero when formula_74. we denote this value of true anomaly
:formula_75
since the radial distance approaches infinity as the true anomaly approaches formula_76, known as the &quot;true anomaly of the asymptote&quot;. Observe that formula_76 lies between 90° and 180°. From the trigonometric identity formula_78 it follows that:
:formula_79

====Energy====
Under standard assumptions, specific orbital energy (formula_54) of a hyperbolic trajectory is greater than zero and the orbital energy conservation equation for this kind of trajectory takes form:
:formula_81
where:
*formula_48 is the orbital velocity of orbiting body,
*formula_51 is the radial distance of orbiting body from central body,
*formula_58 is the negative semi-major axis of the orbit&#x27;s hyperbola,
*formula_45 is standard gravitational parameter.

====Hyperbolic excess velocity====
Under standard assumptions the body traveling along a hyperbolic trajectory will attain at formula_86 infinity an orbital velocity called hyperbolic excess velocity (formula_87) that can be computed as:
:formula_88
where:
*formula_89 is standard gravitational parameter,
*formula_46 is the negative semi-major axis of orbit&#x27;s hyperbola.

The hyperbolic excess velocity is related to the specific orbital energy or characteristic energy by
:formula_91

==Calculating trajectories==

===Kepler&#x27;s equation===
One approach to calculating orbits (mainly used historically) is to use Kepler&#x27;s equation:
:formula_92.

where &quot;M&quot; is the mean anomaly, &quot;E&quot; is the eccentric anomaly, and formula_93 is the eccentricity.

With Kepler&#x27;s formula, finding the time-of-flight to reach an angle (true anomaly) of formula_15 from periapsis is broken into two steps:
# Compute the eccentric anomaly formula_95 from true anomaly formula_15
# Compute the time-of-flight formula_97 from the eccentric anomaly formula_95

Finding the eccentric anomaly at a given time (the inverse problem) is more difficult. Kepler&#x27;s equation is transcendental in formula_95, meaning it cannot be solved for formula_95 algebraically. Kepler&#x27;s equation can be solved for formula_95 analytically by inversion.

A solution of Kepler&#x27;s equation, valid for all real values of formula_102 is:

formula_103

Evaluating this yields:

formula_104

Alternatively, Kepler&#x27;s Equation can be solved numerically. First one must guess a value of formula_95 and solve for time-of-flight; then adjust formula_95 as necessary to bring the computed time-of-flight closer to the desired value until the required precision is achieved. Usually, Newton&#x27;s method is used to achieve relatively fast convergence.

The main difficulty with this approach is that it can take prohibitively long to converge for the extreme elliptical orbits. For near-parabolic orbits, eccentricity formula_107 is nearly 1, and substituting formula_108 into the formula for mean anomaly, formula_109, we find ourselves subtracting two nearly-equal values, and accuracy suffers. For near-circular orbits, it is hard to find the periapsis in the first place (and truly circular orbits have no periapsis at all). Furthermore, the equation was derived on the assumption of an elliptical orbit, and so it does not hold for parabolic or hyperbolic orbits. These difficulties are what led to the development of the universal variable formulation, described below.

===Conic orbits===
For simple procedures, such as computing the delta-v for coplanar transfer ellipses, traditional approaches are fairly effective. Others, such as time-of-flight are far more complicated, especially for near-circular and hyperbolic orbits.

===The patched conic approximation===

The Hohmann transfer orbit alone is a poor approximation for interplanetary trajectories because it neglects the planets&#x27; own gravity. Planetary gravity dominates the behavior of the spacecraft in the vicinity of a planet and in most cases Hohmann severely overestimates delta-v, and produces highly inaccurate prescriptions for burn timings. A relatively simple way to get a first-order approximation of delta-v is based on the &#x27;Patched Conic Approximation&#x27; technique. One must choose the one dominant gravitating body in each region of space through which the trajectory will pass, and to model only that body&#x27;s effects in that region. For instance, on a trajectory from the Earth to Mars, one would begin by considering only the Earth&#x27;s gravity until the trajectory reaches a distance where the Earth&#x27;s gravity no longer dominates that of the Sun. The spacecraft would be given escape velocity to send it on its way to interplanetary space. Next, one would consider only the Sun&#x27;s gravity until the trajectory reaches the neighborhood of Mars. During this stage, the transfer orbit model is appropriate. Finally, only Mars&#x27;s gravity is considered during the final portion of the trajectory where Mars&#x27;s gravity dominates the spacecraft&#x27;s behavior. The spacecraft would approach Mars on a hyperbolic orbit, and a final retrograde burn would slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by Mars. Friedrich Zander was one of the first to apply the patched-conics approach for astrodynamics purposes, when proposing the use of intermediary bodies&#x27; gravity for interplanetary travels, in what is known today as a gravity assist.

The size of the &quot;neighborhoods&quot; (or spheres of influence) vary with radius formula_110:
:formula_111
where formula_112 is the semimajor axis of the planet&#x27;s orbit relative to the Sun; formula_113 and formula_114 are the masses of the planet and Sun, respectively.

This simplification is sufficient to compute rough estimates of fuel requirements, and rough time-of-flight estimates, but it is not generally accurate enough to guide a spacecraft to its destination. For that, numerical methods are required.
===The universal variable formulation===
To address computational shortcomings of traditional approaches for solving the 2-body problem, the universal variable formulation was developed. It works equally well for the circular, elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic cases, the differential equations converging well when integrated for any orbit. It also generalizes well to problems incorporating perturbation theory.
===Perturbations===
The universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique, except now, instead of the six Keplerian orbital elements, we use a different set of orbital elements: namely, the satellite&#x27;s initial position and velocity vectors formula_115 and formula_116 at a given epoch formula_117. In a two-body simulation, these elements are sufficient to compute the satellite&#x27;s position and velocity at any time in the future, using the universal variable formulation. Conversely, at any moment in the satellite&#x27;s orbit, we can measure its position and velocity, and then use the universal variable approach to determine what its initial position and velocity &quot;would have been&quot; at the epoch. In perfect two-body motion, these orbital elements would be invariant (just like the Keplerian elements would be).

However, perturbations cause the orbital elements to change over time. Hence, the position element is written as formula_118 and the velocity element as formula_119, indicating that they vary with time. The technique to compute the effect of perturbations becomes one of finding expressions, either exact or approximate, for the functions formula_118 and formula_119.

The following are some effects which make real orbits differ from the simple models based on a spherical Earth. Most of them can be handled on short timescales (perhaps less than a few thousand orbits) by perturbation theory because they are small relative to the corresponding two-body effects.
*Equatorial bulges cause precession of the node and the perigee
*Tesseral harmonics of the gravity field introduce additional perturbations
*Lunar and solar gravity perturbations alter the orbits
*Atmospheric drag reduces the semi-major axis unless make-up thrust is used

Over very long timescales (perhaps millions of orbits), even small perturbations can dominate, and the behavior can become chaotic. On the other hand, the various perturbations can be orchestrated by clever astrodynamicists to assist with orbit maintenance tasks, such as station-keeping, ground track maintenance or adjustment, or phasing of perigee to cover selected targets at low altitude.

==Orbital maneuver==

In spaceflight, an orbital maneuver is the use of propulsion systems to change the orbit of a spacecraft. For spacecraft far from Earth—for example those in orbits around the Sun—an orbital maneuver is called a &quot;deep-space maneuver (DSM)&quot;.

===Orbital transfer===
Transfer orbits are usually elliptical orbits that allow spacecraft to move from one (usually substantially circular) orbit to another. Usually they require a burn at the start, a burn at the end, and sometimes one or more burns in the middle.
*The Hohmann transfer orbit requires a minimal delta-v.
*A bi-elliptic transfer can require less energy than the Hohmann transfer, if the ratio of orbits is 11.94 or greater, but comes at the cost of increased trip time over the Hohmann transfer.
*Faster transfers may use any orbit that intersects both the original and destination orbits, at the cost of higher delta-v.
*Using low thrust engines (such as electrical propulsion), if the initial orbit is supersynchronous to the final desired circular orbit then the optimal transfer orbit is achieved by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee. This method however takes much longer due to the low thrust.

For the case of orbital transfer between non-coplanar orbits, the change-of-plane thrust must be made at the point where the orbital planes intersect (the &quot;node&quot;). As the objective is to change the direction of the velocity vector by an angle equal to the angle between the planes, almost all of this thrust should be made when the spacecraft is at the node near the apoapse, when the magnitude of the velocity vector is at its lowest. However, a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse, by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change. This works because the cosine of a small angle is very nearly one, resulting in the small plane change being effectively &quot;free&quot; despite the high velocity of the spacecraft near periapse, as the Oberth Effect due to the increased, slightly angled thrust exceeds the cost of the thrust in the orbit-normal axis.

===Gravity assist and the Oberth effect===
In a gravity assist, a spacecraft swings by a planet and leaves in a different direction, at a different speed. This is useful to speed or slow a spacecraft instead of carrying more fuel.

This maneuver can be approximated by an elastic collision at large distances, though the flyby does not involve any physical contact. Due to Newton&#x27;s Third Law (equal and opposite reaction), any momentum gained by a spacecraft must be lost by the planet, or vice versa. However, because the planet is much, much more massive than the spacecraft, the effect on the planet&#x27;s orbit is negligible.

The Oberth effect can be employed, particularly during a gravity assist operation. This effect is that use of a propulsion system works better at high speeds, and hence course changes are best done when close to a gravitating body; this can multiply the effective delta-v.

===Interplanetary Transport Network and fuzzy orbits===
It is now possible to use computers to search for routes using the nonlinearities in the gravity of the planets and moons of the Solar System. For example, it is possible to plot an orbit from high Earth orbit to Mars, passing close to one of the Earth&#x27;s Trojan points. Collectively referred to as the Interplanetary Transport Network, these highly perturbative, even chaotic, orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the Lagrange point (in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections). The biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow, taking many years. In addition launch windows can be very far apart.

They have, however, been employed on projects such as Genesis. This spacecraft visited the Earth-Sun point and returned using very little propellant.

<doc id="182147" wikidata="Q176026" url="?curid=182147" title="Sidney Darlington">
<text>Sidney Darlington (July 18, 1906 – October 31, 1997) was an American electrical engineer and inventor of a transistor configuration in 1953, the Darlington pair. He advanced the state of network theory, developing the insertion-loss synthesis approach, invented chirp radar, and contributed to the designs of bombsights and gun and rocket guidance.

Darlington was awarded a B.S. in physics, magna cum laude, from Harvard in 1928, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He also received a B.S. in E.E. from MIT in 1929, and a Ph.D. in physics from Columbia in 1940.

In 1945, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States&#x27; highest civilian honor, for his contributions during World War II. He was an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering, which cited his contributions to electrical network theory, radar, and guidance systems. In 1975, he received IEEE&#x27;s Edison Medal &quot;For basic contributions to network theory and for important inventions in radar systems and electronic circuits&quot; and the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1981 &quot;For fundamental contributions to filtering and signal processing leading to chirp radar&quot;.

He died at his home in Exeter, New Hampshire, USA, at the age of 91.

<doc id="182153" wikidata="Q8098" url="?curid=182153" title="1904 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1904 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the III Olympiad and also known as St. Louis 1904) were an international multi-sport event held in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, from 1 July to 23 November 1904. Many events were conducted at what is now known as Francis Field on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis. This was the first time that the Olympic Games were held outside Europe.

Tensions caused by the Russo–Japanese War and difficulties in traveling to St. Louis resulted in very few top-class athletes from outside the United States and Canada taking part in the 1904 Games. Only 69–74 of the 651 athletes who competed came from outside North America, and only between 12 and 15 nations were represented in all. Some events subsequently combined the U.S. national championship with the Olympic championship. The current three-medal format of gold, silver and bronze for first, second and third place was introduced at the 1904 Olympics.

==Background==
Chicago, Illinois, initially won the bid to host the 1904 Summer Olympics, but the organizers of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis opposed the scheduling of another international event for the same time frame in a different city, perceiving such a prospect as a competitive threat that would divert potential attendees and the revenues that they would bring. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition&#x27;s organizers responded by developing plans for including large-scale international sports activities in their own event, informing the Chicago OCOG that unless the Olympics were moved to St. Louis, such that persons interested in both events could attend each, the Louisiana Purchase Expedition&#x27;s organizers would conduct and publicize competitions on a scale eclipsing that of the Olympics, retaining and attracting enough attendees and revenues that the Olympics&#x27; hosts and backers would not recoup their investment. Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympic movement, then intervened and awarded the Games to St. Louis.

==The Games==
===Highlights===
Boxing, dumbbells, catch wrestling (which later became freestyle wrestling), and the decathlon made their debuts. The swimming events were held in a temporary pond near Skinker and Wydown Boulevards, where &quot;lifesaving demonstrations&quot; of unsinkable lifeboats for ocean liners took place.

One of the most remarkable athletes was the American gymnast George Eyser, who won six medals even though his left leg was made of wood, and Frank Kugler won four medals in freestyle wrestling, weightlifting and tug of war, making him the only competitor to win a medal in three different sports at the same Olympic Games.

Chicago runner James Lightbody won the steeplechase and the 800 m and then set a natural world record in the 1500 m. Harry Hillman won both the 200 m and 400 m hurdles and also the flat 400 m. Sprinter Archie Hahn was champion in the 60 m, 100 m and 200 m. In this last race, he set an Olympic record in 21.6, a natural record that stood for 28 years. In the discus, after American Martin Sheridan had thrown exactly the same distance as his compatriot, Ralph Rose (39.28 m), the judges gave them both an extra throw to decide the winner. Sheridan won the decider and claimed the gold medal. Ray Ewry again won all three standing jumps.

The team representing Great Britain was awarded a total of two medals, both won by Irish athletes. The top non-U.S. athlete was Emil Rausch of Germany, who won three swimming events. Zoltán Halmay of Hungary and Charles Daniels of the United States each won two swimming gold medals. Galt Football Club from Canada won the gold medal in football.

===Anthropology Days===

The organizers of the World&#x27;s Fair held &quot;Anthropology Days&quot; on August 12 and 13. Since the 1889 Paris Exposition, human zoos, as a key feature of world&#x27;s fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, progress, and civilization. These goals were followed also at the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats. Another 1600 indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE), including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School, where American Indian boarding schools students demonstrated their successful assimilation. The sporting event itself took place with the participation of about 100 paid indigenous men (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included &quot;baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand&quot;. According to theorist Susan Brownell, world&#x27;s fairs – with their inclusion of human zoos – and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time, as they &quot;were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity&quot;. Also, one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.

==Sports==
The 1904 Summer Olympic program featured 16 sports encompassing 95 events in 18 disciplines. Swimming, diving and water polo are considered three disciplines of the same sport, &quot;aquatics&quot;. In July 2021 the IOC accepted the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon regarding which sports and events should be considered as Olympic. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.
===New sports===

Boxing made its Olympic debut at the St. Louis Games. The sport has since featured at every Summer Olympics, except for the 1912 Stockholm Games.

While wrestling made a return, it was exclusively the newly debuted catch wrestling (which later became freestyle wrestling) as opposed to Greco-Roman style of the 1896 Summer Olympics. Five nations were represented, with each of the 42 competitors having resided in the United States. Later editions would have both styles of wrestling in their programs.

===Demonstration sports===
Basketball, hurling, American football and Gaelic football were featured as unofficial sports. There was a demonstration bout of women&#x27;s boxing. Baseball is also noted by the World Baseball Softball Confederation to have appeared at the Games, though it does not appear in the list compiled by Olympic historian Bill Mallon and any results are not known.

==Venues==

Five sports venues were used for the 1904 Summer Olympics. The venues included Glen Echo Country Club, the first golf course constructed west of the Mississippi River, which had opened in 1901. Three Olympic sports were hosted at Forest Park, the site of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition which was being held concurrently with the Olympics: the Life Saving Exhibition Lake at Forest Park was used for the diving, swimming, and water polo events.

Creve Coeur Lake became the first park of St. Louis County in 1945. The Lake has hosted rowing regattas since 1882 and still hosts them as of 2010. Francis Olympic Field and Gymnasium are still in use on the Washington University in St. Louis campus as of 2021. An ornamental gate commemorating the 1904 Games was constructed outside the stadium immediately after the Exposition. A swimming pool was added to the gymnasium in 1985. Forest Park, constructed in 1876, is still in use as of 2021 and attracts over 12 million visitors annually. Glen Echo Country Club remains in use as a golf course today as of 2021.

==Participating nations==


Athletes from twelve nations competed in St. Louis. Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of known competitors for each nation. Due to the difficulty of getting to St. Louis in 1904, and European tensions caused by the Russo-Japanese War, only 69–74 athletes from outside North America participated in the Olympics.
===Disputed===
Some sources also list athletes from the following nations as having competed at these Games:
* Newfoundland Colony (1)

====Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees====
==Medal count==

These are the nations that won medals at the 1904 Games.


===Notes on medalists===
The nationalities of some medalists were disputed, as many American athletes were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted U.S. citizenship. In July 2021, the IOC accepted the recommendations of Olympic historian Bill Mallon, and adjusted their database with regard to the following cases:

* In 2009, historians from the International Society of Olympic Historians discovered that cyclist Frank Bizzoni, believed to be an American, was still an Italian citizen when he competed in 1904: he received U.S. citizenship in 1917.
* Two Norwegian-American wrestlers, Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen won gold medals. In 2012, Norwegian historians found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, while Hansen probably never received American citizenship. The historians therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians. In May 2013, it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in the IOC&#x27;s medal database, which was done.
* Swimmer and multi-medalist Francis Gailey competed in 1904 as an Australian. He immigrated to America in 1906, sailing to San Francisco on the SS Sonoma, and worked as a banker in California, living for a time in Ontario, Canada, where he married Mary Adams, and finally settled in southern California in 1918, managing orange-grove plantations.
* Multi-medalist Frank Kugler of Germany, a member of the St. Louis Southwest Turnverein team, was granted U.S. citizenship in 1913.
* Gustav Tiefenthaler was born in Switzerland, but the family moved to the United States when he was a child: he represented the South Broadway AC in St. Louis. At the Olympics, Tiefenthaler wrestled one bout and lost, but earned a bronze medal.
* French-American Albert Corey won silver medals in the marathon, and in the team race as part of a mixed team (together with four undisputed Americans).
* Austrian-American gymnast Julius Lenhart won gold and silver medals in individual events and gold medal in team competition as a part of the mixed team.

The IOC also counted one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals won by the American fencer Albertson Van Zo Post for Cuba instead of the United States: the IOC also showed Charles Tatham as Cuban for individual fencing events and American for the team event, but he was an American.

<text>Doctor John Dolittle is the central character of a series of children&#x27;s books by Hugh Lofting starting with the 1920 &quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle&quot;. He is a physician who shuns human patients in favour of animals, with whom he can speak in their own languages. He later becomes a naturalist, using his abilities to speak with animals to better understand nature and the history of the world.

Doctor Dolittle first appeared in the author&#x27;s illustrated letters to his children, written from the trenches during World War I when actual news, he later said, was either too horrible or too dull. The stories are set in early Victorian England, where Doctor John Dolittle lives in the fictional English village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh in the West Country.

Doctor Dolittle has a few close human friends, including his young assistant Tommy Stubbins, and Matthew Mugg, the Cats&#x27;-Meat Man. The animal team includes Polynesia (a parrot), Gub-Gub (a pig), Jip (a dog), Dab-Dab (a duck), Chee-Chee (a monkey), Too-Too (an owl), the Pushmi-pullyu, and a white mouse later named simply &quot;Whitey&quot;. Later on, in the 1925 novel &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Zoo&quot;, Whitey founds (with the doctor&#x27;s help) the &quot;Rat and Mouse Club&quot;, whose membership eventually reaches some 5,000 rats and mice.

==Inspiration==
One inspiration for his character appears to be the Scottish surgeon John Hunter.

==Stories==

&quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle: Being the History of His Peculiar Life at Home and Astonishing Adventures in Foreign Parts Never Before Printed&quot; (1920) begins the series. The sequel &quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1922) won the prestigious Newbery Medal. The next three, &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Post Office&quot; (1923), &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Circus&quot; (1924), and &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Caravan&quot; (1926) take place during and/or after the events of &quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle&quot;. Five more novels followed, and after Lofting&#x27;s death in 1947, two more volumes of short, previously unpublished pieces appeared.

The stories, in order of publication, are:

#&quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1920)
#&quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1922)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Post Office&quot; (1923)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Circus&quot; (1924)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle Meets a Londoner in Paris&quot; (1925)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Zoo&quot; (1925)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Caravan&quot; (1926)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1927)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle in the Moon&quot; (1928)
#&quot;Gub Gub&#x27;s Book: An Encyclopaedia of Food&quot; (1932)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Return&quot; (1933)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Birthday Book&quot; (1936)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle and the Secret Lake&quot; (copyrighted 1923, but not published until 1948)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary&quot; (1950)
#&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Puddleby Adventures&quot; (1952)
#*&quot;The Sea Dog&quot;
#*&quot;Dapple&quot;
#*&quot;The Dog Ambulance&quot;
#*&quot;The Stunned Man&quot;
#*&quot;The Crested Screamers&quot;
#*&quot;The Green Breasted Martins&quot;
#*&quot;The Story of the Maggot&quot;
#*&quot;The Lost Boy&quot;

&quot;Gub Gub&#x27;s Book: An Encyclopaedia of Food&quot; (1932) is purportedly written by the pig Gub-Gub. It is a series of food-themed animal vignettes. In the text, the pretence of Gub-Gub&#x27;s authorship is dropped; Tommy Stubbins, Dr. Dolittle&#x27;s assistant, explains that he is reporting a series of Gub-Gub&#x27;s discourses to the other animals of the Dolittle household around the evening fire. Stubbins also says that the full version of Gub-Gub&#x27;s encyclopaedia, which was an immense and poorly-organized collection of scribblings written by the pig in a language for pigs invented by Dr. Dolittle, was too long to translate into English.

&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Birthday Book&quot; (1936) is a little day-book illustrated with pictures and quotations from the earlier stories. It appeared between &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Return&quot; and &quot;Doctor Dolittle and the Secret Lake&quot;.

&quot;Doctor Dolittle Meets a Londoner in Paris&quot; is a short story included in &quot;The Flying Carpet&quot;, pp. 110–19 (1925), an anthology of children&#x27;s short stories and poems with illustrations by Cynthia Asquith.

The character entered public domain in the 1990s, which allowed for the legal creation of derivative works based on it without the need to acquire permission from the Lofting estate, which was required previously. For example, in April 2021, the Japanese biologist Shinichi Fukuoka created a new story &quot;Dr. Dolittle Saves Galápagos Islands&quot; which appeared in The Asahi Shimbun.

== Chronology ==
The main events of &quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle&quot; take place in 1819 or 1820, although the events of the early chapters seem to be spread over several years. &quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; begins in 1839.

Dolittle returned from his journey to the moon in &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s return&quot; during a full lunar eclipse that was visible low in the sky one late evening in spring. This was the first full lunar eclipse for a couple of years, and it took place in May 1844 in real life.

Backstory references indicate that Dr. Dolittle travelled to the North Pole in April 1809, and already knew how to speak to some species of animals at that date, suggesting that the early chapters of &quot;The Story of Doctor Dolittle&quot; take place before that date. However, it is possible that the internal chronology is not consistent.

The internal chronology of the books is somewhat different from the publishing order. The first book is followed by &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Circus&quot; (1924), &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Caravan&quot; (1926), and &quot;Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary&quot; (1950). Only then follows the second book, &quot;The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1922), continued by &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Zoo&quot; (1925). After that, the publishing order is restored; &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1927) is followed by &quot;Doctor Dolittle in the Moon&quot; (1928) and &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Return&quot; (1933), ending with &quot;Doctor Dolittle and the Secret Lake&quot; (1948).

&quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Post Office&quot; (1923) can&#x27;t be placed anywhere in the internal chronology without creating contradictions. &quot;Doctor Dolittle&#x27;s Circus&quot; contains references to events that occurred in &quot;Post Office&quot;, indicating that &quot;Post Office&quot; must precede &quot;Circus&quot;. But the Prologue of &quot;Post Office&quot; indicates just as definitely that it must happen sometime after &quot;Circus&quot;. Furthermore, in the narrative sequence that stretches from the end of the first book, through &quot;Circus&quot; and &quot;Caravan&quot;, to &quot;Green Canary&quot;, there&#x27;s no gap into which &quot;Post Office&quot; could be inserted. For the sake of a reading order, the most logical options are to place &quot;Post Office&quot; immediately before &quot;Circus&quot;, or immediately after &quot;Green Canary&quot;.

The stories, in order of internal chronology, are:

==Appearances in other languages==
A Russian children&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Aybolit&quot; (Doctor Oh-it-hurts) by Korney Chukovsky (first published in 1924) was loosely based on the stories of Doctor Dolittle. The original novel credited Lofting&#x27;s work, as did Chukovsky in his memoirs.

Norwegian playwright, songwriter, and illustrator Thorbjørn Egner made an album called &quot;Doktor Dyregod&quot; (Doctor good-toward-animals) with songs and story based on Doctor Dolittle.

All the books in the series have been translated into Japanese by Masuji Ibuse and into Lithuanian by Pranas Mašiotas.

<text>Gaius Caesar (20 BC – 21 February 4 AD) was a grandson and heir to the throne of Roman emperor Augustus, alongside his younger brother Lucius Caesar. Although he was born to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia, Augustus&#x27; only daughter, Gaius and Lucius were raised by their grandfather as his adopted sons and joint-heirs. He experienced an accelerated political career befitting a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, with the Roman Senate allowing him to advance his career without first holding a quaestorship or praetorship, offices that ordinary senators were required to hold as part of the &quot;cursus honorum&quot;.

In 1 BC, Gaius was given command of the eastern provinces, after which he concluded a peace treaty with King Phraates V of Parthia on an island in the Euphrates. Shortly afterwards, he was appointed to the office of consul for the following year, 1 AD. The year after Gaius&#x27; consulship, Lucius died at Massilia in the month of August. Approximately eighteen months later, Gaius died of an illness in Lycia. He was married to his second cousin Livilla but they did not have children. In 4 AD, following the deaths of Gaius and Lucius, Augustus adopted his stepson, Tiberius, as well as his sole-surviving grandson, Agrippa Postumus.

== Background ==

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was an early supporter of Augustus (then &quot;Octavius&quot;) during the Final War of the Roman Republic that ensued as a result of the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC. He was a key general in Augustus&#x27; armies, commanding troops in pivotal battles against Mark Antony and Sextus Pompeius. From early on, Agrippa was trusted to handle affairs in the eastern provinces and was even given the signet ring of Augustus, who was seemingly on his deathbed in 23 BC, a sign that he would become &quot;princeps&quot; were Augustus to die. However, as soon as he recovered, Augustus began to show he favored his nephew, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, then just 19. However, Marcellus died of an illness that had spread throughout the city of Rome that year.

With Marcellus gone, Augustus arranged for the marriage of Agrippa to his daughter Julia the Elder, who was previously the wife of Marcellus. Agrippa was given &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; (&quot;the tribunician power&quot;) in 18 BC, a power that Augustus received in 23 BC, and later on was exercised only by the emperor and shared with some heirs (Agrippa, Tiberius). The tribunician power allowed him to control the Senate. Agrippa acted as tribune in the Senate to pass important legislation and, though he lacked some of the emperor&#x27;s power and authority, he was approaching the position of co-regent.

== Early life and family ==

Gaius was born in Rome in 20BC to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder. He was a part of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and was related to all the Julio-Claudian emperors. On his mother&#x27;s side, he was the oldest grandson of emperor Augustus. He was the stepson of Tiberius by his mother Julia&#x27;s marriage to him, and brother in law of Claudius by his sister Agrippina the Elder&#x27;s marriage to Germanicus. He also was the uncle of Caligula, who was the son of his sister Agrippina. The last emperor of the dynasty was Nero, who was Gaius&#x27; great-nephew and the grandson of Germanicus. An annual sacrifice on his birthday was granted in a decree.

In 17BC, his brother Lucius was born. Augustus immediately adopted both Gaius and Lucius from their father by a symbolic sale, and named both Gaius and Lucius his (personal) heirs. It is unknown what their father thought of the adoption. Their adoptive father initiated them into administrative life when they were still young, and sent them to the provinces as consuls-elect. Augustus taught Gaius and Lucius how to read, swim, and the other elements of education, taking special pains to train them to imitate his own handwriting, mostly by himself. Shortly after their adoption in the summer, Augustus held the fifth-ever &quot;Ludi Saeculares&quot; (&quot;Secular Games&quot;). The adoption of the boys coupled with the games served to introduce a new era of peace – the &quot;Pax Augusta&quot;.
That year his family left for the province of Syria, because Agrippa was given command of the eastern provinces with proconsular &quot;imperium maius&quot;. Four years later, in 13BC, Gaius took part in the Trojan games with the other patrician youths at the dedication of the Theatre of Marcellus. Also in 13BC, Agrippa and Augustus returned to Rome. Augustus sent Agrippa to Pannonia at the end of 13 to suppress a rebellion. Agrippa arrived there that winter (in 12BC), but the Pannonians gave up their plans. Agrippa returned to Campania in Italy, where he fell ill and died soon after. The death of Gaius&#x27; father made succession a pressing issue. The &quot;aurei&quot; and &quot;denarii&quot; issued in 13–12BC made clear the Emperor&#x27;s dynastic plans for Gaius and Lucius.

The luxurious rural villa-estate at Ossaia near Cortona was owned by Gaius and Lucius Caesar.

Their father was no longer available to assume the reins of power if the Emperor were to die, and Augustus had to make it clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen. To learn about military affairs, he accompanied Tiberius in his campaign against the Sicambri in 8BC. The year before, Tiberius&#x27; brother Drusus the Elder died on his way back from a campaign across the Rhine. Tiberius was given command of Germania, and waged two campaigns across the Rhine in 8BC and 7BC. He marched his army between the Elbe and the Rhine, and met little resistance, except from the Sicambri. Tiberius came close to exterminating the Sicambri, and had those who survived transported to the Roman side of the Rhine, where they could be watched more closely.

== Career ==

=== Early political career ===

Gaius was elected consul &quot;designatus&quot; by the &quot;Comitia Centuriata&quot; in 6BC with the intention that he should assume the consulship in his twentieth year. The next year, Augustus made him a &quot;pontifex&quot;, and granted him the right to attend Senate meetings, behold spectacles, and to be present at banquets with senators. Roman support for the young prince soon spread through Italy; statues and inscriptions were set up in every district to commemorate the fact that he had been nominated as a consul at an unprecedented age of fourteen.

The following year (5BC), when he attained military age, he assumed the &quot;toga virilis&quot;, and was introduced by Augustus to the Senate, who declared him as &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot; (&quot;leader of the youth&quot;) and &quot;sevir turmae&quot; (commander of a cavalry division). Having been designated consul, he was allowed to give his opinion to the senate. Lucius, three years his junior, was granted the same honours after the appropriate interval had elapsed.

=== Herodian succession ===

Following the death of King Herod of Judaea in 4BC, his sons Antipas and Archelaus both came to Rome with their own copy of Herod&#x27;s will to plead their case as to why they each deserved to inherit their father&#x27;s kingdom. Augustus, as usual, declined the sole responsibility of the decision. He convened a council of senators, among whom he included Gaius. The council decided to ratify the will brought by Archelaus, which included a large bequest to Augustus and his wife Livia. The cities of Judaea rose in revolt after the &quot;procurator&quot;, Sabinus, garrisoned Syria Palaestina to guard the tens of millions of sesterces promised to the Emperor. The governor of Syria, Varus, was forced to bring in the legions from Syria to restore order.

At the same time, King Phraates IV of Parthia had seized Armenia with the help of Armenian nationalists, and expelled Tigranes IV, the king installed by Rome. Historian Ferrero speculates that Phraates may have been hoping to use Armenia as a bargaining chip to secure the release of his sons who were held captive by the Romans. Roman supremacy in Asia depended on its possession of Armenia as a protectorate. Before Rome could deal with the Parthians in Armenia, it would first need to make its Syrian legions available, which were still tied down in Palestine. In order to free up the legions there, the Kingdom of Judaea was divided among the sons of Herod the Great. One half remained under Archelaus, while the other half was subdivided between his brothers, Antipas and Philip. This served to restore stability to the region, whilst keeping Judaea from becoming powerful. Having settled matters in Judaea, the Emperor decided to deploy an army to Armenia to re-establish its status as a Roman protectorate and to show the eastern world that Rome held dominion over all land as far as the Euphrates.

=== Command in Asia ===

==== Departure ====

Due to his advanced age, Augustus was unable to travel to the east himself. There were few to whom the Emperor could entrust matters in the east, but he was confident in Gaius. Gaius made a good choice because his presence represented that of the imperial family – all orders, promises, or threats coming from him were as valid as if they came from the Emperor himself. Nonetheless, he was only eighteen, and therefore too young for the conduct of important business.

Before leaving for the east, he and his brother Lucius were given the authority to consecrate buildings, and they did, with their management of the games held to celebrate the dedication of the Temple of Mars Ultor (1 August 2BC). His youngest brother, Postumus, participated in the Trojan game with the rest of the equestrian youth. 260 lions were slaughtered in the Circus Maximus, there was gladiatorial combat, a naval battle between the &quot;Persians&quot; and the &quot;Athenians&quot;, and 36 crocodiles were slaughtered in the Circus Flaminius.

Friends of Augustus had hoped that he would abandon his plan of sending Gaius to the east but, faced with increasing troubles there, he persisted with the plan and dispatched Gaius to Syria at the beginning of 1BC. The Emperor entrusted Gaius with proconsular authority and had him marry his second cousin Livilla, the daughter of Drusus the Elder and Antonia Minor.

Due to Gaius&#x27; youth and inexperience, the Emperor had advisors go with him. Among his entourage to the east were: Marcus Lollius as &quot;adiutor&quot; (&quot;helper&quot;), Publius Sulpicius Quirinus as &quot;rector&quot; (&quot;guide&quot;), the future historian Velleius Paterculus, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (grandfather of Nero), Juba II of Numidia, and future praetorian prefect Sejanus.

On his way to Syria, Gaius met with Tiberius, who had abandoned politics and retired to Rhodes. According to Suetonius, Gaius gave Tiberius a cold reception on the isle of Samos. Tiberius was alienated at the meeting, by the behaviour of both Lollius and Gaius&#x27; centurions. Suetonius further wrote that Tiberius wrote to the Emperor that Lollius should be replaced. Lollius&#x27; rivalry with Tiberius continued even after Gaius and his entourage reached Syria. Lollius strove to turn Gaius against Tiberius; Gaius, in any case, had no affection for the man who had contributed, directly or indirectly, to the ruin of his mother. On one occasion, Lollius offered to decapitate Tiberius if Gaius gave the word. Suetonius wrote that it was Lollius&#x27; growing influence that compelled Tiberius to plead with Augustus for his return to Rome.

====Consulship====

The next year, on 1 January, he entered the consulship &quot;in absentia&quot; with his brother-in-law, Lucius Aemilius Paullus, in accordance with the decision of 6BC which named him consul designate. Gaius, who was twenty, had reached Asia, and was probably at Antioch at the time his consulship commenced, where he was organizing an army for the invasion of Armenia and opening negotiations with Phraates in the hopes of securing an agreement. The Emperor did not desire an open war, and the king of Parthia seemed open to peace. Negotiations were probably hastened by the presence of Gaius&#x27; army in Syria, which threatened Parthia. From every corner, the young consul was visited by envoys offering requests and paying homage. This year, monuments were raised to him and to his brother as the son of Ares or as Ares himself.

His inexperience meant he was forced to rely on his companions, namely the unruly Lollius, who had taken advantage of the powers he held, and was reportedly holding towns, individuals, and even sovereign princes for ransom. After Gaius opened negotiations with Phraates, Lollius offered the Parthian king certain concessions in return for money.

Preparations for the war continued into the spring and summer of 1AD, at which point there had been a successful breakthrough in negotiations. As Phraates was not willing to go to war, he agreed to evacuate Armenia and abandon his brothers who were still in Roman captivity. In the second half of the year, Gaius had advanced with his army to the Parthian frontier to an unknown spot and brought Phraates to a final agreement on the proposals, in which he renounced all claims to Armenia and all power over his half-brothers.

It was about this time that Augustus passed through Judea and commended Gaius for not offering prayers at Jerusalem, as it would have been provocative to the Jews living there.

====Expedition in Arabia====
Sometime in the course of his time in the east, Gaius led an expedition into Arabia. Exactly where and for what purpose remains uncertain, though Pliny mentioned it in connection with Aelius Gallus&#x27; exploits in South Arabia. The term &quot;Arabia&quot; is never defined, and the term was used loosely by Roman sources. Various reasons, such as an attempt by Rome to control the incense trade, have been suggested but never proven. Juba II, former king of Mauretania, accompanied Gaius to the east. In order to prepare Gaius for his encounter with the Arabs, Juba wrote him a treatise. According to Pliny, the young prince made it as far as the Gulf of Aqaba. It is certain that this expedition happened before his time in Armenia, and, referencing Gaius&#x27; cenotaph in Pisa, it is almost certain to have taken place during his consulship.

Author and historian John Grainger places Gaius at the Gulf of Aqaba, or in Nabataea. It is known that the Nabataean Kingdom later became the province of Arabia, and so, it might be that Gaius conducted his &quot;Arabian expedition&quot; to either support or to discipline the King of Nabataea, Aretas IV. This is probably evidenced by the continuation of coinage in the king&#x27;s name after Gaius&#x27; consulship.

Cassius Dio, in a fragmentary notice, mentions trouble in Egypt which was suppressed by a tribune of the Praetorian Guard. It is very likely this man was part of Gaius&#x27; entourage, but other than that nothing is known of him.

====Supremacy in Armenia====

In the year following his consulship, in spring, he had held a meeting with Phraates on the bank of the Euphrates, in which a banquet was held to celebrate a peace treaty. It was here that Phraates, offended by Lollius, disclosed the guardian&#x27;s secret negotiations to Gaius. It was for the crime of extorting presents from kings (&quot;regnum muneribus&quot;) that Lollius lost the friendship of Gaius and drank poison. Pliny says he amassed a fortune from his crimes and that, as a result, his granddaughter could afford to wear jewelry worth 40,000,000 sesterces, a considerable amount of money. The death of Lollius was fortunate to Tiberius, after which Gaius consented to his return to Rome and consequent return to Roman politics.

At the same time, the throne of Armenia had become vacant and, with permission from the Emperor, Gaius placed Ariobarzanes II of Atropatene on the throne. The Romans weren&#x27;t the only ones interested in Armenia: the Parthians stirred up a revolt among nationalists in the nation. A large force of rebels had occupied the fortress in the city of Artagira. Gaius was drawn into the conflict, and invaded Armenia in late August of 2 AD. He encountered no serious opposition as there were only a few revolts he had to suppress as a result of the nationalist party.

On 9 September, Abbadon, the leader of the rebellion, invited Gaius into the fortress to speak with him. It proved to be a trick, and Gaius was wounded in the confrontation. He had to be carried away by his outraged lieutenants. His forces promptly laid siege to the city and captured the fortress after intense fighting. At first the wound did not seem serious and he was able to complete the pacification of Armenia, a relatively easy task.

By the next year, 3AD, he was entirely prostrated by the effects of his wound, had resigned his command, and withdrawn to Syria from where he informed Augustus that he had no further desire to take part in public life. The eastern campaign had proven severe: his health was weak and his mental balance unstable. At the age of twenty-three, the young man whom the Emperor considered his heir and sole hope of prosperity had abandoned his prospects of reputation and power in a wild fit of despair and fear. Augustus did his best to cheer him up and convince him to return to Italy. It was in vain; Gaius died in Limyra on 21 February 4AD.

==Post mortem==

While Gaius was in Armenia, his brother Lucius had been sent by Augustus to complete his military training in Spain. While there, he fell ill and died on 20 August 2AD in Massalia, Gaul. In the span of 18 months, the planned future of Rome was shaken. The deaths of both Gaius and Lucius, the Emperor&#x27;s two most favoured heirs, led Augustus to adopt his stepson Tiberius and his sole remaining grandson Postumus as his new heirs on 26 June 4AD.
Many honors were heaped upon Gaius by citizens and city officials of the Empire, including &quot;Colonia Obsequens Iulia Pisana&quot; (Pisa), where it was decreed that proper rites must be observed by matrons to lament his passing. Temples, public baths, and shops shut their doors as women wept inconsolably. To commemorate his brief life, a cenotaph was erected on the Limyrus River at Limyra in Lycia. Posthumously, the Senate voted honours for the young Caesars, and arranged for the golden spears and shields the boys had received on achieving the age of military service to be hung in the Senate House. The caskets containing their ashes were stored in the Mausoleum of Augustus alongside those of their father Agrippa and other members of the imperial family.

Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio suggested foul play may have been involved in the death of Gaius and Lucius and that Gaius&#x27;s step grandmother Livia may have had a hand in their deaths. Livia&#x27;s presumed motive may have been to orchestrate the accession of her own son Tiberius as heir to Augustus.
==In popular culture==
* Gaius and Lucius both appeared as characters in the 1976 TV series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;; the series reverses the order of their deaths, with Gaius dying first. Gaius was played by Earl Rhodes.

<doc id="182164" wikidata="Q274520" url="?curid=182164" title="Grave of the Fireflies">
<text>is a 1988 Japanese animated historical war drama film written and directed by Isao Takahata, and produced by Studio Ghibli. It is based on the 1967 semi-autobiographical short story of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka. Set in the city of Kobe, Japan, it tells the story of siblings and war orphans Seita and Setsuko, and their desperate struggle to survive during the final months of the Pacific War.

The film stars Tsutomu Tatsumi, , and . The film was theatrically released on April 16, 1988. Universally acclaimed, &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; has been ranked as one of the greatest war films of all time and is recognized as a major work of Japanese animation. It has gained particular praise for its emotional impact.

==Plot==
In March 1945, American bombers destroy most of Kobe during the waning days of the Pacific War. Children of an Imperial Japanese Navy captain, Seita and his sister Setsuko, survive, but their mother dies. Seita conceals their mother&#x27;s death from Setsuko. The siblings move in with a distant aunt, and Seita retrieves supplies he buried before the bombing and gives everything to his aunt, save for a tin of Sakuma drops, which he gives to Setsuko. The aunt convinces Seita to sell his mother&#x27;s silk kimonos for rice, which devastates Setsuko.

As rations shrink, the aunt becomes resentful of the children as Seita does nothing to earn the food she prepares for them. At her suggestion, Seita withdraws some money from his mother&#x27;s bank account to buy a charcoal stove and other supplies. Following an air raid, the siblings move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They capture fireflies from the marshes and release them into the refuge for light. The following morning the fireflies have died. Setsuko buries them and reveals their aunt told her their mother died, then tearfully asks why the fireflies had to die so soon.

Things become grim when they run out of rice and a friendly farmer insists that Seita swallow his pride and return to their aunt as they can&#x27;t survive alone. Seita steals crops from farms and breaks into people&#x27;s homes during air raids. A farmer catches and beats him, but a police officer sympathizes with Seita as he is only stealing to feed Setsuko.

Setsuko falls ill, and a doctor explains she is suffering malnutrition. Seita withdraws the last of the money from their mother&#x27;s bank account. He is distraught to learn that Japan has surrendered and that his father is most likely dead, as most of Japan&#x27;s naval fleet have been sunk. Seita returns to Setsuko with food and finds her hallucinating. She dies as Seita finishes preparing the food. Seita cremates Setsuko&#x27;s body and her doll in a straw casket. He carries her ashes in the candy tin along with his father&#x27;s photograph.

Seita dies of starvation a few weeks later at a Sannomiya train station surrounded by other malnourished people. A janitor, tasked with removing the bodies before the Americans&#x27; arrival, sorts through Seita&#x27;s possessions. He finds the candy tin and throws it into a field. Setsuko&#x27;s ashes spread out, and her spirit springs from the container and is joined by Seita&#x27;s spirit and a cloud of fireflies. The two board a ghostly train and, throughout the journey, look back at the events leading to Seita&#x27;s death as silent, passive observers. Their spirits arrive at their destination: a hilltop bench overlooking present-day Kobe, surrounded by fireflies, healthy and content.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; author Akiyuki Nosaka said that many offers had been made to make a live-action film adaptation of his short story. Nosaka argued that &quot;it was impossible to create the barren, scorched earth that&#x27;s to be the backdrop of the story&quot;. He also argued that contemporary children would not be able to convincingly play the characters. Nosaka expressed surprise when an animated version was offered. After seeing the storyboards, Nosaka concluded that it was not possible for such a story to have been made in any method other than animation and expressed surprise in how accurately the rice paddies and townscape were depicted.

Isao Takahata said that he was compelled to film the short story after seeing how the main character, Seita, &quot;was a unique wartime ninth grader&quot;. Takahata explained that any wartime story, whether animated or not animated, &quot;tends to be moving and tear-jerking&quot;, and that young people develop an &quot;inferiority complex&quot; where they perceive people in wartime eras as being more noble and more able than they are, and therefore the audience believes that the story has nothing to do with them. Takahata argued that he wanted to dispel this mindset. When Nosaka asked if the film characters were &quot;having fun&quot;, Takahata answered that he clearly depicted Seita and Setsuko had &quot;substantial&quot; days and that they were &quot;&quot;enjoying&quot; their days&quot;. Takahata said that Setsuko was even more difficult to animate than Seita, and that he had never before depicted a girl younger than five. Takahata said that &quot;In that respect, when you make the book into a movie, Setsuko becomes a tangible person&quot;, and that four-year-olds often become more assertive and self-centered, and try to get their own ways during that age. He explained that while one could &quot;have a scene where Seita can&#x27;t stand that anymore&quot;, it is &quot;difficult to incorporate into a story&quot;. Takahata explained that the film is from Seita&#x27;s point of view, &quot;and even objective passages are filtered through his feelings&quot;.

Takahata said that he had considered using non-traditional animation methods, but because &quot;the schedule was planned and the movie&#x27;s release date set, and the staff assembled, it was apparent there was no room for such a trial-and-error approach&quot;. He further remarked that he had difficulty animating the scenery since, in Japanese animation, one is &quot;not allowed&quot; to depict Japan in a realistic manner. Animators often traveled to foreign countries to do research on how to depict them, but such research had not been done before for a Japanese setting. While animating the movie, Takahata also created several different cuts of the scene in which Seita cremates Setsuko&#x27;s body. Takahata spent a lot of time on this scene, trying to create the perfect iteration of it. Each of these cuts remained unfinished and unused in the end.

Most of the illustration outlines in the film are in brown, instead of the customary black. Black outlines were only used when it was absolutely necessary. Color coordinator Michiyo Yasuda said this was done to give the film a softer feel. Yasuda said that this technique had never been used in an anime before &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;, &quot;and it was done on a challenge&quot;. Yasuda explained that brown is more difficult to use than black because it does not contrast as well as black.

&quot;Grave of the&quot; &quot;Fireflies&quot; was Takahata&#x27;s first animated film produced with Studio Ghibli.

Takahata insisted on working with well known animators Yoshifumi Kondō who was working for Nippon Animation at the time and Yoshiyuki Momose. Both animators played a pivotal role in creating fluid, realistic animations of the characters in the animation.

Takahata drew from his personal experience to create a realistic depiction of the air raid on Okayama. In an interview, he criticized TV shows and movies that had recreated images of incendiary bombs, &quot;They include no sparks or explosions, I was there and I experienced it, so I know what it was like.&quot;

The film features Niteko-ike pond (ニテコ池), which is described as the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the novel and where Nosaka conducted his daily routines of dishwashing and personal ablutions. Notably, during the final days of the Pacific War, Nosaka, then 14 years old, sought refuge with his younger sister-in-law in a relative&#x27;s house and nearby bomb shelters near the pond.

The location and background in the film is based on a style created by 18th century Japanese artist Hiroshige and his follower Hergé, who created Tintin. Film critic Roger Ebert examines the contrast of the style of the background in comparison to the cartoonish animation of the characters. He claims that there is an unusual amount of detail in the evocative landscape, while the characters are a take on the modern Japanese animation style, with childlike bodies and enormous eyes. Ebert believed that this deliberate animation style embodies the true purpose of animation, which is to recreate the raw emotion of human life by simplifying reality to emphasize ideas. He concludes his analysis with saying, &quot;Yes, it&#x27;s a cartoon, and the kids have eyes like saucers, but it belongs on any list of the greatest war films ever made.&quot; According to Wendy Goldberg, Takahata&#x27;s film also includes criticism of the emphasis on nationalism in Japan. In a particular scene, Seita&#x27;s desire to join his father reflects a &quot;national fantasy of war&quot;, which leads him to neglect his sister.

===Music===
The music for the film was composed by Michio Mamiya. The theme song, &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;, was performed by coloratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci. Dialogue of the film is part of the soundtrack as the music and dialogue are not separated in any way. Mamiya is also a music specialist in baroque and classical music.

During an interview about his music, Mamiya stated that he creates his music to encourage peace. The songs in &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; as well as other pieces by Michio Mamiya, such as &quot;Serenade No. 3 &quot;Germ&quot;&quot;, express this theme.

The soundtrack album titled was first released on April 5, 1997, by Studio Ghilbi Records and and later released on June 25, 1988, by &quot;Animage.
The soundtrack does not contain standalone music and instead features both dialogue and music as they appear in the film.

Another soundtrack album titled was first released on April 5, 1997, by Studio Ghilbi Records and Tokuma Japan Communications, and later released on November 25, 1987, by &quot;Animage&quot;.

==Themes and analysis==
In his book about the film, Alex Dudok de Wit called &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; an &quot;unusually personal adaptation&quot; of Nosaka&#x27;s short story as Takahata had similar experiences during the war, though noted it deviated significantly in its portrayal of the children as ghosts in its opening sequence whereas the short story began immediately with the children losing their mother during the air raid.

Some critics in the West have viewed &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; as an anti-war film due to the graphic and emotional depiction of the pernicious repercussions of war on a society, and the individuals therein. The film focuses its attention almost entirely on the personal tragedies that war gives rise to, rather than seeking to glamorize it as a heroic struggle between competing nations. It emphasizes that war is society&#x27;s failure to perform its most important duty: to protect its own people.

However, Takahata repeatedly denied that the film was an anti-war film. In his own words, it &quot;is not at all an anti-war anime and contains absolutely no such message&quot;. Instead, Takahata had intended to convey an image of the brother and sister living a failed life due to isolation from society and invoke sympathy particularly in people in their teens and twenties. Takahata also describes Japan at that time as &quot;repressive&quot;, a time when &quot;totalitarianism at its lowest&quot; was endorsed in social life. He said &quot;Seita defies such totalitarianism and tries to build a &#x27;pure family&#x27; with Setsuko alone. Is such a thing possible? No, it is not possible, so he lets Setsuko die.[...] But can we criticize him? The reason why we modern people can easily sympathize with Seita emotionally is because the times have reversed. If the times are reversed again someday, the time may come when many people have more opinions to denounce Seita than that widow. I find it frightening.&quot;

Since the film gives little context to the war, Takahata feared a politician could just as easily claim fighting is needed to avoid such tragedies. In general, he was skeptical that depictions of suffering in similar works, such as &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot;, actually prevent aggression. The director was nevertheless an anti-war advocate, a staunch supporter of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, and has openly criticized Japan&#x27;s penchant for conformity, allowing them to be rallied against other nations. He expressed despair and anxiety whenever the youth are told to fall in line, a reminder that the country at its core has not changed.

Despite the public&#x27;s emotional reaction, Takahata expressed that the purpose of the film was not to be a tragedy or make people cry. Moreover, he regretted depicting Seita as a boy from that era because he wanted him to come off as a contemporary boy who acted like he had time-traveled to the period. He didn&#x27;t intend for it to be retrospective or nostalgic. He wanted the Japanese audience to recognize Seita&#x27;s misguided attempts to withdraw from society and family. Furthermore, he says that his decision to show the audience that Seita and Setsuko have died at the beginning of the movie is to protect the audience from heartbreak, &quot;If an audience knows at the beginning of the film that the two will eventually die, they are more prepared to watch the film in the first place. I try to lessen an audience&#x27;s pain by revealing everything at the beginning.&quot;

The fireflies in the film are portrayed as symbols of various themes such as the spirits of the lost children, the fires that burned the towns, Japanese soldiers, the machinery of war, and the regeneration of life through nature. Okypo Moon states in her essay &quot;Marketing Nature in Rural Japan&quot;, that hundreds of fireflies were caught nightly in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a shift to reinstate this tradition and &quot;there are now eighty five &#x27;firefly villages&#x27; (&quot;hotaru no sato&quot;) registered at the Ministry of the Environment in Japan. The movie uses fireflies to visually represent both deadly and beautiful imagery, such as fire-bombs and kamikazes. Takahata chooses to use the &quot;kanji&quot; &quot;fire&quot; instead of the normal character for the word firefly in the title, which has been interpreted to represent the widespread burning of wooden houses in Japan. Critic Dennis H. Fukushima Jr. believes that this modification of the title is to emphasize parallels between beauty and devastation, citing the relationship between fireflies, M-69 incendiary bombs, naval vessels, city lights, and human spirits.

In the book &quot;Imag(in)ing the war in Japan representing and responding to trauma in postwar literature and film&quot;, David Stahl and Mark Williams commend the film for not emphasizing Japanese victimhood to avoid responsibility for atrocities of the war they played a role in. They interpret that Seita&#x27;s character embodies working towards healing historical trauma and victimization, because it is his nationalistic pride and selfishness which ultimately contributed to his sister&#x27;s death.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The film was released on 16 April 1988, over 20 years from the publication of the short story.

The initial Japanese theatrical release was accompanied by Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s light-hearted &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; as a double feature. While the two films were marketed toward children and their parents, the starkly tragic nature of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; turned away many audiences. However, &quot;Totoro&quot; merchandise, particularly the stuffed animals of Totoro and Catbus, sold extremely well after the film and made overall profits for the company to the extent that it stabilized subsequent productions of Studio Ghibli.

&quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; is the only theatrical Studio Ghibli feature film prior to &quot;From Up on Poppy Hill&quot; to which Disney never had North American distribution rights, since it was not produced by Ghibli for parent company Tokuma Shoten but for Shinchosha, the publisher of the original short story (although Disney has the Japanese home video distribution rights themselves, thus replacing the film&#x27;s original Japanese home video distributor, Bandai Visual). It was one of the last Studio Ghibli films to get an English-language premiere by GKIDS.

===Home media and streaming===
&quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; was released in Japan on VHS by Buena Vista Home Entertainment under the &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai&quot; Collection on 7 August 1998. On 29 July 2005, a DVD release was distributed through Warner Home Video. Walt Disney Studios Japan released the complete collector&#x27;s edition DVD on 6 August 2008. WDSJ released the film on Blu-ray twice on 18 July 2012: one as a single release, and one in a two-film set with &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; (even though Disney has never owned the North American rights, only the Japanese rights).

It was released on VHS in North America by Central Park Media in a subtitled form on 2 June 1993. They later released the film with an English dub on VHS on 1 September 1998 (the day Disney released &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;) and an all-Regions DVD (which also included the original Japanese with English subtitles) on 7 October 1998. On 8 October 2002, it was later released on a two-disc DVD set, which once again included both the English dub and the original Japanese with English subtitles as well as the film&#x27;s storyboards with the second disc containing a retrospective on the author of the original book, an interview with the director, and an interview with critic Roger Ebert, who felt the film was one of the greatest of all time. It was released by Central Park Media one last time on 7 December 2004. Following the May 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media, ADV Films acquired the rights and re-released it on DVD on 7 July 2009. Following the 1 September 2009 shutdown and re-branding of ADV, their successor, Sentai Filmworks, rescued the film and released a remastered DVD on 6 March 2012, and planned to release the film on digital outlets. A Blu-ray edition was released on 20 November 2012, featuring an all-new English dub produced by Seraphim Digital.

StudioCanal released a Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 1 July 2013, followed by &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; on the same format. It was the UK&#x27;s tenth annual best-selling foreign language film on home video in 2019 (below seven other Japanese films, including six Hayao Miyazaki anime films). Madman Entertainment released the film in Australia and New Zealand.

On September 16, 2024, the film started streaming exclusively on Netflix in over 190 countries, excluding Japan, as part of ongoing efforts to expand the platform&#x27;s extensive lineup of best-in-class anime from Japan.

==Reception==
The film was modestly successful at the Japanese box office, where it grossed . As part of the Studio Ghibli Fest 2018, the film had a limited theatrical release in the United States, grossing $516,962.

The &quot;Ghibli ga Ippai Collection&quot; home video release of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; sold 400,000 copies in Japan. At a price of at least , this is equivalent to at least in sales revenue.

The film received universal critical acclaim. The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating based on 46 reviews with an average rating of 9.30/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;An achingly sad anti-war film, &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; is one of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s most profoundly beautiful, haunting works.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a score of 94 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; considered it to be one of the best and most powerful war films and, in 2000, included it on his list of great films.

Filmmaker Akira Kurosawa praised the film and considered it his favourite Ghibli production. He wrote a letter of praise to Hayao Miyazaki, mistakenly believing he directed &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;. Miyazaki himself praised the film as Takahata&#x27;s masterpiece, but criticized Seita for not behaving how he believes the son of a navy lieutenant should behave.

The film ranked number 12 on &quot;Total Film&quot;″s 50 greatest animated films. It was also ranked at number 10 in &quot;Time Out&quot;″s &quot;The 50 greatest World War II movies&quot; list. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked the film at number 6 in its list of &quot;The Top 10 Depressing Movies&quot;. The film ranked number 19 on &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Anime&quot; Magazine on their &quot;Top 50 Anime released in North America&quot;. &quot;The Daily Star&quot;, ranking the film 4th on its list of greatest short story adaptations, wrote that &quot;There is both much and little to say about the film. It is simply an experience—a trip through the lonely boroughs of humanity that the world collectively looked, and still looks, away from&quot;. Theron Martin of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; said that, in terms of the original U.S. Manga Corps dub, while the other voices were &quot;perfectly acceptable&quot;, &quot;Setsuko just doesn&#x27;t sound quite convincing as a four-year-old in English. That, unfortunately, is a big negative, since a good chunk of the pathos the movie delivers is at least partly dependent on that performance&quot;.

On 25 December 2016, Toei Company made a Twitter post that read in order to promote an episode of &quot;Kamen Rider Ex-Aid&quot;. The hashtag became popular, but Toei deleted the tweet after receiving complaints that referencing the &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; line was in poor taste. Before that, the ranking website Goo&#x27;s readers voted the film&#x27;s ending the number 1 most miserable of all anime films.

In June 2018, &quot;USA Today&quot; ranked it 1st on the 100 best animated movies of all time.

Film director and critic reviewed &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; on his popular TV series. He praised the film for the honorary image of the soldiers of Japan through the depiction of the fireflies, and the moving depiction of a heartbreaking experience many people of Japan had lived through.

After seeing the reactions of the audience after a screening of the film at &quot;Festival « Pour éveiller les regards »&quot;, Jean-Jacques Varret, head of Les Films du Paradoxe, knew he had to distribute it in France. It was released in two Parisian arthouses and the reaction was modest. Following the release however, Les Films du Paradoxe chose to release the film on video cassettes and on the streaming service Canal+.

===Public reaction===
After the international release, it has been noted that different audiences have interpreted the film differently due to differences in culture. For instance, when the film was watched by a Japanese audience, Seita&#x27;s decision to not come back to his aunt was seen as an understandable decision, because it was understood how Seita had been raised to value pride in himself and his country. Conversely, American and Australian audiences were more likely to perceive the decision as unwise.

===Planned follow-up===
Following the success of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;, Takahata drew up an outline for a follow-up film, based on similar themes but set in 1939 at the start of the Pacific War. This film was called &quot;Border 1939&quot;, based on the novel &quot;The Border&quot; by Shin Shikata, and would have told the story of a Japanese teenager from colonial Seoul joining an anti-Japanese resistance group in Mongolia. The film was intended as an indictment of Japanese imperialist sentiment, which is briefly touched upon in &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;. Although Takahata finished a full outline (which is republished in his book &quot;Thoughts While Making Movies&quot;), the film was canceled before production could start due to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Public opinion in Japan had turned against China, and Ghibli&#x27;s distributor felt a film partly set there was too risky.

===2005 live-action version===

NTV in Japan produced a live-action TV drama of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot;, in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of the war. The drama aired on 1 November 2005. Like the anime, the live-action version of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; focuses on two siblings struggling to survive the final months of the war in Kobe, Japan. Unlike the animated version, it tells the story from the point of view of their cousin (the aunt&#x27;s daughter) and deals with the issue of how the war-time environment could change a kind lady into a hard-hearted woman. The film stars Nanako Matsushima as the aunt and Mao Inoue as the cousin (who also portrays the cousin&#x27;s granddaughter).

===2008 live-action version===
A different live-action version was released in Japan on 5 July 2008, as Seita, as Setsuko, Keiko Matsuzaka as the aunt, and Seiko Matsuda as the children&#x27;s mother. Like the anime, this live-action version of &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; focuses on two siblings struggling to survive the final months of the war in Kobe, Japan.

<doc id="182168" wikidata="Q2090461" url="?curid=182168" title="Arlington, Massachusetts">
<text>Arlington is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. The town is six miles (10 km) northwest of Boston, and its population was 46,308 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

European colonists settled the Town of Arlington in 1635 as a village within the boundaries of Cambridge, Massachusetts, under the name Menotomy, an Algonquian word considered by some to mean &quot;swift running water&quot;, though linguistic anthropologists dispute that translation. A larger area was incorporated on February 27, 1807, as West Cambridge, replacing Menotomy. This includes the town of Belmont, and outwards to the shore of the Mystic River, which had previously been part of Charlestown. The town was renamed Arlington on April 30, 1867, in honor of those buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

The Massachusett tribe lived around the Mystic Lakes, the Mystic River, and Alewife Brook. Chief Nanepashemet was killed by a rival tribe in about 1619, and Nanepashemet&#x27;s widow &quot;Squaw Sachem of Mistick&quot; became the acknowledged leader of the tribe. In 1639, she deeded the land of what was then Cambridge and Watertown to the colonists. She lived her last years on the west side of the Mystic Lakes near Medford, where she died sometime between 1650 and 1667.
A stream called Mill Brook flows through the town, which historically figured largely into Arlington&#x27;s economy. In 1637, Captain George Cooke built the first mill in this area. Subsequently, seven mills were built along the stream, including the Old Schwamb Mill, which still survives. The Schwamb Mill has been a working mill since 1650, making it the longest working mill in the country.

Paul Revere&#x27;s midnight ride to alert colonists took him through Menotomy, now known as Arlington. Later on that first day of the American Revolution, more blood was shed in Menotomy than in the battles of Lexington and Concord combined. Minutemen from surrounding towns converged on Menotomy to ambush the British on their retreat from Concord and Lexington. Twenty-five Americans were killed in Menotomy, half of all Americans killed in the day&#x27;s battles, as well as 40 British troops (more than half their fatalities). Arlington resident Cyrus Dallin would later create an iconic sculpture of the midnight rider; a version can be seen at the town&#x27;s Cyrus Dallin Art Museum.

The Jason Russell House is a museum which remembers those 12 Americans who were killed in and around this pictured dwelling on April 19, 1775. Bullet holes are visible in the interior walls to this day.

In its early years, Arlington was a thriving farming community and had its own lettuce that was quite popular.

Arlington&#x27;s executive branch consists of an elected five-member select board. The day-to-day operations are handled by a town manager hired by the select board.
The legislative branch is a representative town meeting, presided over by the town moderator, and is made up of 252 town meeting members. Twelve town meeting members are elected to staggered three year terms from each of the 21 precincts. Article LXXXIX section 8 of the Massachusetts Constitution permits towns with a population greater than 12,000 to adopt a city form of government. The town of Arlington meets the population requirement to become a city, but has not done so, in part because it would lose its ability to engage citizens in local government under the representative town meeting form of government. Annual town meetings begin in April on the first Monday after Patriots&#x27; Day, and are held two nights a week until all items on the town warrant are resolved, and generally last three to four weeks.

<text>Cornus florida, the flowering dogwood, is a species of flowering tree in the family Cornaceae native to eastern North America and northern Mexico. An endemic population once spanned from southernmost coastal Maine south to northern Florida and west to the Mississippi River. The tree is commonly planted as an ornamental in residential and public areas because of its showy bracts and interesting bark structure.

==Description==

Flowering dogwood is a small deciduous tree growing to high, often wider than it is tall when mature, with a trunk diameter of up to . A 10-year-old tree will stand about tall. The leaves are opposite, simple, ovate, long and broad, with an apparently entire margin (actually very finely toothed, under a lens); they turn a rich red-brown in fall.

Flowering dogwood attains its greatest size and growth potential in the Upper South, sometimes up to 40 feet in height. At the northern end of its range, heights of 30–33 feet are more typical. Hot, humid summer weather is necessary for new growth to harden off in the fall.

The maximum lifespan of &quot;C. florida&quot; is about 80 years.

The flowers are individually small, inconspicuous, and hermaphroditic, with four, greenish-yellow petals (not bracts) long. Around 20 flowers are produced in a dense, rounded, umbel-shaped inflorescence, in diameter. This central flower head is surrounded by four conspicuous large white, pink or red bracts (not petals), each bract long and broad, rounded, and often with a distinct notch at the apex.

When in the wild they can typically be found at the forest edge and frequently on dry ridges. While most of the wild trees have white bracts, some selected cultivars of this tree also have pink bracts, some even almost a true red. They typically flower in early April in the southern part of their range, to late April or early May in northern and high altitude areas. The similar Kousa dogwood (&quot;Cornus kousa&quot;), native to Asia, flowers about a month later.

The fruit is a cluster of two to ten separate drupes, (fused in &quot;Cornus kousa&quot;), each long and about wide, which ripen in the late summer and the early fall to a bright red, or occasionally yellow with a rosy blush. They are an important food source for dozens of species of birds, which then distribute the seeds. They are also a larval host plant for several moth varieties, including &quot;Eudeilinia herminiata&quot;, the dogwood thyatirid moth, &quot;Antispila cornifoliella&quot;, the stinging rose moth, the grand arches moth, the pecan bark borer, the dogwood borer, the rosaceous leaf roller, the diamondback epinotia moth, spring azures, cecropia moths, and the Io moth. While not poisonous to humans, the fruit is extremely sour and unpleasant-tasting. Flowering dogwood is monoecious, meaning the tree has both male and female flowers, and all trees will produce fruit.

== Taxonomy ==
The flowering dogwood is usually included in the dogwood genus &quot;Cornus&quot; as &quot;Cornus florida&quot; L., although it is sometimes treated in a separate genus as &quot;Benthamidia florida&quot; (L.) Spach. Less common names for &quot;C. florida&quot; include American dogwood, Florida dogwood, Indian arrowwood, Cornelian tree, white cornel, white dogwood, false box, and false boxwood.

Two subspecies are generally recognized:
==Diseases==
Dogwood anthracnose caused by the fungi &quot;Discula destructiva&quot; has caused severe mortality of dogwoods. In regions where dogwood anthracnose is a problem, homeowners and public land managers are encouraged to know the symptoms and inspect trees frequently. The selection of healthy, disease-free planting stock is essential and transplanting trees from the forest, particularly from mountain forests, should be avoided. Species of &quot;Phytophthora&quot; cause root rot.

== Cultivation ==
Flowering dogwood does best horticulturally in moist, acidic soil in a site with some afternoon shade, but good morning sun. It does not do well when exposed to intense heat sources such as adjacent parking lots or air conditioning compressors. It also has a low salinity tolerance. The hardiness zone is 5–9 and the preferred pH is between 6.0 and 7.0. In urban and suburban settings, care should be taken not to inflict mower damage on the trunk or roots, as this increases the tree&#x27;s susceptibility to disease and pest pressure. The common flowering dogwood has been placed on the endangered species list in Ontario. Sites should be selected for reasonably well-drained, fertile soils; full sun is recommended in high-hazard areas (such as stream or pond banks). New plantings should be mulched to a depth of , avoiding the stem. Dead wood and leaves should be pruned and completely removed and destroyed yearly. Plants should be watered weekly during droughts, with watering done in the morning, avoiding wetting the foliage. Registered fungicides can be applied when necessary, according to manufacturers instructions and advice of local Extension Service.
Flowering dogwood is grown widely throughout the temperate world.

=== Propagation ===
&quot;Cornus florida&quot; is easily propagated by seeds, which are sown in the fall into prepared rows of sawdust or sand, and emerge in the spring. Germination rates for good clean seed should be near 100% if seed dormancy is first overcome by cold stratification treatments for 90 to 120 days at . Flowering dogwood demonstrates gametophytic self-incompatibility, meaning that the plants cannot self-fertilize. This is important for breeding programs as it means that it is not necessary to emasculate (remove the anthers from) &quot;C. florida&quot; flowers before making controlled cross-pollinations. These pollinations should be repeated every other day, as the flowers must be cross-pollinated within one or two days of opening for pollinations to be effective.

Softwood cuttings taken in late spring or early summer from new growth can be rooted under mist if treated with 8,000 to 10,000 ppm indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). In cold climates, potted cuttings must be kept in heated cold frames or polyhouses the following winter to maintain temperatures between . Although rooting success can be as high as 50–85%, this technique is not commonly used by commercial growers. Rather, selected cultivars are generally propagated by T-budding in late summer or by whip grafting in the greenhouse in winter onto seedling rootstock.

Micropropagation of flowering dogwood is now used in breeding programs aiming to incorporate resistance to dogwood anthracnose and powdery mildew into horticulturally and economically important cultivars. Nodal (axillary bud) sections are established in a culture of Woody Plant Medium (WPM) amended with 4.4 μmol/L 6-Benzyladenine (BA) to promote shoot growth. Rooting of up to 83% can be obtained when 5–7 week-old microshoots are then transferred to WPM amended with 4.9 μmol/L IBA.

== Historical uses ==
Native Americans used the bark and roots in a remedy for malaria; a red dye was also extracted from the roots. The species has been used in the production of inks, scarlet dyes, and as a quinine substitute. The hard, dense wood has been used for products such as golf club heads, mallets, wooden rake teeth, tool handles, jeweler&#x27;s boxes and butcher&#x27;s blocks. It was used to treat dogs with mange, which may be how it got its name. The red berries are not edible, despite some rumors otherwise.

In 1915, 40 dogwood saplings were donated by the U.S. to Japan in the 1912–1915 exchange of flowers between Tokyo and Washington, D.C. While the cherry blossom trees survived the ensuing sour relations of these two countries and are the main feature of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, all dogwood trees in Tokyo died except the one that had been planted in an agriculture high school. In 2012, the U.S. sent 3,000 dogwood saplings to Japan to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Washington, D.C., cherry trees given as a gift to the U.S. by Japan in 1912.

== In culture ==
&quot;Cornus florida&quot; is the state tree and flower of Virginia, the state tree of Missouri, and state flower of North Carolina.

<doc id="182178" wikidata="Q252837" url="?curid=182178" title="Gentile">
<text>Gentile () is a word that today usually means someone who is not Jewish. Other groups that claim Israelite heritage, notably Mormons, have historically used the term &quot;gentile&quot; to describe outsiders. More rarely, the term is used as a synonym for &quot;heathen&quot;, &quot;pagan&quot;. As a term used to describe non-members of a religious/ethnic group, &quot;gentile&quot; is sometimes compared to other words used to describe the &quot;outgroup&quot; in other cultures (see List of terms for ethnic out-groups).

In some translations of the Quran, &quot;gentile&quot; is used to translate an Arabic word that refers to non-Jews and/or people not versed in or not able to read scripture.

The English word &quot;gentile&quot; derives from the Latin word , meaning &quot;of or belonging to the same people or nation&quot; (). Archaic and specialist uses of the word &quot;gentile&quot; in English (particularly in linguistics) still carry this meaning of &quot;relating to a people or nation.&quot; The development of the word to principally mean &quot;non-Jew&quot; in English is entwined with the history of Bible translations from Hebrew and Greek into Latin and English. Its meaning has also been shaped by Rabbinical Jewish thought and Christian theology.

==Etymology==

&quot;Gentile&quot; derives from Latin &quot;&quot;, which itself derives from the Latin &quot;gens&quot;, meaning clan or tribe. &quot;Gens&quot; derives from the Proto-Indo-European , meaning birth or production. The original meaning of &quot;clan&quot; or &quot;family&quot; was extended in post-Augustan Latin to acquire the wider meaning of belonging to a distinct nation or ethnicity. Later still, the word came to refer to other nations, &#x27;not a Roman citizen&#x27;.

In Saint Jerome&#x27;s Latin version of the Bible, the &quot;Vulgate&quot;, &quot;gentilis&quot; was used along with &quot;gentes&quot;, to translate Greek and Hebrew words with similar meanings when the text referred to the non-Israelite peoples. The most important of such Hebrew words was (, plural, ), a term with the broad meaning of &quot;people&quot; or &quot;nation&quot; which was sometimes used to refer to Israelites, but with the plural form &quot;goyim&quot; tending to be used in the Bible to refer to non-Israelite nations. Other words translated in some contexts to mean &quot;gentile/s&quot; in the modern sense were the Biblical Hebrew word &quot;nokhri&quot; ( – often otherwise translated as &#x27;stranger&#x27;) and for the New Testament Greek word &quot;éthenē&quot; (). The first English translators followed this approach, using the word &quot;gentile&quot; to refer to the non-Israelite nations (and principally using the word &quot;nation(s)&quot; to translate &quot;goy/goyim&quot; in other contexts). See the &quot;Christianity&quot; section.

These developments in Bible translation practice were related to developments in Jewish Rabbinical and Christian thinking which – in the centuries after the Old and New Testament were written – created an increasingly clear binary opposition between &quot;Jew&quot; and &quot;non-Jew&quot;. The Hebrew word &quot;goy&quot; went through a change in meaning which parallels the journey of &quot;gentilis/gentile&quot; – both words moving from meaning &quot;nation&quot; to &quot;non-Jew&quot; today. The word &quot;Goy&quot; is now also used in English, principally by Jewish people – see goy.

==Judaism==
===The Hebrew Bible===
In 2006, the academic David Novak wrote, with limited exceptions, &quot;The Bible can be seen as one long discussion of what differentiates Israel from all the other peoples of the world.&quot;

The Hebrew Bible does not have a word which directly corresponds to the modern concept of a &quot;gentile&quot; (see &quot;etymology&quot; above). Instead, the Bible views different groups of gentiles in different ways. Novak states that, &quot;The biblical categories of Gentiles, beginning with those farthest removed from a relationship with Israel and moving up to those closest to a relationship with Israel, seem to be: (1) the Amalekites; (2) the seven Canaanite nations; (3) the nations of the world; (4) the Samaritans; (5) slaves; (6) resident aliens; (7) proselytes.&quot;

The Hebrew Bible does not show much concern for non-Israelites except insofar as they interact with the people of Israel. Nonetheless, because the God of Israel is a universal God, there must be some relationship between gentiles and God. Accordingly, Novak observes, gentiles as well as Israelites are enjoined in the book of Psalms to &quot;ascribe to the Lord glory and strength&quot; ().

Christine E. Hayes states that gentiles in the Hebrew Bible were generally &quot;gerim&quot; (resident aliens). They were not necessarily converts, whether in the modern or rabbinic sense, but were still given many rights and privileges. They were also allowed to keep their distinct ethnic identities. But after Ezra-Nehemiah, many Israelites believed there was an impermeable ritual and genealogical boundary between themselves and gentiles. However, other scholars argue that the boundary is rooted in religious factors.

Saul Oylan argues that gentiles automatically became Israelite when they lived in one of their tribal territories, which was believed to reflect &#x27;early practices&#x27; ().

Troy W. Martin believes Jewishness is defined by adherence to covenantal circumcision, regardless of ancestry (). Thus, even an uncircumcised Jew could be a gentile despite his biological descent from Abraham. He believes this view was extended to the New Testament, where membership in God&#x27;s chosen people was based on religious adherence rather than ancestry (). 

=== Tannaim ===

Tannaim were the rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah, from approximately 10–220 CE.

It was this rabbinic literature of the first centuries CE that developed the concept of the gentile as we understand it today - as &quot;any individual who is not a Jew, erasing all ethnic and social differences among different others&quot;. 

However, the attitudes of the Rabbis to gentiles were not simple or uniform. Porton argues that the Mishnah-Tosefta discusses gentiles for two quite different reasons: firstly, practically, to guide the relations between Israelites and gentiles who were living alongside each other in Palestine. Secondly, at a theoretical level, gentiles are discussed because, in order to define the people of Israel and its symbols and institutions, it was necessary to define who lay outside that group.

Some Tannaim show a positive attitude towards the gentiles. Joshua ben Hananiah believed that there are righteous men amongst the gentiles who will enter the world to come. He believed that except for the descendants of the Amaleks, the rest of the gentiles will adopt monotheism and the righteous among them will escape Gehenna.

Other rabbinical writings show more hostility towards gentiles which needs to be understood in the context of frequent persecution of the Jews in this period. The most famous and extreme of the anti-gentile teachers is Simeon bar Yochai. He is often quoted by antisemites in his sayings: &quot;The best among the Gentiles deserves to be killed&quot;, &quot;The most pious woman is addicted to sorcery&quot; and &quot;The best of snakes ought to have its head crushed&quot;. Such extreme views can be explained by the sage&#x27;s life experience: he witnessed his teacher being tortured to death, and became a fugitive after speaking out against Roman oppression. Later commentators have limited this teaching to idolators and only at times of war.

Eliezer ben Hurcanus writes that the mind of every gentile is always intent upon idolatry. He believed that gentiles only perform animal sacrifice to make a name for themselves. He further believed that gentiles have no share in the world to come.

Eleazar of Modi&#x27;im wrote that Jews, when guilty of the same sin as gentiles, will not enter hell whereas the gentiles will. Eleazar ben Azariah believed that the rulings performed by a gentile court are not valid for Jews. Rabbi Akiva believed that Israel&#x27;s monotheism is far superior to the ever-changing beliefs of the gentiles. Jose the Galilean criticizes Israel for inconsistency compared to the faithfulness of the gentiles to their ancestral beliefs. He believed the good deeds of the gentiles will be rewarded as well.

=== Later sages ===
Rav Ashi believed that a Jew who sells a gentile property adjacent to a Jewish property should be excommunicated. The violation of Jewish women by gentile men was so frequent that the rabbis declared that a woman raped by a gentile should not be divorced from her husband, as Torah says: &quot;The Torah outlawed the issue of a gentile as that of a beast.&quot; A gentile midwife was not to be employed for fear of the poisoning of the baby. The gentiles should be dealt with caution in cases of using them as witness in a criminal or civil suit. The gentile does not honor his promises like that of a Jew. The laws of the Torah were not to be revealed to the gentiles, for the knowledge of these laws might give gentiles an advantage in dealing with Jews. Shimon ben Lakish wrote that &quot;A gentile who observes Sabbath deserves death&quot;.

=== In modern times ===
Under rabbinic law, a modern-day gentile is only required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah, but Jews are required to observe Mosaic law. During periods of decreased animosity between Jews and gentiles, some of the rabbinic laws against fellowship and fraternization were relaxed; for example, Maimonides was the personal physician of Saladin. Even though most contemporary rabbinic schools are not as hostile to Gentiles as Medieval rabbinic schools were, some Orthodox rabbinic schools hold extremely xenophobic views. For example, scholars from the Zionist HaRav Kook yeshiva are schooled in the doctrine that Jews and gentiles have different kinds of souls. One of the yeshiva&#x27;s scholars, David Bar-Hayim, published a paper in 1989 in which he explained the doctrine, entitled &quot;Yisrael Nikraim Adam&quot; (Israel Gentiles Man). In his conclusion, Bar-Hayim writes:
Bar-Chayim further quotes Abraham Isaac Kook (1865–1935), founder of the yeshiva and the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine:
Similar anti-gentile remarks have been expressed by the late chief Sephardi Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, in which he stated in a sermon in 2010 that &quot;The sole purpose of Gentiles is to serve Jews&quot;. He said that gentiles served a divine purpose: &quot;Why are Gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat. That is why Gentiles were created. These remarks by Yosef were sharply criticized by many Jewish organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and American Jewish Committee.

Those who hold these views do not necessarily support any sort of harm to non-Jews. Rav Ovadia Yosef, himself, condemned those who vandalized Arab property, as did the vast majority of Orthodox leaders.

Many Orthodox schools have expressed more humanistic views. Rav Aharon Lichtenstein, Rosh Yeshivah of Gush, for example, strongly opposed what he saw as racist attitudes among certain segments of Religious Zionism. 

Jewish philosopher and professor Menachem Kellner criticizes the assumption of some Orthodox Jews that there is an &quot;ontological divide between Jews and Gentiles&quot;, which he believes is contrary to what the Torah teaches.

=== In Kabbalah ===
Some Kabbalistic writings suggest a distinction between the souls of the gentiles and the souls of the Jews. These writings describe three levels, elements, or qualities of soul:
* &quot;Nefesh&quot; (נפש): the lower part, or &quot;animal part&quot;, of the soul. It is linked to instincts and bodily cravings. This part of the soul is provided at birth.
* &quot;Ruach&quot; (רוח): the middle soul, the &quot;spirit&quot;. It contains the moral virtues and the ability to distinguish between good and evil.
* &quot;Neshamah&quot; (נשמה): the higher soul, or &quot;super-soul&quot;. This separates man from all other life-forms. It is related to the intellect and allows man to enjoy and benefit from the afterlife. It allows one to have some awareness of the existence and presence of God.

Other descriptions of the soul add two more levels Chaya and Yechida.

There has been debate among the kabbalists on whether gentiles access the mystical knowledge (Daat). Isaac Luria, prominent kabbalist, wrote:

Moses de León, presumed author of the main kabbalistic work &quot;Sefer Ha-Zohar&quot;, agrees with this assumption:

The following passage in the &quot;Zohar&quot; reaffirms this idea:

The view that gentiles only possess bestial souls was more popularized by the main kabbalistic text of hasidic movement, the Tanya (or Likkutei Amarim). Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the founder of the Chabad hasidic dynasty, claims that Jews like gentiles possess a vital animal soul, but the animal soul of the Jew comes from the fourth husk (Qlippoth nogah), while the animal soul of the gentiles comes from the three lower impure husks (Qlippoth Tumaot). Thus nothing gentiles do can elevate them to the level of holiness, their soul remains trapped in the unholy world of the impure Qlippoth. 

However, other Kabbalists like Abraham Abulafia believed that higher levels of soul are to some extent accessible to gentiles.

==Christianity==
The Greek &quot;ethnos&quot; where translated as &quot;gentile&quot; in the context of early Christianity implies non-Israelite. In the years after the ministry of Jesus, there were questions over the inclusion of non-Jews and the applicability of the Law of Moses, including circumcision. Over a few centuries, this led to a split between Jewish Christians, who followed Jesus but also Mosaic Law, and Pauline Christianity (also known as Gentile Christianity) which abandoned Mosaic Law and eventually became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Jewish Christian beliefs died out around the fifth century, after being rejected by both orthodox Judaism and orthodox Christianity.

With the ministry of Paul the Apostle the gospel began to be spread among the non-Jewish subjects of the Roman empire. A question existed among the disciples whether receiving the Holy Spirit through proselytization would be restricted to Israelites or whether it would include the gentiles as in :
Within a few centuries, some Christians used the word &quot;gentiles&quot; to mean non-Christians. The alternative &quot;pagani&quot; was felt to be less elegant.

===Christian Bibles===
In the King James Version, &quot;gentile&quot; is only one of several words used to translate &quot;goy&quot; or &quot;goyim&quot;. It is translated as &quot;nation&quot; 374 times, &quot;heathen&quot; 143 times, &quot;gentiles&quot; 30 times, and &quot;people&quot; 11 times. Some of these verses, such as Genesis 12:2 (&quot;I will make of thee a great nation&quot;) and Genesis 25:23 (&quot;Two nations are in thy womb&quot;) refer to Israelites or descendants of Abraham. Other verses, such as Isaiah 2:4 and Deuteronomy 11:23 are generic references to any nation. Typically, the KJV restricts the translation to &quot;gentile&quot; when the text is specifically referring to non-Jewish people. For example, the only use of the word in Genesis is in chapter 10, verse 5, referring to the peopling of the world by descendants of Japheth, &quot;By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.&quot;

In the New Testament, the Greek word &quot;ethnos&quot; is used for peoples or nations in general, and is typically translated by the word &quot;people&quot;, as in John 11:50. (&quot;Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.&quot;) The translation &quot;gentiles&quot; is used in some instances, as in Matthew 10:5–6 to indicate non-Israelite peoples:
Altogether, the word is used 123 times in the King James Version of the Bible, and 168 times in the New Revised Standard Version.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

In the terminology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the word &quot;gentile&quot; can be used to refer to people who are not members of the LDS Church, since members regard themselves as regathered Israelites. The LDS Church&#x27;s website states this about the meaning of gentile in Scripture (including the Book of Mormon), &quot;As used in the scriptures, gentiles has several meanings. Sometimes it designates people of non-Israelite lineage, sometimes people of non-Jewish lineage, and sometimes nations that are without the gospel, even though there may be some Israelite blood among the people. This latter usage is especially characteristic of the word as used in the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants.&quot;

Thus, in such usage, Jewish people may be gentiles because they are not members of the LDS Church.

Beyond this Scriptural usage, &quot;gentile&quot; was widely used by Mormons in day-to-day life in the nineteenth century, with such usage declining through the twentieth century. As with the binary Jew/gentile distinction, the Mormon/gentile distinction arose as Mormons were socially excluded and ostracised: according to John L. Needham of Utah State University: Needham goes on to say that today Mormons have &quot;outgrown the term.&quot;

==Islam==
Some translations of the Quran, such as the famous Pickthall translation, employed the word &quot;gentile&quot; in some instances of the translation of the Arabic word (&quot;al-ʼummiyyīn&quot;), the definite non-nominative masculine plural of (&quot;ʼummiyy&quot;), as in, for example, the following verse:

The word &quot;ummi&quot; occurs six times in the Quran. Pickthall only uses the word gentile once in the above passage and translates other occurrences as illiterate. However many other western scholars of the Quran came to similar conclusion that the word &quot;ummi&quot; is equal to the Hebrew word Goyim. Edward Henry Palmer used the word gentile in his translation of the Quran several times including in the following verse: Palmer like Pickthall did not translate all instances of the word &quot;ummi&quot; as Gentiles, but his comment on chapter 3 verse 19 shows his opinion :Edward William Lane similarly believed that the word &quot;ummi&quot; is identical to the Hebrew Goyim as demonstrated in the following quote :John Medows Rodwell in his translation of the Quran comments similarly in a note on chapter 52 verse 157 that the word &quot;ummi&quot; is equivalent to the Greek &quot;&quot; and the Hebrew &quot;goyim&quot;, and was applied by Jews to those who did not know scripture. Elwood Morris Wherry wrote that almost certainly Some Muslim scholars also agreed with this idea: a French translation of the Quran by Muhammad Hamidullah uses the expression &#x27;gentile prophet&#x27; in Sura 7 verse 157–158. Muhammad Shahrur also believed that &quot;ummi&quot; prophet means gentile prophet in his book Al-Kitab wa-L-Quran (The Book and the Quran). Abul A&#x27;la Maududi similarly translated the following instance as gentile. Maududi clarifies in notes on this verse that the reason this verse has been sent is because Jews looked down on Arabs as gentiles and did not believe that a prophet can rise from their kind.
However vast majority of Islamic scholars and translations made by Muslims are of the idea that &quot;ummi&quot; means illiterate.

<text>Arkham Asylum () is a fictional psychiatric hospital appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in stories featuring Batman. It first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #258 (October 1974), written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil with art by Irv Novick. Located in Gotham City, the asylum houses patients who are criminally insane, as well as select prisoners with unusual medical requirements that are beyond a conventional prison&#x27;s ability to accommodate. Its high-profile patients are often members of Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery.

== History ==
Located in Gotham City, Arkham Asylum is where Batman&#x27;s foes who are considered to be mentally ill are brought as patients (other foes are incarcerated at Blackgate Penitentiary). Although it has had numerous administrators, some comic books have featured Jeremiah Arkham. Inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft, and in particular his fictional city of Arkham, Massachusetts, the asylum was introduced by Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Irv Novick and first appeared in &quot;Batman&quot; #258 (October 1974); much of its history was established by Len Wein during the 1980s.

Arkham Asylum has a poor security record and high recidivism rate, at least with regard to the high-profile cases—patients, such as the Joker, are frequently shown escaping at will—and those who are considered to no longer be mentally unwell and discharged tend to re-offend. Several of its staff are corrupt or insane.

Gotham criminals deemed &quot;criminally insane&quot; or &quot;mentally unfit&quot; by the court of law are treated at Williams Medical Center before being deemed dangerous enough to be sent to Arkham Asylum.

== Origins ==

Arkham Asylum has a long and brutal history, beginning when its architect became mentally unwell, killed several workers with an axe, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in Arkham. Arkham&#x27;s founder, Amadeus Arkham, previously killed his mother due to her mental illness and suppressed the memory, believing her death to be a suicide. Later, serial killer Martin Hawkins, also known as Mad Dog, kills Amadeus&#x27; wife and daughter. Following this, Amadeus kills Hawkins during electroshock therapy and is committed to Arkham, where he eventually dies.

== Publication history ==
In &quot;Batman&quot; #258, it is named as Arkham Hospital, although it is not clear what kind of hospital it is. &quot;Arkham Asylum&quot; first appeared in another Dennis O&#x27;Neil story the following year, but it was not until 1979 that Arkham Asylum completely replaced Arkham Hospital, and the occasional Arkham Sanitarium, as the institution&#x27;s name. Also in 1979, the move to have the asylum closer to Gotham had begun; that was completed in 1980, when &quot;Batman&quot; #326 by Len Wein described the asylum&#x27;s location in the suburbs of Gotham City.

Arkham Asylum has been demolished or destroyed several times in its history, including &quot;Batman: The Last Arkham&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Batman Eternal&quot;.

== Patients ==
Originally, Arkham Asylum was used only to house genuinely mentally ill patients having no connection to Batman, but over the course of the 1980s, a trend was established in having the majority of Batman&#x27;s adversaries end up at Arkham.

Arkham Asylum is also featured in other DC Comics publications, apart from the Batman comic book titles. In Alan Moore&#x27;s run in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; the Floronic Man is detained there and in &quot;The Sandman&quot; by Neil Gaiman, Doctor Destiny escapes the asylum to wreak havoc on both the real and dream worlds. It has also been featured in varying capacities in a number of DC miniseries events, such as &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; and &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;, among others.

<doc id="182188" wikidata="Q247" url="?curid=182188" title="Volkswagen Golf">
<text>The Volkswagen Golf () is a compact car/small family car (C-segment) produced by the German automotive manufacturer Volkswagen since 1974, marketed worldwide across eight generations, in various body configurations and under various nameplates – including as the Volkswagen Rabbit in the United States and Canada (Mk1 and Mk5), and as the Volkswagen Caribe in Mexico (Mk1).

The original Golf Mk1 was a front-engined, front-wheel drive replacement for the air-cooled, rear-engined, rear-wheel drive Volkswagen Beetle. Historically, the Golf is Volkswagen&#x27;s best-selling model and is among the world&#x27;s top three best-selling models, with more than 35 million units sold as of 2019.

Initially, most Golfs were hatchbacks, with the three-door version being somewhat more popular than the five-door. Other variants include an estate (Variant, from 1993), convertible (Cabriolet or Cabrio, from 1979), and a Golf-based saloon called the Jetta, Vento (from 1992), or Bora (from 1999). The Golf covers economy to high-performance market segments.

The Golf has won awards, including the World Car of the Year in 2009, with the Mk6 and in 2013 with the Mk7. Along with the Renault Clio and the Vauxhall Astra, the Golf is one of only three cars to have won European Car of the Year twice, in 1992 and 2013. The Golf has made the annual Car and Driver 10Best list multiple times. The Mk7 won the Motor Trend Car of the Year award in 2015, and the Mk1 GTI also won the award in 1985. The Mk4 won for the best-selling car in Europe in 2001.

==First generation (Mk1/A1, &quot;Typ&quot; 17; 1974)==

In May 1974, Volkswagen presented the first-generation Golf as a modern front-wheel-drive, long-range replacement for the Volkswagen Beetle. Later Golf variations included the Golf GTI (introduced in June 1976 with a fuel-injected 1.6-litre engine capable of ), a diesel-powered version (from September 1976), the Jetta notchback saloon version (from October 1979), the Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet (from January 1980 through 1994) and a Golf-based van and pickup, the Volkswagen Caddy.

The Golf Mk1 was sold as the Volkswagen Rabbit in the United States and Canada and as the Volkswagen Caribe in Mexico.

A facelifted version of the Golf Mk1 was produced in South Africa as the Citi Golf from 1984 to 2009.
==Second generation (Mk2/A2, &quot;Typ&quot; 19E/1G; 1983)==

September 1983 saw the introduction of the second-generation Golf (Mk2) which grew slightly in terms of wheelbase, and exterior, and interior dimensions, while retaining, in a more rounded form, the Mk1&#x27;s overall look. Although it was available on the home market and indeed most other left-hand drive markets by the end of 1983, it was not launched in the UK until March 1984.

The Mk2 GTI featured a 1.8-litre 8-valve fuel-injected engine from its launch, with a 16-valve version capable of more than being introduced in 1985.

In 1985, the first Golfs with four-wheel-drive (Golf Syncro) went on sale with the same Syncro four-wheel-drive system being employed on the supercharged G60 models, exclusively released in continental Europe in 1989 with and anti-lock brakes (ABS).

An Mk2-based second-generation Jetta was unveiled in January 1984. There was no Mk2-based cabriolet model; instead, the Mk1 Cabriolet was continued over the Mk2&#x27;s entire production run.
==Third generation (Mk3/A3, &quot;Typ&quot; 1H/1E/1V; 1991)==


The third-generation Golf (Mk3) made its home-market debut in August 1991 and again grew slightly in comparison with its immediate predecessor, while its wheelbase remained unchanged.

New engines included the first Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine in a Golf, and a narrow-angle 2.8-litre VR6 engine. US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel consumption estimates are (city) and (highway), with per tank (city) and per tank (highway). For the first time ever, a Golf estate (Golf Variant) joined the line-up in September 1993 (although most markets did not receive this model until early 1994). At the same time, a completely new Mk3-derived Cabriolet was introduced, replacing the 13-year-old Mk1-based version with one based on the Mk3 Golf platform from 1995 to early 1999. The Mk3 Golf Cabrio received an Mk4-style facelift in late 1999 and was continued until 2002.

The notchback version, called VW Vento (or Jetta in North America), was presented in January 1992.

It was European Car of the Year for 1992, ahead of the new Citroën ZX and General Motors&#x27; new Opel Astra model.

The Mk3 continued to be sold until 1999 in the United States, Canada, and parts of South America, also in Mexico as a special edition called &quot;Mi&quot; (basically a Golf CL 4-door with added air conditioning, special interior, original equipment (OEM) black-tinted rear brake lights, and anti-lock brakes (ABS), but without a factory-fitted radio). The &quot;i&quot; in &quot;Mi&quot; is coloured red, which designates that multi-point fuel injection was equipped and the 1.8-litre engine was upgraded to 2.0-litre. Heated seats were offered on all trims.

==Fourth generation (Mk4/A4, &quot;Typ&quot; 1J; 1997)==

The Golf Mk4 was first introduced in August 1997 and later released in October of that same year as the 1998 model, followed by a notchback version (VW Bora or, in North America, again VW Jetta) in August 1998 and a new Golf Variant (estate) in March 1999. There was Mk4-derived Cabriolet, although the Mk3 Cabriolet received a facelift in late 1999 that consisted of bumpers, grille, and headlights similar to those of the Mark IV models.

As with the earlier three versions of the Golf, the UK market received each version several months later than the rest of Europe. The hatchback version was launched there in the spring of 1998 and the estate some 12 months later (around the same time as the Bora).

New high-performance models included the 3.2-litre VR6-engined four-wheel-drive Golf &quot;R32&quot; introduced in 2002, its predecessor, the 2.8-litre VR6-engined &quot;Golf V6 4Motion&quot; (succeeding the 2.9-litre Mk3 &quot;Golf VR6 Syncro&quot;), as well as the famous 1.8T (turbo) 4-cylinder used in various Volkswagen Group models.

=== Extended production (Mk4.5) ===

Since 2008, certain variants of the Golf/Bora Mk4 (nicknamed the Mk4.5) were still in production in Brazil, China, and Mexico. Revised versions of the Mk4.5 were sold in Canada and marketed as the City Golf and Jetta City from 2007 to 2010. The two models were VW Canada&#x27;s entry-level offerings. They received a significant refresh for the 2008 model year, including revised headlamps, taillamps, front and rear fascias, sound systems, and wheels. Both models were offered only with the 2.0-litre, 8-valve single overhead cam (SOHC) four-cylinder gasoline engine, rated at . They were the only entry-level offerings with an optional six-speed automatic transmission. Production of the European variant of the Golf Mk4 ceased at the end of the 2006 model year. Production of the U.S. version ended in 2006.

When the Chinese market Bora received a July 2006 facelift, the Golf did too, becoming the &quot;Bora HS&quot; in the process.

The Mk4.5 facelift was produced in Brazil until 2013.

==Fifth generation (Mk5/A5, &quot;Typ&quot; 1K; 2003)==

The Golf Mk5 was introduced in Europe in the autumn of 2003, reaching the UK market in early 2004. In North America, Volkswagen brought back the Rabbit nameplate when it introduced the vehicle in 2006. In Canada, the Golf is still the prevalent nameplate of the fifth generation (though both Rabbit and Golf have been used historically). The North American base model is powered by a 2.5-litre five-cylinder engine, which produced in 2006 and 2007, but was upped to in the later models. A GTI version is powered by a turbocharged version of the 2.0-litre FSI engine, producing . 

An R32 version features the 3.2-litre VR6 engine, increasing power output to and including the Haldex Traction-based 4motion part-time four-wheel drive system. The R32 went on a limited production run in 2005 for the European market. Then in 2007, 5000 units of the R32 were made for the US, each with its production number laser etched on its steering wheel.

Volkswagen also introduced the &quot;Fast&quot; marketing campaign for the US, &quot;dedicated to the &#x27;fast&#x27; that lives inside every driver,&quot; with a spirit totem character illustrating the concept and purchasers of the GTI Mk5 receiving a plastic figurine of the &quot;Fast&quot;. The GTI version is the only version on sale in Mexico.

The saloon/sedan version, again widely marketed by Volkswagen as the Jetta, is assembled in Germany, South Africa, as well as Mexico. It is marketed in certain markets, including European markets and Mexico as &quot;Bora&quot;. It was followed in 2007 by a new Golf Variant. The front ends of the car are the same, with the only difference being that the GLI is a sedan, while the GTI is a hatchback.

Later models of the Mk5 introduced the 1.4-litre TSI turbocharged petrol engine with front-wheel drive.

In a comparison test conducted by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; Magazine, the Rabbit won vs eight small cars. It was praised for its driving position, instruments, and engine; and was criticized for road noise, seating, and poor fuel economy. The Rabbit also placed first in their final comparison in December 2006.

==Sixth generation (Mk6/A6, &quot;Typ&quot; 5K; 2008)==
Volkswagen based the Golf Mk6 on the existing PQ35 platform from the Golf Mk5. This vehicle was debuted at the 2008 Paris Motor Show.

The Mk6 Golf was designed by Volkswagen&#x27;s chief designer Walter de&#x27;Silva. The design is said to be more aerodynamic, helping fuel efficiency, and is quieter than its predecessor. Following criticism of the downgraded interior trim quality of the Mk5 Golf in comparison to the Mk4, Volkswagen opted to overhaul the interior to match the quality of the Mk4 Golf, while maintaining the same user friendliness from the Mk5. The car is also cheaper to build than its predecessor; Volkswagen claims it consequently will be able to pass these savings on to the customer.

The Mk6 Jetta was released in Mexico in mid-2010, and by late 2011 it was available in all markets. Turbocharged Direct Injection diesel engines which uses common rail injection technology replaced the longstanding Pumpe Düse (PD) Unit Injector system. New on the Golf is the optional Volkswagen Adaptive Chassis Control (not available in the North American market), which allows the driver to select between &#x27;normal&#x27;, &#x27;comfort&#x27;, and &#x27;sports&#x27; modes, which will vary the suspension, steering, and accelerator behavior accordingly.

The Mk6 Golf is available with both 5- and 6-speed manual transmission, and 6- or 7-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG)(with Dual Clutch) transmission options. In North America, the Mk5 version was originally sold as the Rabbit from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, Volkswagen brought back the Golf nameplate with the mid-cycle refresh. With it came a , 2.5-litre inline five-cylinder with 240 N·m (177 lb·ft) of torque and a 2.0-litre, turbocharged inline four-cylinder diesel engine that generates 320 N·m (236 lb·ft) of torque. The GTI version is equipped with a turbocharged inline four-cylinder TSI gasoline engine while the Golf R has a turbocharged TFSI inline-four engine. All three engines can be paired with a DSG dual-clutch 6-speed automatic or 6-speed manual transmission in either a 3- or 5-door configuration.

The car was introduced for sale in the UK in January 2009, and in North America in October 2009 as the 2010 Golf, rather than Rabbit. The Mk6 also reintroduced a diesel engine option to the North American market.

The Volkswagen Golf Mk6 was a 2012 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) Top Safety Pick.
==Seventh generation (Mk7, &quot;Typ&quot; 5G; 2012)==
The seventh-generation Golf had its debut in September 2012 at the Paris Motor Show.

The Golf VII, Typ 5G used the new MQB platform, shared with the third-generation Audi A3, SEAT León and Škoda Octavia. It was slightly larger than the Mk6 while managing to be approximately 100  kg lighter, depending on engine choice. The GTI offered a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder with an available performance pack to raise the output to . The Golf R had a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder with Haldex Traction all-wheel-drive.

A version of the GTI dubbed the GTI Clubsport making was released in 2016. A variant of the Clubsport called the Clubsport S held the record for the fastest front-wheel-drive car around the Nürburgring until the 2017 Honda Civic Type-R took the record once again.

The Golf line was available in all the relevant drive systems: the Golf TSI, including GTI, was petrol-powered; Golf TDI diesel (Turbo Direct Injection), including GTD, was diesel-powered; the Golf TGI was powered by compressed natural gas (CNG); the e-Golf was powered by electricity, and the Golf GTE was a plug-in hybrid. The use of a modular transverse matrix assembly kit enabled the manufacturing of Golf models with gasoline, diesel, natural gas, electric, and hybrid drives from bumper to bumper at Volkswagen factories.

In November 2016, Volkswagen revealed a facelifted version (Golf 7.5) to the 3-door hatchback, 5-door hatchback, 5-door estate, GTI, and GTE, in addition to a new &quot;R-Line&quot; Golf. With those models, came a new economical engine: 1.5-litre TSI EVO which produced or and replaced the 1.4-litre TSI. The updated GTI version featured a 230 hp as standard (220 hp previously) or 247 hp in the optional performance pack (230 hp previously).
In terms of interior technology, the Golf featured a 12.3&quot; TFT display as an option similar to Audi models and known as &quot;Virtual Cockpit&quot;, full LED lights, animated tail indicators as an option (also used in Audi models), etc.

The most powerful Golf in the range was the Golf R. Built as a 3 or 5 door hatchback, it was powered by a newly developed version of the turbocharged EA888 petrol FSI straight-four engine used in the latest Golf GTI (and Audi S3), but in this application producing ( for &quot;hot climate&quot; markets such as Australia, Japan, USA) from 5,500 to 6,200 rpm and from 1,800 to 5,500 rpm of torque. 0-62 mph (100 km/h) takes 5.1 seconds (versus 5.7 seconds for previous Golf R), or 4.9 seconds with optional DSG gearbox. In 3rd-party testing, it has been recorded at 4.5 seconds using Launch Control. The top speed is electronically limited to .

Volkswagen produced a &quot;Rabbit Edition&quot; GTI for the 2019 model year. Only 3,000 were produced for the US market: 1000 in Cornflower Blue, 1000 in Urano Gray, 500 in Black, and 500 in White, all split evenly between DSG automatic and 6-speed manual transmissions. The Rabbit Edition featured a LED lighting package, a &quot;Vmax&quot; spoiler, 18-inch &quot;Pretoria&quot; alloy wheels painted in gloss black, no sunroof, and Clark plaid seats with red tags embroidered with the VW Rabbit logo. Canada also received a Rabbit Edition in 2019. Only 900 were produced: 272 in Cornflower Blue, 272 in Urano Grey, 178 in Pure White and 178 in Pure Black Pearl. The Canadian variant came with all the Rabbit specific cosmetic upgrades, but also included all the same features as the top level Autobahn package with the exception of the sunroof, satnav and leather seats. 

In Mexico, the production of the Volkswagen Golf VII finished in 2021.

== Eighth generation (Mk8, CD1; 2020) ==
The Mk8 Golf was revealed on 24 October 2019 in Wolfsburg. It rides on an updated version of the MQB platform, with engine options consisting of compact petrol, diesel, and hybrid powertrains. At launch, the five-door hatchback was the only model available, with the three-door hatchback having been discontinued due to poor sales. The Golf VIII&#x27;s interior receives a major overhaul with an entirely digital driver&#x27;s display and digital control panel. All Mk8s have advanced safety features available such as travel assist, Car2X, and an oncoming vehicle while braking function, the latter two of which are the first to be used on a production Volkswagen model.

Powertrain options now have three ETSI mild-hybrid and two hybrids plug-in hybrid engines in addition to existing TSI petrol, TDI diesel, and TGI compressed natural gas (CNG) options. All TSI engines with an output up to 130 PS feature the efficient TSI Miller combustion process and a turbocharger with variable turbocharger geometry, and the 1.5-litre engines have temporary Active Cylinder Management. ETSI models use a 12 V vehicle electrical system and 48 V belt starter generator driven by the 48 V lithium-ion battery, whereas hybrid models have a 13 kWh lithium-ion battery capable of running in EV mode. TDI models utilize a new twin dosing SCR system featuring dual AdBlue selective catalytic reduction, which lowers nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) up to 80% compared to the Mk7. Performance models consist of the GTE, GTI, GTD, and Golf R. The GTE and GTI produce , the GTD produces , while the R produces The e-Golf previously offered on the Mk7 has been replaced by the ID.3.
==Electric versions==

The VW Golf has had several generations made into electric &quot;CityStromer&quot; models. The first of these was in the 1970s when VW took a standard Golf Mk1 and converted it to electric power. By the time the Golf Mk2 came into production a limited number of electric Golfs were made, using lead–acid battery packs and a custom-made motor and controller. VW continued with the production of limited numbers of CityStromer electric cars with the introduction of the Golf Mk3. The electric CityStromer Mk3 included a Siemens-based AC drive system, and lead–acid battery packs. They had a maximum speed of and a range of approximately . With a few exceptions, only left-hand drive Golfs were converted by VW into Citystromer models. These vehicles are still used today and have popularity in mainland Europe with only a few present in Great Britain. Only two right-hand drive Mk2 CityStromers were built for the UK market and it is believed only one remains today. It is owned by EV advocate and broadcaster Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, host of Transport Evolved.

===Golf Variant Twin Drive===
As part of the &quot;Fleet study in electric mobility&quot; project that began in 2008, VW developed the Golf Variant twinDRIVE plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and built twenty examples for research. These vehicles have an all-electric range of and the internal combustion engine provides for a total range of . The plug-in hybrid drive of the Golf Variant twinDRIVE is equipped with either an 11.2 kWh or a 13.2 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, as Volkswagen is testing packs from two vendors. Ten vehicles are equipped with batteries from the American-German manufacturer GAIA with cathode type nickel cobalt aluminium dioxide (NCA). The other ten is powered by lithium-ion batteries with nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cathodes from the Korean-German joint venture SB LiMotive (Samsung and Bosch). These 10 vehicles have been in use since early 2011. Both battery systems offer high power and energy density. They each weigh about . The gasoline engine is used to support the electric heating system when outdoor temperatures are low.

Using guidelines for determining the fuel consumption of plug-in hybrids, VW estimated a fuel consumption of 2.1 L/100 km (112 mpg US), which is equivalent to 49 g/km CO2. When the battery is fully charged, the Golf Variant twinDRIVE is designed to maximize the share of pure electrical energy used for driving, and only when longer distances are driven does the share of supplemental gasoline fuel increase. Top speed of the car is and it accelerates to 100 km/h (62 mph) in under 12 seconds. When operated in pure electric mode, the Golf Variant twinDRIVE can reach a top speed of .

The production version was expected to be based on Mk6 Golf featuring a 1.5 L turbodiesel engine and electric motor, with estimated arrival date of 2015. A SEAT León prototype with the Twin Drive system was also under development.

===Volkswagen e-Golf===

==== Concept version ====

Based on the Golf Mk6, the Golf blue-e-motion concept has a range of . Volkswagen scheduled a field testing program with 500 units to begin in 2011. The first 10 units began field testing in Wolfsburg in May 2011. A second batch of 80 test cars began testing in June 2011 in Berlin, Hannover and Wolfsburg. In February 2012, the first e-Golf, as the production version was renamed, was delivered in Belmont, California. A total of 20 e-Golfs were allocated to the U.S. field testing program.

The Golf blue-emotion concept has a 26.5 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and is powered by an 85 kW electric motor which drives the front wheels through a single-speed transmission. It will accelerate to in 11.8 seconds and has a top speed of . Paddle shifters are used to adjust the amount of regenerative braking. The vehicle&#x27;s PRNDL stick has an additional &#x27;B&#x27; mode as found on some other electric vehicles to set the regenerative braking effort to the maximum for sustained downhill travelling.

; Production version

The production version of the 2015 Volkswagen e-Golf was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. According to VW the e-Golf has a practical all-electric range of , with an official NEDC cycle of , and the winter range is expected to be . The 2015 e-Golf has an official EPA rated all-electric range of , and a combined fuel economy of 116 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (MPGe) for an energy consumption of 29 kW-hrs/100 mi. The EPA rating for city driving is 126 MPGe and 105 MPGe for the highway. Production of vehicles destined for retail customers began in March 2014.

For the 2017 model year, the e-Golf received an update, which included an improved range, better fuel economy, and more power than the outgoing model. With a new 35.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, the upgraded car is said to achieve an EPA-estimated range of , and have a combined 119 MPGe. The 2017 e-Golf also provides a faster charging time; SE and SEL Premium trim levels have a 7.2 kW unit that allows the battery to be fully charged in under six hours at a 240 V charging station. There is an optional (standard on SEL Premium) DC Fast Charging feature that allows the car to be charged to 80% in only an hour at a DC fast charging station.

; Markets and sales

On 14 February 2014, Volkswagen launched sales of the e-Golf in Germany. On 11 March 2014, Volkswagen opened ordering for the e-Golf in the UK, with deliveries began at the end of June.

In Norway, the e-Golf became available for pre-order on 25 February 2014 for delivery in June 2014. European sales totaled 3,328 units in 2014, and 1,214 units in 2015.

The 2015 e-Golf did not have a liquid-cooled battery pack because strict testing showed high ambient temperatures did not affect battery performance. U.S. sales were slated to start on selected states in November 2014. In January 2015, the e-Golf started to show up at dealerships throughout the Northeast.

Production of the e-Golf ended in December 2020.

===Volkswagen Golf GTE===
The Golf GTE is a plug-in hybrid version of the Golf hatchback unveiled at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. The Golf GTE shares the basic powertrain hardware with the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron but the software controls are different. The Golf GTE also shares the same plug-in hybrid powertrain with the Volkswagen Passat GTE, but the Passat has a larger 9.9 kWh Li-ion battery pack.

The GTE Mark 7 generation was powered by a 1.4-litre TSI direct-injection gasoline engine combined with a electric motor, powered by a 400 V 8.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, for a total hybrid system power of around . The electric motor delivered a theoretical all-electric range of and the hybrid system a total theoretical range of (measured using NEDC). The all-electric mode can be activated at the push of a button. Under the New European Driving Cycle, combined fuel economy is equivalent ( in generation 8). The Golf GTE has a top speed of in the all-electric mode and accelerates from in under 7.6 seconds.

In the Mark 8 generation, available from model year 2021, the electric motor power was increased to , the total system power to , the battery capacity to 13 kWh, and the all-electric range to 60 kilometers (measured using WLTP). The fuel tank was diminished from 50 litres (10.6 gallons) to 40 litres (8.8 gallons).

The vehicle can be recharged from a Type 2 charging point in about 2 hours, or from a standard 230 V wall outlet in approximately 4 hours (6 hours for generation 8). In common with other plug-in hybrid vehicles, the vehicle may be used in pure electric mode, parallel-hybrid (petrol + electric), and range-extender mode (petrol engine recharging the high-voltage battery).

The GTE release to retail customers was scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2014. The first units were registered in Germany in August 2014. The Golf GTE, with 1,695 units sold, was the best-selling plug-in hybrid in France in 2015, representing 30.3% of the segment sales. With 17,300 units sold in Europe in 2015, the Golf GTE ranked as the second top selling plug-in hybrid after the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV (31,214). According to JATO Dynamics, a total of 18,397 units have been registered in Europe through December 2015. The Golf GTE was temporarily discontinued in 2018, due to high demand leading to long lead times, according to Volkswagen.

<text>Archives New Zealand (Māori: &quot;Te Rua Mahara o te Kāwanatanga&quot;) is New Zealand&#x27;s national archive and the official guardian of its public archives. As the government&#x27;s recordkeeping authority, it administers the Public Records Act 2005 and promotes good information management throughout government.

==History==
===Establishment===
In 1954, the First National Government&#x27;s cabinet approved the establishment of a national archive and the office of a chief archivist, and the drafting of enabling legislation. The Archives Act 1957 established the National Archives within the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA). It also gave the chief archivist the power to approve the disposal of official records and to require the transfer of records to the National Archives after 25 years. The Archives Act also affirmed public access to the National Archives. While the National Archives were established in 1957, they were preceded by the Dominion Archives and the former war archives at the Hope Gibbons building in Wellington.

===Expansion and legislative entrenchment===
In 1977, an amendment to the Local Government Act 1974 extended limited protection to local government archives. For the first twenty years, the National Archives had to contend with inadequate storage and staffing. Following Wilfred I. Smith&#x27;s report, the Government took steps to address those issues, the headquarters moving into the 1966 4-storey building of the former Government Printing Office on Thorndon Quay in 1990. The National Archives&#x27; legal position was further entrenched by the passage of legislation such as the Ombudsmen Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, and the State Sector Act 1988.

In 2000, the National Archives was separated from the Department of Internal Affairs and renamed as Archives New Zealand.

In 2005, the Fifth Labour Government passed the Public Records Act 2005 to deal with digital archives and the creation of state-owned enterprises. The Act also greatly expanded the role of Archives New Zealand and the powers of the Chief Archivist, and established the Archives Council to advise the Minister responsible for Archives New Zealand. The organisation now has a leadership role for recordkeeping throughout central and local government.

===Reintegration under Internal Affairs, 2011–present===
In 2011, Archives New Zealand and the National Library of New Zealand were merged back into the Department of Internal Affairs. Before 1 February 2011 Archives New Zealand was a separate government department.

In 2018, the Christchurch office moved to a new location in Wigram near the Air Force Museum of New Zealand.

The &quot;New Zealand Archivist&quot; Vol 3 No 1 pages 5–10 includes a more comprehensive history of archives in New Zealand.

In December 2020, the DIA confirmed that Archives NZ along with the National Library and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision would move to a proposed purpose-built business park called the Horowhenua Business Park in Levin at an unspecified future date.

In February 2022 Internal Affairs Minister Jan Tinetti, Archives NZ chief archivist Stephen Clarke and Māori iwi (tribe) Taranaki Whānui Te Āti Awa confirmed that the Government would build a new archives building on the site of the former Defence House on Wellington&#x27;s Aitken Street between the present Archives NZ and National Library buildings. The new NZ$290 million building will have 19,300sqm of lettable area and is expected to open in 2026. It will host archives repository and specialist facilities for Archives NZ, the National Library and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision.

On 9 May 2024, Archives NZ halted its digitisation programme which had commenced seven years ago, citing the programme&#x27;s time-limited funding. The disestablishment of the digitisation programme is expected to cause the loss of three permanent jobs and some fixed time positions. Historian Vincent O&#x27;Malley described the termination of the digitisation programme as &quot;a devastating blow.&quot;

==Facilities==
The national office for Archives New Zealand is in Wellington. It also has offices in Auckland, Christchurch, and Dunedin.

===Planned Facilities===
A new $290 million national archives facility is set to be completed in Wellington by 2026. The new facility, which began construction in 2022, will have a greater capacity to house the country’s rapidly growing archival collections and to maintain and protect collections during incidents such as power outages and earthquakes. 
Its design has been created with te ao Māori worldview in mind, with design agency Tīhei and Māori sculptural artist Rangi Kipa working alongside architects Warren &amp; Mahoney to “connect the building to the land it sits on and acknowledge the tūpuna who lived there before”.

The Department of Internal Affairs is working alongside Fund Managers AMP Capital Ltd. to build the new Archives facility with construction partners, LT McGuiness.

* Regional &amp; Access Services;
* Archives Management;
* Government Recordkeeping; and
* Māori &amp; Community Archives.

== Functions ==
Archives New Zealand:

* manages the Public Records Act 2005 and works with government agencies to administer the Act;
* makes sure records of government decision making are created and those of long-term value, including digital, are transferred into its care;
* provides recordkeeping advice and information to government agencies;

Information and Records Management Standard

Archive information and records management standards are of the utmost importance as it ensures consistency of delivery for organisations utilising Archive NZ&#x27;s services. For Archives New Zealand, they act as underpinning principles for their purpose of collecting, preserving, and providing access to records which hold historical, legal and cultural significance. Under section 27 of the Public Records Act 2005, the Chief Archivist of Archives New Zealand holds this responsibility and has issued such standards. To issue a standard, the Chief Archivist must make a copy of the draft available and have a process in place to communicate with every public office, approved repository, local authority and any other person considered to be impacted by or interested in the proposed standard.

These standards support and establish how Archive NZ can manage their information and records systematically and efficiently. It outlines the obligations of Archives NZ and other regulated organisations under the Public Records Act and sets out the minimum level of compliance that these organisations must meet. ‘Records are considered to be any information, regardless of form and format, from documents through to data’. Alongside this, they are also used as evidence of business activity and information assets. They also include metadata which is managed as a record.

The standard also supports the rights of Māori, under the Treaty of Waitangi/Te Tiriti o Waitangi to access, use and reuse any information and records that are taonga.

Information and records are key strategic assets for the public sector. Therefore, managing information and records appropriately is important in various different ways for Archives NZ including enabling the public to hold the government accountable; helps any organisations plan for and achieve their objectives; gives information to support informed decision making; outlines individual responsibilities; documents individuals and different groups entitlements; encourages collaboration and communication; facilities groups to be creative and also ensures that important public knowledge is available for research, discovery and reuse.

With these important factors to consider, all information and records should be:

* trustworthy and managed accountably
* readily accessible, understandable and usable
* valued as critical to business operations
* part of an organisation’s approach to risk management
* maintained to meet business, government and community purposes

===Regulatory role and powers===
Archives New Zealand are the regulators of all information created by the public sector in New Zealand. Their regulatory role is to ensure information is created and managed to a high standard, to ensure transparency and accountability and support the rights and entitlements of New Zealand citizens.

In order to execute this role, Archives New Zealand are granted several directive powers. Their regulatory tools include:

*Direction to report: A report back order issued by the Chief Archivist to organisations with record keeping practices that arise concern.
*Inspection: The inspection of public records, local authority records and local authority archives by the Chief Archivist if information management issues have arisen within public offices or local authorities.
*Audit: Audits are regularly carried out by independent auditors in order to determine the health of information management in the public sector.
*Issuing of penalties: It is an offence under the Public Records Act to willfully or negligently damage, dispose of, or destroy any public record, unless it is authorised under by the Chief Archivist. Archives New Zealand can impose penalties on individuals or organisations that do not comply with the PRA. Persons convicted of an offence may also be trespassed from Archives offices and services.

== Archives Council Te Rua Wānanga ==
The Archives Council Te Rua Wānanga is an unincorporated body established under the Public Records Act 2005. It provides independent advice to the Minister responsible for Archives New Zealand on recordkeeping and archives matters, including those for which tikanga Māori is relevant.

The Archives Council meets four times a year to discuss archival and record keeping matters. The Council reports directly to the Minister on its functions during the preceding year. The Minister, as soon as practicable, presents the report to the House of Representatives.

The Archives Council&#x27;s reports to the Minister are available on Archives New Zealand&#x27;s website.

==Holdings==

Archives New Zealand holds more than 7 million New Zealand government records dating from the early 19th to the early 21st century. Records held include the originals of the Treaty of Waitangi, government documents, maps, paintings, photographs and film.

Significant holdings include:

* the archives of the New Zealand Company;
* the New Zealand Parliament&#x27;s archives;
* commissions of inquiry documents;
* most higher court records;
* archives of government agencies;
* New Zealand Defence Force archives.
* the National Film Unit &quot;Weekly Review&quot; and &quot;Pictorial Parade&quot; archives; audiovisual weekly news bulletin archives dating between 1941 to 1971, which were included as an entry on the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register in 2011.
* the Māori Land Court minute books archives, which were included as an entry on the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao registerin 2012.
* the Crown Purchase Deeds, deeds to land purchases from Māori by the Crown, included as an entry on the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register in 2020.
* the Canterbury Provincial Government Archives 1853-1877, inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register in 2023.

Archives New Zealand does not solely collect government records. In fact, the institution also collects a wide range of materials that document New Zealand&#x27;s social, cultural, and economic history. This includes personal papers, community archives, and business records, as well as photographs, audiovisual materials, maps, and other types of records. Personal papers are one example of the non-government records held by Archives New Zealand. These papers may include diaries, letters, and photographs that provide a glimpse into the everyday lives of New Zealanders in different periods of history.

Community archives are another type of non-government record held by Archives New Zealand. These archives may include records of local organisations and events, such as sports clubs, churches, and community groups, that reflect the social and cultural diversity of New Zealand.

Business records are also held by Archives New Zealand, and these documents provide insight into the development of key industries and sectors in New Zealand, such as agriculture, forestry, and manufacturing.

Archives New Zealand&#x27;s collection of non-government records is an important resource for researchers, historians, and the wider public, and it contributes to the preservation and promotion of New Zealand&#x27;s cultural heritage.

=== Finding records held ===
Researchers can search descriptions of the records using Archway, an online database of records held at Archives New Zealand. Archives New Zealand has developed preservation programs and facilities to ensure that records are protected from damage and degradation. The organisation collaborates with the National Library of New Zealand and other cultural heritage institutions to digitize and provide access to a wide range of digital content.

=== Physical records access ===
Access to holdings is available through four reading rooms in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, and through a remote reference service. 110,205 linear metres of physical archives were held in storage as at June 2018.

While most records held by Archives New Zealand are open to the public, some access restrictions may apply based on factors such as the sensitivity of the information and the privacy of individuals.

In addition to preserving and providing access to historical records, Archives New Zealand also works with government agencies to manage their records. This includes providing guidance on record-keeping practices, developing standards for records management, and overseeing the transfer of records to Archives New Zealand for preservation and access.

=== Digitised records ===
In 2019 Archives New Zealand forged a new partnership with Swedish firm Axiell Collections who will be managing their digital collection. This is a key partnership, as Axiell are known as a leading software supplier in the archives sector. A mantra of theirs is that culture should be preserved, shared and accessible through high quality systems. This was a key reason for Archives New Zealand moving from their previous system (Archway) to Axiell Collections: so that employees can become more efficient, as well as New Zealanders having enhanced access to New Zealand’s archives and taonga.

Unfortunately, in late 2022, there were security breaches of which Axiell has formally apologised for. This was due to technology failings, in conjunction with data entry errors, leading to a shutdown of the system for multiple days on multiple occasions. The security breach entailed public members being able to access restricted files through the new system, with 9000 files opened to being exposed. The files were related to the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Abuse in Care. In particular they were three sets of health records in a 21-year period from 1952, from a mental health facility in Canterbury. As stated, Axiell has issued a formal apology and are pouring significant resources into fixing the situation.

Digital records are also available via DigitalNZ. A selection of records are also available on Archives New Zealand&#x27;s social media channels, including YouTube and Flickr.

Examples of digitised records available:

* New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) Personnel Files from the First World War – over 141,000 service files digitised.
* New Zealand Official War Art Collection.
* Crown Purchase Deeds.
* Māori (native) school records and,
* Samoan Land Deeds – Series 18962.

For a details of what is digitised by topic see Archives New Zealand&#x27;s website.

== Exhibitions ==

===He Tohu exhibition===

In May 2017, a new permanent archive exhibition &quot;He Tohu,&quot; opened at the National Library of New Zealand building on Molesworth Street, Wellington.

&quot;He Tohu&quot; is an exhibition of three of New Zealand&#x27;s most significant constitutional documents:

== Associated Organisations ==

=== Archives and Records Association of New Zealand (ARANZ) – Te Huinga Mahara ===
Prior to its establishment in 1976, ARANZ was a part of the New Zealand Library Association (NZLA). At this point in time, the NZLA contained a mix of historians, genealogists, librarians and archivists, however, there was a need voiced by archivists to become more focused on their speciality. This was the catalyst for the creation of this organisation. The original thought was that it should be open to public, serving as more of an interest group rather than limiting membership to archive professionals only. This is the form that remains to this day.

ARANZ are an incorporated society that are a key stakeholder in the archive sector. Members include professional organisations, historians and of course: archivists. There are a variety of reasons why ARANZ are a significant partner for Archives New Zealand (as well as similar organisations). Namely, ARANZ serves as a leader regarding best industry practice for care, preservation, and administration of historical records; they hold an advocacy role for the sector which includes submissions to government regarding enhancements to existing legislation; a further role includes facilitating employee upskilling through shared knowledge as well advisory duties to appropriate educational facilities; and they produce regular publications and reports to facilitate these functions.

Overall, due to ARANZ and their role as a key stakeholder in the sector, Archives New Zealand is supported in achieving their objectives outlined in the Public Records Act 2005. Amongst other roles, these are: maintaining stewardship of public records; ensuring records of government decision making are stored appropriately with the intention of long-term sustainability at the forefront of this function; ensuring records with long term value are transferred into its service; providing recordkeeping advice and information to government departments; making sure public archives are accessible to government, other organisations as well as the public; managing public archives in a protected and secure environment; and the provision of leadership and advocacy within the sector.

<doc id="182194" wikidata="Q217452" url="?curid=182194" title="Vézelay Abbey">
<text>Vézelay Abbey () is a Benedictine and Cluniac monastery in Vézelay in the east-central French department of Yonne. It was constructed between 1120 and 1150. The Benedictine abbey church, now the Basilica of Sainte-Marie-Madeleine (Saint Mary Magdalene), with its complex program of imagery in sculpted capitals and portals, is one of the great masterpieces of Burgundian Romanesque art and architecture. Sacked by the Huguenots in 1569, the building suffered neglect in the 17th and the 18th centuries and some further damage during the period of the French Revolution.

The church and hill at Vézelay were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1979 because of their importance in medieval Christianity and outstanding architecture.

Relics of Mary Magdalene can be seen inside the Basilica.

== History ==
The Benedictine abbey of Vézelay was founded, as many abbeys were, on land that had been a late Roman villa, of Vercellus (&quot;Vercelle&quot; becoming &quot;Vézelay&quot;). The villa had passed into the hands of the Carolingians and devolved to a Carolingian count, Girart, of Roussillon. The two convents he founded there were looted and dispersed by Moorish raiding parties in the 8th century, and a hilltop convent was burnt by Norman raiders. In the 9th century, the abbey was refounded under the guidance of Badilo, who became an affiliate of the reformed Benedictine order of Cluny. Vézelay also stood at the beginning of one of the four major routes through France for pilgrims going to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia, in the north-western corner of Spain.

About 1050 the monks of Vézelay began to claim to hold the relics of Mary Magdalene, brought, they said, from the Holy Land either by their 9th-century founder-saint, Badilo, or by envoys despatched by him. A little later a monk of Vézelay declared that he had detected in a crypt at St-Maximin in Provence, carved on an empty sarcophagus, a representation of the Unction at Bethany, when Jesus&#x27; head was anointed by Mary of Bethany, who was assumed in the Middle Ages to be Mary Magdalene. The monks of Vézelay pronounced this to be Mary Magdalene&#x27;s tomb, from which her relics had been translated to their abbey. Freed captives then brought their chains as votive objects to the abbey, and it was the newly elected Abbot Geoffroy in 1037 who had the ironwork melted down and reforged as wrought iron railings surrounding the Magdalene&#x27;s altar. Thus the erection of one of the finest examples of Romanesque architecture which followed was made possible by pilgrims to the declared relics and these tactile examples demonstrating the efficacy of prayers. Mary Magdalene is the prototype of the penitent, and Vézelay has remained an important place of pilgrimage for the Catholic faithful, though the actual claimed relics were torched by Huguenots in the 16th century.

To accommodate the influx of pilgrims a new abbey church was begun, dedicated on April 21, 1104, but the expense of building so increased the tax burden on the abbey&#x27;s lands that the peasants rose up and killed the abbot. The crush of pilgrims was such that an extended narthex (an enclosed porch) was built, inaugurated by Pope Innocent II in 1132, to help accommodate the pilgrim throng.

Saint Bernard of Clairvaux preached at Vézelay in favor of a second crusade at Easter 1146, in front of King Louis VII. Richard I of England and Philip II of France met there and spent three months at the Abbey in 1190 before leaving for the Third Crusade. Thomas Becket, in exile, chose Vézelay for his Whitsunday sermon in 1166, announcing the excommunication of the main supporters of his English King, Henry II, and threatening the King with excommunication too. The nave, which had been burnt once, with great loss of life, burned again in 1165, after which it was rebuilt in its present form.

The abbey&#x27;s self-assured monastic community was prepared to defend its liberties and privileges against all comers: the bishops of Autun, who challenged its claims to exemption; the counts of Nevers, who claimed jurisdiction in their court and rights of hospitality at Vézelay; the abbey of Cluny, which had reformed its rule and sought to maintain control of the abbot within its hierarchy; the townsmen of Vézelay, who demanded a modicum of communal self-government.

The beginning of Vézelay&#x27;s decline coincided with the well-publicized discovery in 1279 of the body of Mary Magdalene at Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume in Provence, given regal patronage by Charles II, the Angevin king of Sicily. When Charles erected a Dominican convent at La Sainte-Baume, the shrine was found intact, with an explanatory inscription stating why the relics had been hidden. The local Dominican friars compiled an account of miracles that these relics had wrought. This discovery undermined Vézelay&#x27;s position as the principal shrine of the Magdalene in Europe.

After the Revolution, Vézelay stood in danger of collapse. In 1834 the newly appointed French inspector of historical monuments, Prosper Mérimée (more familiar as the author of &quot;Carmen&quot;), warned that it was about to collapse, and on his recommendation the young architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc was appointed to supervise a massive and successful restoration, undertaken in several stages between 1840 and 1861, during which his team replaced a great deal of the weathered and vandalized sculpture. The flying buttresses that support the nave are his.

== Interpretation of the tympanum ==
The tympanum of the central portal of the &quot;Madeleine de Vézelay&quot; is different from its counterparts across Europe. From the beginning, its tympanum was specifically designed to function as a spiritual defense of the Crusades and to portray a Christian allegory to the Crusaders&#x27; mission. When compared to contemporary churches such as St. Lazare d&#x27;Autun and St. Pierre de Moissac, the distinctiveness of Vézelay becomes apparent.

The art historian George Zarnecki wrote, &quot;To most people the term Romanesque sculpture brings to mind a large church portal, dominated by a tympanum carved with an apocalyptic vision, usually the Last Judgment.&quot; This is true in most cases, but Vézelay is an exception. In a 1944 article, Adolf Katzenellenbogen interpreted Vézelay&#x27;s tympanum as referring to the First Crusade and depicting the Pentecostal mission of the Apostles.

Thirty years before the Vézelay tympanum was carved, Pope Urban II planned on announcing his call for a crusade at La Madeleine. In 1095, Urban altered his plans and preached for the First Crusade at the Council of Clermont, but Vézelay remained a central figure in the history of the crusades. The tympanum was completed in 1130. Fifteen years after its completion, Bernard of Clairvaux chose Vézelay as the place from which he would call for a Second Crusade. Vézelay was even the staging point for the Third Crusade. It is there that King Richard the Lionheart of England and King Philip Augustus of France met and joined their armies for a combined western invasion of the holy land. It is appropriate, therefore, that Vézelay&#x27;s portal reflect its place in the history of the crusades.

The art historian Peter Low argues for the central tympanum as a visualization of both the Pentecost and a passage from book of Ephesians chapter 2—proclaiming to the visiting laity the tenets of Benedictine monasticism and to visiting pilgrims the extent and reach of a universalizing church that welcomes &quot;the full, even monstrous range of the globe&#x27;s inhabitants.&quot;

=== Lintel ===
The lintel of the Vézelay portal portrays the &quot;ungodly&quot; people of the world. It is a depiction of the first Pentecostal Mission to spread the word of God to all the people of the world. The figures in the tympanum who have not received the Word of God are depicted as not fully human. Some are shown with pig snouts, others are misshapen, and several are depicted as dwarves. One pygmy in particular is depicted as mounting a horse with the assistance of a ladder. On the far right, there is a man with elephantine ears, while in the center we see a man covered in feathers. The architects and artisans depicted the unbelievers as physically grotesque in order to provide a visual image of what they saw as the non-believers&#x27; moral turpitude. This is a direct reflection of Western perceptions of foreigners such as the Moors, who were being specifically targeted by the Crusaders. Even Pope Urban II, in his call for a crusade, helped promote this ethnocentric perception of the Turks by calling on westerners to, &quot;exterminate this vile race.&quot; Most Westerners had absolutely no idea what the Turks and Muslims looked like, and they assumed that an absence of Christianity must coincide with repulsive physical attributes. It has also been argued that the disbelievers were carved as deformed monsters in an effort to dehumanize them. By dehumanizing their enemies in art, the Crusaders&#x27; mission to capture the holy land and convert or kill the Muslims was glorified and sanctified. The Vézelay lintel is, therefore, a political statement as well as a religious one.

=== Comparison with other contemporary portals ===
Vézelay&#x27;s political motivation becomes all the more apparent when compared with contemporary portal designs from other churches around France. The Vézelay lintel is distinct, but some comparisons can be made between it and other Romanesque portal sculptures of the time. Vézelay&#x27;s lintel is comparable to the St. Lazare lintel in Autun in that both show humans who have sinned. While the Vézelay lintel is devoted to the depiction of &quot;heathens,&quot; the Autun lintel shows the damned souls on Judgment Day. The similarity between both lintels is due in large part to the fact that the same master artisan, Master Gislebertus, was the primary architect on both sites. &quot;Gislebertus ... began his career at Cluny, then worked on the original west facade at Vézelay, and c. 1120 moved to Autun.&quot; In addition, the two tympana are similar in that they follow the tradition of placing the exaggerated Christ in the center of the image. Here is where the similarity stops, however. Autun is more traditional and typical of the Romanesque portal carvings. It depicts the Second Coming, which is a popular and typical depiction in Romanesque art. Frightful images of demons abound. The goals of the two different tympana are reflected in their design; Autun is designed to frighten people back to church while Vézelay is designed as a political statement to support the crusades.

=== Lower compartments ===
The lower four compartments of the Vézelay tympanum show the nations that had already received the Gospels. They include the Byzantines, Armenians, and Ethiopians. The inclusion of the Byzantines is particularly important because it was the Byzantines who initially requested a Crusade to the holy land. The Byzantines had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuk Turks through warfare, and they were eager to seek western military support to reclaim that territory.

The characters in the lower Vézelay compartments are regal and well proportioned. They are a direct contrast to their &quot;heathen&quot; counterparts in the lintel. They are human as opposed to monstrous. In the eyes of the designers, they had received God&#x27;s grace and are thus pictured as fully human in every detail. These compartments can, therefore, can be seen as an allegory for the crusading nations. The Crusader armies were made up of many different nationalities bound only by faith in the same God. Nations that had previously warred with one another were suddenly united for a common goal. The lower tympanum compartments are an expression of this newfound solidarity.

=== Upper compartments ===
While the lower four compartments represent the Christian nations, the upper four compartments are a representation of the second mission of the Apostles. According to the Bible, &quot;many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.&quot; These wonders included the healing of the sick and the casting out of demons and devils. These acts are represented in the upper four compartments of the Vézelay tympanum. In one compartment, a pair of lepers is shown with looks of astonishment as they compare limbs that have been miraculously healed. The demons are analogous to the non-Christians inhabiting the holy land. In reference to the Turkish take-over of the holy lands, Pope Urban said, &quot;What a disgrace that a race so despicable, degenerate, and enslaved by demons should thus overcome a people endowed with faith in Almighty God!&quot; It is not difficult to see the parallel between the Apostles&#x27; mission of casting out demons, and the designer&#x27;s view of the crusaders&#x27; mission of casting out &quot;a race ... enslaved by demons.&quot; It is further evidence of the Vézelay portal&#x27;s peculiar political motives.

=== Central portal ===

The central portion of the Vézelay tympanum continues this process of politicizing religion. The central tympanum shows a benevolent Christ conveying his message to the Apostles, who flank him on either side. This Christ is distinct in Romanesque architecture. He is a stark contrast to the angry Christ of the St. Pierre de Moissac tympanum. The Moissac Christ is a forbidding figure that sits upon the throne of judgment. It is another example of the typical Romanesque Christ. His face is without caring or emotion. He holds the scrolls containing the deeds of mankind, and he stands ready to execute punishment on the damned. The Vézelay Christ, however, is pictured contraposto with arms wide. He is delivering a message, not exacting punishment. The Vézelay tympanum is remarkable because it is so different. The Vézelay Christ is sending the Crusaders outhe is not judging them. Indeed, the Crusaders were guaranteed remission of all sins if they participated in the Crusades. A forbidding Christ placed upon the throne of judgment would have been out of place at Vézelay. That is why the traditional Romanesque Christ, with its angry stare, was replaced at Vézelay by a kind and welcoming Christ with arms wide open.

== Astronomical alignment ==

In 1976, Hugues Delautre, one of the Franciscan fathers charged with stewardship of the Vézelay sanctuary, discovered that beyond the customary east-west orientation of the structure, the architecture of La Madeleine incorporates the relative positions of the Earth and the Sun into its design. Every June, just before the feast day of Saint John the Baptist, the astronomical dimensions of the church are revealed as the sun reaches its highest point of the year, at local noon on the summer solstice, when the sunlight coming through the southern clerestory windows casts a series of illuminated spots precisely along the longitudinal center of the nave floor.

<text>Differential heat treatment (also called selective heat treatment or local heat treatment) is a technique used during heat treating of steel to harden or soften certain areas of an object, creating a difference in hardness between these areas. There are many techniques for creating a difference in properties, but most can be defined as either &quot;differential hardening&quot; or &quot;differential tempering&quot;. These were common heat treatment techniques used historically in Europe and Asia, with possibly the most widely known example being from Japanese swordsmithing. Some modern varieties were developed in the twentieth century as metallurgical knowledge and technology rapidly increased.

Differential hardening is done by either of two methods. One of them is heating the steel evenly to a red-hot temperature and then cooling part of it quickly, turning that part into very hard martensite while the rest cools more slowly and becomes softer pearlite. The other is heating only part of the steel very quickly to red-hot and then rapidly cooling it by quenching, again turning that part into martensite, but leaving the rest unchanged. Conversely, one may selectively harden steel by differential tempering, that is, by heating it evenly to red-hot and then quenching it, turning it into martensite, and then tempering part of it by heating it to a much lower temperature, softening only that part.

==Introduction==
Differential heat treatment is a method used to alter the properties of various parts of a steel object differently, producing areas that are harder or softer than others. This creates greater toughness in the parts of the object where it is needed, such as the tang or spine of a sword, but produces greater hardness at the edge or other areas where greater impact resistance, wear resistance, and strength is needed. Differential heat treatment can often make certain areas harder than could be allowed if the steel was uniformly treated, or &quot;through treated&quot;. There are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel, but they can usually be divided into &quot;differential hardening&quot; and &quot;differential tempering&quot; methods.

During heat treating, when red-hot steel (usually between and ) is quenched, it becomes very hard. However, it will be too hard, becoming very brittle like glass. Quenched-steel is usually heated again, slowly and evenly (usually between and ) in a process called tempering, to soften the metal, thereby increasing the toughness. However, although this softening of the metal makes the blade less prone to breaking, it makes the edge more susceptible to deformation such as dulling, peening, or curling.

&quot;Differential hardening&quot; is a method used in heat treating swords and knives to increase the hardness of the edge without making the whole blade brittle. To achieve this, the edge is cooled faster than the spine by adding a heat insulator to the spine before quenching. Clay or another material is used for insulation. To prevent cracking and loss of surface carbon, quenching is usually performed before beveling, shaping, and sharpening the edge.
 It can also be achieved by carefully pouring water (perhaps already heated) onto the edge of a blade as is the case with the manufacture of some kukri. Differential hardening technology originated in China and later spread to Korea and Japan. This technique is mainly used in later Chinese jian, Chinese dao, and the katana, the traditional Japanese sword, and the khukuri, the traditional Nepalese knife. Most blades made with this technique have visible temper lines. Earlier Chinese jian from the ancient era (eg. Warring States to Han dynasty) used tempering rather than differential heat treatment. This method is sometimes called differential tempering, but this term more accurately refers to a different technique, which originated with the broadswords of Europe.

Modern versions of differential hardening were developed when sources of rapidly heating the metal were devised, such as an oxy-acetylene torch or induction heating. With flame hardening and induction hardening techniques, the steel is quickly heated to red-hot in a localized area and then quenched. This hardens only part of the object, but leaves the rest unaltered.

&quot;Differential tempering&quot; was more commonly used to make cutting tools, although it was sometimes used on knives and swords as well. Differential tempering is obtained by quenching the sword uniformly, then tempering one part of it, such as the spine or the center portion of double edged blades. This is usually done with a torch or some other directed heat source. The heated portion of the metal is softened by this process, leaving the edge at the higher hardness.

==Differential hardening==

===Bladesmithing===

Differential hardening (also called differential quenching, selective quenching, selective hardening, or local hardening) is most commonly used in bladesmithing to increase the toughness of a blade while keeping very high hardness and strength at the edge. This helps to make the blade very resistant to breaking, by making the spine very soft and bendable, but allows greater hardness at the edge than would be possible if the blade was uniformly quenched and tempered. This helps to create a tough blade that will maintain a very sharp, wear-resistant edge, even during rough use such as found in combat.

====Insulation coatings====
A differentially hardened blade will usually be coated with an insulating layer, like clay, but leaving the edge exposed. When it is heated to red-hot and quenched, the edge cools quickly, becoming very hard, but the rest cools slowly, becoming much softer. The insulation layer is quite often a mixture of clays, ashes, polishing stone powder, and salts, which protects the back of the blade from cooling very quickly when quenched. The clay is often applied by painting it on, coating the blade very thickly around the center and spine, but leaving the edge exposed. This allows the edge to cool very quickly, turning it into a very hard microstructure called martensite, but causes the rest of the blade to cool slowly, turning it into a soft microstructure called pearlite. This produces an edge that is exceptionally hard and brittle, but is backed-up by softer, tougher metal. The edge, however, will usually be too hard, so after quenching the entire blade is usually tempered to around for a short time, to bring the hardness of the edge down to around HRc60 on the Rockwell hardness scale.

The exact composition of the clay mixture, the thickness of the coating, and even the temperature of the water were often closely guarded secrets of the various bladesmithing schools. With the clay mixture, the main goal was to find a mixture that would withstand high temperatures and adhere to the blade without shrinking, cracking, or peeling as it dried. Sometimes the back of the blade was coated with clay, leaving the edge exposed. Other times the entire blade was coated and then the clay was cut away from the edge. Another method was to apply the clay thickly at the back but thinly at the edge, providing a lesser amount of insulation. By controlling the thickness of the edge-coating along with the temperature of the water, the cooling rate of each part of the blade can be controlled to produce the proper hardness upon quenching without the need for further tempering.

====Quenching====

Once the coating has dried, the blade is heated slowly and evenly, to prevent the coating from cracking or falling off. After the blade is heated to the proper temperature, which is usually judged by the cherry-red glow (blackbody radiation) of the blade, it will change into a phase called austenite. Both to help prevent cracking and to produce uniformity in the hardness of each area, the smith will need to ensure that the temperature is even, lacking any hot spots from sitting next to the coals. To prevent this, the blade is usually kept in motion while heating, to distribute the heat more evenly. Quenching is often done in low-light conditions, to help accurately judge the color of the glow. Typically, the smith will also try to avoid overheating the blade to prevent the metallic crystals from growing too large. At this time the blade will usually be plunged into a vat of water or oil, to quickly remove the heat from the edge. The clay, in turn, insulates the back of the blade, causing it to cool slower than the edge.

When the edge cools fast a diffusionless transformation occurs, turning the austenite into very hard martensite. This requires a temperature drop from around 750 °C (cherry-red) to 450 °C (at which point the transformation is complete) in less than a second to prevent the formation of soft pearlite. Because the rest of the blade cools slowly, the carbon in the austenite has time to precipitate, becoming pearlite. The diffusionless transformation causes the edge to &quot;freeze&quot; suddenly in a thermally expanded state, but allows the back to contract as it cools slower. This typically causes the blade to bend or curve during quenching, as the back contracts more than the edge. This gives swords like katana and wakizashi their characteristic curved shapes. The blade is usually straight when heated but then bows as it cools; first curving toward the edge as it contracts, and then away from the edge as the spine contracts more. With slashing-type swords, this curvature helps to facilitate cutting, but increases the chances of cracking during the procedure. Up to one third of all swords are ruined during the quenching process. However, when the sword does not crack, the internal stresses created help increase the toughness of the blade, similar to the increased toughness in tempered glass. The sword may need further shaping after quenching and tempering, to achieve the desired curvature.

Care must be taken to plunge the sword quickly and vertically (edge first), for if one side enters the quenching fluid before the other the cooling may be asymmetric and cause the blade to bend sideways (warp). Because quenching in water tends to cause a sudden loss of surface carbon, the sword will usually be quenched before the edge is beveled and sharpened. After quenching and tempering, the blade was traditionally given a rough shape with a metal-cutting draw knife (&quot;sen&quot;) before sending to a polisher for sharpening, although in modern times an electric belt sander is often used instead.

====Metallography====
Differential hardening will produce two different zones of hardness, which respond differently to grinding, sharpening, and polishing. The back and center of the blade will grind away much quicker than the edge, so the polisher will need to carefully control the angle of the edge, which will affect the geometry of the blade. An inexperienced polisher can quickly ruin a blade by applying too much pressure to the softened areas, rapidly altering the blade&#x27;s shape without much change to the hardened zone.
Although both the pearlite and martensite can be polished to a mirror-like shine, only the back and spine are usually polished to such an extent. The hardened portion of the blade (yakiba) and the center portion (hira) are often given a matte finish instead, to make the differences in the hardness stand out. This causes the various microstructures to reflect light differently when viewed from different angles. The pearlite takes on longer, deeper scratches, and either appears shiny and bright, or sometimes dark depending on the viewing angle. The martensite is harder to scratch, so the microscopic abrasions are smaller. The martensite usually appears brighter yet flatter than the pearlite, and this is less dependent on the viewing angle. When polished or etched with acid to reveal these features, a distinct boundary is observed between the martensite portion of the blade and the pearlite. This boundary is often called the &quot;temper line&quot;, or the commonly used Japanese term, the &quot;hamon&quot;. Between the hardened edge and the hamon lies an intermediate zone, called the &#x27;&quot;nioi&quot; in Japanese, which is usually only visible at long angles. The nioi is about a millimeter or two wide, following the hamon, which is made up of individual martensite grains (niye) surrounded by pearlite. The nioi provides a very tough boundary between the yakiba and the hira.

====Decorative hardening====
In Japan, from the legendary time of the famous smith Amakuni, hamons were originally straight and parallel to the edge, but by the twelfth century AD, smiths such as Shintogo Kunimitsu began producing hamons with very irregular shapes, which provided both mechanical and decorative benefits. By the sixteenth century AD, the Japanese smiths often overheated their swords slightly before quenching, to produce rather large niye for aesthetic purposes, even though a larger grain size tended to weaken the sword a bit. During this time, great attention began to be paid in Japan to making decorative hamons, by carefully shaping the clay. It became very common during this era to find swords with wavy hamons, flowers or clovers depicted in the temper line, rat&#x27;s feet, trees, or other shapes. By the eighteenth century, decorative hamons were often being combined with decorative folding techniques to produce entire landscapes, complete with specific islands, crashing waves, hills, mountains, rivers, and sometimes low spots were cut in the clay to produce niye far away from the hamon, creating effects such as birds in the sky.

====Benefits and drawbacks====
Although differential hardening produces a very hard edge, it also leaves the rest of the sword rather soft, which can make it prone to bending under heavy loads, such as parrying a hard blow. It can also make the edge more susceptible to chipping or cracking. Swords of this type can usually only be resharpened a few times before reaching the softer metal underneath the edge. However, if properly protected and maintained, these blades can usually hold an edge for long periods of time, even after slicing through bone and flesh, or heavily matted bamboo to simulate cutting through body parts, as is in iaido.

==Modern differential hardening==

===Flame hardening===

Flame hardening is often used to harden only a portion of an object, by quickly heating it with a very hot flame in a localized area, and then quenching the steel. This turns the heated portion into very hard martensite, but leaves the rest unchanged. Usually, an oxy-gas torch is used to provide such high temperatures. Flame hardening is a very common surface hardening technique, which is often used to provide a very wear-resistant surface. A common use is for hardening the surface of gears, making the teeth more resistant to erosion. The gear will usually be quenched and tempered to a specific hardness first, making a majority of the gear tough, and then the teeth are quickly heated and immediately quenched, hardening only the surface. Afterward, it may or may not be tempered again to achieve the final differential hardness.

This process is often used for knife making, by heating only the edge of a previously quenched and tempered blade. When edge turns the proper color temperature, it is quenched, hardening only the edge, but leaving most of the rest of the blade at the lower hardness. The knife is then tempered again to produce the final differential hardness. However, unlike a blade that has been evenly heated and differentially quenched, flame hardening creates a heat-affected zone. Unlike the nioi, the boundary between the hot and cold metal formed by this heat-affected zone causes extremely rapid cooling when quenched. When combined with the stresses formed, this creates a very brittle zone between the hard and softer metal, which usually makes this method unsuitable for swords or tools that may be subjected to shear and impact stresses.

===Induction hardening===

Induction hardening is a surface hardening technique which uses induction coils to provide a very rapid means of heating the metal. With induction heating, the steel can be heated very quickly to red-hot at the surface, before the heat can penetrate any distance into the metal. The surface is then quenched, hardening it, and is often used without further tempering. This makes the surface very resistant to wear, but provides tougher metal directly underneath it, leaving the majority of the object unchanged. A common use for induction hardening is for hardening the bearing surfaces, or &quot;journals&quot;, on automotive crankshafts or the rods of hydraulic cylinders.

==Differential tempering==
Differential tempering (also called graded tempering, selective tempering or local tempering) is the inverse of differential hardening, to ultimately produce similar results. Differential tempering begins by taking steel that has been uniformly quenched and hardened, and then heating it in localized areas to reduce the hardness. The process is often used in blacksmithing for tempering cutting instruments, softening the back, shaft, or spine, but simultaneously tempering the edge to a very high hardness. The process was very common in ancient Europe, for making tools, but soon was applied to knives and swords as well.

===Blacksmithing===
The most common use for differential tempering was for heat treating cutting tools, such as axes and chisels, where an extremely hard edge is desired, but some malleability and springiness is needed in the rest of the tool. A chisel with a very hard edge can maintain that edge longer and cut harder materials, but, if the entire chisel was too hard, it would shatter under the hammer blows. Differential tempering was often used to provide a very hard cutting edge, but to soften parts of the tool that are subject to impact and shock loading.

Before a tool is differentially tempered, it is first heated to red-hot and then quenched, hardening the entire tool. This makes the tool much too hard for normal use, so the tool is tempered to reduce the hardness to a more suitable point. However, unlike normal tempering, the tool is not heated evenly. Instead, the heat is applied to only a part of the tool, allowing the heat to thermally conduct toward the cooler cutting edge. The quenched-steel is first sanded or polished, to remove any residual oxidation, revealing the bare metal underneath. The steel is then heated in a localized area, such as the hammering-end of a chisel or the handle-end of an axe. The smith then carefully gauges the temperature by watching the tempering colors of the steel. As the steel is heated, these colors will form, ranging from yellow to brown, purple, and blue, and many shades in between, and will indicate the temperature of the steel. As heat is applied, the colors will form near the heat source, and then slowly move across the tool, following the heat as it conducts toward the edge.

Before the yellow or &quot;light-straw&quot; color reaches the edge, the smith removes the heat. The heat will continue to conduct, moving the colors toward the edge for a short time after the heat is removed. When the light-straw color reaches the edge, the smith will usually dip the steel in water, to stop the process. This will generally produce a very hard edge, around HRc58-60 on the Rockwell scale, but will leave the opposite end of the tool much softer. The hardness of the cutting edge is generally controlled by the chosen color, but will also be affected primarily by the carbon content in the steel, plus a variety of other factors. The exact hardness of the soft end depends on many factors, but the main one is the speed at which the steel was heated, or how far the colors spread out. The light-straw color is very hard, brittle steel, but the light-blue is softer and very springy. Beyond the blue color, when the steel turns grey, it is more likely to be very malleable, which is usually undesirable in a chisel. If the steel is too soft it can bend or mushroom, plastically deforming under the force of the hammer.

====Grade of temper====
Unlike with differential hardening, in differential tempering there is no distinct boundary between the harder and softer metals, but the change from hard to soft is very gradual, forming a continuum, or &quot;grade&quot; (gradient), of hardness. However, higher heating temperatures cause the colors to spread less, creating a much steeper grade, while lower temperatures can make the change more gradual, using a smaller portion of the entire continuum. The tempering colors only represent a fraction of the entire grade, because the metal turns grey above , making it difficult to judge the temperature, but the hardness will continue to decrease as the temperature rises.

====Guiding the heat====
Heating in just one area, like the flat end of a center punch, will cause the grade to spread evenly down the length of the tool. Because having a continuous grade along the length of the entire tool is not always desired, methods of concentrating the change have been devised. A tool like a chisel may be heated quickly but evenly along the entire shaft, tempering it to a purple or blue color, but allowing the residual heat to quickly conduct a short distance to the edge. Another method is to hold the edge in water, keeping it cool as the rest of the tool is tempered. When the proper color is reached, the edge is removed from the water and allowed to temper from the residual heat, and the entire tool is plunged in the water when the edge turns the proper color. However, heating in localized areas with such low temperatures may be difficult with larger items, like an axe or a splitting maul, because the steel may lose too much heat before it can conduct to the edge. Sometimes the steel is heated evenly to just below the desired temperature, and then differentially tempered, making it easier to control the temperature change. Another way is to partially embed the steel in an insulator, like sand or lime, preventing too much heat loss during tempering.

===Bladesmithing===
Eventually, this process was applied to swords and knives, to produce mechanical effects that were similar to differential hardening, but with some important differences. To differentially temper a blade, it is first quenched to harden the entire blade evenly. The blade is then heated in a localized area, allowing the heat to flow toward the edge. With single-edged blades, the blade may be tempered with fire or a torch. The blade is heated along the spine and tang only, allowing the heat to conduct to the edge. The heat will need to be applied evenly, allowing the colors to spread evenly across the blade. However, with double-edged blades, the heat source will usually need to be more precisely localized because the heat must be applied evenly along the center of the blade, allowing it to conduct to both edges. Often, a red or yellow-hot bar is used to supply the heat, placing it along the center of the blade, typically fitted into a fuller. Modern gas torches often have the ability to produce very precise flames. To prevent too much heat loss in the blade, it may be preheated, partially insulated, or sandwiched between two red-hot bars. When the proper color reaches the edge, it is immersed in water to stop the process.

====Guiding the heat====
Differential tempering can be made more difficult by the shape of the blade. When tempering a double-edged sword with a taper along its length, the tip may reach the proper temperature before the shank does. The smith may need to control the temperature by using methods like pouring water along certain parts of the edge, or cooling it with ice, causing the proper temperature to reach the entire edge at the same time. In this way, although it is less time-consuming than differential hardening with clay, once the process starts the smith must be vigilant, carefully guiding the heat. This leaves little room for error, and mistakes in shaping the hardened zone cannot easily be corrected. This is made even more difficult if the knife or sword has a curve, an odd shape, or a sharply tapered tip. Swords tempered in this manner, especially double-edged swords, will generally need to be rather wide, allowing room for a gradient to form. However differential tempering does not alter the blade&#x27;s shape.

====Metallurgy====
When a sword, knife or tool is evenly quenched, the entire object turns into martensite, which is extremely hard, without the formation of soft pearlite. Tempering reduces the hardness in the steel by gradually changing the martensite into a microstructure of various carbides, such as cementite, and softer ferrite (iron), forming a microstructure called &quot;tempered martensite&quot;. When tempering high-carbon steel in the blacksmith method, the color provides a general indication of the final hardness, although some trial-and-error is usually required to match the right color to the type of steel to achieve the exact hardness, because the carbon content, the heating speed, and even the type of heat source will affect the outcome. Without the formation of pearlite, the steel can be incrementally tempered to achieve the proper hardness in each area, ensuring that no area is too soft. In arming swords, for instance, because the blade is typically rather wide and thin, a blade can be prone to bending during combat. If the center of the blade is too soft, this bending may likely be permanent. However, if the sword is tempered to a springy hardness, it will be more likely to return to its original shape.

====Benefits and drawbacks====
A sword tempered this way cannot usually have an edge as hard as a differentially-hardened sword, like a katana, because there is no softer metal directly underneath the edge to back-up the harder metal. This makes the edge more likely to chip away in larger pieces. Therefore, such an extremely hard edge is not always desirable, as greater hardness makes the edge more brittle and less resistant to impacts, such as cutting through bones, shafts of pole-arms, hitting shields or blocking and parrying. The sword will often be tempered to slightly higher temperatures to increase the impact resistance at a cost in the ability to hold a sharp edge when cutting. The edge may need to be tempered to dark-straw or brown to achieve this, and the center tempered to a blue or purple color. This may leave very little difference between the edge and the center, and the benefits of this method, over tempering the sword evenly at a point somewhere in the middle, may not be very substantial. When a sword tempered in this way is resharpened the hardness will decrease with each sharpening, although the reduction in hardness will usually not be noticeable until a large amount of steel has been removed.

<text>Forging is a manufacturing process involving the shaping of metal using localized compressive forces. The blows are delivered with a hammer (often a power hammer) or a die. Forging is often classified according to the temperature at which it is performed: cold forging (a type of cold working), warm forging, or hot forging (a type of hot working). For the latter two, the metal is heated, usually in a forge. Forged parts can range in weight from less than a kilogram to hundreds of metric tons. Forging has been done by smiths for millennia; the traditional products were kitchenware, hardware, hand tools, edged weapons, cymbals, and jewellery.

Since the Industrial Revolution, forged parts are widely used in mechanisms and machines wherever a component requires high strength; such forgings usually require further processing (such as machining) to achieve a finished part. Today, forging is a major worldwide industry.

==History==

Forging is one of the oldest known metalworking processes. Traditionally, forging was performed by a smith using hammer and anvil, though introducing water power to the production and working of iron in the 12th century allowed the use of large trip hammers or power hammers that increased the amount and size of iron that could be produced and forged. The smithy or forge has evolved over centuries to become a facility with engineered processes, production equipment, tooling, raw materials and products to meet the demands of modern industry.

In modern times, industrial forging is done either with presses or with hammers powered by compressed air, electricity, hydraulics or steam. These hammers may have reciprocating weights in the thousands of pounds. Smaller power hammers, or less reciprocating weight, and hydraulic presses are common in art smithies as well. Some steam hammers remain in use, but they became obsolete with the availability of the other, more convenient, power sources.

==Processes==

There are many different kinds of forging processes available; however, they can be grouped into three main classes:
*Drawn out: length increases, cross-section decreases
*Upset: length decreases, cross-section increases
*Squeezed in closed compression dies: produces multidirectional flow

Common forging processes include: roll forging, swaging, cogging, open-die forging, impression-die forging (closed die forging), press forging, cold forging, automatic hot forging and upsetting.

===Temperature===
All of the following forging processes can be performed at various temperatures; however, they are generally classified by whether the metal temperature is above or below the recrystallization temperature. If the temperature is above the material&#x27;s recrystallization temperature it is deemed &quot;hot forging&quot;; if the temperature is below the material&#x27;s recrystallization temperature but above 30% of the recrystallization temperature (on an absolute scale) it is deemed &quot;warm forging&quot;; if below 30% of the recrystallization temperature (usually room temperature) then it is deemed &quot;cold forging&quot;. The main advantage of hot forging is that it can be done more quickly and precisely, and as the metal is deformed work hardening effects are negated by the recrystallization process. Cold forging typically results in work hardening of the piece.

===Drop forging===
Drop forging is a forging process where a hammer is raised and then &quot;dropped&quot; into the workpiece to deform it according to the shape of the die. There are two types of drop forging: open-die drop forging and impression-die (or closed-die) drop forging. As the names imply, the difference is in the shape of the die, with the former not fully enclosing the workpiece, while the latter does.

====Open-die drop forging====
Open-die forging is also known as &quot;smith forging&quot;. In open-die forging, a hammer strikes and deforms the workpiece, which is placed on a stationary anvil. Open-die forging gets its name from the fact that the dies (the surfaces that are in contact with the workpiece) do not enclose the workpiece, allowing it to flow except where contacted by the dies. The operator therefore needs to orient and position the workpiece to get the desired shape. The dies are usually flat in shape, but some have a specially shaped surface for specialized operations. For example, a die may have a round, concave, or convex surface or be a tool to form holes or be a cut-off tool. Open-die forgings can be worked into shapes which include discs, hubs, blocks, shafts (including step shafts or with flanges), sleeves, cylinders, flats, hexes, rounds, plate, and some custom shapes. Open-die forging lends itself to short runs and is appropriate for art smithing and custom work. In some cases, open-die forging may be employed to rough-shape ingots to prepare them for subsequent operations. Open-die forging may also orient the grain to increase strength in the required direction.

====Advantages of open-die forging====
* Reduced chance of voids
* Better fatigue resistance
* Improved microstructure
* Continuous grain flow
* Finer grain size
* Greater strength
* Better response to thermal treatment
* Improvement of internal quality
* Greater reliability of mechanical properties, ductility and impact resistance
&quot;&quot; is the successive deformation of a bar along its length using an open-die drop forge. It is commonly used to work a piece of raw material to the proper thickness. Once the proper thickness is achieved the proper width is achieved via &quot;edging&quot;. &quot;&quot; is the process of concentrating material using a concave shaped open-die. The process is called &quot;edging&quot; because it is usually carried out on the ends of the workpiece. &quot;&quot; is a similar process that thins out sections of the forging using a convex shaped die. These processes prepare the workpieces for further forging processes.
====Impression-die forging====
Impression-die forging is also called &quot;closed-die forging&quot;. In impression-die forging, the metal is placed in a die resembling a mold, which is attached to an anvil. Usually, the hammer die is shaped as well. The hammer is then dropped on the workpiece, causing the metal to flow and fill the die cavities. The hammer is generally in contact with the workpiece on the scale of milliseconds. Depending on the size and complexity of the part, the hammer may be dropped multiple times in quick succession. Excess metal is squeezed out of the die cavities, forming what is referred to as &quot;flash&quot;. The flash cools more rapidly than the rest of the material; this cool metal is stronger than the metal in the die, so it helps prevent more flash from forming. This also forces the metal to completely fill the die cavity. After forging, the flash is removed.

In commercial impression-die forging, the workpiece is usually moved through a series of cavities in a die to get from an ingot to the final form. The first impression is used to distribute the metal into the rough shape in accordance to the needs of later cavities; this impression is called an &quot;edging&quot;, &quot;fullering&quot;, or &quot;bending&quot; impression. The following cavities are called &quot;blocking&quot; cavities, in which the piece is working into a shape that more closely resembles the final product. These stages usually impart the workpiece with generous bends and large fillets. The final shape is forged in a &quot;final&quot; or &quot;finisher&quot; impression cavity. If there is only a short run of parts to be done, then it may be more economical for the die to lack a final impression cavity and instead machine the final features.

Impression-die forging has been improved in recent years through increased automation which includes induction heating, mechanical feeding, positioning and manipulation, and the direct heat treatment of parts after forging. One variation of impression-die forging is called &quot;flashless forging&quot;, or &quot;true closed-die forging&quot;. In this type of forging, the die cavities are completely closed, which keeps the workpiece from forming flash. The major advantage to this process is that less metal is lost to flash. Flash can account for 20 to 45% of the starting material. The disadvantages of this process include additional cost due to a more complex die design and the need for better lubrication and workpiece placement.

There are other variations of part formation that integrate impression-die forging. One method incorporates casting a forging preform from liquid metal. The casting is removed after it has solidified, but while still hot. It is then finished in a single cavity die. The flash is trimmed, then the part is quench hardened. Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the preform is produced by the spraying deposition of metal droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).

Closed-die forging has a high initial cost due to the creation of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with greater production volume. This is one of the major reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally have about a 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.

===== Design of impression-die forgings and tooling =====
Forging dies are usually made of high-alloy or tool steel. Dies must be impact- and wear-resistant, maintain strength at high temperatures, and have the ability to withstand cycles of rapid heating and cooling. In order to produce a better, more economical die the following standards are maintained:
*The dies part along a single, flat plane whenever possible. If not, the parting plane follows the contour of the part.
*The parting surface is a plane through the center of the forging and not near an upper or lower edge.
*Adequate draft is provided; usually at least 3° for aluminium and 5° to 7° for steel.
*Generous fillets and radii are used.
*Ribs are low and wide.
*The various sections are balanced to avoid extreme difference in metal flow.
*Full advantage is taken of fiber flow lines.
*Dimensional tolerances are not closer than necessary.

Barrelling occurs when, due to friction between the work piece and the die or punch, the work piece bulges at its centre in such a way as to resemble a barrel. This leads to the central part of the work piece to come in contact with the sides of the die sooner than if there were no friction present, creating a much greater increase in the pressure required for the punch to finish the forging.

The dimensional tolerances of a steel part produced using the impression-die forging method are outlined in the table below. The dimensions across the parting plane are affected by the closure of the dies, and are therefore dependent on die wear and the thickness of the final flash. Dimensions that are completely contained within a single die segment or half can be maintained at a significantly greater level of accuracy.

A lubricant is used when forging to reduce friction and wear. It is also used as a thermal barrier to restrict heat transfer from the workpiece to the die. Finally, the lubricant acts as a parting compound to prevent the part from sticking in the dies.

===Press forging===
Press forging works by slowly applying a continuous pressure or force, which differs from the near-instantaneous impact of drop-hammer forging. The amount of time the dies are in contact with the workpiece is measured in seconds (as compared to the milliseconds of drop-hammer forges). The press forging operation can be done either cold or hot.

The main advantage of press forging, as compared to drop-hammer forging, is its ability to deform the complete workpiece. Drop-hammer forging usually only deforms the surfaces of the work piece in contact with the hammer and anvil; the interior of the workpiece will stay relatively undeformed. Another advantage to the process includes the knowledge of the new part&#x27;s strain rate. By controlling the compression rate of the press forging operation, the internal strain can be controlled.

There are a few disadvantages to this process, most stemming from the workpiece being in contact with the dies for such an extended period of time. The operation is a time-consuming process due to the amount and length of steps. The workpiece will cool faster because the dies are in contact with workpiece; the dies facilitate drastically more heat transfer than the surrounding atmosphere. As the workpiece cools it becomes stronger and less ductile, which may induce cracking if deformation continues. Therefore, heated dies are usually used to reduce heat loss, promote surface flow, and enable the production of finer details and closer tolerances. The workpiece may also need to be reheated.

When done in high productivity, press forging is more economical than hammer forging. The operation also creates closer tolerances. In hammer forging a lot of the work is absorbed by the machinery; when in press forging, the greater percentage of work is used in the work piece. Another advantage is that the operation can be used to create any size part because there is no limit to the size of the press forging machine. New press forging techniques have been able to create a higher degree of mechanical and orientation integrity. By the constraint of oxidation to the outer layers of the part, reduced levels of microcracking occur in the finished part.

Press forging can be used to perform all types of forging, including open-die and impression-die forging. Impression-die press forging usually requires less draft than drop forging and has better dimensional accuracy. Also, press forgings can often be done in one closing of the dies, allowing for easy automation.

===Upset forging===

Upset forging increases the diameter of the workpiece by compressing its length. Based on number of pieces produced, this is the most widely used forging process. A few examples of common parts produced using the upset forging process are engine valves, couplings, bolts, screws, and other fasteners.

Upset forging is usually done in special high-speed machines called &quot;crank presses&quot;. The machines are usually set up to work in the horizontal plane, to facilitate the quick exchange of workpieces from one station to the next, but upsetting can also be done in a vertical crank press or a hydraulic press. The initial workpiece is usually wire or rod, but some machines can accept bars up to in diameter and a capacity of over 1000 tons. The standard upsetting machine employs split dies that contain multiple cavities. The dies open enough to allow the workpiece to move from one cavity to the next; the dies then close and the heading tool, or ram, then moves longitudinally against the bar, upsetting it into the cavity. If all of the cavities are utilized on every cycle, then a finished part will be produced with every cycle, which makes this process advantageous for mass production.

These rules must be followed when designing parts to be upset forged:
*The length of unsupported metal that can be upset in one blow without injurious buckling should be limited to three times the diameter of the bar.
*Lengths of stock greater than three times the diameter may be upset successfully, provided that the diameter of the upset is not more than 1.5 times the diameter of the stock.
*In an upset requiring stock length greater than three times the diameter of the stock, and where the diameter of the cavity is not more than 1.5 times the diameter of the stock, the length of unsupported metal beyond the face of the die must not exceed the diameter of the bar.

===Automatic hot forging===
The automatic hot forging process involves feeding mill-length steel bars (typically long) into one end of the machine at room temperature and hot forged products emerge from the other end. This all occurs rapidly; small parts can be made at a rate of 180 parts per minute (ppm) and larger can be made at a rate of 90 ppm. The parts can be solid or hollow, round or symmetrical, up to , and up to in diameter. The main advantages to this process are its high output rate and ability to accept low-cost materials. Little labor is required to operate the machinery.

There is no flash produced so material savings are between 20 and 30% over conventional forging. The final product is a consistent so air cooling will result in a part that is still easily machinable (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±, surfaces are clean, and draft angles are 0.5 to 1°. Tool life is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 0.06-second. The downside is that this process is only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, so large quantities are required to justify this process.

The process starts by heating the bar to in less than 60 seconds using high-power induction coils. It is then descaled with rollers, sheared into blanks, and transferred through several successive forming stages, during which it is upset, preformed, final forged, and pierced (if necessary). This process can also be coupled with high-speed cold-forming operations. Generally, the cold forming operation will do the finishing stage so that the advantages of cold-working can be obtained, while maintaining the high speed of automatic hot forging.

Examples of parts made by this process are: wheel hub unit bearings, transmission gears, tapered roller bearing races, stainless steel coupling flanges, and neck rings for liquid propane (LP) gas cylinders. Manual transmission gears are an example of automatic hot forging used in conjunction with cold working.

===Roll forging===
Roll forging is a process where round or flat bar stock is reduced in thickness and increased in length. Roll forging is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves. A heated bar is inserted into the rolls and when it hits a spot the rolls rotate and the bar is progressively shaped as it is rolled through the machine. The piece is then transferred to the next set of grooves or turned around and reinserted into the same grooves. This continues until the desired shape and size is achieved. The advantage of this process is there is no flash and it imparts a favorable grain structure into the workpiece.

Examples of products produced using this method include axles, tapered levers and leaf springs.

===Net-shape and near-net-shape forging===

This process is also known as &quot;precision forging&quot;. It was developed to minimize cost and waste associated with post-forging operations. Therefore, the final product from a precision forging needs little or no final machining. Cost savings are gained from the use of less material, and thus less scrap, the overall decrease in energy used, and the reduction or elimination of machining. Precision forging also requires less of a draft, 1° to 0°. The downside of this process is its cost, therefore it is only implemented if significant cost reduction can be achieved.

====Cold forging====
Near net shape forging is most common when parts are forged without heating the slug, bar or billet. Aluminum is a common material that can be cold forged depending on final shape. Lubrication of the parts being formed is critical to increase the life of the mating dies.

===Induction forging===

Unlike the above processes, induction forging is based on the type of heating style used. Many of the above processes can be used in conjunction with this heating method.

===Multidirectional forging===
Multidirectional forging is forming of a work piece in a single step in several directions. The multidirectional forming takes place through constructive measures of the tool. The vertical movement of the press ram is redirected using wedges which distributes and redirects the force of the forging press in horizontal directions.

===Isothermal forging===
Isothermal forging is a process by which the materials and the die are heated to the same temperature (&quot;&quot; meaning &quot;equal&quot;). Adiabatic heating is used to assist in the deformation of the material, meaning the strain rates are highly controlled. This technique is commonly used for forging aluminium, which has a lower forging temperature than steels. Forging temperatures for aluminum are around , while steels and super alloys can be .

Benefits:
*Near net shapes which lead to lower machining requirements and therefore lower scrap rates
*Reproducibility of the part
*Due to the lower heat loss smaller machines can be used to make the forging

Disadvantages:
*Higher die material costs to handle temperatures and pressures
*Uniform heating systems are required
*Protective atmospheres or vacuum to reduce oxidation of the dies and material
*Low production rates

== Materials and applications ==

=== Forging of steel ===

Depending on the forming temperature steel forging can be divided into:

* Hot forging of steel
** Forging temperatures above the recrystallization temperature between 950–1250 °C
** Good formability
** Low forming forces
** Constant tensile strength of the workpieces
* Warm forging of steel
** Forging temperatures between 750–950 °C

For industrial processes steel alloys are primarily forged in hot condition. Brass, bronze, copper, precious metals and their alloys are manufactured by cold forging processes; each metal requires a different forging temperature.

=== Forging of aluminium ===

* Aluminium forging is performed at a temperature range between 350–550 °C
* Forging temperatures above 550 °C are too close to the solidus temperature of the alloys and lead in conjunction with varying effective strains to unfavorable workpiece surfaces and potentially to a partial melting as well as fold formation.
* Forging temperatures below 350 °C reduce formability by increasing the yield stress, which can lead to unfilled dies, cracking at the workpiece surface and increased die forces

Due to the narrow temperature range and high thermal conductivity, aluminium forging can only be realized in a particular process window. To provide good forming conditions a homogeneous temperature distribution in the entire workpiece is necessary. Therefore, the control of the tool temperature has a major influence to the process. For example, by optimizing the preform geometries the local effective strains can be influenced to reduce local overheating for a more homogeneous temperature distribution.

==== Application of aluminium forged parts ====

High-strength aluminium alloys have the tensile strength of medium strong steel alloys while providing significant weight advantages. Therefore, aluminium forged parts are mainly used in aerospace, automotive industry and many other fields of engineering especially in those fields, where highest safety standards against failure by abuse, by shock or vibratory stresses are needed. Such parts are for example pistons, chassis parts, steering components and brake parts. Commonly used alloys are AlSi1MgMn (EN AW-6082) and AlZnMgCu1,5 (EN AW-7075). About 80% of all aluminium forged parts are made of AlSi1MgMn. The high-strength alloy AlZnMgCu1,5 is mainly used for aerospace applications.

=== Forging of magnesium ===

* Magnesium forging occurs at a temperature range between 290–450 °C

Magnesium alloys are more difficult to forge due to their low plasticity, low sensitivity to strain rates and narrow forming temperature. Using semi-open die hot forging with a three-slide forging press (TSFP) has become a newly developed forging method for Mg-Al alloy AZ31, commonly used in forming aircraft brackets. This forging method has shown to improve tensile properties but lacks uniform grain size. Even though the application of magnesium alloys increases by 15–20% each year in the aerospace and automotive industry, forging magnesium alloys with specialized dies is expensive and an unfeasible method to produce parts for a mass market. Instead, most magnesium alloy parts for industry are produced by casting methods.

== Equipment ==
The most common type of forging equipment is the hammer and anvil. Principles behind the hammer and anvil are still used today in &quot;drop-hammer&quot; equipment. The principle behind the machine is simple: raise the hammer and drop it or propel it into the workpiece, which rests on the anvil. The main variations between drop-hammers are in the way the hammer is powered; the most common being air and steam hammers. Drop-hammers usually operate in a vertical position. The main reason for this is excess energy (energy that is not used to deform the workpiece) that is not released as heat or sound needs to be transmitted to the foundation. Moreover, a large machine base is needed to absorb the impacts.

To overcome some shortcomings of the drop-hammer, the &quot;counterblow machine&quot; or &quot;impactor&quot; is used. In a counterblow machine both the hammer and anvil move and the workpiece is held between them. Here excess energy becomes recoil. This allows the machine to work horizontally and have a smaller base. Other advantages include less noise, heat and vibration. It also produces a distinctly different flow pattern. Both of these machines can be used for open-die or closed-die forging.
===Forging presses===
A &quot;forging press&quot;, often just called a press, is used for press forging. There are two main types: mechanical and hydraulic presses. Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or toggles to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due to the nature of this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). Hydraulic presses, such as the four-die device, use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press are its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages include a slower, larger, and costlier machine to operate.

The roll forging, upsetting, and automatic hot forging processes all use specialized machinery.

<text>Heat treating (or heat treatment) is a group of industrial, thermal and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material. The most common application is metallurgical. Heat treatments are also used in the manufacture of many other materials, such as glass. Heat treatment involves the use of heating or chilling, normally to extreme temperatures, to achieve the desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. Heat treatment techniques include annealing, case hardening, precipitation strengthening, tempering, carburizing, normalizing and quenching. Although the term &quot;heat treatment&quot; applies only to processes where the heating and cooling are done for the specific purpose of altering properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during other manufacturing processes such as hot forming or welding.

==Physical processes==

Metallic materials consist of a microstructure of small crystals called &quot;grains&quot; or crystallites. The nature of the grains (i.e. grain size and composition) is one of the most effective factors that can determine the overall mechanical behavior of the metal. Heat treatment provides an efficient way to manipulate the properties of the metal by controlling the rate of diffusion and the rate of cooling within the microstructure. Heat treating is often used to alter the mechanical properties of a metallic alloy, manipulating properties such as the hardness, strength, toughness, ductility, and elasticity.

There are two mechanisms that may change an alloy&#x27;s properties during heat treatment: the formation of martensite causes the crystals to deform intrinsically, and the diffusion mechanism causes changes in the homogeneity of the alloy.

The crystal structure consists of atoms that are grouped in a very specific arrangement, called a lattice. In most elements, this order will rearrange itself, depending on conditions like temperature and pressure. This rearrangement called allotropy or polymorphism, may occur several times, at many different temperatures for a particular metal. In alloys, this rearrangement may cause an element that will not normally dissolve into the base metal to suddenly become soluble, while a reversal of the allotropy will make the elements either partially or completely insoluble.

When in the soluble state, the process of diffusion causes the atoms of the dissolved element to spread out, attempting to form a homogenous distribution within the crystals of the base metal. If the alloy is cooled to an insoluble state, the atoms of the dissolved constituents (solutes) may migrate out of the solution. This type of diffusion, called precipitation, leads to nucleation, where the migrating atoms group together at the grain-boundaries. This forms a microstructure generally consisting of two or more distinct phases. For instance, steel that has been heated above the austenizing temperature (red to orange-hot, or around to depending on carbon content), and then cooled slowly, forms a laminated structure composed of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite, becoming soft pearlite. After heating the steel to the austenite phase and then quenching it in water, the microstructure will be in the martensitic phase. This is due to the fact that the steel will change from the austenite phase to the martensite phase after quenching. Some pearlite or ferrite may be present if the quench did not rapidly cool off all the steel.

Unlike iron-based alloys, most heat-treatable alloys do not experience a ferrite transformation. In these alloys, the nucleation at the grain-boundaries often reinforces the structure of the crystal matrix. These metals harden by precipitation. Typically a slow process, depending on temperature, this is often referred to as &quot;age hardening&quot;.

Many metals and non-metals exhibit a martensite transformation when cooled quickly (with external media like oil, polymer, water, etc.). When a metal is cooled very quickly, the insoluble atoms may not be able to migrate out of the solution in time. This is called a &quot;diffusionless transformation.&quot; When the crystal matrix changes to its low-temperature arrangement, the atoms of the solute become trapped within the lattice. The trapped atoms prevent the crystal matrix from completely changing into its low-temperature allotrope, creating shearing stresses within the lattice. When some alloys are cooled quickly, such as steel, the martensite transformation hardens the metal, while in others, like aluminum, the alloy becomes softer.

==Effects of composition==
The specific composition of an alloy system will usually have a great effect on the results of heat treating. If the percentage of each constituent is just right, the alloy will form a single, continuous microstructure upon cooling. Such a mixture is said to be eutectoid. However, If the percentage of the solutes varies from the eutectoid mixture, two or more different microstructures will usually form simultaneously. A hypo eutectoid solution contains less of the solute than the eutectoid mix, while a hypereutectoid solution contains more.

===Eutectoid alloys===
A eutectoid (eutectic-like) alloy is similar in behavior to a eutectic alloy. A &quot;eutectic&quot; alloy is characterized by having a single melting point. This melting point is lower than that of any of the constituents, and no change in the mixture will lower the melting point any further. When a molten eutectic alloy is cooled, all of the constituents will crystallize into their respective phases at the same temperature.

A eutectoid alloy is similar, but the phase change occurs, not from a liquid, but from a solid solution. Upon cooling a eutectoid alloy from the solution temperature, the constituents will separate into different crystal phases, forming a single microstructure. A eutectoid steel, for example, contains 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling slowly, the solution of iron and carbon (a single phase called austenite) will separate into platelets of the phases ferrite and cementite. This forms a layered microstructure called pearlite.

Since pearlite is harder than iron, the degree of softness achievable is typically limited to that produced by the pearlite. Similarly, the hardenability is limited by the continuous martensitic microstructure formed when cooled very fast.

===Hypoeutectoid alloys===
A hypoeutectic alloy has two separate melting points. Both are above the eutectic melting point for the system but are below the melting points of any constituent forming the system. Between these two melting points, the alloy will exist as part solid and part liquid. The constituent with the higher melting point will solidify first. When completely solidified, a hypoeutectic alloy will often be in a solid solution.

Similarly, a hypoeutectoid alloy has two critical temperatures, called &quot;arrests&quot;. Between these two temperatures, the alloy will exist partly as the solution and partly as a separate crystallizing phase, called the &quot;pro eutectoid phase&quot;. These two temperatures are called the upper (A3) and lower (A1) transformation temperatures. As the solution cools from the upper transformation temperature toward an insoluble state, the excess base metal will often be forced to &quot;crystallize-out&quot;, becoming the pro eutectoid. This will occur until the remaining concentration of solutes reaches the eutectoid level, which will then crystallize as a separate microstructure.

For example, a hypoeutectoid steel contains less than 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling a hypoeutectoid steel from the austenite transformation temperature, small islands of proeutectoid-ferrite will form. These will continue to grow and the carbon will recede until the eutectoid concentration in the rest of the steel is reached. This eutectoid mixture will then crystallize as a microstructure of pearlite. Since ferrite is softer than pearlite, the two microstructures combine to increase the ductility of the alloy. Consequently, the hardenability of the alloy is lowered.

===Hypereutectoid alloys===

A hypereutectic alloy also has different melting points. However, between these points, it is the constituent with the higher melting point that will be solid. Similarly, a hypereutectoid alloy has two critical temperatures. When cooling a hypereutectoid alloy from the upper transformation temperature, it will usually be the excess solutes that crystallize-out first, forming the pro-eutectoid. This continues until the concentration in the remaining alloy becomes eutectoid, which then crystallizes into a separate microstructure.

A hypereutectoid steel contains more than 0.77% carbon. When slowly cooling hypereutectoid steel, the cementite will begin to crystallize first. When the remaining steel becomes eutectoid in composition, it will crystallize into pearlite. Since cementite is much harder than pearlite, the alloy has greater hardenability at a cost in ductility.

==Effects of time and temperature==
Proper heat treating requires precise control over temperature, time held at a certain temperature and cooling rate.
With the exception of stress-relieving, tempering, and aging, most heat treatments begin by heating an alloy beyond a certain transformation, or arrest (A), temperature. This temperature is referred to as an &quot;arrest&quot; because at the A temperature the metal experiences a period of hysteresis. At this point, all of the heat energy is used to cause the crystal change, so the temperature stops rising for a short time (arrests) and then continues climbing once the change is complete. Therefore, the alloy must be heated above the critical temperature for a transformation to occur. The alloy will usually be held at this temperature long enough for the heat to completely penetrate the alloy, thereby bringing it into a complete solid solution. Iron, for example, has four critical-temperatures, depending on carbon content. Pure iron in its alpha (room temperature) state changes to nonmagnetic gamma-iron at its A2 temperature, and weldable delta-iron at its A4 temperature. However, as carbon is added, becoming steel, the A2 temperature splits into the A3 temperature, also called the austenizing temperature (all phases become austenite, a solution of gamma iron and carbon) and its A1 temperature (austenite changes into pearlite upon cooling). Between these upper and lower temperatures the pro eutectoid phase forms upon cooling.

Because a smaller grain size usually enhances mechanical properties, such as toughness, shear strength and tensile strength, these metals are often heated to a temperature that is just above the upper critical temperature, in order to prevent the grains of solution from growing too large. For instance, when steel is heated above the upper critical-temperature, small grains of austenite form. These grow larger as the temperature is increased. When cooled very quickly, during a martensite transformation, the austenite grain-size directly affects the martensitic grain-size. Larger grains have large grain-boundaries, which serve as weak spots in the structure. The grain size is usually controlled to reduce the probability of breakage.

The diffusion transformation is very time-dependent. Cooling a metal will usually suppress the precipitation to a much lower temperature. Austenite, for example, usually only exists above the upper critical temperature. However, if the austenite is cooled quickly enough, the transformation may be suppressed for hundreds of degrees below the lower critical temperature. Such austenite is highly unstable and, if given enough time, will precipitate into various microstructures of ferrite and cementite. The cooling rate can be used to control the rate of grain growth or can even be used to produce partially martensitic microstructures. However, the martensite transformation is time-independent. If the alloy is cooled to the martensite transformation (Ms) temperature before other microstructures can fully form, the transformation will usually occur at just under the speed of sound.

When austenite is cooled but kept above the martensite start temperature Ms so that a martensite transformation does not occur, the austenite grain size will have an effect on the rate of nucleation, but it is generally temperature and the rate of cooling that controls the grain size and microstructure. When austenite is cooled extremely slowly, it will form large ferrite crystals filled with spherical inclusions of cementite. This microstructure is referred to as &quot;sphereoidite&quot;. If cooled a little faster, then coarse pearlite will form. Even faster, and fine pearlite will form. If cooled even faster, bainite will form, with more complete bainite transformation occurring depending on the time held above martensite start Ms. Similarly, these microstructures will also form, if cooled to a specific temperature and then held there for a certain time.

Most non-ferrous alloys are also heated in order to form a solution. Most often, these are then cooled very quickly to produce a martensite transformation, putting the solution into a supersaturated state. The alloy, being in a much softer state, may then be cold worked. This causes work hardening that increases the strength and hardness of the alloy. Moreover, the defects caused by plastic deformation tend to speed up precipitation, increasing the hardness beyond what is normal for the alloy. Even if not cold worked, the solutes in these alloys will usually precipitate, although the process may take much longer. Sometimes these metals are then heated to a temperature that is below the lower critical (A1) temperature, preventing recrystallization, in order to speed-up the precipitation.

==Types of heat treatment==
Complex heat treating schedules, or &quot;cycles&quot;, are often devised by metallurgists to optimize an alloy&#x27;s mechanical properties. In the aerospace industry, a superalloy may undergo five or more different heat treating operations to develop the desired properties. This can lead to quality problems depending on the accuracy of the furnace&#x27;s temperature controls and timer. These operations can usually be divided into several basic techniques.

===Annealing===

Annealing consists of heating a metal to a specific temperature and then cooling at a rate that will produce a refined microstructure, either fully or partially separating the constituents. The rate of cooling is generally slow. Annealing is most often used to soften a metal for cold working, to improve machinability, or to enhance properties like electrical conductivity.

In ferrous alloys, annealing is usually accomplished by heating the metal beyond the upper critical temperature and then cooling very slowly, resulting in the formation of pearlite. In both pure metals and many alloys that cannot be heat treated, annealing is used to remove the hardness caused by cold working. The metal is heated to a temperature where recrystallization can occur, thereby repairing the defects caused by plastic deformation. In these metals, the rate of cooling will usually have little effect. Most non-ferrous alloys that are heat-treatable are also annealed to relieve the hardness of cold working. These may be slowly cooled to allow full precipitation of the constituents and produce a refined microstructure.

Ferrous alloys are usually either &quot;full annealed&quot; or &quot;process annealed&quot;. Full annealing requires very slow cooling rates, in order to form coarse pearlite. In process annealing, the cooling rate may be faster; up to, and including normalizing. The main goal of process annealing is to produce a uniform microstructure. Non-ferrous alloys are often subjected to a variety of annealing techniques, including &quot;recrystallization annealing&quot;, &quot;partial annealing&quot;, &quot;full annealing&quot;, and &quot;final annealing&quot;. Not all annealing techniques involve recrystallization, such as stress relieving.

===Normalizing===
Normalizing is a technique used to provide uniformity in grain size and composition (equiaxed crystals) throughout an alloy. The term is often used for ferrous alloys that have been austenitized and then cooled in the open air. Normalizing not only produces pearlite but also martensite and sometimes bainite, which gives harder and stronger steel but with less ductility for the same composition than full annealing.

In the normalizing process the steel is heated to about 40 degrees Celsius above its upper critical temperature limit, held at this temperature for some time, and then cooled in air.

===Stress relieving===
Stress-relieving is a technique to remove or reduce the internal stresses created in metal. These stresses may be caused in a number of ways, ranging from cold working to non-uniform cooling. Stress-relieving is usually accomplished by heating a metal below the lower critical temperature and then cooling uniformly. Stress relieving is commonly used on items like air tanks, boilers and other pressure vessels, to remove a portion of the stresses created during the welding process.

===Aging===

Some metals are classified as &quot;precipitation hardening metals&quot;. When a precipitation hardening alloy is quenched, its alloying elements will be trapped in solution, resulting in a soft metal. Aging a &quot;solutionized&quot; metal will allow the alloying elements to diffuse through the microstructure and form intermetallic particles. These intermetallic particles will nucleate and fall out of the solution and act as a reinforcing phase, thereby increasing the strength of the alloy. Alloys may age &quot; naturally&quot; meaning that the precipitates form at room temperature, or they may age &quot;artificially&quot; when precipitates only form at elevated temperatures. In some applications, naturally aging alloys may be stored in a freezer to prevent hardening until after further operations - assembly of rivets, for example, maybe easier with a softer part.

Examples of precipitation hardening alloys include 2000 series, 6000 series, and 7000 series aluminium alloy, as well as some superalloys and some stainless steels. Steels that harden by aging are typically referred to as maraging steels, from a combination of the term &quot;martensite aging&quot;.

===Quenching===

Quenching is a process of cooling a metal at a rapid rate. This is most often done to produce a martensite transformation. In ferrous alloys, this will often produce a harder metal, while non-ferrous alloys will usually become softer than normal.

To harden by quenching, a metal (usually steel or cast iron) must be heated above the upper critical temperature (Steel: above 815~900 degrees Celsius) and then quickly cooled. Depending on the alloy and other considerations (such as concern for maximum hardness vs. cracking and distortion), cooling may be done with forced air or other gases, (such as nitrogen). Liquids may be used, due to their better thermal conductivity, such as oil, water, a polymer dissolved in water, or a brine. Upon being rapidly cooled, a portion of austenite (dependent on alloy composition) will transform to martensite, a hard, brittle crystalline structure. The quenched hardness of a metal depends on its chemical composition and quenching method. Cooling speeds, from fastest to slowest, go from brine, polymer (i.e. mixtures of water + glycol polymers), freshwater, oil, and forced air. However, quenching certain steel too fast can result in cracking, which is why high-tensile steels such as AISI 4140 should be quenched in oil, tool steels such as ISO 1.2767 or H13 hot work tool steel should be quenched in forced air, and low alloy or medium-tensile steels such as XK1320 or AISI 1040 should be quenched in brine.

Some Beta titanium based alloys have also shown similar trends of increased strength through rapid cooling. However, most non-ferrous metals, like alloys of copper, aluminum, or nickel, and some high alloy steels such as austenitic stainless steel (304, 316), produce an opposite effect when these are quenched: they soften. Austenitic stainless steels must be quenched to become fully corrosion resistant, as they work-harden significantly.

===Tempering===

Untempered martensitic steel, while very hard, is too brittle to be useful for most applications. A method for alleviating this problem is called tempering. Most applications require that quenched parts be tempered. Tempering consists of heating steel below the lower critical temperature, (often from 400˚F to 1105˚F or 205˚C to 595˚C, depending on the desired results), to impart some toughness. Higher tempering temperatures (maybe up to 1,300˚F or 700˚C, depending on the alloy and application) are sometimes used to impart further ductility, although some yield strength is lost.

Tempering may also be performed on normalized steels. Other methods of tempering consist of quenching to a specific temperature, which is above the martensite start temperature, and then holding it there until pure bainite can form or internal stresses can be relieved. These include austempering and martempering.

====Tempering colors====

Steel that has been freshly ground or polished will form oxide layers when heated. At a very specific temperature, the iron oxide will form a layer with a very specific thickness, causing thin-film interference. This causes colors to appear on the surface of the steel. As the temperature is increased, the iron oxide layer grows in thickness, changing the color. These colors, called tempering colors, have been used for centuries to gauge the temperature of the metal.

* 350˚F (176˚C), light yellowish
* 400˚F (204˚C), light-straw
* 440˚F (226˚C), dark-straw
* 500˚F (260˚C), brown
* 540˚F (282˚C), purple
* 590˚F (310˚C), deep blue
* 640˚F (337˚C), light blue

The tempering colors can be used to judge the final properties of the tempered steel. Very hard tools are often tempered in the light to the dark straw range, whereas springs are often tempered to the blue. However, the final hardness of the tempered steel will vary, depending on the composition of the steel. Higher-carbon tool steel will remain much harder after tempering than spring steel (of slightly less carbon) when tempered at the same temperature. The oxide film will also increase in thickness over time. Therefore, steel that has been held at 400˚F for a very long time may turn brown or purple, even though the temperature never exceeded that needed to produce a light straw color. Other factors affecting the final outcome are oil films on the surface and the type of heat source used.

===Selective heat treating===

Many heat treating methods have been developed to alter the properties of only a portion of an object. These tend to consist of either cooling different areas of an alloy at different rates, by quickly heating in a localized area and then quenching, by thermochemical diffusion, or by tempering different areas of an object at different temperatures, such as in differential tempering. 

====Differential hardening====

Some techniques allow different areas of a single object to receive different heat treatments. This is called differential hardening. It is common in high quality knives and swords. The Chinese jian is one of the earliest known examples of this, and the Japanese katana may be the most widely known. The Nepalese Khukuri is another example. This technique uses an insulating layer, like layers of clay, to cover the areas that are to remain soft. The areas to be hardened are left exposed, allowing only certain parts of the steel to fully harden when quenched. 

====Flame hardening====

Flame hardening is used to harden only a portion of the metal. Unlike differential hardening, where the entire piece is heated and then cooled at different rates, in flame hardening, only a portion of the metal is heated before quenching. This is usually easier than differential hardening, but often produces an extremely brittle zone between the heated metal and the unheated metal, as cooling at the edge of this heat-affected zone is extremely rapid. 

====Induction hardening====

Induction hardening is a surface hardening technique in which the surface of the metal is heated very quickly, using a no-contact method of induction heating. The alloy is then quenched, producing a martensite transformation at the surface while leaving the underlying metal unchanged. This creates a very hard, wear-resistant surface while maintaining the proper toughness in the majority of the object. Crankshaft journals are a good example of an induction hardened surface.

====Case hardening====

Case hardening is a thermochemical diffusion process in which an alloying element, most commonly carbon or nitrogen, diffuses into the surface of a monolithic metal. The resulting interstitial solid solution is harder than the base material, which improves wear resistance without sacrificing toughness.

Laser surface engineering is a surface treatment with high versatility, selectivity and novel properties. Since the cooling rate is very high in laser treatment, metastable even metallic glass can be obtained by this method.

===Cold and cryogenic treating===

Although quenching steel causes the austenite to transform into martensite, all of the austenite usually does not transform. Some austenite crystals will remain unchanged even after quenching below the martensite finish (Mf) temperature. Further transformation of the austenite into martensite can be induced by slowly cooling the metal to extremely low temperatures. Cold treating generally consists of cooling the steel to around -115˚F (-81˚C), but does not eliminate all of the austenite. Cryogenic treating usually consists of cooling to much lower temperatures, often in the range of -315˚F (-192˚C), to transform most of the austenite into martensite.

Cold and cryogenic treatments are typically done immediately after quenching, before any tempering, and will increase the hardness, wear resistance, and reduce the internal stresses in the metal but, because it is really an extension of the quenching process, it may increase the chances of cracking during the procedure. The process is often used for tools, bearings, or other items that require good wear resistance. However, it is usually only effective in high-carbon or high-alloy steels in which more than 10% austenite is retained after quenching.

===Decarburization===
The heating of steel is sometimes used as a method to alter the carbon content. When steel is heated in an oxidizing environment, the oxygen combines with the iron to form an iron-oxide layer, which protects the steel from decarburization. When the steel turns to austenite, however, the oxygen combines with iron to form a slag, which provides no protection from decarburization. The formation of slag and scale actually increases decarburization, because the iron oxide keeps oxygen in contact with the decarburization zone even after the steel is moved into an oxygen-free environment, such as the coals of a forge. Thus, the carbon atoms begin combining with the surrounding scale and slag to form both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which is released into the air.

Steel contains a relatively small percentage of carbon, which can migrate freely within the gamma iron. When austenitized steel is exposed to air for long periods of time, the carbon content in the steel can be lowered. This is the opposite from what happens when steel is heated in a reducing environment, in which carbon slowly diffuses further into the metal. In an oxidizing environment, the carbon can readily diffuse outwardly, so austenitized steel is very susceptible to decarburization. This is often used for cast steel, where a high carbon-content is needed for casting, but a lower carbon-content is desired in the finished product. It is often used on cast-irons to produce malleable cast iron, in a process called &quot;white tempering&quot;. This tendency to decarburize is often a problem in other operations, such as blacksmithing, where it becomes more desirable to austenize the steel for the shortest amount of time possible to prevent too much decarburization.

==Specification of heat treatment==
Usually the end condition is specified instead of the process used in heat treatment.

===Case hardening===
Case hardening is specified by &quot;hardness&quot; and &quot;case depth&quot;. The case depth can be specified in two ways: total case depth or effective case depth. The total case depth is the true depth of the case. For most alloys, the effective case depth is the depth of the case that has a hardness equivalent of HRC50; however, some alloys specify a different hardness (40-60 HRC) at effective case depth; this is checked on a Tukon microhardness tester. This value can be roughly approximated as 65% of the total case depth; however, the chemical composition and hardenability can affect this approximation. If neither type of case depth is specified the total case depth is assumed.

For case hardened parts the specification should have a tolerance of at least ±. If the part is to be ground after heat treatment, the case depth is assumed to be after grinding.

The Rockwell hardness scale used for the specification depends on the depth of the total case depth, as shown in the table below. Usually, hardness is measured on the Rockwell &quot;C&quot; scale, but the load used on the scale will penetrate through the case if the case is less than . Using Rockwell &quot;C&quot; for a thinner case will result in a false reading.

For cases that are less than thick a Rockwell scale cannot reliably be used, so &quot;&quot; is specified instead. File hard is approximately equivalent to 58 HRC.

When specifying the hardness either a range should be given or the minimum hardness specified. If a range is specified at least 5 points should be given.

===Through hardening===
Only hardness is listed for through hardening. It is usually in the form of HRC with at least a five-point range.

===Annealing===
The hardness for an annealing process is usually listed on the HRB scale as a maximum value. It is a process to refine grain size, improve strength, remove residual stress, and affect the electromagnetic properties...

== Types of furnaces ==
Furnaces used for heat treatment can be split into two broad categories: batch furnaces and continuous furnaces. Batch furnaces are usually manually loaded and unloaded, whereas continuous furnaces have an automatic conveying system to provide a constant load into the furnace chamber.

=== Batch furnaces ===
Batch systems usually consist of an insulated chamber with a steel shell, a heating system, and an access door to the chamber.

=== Box-type furnace ===
Many basic box-type furnaces have been upgraded to a semi-continuous batch furnace with the addition of integrated quench tanks and slow-cool chambers. These upgraded furnaces are a very commonly used piece of equipment for heat-treating.

=== Car-type furnace ===
Also known as a &quot; bogie hearth&quot;, the car furnace is an extremely large batch furnace. The floor is constructed as an insulated movable car that is moved in and out of the furnace for loading and unloading. The car is usually sealed using sand seals or solid seals when in position. Due to the difficulty in getting a sufficient seal, car furnaces are usually used for non-atmosphere processes. 

=== Elevator-type furnace ===
Similar in type to the car furnace, except that the car and hearth are rolled into position beneath the furnace and raised by means of a motor-driven mechanism, elevator furnaces can handle large heavy loads and often eliminate the need for any external cranes and transfer mechanisms.

=== Bell-type furnace ===
Bell furnaces have removable covers called &quot;bells&quot;, which are lowered over the load and hearth by crane. An inner bell is placed over the hearth and sealed to supply a protective atmosphere. An outer bell is lowered to provide the heat supply.

=== Pit furnaces ===
Furnaces that are constructed in a pit and extend to floor level or slightly above are called pit furnaces. Workpieces can be suspended from fixtures, held in baskets, or placed on bases in the furnace. Pit furnaces are suited to heating long tubes, shafts, and rods by holding them in a vertical position. This manner of loading provides minimal distortion.

=== Salt bath furnaces ===
Salt baths are used in a wide variety of heat treatment processes including neutral hardening, liquid carburising, liquid nitriding, austempering, martempering and tempering.

Parts are loaded into a pot of molten salt where they are heated by conduction, giving a very readily available source of heat. The core temperature of a part rises in temperature at approximately the same rate as its surface in a salt bath.

Salt baths utilize a variety of salts for heat treatment, with cyanide salts being the most extensively used. Concerns about associated occupation health and safety, and expensive waste management and disposal due to their environmental effects have made the use of salt baths less attractive in recent years. Consequently, many salt baths are being replaced by more environmentally friendly fluidized bed furnaces.

=== Fluidised bed furnaces ===
A fluidised bed consists of a cylindrical retort made from high-temperature alloy, filled with sand-like aluminum oxide particulate. Gas (air or nitrogen) is bubbled through the oxide and the sand moves in such a way that it exhibits fluid-like behavior, hence the term &quot;fluidized&quot;. The solid-solid contact of the oxide gives very high thermal conductivity and excellent temperature uniformity throughout the furnace, comparable to those seen in a salt bath.

<text>Swords ( or ) in County Dublin, the county town of the local government area of Fingal, is a large suburban town on the east coast of Ireland, situated ten kilometres north of Dublin city centre. It is the eighth largest urban area in Ireland, with a population of 40,776 as of the 2022 census. The town was reputedly founded . Located on the Ward River, Swords features Swords Castle, a restored medieval castle, a holy well from which it takes its name, a round tower and a Norman tower. Facilities in the area include the Pavilions shopping centre, one of the largest in the Dublin region, a range of civic offices, some light industries, the main storage facility and archive of the National Museum of Ireland and several parks. Dublin Airport is located nearby.

The name &quot;Swords&quot; gives its name to a townland of Swords Demesne, a civil parish, and a local electoral area.

== History ==
===Origins and etymology===
The town&#x27;s origins date back to 560 AD when it was reputedly founded by Saint Colmcille (521–567). Legend has it that the saint blessed a local well, giving the settlement its name, &quot;Sord&quot;, meaning &quot;clear&quot; or &quot;pure&quot;. However, &quot;An Sord&quot; also means &quot;the water source&quot; and could indicate a large communal drinking well that existed in antiquity. St. Colmcille&#x27;s Well is located on Well Road off Main Street. &quot;Sord&quot; may also refer to a &quot;&quot;, an &quot;expanse of grass&quot;. The most common landscape indicators of early Christian settlement are the ecclesiastical enclosures, and in the case of Swords, the street pattern has been influenced by the circular alignment of the settlement.

===Development===
The medieval town developed in a linear pattern along Main Street, in a roughly north–south direction. The round tower, 26m in height, is also an indicator of early Christian settlement. The Irish high king Brian Boru is said to have had his Requiem Mass offered at the church on Spittal Hill after he was killed at the Battle of Clontarf; this was of course before the hospital and even the Church of Ireland when there would have been a small chapel there along with the round tower.

In medieval times, the manor of Swords was English Crown property, and by tradition was granted to each Archbishop of Dublin for his lifetime.

The parliamentary borough of Swords elected two MPs to the Irish House of Commons. It was disenfranchised in 1801 by the Acts of Union 1800.

At the northern end of the street stands Swords Castle, 200m northeast of the ecclesiastical site, which was built in the early 13th century. A short distance north of the castle is the elevation known as Spittal Hill, where a hospital once stood.

In 1994, Swords became the county town of the new county of Fingal after the abolition of County Dublin as an administrative county. In 2001, upon the completion of the County Hall, senior executive offices moved there from Parnell Square in Dublin city centre.

In June 2006, the RNLI Ireland officially opened a new all-Ireland headquarters at Airside Business Park, within greater Swords. The National Museum of Ireland operates its Collections Resource Centre (CRC) at a former Motorola factory site on the northern edge of the town. The size of two football fields, the CRC includes storage, archive, library and research facilities serving all branches of the museum.

===Strategic vision===
Fingal County Council&#x27;s &quot;Strategic Vision&quot; for Swords declared an aim of forming a sustainable &quot;new city&quot;; the council has referred to Swords as an &quot;emerging city&quot; and has projected that the population of Swords would rise towards 100,000 by the year 2035. As of 2023, the town is the eighth-largest urban area in the country.

The &quot;Swords Cultural Quarter Masterplan&quot; by the county council proposed to redevelop the area surrounding the castle into the &quot;Swords Cultural Quarter&quot;, and to build a new Cultural Centre within this area. Work on the Cultural Centre began in April 2023, with a view to begin building mid-2024. During the enabling works of the project, two medieval wells were discovered under the existing car park. The wells were removed by archaeologists and preserved for potential display at a later date. The Cultural Centre is proposed to include a new library, art gallery, theatre and café. If implemented as planned, the masterplan would also change the layout of the roads surrounding the castle.

===Quality of life===

In 2012, Swords was named the third-best town in Ireland to live in. The survey conducted by Retail Excellence Ireland took into account safety, retail, dining, entertainment, events, car parking and the overall attractiveness of the town. Swords has seen steady regeneration of shop fronts, public buildings, and footpaths and the restoration of Swords Castle since the mid-1990s. Households in Swords have the seventh-highest median incomes in the state, among distinct towns (a comparison excluding most other suburbs of the city).

A 2011 Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL) survey declared Swords to be the second cleanest town in Ireland. This came just eight years after an IBAL survey had scored the town as the worst &quot;litter blackspot&quot; in the country. In the 2019 survey, An Taisce, who carry out the surveys on behalf of IBAL, stated: &quot;A stellar showing for this large urban area. Swords is a model for others to follow.&quot;

== Geography ==

=== Landscape ===

Swords is situated roughly in the centre of the modern county of Fingal and the ancient barony of Nethercross. The Ward River, coming from County Meath, runs west to east to near the centre of the town, and then turns to run north, before flowing into the Broad Meadow Water or Broadmeadow River to the east of the town, across the former northern road. A small stream joins the Ward near the town centre and the holy well. The Broadmeadow, also flowing from Meath, borders the north of the town. It runs from Dunshaughlin in the west and across the north of Swords, before receiving the Ward and flowing into the wide Broadmeadow Estuary, then into the Irish Sea past Malahide. The estuary is crossed by a railway embankment and bridge from Malahide. Swords is surrounded by a protected green belt. Dublin Airport has prevented the town from expanding further south and the large Broadmeadow Estuary and Malahide beyond limit expansion further east. To the north and west of Swords, there is sparsely-populated, relatively flat, farmland.

=== Townlands and baronies ===
The civil parish of Swords mainly lies in the ancient barony of Nethercross. Swords Demesne is the name of the townland in the heart of the urban town of Swords. It is one of 58 such geographic units in the civil parish. However, a single parcel of land, 5 acres in extent, is situated in the barony of Coolock as an exclave of the civil parish proper.

There are 10 townlands in the electoral division of Swords, which is not coterminous with the civil parish.

=== Urban layout ===
The main retail area is located in the centre of the town and includes the town&#x27;s wide, tree-lined Main Street, and the Pavilions and Swords Central combined shopping centres. There are also two smaller retail developments, Swords Plaza and Swords Town Mall. Most civic facilities are also in this central area, with some subsidiary shopping and civic centres in surrounding housing areas.

The west of the urban area is mainly residential, with the neighbourhoods of Applewood, Rathbeale and Brackenstown to the north of the Ward River and Knocksedan, River Valley, Rathingle, Highfields, and Boroimhe to the south side of the river.

The main business and industrial areas are located to the east of the town centre, along the R132 dual carriageway. These include Balheary Industrial Park, Swords Business Campus, Swords Business Park, and the Airside campus (Business Park, Retail Park and Motor Park). These campuses separate the town centre from the residential neighbourhoods further east — Seatown, Lissenhall, Holywell and Drynam (or Drinan) — for which reason the Central Statistics Office treats the latter areas as forming a separate census town, which since 1991 it has dubbed &quot;Kinsealy–Drinan&quot; and had a population of 7,526 at the 2022 census. The development plan for Fingal County Council treats Kinsealy–Drinan as part of Swords.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Swords is, like the rest of Ireland, classified as a maritime temperate climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system. It is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. The hottest months of the year are June, July and August with temperatures of around 17 – 20 degrees. Swords gets rainfall all year round and the wettest months are October to January.


=== Demographics ===
Swords has developed into the eighth largest urban area in Ireland, with a population of 40,776 at the 2022 census. The town&#x27;s period of rapid population growth began in the 1970s with the construction of the extensive Rivervalley Estate, then Ireland&#x27;s largest private housing development, ahead of the Kilnamanagh Estate in Tallaght North. It continued during the 1990s and 2000s, with many new residents moving to the area due to its proximity to work at Dublin Airport and various industrial estates / business parks.

Fingal County Council has referred to Swords as an &quot;Emerging City&quot;, and has suggested that the overall area&#x27;s population may reach 100,000 by 2035.

== Transport ==
=== Roads ===

Swords has good road links due to its proximity to Dublin city, which is the main focus of the Irish road network. The M1 Dublin–Belfast motorway passes along the eastern edge of the town and is the main route to/from Dublin City, Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry and Belfast. The M50 Dublin semi-orbital motorway passes to the south of the town and provides connections with all of the other main roads out of Dublin (N2, N3, N4, N7, N81 and M11). The R132 dual-carriageway bypasses the centre of Swords, and runs south to Dublin Airport and north to Balbriggan.

== Features and historical attractions ==
Some historical attractions are listed below. Many of these are promoted by Swords Historical Society.
=== Swords Castle ===

Swords Castle was built as the manorial residence of the 1st Archbishop of Dublin, John Comyn, around 1200 or a little later in Swords, just north of Dublin. It was never strong in the military sense, but covers a large pentagonal walled area of nearly with a tower on the north and a gateway complex on the south. The adjoining chapel, built in the late thirteenth century, was probably used as the Archbishop&#x27;s private oratory.

Other buildings, recorded in an inquisition in 1326, have now vanished, including the great hall on the east side of the enclosure. The Archbishop abandoned Swords once a new palace was built at Tallaght in 1324. The stepped battlements suggest some form of occupancy during the fifteenth century, but by 1583, when briefly occupied by Dutch Protestants, it was described as &quot;the quite spoiled old castle&quot;. It was used as a garden in the nineteenth century and sold after the Church of Ireland was disestablished.

Swords Castle has undergone restoration and is open as a tourist attraction. The castle was used as a film location for the production of TV series &quot;The Tudors&quot; in the spring of 2010.

<text>A tassel is a finishing feature in fabric and clothing decoration. It is a universal ornament that is seen in varying versions in many cultures around the globe.

==History and use==
In the Hebrew Bible, the Lord spoke to Moses instructing him to tell the Israelites to make tassels (Hebrew tzitzit) on the corners of their garments, to help them to remember all the commandments of the Lord and to keep them (Numbers 15:37-40), and as a sign of holiness. The religious Hebrew tassel, however, bears little resemblance to the decorative one which appeared and eventually became popular in Europe, especially France and Spain.

In the West, tassels were originally a series of windings of thread or string around a suspending string until the desired curvature was attained. Later, turned wooden moulds, which were either covered in simple wrappings or much more elaborate coverings called &quot;satinings&quot;, were used. This involved an intricate binding of bands of filament silk vertically around the mould by means of an internal &quot;lacing&quot; in the bore of the mould. During the Middle Ages tassels were widely used in Spain as ornamentation for horses, called &quot;borla&quot; from the Latin term &quot;burrula&quot; which means &quot;wool of little value&quot;.

These constructions were varied and augmented with extensive ornamentations that were each assigned an idiosyncratic term by their French creators. In sixteenth-century France these individuals were called &quot;passementiers&quot;, and an apprenticeship of seven years was required to become a master in one of the subdivisions of the guild. The French widely exported their very artistic work, and at such low prices that no other European nation developed a mature &quot;trimmings&quot; industry. Many of the &quot;passementiers&quot;, however, were among the Protestant Huguenots who fled France in the 1600s to escape persecution, taking their tools and skills with them. Tassels and their associated forms changed style throughout the years, from the small and casual of Renaissance designs (see example), through the medium
sizes and more staid designs of the Empire period to the Victorian Era with the largest and most elaborate decorative flourishes. Some of these designs are returning today from the European and American artisans, who may charge a thousand dollars for a single hand-made tassel. The majority of the world&#x27;s tassel production, however, takes place in China which mass-produces and exports them globally.

Tassels (also called &quot;tufts&quot;) were traditionally worn by Oxford and Cambridge University undergraduates on their caps, those wearing gold tassels were those who had paid for the status of gentleman-commoner, thus receiving increased social prestige and more luxurious accommodation than ordinary commoners who wore plain black tassels on their caps. Today, only the Chancellor of Oxford wears a gold tassel.

In the Middle East, tassels were worn as talismans, especially on headwear. In Egypt, Mesopotamia, and throughout the Arab world tassels were worn by children on hoods or caps to protect them from malevolent spirits and ward off demons.

===Ceremonial wear===
In the U.S., tassels, or liripipes, are also found on mortarboards during university graduation ceremonies and possibly upon the shoes of the graduates at the ceremony. Near the conclusion of the graduation ceremony, the tassel that hangs from the graduate&#x27;s mortarboard is moved from the right to the left. Typically, the entire graduating class does this in unison.

==Structure==
A basic key tassel is made by binding or otherwise gathering threads from cord and creating a knot. Tassels are normally decorative elements, and as such one often finds them attached along the bottom hem of garments and curtains. The first Guild of Passementiers was created in France in the 1600s. The tassel was its primary expression, but it also included fringes, ornamental cords, galloons, pompons, rosettes, and gimps. Tassels, pompons and rosettes are &quot;point&quot; ornaments; the others are &quot;linear&quot; ornaments.

<text>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is an independent agency of the United States government whose principal mission is the enforcement of civil (non-criminal) antitrust law and the promotion of consumer protection. The FTC shares jurisdiction over federal civil antitrust law enforcement with the Department of Justice Antitrust Division. The agency is headquartered in the Federal Trade Commission Building in Washington, DC.

The FTC was established in 1914 by the Federal Trade Commission Act, which was passed in response to the 19th-century monopolistic trust crisis. Since its inception, the FTC has enforced the provisions of the Clayton Act, a key U.S. antitrust statute, as well as the provisions of the FTC Act, et seq. Over time, the FTC has been delegated with the enforcement of additional business regulation statutes and has promulgated a number of regulations (codified in Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations). The broad statutory authority granted to the FTC provides it with more surveillance and monitoring abilities than it actually uses.

The FTC is composed of five commissioners who are nominated by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. Commissioners serve seven-year terms, and no more than three FTC members can be from the same party. One member of the body serves as FTC Chair at the President&#x27;s pleasure, with Commissioner Andrew N. Ferguson having served as chair since January 2025.

==History==

=== Early history ===
In the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark decision in &quot;Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States&quot; in 1911, the first version of a bill to establish a commission to regulate interstate trade was introduced on January 25, 1912, by Oklahoma congressman Dick Thompson Morgan. He would make the first speech on the House floor advocating its creation on February 21, 1912.

Though the initial bill did not pass, the questions of trusts and antitrust dominated the 1912 election. Most political party platforms in 1912 endorsed the establishment of a federal trade commission with its regulatory powers placed in the hands of an administrative board, as an alternative to functions previously and necessarily exercised so slowly through the courts.

With the 1912 presidential election decided in favor of the Democrats and Woodrow Wilson, Morgan reintroduced a slightly amended version of his bill during the April 1913 special session. The national debate culminated in Wilson&#x27;s signing of the FTC Act on September 26, 1914, with additional tightening of regulations in the Clayton Antitrust Act three weeks later.

The new FTC would absorb the staff and duties of Bureau of Corporations, previously established under the Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903. The FTC could additionally challenge &quot;unfair methods of competition&quot; and enforce the Clayton Act&#x27;s more specific prohibitions against certain price discrimination, vertical arrangements, interlocking directorates, and stock acquisitions.

=== Recent history ===
In 1984, the FTC began to regulate the funeral home industry in order to protect consumers from deceptive practices. The FTC Funeral Rule requires funeral homes to provide all customers (and potential customers) with a General Price List (GPL), specifically outlining goods and services in the funeral industry, as defined by the FTC, and a listing of their prices. By law, the GPL must be presented on request to all individuals, and no one is to be denied a written, retainable copy of the GPL. In 1996, the FTC instituted the Funeral Rule Offenders Program (FROP), under which &quot;funeral homes make a voluntary payment to the U.S. Treasury or appropriate state fund for an amount less than what would likely be sought if the Commission authorized filing a lawsuit for civil penalties. In addition, the funeral homes participate in the NFDA compliance program, which includes a review of the price lists, on-site training of the staff, and follow-up testing and certification on compliance with the Funeral Rule.&quot;

In the mid-1990s, the FTC launched the fraud sweeps concept where the agency and its federal, state, and local partners filed simultaneous legal actions against multiple telemarketing fraud targets. The first sweeps operation was &quot;Project Telesweep&quot; in July 1995 which cracked down on 100 business opportunity scams.

In the 2021 United States Supreme Court case, &quot;AMG Capital Management, LLC v. FTC&quot;, the Court found unanimously that the FTC did not have power under of the FTC Act, amended in 1973, to seek equitable relief in courts; it had the power to seek only injunctive relief.

In 2023, Project 2025 suggested that an administration could abolish the FTC.

== Notable work since 2001 ==
=== Bush administration ===
==== Gateway Learning case ====

In the 2004 case &quot;In re Gateway Learning Corp.&quot;, the FTC alleged that Gateway committed unfair and deceptive trade practices by making retroactive changes to its privacy policy without informing customers and by violating its own privacy policy by selling customer information when it had said it would not. Gateway settled the complaint by entering into a consent decree with the FTC that required it to surrender some profits and placed restrictions upon Gateway for the following 20 years.
=== Obama administration ===
During the Obama Administration, Jon Leibowitz served as the Chair. 

==== Sears Holdings case ====

In the 2009 case &quot;In the Matter of Sears Holdings Management Corp.&quot;, the FTC alleged that a research software program provided by Sears was deceptive because it collected information about nearly all online behavior, a fact that was only disclosed in legalese, buried within the end user license agreement. The FTC secured a consent decree in the case.

==== Money Now Funding / Cash4Businesses case ====
In September 2013, a federal court closed an elusive business opportunity scheme on the request of the FTC, namely &quot;Money Now Funding&quot;/&quot;Cash4Businesses&quot;. The FTC alleged that the defendants misrepresented potential earnings, violated the National Do Not Call Register, and violated the FTC&#x27;s Business Opportunity Rule in preventing a fair consumer evaluation of the business. This was one of the first definitive actions taken by any regulator against a company engaging in transaction laundering, where almost US$6 million were processed illicitly.

In December 2018, two defendants, Nikolas Mihilli and Dynasty Merchants, LLC, settled with the FTC. They were banned from processing credit card transactions, though the initial monetary judgment of $5.8 million was suspended due to the defendant&#x27;s inability to pay.

==== OMICS Publishing Group case ====
In 2016, the FTC launched action against the academic journal publisher OMICS Publishing Group for producing predatory journals and organizing predatory conferences. This action, partly in response to ongoing pressure from the academic community, is the first action taken by the FTC against an academic journal publisher.

The complaint alleges that the defendants have been &quot;deceiving academics and researchers about the nature of its publications and hiding publication fees ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars&quot;. It additionally notes that &quot;OMICS regularly advertises conferences featuring academic experts who were never scheduled to appear in order to attract registrants&quot; and that attendees &quot;spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on registration fees and travel costs to attend these scientific conferences.&quot; Manuscripts are also sometimes held hostage, with OMICS refusing to allow submissions to be withdrawn and thereby preventing resubmission to another journal for consideration. Library scientist Jeffrey Beall has described OMICS as among the most egregious of predatory publishers. In November 2017, a federal court in the Court for the District of Nevada granted a preliminary injunction that: 

In April 2019, the court imposed a fine of US$50.1 million on OMICS companies for unfair and deceptive business practices.

=== Activities in the healthcare industry ===

In addition to prospective analysis of the effects of mergers and acquisitions, the FTC has recently resorted to retrospective analysis and monitoring of consolidated hospitals. Thus, it also uses retroactive data to demonstrate that some hospital mergers and acquisitions are hurting consumers, particularly in terms of higher prices. Here are some recent examples of the FTC&#x27;s success in blocking or unwinding of hospital consolidations or affiliations:

==== Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital and Palmyra Medical Center in Georgia ====
In April 2011, the FTC successfully challenged in court the $195 million acquisition of Palmyra Medical Center by Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital. The FTC alleged that the transaction would create a monopoly as it would &quot;reduce competition significantly and allow the combined Phoebe/Palmyra to raise prices for general acute-care hospital services charged to commercial health plans, substantially harming patients and local employers and employees&quot;. The Supreme Court on February 19, 2013, ruled in favor of the FTC.

==== ProMedica health system and St. Luke&#x27;s hospital in Ohio ====
Similarly, court attempts by ProMedica health system in Ohio to overturn an order by the FTC to the company to unwind its 2010 acquisition of St. Luke&#x27;s hospital were unsuccessful. The FTC claimed that the acquisition would hurt consumers through higher premiums because insurance companies would be required to pay more. In December 2011, an administrative judge upheld the FTC&#x27;s decision, noting that the behavior of ProMedica health system and St. Luke&#x27;s was indeed anticompetitive. The court ordered ProMedica to divest St. Luke&#x27;s to a buyer that would be approved by the FTC within 180 days of the date of the order.

==== OSF healthcare system and Rockford Health System in Illinois====
In November 2011, the FTC filed a lawsuit alleging that the proposed acquisition of Rockford by OSF would drive up prices for general acute-care inpatient services as OSF would face only one competitor (SwedishAmerican health system) in the Rockford area and would have a market share of 64%. Later in 2012, OSF announced that it had abandoned its plans to acquire Rockford Health System.
=== First Trump administration ===
==== Meta antitrust acquisitions case ====

In December 2020, the FTC sued Meta (formally known as Facebook) for anticompetitive conduct under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits improper monopolization of a market. The FTC accused Meta of buying up its competitors to stifle competition which reduced the range of services available to consumers and by creating fewer social media platforms for advertisers to target.
=== Biden administration ===
The FTC was chaired by Lina Khan during the Biden Administration. 

==== Google ====
In November 2024, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta agreed with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter and FTC Chair Khan, ruling the company a monopoly, and ordering Google to sell its Chrome web browser.

==== Banning non-compete clauses ====
The FTC ruled to ban virtually all non-competes nationwide in April 2024. The agency estimates 30 million workers are bound by these clauses and only excludes senior executives from the ban on enforcing non-competes. The agency believes that this will allow workers to find better working conditions and pay, since switching companies, on average, provides the biggest pay raises. It also allows workers to leave abusive work environments and can prevent some doctors from having to leave medicine once they leave a practice. The ban was put on hold by U.S. District Judge Ada Brown on July 3, 2024, but then upheld on appeal by U.S. District Judge Kelley B. Hodge on July 23, 2024. On August 20, 2024, a federal court in Texas overturned the FTC&#x27;s ban on non-compete agreements, which was originally scheduled to take effect on September 4, 2024. U.S. District Judge Ada Brown said the FTC did not have the authority to issue the ban, which she said was &quot;unreasonably overbroad without a reasonable explanation.&quot; Victoria Graham, an FTC spokeswoman responded to the ruling by stating &quot;We are seriously considering a potential appeal...&quot;

==== Chip manufacturers ====
The FTC successfully blocked Nvidia from purchasing Arm Holdings in 2022.

==== Pharmaceutical drug prices ====
The FTC has pursued lawsuits against companies to lower drug prices, including for insulin and for inhalers.

The FTC launched its investigation into pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in 2022. In July 2024, it released an interim report on its 2-year investigation into pharmacy benefit managers, the agency requested documents from the six largest PBMs as part of its investigation. The three largest – UnitedHealth Group&#x27;s OptumRx, Cigna&#x27;s Express Scripts and CVS Health&#x27;s Caremark – manage about 80% of U.S. prescriptions. The top three PBMs share a parent company with a large medical insurance company. The FTC accused these companies of raising drug prices through conflicts of interest, vertical integration, concentration, and exclusivity provisions; the agency also alleged that the companies created a rebate system that prioritized high rebates from drug manufacturers, among other factors. The agency stated that several PBMs failed to provide documents in a timely manner and warned that it could take the companies to court to force them to comply, during the announcment in the preliminary findings. In September 2024, the FTC sued the three largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) for allegedly engaging in anti-competitive practices that increased their profits while artificially inflating the list price of insulin. The agency is seeking to prohibit the PBMs from favoring medicines because certain pharaceuticals make them more money.

==== Fake online reviews ====
In August 2024, the FTC announced it would finalize rules to ban fake reviews online.

==== Food prices ====
In February 2024, the FTC challenged the Kroger-Albertsons merger, arguing it would drive up grocery and pharmacy prices, worsen service, and lower wages and working conditions. On December 10, 2024, U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson agreed with the FTC, that the merger would risk reducing competition at the expense of both consumers and workers. Judge Nelson halted Kroger’s $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons with a preliminary injunction. 

In March 2024, the FTC released a report that found higher profit margins as a driver of inflation for grocery prices.

In August 2024, it announced it would be probing grocery prices to look for anti-competitive behavior and price gouging at chain supermarkets. 

==== Junk fees and high prices ====
In October 2023, the FTC proposed a new rule that would ensure that the cancellation process of subscription services is as easy as the process of signing up. On October 16, 2024, the FTC announced the new rule, dubbed &quot;click to cancel&quot;, requiring companies to make subscription services &quot;as easy for consumers to cancel their enrollment as it was to sign up.&quot; Khan said in an interview that the new rule is designed so that if consumers signed up online, they must also be able to cancel on the same website in the same number of steps. The rule’s final provisions will go into effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register.

It also targeted airlines and credit card companies over junk fees and high prices.

==== Microsoft merger ====
In October 2023, the FTC authorized an administrative complaint against the merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard, Inc. The FTC alleged the deal would suppress competitors from accessing future content/games developed by Activision once the deal goes through. The FTC dropped its lawsuit on July 20, 2023. Microsoft had to restructure its deal to appease UK regulators. Microsoft reneged on promises it made in court filings by laying off 1900 employees in January 2024, signaling that it did not plan to let Activision Blizzard remain as independent as it had promised and leading the FTC to continue to appeal the decision.

==== Right to repair ====
In July 2021, the FTC voted unanimously to enforce the right to repair as policy and to look to take action against companies that limit the type of repair work that can be done at independent repair shops. In October 2024, following a comment by the FTC to the US Copyright Office, an exemption was granted allowing for repair of retail-level food preparation equipment, such as McDonald&#x27;s ice cream machines.

== Organization ==
=== Current members of the FTC ===
The commission is headed by five commissioners, who each serve seven-year terms. Commissioners are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. No more than three commissioners can be of the same political party. In practice, this means that two commissioners are of the opposition party. However, three members of the FTC throughout its history have been without party affiliation, with the most recent independent, Pamela Jones Harbour, serving from 2003 to 2009.

Notes
* The FTC Act allows commissioners to remain in their position after their term expires until a replacement has been appointed.

=== Backgrounds of commissioners ===
As of 2021, there have been:

* Three African-Americans to serve on the FTC: A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. (served from 1962 to 1964), Mozelle W. Thompson (served from 1997 to 2004), Pamela Jones Harbour (served from 2003 to 2009)
* Three Asian-Americans to serve on the FTC: Dennis Yao (served from 1991 to 1994), Rohit Chopra (served from 2018 to 2021), and Lina Khan (served since 2021); Khan is the first Asian-American to serve as FTC Chair
* Three independents to serve on the FTC: Philip Elman (served from 1961 to 1970), Mary Azcuenaga (served from 1984 to 1998), and Pamela Jones Harbour (served from 2003 to 2009)

=== Bureaus ===

§The FTC has three main bureaus: the Bureau of Competition, the Bureau of Consumer Protection, and the Bureau of Economics.

==== Bureau of Competition ====
The Bureau of Competition is the division of the FTC charged with elimination and prevention of &quot;anticompetitive&quot; business practices. It accomplishes this through the enforcement of antitrust laws, review of proposed mergers, and investigation into other non-merger business practices that may impair competition. Such non-merger practices include horizontal restraints, involving agreements between direct competitors, and vertical restraints, involving agreements among businesses at different levels in the same industry (such as suppliers and commercial buyers).

The FTC shares enforcement of antitrust laws with the Department of Justice. However, while the FTC is responsible for civil enforcement of antitrust laws, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has the power to bring both civil and criminal action in antitrust matters.

==== Bureau of Consumer Protection ====
The Bureau of Consumer Protection&#x27;s mandate is to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in commerce. With the written consent of the commission, Bureau attorneys enforce federal laws related to consumer affairs and rules promulgated by the FTC. Its functions include investigations, enforcement actions, and consumer and business education. Areas of principal concern for this bureau are: advertising and marketing, financial products and practices, telemarketing fraud, privacy and identity protection, etc. The bureau also is responsible for the United States National Do Not Call Registry.

Under the FTC Act, the commission has the authority, in most cases, to bring its actions in federal court through its own attorneys. In some consumer protection matters, the FTC appears with, or supports, the U.S. Department of Justice.

==== Bureau of Economics ====
The Bureau of Economics was established to support the Bureau of Competition and Consumer Protection by providing expert knowledge related to the economic impacts of the FTC&#x27;s legislation and operation.

==== Other offices ====
* The FTC maintains an Office of Technology Research and Investigation to assist it in technology-related enforcement actions. 
* The FTC generally selects its Chief Technologist from among computer science academics and noted practitioners. The role has previously been filled by Steven K. Bellovin, Lorrie Cranor, Edward Felten, Ashkan Soltani, and Latanya Sweeney. 
* The FTC also maintains an academic in residence program, inviting leading legal scholars to join the FTC for a year as a Senior Policy Advisor. The role has been held by Tim Wu in 2011, Paul Ohm in 2012, and Andrea M. Matwyshyn in 2014.

== Activities ==

The FTC investigates issues raised by reports from consumers and businesses, pre-merger notification filings, congressional inquiries, or reports in the media. These issues include, for instance, false advertising and other forms of fraud. FTC investigations may pertain to a single company or an entire industry. If the results of the investigation reveal unlawful conduct, the FTC may seek voluntary compliance by the offending business through a consent order, file an administrative complaint, or initiate federal litigation. During the course of regulatory activities, the FTC is authorized to collect records, but not on-site inspections.

Traditionally an administrative complaint is heard in front of an independent administrative law judge (ALJ) with FTC staff acting as prosecutors. The case is reviewed &quot;de novo&quot; by the full FTC commission which then may be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals and finally to the Supreme Court.

Under the FTC Act, the federal courts retain their traditional authority to issue equitable relief, including the appointment of receivers, monitors, the imposition of asset freezes to guard against the spoliation of funds, immediate access to business premises to preserve evidence, and other relief including financial disclosures and expedited discovery. In numerous cases, the FTC employs this authority to combat serious consumer deception or fraud. Additionally, the FTC has rulemaking power to address concerns regarding industry-wide practices. Rules promulgated under this authority are known as &quot;Trade Rules&quot;.

One of the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s other major focuses is identity theft. The FTC serves as a federal repository for individual consumer complaints regarding identity theft. Even though the FTC does not resolve individual complaints, it does use the aggregated information to determine where federal action might be taken. The complaint form is available online or by phone (1-877-ID-THEFT).

The FTC has been involved in the oversight of the online advertising industry and its practice of behavioral targeting for some time. In 2011 the FTC proposed a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; mechanism to allow Internet users to opt-out of behavioral targeting.

The FTC, along with the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Justice also empowers third-party enforcer-firms to engage in some regulatory oversight, e.g. the FTC requires other energy companies to audit offshore oil platform operators.

In 2013, the FTC issued a comprehensive revision of its Green guides, which set forth standards for environmental marketing.

=== Unfair or deceptive practices affecting consumers ===

Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, grants the FTC power to investigate and prevent &quot;deceptive&quot; trade practices. The statute declares that &quot;unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful.&quot;

Unfairness and deception towards consumers represent two distinct areas of FTC enforcement and authority. The FTC also has authority over unfair methods of competition between businesses.

==== Definitions of unfairness ====
Courts have identified three main factors that must be considered in consumer unfairness cases: (1) whether the practice injures consumers; (2) whether the practice violates established public policy; and (3) whether it is unethical or unscrupulous.

==== Definitions of deception ====
In a letter to the Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, the FTC defined the elements of deception cases. First, &quot;there must be a representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the consumer.&quot; In the case of omissions, the Commission considers the implied representations understood by the consumer.

A misleading omission occurs when information is not disclosed to correct reasonable consumer expectations. Second, the Commission examines the practice from the perspective of a reasonable consumer being targeted by the practice. Finally the representation or omission must be a material onethat is one that would have changed consumer behavior.

===== Dot Com Disclosures guide =====
In its Dot Com Disclosures guide, the FTC said that &quot;disclosures that are required to prevent deception or to provide consumers material information about a transaction must be presented clearly and conspicuously.&quot; The FTC suggested a number of different factors that would help determine whether the information was &quot;clear and conspicuous&quot; including but not limited to: 
*the placement of the disclosure in an advertisement and its proximity to the claim it is qualifying,
*the prominence of the disclosure,
*whether items in other parts of the advertisement distract attention from the disclosure,
*whether the advertisement is so lengthy that the disclosure needs to be repeated,
*whether disclosures in audio messages are presented in an adequate volume and cadence and visual disclosures appear for a sufficient duration, and 
*whether the language of the disclosure is understandable to the intended audience.
However, the &quot;key is the overall net impression.&quot;

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Wataru Yoshizumi. It was published in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazine &quot;Ribon&quot; from May 1992 to October 1995 and collected in eight &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes. The series was adapted by Toei Animation as a 76-episode anime television series which aired on TV Asahi in 1994 to 1995. This was followed by a prequel theatrical anime movie in 1995. The series was also adapted as a 30-episode live-action television series that was broadcast in Taiwan in 2002. A live-action film adaptation was released in Japan by Warner Bros. Pictures on April 27, 2018.

==Plot==
Miki Koishikawa&#x27;s ordinary life as a sophomore in high school is turned upside down when her parents suddenly announce that they are getting divorced in order to swap partners with a couple they met back in Hawaii. When Miki says she doesn&#x27;t want to choose who of the two she moves with, her parents tell her not to worry about that because they also plan to move in to a big house with the other couple and their son. They seek her approval of the shocking change, and while at a restaurant during dinner where Miki meets the other couple as well as their teenage son Yuu Matsura, who is around her age, she reluctantly agrees to the arrangement. At first, Yuu appears to be a complete jerk who takes every opportunity to make fun of and tease Miki, but he actually turns out to be fun and attractive, and Miki finds herself falling in love with him. Little by little, she accepts her new family arrangement and opens up to Yuu as they become best friends.

After a while, Miki and Yuu&#x27;s relationship starts to become complicated because of the former relationships that they&#x27;ve had and developed with other characters. These include Miki&#x27;s long time classmate and former crush from middle school, Ginta Suou, and Yuu&#x27;s former girlfriend from his previous school, Arimi Suzuki. A secondary subplot develops when Miki&#x27;s best friend, Meiko Akizuki, herself starts to have her own problems because of the relationship she has gotten into with one of the school teachers, Shin&#x27;ichi Namura.

Throughout the series, Miki and Yuu&#x27;s relationship is further developed and tried, influenced by the other characters around them and the relationships that they develop with these characters.

==Characters==
The cast of &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; is diverse and largely defined by their relationships with Miki Koishikawa and Yuu Matsuura. Although the relationship between these two protagonists is the primary focus of the series, many of the supporting characters are also well-developed.

==Production==
When Wataru Yoshizumi first started planning &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot;, Miki, Yuu, Ginta, and Meiko were all the opposite genders of what they ended up being in the final versions, and Miki&#x27;s original design looked similar to Yuu&#x27;s final appearance, while Yuu was an attractive girl with long black hair and a &quot;devilish&quot; and &quot;unpredictable&quot; personality. Yoshizumi notes several reasons behind the changes. Part of the reason was that it was a request from the &quot;Ribon&quot; publishers, who wanted a female as the central character as the story was going to be included in a &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; set with magnets featuring the characters. Her associate editor also expressed concerns that a male hero would be a &quot;sissy&quot; when written about by a female writer. Finally, Yoshizumi herself decided that she would go with a heroine rather than a hero as most of the &quot;Ribon&quot; readers are girls.

In the original story, the title of &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; was an indication of the hero Miki&#x27;s cheerful, sweet, and naive nature. After redoing the concept, she wanted to keep the original title, changing its meaning to what is stated in the first volume, that Yuu &quot;has lots of bitter bits inside&quot; him but people only see his sweet surface.

The ending for the series was also very different from the final version. Ginta and Arimi were not going to be a couple in the original version, nor was Meiko going to be reunited with Namura. Yoshizumi originally intended for Miki and Yuu to truly be blood siblings, and thus have to break up. Afterwards, Ginta would comfort Miki and promise to wait for her to get over Yuu. Yuu and Meiko would have been shown meeting four years later, having both failed in their previous relationships. The ending would have been more open-ended so readers would have had to wonder what really would happen to everyone. However, as she was writing the third chapter, Yoshizumi became less certain of the ending, as it made Miki and Yuu&#x27;s parents appear to be awful people for doing such a thing to their children. She also was concerned about how readers would react, and her own feelings of &quot;emptiness&quot; at the sad ending. Her editor agreed that the ending would be bad, so she changed it to the happier one now found in the series.

==Media==

===Manga===

&quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; first premiered in the May 1992 issue of &quot;Ribon&quot; where it was serialized monthly until its conclusion in the October 1995 issue. The 39 untitled chapters were collected and published in eight &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Shueisha starting on December 12, 1992; the last volume was released February 20, 1996. Shueisha later republished the series in six special edition volumes. The first special edition volume was released on March 15, 2004, with new volumes published monthly until the final volume was released on August 11, 2004.

The series was licensed for an English language release in North America by Tokyopop. The individual chapters were serialized by the company&#x27;s manga anthology &quot;Smile&quot; from December 2001 through April 2002. Tokyopop released the first collected volume of the series on April 23, 2002, releasing new volumes monthly until the final volume was released August 5, 2003. It was one of the first manga series that Tokyopop released in the original Japanese orientation, in which the book is read from right to left, and with the original sound effects left in place. Tokyopop&#x27;s volumes of the series are out of print. Shueisha refused to renew the company&#x27;s license of the series after becoming part-owner of rival publisher Viz Media. At Anime Expo 2022, Seven Seas Entertainment announced that they licensed the series for English publication in collector&#x27;s edition format. It is also licensed for regional language releases in France by Glenat, in Mexico by Grupo Editorial Vid, in Spain by Planeta DeAgostini Comics, in Italy by Planet Manga, and in Germany by Egmont.

From March 2013 to September 2018, a sequel to &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; titled was serialized in &quot;Cocohana&quot;. While Miki and Yuu make appearances, the new series, set 13 years after the end of the earlier one, focuses on Rikka Matsuura and Saku Koishikawa, Yuu and Miki&#x27;s respective sister and brother.

===Novels===

&quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; was adapted into a series of Japanese light novels by Yumi Kageyama, with Wataru Yoshizumi acting as illustrator. The ten volume series was published under Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Cobalt Bunko&quot; label from July 1994 through March 1996.




===Anime===
Toei Animation adapted &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; into a 76-episode anime television series which aired on TV Asahi in 1994 to 1995. This was followed by a prequel theatrical anime movie in 1995. The anime series was licensed for Region 1 DVD release by Tokyopop, which released the series in four box sets. Tokyopop&#x27;s license had since expired, leaving the anime out of print, until May 6, 2017, when Discotek Media announced they had licensed the anime, and would release the series in two DVD sets. The first set (episodes 1-38) has been released on August 29, 2017, and the second set (episodes 39–76) on November 28, 2017. An SD on BD Set has been announced for 2018.

The movie for the anime acts as a prequel to the story. Taking place as a flashback after Yuu kisses Miki in the nurse&#x27;s office, he recalls the first time he met Miki, shortly after his parents told him of their impending divorce and spouse swap. He found Miki practicing tennis in the park and spent the rest of the day following her around, eventually finding out she was to be his new stepsister. According to this movie, Yuu was in love with Miki before the family&#x27;s meeting. The second Discotek set, as well as the upcoming SD on BD set has the movie packaged in there.

===Art books===
*&quot;Marmalade Boy: Koi no Style Book&quot;, ISBN
*&quot;Marmalade Boy: Yoshizumi Wataru Illust-shū&quot;, 

===Games===
&quot;Marmalade Boy&quot;, a dating simulation video game was released by Bandai Entertainment for the Nintendo Game Boy system in Japan on January 27, 1995. Based on the manga, the game puts players in the role of Miki, who must try to win the heart of one of her three potential suitors from the series: Yuu, Ginta, or Kei. It was released for the Super Famicom system on April 21, 1995. On release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the Super Famicom version of the game a 24 out of 40, giving the Game Boy version a 20 out of 40.

===Live-action television series===
In Taiwan, &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; was made into a 30-episode live-action television series called 橘子醬男孩 (pinyin: Júzǐjiāng Nánhái). The series starred pop star Stella as Miki and F4 member Ken Zhu as Yuu; Stella also sang the theme song, &quot;溫室的花 Wēnshì de Huā (Greenhouse Flower)&quot;. Although the basic premise was the same, it did not feature many of the characters of the anime, and the love triangles were considerably simplified.

==Reception==
The English translation of the manga was given a B+ rating by Jason Sondhi of Anime News Network, calling it a classic lighthearted shōjo romance that&#x27;s sweet and endearing and compulsively readable. Sondhi notes that &quot;&quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; is a wholly engaging read that does not demand as much in terms of time or money as many longer shōjo titles. Yes, it is clichéd, and yes, there is never any doubt in how the story will eventually turn out, but yes, you will enjoy following it nonetheless.&quot;

Serialized in Tokyopop&#x27;s &quot;Smile&quot; back in 2001, then collected in 2002, Wataru Yoshizumi&#x27;s &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot; helped introduce English language readers to the kind of situation found in shoujo manga, with its story of a pair of teens brought together when their parents swap spouses. The manga has over 10 million copies in print.

Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Reviews gave the anime a rating of 4 out of 5 stars. He praised the story for being engaging, the characters for being very memorable, the voice acting, the soundtrack, and the character designs for being a very faithful rendition of Wataru Yoshizumi&#x27;s original designs for the manga. However, he criticized the show&#x27;s low-budget animation, the third season of the anime, and the scriptwriters for an apparent lack of geographical knowledge of the New York metropolitan area, which is where the third season is primarily set. Overall, Ross concludes that &quot;Yes, I like my NCAA football, and I like my action anime. But after watching the entire series of &quot;Marmalade Boy&quot;, I am genuinely hooked. And I can understand the appeal of this series on a wide level to a mostly female audience. Let&#x27;s face it, this is a darn good show.&quot;

<text>The Changbai Mountains () are a major mountain range in East Asia that extends from the Northeast Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, across the China-North Korea border (41°41&#x27; to 42°51&#x27;N; 127°43&#x27; to 128°16&#x27;E), to the North Korean provinces of Ryanggang and Chagang. They are also referred to as the Šanggiyan Mountains in the Manchu language, or the [[Baekdu-daegan|Great Paekdu]] in Korean. Most of its peaks exceed in height, with the tallest summit being Paektu Mountain at , which contains the Heaven Lake, the highest volcanic crater lake in the world at a surface elevation of . The protected area Longwanqun National Forest Park is located within the vicinity of the mountain range.

==History==

The mountain was first recorded in the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; under the name Buxian Shan (). It is also called Shanshan Daling () in the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;. In the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, it was called Taibai Shan (). The current Chinese name Changbai Shan was first used in the Liao dynasty (916–1125) of the Khitans and then the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) of the Jurchens.
The range represents the mythical birthplace of Bukūri Yongšon, ancestor of Nurhaci and the Aisin Gioro imperial family, who were the founders of the Qing dynasty of China. The Chinese name literally means &quot;Perpetually-White Mountain Region&quot;. The imperial family regarded the mountain as their traditional homeland.

The Qing emperor Hong Taiji claimed that their progenitor, Bukūri Yongšon (布庫里雍順), was conceived from a virgin birth. According to the legend, three heavenly maidens, namely Enggulen (恩古倫), Jenggulen (正古倫) and Fekulen (佛庫倫), were bathing at a lake called Bulhūri Omo near the Changbai Mountains. A magpie dropped a piece of red fruit near Fekulen, who ate it. She then became pregnant with Bukūri Yongšon. However, another older version of the story by the Hurha (Hurka) tribe member Muksike recorded in 1635 contradicts Hongtaiji&#x27;s version on location, claiming that it was in Heilongjiang province close to the Amur river where Bulhuri lake was located where the &quot;heavenly maidens&quot; took their bath. Nowadays the famous Yabuli Ski Resort is located in the Changbai Mountains.

==Geography and climate==
The mountains are the source of the Songhua, Tumen, and Yalu Rivers.

The Changbai Mountains are characterized by long, cold winters. Precipitation is low in winter, but higher in the summer and fall, with annual averages reaching as high as .

==Flora and fauna==
The vegetation of the mountain slopes is divided into several different zones. At the top, above , tundra predominates. From , vegetation is dominated by mountain birch and larch. Below this zone, and down to , the dominant trees are spruce, fir, and pine. From , the landscape is dominated by mixed forest consisting of Amur linden (&quot;Tilia amurensis&quot;), pine, maple, and elm. Further down, a temperate hardwood forest is found, dominated by second-growth poplar and birch.
There are five known species of plants in the lake on the peak, and some 168 have been counted along its shores. The forest on the Chinese side is ancient and almost unaltered by humans. Birch predominates near the tree line, and pine lower down, mixed with other species. There has been extensive deforestation on the lower slopes on the North Korean side of the mountain.

The area is a known habitat for Siberian tigers, bears, wolves, and wild boars. The Ussuri dholes may have been extirpated from the area. Deer in the mountain forests, which cover the mountain up to about , are of the Paekdusan roe deer kind. Many wild birds such as black grouse, owls, and woodpecker are known to inhabit the area. The mountain has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports a population of scaly-sided mergansers.

<text>Wellington College of Education (formerly Wellington Teachers&#x27; Training College) was established in 1888 with the purpose of educating teachers in New Zealand. It became the Faculty of Education of Victoria University of Wellington, formed from the School of Education (of the Faculty of Humanities of Social Sciences) of the University, and the Wellington College of Education on 1 January 2005.

From 1968 to 2016, it occupied an architecturally award winning campus in the Wellington suburb of Karori, designed by local architect William Toomath. The campus was awarded an NZIA Silver Medal (1972), and an NZIA Local Award (Enduring Architecture) (2005). The campus had many facilities including a &quot;marae&quot; called Ako Pai Marae that was closed in 2016.

==About==
Wellington Teachers’ Training College had a 125th anniversary in 2005, the College having been originally established in 1880.

A decision to expand the teacher training facilities in Wellington was made in the 1930s, however it was not until 1966 that the building of the Karori campus began. There were teacher training reforms in the mid-twentieth centenary that were triggered by increased populations after World War Two. The campus was architecturally significant and had a Category 1 rating by Heritage New Zealand. It was transferred from the Ministry of Education to Victoria University of Wellington in 2004 for $10. It was sold by Victoria University of Wellington to Ryman Healthcare in 2017 for $28 million. Two of the heritage buildings were subsequently planned for demolition as part of the development by Ryman&#x27;s, with Historic Places Wellington stating this would be a &quot;significant cultural loss&quot;. A local group proposed the hall and cafeteria be retained for community use.The faculty has had many notable teachers and students over its long history, significantly in New Zealand’s education system, arts sector and Māori rights movement.

Māori studies was introduced in 1963 with the appointment of Barry Mitcalfe in the Department of Social Studies. Tīpene O&#x27;Reagan joined Mitcalfe in 1968 and then redesigned the programme in 1972 when Mitcalfe left.

Author David McGill, who attended in the early 1960s, says of his experience: As students, we all wore desert boots, fishermen&#x27;s knit jerseys. We&#x27;d go to cafes and pubs. Barrett&#x27;s was the nearest pub, or the George. Girls weren&#x27;t allowed into pubs, so we&#x27;d go into coffee bars with them. Those were the days, at that wonderful teachers&#x27; college in Karori, with liberal teachers like Jack Shallcrass.Wellington Teachers Training College was renamed the Wellington College of Education in 1988 in line with government policy.

<text>Salford ( ) is a city in Greater Manchester, England, on the western bank of the River Irwell which forms its boundary with Manchester city centre. Landmarks include the former town hall, Salford Cathedral, Salford Lads&#x27; Club and St Philip&#x27;s Church. In 2021 it had a population of 129,794. The demonym for people from Salford is &quot;Salfordian&quot;.

Salford is the main settlement of the wider City of Salford metropolitan borough, which incorporates Eccles, Pendlebury, Swinton and Walkden.

Salford was named in the Early Middle Ages, though evidence exists of settlement since Neolithic times. It was the seat of the large Hundred of Salford in the historic county of Lancashire and was granted a market charter in about 1230, which gave it primary cultural and commercial importance in the region. It was eventually overtaken by Manchester during the Industrial Revolution. The former County Borough of Salford was granted city status in 1926; the current wider borough was established in 1974. 

The economy of the city in the 18th and 19th centuries was focused on a major factory district for cotton and silk spinning and weaving, and as a major inland port after the opening of Salford Docks in 1894. Industrial decline in the 20th century led to the city having run-down and antisocial areas. Salford has been subject to slum clearances and other regeneration programmes since the 1930s. From 2007, multiple media companies set up headquarters at the MediaCityUK development in Salford Quays, an area established in the 1980s on former dockland. Organisations in the city include the University of Salford, Salford City Football Club, Salford Red Devils, BBC North and ITV Granada.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name of Salford derives from , meaning a ford by the willows, (also known as sallows), in reference to the trees growing on the banks of the River Irwell. The ford was about where Victoria Bridge is today. Willow trees are still found in Lower Broughton. Salford appears in the pipe roll of 1169 as &quot;Sauford&quot; and in the Lancashire Inquisitions of 1226 as &quot;Sainford&quot;.

===Early history===

The earliest known evidence of human activity in what is now Salford is provided by the Neolithic flint arrow-heads and workings discovered on Kersal Moor and the River Irwell, suggesting that the area was inhabited 7–10,000 years ago. The raw material for such tools was scarce and unsuitable for working, and as a result they are not of the quality found elsewhere. Other finds include a neolithic axe-hammer found near Mode Wheel, during the excavation of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1890, and a Bronze Age cremation urn during the construction of a road on the Broughton Hall estate in 1873.

The Brigantes were the major Celtic tribe in what is now Northern England. With a stronghold at the sandstone outcrop on which Manchester Cathedral now stands, opposite Salford&#x27;s original centre, their territory extended across the fertile lowland by the River Irwell that is now Salford and Stretford. Following the Roman conquest of Britain, General Agricola ordered the construction of a Roman fort named &quot;Mamucium&quot; (Manchester) to protect the routes to &quot;Deva Victrix&quot; (Chester) and &quot;Eboracum&quot; (York) from the Brigantes. Salford was founded when the fort was completed in AD 79, and for over 300 years the &quot;Pax Romana&quot; brought peace to the area. Both the main Roman road to the north, from Mamucium to Ribchester, and a second road to the west, ran through what is now Salford, but few Roman artefacts have been found in the area. The withdrawal of the Romans in AD 410 left the inhabitants at the mercy of the Saxons. The Danes later conquered the area and absorbed what was left of the Brigantes. 

===Middle Ages===
Angles settled in the region during the Early Middle Ages and gave the locality the name &quot;Sealhford&quot;, meaning &quot;ford by the willows&quot;. According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Sealhford&quot; was part of the Kingdom of Northumbria until it was conquered in 923 by Edward the Elder.

Following the emergence of the united Kingdom of England, Salford became a caput or central manor within a broad rural area in part held by the Kings of England, including Edward the Confessor. The area between the rivers Mersey and Ribble was divided into six smaller districts, referred to as &quot;wapentakes&quot;, or hundreds. The south east district became known as the Hundred of Salford, a division of land administered from Salford for military and judicial purposes. It contained nine large parishes, smaller parts of two others, and the township of Aspull in the parish of Wigan.

After the defeat of Harold II during the Norman conquest of England, William I granted the Hundred of Salford to Roger the Poitevin, and in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 the Hundred of Salford was recorded as covering an area of with a population of 35,000. Poitevin created the subordinate Manor of Manchester out of the hundred, which has since in local government been separate from Salford. Poitevin forfeited the manor in 1102 when he was defeated in a failed rebellion attempt against Henry I. In around 1115, for their support during the rebellion, Henry I placed the Hundred of Salford under the control of the Earldom of Lancaster, and it is from this exchange that the Hundred of Salford became a royal manor. The Lord of the Manor was either the English monarch, or a feudal land owner who administered the manor for the king. During the reign of Henry II the Royal Manor of Salford passed to Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester.
Salford began to emerge as a small town early in the 13th century. In 1228, Henry III granted the caput of Salford the right to hold a market and an annual fair. The fairs were important to the town; a 17th-century order forced each burgess – a freeman of the borough – to attend, but the fairs were abolished during the 19th century. The Earls of Chester aided the development of the caput, and in 1230 Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester made Salford a burgage, or free borough. The charter gave its burgesses certain commercial rights, privileges and advantages over traders living outside Salford; one of the 26 clauses of the charter stated that no one could work in the Hundred of Salford unless they also lived in the borough. Salford&#x27;s status as a burgage encouraged an influx of distinguished families, and by the Late Middle Ages Salford was &quot;rich in its manor houses&quot;, with over 30 within a radius of Ordsall. These included Ordsall Hall (owned by the Radclyffe family) and Broughton Hall, owned by the Earls of Derby.

===Early Modern period===
During the Civil War of 1640–1649, Salford supported the Royalist cause, in contrast to Manchester just across the Irwell which declared in favour of the Parliamentarians. Royalist forces mounted a siege of Manchester across what is now the site of Victoria Bridge, which although short-lived, &quot;did little to improve relations between the two towns&quot;. A century later, in 1745, Salford was staunchly in support of Bonnie Prince Charlie, in his attempt to seize the Throne of England. He entered the town at the head of his army and was blessed by the Reverend John Clayton before leaving &quot;in high spirits&quot; to march on London; he returned to Salford in defeat just nine days later.

Salford has a history of textile processing that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700 years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution had a profound effect on both on population and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.

===Industrial Revolution===

The well-established textile processing and trading infrastructure, and the ready supply of water from the River Irwell and its tributaries, attracted entrepreneurs who built cotton mills along the banks of the river in Pendleton and Ordsall. Although Salford followed a similar pattern of industrial development to Manchester, most businesses preferred to build their premises on the Manchester side of the Irwell, and consequently Salford did not develop as a commercial centre in the same way as its neighbour. Many of these earlier mills had been based on Arkwright-type designs. These relied on strong falls of water, but Salford is on a meander of the Irwell with only a slight gradient and thus mills tended to be built upstream, at Kersal and Pendleton. However, with the introduction of the steam engine in the late 18th century, merchants began to construct mills closer to the centres of Salford and Manchester, where supplies of labour and coal were more readily available (the first steam-powered mill was built in Manchester in 1780). One of the first factories to be built was Philip&#x27;s and Lee&#x27;s Twist Mill in Salford, completed in 1801, the second iron-framed multi-story building to be erected in Britain. The large Salford Engine Twist Company mill was built to the west of Salford, between Chapel Street and the Irwell, and in 1806 was the first large cotton mill to use gas lighting. Many engineering companies were established in this area, including Samuel Ellis and Company at the Irwell Foundry. However, it was outnumbered by the numerous smaller factories and mills throughout the area, including Nathan Gough&#x27;s steam-driven mule spinning mill, near Oldfield Road, where a serious accident occurred on 13 October 1824 (see illustration).

Canal building provided a further stimulus for Salford&#x27;s industrial development. The opening of the Bridgewater Canal in 1761 improved the transport of fuel and raw materials, reducing the price of coal by about 50%. The later Manchester, Bolton &amp; Bury Canal (which terminated at Salford) brought more cheap coal from pits at Pendleton, Agecroft Colliery and beyond. By 1818 Manchester, Salford and Eccles had about 80 mills, but it was the completion of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894 which triggered Salford&#x27;s development as a major inland port. Salford Docks, a major dockland on the Ship Canal east of the Irish Sea, brought employment to over 3,000 labourers. By 1914 the Port of Manchester, most of whose docks were in Salford, had become one of the largest port authorities in the world, handling 5% of the UK&#x27;s imports and 4.4% of its exports. Commodities handled included cotton, grain, wool, textile machinery and steam locomotives.

For centuries, textiles and related trades were the main source of employment in the town. Bleaching was a widely distributed finishing trade in Salford, carried over from the earlier woollen industry. In the 18th century, before the introduction of chemical bleaching, bleaching fields were commonplace, some very close to the town. In 1773 there were 25 bleachers around Salford, most to the west of the township. Printing was another source of trade; the earliest recorded in the region was a calique printer in the Manchester Parish Register of 1763. These industries became more important as Salford faced increasing competition from the nearby towns of Bolton and Oldham. As its cotton spinning industries faltered its economy turned increasingly to other textiles and to the finishing trades, including rexine and silk dyeing, and fulling and bleaching, at a string of works in Salford.
Both Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels spent time in Salford, studying the plight of the British working class. In &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844&quot;, Engels described Salford as &quot;really one large working-class quarter ... [a] very unhealthy, dirty and dilapidated district which, while other industries were almost always textile related is situated opposite the &#x27;Old Church&#x27; of Manchester&quot;.

The effect on Salford of the Industrial Revolution has been described as &quot;phenomenal&quot;. The area expanded from a small market town into a major industrial metropolis; factories replaced cottage industries, and the population rose from 12,000 in 1812 to 70,244 within 30 years. By the end of the 19th century it had increased to 220,000. Large-scale building of low quality Victorian terraced housing did not stop overcrowding, which itself led to chronic social deprivation. The density of housing was as high as 80 homes per acre. Private roads were built for the use of the middle classes moving to the outskirts of Salford. The entrances to such roads, which included Elleray Road in Irlams o&#x27; th&#x27; Height, were often gated, and patrolled.

====Inventions====
Salford is credited as the birthplace of the Bush Roller Chain. Hans Renold, a Swiss-born engineer, came to Salford in the late 19th century. In 1879 he purchased a small textile-chain making business in Ordsall from James Slater and founded the Hans Renold Company, what is now Renold, a firm which still produces chains. Renold invented the bush roller chain shortly after and began producing it. It is the type of chain most commonly used for transmission of mechanical power on bicycles, motorbikes, to industrial and agricultural machinery to uses as varied as rollercoasters and escalators.

===Post-industrial decline===

During the early 20th century, improvements in regional transport infrastructure precipitated the decline of Salford&#x27;s existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. Life in Salford during the early 20th century was described by Robert Roberts, in his study &quot;The Classic Slum&quot;. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s, and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed toward a fall in Salford&#x27;s population. 

By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and, by 1971, cotton spinning had ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.
A survey in 1931 concluded that parts of Salford contained some of the worst slums in the country. Many houses were infested by rats and lacked elementary amenities. Inspectors found that of 950 houses surveyed, 257 were in a state of bad repair with leaking roofs, broken flooring and rotten woodwork. The inspectors were &quot;struck by the courage and perseverance with which the greater number of tenants kept their houses clean and respectable under most adverse conditions&quot;. By 1933, slum clearance projects were under way, and by the end of 1956 over a thousand families had been rehoused in overspill estates at Little Hulton. These clearances have, for some, changed the character of the area to such an extent that &quot;observers in search of the typical Salford may have to look in Eccles and Swinton, for much of the community and townscape ... has gone from Salford, replaced by tall blocks of flats&quot;. Large areas of the city were redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, with Victorian era terraced housing estates that inspired painter L. S. Lowry and soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; giving way to concrete tower blocks and austere architecture. Salford Quays became the site of the second British multiplex when Cannon opened their cinema there in December 1986.

Despite extensive redevelopment, throughout the 1980s and 1990s the area experienced high levels of deprivation and unemployment, particularly during the recessions of the early years of both decades. This social deprivation was a major factor in the increased levels of gang crime linked to illegal narcotics, firearms and robberies. This was comparable to the similar issues faced in parts of neighbouring Manchester including Moss Side, as well as areas of the more distant neighbouring city of Liverpool.

Organised crime in Salford, particularly in Ordsall and Pendleton, &quot;began to have a disturbing effect on grass roots democracy. Both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives announced they would not contest certain Salford wards&quot; because they regarded them as &quot;unsafe&quot; and would put their &quot;party workers at risk&quot;. Salford&#x27;s social amenities and the night-time economy folded amid criminal &quot;intimidation&quot;, &quot;drug use, fights and demands for money&quot;. In early 2005, the Government of Latvia appealed to the European Union to advise people against travelling to Salford after a Latvian man was stabbed in the head in Lower Broughton. However, a crackdown by Greater Manchester Police coupled with investment in, and structural changes to the housing stock, began changing Salford&#x27;s fortunes; population decline has slowed, and Salford&#x27;s city councillors have insisted it is a safe place to visit. In August 2005, a survey by Channel 4 television rated the city as the 9th worst place to live in the United Kingdom, based on criteria of crime, education, environment, lifestyle and employment.

===Regeneration===

Salford has suffered from high levels of unemployment, housing, and social problems since around the 1960s, although there are regeneration schemes to reverse its fortunes. Many of the high-rise housing blocks from the 1960s and 1970s were demolished during the 1990s, &quot;a sign that the great social engineering schemes (from that period) had failed&quot;. However, the high-rises that remain are a striking feature of Salford&#x27;s landscape. Work was scheduled to begin on the £180 million redevelopment of the Greengate area of Salford in January 2007. The plans include the construction of what will be the two tallest tower blocks in Salford. Plans also include a five-star hotel, a new public square and park, restaurants, cafes and 403 apartments. Work is ongoing to regenerate the area known as Middlewood Locks, with the restored Salford terminus of the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal forming the centrepiece of a brand new residential development. As part of the Pathfinder initiative, Salford was identified in 2002 as one of nine areas in specific need of investment for new homes. Between 2003 and 2006 £115M was invested in the Manchester and City of Salford housing markets, £44M of which was invested in central Salford. Rows of terraces in neighbourhoods such as Seedley and Langworthy – once used for the title sequence of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; – are being compulsorily purchased, demolished and replaced by &quot;modern sustainable accommodation&quot;. Other schemes such as the &quot;Charlestown and Lower Kersal New deal for Communities&quot;, have concentrated on renovating existing terraced housing stock by block improvement and alleygating, as well as demolishing unsuitable properties and building new facilities, in consultation with the local community.

Salford now has many tourist attractions, such as Ordsall Hall, the Bridgewater Canal and the Lowry Centre, an award-winning theatre and art gallery complex, consisting of two theatres and three art galleries. The centre is named after the artist L. S. Lowry, who attended Salford School of Art and lived in nearby Pendlebury for 40 years. Many of his paintings of Salford and Manchester mill scenes, populated with small matchstick-like figures, are on display.

A notable regeneration project is MediaCityUK, located at Salford Quays. The development houses BBC departments including CBBC, BBC Sport and Radio 5 Live which moved in 2011 and BBC Breakfast, which moved from London in spring 2012.

In recent years, various large residential schemes have been built in Salford. A notable development, the £700m Middlewood Locks began construction in 2016.

==Governance==
Salford was anciently part of the Manchester parish of the Salford Hundred, an area much larger than the present-day city of Salford, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. A stroke of a Norman baron&#x27;s pen is said to have divorced Manchester and Salford, although it was not Salford that became separated from Manchester, but Manchester, with its humbler line of lords, that was separated from Salford. Salford received its town charter from Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, then Lord of the Manor, in 1230. From then until 1791, when police commissioners were appointed, it was governed by a reeve, a medieval administrator and law enforcement official. It was not recognised as a borough in the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, but was granted borough status in 1844; the new Salford borough was made up of the township of Salford and part of Broughton. The remainder of Broughton, the township of Pendleton, and a small part of Pendlebury were added in 1853.

When the administrative county of Lancashire was created by the Local Government Act 1888, Salford was elevated to become the County Borough of Salford and was, in modern terms, a unitary authority area exempt from the administration of Lancashire County Council. Following a campaign supported by William Joynson-Hicks, Home Secretary and Member of Parliament (MP) for a neighbouring constituency of Manchester, city status was granted to the county borough by letters patent dated 21 April 1926. This was in spite of the opposition of civil servants in the Home Office who dismissed the borough as &quot;merely a scratch collection of 240,000 people cut off from Manchester by the river&quot;. In 1961, a small part of the Municipal Borough of Eccles was added to the city, and in 1966, Salford was twinned with Clermont-Ferrand in France.

In 1974 the City and County Borough of Salford was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, and was replaced by the metropolitan borough of City of Salford, a local government district of the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester, with triple the territory of the former City of Salford, taking in neighbouring Eccles, Swinton and Pendlebury, and Worsley and Irlam. Both Salford and the wider City of Salford are unparished areas.

===Parliamentary representation===
Salford is represented by the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Salford constituency, which was (re)created in 2023 and first used in the 2024 UK general election. Its MP is Rebecca Long-Bailey, who served as a Labour Party MP in Salford since 2015. she sits as an independent MP, after Labour suspended her for voting against a cap on child benefits, contradicting the party whip.

Salford was enfranchised as a parliamentary borough by the Reform Act 1832, returning a single Member of Parliament (MP). It has been subject to numerous constituency changes throughout history. From 1868 it returned two MPs to the House of Commons until the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, when the constituency was split into three single-member divisions: Salford North, Salford South and Salford West. Boundaries changed again under the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1948 when the constituencies were reorganised into Salford East and Salford West. From 1997, Salford lay within a reconstituted Salford parliamentary constituency. From the general election of 2010, Salford (excluding Broughton and Kersal) was part of the new constituency of Salford and Eccles until it was replaced again with the Salford constituency by the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies.

==Geography==

At (53.483°, −2.2931°), and northwest of central London, Salford stands about above sea level, on relatively flat ground to the west of a meander of the River Irwell – the city&#x27;s main topographical feature. In 1904, Salford was recorded as &quot;within a great loop of the River Irwell ... roughly three-quarters of a mile from north to south and one mile from east to west&quot;. Salford is contiguous with Manchester, and has been described &quot;in participation of its trade, and for all other practical purposes, an integral part of it; presents a near resemblance to it in streets and edifices; contains several public buildings and a great public park, which belong fully more to Manchester than to itself&quot;. Greengate, the original centre of Salford, is located at a fording point on the river opposite Manchester Cathedral. In 1969 Nikolaus Pevsner wrote: 
The Irwell, sourced at Cliviger in Lancashire, flows from the north and for a distance forms the statutory boundary between Salford and Manchester. Flooding has historically been a problem and the Irwell has seen much modification along its course in Salford with some bends being removed, channelisation, and the construction of levees and bank reinforcements. Salford has expanded along the river valley to the north and south and on to higher ground on the valley sides at Irlams o&#x27; th&#x27; Height and Higher Broughton. Unconsolidated glacial deposits along the riverbank at Broughton have caused several landslides along the riverbank. The City Engineer&#x27;s Department of the City of Salford recorded one such incident near Great Clowes Street in February 1882, and others in 1886, 1887 and 1888. In 1892 the road was propped with timber supports. The tram service along the road was discontinued in 1925, and the road closed to mechanically propelled vehicles in January 1926. Further slips saw the road closed completely in July 1933, and although no substantial movements have been recorded since 1948 slow subsidence around the Cliff continues to this day.
Salford&#x27;s built environment is made up of a range of building stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford&#x27;s housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the built environment is poor.

Land use in Salford is overwhelmingly urban, with a number of green spaces. The largest is Kersal Dale country park, which covers about . Others include Kersal Moor in Higher Kersal, The Meadow, Peel Park and the adjacent David Lewis Recreation Ground close to the University of Salford, and Albert Park and Clowes Park in Broughton. The territory of Salford is contiguous with other towns on all sides, and as defined by the Office for National Statistics forms the sixth-largest settlement in the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom&#x27;s second-largest conurbation. The M602 motorway enters Salford from Eccles to the west. The A580 &quot;East Lancashire Road&quot; terminates at Salford, entering the area from Pendlebury.

===City centre===
Salford is polycentric (has more than one centre). The main city centre could be considered to be located around Bexley Square near where the town hall and cathedral are located. However, its main shopping centres are Salford Shopping Centre in Pendleton and Salford Quays. As the city has expanded and incorporated Eccles, Walkden, Swinton and Pendlebury, there are now retail and economic centres belonging to these towns.

==Demography==
As of the 2001 UK census, Salford had a population of 72,750. The 2001 population density was 9,151 per mi2 (3,533 per km2), with a 100 to 98.4 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years age, 44.0% were single (never married) and 36.7% married. Salford&#x27;s 32,576 households included 44.1% one-person, 22.0% married couples living together, 7.6% were co-habiting couples, and 13.3% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 37.3% had no academic qualifications, similar to that of 35.5% in all of the City of Salford but significantly higher than 28.9% in all of England. 15.9% of Salford&#x27;s residents aged 16–74 had an educational qualification such as first degree, higher degree, qualified teacher status, qualified medical doctor, qualified dentist, qualified nurse, midwife, health visitor, etc. compared to 20% nationwide.

As a result of 19th-century industrialisation, Salford has had &quot;a special place in the history of the British working class&quot;; together with Manchester it had the world&#x27;s &quot;first fully formed industrial working class&quot;. Salford has not, in general, attracted the same minority ethnic and cosmopolitan communities as in other parts of Greater Manchester, although it did attract significant numbers of Irish in the mid-19th century. Many migrated to Salford because of &quot;the Great Hunger&quot; in Ireland combined with Salford&#x27;s reputation as a hub for employment in its factories and docks. In 1848, Salford Roman Catholic Cathedral opened, reflecting the large Irish-born community in Salford at that time.

In the decades following the Second World War, Salford experienced significant population decline, as residents followed employment opportunities to other locations in Greater Manchester, taking advantage of a greater choice in the type and location of housing.

In 2011, Salford had a population of 103,886, which is about the same size as Rochdale. The population increased from 72,750 in the previous census, mainly due to boundary changes. 


In 2011, 22.7% of the population in the Salford USD (Urban Subdivision) were non-white British, compared with 15.6% for the surrounding borough. The USD had a slightly larger percentage of Asian and black people. Salford has become a lot more ethnically diverse since the previous census, mostly due to boundary changes, but also due to the relocation of many BBC departments from London between 2011 and 2012. This has created many jobs and encouraged migration to the area, which was previously very deprived since the loss of many traditional industries in the 20th century.

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of Salford&#x27;s residents aged 16–74 was 18.0% retail and wholesale, 14.4% property and business services, 12.3% manufacturing, 11.7% health and social work, 8.6% education, 7.3% transport and communications, 6.8% hotels and restaurants, 5.8% construction, 4.4% finance, 4.2% public administration, 0.6% energy and water supply, 0.3% agriculture, 0.1% mining, and 5.7% other. Compared with national figures, Salford had a relatively low percentage of residents working in agriculture. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 4.4% students were with jobs, 9.1% students without jobs, 6.3% looking after home or family, 11.2% permanently sick or disabled, and 4.8% economically inactive for other reasons. The proportion of students economically active in Salford was higher than the City of Salford and England averages (3.0% and 2.6% respectively); the same is true for economically inactive students (5.1% in City of Salford and 4.7% in England). The rest of the figures were roughly inline with national trends.

==Landmarks==
Salford has a series of bridges over the Manchester Ship Canal and onto the River Irwell, including the Grade II listed Blackfriars Bridge, completed in 1820. The settlement is dominated by the several railway viaducts built in the 19th century.

Another Grade II* listed building, Salford Cathedral, is a decorated neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church built between 1844 and 1848. Salford (Old) Town Hall, situated in Bexley Square off Chapel Street, is a Neo-classical brick building dressed in stone, designed by Richard Lane. Closer to Manchester, the tower of the Church of the Sacred Trinity dates from 1635, the main building from 1752. It was restored between 1871 and 1874. Public swimming baths were provided, on Blackfriars Road. Now in commercial use, the two-storey building was constructed in about 1890 from brick, with terracotta dressings and a part-glazed roof.

The University of Salford campus, visible partly from the Crescent, contains a number of interesting buildings including the Royal Art Gallery and the Peel Building.
Kersal Cell is a Grade II* listed 16th-century timber-framed manor house, currently in use as a private residence. One of Salford&#x27;s oldest buildings is the Grade I listed Ordsall Hall, a Tudor mansion and former stately home in nearby Ordsall. It dates back over 750 years, although the oldest surviving parts of the present hall were built in the 15th century.
Salford Lads&#x27; Club is a recreational club established in 1903 and located in Ordsall. It is a listed building and gained international fame in 1986 when the pop band The Smiths posed in front of it for the inside cover of their album &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;. A report by English Heritage said &quot;The building is thought to be the most complete example of this rare form of social provision to survive in England.&quot; In 2007, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported that the club was third in a nationwide hunt to find the most iconic buildings in the country.

==Transport==

One of the earliest transport schemes in Salford was constructed by the Salford to Wigan turnpike trust, by an act of Parliament, the Lancashire Roads Act 1753 (26 Geo. 2. c. 63). Turnpike roads had a huge impact on the nature of business transport around the region. Packhorses were superseded by wagons, and merchants would no longer accompany their caravans to markets and fairs, instead sending agents with samples, and dispatching the goods at a later date. However, road transport was not without its problems, and in 1808 the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal was connected to the River Irwell. In the main a coal-carrying canal, it provided a valuable boost to the economies of Salford and Manchester, with a large number of wharves at its terminus in Salford. Sixteen years later John Greenwood started the first bus operation from Pendleton to Market Street, Manchester.

The Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway – the world&#x27;s first steam driven inter-city passenger railway – opened through Salford on 15 September 1830. The railway was primarily built to provide faster transport of materials and goods between the Port of Liverpool and mills in Manchester and surrounding towns, and stopped along the route at Ordsall Lane railway station. Almost eight years later the Manchester and Bolton Railway was opened, terminating at Salford Central railway station.
By 1801 the population of both Manchester and Salford was about 94,000. By 1861 this had risen to about 460,000, and so in the same year John Greenwood Jr. made an application to Salford Borough Council and to the Pendleton Turnpike Trust, to build a tramway from Pendleton to Albert Bridge in Salford. The system was innovative in that the rails were designed to be &#x27;flush&#x27; with the road surface, with a third central rail to accommodate a perambulator wheel attached to the front axle of the omnibus. Approval was granted and work commenced immediately, with the horse-pulled tramway finished in September 1861. It remained in use for a further eleven years when the condition of the track had deteriorated such that the council ordered it removed. The Tramways Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 78) allowed councils to construct their own tramways, and on 17 May 1877 the &#x27;Manchester and Salford Tramways&#x27; opened for business. The network of lines was largely complete by September 1880, the company changed its name to the Manchester Carriage &amp; Tramways Company, and the system reached its peak in the 1890s. A steam tramway was opened on 12 April 1883 from Bury to Higher Broughton. The vehicles provoked letters of complaints from residents about the associated noise, dirt, and grease, and by 1888 the route was eventually curtailed to Besses o&#x27; th&#x27; Barn.

Electric trams were a common sight in early 20th century Salford, and had from 1901 replaced the earlier horse-drawn vehicles. A network of lines crossed the region, with coordinated services running through Salford, Manchester and the surrounding areas. Many served the new suburban housing and industrial developments built at the time, but in 1947 they were withdrawn in favour of more practical services – buses. The city is served by a complex road infrastructure, with connections from the M602 motorway to several major motorways, and A-roads including the A57 Regent Road and the A6042 Trinity Way. Salford City Council has also created both advisory and mandatory cycle lanes across the city.

Public transport in Salford is now co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), a combined authority area-wide public body with direct operational responsibilities such as supporting (and in some cases running) local bus services, and managing integrated ticketing in Greater Manchester. Salford City Council is responsible for the administration and maintenance of public roads and footpaths throughout the city. The city is served by two railway stations, Salford Central and Salford Crescent. Most train services are provided by Northern Trains, although Salford Crescent is also served by TransPennine Express. Buses run to destinations throughout Salford, the City of Salford, across Greater Manchester and further afield: Pendleton is served by a route to Preston and Blackpool.

The Eccles line of the Manchester Metrolink runs through Salford, with stations at Exchange Quay, Salford Quays, Anchorage, Harbour City, Broadway, Langworthy, Weaste and more recently MediaCityUK. The line was opened in two stages, in 1999 and 2000, as Phase 2 of the system&#x27;s development.

Since 2020, electric scooters have been available for public hire in central Salford, Salford Quays, Ordsall, Pendleton and at the University of Salford. The e-scooter hire service is operated by shared micromobility company Lime.

==Education==
===University and museum===

The University of Salford, a plate glass university, is one of four in Greater Manchester. It has its origins in the former Royal Technical College, which was granted the status of a College of Advanced Technology (CAT), on 2 November 1956. In November 1963 the Robbins Report recommended that the CATs should become technological universities; and on 4 April 1967 a Charter was established creating the University of Salford. The university is undergoing £150M of redevelopment through investment in new facilities, including a £10M law school and a £22M building for health and social care, which were opened in 2006.

The University of Salford has over 19,000 students, and was ranked 81st in the UK by &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. In 2007, the university received nearly 17,000 applications for 3,660 places, and the drop-out rate from the university was 25%. Of the students graduating, 50% gained first class or 2:1 degrees, below the national average of about 55%. The level of student satisfaction in the 2009 survey ranged from 62% to 94%, depending on subject.

Salford developed several civic institutions; in 1806, Chapel Street became the first street in the world to be lit by gas (supplied by Phillips and Lee&#x27;s cotton mill). Salford Museum and Art Gallery opened in November 1850, under the terms of the Museums Act 1845, as the Royal Museum and Public Library. It was built on the site of Lark Hill estate and Mansion, which was purchased by public subscription. The estate around the building was named Peel Park after Robert Peel who contributed to the subscription fund. The library was said to be the first unconditionally free public library in the country, preceding the Public Libraries Act 1850.

===Schools and colleges===
Despite the rapid progress made during the Industrial Revolution, by 1851 education in Salford was judged &quot;inadequate to the wants of the population&quot;, and for those children who did get schooling &quot;order and cleanliness were little regarded ... [they] were for the most part crowded in close and dirty rooms&quot;.

Salford has thirty-two primary schools, and five secondary schools. Until recently there were three main 6th form and FE colleges: Pendleton College, Eccles College and Salford College. They merged to create Salford City College in January 2009.

==Religion==

From the formation of the Hundred of Salford, the entire area was within the Diocese of Lichfield. This diocese was divided in 1541, upon the creation of the See of Chester.

Early worship took place at the parish church of Manchester, however a small chantry chapel existed in 1368 on the only bridge linking the two settlements. In the 16th century, it was converted into a dungeon, and was later demolished in 1779. In 1634–35, Humphrey Booth, a wealthy local merchant, opened a chapel of ease, which a year later was consecrated as the Chapel of Sacred Trinity (the parish of Sacred Trinity was created in 1650). John Wesley preached in the building, before his break with the Anglican Church. However, upon his return in 1747, he preached in the open, at Salford Cross. The chapel was rebuilt in about 1752–53, although the tower probably belonged to the original building. It was restored in 1871–74 by the architect J. P. Holden and a chapel was added to the south-east in 1934. It is now a Grade II* listed building.

Salford Cathedral is one of the largest Catholic cathedrals in Northern England. It was built between 1844 and 1848, and was listed as a Grade II* building in 1980. It is at the centre of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford, which was founded in 1850 as one of the first post-Reformation Catholic dioceses in Britain. Its current boundaries encompass Manchester and a large part of North West England. The Bishop of Salford&#x27;s official residence is at Wardley Hall.
 Salford Deanery is in the Salford Archdeaconry of the Church of England. The sixteen churches in the deanery include the Parish Church of Saint Paul the Apostle in Paddington, St. Thomas&#x27; in Pendleton, St Philip with St Stephen near the town hall and St Clement&#x27;s in Ordsall.

The Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, Manchester was founded in 1861, in Broughton. It was established by the local Greek immigrant community, who had arrived in the area soon after the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century. It replaced an earlier place of worship on Cheetham Hill Road, and an earlier chapel on Wellington Street. It is the oldest purpose-built Orthodox church in the country.

==Sports==

Salford has a notable history in sports, which includes hosting some of the events in the 2002 Commonwealth Games: rugby league, speedway, and horse racing. Salford had a venue for horse racing since the 17th century; the earliest record of racing at Kersal Moor dates from 1687.

Salford Red Devils is the city&#x27;s rugby league club and has been based in Salford since 1873. They participate in the Super League. Salford now play all home games at the AJ Bell Stadium. Junior rugby league is also played within Salford&#x27;s boundaries, with Langworthy Reds, Folly Lane and Salford City Roosters amongst other clubs providing playing personnel to the senior club.

The Premiership side Sale Sharks play their home games at the AJ Bell Stadium since the start of the 2012–13 season

Salford Quays has been used as a major international triathlon site, but a 2009 aquathlon was cancelled because of a lack of competitors.

During the early part of the 20th century speedway was staged at Albion Stadium.

Prior to Salford City&#x27;s promotion to the Football League in 2019, Salford was one of the largest settlements in the UK without a league football team;. In the formative years of the sport the region&#x27;s football heartland was in east Manchester, with few teams to the west. Salford City are Salford&#x27;s only representatives in the Football League, playing in League Two, the fourth tier of English football, as of the 2024-25 season.

==Culture==

Harold Brighouse&#x27;s play &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot; takes place in the Salford of 1880, and the 1954 film version was shot in the town. Walter Greenwood&#x27;s 1933 novel &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; was set in a fictional area known as Hanky Park, said in the novel to be near Salford, but in reality based on Salford itself. A more modern fictional setting influenced by the area is &quot;Coronation Street&quot;&#x27;s Weatherfield. The Salford of the 1970s was the setting for the BAFTA award winning &quot;East is East&quot;. Salford was featured in the second series of the Channel 4 programme &quot;The Secret Millionaire&quot;, screened in 2007. Salford is also home to the theatre venue Studio Salford.

The folk song &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot;, written by native Ewan MacColl, is the origin of Salford&#x27;s nickname. Local band Doves released a song on their 2005 album &quot;Some Cities&quot; called &quot;Shadows of Salford&quot;. One of the most famous photographs of band The Smiths shows them standing outside the Salford Lads Club, and was featured in the artwork for their album &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;. In 2010, The Cold One Hundred, an English indie rock band formed in Salford. The videos for the Timbaland song &quot;The Way I Are&quot;, and the Justin Timberlake song &quot;Lovestoned&quot; were filmed in Salford.

==Public services==
Under the requirements of the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, the County Borough of Salford was obliged to appoint a Watch Committee to establish a police force and appoint a chief constable. On 1 June 1968 the Manchester and Salford city constabularies formed the Manchester and Salford Police. Since 1974, Home Office policing in Salford has been provided by the Greater Manchester Police. The force&#x27;s &quot;(F) Division&quot; has its headquarters for policing the City of Salford at Swinton, with further police stations in Little Hulton, Higher Broughton and Salford. The Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, whose headquarters are on Bolton Road in nearby Pendlebury.

Salford Royal Hospital dated back to 1830 and was extended in 1911. It was closed and converted into flats. The modern Salford Royal, at Hope, near the boundary with Eccles, was opened in 1882 as the Salford Union Infirmary. Later renamed Hope Hospital and then again as Salford Royal, it is a large NHS hospital administrated by Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust. In a 2006–07 review of all 394 NHS Trusts in England by the Healthcare Commission, Salford Royal was one of 19 to be rated excellent in its quality of services and its use of resources. The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by several small clinics and surgeries.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. Salford&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is United Utilities; there are no power stations in the city. United Utilities also manages Salford&#x27;s drinking and waste water.

<doc id="182233" wikidata="Q201272" url="?curid=182233" title="Paros">
<text>Paros (; ; ) is a Greek island in the central Aegean Sea. Part of the Cyclades island group, it lies to the west of Naxos, from which it is separated by a channel about wide. It lies approximately south-east of Piraeus. The Municipality of Paros includes numerous uninhabited offshore islets totaling of land. Its nearest neighbor is the municipality of Antiparos, which lies to its southwest. In ancient Greece, the city-state of Paros was located on the island.

Historically, Paros was known for its fine white marble, which gave rise to the term &quot;Parian&quot; to describe marble or china of similar qualities. Today, abandoned marble quarries and mines (with some still being in use) can be found on the island, but Paros is primarily known as a popular tourist spot.

==Geography==
Paros&#x27; geographic coordinates are 37° N. latitude, and 25° 10&#x27; E. longitude. The area is . Its greatest length from N.E. to S.W. is , and its greatest breadth . The island is of a round, plump-pear shape, formed by a single mountain () sloping evenly down on all sides to a maritime plain, which is broadest on the north-east and south-west sides. The island is composed of marble, though gneiss and mica-schist are to be found in a few places. To the west of Paros lies its smaller sister island Antiparos. At its narrowest, the channel between the two islands is less than wide. A car-carrying shuttle-ferry operates all day (to and from Pounda, south of Parikia). In addition a dozen smaller islets surround Paros.

Paros has numerous beaches including Golden Beach (Chrissí Aktí) near Drios on the east coast, at Pounda, Logaras, Piso Livadi, Naousa Bay, Parikia and Agia Irini. The constant strong wind in the strait between Paros and Naxos makes it a favoured windsurfing location.

==History==

===Antiquity===
The story that Paros of Parrhasia colonized the island with Arcadians is an etymological fiction of the type that abounds in Greek legends. Ancient names of the island are said to have been Plateia (or Pactia), Demetrias, Strongyle (meaning round, due to the round shape of the island), Hyria, Hyleessa, Minoa and Cabarnis.

The island later received from Athens a colony of Ionians under whom it attained a high degree of prosperity. It sent out colonies to Thasos and Parium on the Hellespont. In the former colony, which was planned in the 15th or 18th Olympiad, the poet Archilochus, a native of Paros, is said to have taken part. As late as 385 BC the Parians, in conjunction with Dionysius of Syracuse, founded a colony on the Illyrian island of Pharos (Hvar).

Shortly before the Persian War, Paros seems to have been a dependency of Naxos. In the first Greco-Persian War (490 BC), Paros sided with the Persians and sent a trireme to Marathon to support them. In retaliation, the capital was besieged by an Athenian fleet under Miltiades, who demanded a fine of 100 talents. But the town offered a vigorous resistance, and the Athenians were obliged to sail away after a siege of 26 days, during which they had wasted the island. It was at a temple of Demeter Thesmophoros in Paros that Miltiades received the wound from which he died. By means of an inscription, Ludwig Ross was able to identify the site of the temple; it lies, as Herodotus suggests, on a low hill beyond the boundary of the town.

Paros also sided with shahanshah Xerxes I of Persia against Greece in the second Greco-Persian War (480–479 BC), but, after the battle of Artemisium, the Parian contingent remained inactive at Kythnos as they watched the progression of events. For their support of the Persians, the islanders were later punished by the Athenian war leader Themistocles, who exacted a heavy fine.

Under the Delian League, the Athenian-dominated naval confederacy (477–404 BC), Paros paid the highest tribute of the island members: 30 &quot;talents&quot; annually, according to the estimate of Olympiodorus (429 BC). This implies that Paros was one of the wealthiest islands in the Aegean. Little is known about the constitution of Paros, but inscriptions seem to show that it was modeled on the Athenian democracy, with a &quot;boule&quot; (senate) at the head of affairs. In 410 BC, Athenian general Theramenes discovered that Paros was governed by an oligarchy; he deposed the oligarchy and restored the democracy. Paros was included in the second Athenian confederacy (the Second Athenian League 378–355 BC). In , along with Chios, it severed its connection with Athens.

From the inscription of Adule, it is understood that the Cyclades, which are presumed to include Paros, were subjected to the Ptolemies, the Hellenistic dynasty (305–30 BC) that ruled Egypt. Paros then became part of the Roman Empire and later of the Byzantine Empire, its Greek-speaking successor state.

===Crusades===

In 1204, the soldiers of the Fourth Crusade seized Constantinople and overthrew the Byzantine Empire. Although a residual Byzantine state known as the Empire of Nicaea survived the Crusader onslaught and eventually recovered Constantinople (1261), many of the original Byzantine territories, including Paros, were lost permanently to the crusading powers. Paros became subject to the Duchy of the Archipelago, a fiefdom made up of various Aegean islands ruled by a Venetian duke as nominal vassal of a succession of crusader states. In practice, however, the duchy was always a client state of the Republic of Venice.

===Ottoman era and independence===

In 1537, Paros was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under the Ottoman Empire until the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829). The Ottoman conquest of Paros resulted in atrocities committed against the public: as happened to the population in other islands during the Ottoman conquest of the Aegean islands, old men were killed; young men were made galley slaves; little boys were made janissaries; and the women where ordered to dance on the shore so that the conquerors could choose the most attractive for the lieutentants, enslaving around 6000 of the inhabitants of Paros for slavery in the Ottoman Empire. 

During the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) in 1770–1775 Naoussa Bay was the home base for the Russian Archipelago Squadron of Count Alexey Orlov. Under the Treaty of Constantinople (1832), Paros became part of the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, the first time the Parians had been ruled by fellow Greeks for over six centuries. At this time, Paros became the home of a heroine of the nationalist movement, Manto Mavrogenous, who had both financed and fought in the war for independence. Her house, near Ekatontapiliani church, is today a historical monument.

=== WWII and Nazi Occupation ===
During the WWII Axis occupation of Greece, Paros was originally occupied by the Italians until 1943. The Nazis then took over the Island in 1944 and imposed brutal rule from the beginning. 

In 1944, during the German occupation of Paros, the island&#x27;s strategic importance led to the forced construction of an airfield located near the village of Marpissa. The project amassed over 400 forced Greek workers at one point. Local resistance, aided by the Allies, sought to sabotage the project, with Nikolas Stellas, a 23-year-old partisan, emerging as a key figure. Captured by the Germans, Stellas refused to provide any names or information and was therefore publicly hanged, becoming a symbol of resistance. In retaliation, 125 Parians were condemned to execution. However, Major Georg Graf von Merenberg, the German commander, was persuaded by Abbot Philotheos Zervakos to spare them, influenced by Stellas&#x27; sacrifice and the abbot&#x27;s appeal to his humanity.

British commandos and local partisans conducted a successful operation that led to the attack on German forces stationed there. The operation included the sabotage of German communication lines and the abduction of a key German officer. This resistance effort was part of a broader Allied strategy in the Aegean during World War II, contributing to the disruption of German military operations in the region. The airfield constructed by the Germans in Marpissa was later bombed by the British. There are no remains of the airfield today. 

=== 21st century ===
On 26 September 2000 the ferry MS Express Samina collided with the Portes islets off the bay of Parikia, killing 82 of those on board.

Starting in the summer of 2023, the island saw protests from locals on many beaches due to government failure to stop beach-side businesses from placing more umbrellas than permitted. The protests saw some success, with the Greek government toughening inspections and implementing fines for businesses who do not abide by the rules. 

==Parikia==
The capital, Parikia (Greek: παροικία), situated on a bay on the north-west side of the island, occupies the site of the ancient capital Paros. Parikía harbour is a major hub for Aegean islands ferries and catamarans, with several sailings each day for Piraeus, the port of Athens, Heraklion, the capital of Crete, and other islands such as Naxos, Ios, Mykonos, and Santorini.


In Parikia town, houses are built and decorated in the traditional Cycladic style, with flat roofs, whitewash walls and blue-painted doors and window frames and shutters. Shadowed by luxuriant vines, and surrounded by gardens of oranges and pomegranates, the houses give the town a picturesque aspect. Above the central stretch of the seafront road, are the remains of a medieval castle, built almost entirely of the marble remains of an ancient temple dedicated to Apollo. Similar traces of antiquity, in the shape of bas-reliefs, inscriptions, columns, and so on, are numerous. On a hillside in the southern outskirts of Parikia on the left of the Parikia – Alyki road are the remains of a temple dedicated to Asclepius. In addition, close to the modern harbour, the remains of an ancient cemetery are visible, having been discovered recently during non-archaeological excavations.

Back from the port, around 400 m left of Parikia&#x27;s main square, is the town&#x27;s principal church, the Panagia Ekatontapiliani, literally meaning &quot;church of the hundred doors&quot;. Its oldest features almost certainly predate the adoption of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire in 391. It is said to have been founded by the mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (ruled 306–337), Saint Helen, during her pilgrimage to the Holy Land. There are two adjoining chapels, one of very early form, and also a baptistery with a cruciform font.

The Archaeological Museum of Paros is located in Parikia town,a small but interesting museum housing some of the many finds from sites in Paros. The best pieces, however, are in the Athens National Archaeological Museum. The Paros museum contains a fragment of the Parian Chronicle, a remarkable chronology of ancient Greece. Inscribed in marble, its entries give time elapsed between key events from the most distant past (1500 BC) down to 264 BC.

==Other settlements==


On the north side of the island is the bay of Naoussa (Naussa, formerly Agoussa or Ausa), which provides a natural spacious harbor for boat traffic. In ancient times it was closed by a chain or boom. In modern times it is experiencing great touristic development.

Another popular harbor is that of Drios on the south-east side, where the Turkish fleet used to anchor on its annual voyage through the Aegean during the period of Ottoman rule over Paros (1537–1832).

The three villages of Prodromos (formerly Dragoulas), Marmara, and Marpissa (formerly Tsipidos), situated on an open plain on the eastern side of the island, and rich in remains of antiquity, probably occupy the site of an ancient town. They are known together as the &quot;villages of Kephalos&quot; after the steep and lofty hill of Kephalos. On this hilltop stands the monastery of &quot;Agios Antonios&quot; (St. Anthony). Around it are the ruins of a medieval castle which belonged in the late Middle Ages to the Venetian noble family of the Venieri which fought a battle against the Turkish admiral Barbarossa in 1537.

Another settlement on the island Paros is Lefkes (Λεύκες). Lefkes is an inland mountain village away from Parikia. In the late 19th century, Lefkes was the center of the municipality of Iria which belonged to the Province of Naxos until 1912. The name of the municipality Iria was one of the ancient names of Paros. Lefkes was the capital of the municipality Iria which included the villages Angyria or Ageria, Aliki, Aneratzia, Vounia, Kamari, Campos, Langada, Maltes, and Marathi. Iria became Lefkes Community following the law enforcement DNZ/1912 &quot;On Municipalities&quot;. At that time, the village managed to achieve great economic development. In the 1970s many residents moved to Athens due to urbanization. However, the last few years, tourism presented to be a new source of income for the locals that led to the reconstruction of homes and landscaping to make it appealing as a tourist destination. Lefkes became part of the municipality of Paros in the Kapodistrias local government reform. In the latest census (2011) the population numbered 545 inhabitants.

==Marble quarries==

Parian marble, which is white and translucent, with a coarse grain and a very beautiful texture, was the chief source of wealth for the island. The celebrated marble quarries lie on the northern side of the mountain anciently known as Marathi (afterwards Capresso), a little below a former convent of St Mina. The marble, which was exported from the 6th century BC onwards, was used by Praxiteles and other ancient Greek sculptors. It was obtained by means of subterranean quarries driven horizontally or at a descending angle into the rock. The marble thus quarried by lamplight was given the name of Lychnites, Lychneus (from &quot;lychnos&quot;, a lamp), or Lygdos. Several of these tunnels are still to be seen. At the entrance to one of them is a bas-relief dedicated to Pan and the nymphs. Several attempts to work the marble have been made in modern times, but it has not been exported in any great quantities. The major part of the remaining white marble is now state-owned and, like its Pentelic counterpart, is only used for archaeological restorations.

In December 1883 these quarries were visited by Theodore and Mabel Bent during their tour of the Cyclades.

<text>Sex differences in medicine include sex-specific diseases or conditions which occur only in people of one sex due to underlying biological factors (for example, prostate cancer in males or uterine cancer in females); sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more common to one sex (for example, breast cancer and systemic lupus erythematosus which occur predominantly in females); and diseases which occur at similar rates in males and females but manifest differently according to sex (for example, peripheral artery disease).

Sex differences should not be confused with gender differences. The US National Academy of Medicine recognizes sex differences as biological at the chromosomal and anatomical levels, whereas gender differences are based on self-representation and other factors including biology, environment and experience.
That said, both biological and behavioural differences influence human health, and may do so differentially. Such factors can be inter-related and difficult to separate. Evidence-based approaches to sex and gender medicine try to examine the effects of both sex and gender as factors when dealing with medical conditions that may affect populations differently.

, over 10,000 articles had been published addressing sex and gender differences in clinical medicine and related literature. Sex and gender affect cardiovascular, 
pulmonary 
and autoimmune systems, 
gastroenterology,
hepatology, 
nephrology, 
endocrinology, 
haematology,
neurology,
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.

Sexually transmitted infections, which have a significant probability of transmission through sexual contact, can be contracted by either sex. Their occurrence may reflect economic and social as well as biological factors, leading to sex differences in the transmission, prevalence, and disease burden of STIs.

Historically, medical research has primarily been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes, and healthcare providers have traditionally assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients. More recently, medical research has started to understand the importance of taking sex into account as evidence increases that the symptoms and responses to medical treatment may be very different between sexes.

==Background==

Females and males exhibit many differences in terms of risk of developing disease, receiving an accurate diagnosis, and responding to treatments. A patient&#x27;s sex has been increasingly recognized as one of the most important modulators of clinical decision making. Sex differences have been found across a broad range of disease areas, including many diseases which are sex-specific. The sex chromosome complement and sex hormone environment are known to be the primary constitutive difference between females and males. The imbalance of gene expression between the X and Y chromosomes is present within virtually all cells in the human body. Sex hormones are crucial in body development and function and also thought to contribute to sex differences in some diseases. It is suspected that many differences between the sexes are also influenced by social, environmental, and psychological factors which are difficult to tease apart from biological ones.

==Causes==
Sex-related illnesses have various causes:
* Genetic sex differences start at conception depending on whether an ovum fuses with a sperm cell carrying an X or a Y chromosome. This leads to sex-based differences at the molecular level for all male and female cells.
* In males, the X chromosome carries only maternal imprints, while in females X chromosomes are present with both maternal and paternal imprints. In female cells, random processes of X-inactivation &quot;turn off&quot; the extra X chromosome. As a result, females, but not males, are mosaics. Female cells may express higher levels of some genes.
* Sex differences at the chromosome and molecular level exist in all human cells, and persist life-long, independent of sex hormones in the body.
* Sex-linked genetic conditions that differ in males and females may reflect the effects of genetic damage on an X chromosome. In some cases, the presence of an &quot;extra&quot; X chromosome in female cells may lessen the impact of such damage. In severe cases, males may die during development and females may survive but display a sex-linked illness.
* The reproductive system develops differently for each sex. Sex-specific parts of the male and female reproductive systems affect the rest of the body and also can be affected differently by diseases.
* Socially constructed norms relate to gender roles, relationships, positional power, and a wide variety of behaviours. Norms affect people differentially depending on their sex and gender.
* Different levels of prevention, reporting, diagnosis, and treatment have been observed based on sex and gender.

==Examples of sex-related illnesses and disorders in humans==
===Females===
Examples of sex-related illnesses and disorders in human females:

* 99% of breast cancer occurs in women.
* Ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and other diseases affect the female reproductive system.
* Females are more likely to experience severe outcomes from viral respiratory tract infections during their reproductive years, compared to males of the same age. In response to treatment, females may develop greater immune responses but may also experience more adverse reactions than males.
* Approximately four times more women have osteoporosis than men.
* Autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome and scleroderma, are more prevalent in women. Roughly 70% of those living with autoimmune diseases are female. See Sex differences in autoimmunity.
* While estimates vary widely, eating disorders are estimated to affect as high as 13% of women in some age groups and 3% of men in Western cultures, with anorexia nervosa affecting 10 women for each man and bulimia nervosa affecting 8 women for each man.
* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease has a higher incidence in females compared to males. There are also phenotypic differences, with females displaying more cognitive deficits. Females are also more likely to have neurofibrillary tangles present on autopsy.
* Huntington&#x27;s disease affects females and males differently. Females have faster disease progression, and display symptoms with fewer trinucleotide repeats. 
* About two times more women than men have unipolar clinical depression (although bipolar disorder appears to affect both sexes equally).
* About three times more women than men are diagnosed with borderline or histrionic personality disorder.
*Conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and idiopathic hypersomnia, which have unclear causes, are more common in women, with sex ratios ranging from 2:1 in IBS, fibromyalgia, and idiopathic hypersomnia to 4:1 in CFS, and 5:1 in POTS.
*Most people with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) (75%) are female.
*Ataxic cerebral palsy is more common in women and girls.
*Turner Syndrome only occurs in females.

===Males===
Examples of sex-related illnesses and disorders in male humans:

* Prostate cancer, testicular cancer and other diseases of the male reproductive system occur in males.
* Diseases of X-linked recessive inheritance, such as colour blindness, occur more frequently in males, and haemophilia A and B occur almost exclusively in males.
* The presence of a single X chromosome in males (rather than two in females) may explain why males are more susceptible to genetic diseases linked to the X chromosome, including hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Hunter syndrome.
* Certain neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson&#x27;s disease (2:1 ratio) and Lewy body dementia (4:1 ratio)) are more prevalent in males. Parkinson&#x27;s also displays phenotypic differences: males are more likely to present with sleep disturbances and deficits in verbal fluency and facial expression.
* Abdominal aortic aneurysms are six times more common in males, and thus some countries have introduced screening for males at risk of developing the condition.
* Autism is approximately four times more prevalent in males than females. Males also have distinct autism phenotypes compared to females, including a higher prevalence of restrictive and repetitive behaviors.
*Males have increased risk of dyskinetic cerebral palsy and spastic diplegia, as well as lower limb deformities.
*Schizophrenia is about 1.4 times as common in males, and on average starts two years earlier and has more severe symptoms.
* More than two times more males than females are affected by antisocial personality disorder and substance use disorder.
*Several cancers, including stomach cancer (2:1), oesophageal cancer (3:1), liver cancer (2:1 to 4:1) and oral cancer (2:1 to 3:1), which have mostly lifestyle-based risk factors, are more common in males.
* Males are more likely to experience severe outcomes from viral respiratory tract infections than females, at younger and older ages.
* Tuberculosis is more common in males.
* In cases of preterm birth, being male is associated with higher mortality and morbidity in terms of respiratory distress, cardiovascular disorders (specifically hypotension), neurodevelopmental disorders, and immune disorders.
* Although both males and females can have eating disorders, males are less likely to be diagnosed and receive treatment.
* Klinefelter syndrome (karyotype XXY) is the most common sex chromosome aneuploidy (occurring in ~152/100,000 births, only in males). It is often subclinical, but can cause infertility, tall stature, gynecomastia (enlargement of the breast tissue), limited facial and body hair, and small firm testicles.

==Reasons for sex differences in incidence and prevalence==
===Hypertension===
Hypertension is a worldwide disease affecting the sexes. Women are less frequently affected by high blood pressure . Since blood pressure rises in women after menopause, this suggests that the cause of the sex-specific differences lies not only in possible external factors, such as lifestyle, but also in the sex hormones . It is likely due to sex hormones not external factors. One possible mechanism is the influence of the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS).

Angiotensinogen (liver) is converted into angiotensin I (Ang I) by renin (kidney). Ang I is converted to angiotensin II (Ang II) by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This binds to the Ang II type I receptor (A2T1), which causes vasoconstriction and water and sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, and in turn increases blood pressure.

Less well known is that Ang II can also bind to Ang II type II receptor (A2T2) or be converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE II) into angiotensin III (Ang III), which binds to MAS receptors. Both A2T2 and MAS receptors trigger vasodilation.
Animal experiments have shown that female ovariectomised mice treated chronically with testosterone have increased blood pressure (mean arterial pressure ~180mmHg) compared to female mice from the control group (~155mmHg). This difference was reduced by ACE inhibition (enalapril (250 mg/L)) in both groups to a similar level ( ~115mmHg). It can therefore be assumed that male androgens have an increasing influence (up to 25mmHg in middle blood pressure) on angiotensinogen.

=== Autoimmune diseases (Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome) ===
In autoimmune diseases, like Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome (SS), the body produces hyperreactive autoantibodies against the salivary and lacrimal gland tissue. This results in symptoms like dry mouth and dry eyes.

The gender distribution in Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome is heavily skewed towards women, with a ratio of 16:1 in the UK. Various reasons have been suggested, but the evidence is not strong. One common reason is the hormonal differences between women and men. In women, estrogen dominates, as does the hormone progesterone during pregnancy. Androgens (e.g. testosterone) are only present in small quantities. In men, testosterone, an androgen, dominates, and estrogen is only present to a small extent. Estrogen stimulates the immune system more than androgens. Accordingly, it stands to reason that an autoimmune reaction, which is based on a hyperreactive immune sensitivity to autoantigens, can manifest itself much more easily in women.

In Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, B cells and interferons are of particular importance. Generally, hormone receptors are expressed on immune cells (e.g., B cells), such as the estrogen receptor (ER-alpha/ß) or the androgen receptor. These receptors are steroid hormone receptors, i.e., they influence gene expression in the nucleus of the immune cells.

Pregnancy, including hormonal changes, appears to increase the risk of developing SS and also exacerbate the course of the disease if it is already present. During pregnancy, more hormones than just estrogen are secreted that also have an immune system-stimulating effect, such as prolactin. So, an overstimulated immune system seems to be the result.

On the other hand, estrogen protects glandular cells and prevents them from cell death. Menopause causes a decreased level of hormones like estrogen and thus reduces the protective effect on glandular cell health. Increased apoptosis (cell death) and inflammatory effects on damaged and aged cells are the result. As a result, there is an increased level of autoantibodies against the glandular cells. Estrogen is important, but only in the right amount. The study showed that the prevalence of women developing SS after menopause is quite higher than before menopause. This leads to the assumption that the protective effect of estrogen on glandular tissue is more important than the stimulation effect on B cells for the development of SS.

Another study investigated the hormonal influence on the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including SS. Female mice had their ovaries removed to investigate the effect of missing estrogen on the pathogenesis of SS. In this study, low estrogen levels promoted apoptosis and the formation of apoptotic bodies and microparticles containing membrane antigens. These are recognized as pathogens via TLR (toll-like receptors) of the dendritic and B cells, which then secrete increased levels of INF alpha/ß and cytokines. These cytokines stimulate other immune cells (e.g., DC, T-cells), which can lead to autoreactivity and thus to an autoimmune reaction.

In men, the preliminary stage of testosterone, DHT (dihydrotestosterone), is synthesized from testosterone in one simple step. DHT has an anti-apoptotic effect on the glandular tissue. In women, DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) takes over this task. Synthesizing this product in women is much more complex and involves several steps that are difficult to ensure when estrogen levels are low (menopause, etc.). This might be another reason for increased apoptosis and the pathogenesis of SS in women compared to men.

Another key player in the pathogenesis of SS is INF1. It is stimulated by estrogen receptor interaction. INF1 ensures a higher level of autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines. A study has shown that interferon type I and type II are more pronounced in women than in men. That might be a reason for the increased level of autoantibodies and prevalence of SS in women.

Androgens generally have stimulating effects on the production of the lipid layer in the tear film and oral mucosa. Androgens increase the level of integrins alpha1 and 2, which promote the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into acinar cells. In the absence of androgens, this differentiation and regulation are defective. In SS, the conversion of testosterone to DHT (in men) or DHEA (in women) in the lacrimal glands is defective. The enzymes are not functional. This means that the lipid layer, which is important for maintaining moisture in the mouth and on the eyes and providing protection against pathogens, is missing. This could be a leading reason for symptoms like dry mouth and dry eyes.

Another study investigated the effects of gene expression of the sex chromosomes. Normally, one X chromosome is inhibited in women (Barr body). However, not completely. Some of the genes of the inhibited X chromosome are still (single or double) expressed, including genes relevant to the immune system. This is supposed to ensure better immunity, among other things, but also results in a higher risk of autoimmunity.

The study has shown that the prevalence of SS in triple-X individuals is 2.9 times higher than in healthy women and 41 times higher than in healthy men, despite physiological hormone levels. This suggests an involvement of the double gene expression of the 2nd X chromosome in the pathogenesis of SS, which could also affect XX genotype women. An explanation how the double gene expression, which can also be normal, can be manifesting investigated another study. 

Another study investigated the influence of a long non coding RNA protein, called XIST, which is a leading factor of the double X chromosome expression. XIST is only present in women where it is inactivating genes of the second “restoring” X chromosome. Dysfuncitonal XIST proteins seem to be a leading cause of higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases of women, so as in SS.

Furthermore, intestinal microbiome differences, elevated levels of certain miRNAs, and microchimerism during pregnancy are discussed and investigated as possible risk factors in the pathogenesis of SS.

<doc id="182235" wikidata="Q5260359" url="?curid=182235" title="Department of Internal Affairs">
<text>The Department of Internal Affairs (DIA; ) is the public service department of New Zealand charged with issuing passports; administering applications for citizenship and lottery grants; enforcing censorship and gambling laws; registering births, deaths, marriages and civil unions; supplying support services to ministers; and advising the government on a range of relevant policies and issues.

Other services provided by the department include a translation service, publication of the &quot;New Zealand Gazette&quot; (the official government newspaper), a flag hire service, management of VIP visits to New Zealand, running the Lake Taupō harbourmaster&#x27;s office (under a special agreement with the local iwi) and the administration of offshore islands.

==History==
===19th century===
The Department of Internal Affairs traces its roots back to the Colonial Secretary&#x27;s Office, which from the time New Zealand became a British colony, in 1840, was responsible for almost all central government duties. The department was the first government department to be established in New Zealand, and it became the home for a diverse range of government functions providing services to New Zealanders and advice to Ministers of the Crown. A former Minister of Internal Affairs, Michael Bassett, wrote a history of the department, &quot;The Mother of All Departments&quot;, the title of which reflects this status. The department&#x27;s role has changed over time as new departments and ministries have been formed.

The Colonial Secretary was the chief aide of the governor of New Zealand. Until 1848 his office dealt with all correspondence between the governor and his employees, and between officials and the public. Other early functions included inspecting sheep, running prisons, supervising government printing, licensing auctioneers, registering births, deaths and marriages, collecting statistics, and responsibility for gambling, fire brigades, constitutional matters (including running elections) and citizenship. Some of these functions are still duties of the modern department, which gained its present name in 1907, but other functions eventually grew into standalone government agencies. As the department&#x27;s functions have changed over time, there has become a growing acknowledgement that it carries responsibility for all government functions which are not substantial enough to justify a standalone organisation or do not fit well into any other existing departments.

From 1853 the Colonial Secretary&#x27;s Office coordinated the relationship between central government and provincial government and, when the provinces were abolished in 1876, took on responsibility for the new system of local government.

===20th century===
Over the twentieth century the department&#x27;s functions would include cultural affairs, civil defence, a translation service, conservation, tourism, sport and recreation, support for ethnic communities, and support services for government ministers. Several new government departments have been formed by establishing new agencies around former Internal Affairs services. The electoral office moved to the Department of Justice in 1950 before becoming an independent Electoral Commission in 2010. The Ministry of Industries and Commerce took over the statistics function in 1931; an independent Department of Statistics was created in 1957. The Department of Conservation was established in 1987 by merging the department&#x27;s wildlife service with other smaller entities.

The National Library of New Zealand and Archives New Zealand were separated from the department in the late 1990s but merged back in 2011. A standalone Ministry of Cultural Affairs (now the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, which in the present day also has responsibility for the sport and recreation portfolio) was established in 1991. The department briefly held responsibility for tourism from 1998 until 2000, when this was combined with other former Ministry of Commerce functions in the new Ministry of Economic Development, now the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

===21st century===
The National Emergency Management Agency, which had been a business unit within the department since before World War II, was transferred to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in 2009. The Office of Ethnic Communities, originally a single part-time position within the department, became the new Ministry for Ethnic Communities in 2021.

The department has also gained responsibilities that previously belonged to other agencies. In 2009 the department took responsibility for government technology services from the State Services Commission. The Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector was transferred to the department from the Ministry of Social Development in 2011. In 2021, the department gained the legal ability to process requests from people wishing to change their sex on their birth certificate, including to a non-binary marker, rather than them needing to go through the court system.

In mid-April 2024, the department experienced a backlog in processing New Zealand passport applications due to the installation of computer system upgrades in March 2024 and increased seasonal demand. Standard passport processing took eight weeks while urgent passport processing took three days. The number of passports processed dropped from 38,000 in February 2024 to half that number in March 2024. On 14 May 2024, the department apologised for delays in wait times for processing passport applications.

<doc id="182236" wikidata="Q175741" url="?curid=182236" title="Andros">
<text>Andros (, ) is the northernmost island of the Greek Cyclades archipelago, about southeast of Euboea, and about north of Tinos. It is nearly long, and its greatest breadth is . It is for the most part mountainous, with many fruitful and well-watered valleys. The municipality, which includes the island Andros and several small, uninhabited islands, has an area of . The largest towns are Andros (town), Gavrio, Batsi, and Ormos Korthiou.

Palaeopolis, the ancient capital, was built into a steep hillside, and the breakwater of its harbor can still be seen underwater. At the village of Apoikia, there is the notable spring of Sariza, where the water flows from a sculpted stone lion&#x27;s head. Andros also offers hiking options with many new paths being added each year.

== Strofilas ==
During the Final Neolithic, Andros had a fortified village on its west coast, which archaeologists have named , after the plateau on which it was built. Final Neolithic in the Cycladic area is now dated around 4500–4000 BC. Strofilas was related to the &quot;Attica-Kephala&quot; culture, coinciding with the beginning of the Cycladic culture of the Bronze Age.

Strofilas is the largest organized settlement of the Neolithic Age of the Aegean in Cyclades islands. It was rather densely built, and stretches over 30 acres. The excavations were started in 1997 by a team of Greek archeologists headed by Christina Televantou.

The settlement was an important maritime centre and one of the earliest examples of fortification in Greece. Its fortifications feature a gate and bastions.

Strofilas is also notable for rock carvings on its walls, which include animals such as jackals, goats, deer, fish and dolphins, as well as a depiction of a flotilla of ships.

About 1km to the southeast along the coastline, also can be found the site of , another ancient settlement of a later Geometric period. The settlement dates back to the 10th-8th centuries BC. An impregnable wall, about 110 meters long, was constructed around it.

==History==
===Antiquity===
In ancient times, the island contained an Ionian population, perhaps with an admixture of Thracian ancestry. Though it has been proposed that Andros was originally dependent on Eretria, by the 7th century BC it had become sufficiently prosperous to send out several colonies, to Chalcidice (Acanthus, Stageira, Argilus, Sane). The ruins of Palaeopolis, the ancient capital, are on the west coast; the town possessed a famous temple, dedicated to Dionysus. In 480 BC, it supplied ships to Xerxes and was subsequently harried by the Greek fleet. Though enrolled in the Delian League, it remained disaffected towards Athens, and in 477 had to be coerced by the establishment of a cleruchy on the island; nevertheless, in 411 Andros proclaimed its freedom, and in 408 withstood an Athenian attack. As a member of the second Delian League, it was again controlled by a garrison and an archon. In the Hellenistic period, Andros was contended for as a frontier-post by the two naval powers of the Aegean Sea, Macedon and Ptolemaic Egypt. In 333, it received a Macedonian garrison from Antipater; in 308 it was freed by Ptolemy I of Egypt. In the Chremonidean War (266–263) it passed again to Macedon after a battle off its shores. The Ptolemaic empire was at its height, with a considerable fleet stationed at Andros.

In 200, it was captured by a combined Roman, Pergamene and Rhodian fleet, and remained a possession of the Attalid kingdom until its dissolution in 133 BC, when it was granted to Rome.

===Middle Ages===
During the long centuries of Byzantine rule, Andros was relatively obscure. First part of the Roman province of the Islands, it later became part of the theme (Byzantine district) of the Aegean Sea. Like other Aegean islands, it suffered Saracen raids, but during the Komnenian period the island flourished due to its silk production, exporting gossamer and velvet fabrics to Western Europe.

Andros was captured by the Fourth Crusade on its way to Constantinople in 1203. After the fall of Constantinople in 1204, the island was slated to come under control of the Republic of Venice according to the &quot;Partitio Romaniae&quot;; in 1207 it became part of the Duchy of the Archipelago under Marco I Sanudo, who in turn gave it to Marino Dandolo as a sub-fief. Probably sometime around 1239, Dandolo was expelled from the island by Geremia Ghisi, ruler of Skiathos, Skopelos, and Skyros. Dandolo died soon after and a case was brought before the Venetian courts against Ghisi by Dandolo&#x27;s widow Felisa and his sister Maria Doro. Felisa was soon aided by the Venetian Jacopo Querini, who became her second husband. Although the Venetian court found in their favour in August 1243 and ordered the Ghisi brothers to give up Andros, this did not happen. The case dragged on until after Geremia&#x27;s death, when Duke Angelo Sanudo took over the island. He eventually gave half of it, according to the feudal law current in Latin Greece, to Felisa. The case took on new life after Felisa died and no claimant made appearance. Duke Marco II Sanudo then reverted the entire island to the ducal domain, but just two days before the legal deadline of two years and two days had passed, Marino&#x27;s grandson Nicholas Querini appeared in Naxos to claim his inheritance. The case was again brought before the courts of Venice, but Sanudo disputed the Republic&#x27;s authority over his domain. The case was eventually settled through the mediation of Nicolò Giustinian, the Venetian &quot;bailo&quot; of Negroponte in 1291–93, whereby Querini renounced his claims in exchange for a cash payment of 5,000 pounds. Thus Andros remained in the hands of the Sanudo dukes, who henceforth styled themselves &quot;Lords of the duchy of Naxos and Andros&quot; and occasionally chose the castle of Andros as their residence. In 1292, Andros, along with other of the Cyclades, was raided by the Aragonese fleet under Roger de Lluria.
In December 1371, the island was granted as a fief to Maria Sanudo, half-sister of the last Sanudo duke, Nicholas III dalle Carceri. In 1383, Nicholas III was murdered and Francesco I Crispo became the new duke, giving Andros with Syros to his daughter and her husband, Pietro Zeno, the son of the Venetian &quot;bailo&quot; of Negroponte. Zeno was a very able diplomat, but even he found it difficult to manoeuvre among the various competing powers of the era. Unlike Syros, Paros, and other islands, which had been left destitute and almost depopulated by the Ottoman raids, Andros managed to escape relatively unscathed, but in return Zeno was forced to pay tribute and provide harbour and shelter for the Turkish ships. Nevertheless, in 1416, the island was raided and almost the entire population carried off by the Ottomans. At about the same time Albanians crossed from Euboea over into the island, settling in its northern part.

In 1431, when the Venetians ravaged the Genoese colony of Chios, the Genoese seized Andros and Naxos, both under Venetian protection, in retaliation, and only adroit diplomacy by the dukes of the Archipelago managed to prevent the islands&#x27; outright annexation by Genoa. In 1427, Pietro Zeno died, and was succeeded by his son Andrea, who was of poor health and only had a daughter. In 1437, Andrea too died, and the island was seized by Andrea&#x27;s uncles, who aimed to wed Andrea&#x27;s daughter to their son when she came of age, and thus legalize their control of Andros. Venice quickly reacted and took over the island, installing a governor there while her courts heard the cases of all the claimants. One of them was Maria Sanudo&#x27;s son Crusino I Sommaripa, Lord of Paros and Triarch of Negroponte. Like his mother, he never abandoned his claims on the island, and eventually was vindicated by the Venetian courts. After compensating the Zeno family, he took possession of the island in 1440.

Andros suffered once again heavily from Turkish attacks during the Ottoman–Venetian War of 1463–1479. In 1468 four ships attacked the island, killing baron Giovanni Sommaripa and carrying off numerous prisoners and booty worth 15,000 ducats. Two years later the Ottomans raided the island again, carrying off so many of its population that the island was left with 2,000 inhabitants. Despite these disasters, the two Sommaripa possessions of Andros and Paros remained the most prosperous islands in the Cyclades in the period, and the Sommaripa rulers of Andros acted independently of their theoretical suzerain at Naxos, even to the point of claiming the title of duke for themselves. By the 1500s, however, the two Sommaripa branches of Andros and Paros were at war with each other, as a result of which many Andrians were carried off to Paros. In addition, the Andrians suffered from the cruelty of their own &quot;duke&quot;, Francesco, to the point that they sent an embassy to Venice threatening to call in the Turks if nothing was done. The Venetians responded by removing Francesco to Venice in 1507, and installing a governor of their own for the next seven years.

In the event, Sommaripa rule was restored when Venice recognized Alberto Sommaripa as the rightful heir. The island was seized by the Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa in 1537, but Crusino III Sommaripa managed to regain it through the intercession of the French ambassador, in exchange for an annual tribute of 35,000 &quot;akçes&quot; to the Ottoman governor at Negroponte.

===Ottoman period===
When the Ottomans annexed Naxos in 1566, at the behest of the local Greeks, the Andrians too decided to rise up against their ruler, Gianfrancesco Sommaripa. Although the latter managed to escape with his life, Andros too now came under Ottoman control. For the next thirteen years, the entirety of the former Duchy of the Archipelago was granted to the Sultan&#x27;s favourite, Joseph Nasi, who ruled the islands via representatives and was mostly concerned with using them as a source of wealth. Upon Nasi&#x27;s death, the Greeks of Andros and Naxos requested from the Sultan that the descendants of their old dynasties be restored as Turkish vassals, but in the end, the islands were directly annexed as a province; in 1580, however, the Cyclades were granted a charter of privileges that granted them considerable local autonomy, low taxes and religious freedom, a situation that remained throughout the period of Ottoman rule. In the early 1770s, during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–74, the island was occupied by the Russians and used as a base for their operations in the Aegean.

===Modern period===
On May 10, 1821, Theophilos Kairis, one of the leading Greek intellectuals, declared the island&#x27;s participation in the Greek War of Independence by raising the Greek flag at the Church of St George. At this time, a famous heartfelt speech, or &quot;ritoras&quot; (ρήτορας), inspired shipowners and merchants to contribute funds to build a Greek Navy to combat the Ottomans. At the end of the war, the island became part of the independent Kingdom of Greece.

Following Independence, Andros became a major centre of Greek shipping. In this it was helped by the arrival of refugees from Psara, and the decline of other traditional shipping centres such as Galaxeidi and Hydra Island. Andrian merchants were particularly active in the grain trade from central and eastern Europe conducted from the Danube estuary. Initially locally constructed, Andrian ships were later built at Syros, especially as shipping began the transit to steam. By 1914, Andrian-registered shipping was second in Greece in terms of capacity. After World War I, the local registered ships rose from 25 (1921) to 80 before World War II. The losses suffered during the latter, as well as the internationalization of shipping and emigration of the ship-owning families to Piraeus and London, signalled the end of Andrian shipping.

==Administration==
Andros is a separate regional unit of the South Aegean region, and the only municipality of the regional unit. As part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the regional unit Andros was created out of part of the former Cyclades Prefecture. At the same reform, the current municipality Andros was created out of the 3 former municipalities:

*Andros (town)
*Korthio
*Ydrousa

===Province===
The province of Andros () was one of the provinces of the Cyclades Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current regional unit Andros. It was abolished in 2006.

==Population==
In 1900, Andros, the capital, had about 2,000 inhabitants, and the island as a whole had a population of about 18,000. The 1991 census showed that number had dropped to 8,781. According to the 2011 Greek census, the town of Andros still numbered 1,665 inhabitants, and the island&#x27;s total was 9,221. The island is composed of the municipal units of Andros (town) (pop. 3,901), Korthio (pop. 1,948), and Ydrousa (pop. 3,372). The north of Andros has a small Arvanite community. The name of the island in Arvanitika is Ε̰νdρα, &quot;Ëndra&quot;.

<text>Milos or Melos (; , ; ) is a volcanic Greek island in the Aegean Sea, just north of the Sea of Crete. Milos is the southwestern-most island in the Cyclades group.

The &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; (now in the Louvre), the &quot;Poseidon of Melos&quot; (now in the NAMA) and the &quot;Asclepius of Milos&quot; (now in the British Museum) were all found on the island, as was an archaic Apollo now in Athens. Milos is a popular tourist destination during the summer. The municipality of Milos also includes the uninhabited offshore islands of Antimilos and Akradies. The combined land area is and at the 2021 census the population was 5,193 inhabitants.

==History==
Obsidian (a glass-like volcanic rock) from Milos was a commodity as early as 15,000 years ago. Natural glass from Milos was transported over long distances and used for razor-sharp &quot;stone tools&quot; well before farming began and later: &quot;There is no early farming village in the Near East that doesn&#x27;t get obsidian&quot;. The mining of obsidian did not lead to the development of permanent habitation or manufacturing on the island. Instead, those in search of obsidian arrived by boat, beaching it in a suitable cove and cutting pieces of the volcanic glass from the quarries.

The position of Milos, between mainland Greece and Crete, and its possession of obsidian, made it an important centre of early Aegean civilisation. Milos lost its arms-making importance when bronze became the preferred material for the manufacture of weapons.

===The Bronze Age===
The first settlement at Phylakopi (Greek Φυλακωπή) arose in the Bronze Age, flourishing as the extraction of obsidian was in the decline. The first settlers were tuna fishermen. Lying on the north-east coast, 1896 excavations by the British School at Athens and later in 1973 by the British archaeologist Colin Renfrew, revealed a town wall and a Minoan-inspired structure, dubbed the Pillar room, which contained fragments of vivid wall paintings. The famous fresco of the flying fish was found in the ruins of the Pillar room and was executed with delicate colouring and graphic observation of nature in the graceful movement of a fish. Stylistic similarities to Minoan frescoes are suggested, and it could perhaps have been the work of a Cretan artist. Part of the site has been washed away by the sea.

The antiquities found at the site covered three major periods, from the Early Cycladic period to the Mycenaean period. At the site much pottery was excavated, with several changing styles and influences over the site&#x27;s long occupation. In the early occupation of the site, there are many similarities and imports from other Cycladic islands and the settlement was very small. During the Middle Bronze Age however, the site expanded significantly and the expansion of Minoan Crete saw an influx of Minoan pottery into the Cyclades, particularly at Akrotiri on Thera, though much found its way to Phylakopi. The quantities found at the Cycladic sites have been taken to suggest a Minoan control over the region, though it could also be the consumptive nature of the islanders adopting Cretan fashions. There is more than just pottery at Phylakopi however, the eruption of the Thera volcano saw a reduction in Minoan presence in the Cyclades and it is at this time that Mycenaean involvement on the islands increases. At Phylakopi (and unknown in the rest of the Cyclades) a megaron structure, which is typically associated with the Mycenaean palaces, such as those at Tiryns, Pylos and Mycenae has been discovered. This has been taken to suggest that the Mycenaeans conquered the settlement and installed a seat of power for a governor. The evidence is not clear, though again it could be a legacy of the islanders adopting foreign elements into their culture. Particularly unexpected was the discovery in the 1970s of a shrine at the site, which contained many examples of Aegean figurines, including the famous &quot;Lady of Phylakopi&quot;. The shrine is unprecedented in the Bronze Age Cyclades and has provided a valuable insight into the beliefs and rituals of the inhabitants of Phylakopi. The site was eventually abandoned and was never reoccupied.

===Dorian settlement===

The first Dorian settlement on Melos was established no earlier than the 1st millennium BC. Dorians are the ethnic group to which the Spartans belonged, but the Dorian settlers of Melos made themselves independent. They eventually established a city whose site lies on the eastern shore of the bay, just south-west of the present-day community of Trypiti.

From the 6th century BC up to the siege of 416 BC, Melos issued its own coinage, struck according to the Milesian weight standard: the base coin was the &quot;stater&quot; which weighed just over 14 grams. Melos was the only island in the Aegean Sea to use this standard. Most coins bore the image of an apple, which is a pun because the ancient Greek word for &quot;apple&quot; (&quot;mêlon&quot;) sounded similar to the name of the island. The coins also often bore the name of its people: ΜΑΛΙΟΝ (&quot;Malion&quot;) or some abbreviation thereof.

By the 6th century BC, the Melians had also learned to write, and they used an archaic variant of the ancient Greek script that exhibited Cretan and Theraic influences. It was discarded after the siege of 416 BC.

From at least as early as 470 BC and ending with the siege of 416 BC, the Melians exported terracotta reliefs, which were typically use as door or chest ornaments and depicted scenes from mythology.

During the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC, the Melians refused to submit to Persia and contributed two warships to the Greek war effort, which were used at the Battle of Salamis. After the battle, the Melians returned to their traditional isolationism.

===Siege of 416 BC===

During the Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, the Melians made some small donations to the Spartan war effort, but remained largely neutral despite sharing the Spartans&#x27; Dorian ethnicity. In 426 BC, the Athenians raided the Melian countryside, and the following year demanded tribute, but Melos refused. In the summer of 416 BC, Athens invaded again with 3,400 men, and demanded that Melos ally with them against Sparta, or be destroyed. The Melians rejected this, so the Athenian army laid siege to the city and eventually captured it in the winter. After the city&#x27;s fall, the Athenians executed all the adult men, and sold the women and children into slavery. They then settled 500 of their own colonists on the island.

In 405 BC, with Athens losing the war, the Spartan general Lysander expelled the Athenian settlers from Melos and repatriated the survivors of the siege. Sparta annexed Melos, which would mean that like other liberated islands, it received a military governor (a &quot;harmost&quot;). The cultural distinctiveness of Melos faded away as it was absorbed into mainstream Greek culture. Their coinage switched to the Rhodian standard (tetradrachms weighing 15.3 g) and ceased bearing the word ΜΑΛΙΟΝ. The production of its terracotta reliefs also ceased.

===The Hellenistic period===
In 338 BC, Philip II of Macedon defeated the Greeks at the Battle of Chaeroneia and became the overlord of Greece and the Cyclades. During this time, Melos and the nearby island Kimolos disputed each other over the ownership of the islands of Polyaigos, Heterea, and Libea (the last two are probably today&#x27;s uninhabited islands of Agios Efstathios and Agios Georgios). In the past, this dispute would have been settled by war, but the two communities took their dispute to Argos on the Greek mainland. The Argives decided the islands belonged to Kimolos.

===The Roman and Byzantine period===
In 197 BC, the Romans forced Philip V to withdraw from Greece, and Melos subsequently came under Roman influence.

During the early 9th century CE the Cyclades were harassed by Arab raiders, though how Milos fared at this time is unclear. Milos was mentioned in a Byzantine chrysobull of 1198, which shows it was still important to the Byzantines.

===Medieval period===

In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade (1204), the Venetian Marco Sanudo seized control of Milos and a number of other islands in the Cyclades. Sanudo declared himself the Duke of Naxos, after the island where he established his capital. Sanudo did not make his duchy a vassal of Venice, but instead declared loyalty to the Latin Emperor. Sanudo&#x27;s dynasty lasted nine generations, then was succeeded by the Crispos. Both families were Catholic. The majority of the population was (and still is) Greek Orthodox.

Up to this point, the population of Melos was overwhelmingly Greek Orthodox Christian, just like the rest of the archipelago. When the Venetians conquered the archipelago, they brought Catholicism with them. The first Catholic bishop of Milos was appointed in 1253.

===Ottoman period===
In 1566 the Venetians handed over the Duchy of Naxos to the Ottoman Empire, and its last Catholic duke fled to Venice. The Ottoman sultan Selim II appointed a Portuguese Jew named Joseph Nasi as its duke. Upon Nasi&#x27;s death in 1579, the Ottomans formally annexed the territory.
In the early 18th century, the population surpassed 6,000 and was almost entirely Greek and Christian. It was ruled by Turkish judge or &quot;kadi&quot;, and a Turkish governor or &quot;voivode&quot;. The &quot;voivode&quot; was responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing the decisions of the &quot;kadi&quot;. The day-to-day affairs of the island were managed by three elected magistrates (&quot;epitropi&quot;), although any of their decisions could be appealed to the &quot;kadi&quot;. The island had two bishops: one Greek Orthodox and one Latin Catholic. The Greek bishop was wealthier than his Latin counterpart, as he had a larger revenue base. Although the islanders enjoyed a great degree of autonomy, they chafed under the heavy taxation of their Ottoman overlords.

In 1771 the island was occupied by the Russian Empire for three years, then retaken by the Ottomans.

In the late 18th century, the population declined considerably for uncertain reasons. By 1798, it had fallen below 500 people. Visitors reported that up to two thirds of the buildings had fallen into ruin. It began growing again in the early 19th century, reaching 5,000 people by 1821. Reliable figures are hard to find as the Ottoman Empire never performed a census before 1881.

===Modern period===
Milos was one of the first islands to join the Greek War of Independence of 1821. The first naval battle of the war took place off the coast of Milos on 11 April 1821. Milos became a refuge for refugees from numerous islands, particularly Crete. The port town of Adamantas was founded by Cretan refugees from the Cretan Revolt in 1841.

When Theodore Bent toured the island in December 1883, note-taking for his guide to the Cyclades, he found that “There is a lack of energy nowadays in Melos, for Syra monopolises all the trade that once came here, and the Cretan exiles refuse to cultivate as they ought the fertile centre of the island, for they are only awaiting a favourable turn in events to return to their own island…”

During the 19th century, Milos was a major rendezvous point for American and British ships fighting Muslim pirates in the Mediterranean.

In February 1943, 14 male civilians were executed for collecting material owned by the German occupation forces that was washed up after the sinking of a cargo ship by Allied aircraft.

The population peaked in 1928 at 6,562 people. In 2011 it was 4,977.

== Geography ==
Milos is the southwestern-most island in the Cyclades, due east from the coast of Laconia. From east to west it measures about , from north to south , and its area is estimated at . The greater portion is rugged and hilly, culminating in Mount Profitis Elias in the west. Like the rest of the cluster, the island is of volcanic origin, with tuff, trachyte and obsidian among its ordinary rocks. Volcanic activity began 2 to 3 million years ago during the Pliocene, and last erupted 90,000 years ago during the Pleistocene, and is considered to still be a dormant volcano that could erupt again. The natural harbour is the hollow of the principal crater, which, with a depth diminishing from 70 to 30 fathoms (130–55 m), strikes in from the northwest so as to separate the island into two fairly equal portions (&quot;see photo&quot;), with an isthmus not more than broad. In one of the caves on the south coast, the heat from the volcano is still great, and on the eastern shore of the harbour, there are hot sulfurous springs.

Antimelos or Antimilos, north-west of Milos, is an uninhabited mass of trachyte, often called Erimomilos (Desert Milos). Kimolos, or Argentiera, to the north-east, was famous in antiquity for its figs and fuller&#x27;s earth, and contained a considerable city, the remains of which cover the cliff of St. Andrew&#x27;s. Polyaigos (also called Polinos, Polybos or Polivo — alternative spelling Polyaegos) lies south-east of Kimolos. It was the subject of dispute between the Milians and Kimolians. It is now uninhabited.

The harbour town is Adamantas; from this there is an ascent to the plateau above the harbour, on which are situated Plaka, the chief town, and Kastro, rising on a hill above it, and other villages. The ancient town of Milos was nearer to the entrance of the harbour than Adamas, and occupied the slope between the village of Trypiti and the landing-place at Klima. Here is a theatre of Roman date and some remains of town walls and other buildings, one with a fine mosaic excavated by the British school at Athens in 1896. Numerous fine works of art have been found on this site, notably the Aphrodite in Paris, the Asclepius in London, and the Poseidon and the archaic Apollo in Athens. Other villages include Triovasalos, Peran Triovasalos, Pollonia and Zefyria (Kampos).

===Climate===
Milos has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with mild, rainy winters and warm to hot dry summers.

== Natural resources ==
=== Volcanic minerals ===


Bentonite, perlite, pozzolana and small quantities of kaolin are actively collected via strip mine or open-pit mine techniques in Milos and sold all over the world. In the past, baryte, sulfur, millstones and gypsum were also mined; Pliny the Elder notes that Milos was the most abundant source of sulfur in the ancient world. In ancient times the alum of Milos was reckoned next to that of Egypt (Pliny xxxv. 15 [52]). The Melian earth was employed as a pigment by ancient artists. Milos was a source of obsidian during the Neolithic ages for the Aegean and Mediterranean.

=== Agricultural crops ===
Orange, olive, cypress, tamarisk, juniper (&quot;Juniperus oxycedrus&quot;) and arbutus trees grow throughout the island, which, however, is too dry to have any profusion of vegetation. Vines, cotton, and barley are the main crops.

=== Medicinal plants ===
Almost all of the uninhabited western region of Milos is a Natura 2000 site and is home to over 800 different taxa, including 35 which are endemic to Greece. In an ethnobotanical survey of Milos, numerous native and cultivated species were described as being used to treat a variety of conditions and for other purposes such as insect repellents, disinfectants, and to protect against the evil eye. The most frequently reported species was Greek sage. Local historical records of medicinal plant use date back to the 16th century.
