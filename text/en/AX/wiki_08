<text>The Horten H.IX, RLM designation Ho 229 (or Gotha Go 229 for extensive re-design work done by Gotha to prepare the aircraft for mass production) was a German prototype fighter/bomber designed by Reimar and Walter Horten to be built by Gothaer Waggonfabrik. Developed at a late stage of the Second World War, it was one of the first flying wing aircraft to be powered by jet engines.

The Ho 229 was designed in response to a call made in 1943 by Hermann Göring, the head of the Luftwaffe, for light bombers capable of meeting the &quot;3×1000&quot; requirement; namely, to carry of bombs a distance of with a speed of . Only jet propulsion could achieve the required speed, but such engines were very fuel-hungry, necessitating considerable effort across the rest of the design to meet the range requirement. The flying wing configuration was favoured by the Horten brothers due to its high aerodynamic efficiency, as demonstrated by their Horten H.IV glider. In order to minimise drag, the Ho 229 was not fitted with extraneous flight control surfaces. Its ceiling was . The Ho 229 was the only design that came close to the requirements, and the Horten brothers quickly received an order for three prototypes after the project gained Göring&#x27;s approval.

Due to the Horten brothers&#x27; lack of suitable production facilities, Ho 229 manufacturing was contracted out to Gothaer Waggonfabrik; however, the company allegedly undermined the project by seeking the favour of Luftwaffe officials for its own flying wing design. On 1 March 1944 the first prototype H.IX &quot;V1&quot;, an unpowered glider, made its maiden flight, followed by the H.IX &quot;V2&quot;, powered by Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet engines in December 1944. However, on 18 February 1945 the V2 was destroyed in a crash, killing its test pilot. Despite as many as 100 production aircraft being on order, none were completed. The nearly complete H.IX &quot;V3&quot; prototype was captured by the American military and shipped to the United States under Operation Paperclip. It was evaluated by both British and American researchers before entering long term storage. The H.IX &quot;V3&quot; is on static display in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

==Design and development==
During the early 1930s the Horten brothers had become interested in the flying wing configuration as a method of improving the performance of gliders. At that time the German government was actively funding glider clubs as a response to the production of aircraft suitable for military roles being forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. The flying wing layout theoretically offered the lowest possible weight, and without the added drag of the fuselage. Their first aircraft of this configuration was the Horten H.IV.

In 1943 Hermann Göring issued a request for design proposals for a bomber capable of carrying a load over at which was known as the &quot;3×1000 project&quot;. German bombers could reach Allied targets across Great Britain, but were suffering devastating losses from Allied fighters. At the time, no conventional means for aircraft designers to meet these goals seemed viable because while the new Junkers Jumo 004B turbojets provided the speed, excessive fuel consumption limited range. The Horten brothers concluded that a low-drag flying wing design could meet the goals, as by reducing drag, cruise power could be reduced so the range requirement could then be met. They put forward their private project, the &quot;H.IX&quot;, as the basis for the bomber.

While removing the vertical stabilizer reduced drag, it caused yaw control problems. In traditional aircraft, a vertical stabilizer works passively to ensure that sideslip is minimized by producing a force perpendicular to itself when any sideslip occurs. The lack of a vertical stabilizer meant that flying without any active yaw control would lead to an uncontrolled sideslip, and potentially flat spins. This was resolved with split ailerons, which increase drag on one side. While designs without vertical stabilizers require more active control by the pilot or a future flight control systems and lead to bank angle restrictions, they do reduce aerodynamic drag slightly.

The Government Air Ministry (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot;) quickly approved Horten&#x27;s proposal, but ordered the addition of two cannons, as they felt the aircraft might also be useful as a fighter due to it being significantly faster than existing Allied aircraft. German officials assigned the designation &quot;Ho 229&quot; to the aircraft. Göring was reportedly impressed with the design and personally intervened to ensure that three prototypes were ordered at a cost of 500,000 Reichsmarks. The Air Ministry issued an order for 100 production aircraft, but this was later reduced to 20. Furthermore, as the Horten brothers lacked production facilities, it was decided that the manufacturing would be done by an established company, Gothaer Waggonfabrik. This arrangement was complicated by Gothaer&#x27;s alleged efforts to persuade the authorities to favour its own projects, which included flying wings, over the Ho 229.

Observing the Ho 229&#x27;s design and development difficulties, Russell Lee, the chair of the Aeronautics Department at the National Air and Space Museum, speculated that an important motivation for the Horten brothers was to prevent them and their workers from being assigned dangerous roles by the German military. Looking beyond the Ho 229, the Horten brothers produced numerous flying wing designs, such as the Horten H.VII fighter-trainer and the Horten H.XVIII Amerikabomber. According to the aviation historian Jean-Denis G.G. LePage, other German wartime projects were inspired by the Horten brother&#x27;s work.

The H.IX was of mixed construction with the center section built up from welded steel tubing with a diameter up to , while the outer box wing spars were of pine.

The outer wings were skinned with thin plywood panels that were glued together with a sawdust mixture and covered with fireproof paint. The wing had a single main spar, penetrated by the jet engine inlets, and a secondary spar used for mounting the elevons. It was designed with a 7g load factor and a 1.8× safety rating giving the aircraft a 12.6g ultimate load rating. The wing&#x27;s chord/thickness ratio ranged from 15% at the root to 8% at the wingtips. There was little available interior space, making the addition of additional equipment or crew members difficult or impossible.

The aircraft was fitted with retractable tricycle landing gear, with the nose gear on the first two prototypes from a Heinkel He 177&#x27;s tailwheel system, with the third prototype using an He 177A main gear wheel rim and tire on a newly designed nose gear leg. A drogue parachute slowed the aircraft upon landing. The pilot sat on a primitive ejection seat and a special pressure suit was developed by Dräger. While originally designed for the BMW 003 turbojet engine, this engine was not ready, and the Junkers Jumo 004 engine was substituted. Flight control was achieved via a combination of elevons and spoilers. This control system included both long-span (inboard) and short-span (outboard) spoilers, with the smaller outboard spoilers activated first; it reportedly provided a smoother control of yaw than would have been by a single-spoiler system.

==Operational history==
===Testing and evaluation===
The first prototype H.IX V1, an unpowered glider with fixed tricycle landing gear, was first flown on 1 March 1944. Flight results were favorable, but there was an accident when the pilot attempted to land without first retracting a test instrument. Following the transference of design responsibility from the Horten brothers to Gothaer Waggonfabrik, the company&#x27;s design team implemented several changes, including adding a simple ejection seat, substantially redesigned the undercarriage to enable a higher gross weight, changes to the engine intakes, and they added ducting to air-cool the jet engine&#x27;s outer casing to prevent damage to adjacent wood.

The H.IX V1 was followed in December 1944 by the Junkers Jumo 004-powered second prototype H.IX V2. The BMW 003 engine was preferred but was not available. Göring believed in the design and ordered a production series of 40 aircraft from Gothaer Waggonfabrik with the RLM designation Ho 229, even though it had not yet taken to the air under jet power. On 2 February 1945, the first flight of the H.IX V2 was conducted at Oranienburg. The Horten brothers were unable to witness this flight as they were occupied with producing the design for a new turbojet-powered strategic bomber in response to the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; competition. All of the subsequent test flights and development were conducted by Gothaer Waggonfabrik. The test pilot was &quot;Leutnant&quot; Erwin Ziller. Two further test flights were performed on 2 February 1945 and on 18 February 1945.

Two weeks later, on 18 February 1945, disaster struck during the third test flight. After about 45 minutes in the air, at an altitude of around 800 m, one of the engines caught fire and stopped. Ziller was seen to put the aircraft into a dive and pull up several times in an attempt to restart the engine. Ziller made a series of four complete turns at 20° angle of bank. He did not use his radio or eject, and may already have been unconscious from the fumes from the burning engine. It crashed just outside the airfield boundary and Ziller later died from his injuries while the aircraft was destroyed.

Despite this, the project continued. On 12 March 1945, nearly a week after the U.S. Army had launched Operation Lumberjack to cross the Rhine River, the Ho 229 was included in the &quot;Jäger-Notprogramm&quot; (Emergency Fighter Program) for the accelerated production of inexpensive &quot;wonder weapons&quot;. The prototype workshop was moved to the Gothaer Waggonfabrik (Gotha) in Friedrichroda, western Thuringia. The same month, work was started on the third prototype, the Ho 229 V3.

The V3 was larger than previous prototypes, the shape being modified in various areas, and it was meant to be a template for the pre-production series Ho 229 A-0 day fighters, of which 20 had been ordered. The V3 was to be powered by two Jumo 004C engines, each with 10% greater thrust than the earlier Jumo 004B engine used for the Me 262A and Ar 234B, and had two MK 108 cannons in the wing roots. Work had also started on the two-seat V4 and night-fighter V5 prototypes, the V6 armament test prototype, and the V7 two-seat trainer.

In April 1945, George Patton’s Third Army found four Horten prototypes, the Ho 229s and a Horten glider. Of three Ho 229s, the V3 was nearest to completion, and was shipped to the United States for evaluation. The Ho 229 spent a brief time at RAE Farnborough in the UK and during this time installing British jet engines was considered, but the mountings were incompatible with the larger diameter British turbojets. It is uncertain if the aircraft&#x27;s original Junkers engines were ever run, although the American evaluation team at one point intended to fly it.

==Surviving aircraft==
The only surviving Ho 229 airframe, the V3—and the only surviving Second World War-era German jet prototype still in existence—is on display in the main hall of the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum (NASM) alongside other WWII-era German aircraft. It is displayed partially restored, the wings of the aircraft displayed separately from the center section.

Prior to being placed on display in 2017, it was stored at the NASM&#x27;s Paul E. Garber Restoration Facility in Suitland, Maryland, U.S. In December 2011, the National Air and Space Museum moved the Ho 229 into the active restoration area of the Garber Restoration Facility, where it was reviewed for full restoration and display.
The central section of the V3 prototype was moved to the NASM&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in late 2012 to commence a detailed examination of it before starting any serious conservation/restoration efforts and was cleared for the move to the Udvar-Hazy facility&#x27;s restoration shops by summer 2014. Following work performed within the Udvar-Hazy facility&#x27;s Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar, it was put on display.

==Claimed stealth technology==

===Radar absorbent material===
In 1983, after hearing details of the US stealth system, Reimar Horten advanced a claim that he had intended to add charcoal dust to the wood glue to absorb electromagnetic waves (radar), to shield the aircraft from the British early-warning ground-based radar system known as Chain Home. This charcoal glue treatment was supposedly planned for the unbuilt production aircraft however, the V3 prototype did not make use of charcoal, and no documentation has been found supporting the claim.

Northrop Grumman engineers conducted electromagnetic tests on the V3&#x27;s multilayer wood nose cone in 2008. They tested across a frequency range of 12 to 117 THz, with a 10 micron wavelength. The cone was thick and made from thin sheets of veneer. The team observed that the &quot;Ho 229 leading edge has the same characteristics as the plywood [of the control sample] except that the frequencies have a slightly shorter bandwidth,&quot; which they go on to conclude was likely due to oxidization of the wood. The team, who assumed the presence of carbon black from visual inspection alone, concluded that the &quot;similarity of the two tests indicates that the design using the carbon black type material produced a poor absorber.&quot; The Smithsonian Institution then performed a study of the materials used on the prototype, and determined that there is &quot;no evidence of carbon black or charcoal&quot;, refuting the hypothesis.

===Radar cross section and shape===
A jet-powered flying wing such as the Horten Ho 229 might have a smaller radar cross-section (RCS) than conventional contemporary twin-engine aircraft because the wings are blended into the fuselage and there are no large propeller disks or vertical and horizontal tail surfaces to provide a typical identifiable radar signature, however the front and rear faces of the exposed jet engines do provide a similar degree of reflectivity to propellers.

In early 2008, Northrop Grumman paired television documentary producer Michael Jorgensen and the National Geographic Channel to make a documentary to determine whether the Ho 229 was the first &quot;stealth&quot; aircraft. Northrop Grumman built a full-size non-flying reproduction of the V3, primarily made of wood, unlike the original aircraft, which had an extensive steel space-frame to which the wooden skin was bolted. After an expenditure of about US$250,000 and 2,500 man-hours, Northrop&#x27;s Ho 229 reproduction was tested at the company&#x27;s Radar Cross Section test range at Tejon, California, US where it was placed on a pole and exposed to electromagnetic energy sources from various angles from , using three HF/VHF frequencies in the 20–50 MHz range.

Radar simulations showed a hypothetical Ho 229, with the radar characteristics of the mockup, which had neither metal frame nor the highly reflective engines, approaching the English coast from France flying at at above the water would still have been visible to an old and by then already retired model of the Chain Home radar at a distance of 80% that of a Bf 109, while all other systems showed no significant change.

<text>The Merrimack River (or Merrimac River, an occasional earlier spelling) is a river in the northeastern United States. It rises at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers in Franklin, New Hampshire, flows southward into Massachusetts, and then flows northeast until it empties into the Gulf of Maine at Newburyport. From Pawtucket Falls in Lowell, Massachusetts, onward, the Massachusetts–New Hampshire border is roughly calculated as the line three miles north of the river.

The Merrimack is an important regional focus in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The central-southern part of New Hampshire and most of northeast Massachusetts is known as the Merrimack Valley.

Several U.S. naval ships have been named and USS &quot;Merrimac&quot; in honor of this river. The river is also known for the early American literary classic &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot; by Henry David Thoreau.

== Etymology and spelling ==
The etymology of the name of the Merrimack River—from which all subsequent uses derive, such as the name of the Civil War ironclad—remains uncertain.

There is some evidence that it is Native American. In 1604 the natives of later New England told Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts, who was leading a colony of French language speakers to Acadia (later Nova Scotia), of a beautiful river to the south. The French promptly pronounced its native name as &quot;Merremack&quot;. In 1605 Samuel de Champlain followed this lead, found the river and renamed it &quot;Riviere du Gas&quot;.

The French and their name did not remain on the Merrimack. The natives dwelling along the river at the time of European exploration included the Agawam and Naumkeag on the lower reaches, the Pawtucket at Lowell, Massachusetts, the Nashua, Souhegan and Namoskeag around Manchester, New Hampshire, the Pennacook northward from Bow, New Hampshire, and the Winnepisseogee at the source, Lake Winnipesaukee.

According to Joseph B. Walker, relying on Chandler Eastman Potter&#x27;s &quot;The History of Manchester&quot; (1856), &quot;Merremack&quot; contains the elements &quot;merruh&quot; (&quot;strong&quot;) and &quot;auke&quot; (&quot;place&quot;—a recognizable locative ending), and means &quot;the place of strong current,- a term not inappropriate, when we consider ... the river&#x27;s rapids ...&quot; Potter was an authority on Native American affairs in colonial New England. By contrast, in &quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot;, Henry David Thoreau implies that &quot;its name signifies the Sturgeon River.&quot;

Walker goes on to cite spellings of &quot;Merimacke&quot;, &quot;Merimack&quot; and &quot;Merrimacke&quot; in &quot;the colonial records of Massachusetts&quot;, as well as the &quot;Merrimake&quot; and &quot;Merrymake&quot; of a 1721 land grant at Penacook, New Hampshire. William Wood&#x27;s &quot;New England&#x27;s Prospect&quot; of 1634 calls the river the &quot;Merrimacke&quot; and locates it eight miles beyond Agowamme (Ipswich, Massachusetts). It hosts, he says, &quot;Sturgeon, Sammon and Basse, and divers other kinds of fish.&quot;

Merrimac, Massachusetts, settled in 1638 and originally part of Amesbury, Massachusetts, was called West Amesbury until 1876, at which time it adopted its current name and spelling. Merrimack, New Hampshire, was incorporated in 1746, spelling its name &quot;Marrymac&quot; in the record of its first town meeting. It was referred to as &quot;Merrimac&quot; into the early 19th century: in the 1810 decennial census, it was spelled &quot;Merrimac&quot;, but in the 1820 census and afterward, &quot;Merrimack&quot;.

In 1914, US Congressman John Jacob Rogers (MA) petitioned that the official spelling be &quot;Merrimack&quot;.

== History ==
Prior to glaciation, the Merrimack continued its southward course far beyond the present day New Hampshire-Massachusetts border to enter the Gulf of Maine near Boston. Upon the glacier&#x27;s retreat, debris deposited north of Boston filled the lower Merrimack Valley, redirecting the river into its current northeast bend at Lowell. The Neville archaeological site is located along the river&#x27;s banks in New Hampshire.

On the Merrimack River&#x27;s banks are a number of cities built to take advantage of water power in the 19th century, when textile mills dominated the New England economy: Concord, Manchester, and Nashua in New Hampshire, and Lowell, Lawrence, and Haverhill in Massachusetts. At the mouth of the river is the small city of Newburyport. Prior to the construction of the Middlesex Canal, Newburyport was an important shipbuilding city, in a location to receive New Hampshire timber that had been floated downriver.

==Geography==
The Merrimack River watershed covers in southern New Hampshire and northeastern Massachusetts. It is the fourth largest river basin in New England.

The river begins in the city of Franklin, New Hampshire, at the confluence of the Pemigewasset and Winnipesaukee rivers. From there, the river flows south through Concord, Manchester, and Nashua, entering Massachusetts at the town of Tyngsborough, where it turns northeast and winds past or through Chelmsford, Lowell, Dracut, Tewksbury, Andover, Methuen, Lawrence, North Andover, Haverhill, Groveland, West Newbury, Merrimac, and Amesbury, to its mouth at the Gulf of Maine between the city of Newburyport and the town of Salisbury.

===Major sub-basins===
In addition to the Merrimack River mainstem, there are dozens of sub-basins in New Hampshire and Massachusetts making up the watershed. The U.S. Geological Survey categorizes them into six fourth-level sub-basins using hydrological codes with the prefix 0107.

;New Hampshire
* Pemigewasset River (HUC 01070001)
* Winnipesaukee River (HUC 01070002)
* Contoocook River (HUC 01070003)

;New Hampshire and Massachusetts
* Nashua River (HUC 01070004)
* Merrimack River (HUC 01070006; smaller tributaries)

;Massachusetts
* Sudbury/Assabet/Concord rivers (sometimes referred to simply as the Concord Sub-basin or the &quot;SuAsCo&quot; sub-basin) (HUC 01070005)

===Other major rivers===
The following are some of the other significant rivers found within the six major sub-basins in the watershed, listed moving downstream along the Merrimack:

* Soucook River 
* Suncook River 
* Piscataquog River (not to be confused with the Piscataqua River, part of the Piscataqua-Salmon Falls watershed)
* Cohas Brook
* Souhegan River 
* Salmon Brook
* Stony Brook
* Beaver Brook
* Spicket River
* Shawsheen River
* Little River
* Powwow River

== River pollution and restoration ==
===History of pollution===

Since 1951, the Merrimack River has seen many alterations and pollutants. It was dammed and canalled, as well as used as a dumping spot for industrial waste. The Merrimack was essential for textile mill complexes, which used the river for discharge from their factories. Citizens recall that the river had unusual colors, smells, and vegetation as a result of the pollution from textile mills and other human-related waste. In the 1960s, the Merrimack River was one of the ten most polluted waterways in the United States due to years of unmediated dumping of raw sewage, paper and textile mill discharge, and tannery sludge. Phthalates, a group of chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics and detrimental to human bodily systems, were identified in high concentrations within the river in 1973. A 1976 study of the chemical dynamics of the Merrimack River found that at that time, the biggest pollution source was road salt. Although the river underwent significant restoration efforts from the 1970s onwards, a 1997 study found that the river continued to suffer from the long-term effects of pollution. The study identified that the river had elevated bacteria counts, low dissolved oxygen, and high nutrient levels. A few years later, a 2002 statewide water assessment stated that elevated counts of &quot;E. coli&quot; and fecal coliform contributed to the river&#x27;s largest cause of water quality violations. By the 2000s, the largest pollution concern was combined sewer overflow. Wildlife has been impacted through the contamination of shellfishing beds as well as habitat contamination, and aquatic life has been affected due to excess lead, zinc, and other metals in the river. In addition, human recreational activities such as swimming and boating have been restricted in certain areas of the river due to high contamination levels.

===Restoration efforts===

The Federal Clean Water Act of 1972 led to significant improvement for the Merrimack River. The law required sewage to be treated before being discharged into waterways. Federal funding allowed officials to create the river&#x27;s infrastructure, specifically funding for wastewater treatment plants (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 2006). Following these changes in the river&#x27;s infrastructure, there was a noticeable change in wildlife and aquatic life. Birds, fish, and other animals returned to inhabit the river, with citizens noting specifically seeing much more American shad, striped bass, trout, and Atlantic salmon. The involvement of local volunteers in monitoring and maintaining the river has provided effective restoration efforts over the years.

===Current concerns===

The Merrimack River remains one of the most endangered rivers in the United States, as named by the American Rivers nonprofit in 2016. Current concerns include stormwater runoff, urban stormwater, high levels of bacteria, combined sewage runoff, phosphorus creating harmful algal blooms, reduced oxygen levels, illicit sewage discharges, and litter. Combined sewer overflows (CSO) are the largest contributors to waste discharge into the Merrimack River. Currently, there are six sanitary sewer systems from which untreated sewage flows directly into the Merrimack River due to infrastructure issues within the sewage system. Recent research has identified mercury contamination as a significant threat to fish and aquatic life in the Merrimack River. This research analyzes how biological mercury hotspots and watershed transport of mercury might contribute to the exposure of aquatic life to chemical pollution within the Merrimack River. Additionally, the use of road salt in the winter has remained a major pollutant since the 1970s, and chloride contamination in the Merrimack River continues to impact aquatic life.

United States politicians from New Hampshire and Massachusetts are calling for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reassess a permit allowing landfill water to be dumped into the Merrimack River. Politicians are also seeking increased federal funding to update water infrastructure for the Merrimack River, as the river&#x27;s current sewer infrastructure has resulted in the dumping of over 100,000 gallons of untreated water into the river.

== Navigation ==

The Merrimack is listed as one of the Navigable Waters of the United States, subject to Section 10, Rivers and Harbors Act Jurisdiction.

== May 2006 flooding ==
While the Merrimack River is prone to minor flooding, on May 15, 2006, rainfall raised the river more than above flood stage, forcing evacuations, damaging property, and breaking the main sewage pipeline in the city of Haverhill, Massachusetts, dumping of raw sewage waste into the river per day. Reports of total rainfall vary, but most areas appear to have received around a foot of rain with some areas receiving as much as .

According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, around 1,500 people evacuated their homes to escape the flood.

This flood also prompted the Massachusetts city of Lowell to install a modern (albeit temporary) flood control gate comprising square steel beams at the site of the historic Francis Gate, a 19th and 20th-century wooden flood gate. When lowered, the Francis gate seals the city&#x27;s canal system off from its source on the Merrimack. The Great Gate, as it is also called, was built in 1850 under the direction of James B. Francis. Considered unnecessary when it was first constructed, &quot;Francis&#x27; Folly&quot; first saved the city in 1852 and subsequently in 1936.

== Other flooding events ==
The most significant flood in the recorded history of the Merrimack was in March 1936, when a double flood of rain and melting snow and ice swelled the Merrimack at Lowell to , higher than the 2006 flood. Part of the Jack Kerouac book &quot;Doctor Sax&quot; is set during this event.

In addition to the 1936 flood, the 1852 flood, and the Mother&#x27;s Day Flood of 2006, the New England Hurricane of 1938 and floods in October 1996 and April 2007 round out the river&#x27;s most serious flood events, measured at Lowell. The Francis Gate had been left in place after being dropped in 1936, so it prevented flooding in 1938 as well. In 2007, the steel beam system was again assembled in place.

== In media ==
The song &quot;Merrimack River&quot; and its instrumental reprise are featured on the 2009 album &quot;Amanda Leigh&quot; by Nashua, New Hampshire, native Mandy Moore.

Anya Seton&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Avalon&quot; includes a section depicting the fictional Pre-Columbian arrival of 9th century Irish and English travelers at the Merrimack River and their interactions with local Native Americans.

<text>Amin Maalouf (; ; born 25 February 1949) is a Lebanese-born French author who has lived in France since 1976. Although his native language is Arabic, he writes in French, and his works have been translated into over 40 languages. 

Of his several works of nonfiction, &quot;The Crusades Through Arab Eyes&quot; is probably the best known. He received the Prix Goncourt in 1993 for his novel &quot;The Rock of Tanios&quot;, as well as the 2010 Prince of Asturias Award for Literature. He is a member of the Académie française and was elected its Perpetual Secretary on 28 September 2023.

==Background==

Maalouf was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and grew up in the Badaro cosmopolitan neighbourhood, the second of four children. His parents had different cultural backgrounds. His father was a Melkite Catholic of the village of Machrah, near Baskinta in Ain el Qabou. His mother, Odette Ghossein, is Lebanese from the Metn Village of Ain el Kabou, and of Turkish descent. She was born in Egypt and lived there for many years before coming back to Lebanon; she lived in France until her passing in 2021 at the age of 100 years.

Maalouf&#x27;s mother was a staunch Maronite Catholic who insisted on sending him to Collège Notre Dame de Jamhour, a French Jesuit school. He studied sociology at the Francophone Université Saint-Joseph in Beirut.

He is the uncle of trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf.

===Career===

Maalouf worked as the director of &quot;An-Nahar&quot;, a Beirut-based daily newspaper, until the start of the Lebanese civil war in 1975, when he moved to Paris, which became his permanent home. Maalouf&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Crusades Through Arab Eyes&quot; (1983), examines the period based on contemporaneous Arabic sources.

Along with his nonfiction work, he has written four texts for musical compositions and numerous novels.

His book &quot;Un fauteuil sur la Seine&quot; briefly recounts the lives of those who preceded him in seat #29 as a member of the Académie française.

==Awards==
Maalouf has been awarded honorary doctorates by the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), the American University of Beirut (Lebanon), the Rovira i Virgili University (Spain), the University of Évora (Portugal), and the University of Ottawa (Canada).

In 1993, Maalouf was awarded the Prix Goncourt for his novel &quot;The Rock of Tanios&quot; (French: &quot;Le rocher de Tanios)&quot;, set in 19th-century Lebanon. In 2004, the original, French edition of his &quot;Origins: A Memoir&quot; (&quot;Origines&quot;, 2004) won the Prix Méditerranée.

In 2010 he received the Spanish Prince of Asturias Award for Literature for his work, an intense mix of suggestive language, historic affairs in a Mediterranean mosaic of languages, cultures and religions and stories of tolerance and reconciliation. He was elected a member of the Académie française on 23 June 2011 to fill seat 29, left vacant by the death of anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. Maalouf is the first person of Lebanese heritage to receive that honour.

In 2016, he won the Sheikh Zayed Book Award for &quot;Cultural Personality of the Year&quot;, the premier category with a prize of 1 million dirhams (approx. US$272,000). In the same year, the University of Venice Ca&#x27; Foscari awarded him the Bauer-&quot;Incroci di civiltà&quot; prize for fostering cultural dialogue between civilizations. 

In 2020, he was awarded the National Order of Merit by the French government. He was given the honour by President Emmanuel Macron.

In 2021, Maalouf was elected a Royal Society of Literature International Writer.

<text>Vennesla is a municipality in Agder county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Sørlandet. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Vennesla. Other villages in Vennesla include Grovane, Hægeland, Homstean, Mushom, Øvre Eikeland, Øvrebø, Røyknes, and Skarpengland. Vennesla lies about north of the city of Kristiansand in the Otra river valley.

The municipality is the 242nd largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Vennesla is the 79th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 15,294. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 11.2% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==
The parish of Vennesla was established as a municipality in 1864 when it was separated from the larger municipality of Øvrebø. Initially, Vennesla had 1,103 residents. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Vennesla (population: 7,321) was merged with most of the neighboring municipality of Øvrebø (population: 925) and with all of another neighboring municipality, Hægeland (population: 849) which created a new, much larger municipality of Vennesla. On 1 January 1978, a small area of Vennesla (population: 10) was transferred to neighboring Songdalen municipality. Then again on 1 January 1984, the unpopulated Hauglandsvatnet area was transferred from Vennesla to Songdalen municipality. On 1 January 1990, the unpopulated Røssebrekka area, just east of the village of Vennesla was transferred from Kristiansand municipality to Vennesla.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Vennesla&quot; farm () since the first Vennesla Church was built there. The first element is &quot;vendil&quot; which comes from the word which means &quot;small twig&quot;. This may have been an old name for an arm of Venneslafjorden. The last element is which means &quot;swamp&quot; or &quot;shallow water&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was adopted on 15 May 1971. The blazon is &quot;Gules, three barrulets wavy in bend sinister with six tree trunks with branches issuant in chief and two cogwheels in sinister base Or&quot;. This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is three wavy lines diagonally crossing the arms with six trees above the lines and two cogwheels below. The charge has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The three wavy lines symbolises the river Otra, which runs through the municipality. The six trees symbolize the importance of forestry to the local economy. The cogwheels symbolize the local industry. There is a three-pointed mural crown on top of the arms which represent the three municipalities that were merged in 1964 to form the present municipality: Vennesla, Øvrebø, and Hægeland. The arms were designed by Alv Erikstad. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

==Economy==
Vennesla (mostly the village of Vennesla) has a small industrial base, primarily with Hunsfos Fabrikker AS, a paper mill, as the cornerstone of the community. During recent decades, however, the number of employees has drastically declined from around 1,200 in the 1970s, to 200 in 2005 and 120 in 2007. In 2010 there was only 135 employees at the paper mill. 
In 2011, Hunsfos Fabrikker AS celebrated 125 years as a paper mill but later the same year finally ceased production and was declared bankrupt.

During Q4 2022, &quot;one hundred plus&quot; workers at Huntonit, a cornerstone of the community, were scheduled for a temporary Layoff (from work); that&#x27;s a large part of the company&#x27;s work force; there is no fixed schedule for returning to work.

==Media==

==Attractions==
===Vikeland Hovedgård===

Vikeland Hovedgård is a manor house located along the Otra River in the village of Vennesla. Vigeland Manor was completed in 1847. The building was constructed of wood in both Empire and Swiss style. It was built as part of Vigeland Brug, then one of the largest sawmills in the area. Vigeland Manor was built by Caspar Wild who bought the farm and adjacent sawmill in 1833. In 1894, the farm was sold to John Clarke Hawkshaw whose family retained the manor until around 1960. The current annex was built around 1900. During the 1980s, there was restoration with the main building subsequently used as lodging, corporate, and meeting facilities.

The manor house has been said to be haunted by a ghost known as &quot;the Blue Lady&quot; &quot;(den Blå Dama)&quot;. Mari was a farm worker who fell in love with the owner&#x27;s son. They were not allowed to marry, so it is said Mari committed suicide in the &quot;blue room&quot;, hence the title &quot;the Blue Lady&quot;.

===Vennesla Church===

Vennesla Church (&quot;Vennesla Kirke&quot;) serves Vennesla parish in Otredal deanery (&quot;Otredal prosti&quot;). The church was completed in 1829 and consecrated the following year. The church was built of stone and brick, while the west tower with side buildings are wooden. The church replaced a church from the first half of the 1600s. The tower was made higher in 1886, and the interior was restored in 1925.

<text>The Souhegan River is a tributary of the Merrimack River in the northeastern United States. It is long, with a drainage area of , and flows north and east through southern New Hampshire to the Merrimack River. The river begins in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, at the junction of the river&#x27;s South Branch and West Branch. Flowing northeast, it passes through the center of Greenville and descends through a narrow valley to Wilton, where it turns east. The river valley broadens below Wilton, and the river passes through the center of Milford, crosses the southern portion of Amherst, and enters the town of Merrimack. Shortly upstream of the town center, the river passes over Wildcat Falls, then crosses under the Everett Turnpike and U.S. Route 3 to reach the Merrimack River.

The river is used for water supplies, a small amount of hydropower, and recreation. There are 28 threatened or endangered species sharing the watershed with 35,000 people. It is part of the New Hampshire Rivers Management Protection Program.

It was one of two rivers studied by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services to reach data and recommendations about allowable &quot;instream flow&quot;.

== Etymology==
The name &quot;Souhegan&quot; comes from the language of the Native American Algonquins, meaning &quot;waiting and watching place&quot;. Tribal fishermen set weirs across the rapids, and then waited and watched for fish, including salmon, alewives, sturgeon, and eels.

Souhegan High School, which serves the towns of Amherst and Mont Vernon, is named after the river.

The name of Skowhegan, Maine, comes from the same term.

<text>Wardell Gray (February 13, 1921 – May 25, 1955) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
The youngest of four children, Gray was born in Oklahoma City. He spent his early childhood years in Oklahoma before he and his family moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1929.

In early 1935, Gray began attending Northeastern High School, he was then transferred to Cass Technical High School. He left in 1936, before graduating. Advised by his brother-in-law Junior Warren, Gray as a teenager started learning the clarinet. However, after hearing Lester Young on record with Count Basie, he was inspired to switch to the tenor saxophone.

Gray&#x27;s first musical job was in Isaac Goodwin&#x27;s small band, a part-time band that played local dances. When auditioning for another job, he was heard by Dorothy Patton, a young pianist who was forming a band in the Fraternal Club in Flint, Michigan, she later hired him. After a year there, he moved to Jimmy Raschel&#x27;s band (Raschel had recorded a few sides earlier in the 1930s but did not do so again), and then to the Benny Carew band in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Around this time, he met Jeanne Goings; they had a daughter, Anita, born in January 1941.

===With the Earl Hines Orchestra===
Near the Congo Club was the Three Sixes. A young dancer, Jeri Walker, knew Earl Hines, and when the Hines band came through Detroit in late 1943, she persuaded Hines to hire Gray on alto saxophone since there was no tenor saxophone job at the time. This was a break for the 21-year-old, as the Earl Hines Orchestra was not only nationally known but had nurtured the careers of emerging bebop musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. Although most of them had left when Gray joined, playing with the Hines band was a stimulating experience. He married Jeri Walker in Chicago in September 1945.

===Arrival on the West Coast===
He left Hines late in 1946, settling in Los Angeles, California; soon after arriving, he recorded the first session under his name. This was a quartet session for Eddie Laguna&#x27;s Sunset label, and on it Wardell was supported by Dodo Marmarosa on piano. The date produced &quot;Easy Swing&quot; and &quot;The Man I Love&quot;.

In Los Angeles, Wardell worked with Benny Carter, blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, and the small group that supported singer Billy Eckstine on a tour of the West Coast. But the real focus in Los Angeles was in clubs along Central Avenue, which were still thriving after the boom years brought about by the huge injection of wartime defence spending. Here Wardell played in after-hours sessions in clubs such as Jack&#x27;s Basket Room, the Down Beat, Lovejoy&#x27;s, and the Club Alabama. His early success in these sessions led Ross Russell to include him in a studio session he was organizing for his Dial label.

In the Central Avenue clubs Wardell held tenor battles with Dexter Gordon. Gordon recalled, &quot;There&#x27;d be a lot of cats on the stand, but by the end of the session, it would wind up with Wardell and myself...His playing was very fluid, very clean... He had a lot of drive and a profusion of ideas&quot;. Their fame began to spread, and Ross Russell managed to get them to simulate one of their battles on &quot;The Chase&quot;, which became Wardell&#x27;s first nationally known recording and has been called &quot;one of the most exciting musical contests in the history of jazz&quot;.

The success of &quot;The Chase&quot; was the break Wardell needed, and he became increasingly prominent in public sessions in and around Los Angeles, including a series of jam sessions organized by the disc jockey Gene Norman. There were concerts at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, the Shrine Auditorium, and other venues.

===Benny Goodman and Count Basie===
Outside from time spent with a small band led by Al Killian, Wardell was still working mainly in one-off sessions during 1947. However, at a concert around the turn of that year featuring Benny Goodman, Goodman hired him for a small group that he was setting up as part of his flirtation with bebop. Goodman had been critical of bop playing but, speaking of Wardell to &quot;Metronome&quot;, he said that &quot;if he&#x27;s bop, that&#x27;s great. He&#x27;s wonderful!&quot;

Goodman&#x27;s new group included the young Swedish clarinettist Stan Hasselgard and, initially, Teddy Wilson, and it opened at Frank Palumbo&#x27;s Click Club in Philadelphia in May 1948.

The group was not a financial success and Goodman eventually broke it up, but by now Wardell was established on the East Coast as an up-and-coming musician. For a while in late 1948/early 1949 he worked with the Count Basie Orchestra, while also managing to record with Tadd Dameron and in quartet and quintet sessions with Al Haig. The quartet session included &quot;Twisted&quot;, which was used as the basis for a best-selling vocalese version by Annie Ross.

Wardell left Basie in 1949 to return to Benny Goodman. However, life in the Goodman band became increasingly uncongenial for him. In addition, his marriage to Jeri was breaking up. Goodman was not an easy employer at the best of times, and this, combined with the constant traveling, made Wardell increasingly unhappy. The result of this were recordings of the band, both studio sessions, and live airshots, featured work by Wardell that is below his own best standards.

On leaving Goodman, Wardell rejoined Count Basie. Basie had bowed to economic pressures and broken up his big band, forming a septet which included Clark Terry and Buddy DeFranco. Wardell was part of the Basie septet during 1950–51. The only drawback to working with Basie (who had by now enlarged his group again to big band size) was the constant traveling, and Wardell eventually decided to leave so that he could enjoy more home life. The decision was entirely understandable, though the Basie rhythm section was ideally suited to Wardell&#x27;s brand of swing and, from a musical point of view, enthusiasts for his playing may regret his decision. And an unexpected side-effect was that, because work in the LA area was short (for black musicians, anyway) Wardell still had to travel frequently in search of jobs. Nevertheless, life at home was good, and one of the few interviews that he ever gave (to the British &quot;Melody Maker&quot;) showed that he was very happy.

In 1950, Gray played a live concert at the San Francisco Veteran&#x27;s Memorial Hall as a guest with Gerald Wilson&#x27;s band. Remarkably captured in high fidelity stereo (the only such example in his discography), this recording was released for the first time in 2006 . Gray can be heard in fine form during featured solo spots with small combo backup on &quot;Nice Work if You Can Get It&quot; and &quot;Indiana&quot; and also with Wilson&#x27;s big band on the blues &quot;Hollywood Freeway&quot; where Gray trades exciting choruses with Zoot Sims and Stan Getz.

===Decline===
At around this time, his recording sessions started becoming fewer—though a live session with Dexter Gordon, recreating the excitements of Central Avenue, and a studio session with Art Farmer and Hampton Hawes, have fine examples of Gray&#x27;s playing.

However, there are increasing signs of a lack of engagement around 1951/52, notably in a further live session with Dexter Gordon from February 1952, and it seems that he may have been becoming disillusioned with the music business. That he was still capable of playing superbly is shown by his work on a live jam session at The Haig, but such sessions were by now very sparse, and more typical work from this period was recorded on a session with Teddy Charles .

Around this time, Gray became involved with drugs; friends reported that this was taking its toll. His playing was now less fluent, and a studio session in January 1955, which was to be his last, shows strong but (by his own standards) rather unsubtle playing.

===Disappearance and death===
Gray was still working regularly despite his drug problems, and when Benny Carter was engaged in May 1955 to provide the band at the opening of the Moulin Rouge Hotel, he called on Gray. Gray attended rehearsals but was absent when the club opened on May 25. The next day he was found on a stretch of desert on the outskirts of Las Vegas dead with a broken neck. At the age of 34, he died of a heroin overdose.

Although various sources still describe the circumstances of Gray&#x27;s death as mysterious, the closing note of a solography on the tribute website wardellgray.org states that &quot; &#x27;The circumstances are now clear (ref. Han Schulte interviewing Teddy Edwards in the late 80s): Teddy was on the spot, May 1955 in Las Vegas, when WG died in his hotel room after an overdose. His friends, working with the group of Benny Carter in LA, wanted no police trouble, so they put his body in a car and brought it to the desert. By unloading, the body fell on the ground and his neck was broken. That&#x27;s it.&#x27; &quot;

===In popular culture===

James Ellroy&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot; contains a reference to Gray&#x27;s disappearance and death: according to this, he was murdered by (fictional) racist conspirator Wayne Tedrow, Sr. for having an affair with his wife, Janice.

Bill Moody&#x27;s book &quot;Death of a Tenor Man&quot; tells the story of a contemporary investigation of Wardell&#x27;s death by fictional detective/pianist Evan Horne.

Jack Kerouac explicitly references Wardell in his novel &quot;On the Road&quot;:
&quot;They ate voraciously as Neal, sandwich in hand, stood bowed and jumping before the big phonograph listening to a wild bop record I just bought called &#x27;The Hunt&#x27;, with Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray blowing their tops before a screaming audience that gave the record fantastic frenzied volume.&quot;

<doc id="176790" wikidata="Q129372" url="?curid=176790" title="European Capital of Culture">
<text>A European Capital of Culture is a city designated by the European Union (EU) for a period of one calendar year during which it organises a series of cultural events with a strong pan-European dimension. Being a European Capital of Culture can be an opportunity for a city to generate considerable cultural, social, and economic benefits, and it can help foster urban regeneration, change the city&#x27;s image, and raise its visibility and profile on an international scale. Multiple cities can be a European Capital of Culture simultaneously.

In 1985, Melina Mercouri, Greece&#x27;s Minister of Culture, and her French counterpart Jack Lang came up with the idea of designating an annual City of Culture to bring Europeans closer together by highlighting the richness and diversity of European cultures and raising awareness of their common history and values.

The Commission of the European Union manages the title, and each year the Council of Ministers of the European Union formally designates European Capitals of Culture: more than 60 cities have been designated so far. The current European Capitals of Culture for 2025 are Nova Gorica in Slovenia with Gorizia in Italy, and Chemnitz in Germany.

== Selection process ==
An international panel of cultural experts is in charge of assessing the proposals of cities for the title according to criteria specified by the European Union.

For two of the capitals each year, eligibility is open to cities in EU member states only. From 2021 and every three years thereafter, a third capital will be chosen from cities in countries that are candidates or potential candidates for membership, or in countries that are part of the European Economic Area (EEA)– an example of the latter being Stavanger, Norway, which was a European Capital of Culture in 2008.

A 2004 study conducted for the Commission, known as the &quot;Palmer report&quot;, demonstrated that the choice of European Capital of Culture served as a catalyst for cultural development and the transformation of the city. Consequently, the beneficial socio-economic development and impact for the chosen city are now also considered in determining the chosen cities.

Bids from five United Kingdom cities to be the 2023 Capital of Culture were disqualified in November 2017, because the UK was planning to leave the EU before 2023.

== History ==
The European Capital of Culture programme was initially called the European City of Culture and was conceived in 1983, by Melina Mercouri, then serving as minister of culture in Greece. Mercouri believed that at the time, culture was not given the same attention as politics and economics and a project for promoting European cultures within the member states should be pursued. 

The European City of Culture programme was launched in the summer of 1985 with Athens being the first title-holder. In 1999, the European City of Culture program was renamed to European Capital of Culture.

== List of European Capitals of Culture ==

1 The European Capital of Culture was due to be in the UK in 2023. However, due to its decision to leave the European Union, UK cities would no longer be eligible to hold the title after 2019. The European Commission&#x27;s Scotland office confirmed that this would be the case on 23 November 2017, only one week before the UK was due to announce which city would be put forward. The candidate cities were Dundee, Leeds, Milton Keynes, Nottingham and a joint bid from Northern Irish cities of Belfast and Derry and the town of Strabane.

2 A new framework makes it possible for cities in candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine), potential candidates for EU membership (Kosovo) or EFTA member states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland) to hold the title every third year as of 2021. This will be selected through an open competition, meaning that cities from various countries may compete with each other.

<text>Dario Luigi Angelo Fo (; 24 March 1926 – 13 October 2016) was an Italian playwright, actor, theatre director, stage designer, songwriter, political campaigner for the Italian left wing and the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature. In his time he was &quot;arguably the most widely performed contemporary playwright in world theatre&quot;. Much of his dramatic work depends on improvisation and comprises the recovery of &quot;illegitimate&quot; forms of theatre, such as those performed by &quot;giullari&quot; (medieval strolling players) and, more famously, the ancient Italian style of &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;.

His plays have been translated into 30 languages and performed across the world, including in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, India, Iran, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. His work of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s is peppered with criticisms of assassinations, corruption, organised crime, racism, Roman Catholic theology, and war. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he took to lampooning Forza Italia and its leader Silvio Berlusconi, while his targets of the 2010s included the banks amid the European sovereign-debt crisis. Also in the 2010s, he became the main ideologue of the Five Star Movement, the anti-establishment party led by Beppe Grillo, often referred to by its members as &quot;the Master&quot;.

Fo&#x27;s solo &quot;pièce célèbre&quot;, titled &quot;Mistero Buffo&quot; and performed across Europe, Asia, Canada and Latin America over a 30-year period, is recognised as one of the most controversial and popular spectacles in postwar European theatre and has been denounced by Cardinal Ugo Poletti, Cardinal Vicar for the Diocese of Rome, as &quot;the most blasphemous show in the history of television&quot;. The title of the original English translation of &quot;Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!&quot; (&quot;Can&#x27;t Pay? Won&#x27;t Pay!&quot;) has passed into the English language, and the play is described as capturing &quot;something universal in actions and reactions of the working class&quot;.

His receipt of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature marked the &quot;international acknowledgment of Fo as a major figure in twentieth-century world theatre&quot;. The Swedish Academy praised Fo as a writer &quot;who emulates the jesters of the Middle Ages in scourging authority and upholding the dignity of the downtrodden&quot;. He owned and operated a theatre company. Fo was an atheist.

==Early life and education==
An eldest child, Fo was born at Leggiuno, Sangiano, in Lombardy&#x27;s Province of Varese, near the eastern shore of Lake Maggiore. His younger brother Fulvio would become a theatre administrator, their younger sister Bianca Fo Garambois, a writer. Their mother, Pina Rota Fo, from a peasant background, wrote a book of reminiscences of the area between the wars, &quot;Il paese delle rane&quot; (&quot;Land of Frogs&quot;, 1978). Their father, Felice, was a station master for the Italian state railway, and the family frequently moved along the Swiss border when Felice was transferred to new postings. Felice, a socialist, was also an actor, appearing for an amateur theatre company in works by Ibsen among others. Fo learned storytelling from his maternal grandfather and Lombard fishers and glassblowers. Among the places in which Fo lived during his early years was Porto Valtravaglia, a glassblowing colony in which, it has been claimed, resided the highest percentage of insane people in Italy.

In 1942, Fo moved to Milan to study at the Academy Brera Academy. However, the Second World War intervened. At age 16, Fo was part of the last generation of soldiers drafted by the fascist army of Mussolini&#x27;s Repubblica Sociale Italiana. Years later, when questioned about his affiliation, Fo explained that he initially opted to adopt a low profile because his family was active in the anti-fascist Resistance. Fo secretly helped his father to smuggle refugees and Allied soldiers to Switzerland by disguising them as Lombard peasants. His father is also thought to have helped smuggle Jewish scientists to the safety of Switzerland. As the end of the war approached, Fo joined an anti-aircraft division of the navy, anticipating an immediate discharge due to a shortage of munitions. He was mistaken and was instead dispatched to a camp in Monza at which Benito Mussolini himself arrived. Fo soon deserted with the aid of false documents and wandered for a while before joining a parachute squadron. He then deserted this as well, prompting a further unsuccessful search for the Resistance movement during which he slept rough in the countryside.

After the war Fo returned to the Brera Academy, also taking up architectural studies at the Politecnico di Milano. He started a thesis on Roman architecture, but becoming disillusioned by the cheap impersonal work expected of architects after the war, he left his studies before his final examinations. He had a nervous breakdown; a doctor told him to spend time doing that which brought him joy. He began to paint and became involved in the &quot;piccoli teatri&quot; (small theatres) movement, in which he began to present improvised monologues.

He considered his artistic influences to include Beolco, Brecht, Chekhov, De Filippo, Gramsci, Mayakovsky, Molière, Shaw and Strehler.

==Career==

===1950s===
In 1950, Fo asked to work with Franco Parenti on a variety show performed by radio actors, beginning a collaboration that would last until 1954. Fo delighted audiences with stories of his upbringing, which Parenti was very impressed by, describing them as &quot;absolutely original, with an extraordinary humour, wit and personification. When the show was over we&#x27;d go for walks round the lake and he&#x27;d tell me more stories. In this way we originated a project in which we would work together on a new type of revue, one which didn&#x27;t copy reality, but which involved people and took a stand.&quot;

In late 1951, after Fo had gained experience with Parenti, Italian national radio station RAI invited Fo to perform a solo Saturday evening comedy series &quot;Poer nano&quot; (&quot;Poor thing&quot;), airing after Parenti&#x27;s &quot;Anacleto the Gas Man&quot;. Fo created 18 adult fairy tale monologues adapted from biblical and historical tales. The series also featured Shakespearean tales with various twists, such as a version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in which the titular character kills his father to continue an affair with his mother; Ophelia is portrayed as Hamlet&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s trans mistress, while Horatio plays the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father dressed up as a sheet and only appears when Hamlet is drunk. The series also featured an albino Othello and a sadistic Juliet who keeps Romeo in her garden with savage dogs. Scandalised authorities cancelled the show. Nevertheless, Fo performed it on stage at the Teatro Odeon in Milan in 1952, which allowed him to develop the gesture and action not required for radio. Also in 1952, Fo performed &quot;Cocoricò&quot; with Giustino Durano, which featured a 20-minute sketch focusing on the plight of black people in the United States.
In 1953, Fo—in collaboration with Parenti and Durano in their own revue company which they called I Dritti (The Stand-ups)—co-wrote, co-directed and designed the sets and costumes for a revue called &quot;Il dito nell&#x27;occhio&quot; (&quot;A finger in the eye&quot;). In these early years, Fo has been influenced by the Italian tradition of the actor-author, just like Ettore Petrolini. The title of his first revue referred to that of a column in the Italian Communist Party (PCI) newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot;. &quot;Il dito nell&#x27;occhio&quot; consisted of 21 sketches similar in style to &quot;Poer nano&quot; but dealing instead with a satirical history of the world. The last performance, in which Fo played a supporting role, was a box-office success and went on tour after 113 performances at Milan&#x27;s Piccolo Teatro. 1953 also brought the beginning of Fo&#x27;s songwriting. He collaborated with Fiorenzo Carpi; all of Fo&#x27;s plays as far as 1967 would feature Carpi&#x27;s music. &quot;La luna è una lampadina&quot; (&quot;The moon is a lightbulb&quot;), their first song, is one of Fo&#x27;s most famous.

Fo met Franca Rame, daughter of a theatrical family, when they were working in the revue &quot;Sette giorni a Milano&quot;. They became engaged, and married on 24 June 1954. They had a son, Jacopo (born 31 March 1955), who would also become a writer.

With the break-up of I dritti due to financial failure, Fo and family moved to Rome where he hoped to gain work as a screenwriter in the cinema. There they lived next door to Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman. Fo worked on many productions, including those of Dino De Laurentiis. Rame worked in Teatro Stabile of Bolzano. In 1956, Fo co-wrote and acted with Rame in the Carlo Lizzani&#x27;s film &quot;Lo svitato&quot; (&quot;The screwball&quot;), influenced by Jacques Tati, Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. In the film, Fo plays &quot;a disoriented hotel porter cast adrift in a neo-capitalist Milan of skyscrapers and modern technology&quot;. Other films followed.

In 1958, the couple returned to Milan when Rame was offered roles in a series of farces at the Arlecchino Theatre. Fo and Rame were subsequently based there. Fo said, &quot;For me the lesson of the cinema meant learning from a technical point of view what audiences had already grasped: a story divided into sequences, a fast pace, sharp dialogue, and getting rid of the conventions of space and time. Working on screenplays gave me an apprenticeship as a playwright and I was able to transfer the lessons of the new technical means to the theatre&quot;.

The foundation of the Compagnia Fo-Rame dates from this time. Fo wrote scripts, acted, directed, and designed costumes and stage paraphernalia. Rame took care of the administration. The company débuted at the Piccolo Teatro, and in 1959 began a series of six full-length plays that were performed each season at the Teatro Odeon. One of these, &quot;Gli arcangeli non giocano al flipper&quot; (&quot;Archangels Don&#x27;t Play Pinball&quot;), brought Fo and Rame national and, later, international recognition. It would be the first Fo play to be performed outside Italy—in Yugoslavia, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Spain. Other successes would follow.

===1960s===
In 1962, Fo wrote and directed a variety show, &quot;Canzonissima&quot;, for RAI. Fo used the show to give Italians a glimpse of a type of television resembling the origins of theatre, far removed from the &quot;junk TV&quot; previously produced by the company. &quot;Canzonissima&quot; featured satirical songs and sketches depicting the lives of the working classes. However, it was frequently censored. One sketch featured a fat aunt who came to visit her nephew at his workplace (a canned meat factory) only to fall into a machine and come out as mincemeat, which the nephew retained in a cupboard at home and often displayed to friends: this led to complaints from canned meat producers and &quot;industrialists in general&quot;—though none from aunts, Fo later observed. Nonetheless &quot;Canzonissima&quot; proved popular, attracting millions of viewers, and Rame maintained that taxi drivers in Italian cities would often say they had no work during broadcasts as everyone was watching it.

The show&#x27;s eighth episode—which referenced the dangerous conditions faced by workers on building sites—led to a dispute with the programme&#x27;s producers, and prompted Fo and Rame to walk out on 29 November 1962. RAI maintained it would not broadcast the sketch as it risked further inflaming the annoyance of building workers&#x27; unions at working conditions. National uproar ensued over this censorship, with headlines in the daily newspapers and questions in the Italian parliament. RAI sued Fo and Rame and destroyed all the &quot;Canzonissima&quot; recordings. The dispute led to the effective banning of Fo and Rame from Italian television for 14 years.
Fo returned to Milan&#x27;s Teatro Odeon with the play &quot;Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe&quot; (&quot;Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man&quot;), considered &quot;an attempt to demystify and debunk the traditional history-book image&quot; of Christopher Columbus. Fo said: &quot;I wanted to attack those Italian intellectuals who, with the centre-left and the Socialist Party in the government, had discovered power and its advantages and leapt on it like rats on a piece of cheese. I wanted to dismantle a character who had been embalmed as a hero in school history books, whereas he is in fact an intellectual who tries to keep afloat within the mechanisms of power, play games with the King and be cunning with power figures, only to end up reduced to a wretch.&quot; Fo received threatening letters, was assaulted in Rome with Rame by fascist groups who also threw rubbish at them, while another performance was disrupted by a bomb scare. He later recounted this event in the prologue of &quot;Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas&quot;.

&quot;La signora è da buttare&quot; (&quot;Throw the Lady Out&quot;) was the final play Fo put on in the mainstream establishment Italian theatre. Performed in 1967, it contained topical references to the Vietnam War, Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The play prompted the first English-language piece of criticism on Fo&#x27;s work by U.S. critic A. Richard Sogliuzzo in 1972. He interpreted the titular lady as &quot;representing American capitalism [... and who just before her death] was elevated above a sink in a Statue of Liberty pose, and then ascended to a heaven packed with consumer goods&quot;. The U.S. government would later consistently deny Fo entry under the now-defunct McCarran-Walter Act.

Inspired by the events of May 1968 in France, Fo and Rame abandoned the official state theatre in Italy and set up Associazione Nuova Scena, a theatre collective operating outside the state structure. They asked the PCI for assistance and access to community centres and workers&#x27; clubs. In October 1968, they toured Fo&#x27;s latest play &quot;Grande pantomima con bandiere e pupazzi piccoli e medi&quot; (&quot;Grand Pantomime with Flags and Small and Middle-sized Puppets&quot;), opening in Cesena. The play, which featured masks instead of characters—representing Capital, the Confederation of Industry, High Finance, the Church, the People, Rebels and Peasants—included a giant puppet representing fascism which gave birth to representatives of the Church, the Monarchy, the Army and Industrialism. &quot;L&#x27;operaio conosce 300 parole, il padrone 1,000: per questo lui è il padrone&quot; (&quot;The Worker Knows 300 Words, the Boss Knows 1000, That&#x27;s Why He&#x27;s the Boss&quot;), &quot;Legami pure che tanto io spacco tutto lo stesso&quot; (&quot;Chain Me Up and I&#x27;ll Still Smash Everything&quot;) and &quot;Mistero Buffo&quot; (&quot;Comical Mystery Play&quot;), also date from this time. Though Fo himself had never been a Communist Party member, his open criticism of PCI methods and policies on the stage led to conflict with the Party.

===1970s===
In 1970, Fo and Rame began their third theatre group, &quot;Collettivo Teatrale &quot;La Comune&quot;&quot; with the musician Paolo Ciarchi and the administrator Nanni Ricordi. They based themselves at an abandoned workshop (&quot;capannone&quot;) in via Colletta in a working-class suburb of Milan for three years, converting it into a sort of community centre and producing plays based on improvisation about contemporary issues. One such play was &quot;Vorrei morire stasera se dovessi pensare che non è servito a niente&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;d Rather Die Tonight If I Had To Think It Had All Been In Vain&quot;). Inspired by the Black September, with the title derived from a Renata Viganò poem, thousands of people came to see it.
What followed was &quot;Morte accidentale di un anarchico&quot; (&quot;Accidental Death of an Anarchist&quot;), Fo&#x27;s most internationally recognised play, described by the playwright as &quot;a grotesque farce about a tragic farce&quot;. It opened in December 1970, Fo having written it after right-wing extremists and the Italian Secret Service carried out a &quot;terrorist&quot; attack on the Banca Nazionale dell&#x27;Agricoltura in Piazza Fontana in Milan in 1969. (See: Strategy of tension.) This farce subsequently toured Italy with &quot;Tutti uniti! Tutti insieme! Ma scusa, quello non è il padrone?&quot; (&quot;United We Stand! All Together Now! Oops, Isn&#x27;t That the Boss?&quot;), considered by Rame to be Fo&#x27;s best work apart from &quot;Morte accidentale&quot; and &quot;Mistero buffo&quot;. &quot;Morte e resurezione di un pupazzo&quot; (&quot;Death and Resurrection of a Puppet&quot;) was an updated version of &quot;Grande pantomima&quot;. &quot;Fedayn&quot;, first performed in January 1972, it consists of a series of autobiographical accounts from Palestine.

In March 1973, five fascists, commissioned—according to some rumors—by high-ranking officials in Milan&#x27;s Carabinieri, abducted Rame, held her at gunpoint and dumped her in a van. They raped her, beat her, burnt her with cigarettes, slashed her with razor blades and left her in a park. Fo and Rame continued to tour around Lombardy and Veneto throughout that year, despite a split in &quot;La Comune&quot;; the short piece &quot;Mamma Togni&quot; dates from this time.

In September 1973, after the suicide of Salvador Allende in Chile, &quot;Guerra di popolo in Cile&quot; (&quot;The People&#x27;s War in Chile&quot;) was produced, and toured the country attracting great interest. This was particularly due to a part at the end that unnerved audiences, who thought a coup had been declared across Italy. According to Chiara Valentini, a member of the audience panicked during a performance in Turin and ate ten pages of what he thought might be compromising names, while in Merano a student broke the glass in an attempt to flee through a window. The actual police arrested Fo in Sassari in November 1973, leading to nationwide uproar when it emerged that under Italian law the police could not enter the theatre during the performance; the outcry served only to boost attendances at future performances.
In 1974, the company—which had now become &quot;Il Collettivo Teatrale &quot;La Comune&quot; diretto da Dario Fo&quot;—occupied and cleaned up an abandoned market building in Porta Vittoria (a working-class area of Milan) and dubbed it the Palazzina Liberty. Political enmities intervened however, and Milan&#x27;s council tried to remove them by court order. The council was unsuccessful; the company was allowed to stay temporarily and set about developing facilities such as a library, conference centre, theatre and audiovisual workshops. They began performing with &quot;Porta e Belli contro il potere&quot; (&quot;Porta and Belli Against the Authorities&quot;), in which Fo read sonnets by the two titular 19th-century poets, described by him as &quot;splendid texts, and when I recited them individually they worked marvellously, but not altogether in the same show.&quot;

Next came the farce, &quot;Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!&quot; (&quot;Can&#x27;t Pay? Won&#x27;t Pay!&quot;), documenting the &quot;autoriduzione&quot; (self-reduction) movement which had developed during the severe economic crisis Italy was experiencing, and in which people would take what they wished from markets, only paying for what they could afford. Regarded as Fo&#x27;s best-known play internationally after &quot;Morte accidentale di un anarchico&quot;, it had been performed in 35 countries by 1990. The title &quot;Can&#x27;t Pay? Won&#x27;t Pay!&quot; has also passed into the English language.

To the backdrop of the June 1975 Italian elections, Fo wrote &quot;Il Fanfani rapito&quot; (&quot;Fanfani Kidnapped&quot;)—a reference to Amintore Fanfani. Also in June 1975, Fo, Rame and other members of the company went to China—Fo later used his recollections of the trip in the monologue &quot;La storia della tigre&quot; (&quot;The Tale of a Tiger&quot;), with which he toured around Italy in 1978.

The same year (1975) Fo was nominated for the Nobel Prize for the first time. He thought the idea absurd: &quot;I have become famous for my aversion to figures of reverence and genuflections of any kind. This Nobel business is a real comedy. I can imagine the look on the faces of certain state officials, magistrates and politicians I know. They take great pains to shut me up and clap me in handcuffs, and the Swedes go and play a trick like this ... [Receiving the prize] would be like acting in one of my plays.&quot;

Fo next turned to Italy&#x27;s growing drug problem, summing it up as follows: &quot;Rich people consume and use drugs, while poor people are used and consumed by drugs.&quot; &quot;La marijuana della mamma è la più bella&quot; (&quot;&quot;) features a character called Grandpa who mistakenly swallows LSD instead of aspirin and hallucinates a farcical tram journey in his wardrobe ending at a police station. Fiorenzo Carpi returned to collaborate with Fo on the play&#x27;s music, the first time they had worked together since 1967.

Fo returned to television in 1977 after 14 years off the air, RAI&#x27;s administration having been changed following the previous year&#x27;s general election. Fo was, however, limited to Rai 2, the second channel, which had a more socialist and non-religious slant than the more conservative Rai 1. Two cycles of his plays were broadcast; for political reasons these did not include &quot;Morte accidentale di un anarchico&quot;, &quot;Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!&quot; or &quot;Il Fanfani rapito&quot; (although La Commune filmed them to have a permanent record of them). The Vatican still denounced &quot;Mistero buffo&quot; as &quot;the most blasphemous show in the history of television&quot;. A new play for the TV series, &quot;Parliamo di donne&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Women&quot;), focused on topics such as abortion, sexism and the Holy Family.

A series of five monologues collectively titled &quot;Tutta casa, letto e chiesa&quot; (&quot;All House, Bed and Church&quot;) also first appeared in 1977, and were performed by Rame. The first, &quot;Il risveglio&quot; (&quot;Waking Up&quot;), featured a working-class mother talking to her baby (a doll). &quot;Una donna tutta sola&quot; (&quot;A Woman Alone&quot;) was about a housewife locked indoors by her husband who had to deal with a crying baby while fighting off the advances of his disabled, wheelchair-using, pornographic-film-obsessed brother, a man with a telescope, an obscene telephone caller and a former teacher who has fallen in love with her. &quot;La mamma fricchettona&quot; (&quot;Freak Mother&quot;) featured a mother taking shelter in a church confessional after leaving her family to pursue drugs and free love. &quot;The Same Old Story&quot; features a little girl with a doll who swears. The final monologue, &quot;Medea&quot;, based on an Italian version rather than the more famous Euripides version, had been performed in 35 countries by 1990.

===1980s===

In 1980, the United States authorities blocked Fo and Rame from performing at the country&#x27;s Festival of Italian Theatre, an act which has been compared with the country&#x27;s similar treatment of Bertolt Brecht, Charlie Chaplin and Gabriel García Márquez. In May that year, &quot;An Evening Without Dario Fo and Franca Rame&quot;, held in New York, was attended by Arthur Miller, Bernard Malamud, Richard Foreman and Martin Scorsese. The event featured a reading in English of the first act of &quot;Non Si Paga! Non Si Paga!&quot; and a letter (read by Piero Sciotto) written by Fo and Rame. The American Theatre Critics Association sent a letter to the politician, Edmund Muskie. In December 1980, Fo was on stage in France for his own show untitled &quot;Histoire du tigre et autres histoires&quot; (Tiger Story &amp; other stories).

In 1981, with La Commune having been evicted from the Palazzina Liberty, a second version of &quot;Tutta casa, letto e chiesa&quot; opened at the Teatro Odeon, the first time in 16 years that Fo and Rame performed there. Also that year (January) &quot;Clacson, trombette e pernacchi&quot; (&quot;Trumpets and Raspberries&quot;) was first performed at Milan&#x27;s Cinema Cristallo, and was Fo&#x27;s first new play since &quot;La marijuana della mamma è la più bella&quot; five years previously. 50,000 people saw it performed 34 times in Milan, and it had soon been produced in 15 other countries.

In 1983, Italian censors restricted &quot;Coppia aperta, quasi spalancata&quot; (&quot;The Open Couple&quot;) to audiences over the age of 18 when Rame included as a prologue her monologue &quot;The Rape&quot; (inspired by her own rape). &quot;Il candelaio&quot; (&quot;The Candlestickmaker&quot;), a monologue written by Fo in 1983, displayed Fo&#x27;s increased interest in the English Elizabethan Theatre, and preceded &quot;Quasi per caso una donna: Elisabetta&quot; (&quot;&quot;), which Fo and Rame began work on in late 1984.

In September 1983, the U.S. authorities again refused Fo and Rame permission to enter the nation, and, to Fo&#x27;s bewilderment, accused them of &quot;belonging to organisations supporting terrorist groups.&quot; At this time Fo was the foreign writer whose plays were most widely produced in the United States. Famed producer Joseph Papp sent a telegram in their behalf to U.S. President Ronald Reagan, himself a former actor, but to no avail. Fo and Rame began a lawsuit against the U.S. State Department, pledging any damages received to sacked workers and occupied workplaces, the disabled, families of prisoners and other favorite causes.

Fo called a press conference in Milan to explain the grave offence U.S. authorities had caused himself and his wife: &quot;We are Italian citizens who are supposed to have committed the crime of aiding and abetting terrorists in Italy. The Italian judicial authorities, however have never charged us or even made inquiries [...] nor have they accused us of any support of terrorism: in any case our position on the subject is well known. Now the Americans arrive on the scene and decide that we support terrorists, which means either that the Italian judicial authorities aren&#x27;t doing their job or that they are in complicity with us.&quot;

1985 brought &quot;Hellequin, Harlekin, Arlecchino&quot;—based on Harlequin. 1986 brought &quot;&quot;, in which bankrupt banker Francesca Bollini de Rill has herself kidnapped to divert from her imminent arrest—adapted as &quot;Abducting Diana&quot; in 1994 by Stephen Stenning for English audiences. Appointed Professor of Drama at the University of Rome, the seminars Fo conducted there included ones on; Harlequin and the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;.
The pre-Christmas 1987 performance of &quot;The First Miracle of the Infant Jesus&quot; on Italian television&#x27;s variety-lottery show &quot;Fantastico&quot; led to further accusations of blasphemy from the Vatican; Fo portrayed the titular character deploying bolts of lightning to save other children from a bully. For the first time in 26 years, in April and May 1988, Fo and Rame collaborated on an original project, &quot;Transmissione forzata&quot; (&quot;Forced Transmission&quot;) on Italian television. Restricted to Rai 3, the series featured ironic songs about RAI censorship and Italian politicians, dancing girls and satirical news bulletins, a ballet on Palestine and a &quot;weather report&quot; on national rape statistics. Also in 1988, Fo returned to film acting for the first time since 1958, playing a retired professor in &quot;Musica per vecchi animali&quot; (&quot;Music for Old Animals&quot;).

In 1989, in solidarity with those affected by the Tiananmen Square Massacre, Fo updated &quot;La storia della tigre&quot; and wrote two monologues &quot;Lettera dalla Cina&quot; (&quot;Letter from China&quot;) and &quot;The Story of Qu&quot;. The same year, Fo also wrote &quot;Il ricercato&quot; (&quot;The Wanted Man&quot;), an unperformed play about the mafia, and &quot;Il Papa e la strega&quot; (&quot;The Pope and the Witch&quot;), which debuted in late October. The latter portrayed a Pope overcome both by a phobia of being attacked by children and by an attack of arthritis which leaves his arms raised in blessing, and who, acting upon the advice of a woman disguised as a nun and claiming to be a witch, swings from a chandelier and injects himself with heroin during his search for a cure, and avoids various assassination attempts involving a toy car, poisoned parrot and Brazilian nun. Critics praised its comic inventiveness and it won an award for being the play seen by most people in Italy that season.

===1990s===
Addressing themes such as AIDS, the Gulf War and genetic experiments, Fo wrote &quot;Zitti! Stiamo precipitando!&quot; (&quot;Hush! We&#x27;re Falling!&quot;) in summer 1990, and it debuted at Milan&#x27;s Teatro Nuovo that November. The titular character of &quot;Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas&quot;, Fo&#x27;s response to the 1992 quincentennial celebrations of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the Americas, is a Venetian fugitive who escapes from the Spanish Inquisition by joining the explorer and coloniser&#x27;s fourth voyage. Forced to tend the animals on board, a storm casts him adrift in the ocean on the back of a pig until he reaches the coast and is rescued by the indigenous peoples of the Americas. A video recording of Fo&#x27;s performance exists.

1993 brought an important anniversary of Carlo Goldoni; Fo, who was unimpressed, and, choosing instead to focus his attention on Angelo Beolco, planned a joint production between his company and Teatro dei Incamminati, a publicly funded company. However, with rehearsals well underway, a ministerial letter arrived to block the project&#x27;s completion with &quot;an obscure law forbidding co-productions between public and private companies.&quot;

Fo and Rame collaborated on the monologue &quot;Settimo: ruba un po&#x27; meno no. 2&quot; (&quot;Seventh Commandment: Steal a Bit Less No. 2&quot;), inspired by the corruption scandals (Tangentopoli) which were rife in Italy during the 1990s. They later performed &quot;Mamma! I sanculotti!&quot; (&quot;Mummy! The Sans-culottes!&quot;), set in the eighteenth century but also making references to the Tangentopoli, and featuring music again by Fiorenzo Carpi.

For the 1994 monologue &quot;Sesso? Grazie, tanto per gradire!&quot; (&quot;Sex? Thanks, Don&#x27;t Mind If I Do!&quot;), Fo and Rame worked with their son Jacopo to produce a performance based on Jacopo&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;Lo Zen e l&#x27;arte di scopare&quot; (&quot;Zen and the Art of Fucking&quot;), featuring educational pieces on topics such as AIDS, contraception, sex education and sexual repression. Thus came Fo&#x27;s first run-in with the new government of Silvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi&#x27;s government banned Italians under the age of 18 from seeing it over fears, it said, that the play could &quot;cause offence to the common decency which requires respect for spheres of decency, and provoke distress among adolescent spectators, with possible effects on their behaviour in relation to sex&quot;, thus defeating the original purpose of the performance. Much free publicity ensued, with the censorship issue being debated in the national parliament, teachers calling for it to be performed, and audiences and both Italian and foreign intellectuals signing a petition calling for the ban to be overturned.

On 17 July 1995, Fo had a stroke. He quickly recovered and was well again by his seventieth birthday on 24 March 1996. In summer 1996, he wrote &quot;&quot;. Set in 1502, the titular character of the play was Leonardo da Vinci. In 1997, he wrote &quot;Il diavolo con le zinne&quot; (&quot;The Devil with Boobs&quot;). Described by Fo as &quot;a Machiavellian comedy, a gigantic late sixteenth-century intrigue, with judges and devils, housekeepers possessed by devils, hermits, gendarmes, torturers and even a monkey&quot;, it featured an homage to Fiorenzo Carpi who had died earlier that year.

===21st century===

In 2001, Fo became Satrap of the Collège de ‘Pataphysique. In 2004, Forza Italia senator Marcello Dell&#x27;Utri, on trial at the time for money laundering, sued Fo over references to him in his latest play. Fo was disgusted: &quot;I have been doing satire for 40 years. It is paradox. It is grotesque.&quot; The play, titled &quot;The Two-Headed Anomaly&quot; and first performed in 2003, also poked fun at the shortness of then prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, had him strapped to a chair and given electric shock treatment and portrayed Vladimir Putin being shot dead by Chechen rebels while visiting Berlusconi&#x27;s luxury villa in Sicily. The title refers to the subsequent transplanting of Putin&#x27;s brain into Berlusconi&#x27;s head, and the play was performed amid debate over Berlusconi&#x27;s business and political interests and media censorship, with RAI having barred Italian satirists Sabina Guzzanti and Paolo Rossi from its television channels. Fo spoke of receiving threats from politicians if he performed it.
In 2005, Fo revealed plans to run for Mayor of Milan, the most economically important city in Italy, the following year. He said it was part of his ongoing fight to rid Milan of Berlusconi&#x27;s political colleague Gabriele Albertini, the incumbent mayor. Ostracised by Italian television (both state—RAI having shunted his latest show off to a graveyard slot—and commercial—three quarters owned by Fo&#x27;s long-time adversary Berlusconi), Fo instead elected to campaign on stage. Under the slogan &quot;I am not a moderate&quot;, he opposed the centre-right administration&#x27;s plans to demolish parts of the city centre and vowed to chase out those &quot;money-grabbing bastards who have run this city for decades&quot;. Securing 23.4% of the vote in the primary election of centre-left The Union in January 2006, he was ultimately unsuccessful, finishing second to Milan&#x27;s former police chief Bruno Ferrante.

Throughout the early 21st century until his death in 2016, Fo remained an active participant and campaigner on various political, social and cultural issues. He questioned the official accounts of the September 11 attacks and the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings in the film, &quot;Zero: An Investigation into 9/11&quot;. In 2008, he was among the signatories of an open letter to &quot;la Repubblica&quot; which called on the state to protect Roberto Saviano, whose life was under threat after exposing the clandestine activities of the Camorra in his 2006 book &quot;Gomorrah&quot;. Ahead of the 2013 Italian general election, Fo explained that the most recent targets of his satire included: &quot;The banks mostly, and the big entrepreneurs. All those who hold the reins of &#x27;the show within a show&#x27;, i.e. those who – through the media, television and in other ways – make every effort to ensure that the people accept the conditions they find themselves in.&quot;

===Death===
On 13 October 2016 Fo died at the age of 90 due to a serious respiratory disease which had previously forced him to recover for 12 days in the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan.

<text>Sunil Manohar &quot;Sunny&quot; Gavaskar (Marathi pronunciation: ; born 10 July 1949), is a former captain of the Indian national cricket team who represented India and Mumbai from 1971 to 1987. Gavaskar is acknowledged as one of the greatest opening batsmen of all time.

Gavaskar was widely admired for his technique against fast bowling, with a particularly high average of 65.45 against the West Indies, who possessed a four-pronged fast bowling attack, widely regarded as the most vicious in Test history. However, most of Gavaskar&#x27;s centuries against West Indies were against the team when their four-pronged attack were not playing together. His captaincy of the Indian team, was considered as one of the first attacking ones, with Indian team winning the 1984 Asia Cup, and the World Championship of Cricket in 1985. At the same time, there were multiple exchanges of captaincy between Gavaskar and Kapil Dev, with one coming just six months before Kapil led India to victory at the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He is also a former Sheriff of Mumbai.

Gavaskar is a recipient of the Indian sports honour of the Arjuna Award and the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan. He was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2012, he was awarded the C. K. Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award, the highest honour BCCI can bestow on a former player. Gavaskar is also known as Sunny by his fans and fellow cricket commentators.

== Domestic debut ==
Born in Mumbai in a middle class Marathi Family and a student of St Xavier&#x27;s High School young Sunil Gavaskar was named &quot;India&#x27;s Best Schoolboy Cricketer of the year&quot; in 1966 while playing for his school. He scored 246*, 222 and 85 in school cricket in his final year of secondary education before striking a century against the touring London schoolboys. He made his first-class debut for Vazir Sultan Colts XI against an XI from Dungarpur in 1966–67 but remained in Bombay&#x27;s Ranji Trophy squad for the next two years without playing a match. An alumnus of Bombay&#x27;s St. Xavier&#x27;s College, he made his debut in the 1968–69 season against Karnataka but made a duck and was the subject of derisive claims that his selection was due to the presence of his uncle Madhav Mantri, a former Indian Test wicket keeper on Bombay&#x27;s selection committee. He responded with 114 against Rajasthan in his second match and two other consecutive centuries saw him being selected in the 1970–71 Indian team to tour the West Indies.

== Test debut ==

=== First test match win in West Indies ===
After missing the first Test due to nail infection, Gavaskar scored 65 and 67 not out in the second Test in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, hitting the winning runs which gave India its first-ever win over the West Indies.

=== First Test century and first series victory over West Indies ===
He followed this with his first century, 116 and 64* in the third Test in Georgetown, Guyana, and 1 and 117* in the Fourth Test in Bridgetown, Barbados. He returned to Trinidad for the fifth Test and scored 124 and 220 to help India to its first ever series victory over the West Indies, and the only one until 2006. His performance in the Test made him the second player after Doug Walters to score a century and double century in the same match and remains the only Indian until date to achieve this feat. He also became the first Indian to make four centuries in one Test series, the second Indian after Vijay Hazare to score two centuries in the same Test, and the third after Hazare and Polly Umrigar to score centuries in three consecutive innings. He was the first Indian to aggregate more than 700 runs in a series and until date remains the only Indian to do so. This 774 runs at 154.80 also remains the most runs scored in a debut series by any batsman. Trinidad Calypso singer Lord Relator (Willard Harris) wrote a song in Gavaskar&#x27;s honour, the &quot;Gavaskar Calypso&quot;.

=== England tour ===
Gavaskar&#x27;s arrival in England in 1971 for a three-Test series generated substantial publicity in light of his debut series. He was unable to maintain his performance, making only two half-centuries. He was involved in controversy when taking a quick single from the bowling of John Snow. They collided, and Gavaskar fell over. Snow was charged with deliberately barging into Gavaskar and was suspended. Gavaskar&#x27;s 144 runs at the low average of 24, led some to question Gavaskar&#x27;s worthiness for international cricket.

=== England tour of India ===
In 1972–73, England toured India for a five-Test series, Gavaskar&#x27;s first on home soil. He was ineffective in the first three Tests, accumulating only sixty runs in five innings as India took a 2–1 lead. He scored some runs in the final two Tests which India drew to complete consecutive series wins over England. His first home series was largely disappointing, aggregating 224 runs at 24.89. His English critics were placated when India returned in 1974 and Gavaskar scored 101 and 58 in the second Test at Old Trafford. He managed 227 runs at 37.83 as India were whitewashed 3–0.

=== West Indies tour ===
Gavaskar&#x27;s 1974–75 series against the West Indies was interrupted, playing in only the First and fifth and final Test of the series against the West Indies. He scored 108 runs at 27, with an 86 bowled by Lance Gibbs at Bombay&#x27;s Wankhede Stadium hosting the first test on this ground, the closest the Indian public got to see a century. The Test was the start of a world record streak of 106 Test appearances.

The 1975–76 season saw three and four Test tours of New Zealand and the West Indies, respectively. Gavaskar led India in a Test for the first time in January 1976 against New Zealand during the First Test in Auckland when regular captain Bishen Singh Bedi was suffering from a leg injury. Standing in despite having scored only 703 runs at 28.12 since his debut series, Gavaskar rewarded the selectors with 116 and 35*. As a result, India secured an eight-wicket victory. He ended the series with 266 runs at 66.33. On the West Indian leg of the tour, Gavaskar scored consecutive centuries of 156 and 102 in the Second and Third Tests, both in Port of Spain, Trinidad. These were his third and fourth centuries at the grounds. In the Third Test, his 102 helped India post 4/406 to set a world record for the highest winning fourth innings score. The Indians&#x27; mastery of the Caribbean spinners on a turning track reportedly led West Indian captain Clive Lloyd to vow that he would rely on pace alone in future Tests. Gavaskar totalled 390 runs at 55.71 for the series.

=== First home test century ===
Gavaskar was not to score a century on home soil until November 1976. In an eight-Test season, three and five against New Zealand and England, respectively, Gavaskar scored centuries in the first and last Tests of the season. The first was 119 in front of his home crowd at the Wankhede Stadium, helping India to a victory. Gavaskar scored another half-century in the Second Test to end the series with 259 at 43.16. In the First Test against England at Delhi, he was mobbed upon becoming the first Indian to reach 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year. A steady series saw him finish with 394 runs at 39.4 with a century coming in the Fifth Test and two half-centuries.

=== Tour of Australia ===
In 1977–78 he toured Australia, scoring three consecutive Test centuries (113, 127, 118) in the second innings of the first three Tests at Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne, respectively. India won the third but lost the earlier two. He finished the Five Test series with 450 runs at 50, failing twice as India lost the final Test and the series 3–2.

=== India Tour of Pakistan ===
1978–79 saw India tour Pakistan for the first series between the arch-rivals for 17 years. For the first time, Gavaskar faced Pakistani pace spearhead Imran Khan, who described him as &quot;The most compact batsman I&#x27;ve bowled to.&quot; Gavaskar scored 89 in the First Test and 97 in the Second, which India drew and lost, respectively. Gavaskar saved his best for the Third Test in Karachi, scoring 111 and 137 in the Third, but was unable to prevent a defeat and series loss. His twin centuries made him the first Indian to score two centuries in one Test on two occasions, and saw him pass Umrigar as India&#x27;s leading Test run-scorer. Gavaskar finished the series with 447 runs at 89.40.

== Captaincy ==
Gavaskar was captain of the Indian team on several occasions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, although his record is less than impressive. Often equipped with unpenetrative bowling attacks he tended to use conservative tactics which resulted in a large number of draws. During his tenure, Kapil Dev emerged as a leading pace bowler for the country. He captained India to nine victories and eight losses, but most of the games were drawn, 30.

=== First test series as a captain ===
His first series in charge was a West Indian visit to India for a six Test series. Gavaskar&#x27;s several large centuries contrasted with several failures. His 205 in the First Test made him the first Indian to score a double century in India against the West Indies. He added a further 73 in the second innings of a high scoring draw. After failing to score in the Second Test, he scored 107 and 182 not out in the Third Test at Calcutta, another high scoring draw. This made him the first player in Test history to achieve centuries in both innings of a Test three times. He managed only 4 and 1 in the Fourth Test in Madras as India forced the only win of the series. He posted a fourth century for the series, scoring 120 in the Fifth Test at Delhi, becoming the first Indian to pass 4000 Test runs. He aggregated 732 runs at 91.50 for the series, securing India a 1–0 win in his first series as captain.

=== Stripped of the captaincy ===
Despite this, he was stripped of the captaincy when India toured England in 1979 for a four Test tour. The official reason given was that Srinivas Venkataraghavan was preferred due to his superior experience on English soil, but most observers believed that Gavaskar was punished because he was believed to be considering defecting to World Series Cricket. He started consistently, scoring four half-centuries in five innings of the first three Tests. It was in the Fourth Test at The Oval that he produced his finest innings on English soil. India was 1–0 down needed to reach a world record target of 438 to square the series. They reached 76/0 at stumps on the fourth day. Led by Gavaskar, India made steady progress to be 328/1 with 20 overs remaining on the final day with a record-breaking victory still possible. An Ian Botham led fightback saw Gavaskar removed, with India still needing 49 runs from 46 balls. With three balls left in the match, all four results were possible. India ended nine runs short with two wickets in hand when stumps were drawn. According to Sanjay Manjrekar, it was &quot;Vintage Gavaskar, playing swing bowling to perfection, taking his time initially and then opening up. Nothing in the air, everything copybook.&quot; He ended the series with 542 runs at 77.42 and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.

=== Restored to captaincy ===
Gavaskar was restored to the captaincy for the gruelling 1979–80 season, with six Test home series against both Australia and Pakistan. The first two Tests against Australia were high scoring draws where only 45 wickets fell, with India taking a first-innings lead in both after making scores over 400. India broke through for a 153-run win in the Third Test at Kanpur, where Gavaskar scored 76. He made 115 in the Fourth Test in Delhi, where India were unable to convert a 212-run first innings lead, resulting in a draw. After another stalemate in the Fifth Test, Gavaskar scored 123 in the Sixth Test, where Australia collapsed by an innings after India posted their fourth first innings in excess of 400 for the series. The series against Pakistan was similarly high scoring, with four draws, three of which did not reach the fourth innings. India won the Third and Fifth Tests in Bombay and Madras. At Madras, he made 166 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 29 when India brought up the winning runs. Having secured the series 2–0, Gavaskar was removed from the captaincy for the drawn Sixth Test. This occurred because Gavaskar had refused to tour the West Indies for another series immediately afterwards, asking for a rest. As a result, Gundappa Viswanath was appointed so that he could prepare his leadership skills for the tour. In the end the tour did not go ahead as the West Indian board were not interested in a team without Gavaskar. The season ended with a one-off Test against England in Bombay, which India lost. In the 13 Tests that season, he made 1027 runs at 51.35 with three centuries and four half-centuries. This ended a 14-month span in which Gavaskar played in 22 Tests and the 1979 Cricket World Cup. In that time, he scored 2301 Test runs including eight centuries.

=== Australian Tour ===
The 1980–81 season saw Gavaskar returned as captain for the Australasian tour, but it was to be the start of an unhappy reign for Gavaskar and India. He managed only 118 runs at 19.66 in the three Tests against Australia, but his impact in Australia was for a controversial incident. At the Melbourne Cricket Ground, when Gavaskar was given out by the Australian umpire Rex Whitehead, he ordered his fellow opener Chetan Chauhan off the field. Instead of abandoning the match, the Indian manager, SK Durani persuaded Chauhan to return to the match which India went on to win by 59 runs as Australia collapsed to 83 in their second innings. India drew the series 1–1 but the following three-Test series in New Zealand was to signal the start of a barren run of 19 Tests under Gavaskar of which India were to win only one and lose five. India lost to New Zealand 1–0, with Gavaskar managing 126 runs at 25.2. He finished the Oceania tour with 244 runs at 22.18, with only two half-centuries, making little impact.

=== England in India ===
The 1981–82 Indian season saw a hard-fought 1–0 series win over England in six Tests. India took the First Test, before five consecutive draws resulted, four of which did not even reach the fourth innings. Gavaskar made 172 in the Second Test at Bangalore and reached a half-century on three further occasions to compile 500 runs at 62.5. India reciprocated England&#x27;s visit in 1982 for a three-Test series, which was lost 1–0. Gavaskar made 74 runs at 24.66 but was unable to bat in the Third Test.

=== Sri Lanka Tour ===
The 1982–83 subcontinental season started well for Gavaskar on an individual note, as he made 155 in a one-off Test against Sri Lanka in Madras. It was the first Test between the two nations, with Sri Lankan having only recently been awarded Test status. Despite this, India were unable to finish off their novice opponents, the draw heralding a start of a winless summer. India played in twelve Tests, losing five and drawing seven. The first series was a six Test tour to Pakistan. India started well enough, drawing the First Test in Lahore, with Gavaskar scoring 83. Pakistan then defeated India in three consecutive matches. In the Third Test in Faisalabad, Gavaskar managed an unbeaten 127 in the second innings to force Pakistan into a run chase, but the other two losses were substantial, both by an innings. Despite holding on for draws in the last two Tests, Gavaskar was replaced by Kapil Dev as captain after the 3–0 loss. Despite his team&#x27;s difficulties, Gavaskar remained productive with 434 runs at 47.18 with a century and three half centuries. Gavaskar went on to the West Indies for a five Test tour purely as a batsman, but could not reproduce the form that he had shown in the Caribbean in 1971 and 1976. He managed only 240 runs at 30, as India were crushed 2–0 by the world champions. Apart from an unbeaten 147 in the drawn Third Test in Georgetown, Guyana, his next best effort was 32.

The 1983–84 season started with a home series against Pakistan, with all three matches being drawn. Gavaskar scored an unbeaten 103 in the First Test in Bangalore, and made two further half centuries to total 264 runs at 66.

=== Overtaking Bradman&#x27;s test record ===
The Pakistan series was followed by a six Test series against the touring West Indies at the height of their powers. The First Test was held in Kanpur and India were crushed by an innings. Gavaskar had his bat knocked out of his hand by a hostile delivery from Malcolm Marshall before being dismissed. In the Second Test in Delhi, Gavaskar delivered his riposte to Marshall, hooking him for a consecutive four and six to start his innings. Gavaskar, unwilling to be dictated to by the Caribbean pacemen, hooked the short-pitched barrage relentlessly, reaching his half century in 37 balls. He then went on to score 121, his 29th Test century in 94 balls in his 95th test match, equalling Don Bradman&#x27;s world record. He also passed 8,000 Test runs in the innings, and was personally honoured by Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India at the ground. The match was drawn. Gavaskar&#x27;s 90 in the Third Test at Ahmedabad saw him pass Geoff Boycott&#x27;s Test world record of 8,114 career runs, but was insufficient to prevent another defeat. During the Fifth Test in the series, India were defeated by an innings at Calcutta to concede a 3–0 series lead. India had won only one of their 32 most recent Tests and none of their last 28. The crowd singled out Gavaskar, who had made a golden duck and 20. Angry spectators pelted objects onto the playing arena and clashed with police, before stoning the team bus. In the Sixth Test in Madras, he compiled his 30th Test century in his 99th test match, with an unbeaten 236 which was the highest Test score by an Indian. It was his 30th Test century and third double century against the West Indies, propelling him to overtake Donald Bradman&#x27;s 29 test centuries record. He scored a total of 505 runs at an average of 50.50 for the series.

=== Failure to win for successive Tests ===
With India having failed to win for 29 successive Tests, Kapil was sacked as captain and Gavaskar resumed leadership at the start of the 1984–85 season. The two Test tour of Pakistan resulted in two further draws, with Gavaskar compiling 120 runs at 40. The First Test against England saw India break through for its first Test victory in 32 matches. It proved to be a false dawn, with England squaring the series 1–1 in Delhi before another controversial Third Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta. The hostile crowd watched as India batted for over two days to reach 7/437 after 203 overs. Angry with the slow pace of India&#x27;s innings, the crowd chanted &quot;Gavaskar down! Gavaskar out!&quot; blaming him for India&#x27; performance. The local police chief reportedly asked Gavaskar to declare to placate the angry crowd. When Gavaskar led his team onto the field, he was pelted with fruit.

Gavaskar vowed never to play at Eden Gardens again, and duly withdrew from the team for India&#x27;s next fixture at the Bengali capital two years later, ending his record of 106 consecutive Tests. The match was drawn, but India conceded the series after losing the Fourth. The series ended 1–2, and with a poor display of 140 runs at 17.5, Gavaskar resigned, although he had already announced his intention to relinquish the leadership before the series. The change of captain improved the form of neither Gavaskar nor India as they toured Sri Lanka for a three-Test series. India were embarrassed 1–0 by the Test minnows at the time, with Gavaskar managing only 186 runs at 37.2.

== International farewell ==
In 1985–86, India toured Australia. All three Tests were drawn. Gavaskar scored an unbeaten 166 in the First Test in Adelaide and 172 in the Third Test in Sydney, ending the series with 352 runs at 117.33. A three-Test tour of England saw him score only 185 runs at 30.83, which India won 2–0 despite his lack of production. In 1986–87, Gavaskar&#x27;s final season in Test cricket, India faced a long season of eleven home Tests. Against an Australian team, Gavaskar made 90 in the second innings of the First Test in Madras (now Chennai), giving India a chance to reach the target of 348, which ended in a tie. He scored 103 in the Third Test to end the series with 205 runs at 51.66. The First Test against Sri Lanka in Kanpur saw Gavaskar&#x27;s 34th and final Test century of 176. He scored 74 and 5 in the next two Tests as India won the three-match series 2–0. The five-Test series against arch enemies Pakistan was to be his last. Gavaskar scored 91 in the drawn First Test in Madras before withdrawing from the Second Test in Calcutta as he had promised. In the Fourth Test in Ahmedabad, Gavaskar&#x27;s 63 made him the first batsman to pass 10,000 runs. With the teams locked 0–0 leading into the final Test in Bangalore, there was to be no fairytale. Gavaskar was dismissed for 96 in the second innings as India were bowled out to give Pakistan a 1–0 series win.

Gavaskar rounded out his international career with the 1987 Cricket World Cup. He scored 300 runs at an average of 50 at the tournament. Against New Zealand in the league phase he recorded his highest ODI score of 103*. The good form however did not continue into the semifinals where Phil Defreitas bowled him for 4 runs in his last international innings.

== Style ==
Gavaskar was also a fine slip fielder and his safe catching in the slips helped him become the first Indian (excluding wicket-keepers) to take over a hundred catches in Test matches. In one ODI against Pakistan in Sharjah in 1985, he took four catches and helped India defend a small total of 125. Early in his Test career, when India rarely used pace bowlers, Gavaskar also opened the bowling for a short spell on occasions if only one pace bowler was playing, before a three-pronged spin attack took over. The only wicket claimed by him is that of Pakistani Zaheer Abbas in 1978–79.

While Gavaskar could not be described as an attacking batsman, he had the ability of keeping the scoreboard ticking with unique shots such as the &quot;late flick&quot;. His focus of technical correctness over flair meant that his style of play was usually less suited to the shorter form of the game, at which he had less success. His infamous 36 not out in the 1975 World Cup, carrying his bat through the full 60 overs against England, led Indian supporters to storm the field and confront him for scoring so slowly when India needed nearly a run a ball to win; at the end of the game India had lost only three wickets but scored 200 runs less than England. Gavaskar almost went through his career without scoring a one-day century. He managed his first (and only) ODI century in the 1987 World Cup, when he hit 103 not out in 88 balls against New Zealand in his penultimate ODI innings at Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur.

== Controversies ==
On 25 March 2008, Malcolm Speed, ICC chief executive, told Gavaskar &quot;very clearly&quot;, during a meeting between the two at Dubai, that he would have to quit his post at the ICC if he failed to give up his job of commentator and newspaper columnist, in which capacity he has frequently criticised his employers and levelled serious accusations of racism. He sparked a controversy in early 2008 for his comments on the contentious Sydney Test match: &quot;Millions of Indians want to know if it (match referee Mike Procter&#x27;s verdict against Harbhajan Singh) was a &#x27;white man&#x27; taking the &#x27;white man&#x27;s&#x27; word against that of the &#x27;brown man&#x27;. Quite simply, if there was no audio evidence, nor did the officials hear anything, then the charge did not stand.&quot; Despite the fact that Gavaskar&#x27;s comment referenced Mike Procter and not the ICC, Australian writer Gideon Haigh said that, if Gavaskar genuinely believed this, &quot;then he should almost certainly resign, for if the ICC is a bastion of &#x27;white man&#x27;s justice&#x27;, Gavaskar bears some of the blame for having failed to change it.

== Personal life ==
Born in a Marathi speaking Brahmin family to Meenal (née Mantri) &amp; Manohar Gavaskar, Gavaskar is married to Marshneill Gavaskar (née Mehrotra), daughter of a leather industrialist from Kanpur. Their son, Rohan, born in Kanpur, was also a cricketer who played 11 One Day Internationals for India, but could not cement his spot in the team. Rohan was given the name &quot;Rohan Jaivishwa&quot; by his father as a tribute to his 3 favourite cricketers—&quot;Rohan&quot; Kanhai; M. L. &quot;Jai&quot;simha; and Rohan&#x27;s uncle, Gundappa &quot;Vishwa&quot;nath—although his name is usually recorded as Rohan Sunil Gavaskar.

As per his autobiography, &quot;Sunny Days&quot;, in his own version, Sunil Gavaskar stated that he was exchanged with a fisherman&#x27;s baby at birth. It was his uncle who spotted that the child was not Sunil as he had a birthmark near his ear. &quot;Perhaps, I would have grown up to be an obscure fisherman, toiling somewhere along the west coast,&quot; Gavaskar wrote.

His maternal uncle was retired Indian cricketer Madhav Mantri. His sister Kavita Viswanath is married to cricketer Gundappa Viswanath. His other sister—Nutan Gavaskar was the honorary general secretary of Women&#x27;s Cricket Association of India (WCAI).

According to a recollection by his son Rohan, Gavaskar saved a Muslim family from a violent mob during the 1993 Bombay riots. “We were standing on our terrace right after the bomb blasts, a few days later, when we saw a hate mob, and they had cornered a family. We knew they did not have any good intentions towards the family and dad saw that, ran down and confronted the hate mob. He told the mob, ‘whatever you are going to do that family, you are going to do to me first’, and then better sense prevailed and the family was allowed to go its way.&quot;

Gavaskar is an ardent devotee of Sathya Sai Baba.

==In popular culture==
The 2021 film &quot;83&quot; features Tahir Raj Bhasin as Gavaskar.

<text>Dunbar () is a town on the North Sea coast in East Lothian in the south-east of Scotland, approximately east of Edinburgh and from the English border north of Berwick-upon-Tweed.

Dunbar is a former royal burgh, and gave its name to an ecclesiastical and civil parish. The parish extends around east to west and is deep at its greatest extent, or , and contains the villages of West Barns, Belhaven, and East Barns (abandoned) and several hamlets and farms.

Dunbar has a harbour dating from 1574 and is home to the Dunbar Lifeboat Station, the second-oldest RNLI station in Scotland. The Dunbar Primary School and Dunbar Grammar School opened in the 1950s and 1960s.

Dunbar is the birthplace of the explorer, naturalist, and influential conservationist John Muir. The house in which Muir was born is located on the High Street, and has been converted into a museum. There is also a commemorative statue beside the town clock, and John Muir Country Park is located to the north-west of the town. The eastern section of the John Muir Way coastal path starts from the harbour. One of the two campuses to Dunbar Primary School: John Muir Campus, is named in his honour. A sculpture, The DunBear, the focal point of the DunBear Park mixed-use development, was erected as a tribute to John Muir and his role in the establishment of National Parks in the USA.

==History==


===Etymology===
In its present form, the name &quot;Dunbar&quot; is derived from its Gaelic equivalent (modern Scottish Gaelic: &#x27;), meaning &quot;summit fort&quot;. That itself is probably a Gaelicisation of the Cumbric form &#x27;, with the same meaning. This form seems to be attested as &quot;Dynbaer&quot; in the seventh-century &quot;Vita Sancti Wilfrithi&quot;.

=== Pre-history ===
Excavations in advance of a housing development by CFA Archaeology, in 2003, found the remains of a later Bronze Age/early Iron Age (800–540 BC) person, indicating that people were living in the area during that time.

To the north of the present High Street an area of open ground called Castle Park preserves almost exactly the hidden perimeter of an Iron Age promontory fort. The early settlement was a principal centre of the people known to the Romans as Votadini.

===Early history===
Dunbar was subsumed into Anglian Northumbria as that kingdom expanded in the 6th century and is believed to be synonymous with the Dynbaer of Eddius around 680, the first time that it appears in the written record.

The 2003 archaeological excavation also found a cemetery comprising 32 long-cist burials. Cemeteries of this type date from the early Christian period (AD 4th–8th centuries) and have been found in several areas around Dunbar, including to the east of Spott roundabout and at the Dunbar swimming pool indicated a settlement existed during this time.

The influential Northumbrian monk and scholar St Cuthbert, born around 630, was probably from around Dunbar: while still a boy, and employed as a shepherd, one night he had a vision of the soul of Saint Aidan being carried to heaven by angels and thereupon went to the monastery of Old Melrose and became a monk.

It was then a king&#x27;s vill and prison to Bishop Wilfrid. As a royal holding of the kings of Northumbria, the economy centred on the collecting of food renders and the administration of the northern (now Scottish) portion of that kingdom. It was the base of a senior royal official, a reeve (later sheriff).

===Scottish conquest===
Danish and Norse attacks on southern Northumbria caused its power to falter and the northern portion became equally open to annexation by Scotland. Dunbar was burnt by Kenneth MacAlpin in the 9th century. Scottish control was consolidated in the next century and when Lothian was ceded to Malcolm II after the battle of Carham in 1018, Dunbar was finally an acknowledged part of Scotland.

Throughout these turbulent centuries Dunbar&#x27;s status must have been preserved because it next features as part of a major land grant and settlement by Malcolm III in favour of the exiled earl Gospatric of Northumbria (to whom he may have been full cousin) during 1072. Malcolm needed to fill a power vacuum on his south-eastern flank; Gospatric required a base from which to plot the resumption of his Northumbrian holding. The grant included Dunbar and, it can be deduced, an extensive swath of East Lothian and Berwickshire or Merse (hence March). Gospatric founded the family of Dunbar. The head of the House of Dunbar filled the position of Earls of Dunbar and March until the 15th century.

===Later history===
The town became successively a baronial burgh and royal burgh (1370). Cultivated rabbit warrens on the links to the east and west of the town supplied food to the royal household. In 1589, storms and windblown sand destroyed the warren on the west links.

Major battles were fought nearby in 1296 and 1650. The latter was fought during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms between a Scottish Covenanter army and English Parliamentarians led by Oliver Cromwell. The Scots were routed, leading to the overthrow of the monarchy and the occupation of Scotland.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Castle Park Barracks in 1855.

The local band, Dunbar Royal British Legion Pipe Band, which was founded in 1976, has competed with success in national competitions.

On 3 January 1987, a devastating fire destroyed much of the town&#x27;s historic parish church: though the fire practically destroyed the monument and left only the outer walls remaining, the church has since been rebuilt with a modern interior.

==Archaeology==
During 2003, archaeological excavations at Oxwell Mains (Lafarge Cement Works) near Dunbar revealed the site of a Mesolithic house believed to be from around the 9th millennium BC. The site suggests a domed building. Although considered extremely rare and a site of national importance this site is in the middle of an area planned for quarrying.

An archaeological excavation undertaken by Headland Archaeology on a site previously occupied by the Captain&#x27;s Cabin (a local landmark) within the area of Castle Park identified a sequence of archaeological features reflecting around 2,000 years of human activity.

The earliest feature was a large ditch which may have formed part of the defences around a promontory fort previously identified during earlier excavations near the coast at Castle Park. The scale of the ditches indicated an impressive monument. A radiocarbon date of between 50 BC and AD 70 was obtained from charcoal recovered from its infill.

Much later a rectangular building was built over the top of the infilled ditch. Large quantities of burnt grain were recovered indicating that the building was a grain store that had been destroyed by fire. It was established that this was part of the Anglian settlement that had also been identified during earlier excavations.

Between the 9th and 11th centuries the area was used as a cemetery. Archeologists excavated 76 articulated skeletons, and the disarticulated remains of a further 51 individuals were recovered. The articulated skeletons were all buried in the standard Christian fashion. A small number of the skeletons were in long cists, but the majority were simple shroud burials.

A dump or midden above the cemetery contained many elephant ivory off-cuts dating to the 18th or 19th century.

==Climate==
As with most of the British Isles, Dunbar has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with cool summers and mild winters. It is one of the sunniest and driest places in Scotland, with around 1,450 hours of sunshine and of rainfall annually. Temperature extremes range from in August 1990 to in January 1982.

==Environment==
Due to its geographical location, Dunbar receives less rain and more hours of direct sunshine per year than most places in Scotland.

Dunbar has two promenades, forming part of the John Muir Way. These provide an ideal viewpoint to see Dunbar&#x27;s geological features including volcanic deposits and dykes seen from a high vantage point on the western clifftop promenade which passes the town&#x27;s Public and Winterfield parks.

There are two local beaches, the smaller East Beach next to the town featuring rock pools and the expansive Belhaven Beach on the outskirts.

Lochend Woods are a community resource owned and managed by the Dunbar Community Woodland Group.

==Economy==

The town centre has several independent, locally owned retail businesses, including gift shops, salons, cafes, a community-owned bakery and grocer and fishmonger, traditional sweet shop, chocolatiere, florists, garden centre (located within Knox’s Newsagents) and pet shop. The town also has a zero waste shop as well as several vintage and antique stores and two charity shops. There are two RNLI stores reflecting the town&#x27;s maritime connection. The High Street also features historic closes, two museums, and the &quot;Backlands&quot; garden and is a short walk to the scenic harbour area with its summertime food outlets. On the periphery of the town is a large garden centre with cafe, an Asda store accompanied by a drive-thru McDonald&#x27;s built in late 2015, a restaurant and hotel owned by Marston&#x27;s named the Pine Marten.

Local businesses are supported by the Dunbar Trades Association, now in its 75th year.

Tourists are attracted to the walking and cycling routes in the area with other long-distance routes, the John Muir Way and Coast &amp; Castles routes. Dunbar has many hotels, B &amp; Bs, a hostel, and campsites as well as short term lets. Adventure activities include surfing, wakeboarding, coasteering, kite surfing, stand up paddleboarding (SUP), boat and fishing tours, as well as orienteering activities run by the East Lothian Countryside Ranger Service. Dunbar has a large indoor pool, many sports facilities, tennis courts, bowling greens, and facilities for petanque and putting.

Agriculture remains important but fishing has declined, although the harbour is still active mainly landing shellfish. The main manufacturers are Tarmac, producing cement at Oxwell Mains (the only integrated cement plant in Scotland), and Belhaven Brewery, producing Scottish Ale.

==Transport==
The town is served by the A1, connecting at Spott roundabout to the south of Dunbar, and Dunbar railway station which has links to Edinburgh and the rest of Scotland, as well to as London and stations along the north-east England corridor.

The town itself is served by two primary schools, West Barns Primary School and Dunbar Primary School, and a non-denominational state secondary school, Dunbar Grammar School. Dunbar Grammar School also serves a wide catchment area which includes the surrounding areas and villages of East Linton, Stenton, and Oldhamstocks. There is also a small number of children who live in Cockburnspath that attend Dunbar Grammar. The school currently has a roll of 1,006 pupils. As of August 2024, John Johnstone is the Head Teacher, succeeding Claire Slowther. Prior to Slowther’s ascent to Head Teacher from Deputy Head Teacher in August 2018, the school was run by longstanding Head Teacher Paul Raffaelli. Dunbar Primary School is split between two campuses, the original building which is now referred to as &quot;John Muir Campus&quot; taking Primary 1–3s along with nursery pupils, with the newer-built &quot;Lochend Campus&quot; taking Primary 4–7s.

<text>The Brobdingnagian Bards are a Celtic music group from Austin, Texas, United States.

==History==

Marc Gunn, formerly of Austin Texas&#x27; alternative rock bands Skander and Breastfed, released a solo album (&quot;Geography&quot;) featuring himself on autoharp and Andrew McKee on recorder in 1998. This initial collaboration lead to the official formation of the Brobdingnagian Bards in 1999.

The group&#x27;s name is derived from Brobdingnag, the kingdom of coarse giants described in Jonathan Swift&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. The band was made up of its original two members, Marc Gunn (autoharp, vocals), and Andrew McKee (recorder, mandolin, vocals).

The Brobdingnagian Bards musical style is best described as a mixture of Irish and Scottish folk music, with their original compositions often falling into the filk genre. Although the pair did perform a good deal of purely traditional songs, the band is most well known for their original works, including comedic pop-culture and sci-fi-themed parodies. Despite performing in a niche genre, this duo was ranked as one of the top 20 bands on the original MP3.com. Over time, the Bards also honed their act into live entertainment by adding comedy, with McKee being the &quot;straight-man&quot; to Gunn&#x27;s antics. As a result, they also became a familiar and popular act on both the renaissance faire and geek-show circuits.

The Bards had the honor of being headliners at the Oscar party for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. Both performers are from Austin, Texas, and have made regular appearances in the Austin Chronicle&#x27;s annual Austin Music Awards poll; they earned the #1 prize for &quot;Best Novelty Band&quot; in 2004, &quot;Best None of the Above&quot; performing band in 2006 (the first Celtic band to ever win such accolades), and &quot;Best Folk Act&quot; in 2007. The band has also made regular top-ten finishes in the folk band and world music categories. In 2002, the Bards were also given a critic&#x27;s pick award for &quot;Best Renaissance Men&quot; in the 2002 Best of Austin awards. 

In addition to the many conventions, fairs and music festivals the group performed at around the Austin area, they also have toured coast to coast, and developed a following of devoted listeners, referred to as &quot;Nagians.&quot; In 2007 and 2008, the Bards with several of their fans took a vacation tour of Ireland.

On September 15, 2008, the Brobdingnagian Bards band broke up amicably in order to pursue solo careers. They played one of their last public performances at The Browncoat Ball, organized by the Austin Browncoats.

The Bards reformed in 2012, performing at the Sherwood Celtic Music Festival near Austin and have continued to work together off and on since.

The Bards performed at DragonCon in Atlanta, GA in August 2013, 2016 and 2018.

<doc id="176796" wikidata="Q244968" url="?curid=176796" title="Maharishi Mahesh Yogi">
<text>Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (born Mahesh Prasad Varma, 12 January 191? – 5 February 2008) was the creator of Transcendental Meditation (TM) and leader of the worldwide organization that has been characterized in multiple ways, including as a new religious movement and as non-religious. He became known as &quot;Maharishi&quot; (meaning &quot;great seer&quot;) and &quot;Yogi&quot; as an adult.

After earning a degree in physics at Allahabad University in 1942, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi became an assistant and disciple of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev), the Shankaracharya (spiritual leader) of the Jyotir Math in the Indian Himalayas. The Maharishi credits Brahmananda Saraswati with inspiring his teachings. In 1955, the Maharishi began to introduce his Transcendental Deep Meditation (later renamed Transcendental Meditation) to India and the world. His first global tour began in 1958. His devotees referred to him as &quot;His Holiness&quot;, and because he laughed frequently in early TV interviews, he was sometimes referred to as the &quot;giggling guru.&quot;

The Maharishi trained more than 40,000 TM teachers, taught the Transcendental Meditation technique to &quot;more than five million people&quot; and founded thousands of teaching centres and hundreds of colleges, universities and schools, while TM websites report that tens of thousands have learned the TM-Sidhi programme. His initiatives include schools and universities with campuses in several countries, including India, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. The Maharishi, his family and close associates created charitable organisations and for-profit businesses, including health clinics, mail-order health supplement stores and organic farms. The reported value of the Maharishi&#x27;s organization has ranged from the millions to billions of U.S. dollars; in 2008, the organization placed the value of their United States assets at about $300 million.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Maharishi achieved fame as the guru to the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and other celebrities. In the late 1970s, he started the TM-Sidhi programme, which proposed to improve the mind–body relationship of practitioners through techniques such as Yogic flying. The Maharishi&#x27;s Natural Law Party was founded in 1992 and ran campaigns in dozens of countries. He moved to near Vlodrop, the Netherlands, in the same year. In 2000, he created the Global Country of World Peace, a non-profit organization, and appointed its leaders. In 2008, the Maharishi announced his retirement from all administrative activities and went into silence until his death three weeks later.

==Life==

===Birth===
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi belonged to the Kayastha caste, a caste of scribes in India. The birth name and the birth dates of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi are not known with certainty, in part because of the tradition of ascetics and monks to relinquish family connections. Many accounts say he was born Mahesh Prasad Varma into a Kayastha family living in the Central Provinces of British India. A different name appears in the Allahabad University list of distinguished alumni, where he is listed as M.C. Srivastava, and an obituary says his name was &quot;Mahesh Srivastava&quot;.

Various accounts give the year of his birth as 1911, 1917 or 1918. Authors Paul Mason and William Jefferson say that he was born 12 January 1917 in Rajim, Central Provinces, British India (Chhattisgarh, India). The place of birth given in his passport is &quot;Pounalulla&quot;, India, and his birth date 12 January 1918. Mahesh &quot;most likely&quot; came from an upper-caste family of the high-status Kayastha caste, whose traditional profession is writing.

===Early life===
Mahesh studied physics at Allahabad University and earned a degree in 1942. While a few sources say that he worked at the Gun Carriage Factory in Jabalpur for some time, most report that in 1941 he became an administrative secretary to the Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Math, Swami Brahmananda Saraswati (also known as Guru Dev, which means &quot;divine teacher&quot;) and took a new name, Bal Brahmachari Mahesh. Coplin refers to &quot;bala brahmachari&quot; as both a title and a name and considers that it &quot;identified him as a fully dedicated student of spiritual knowledge and life-long celibate ascetic.&quot; Brahmananda insisted that before accepting Mahesh as a pupil he must first complete his university degree and get permission from his parents. The Maharishi recalls how it took about two and a half years to attune himself to the thinking of Brahmananda Saraswati and to gain &quot;a very genuine feeling of complete oneness&quot;. At first Brahmachari Mahesh performed common chores but gained trust and became Guru Dev&#x27;s &quot;personal secretary&quot; and &quot;favored pupil&quot;. He was trusted to take care of the bulk of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati&#x27;s correspondence without direction and was also sent out to give public speeches on Vedic (scriptural) themes. The Maharishi said his life truly began in 1940, at the feet of his master, when he learned the secret of swift and deep meditation.

Brahmachari Mahesh remained with Swami Brahmananda Saraswati until the latter died in 1953, when he moved to Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand in the Himalayas, where he undertook a reclusive life for two years. Although Brahmachari Mahesh was a close disciple, he could not be the Shankaracharya&#x27;s spiritual successor, because he was not a Brahmin. The Shankaracharya, at the end of his life, charged him with the responsibility of travelling and teaching meditation to the masses, while he named Swami Shantananda Saraswati as his successor.

===Tour in India (1955–1957)===
In 1955, Brahmachari Mahesh left Uttarkashi and began publicly teaching what he stated was a traditional meditation technique learned from his master Brahmananda Saraswati, and that he called Transcendental Deep Meditation. Later the technique was renamed Transcendental Meditation. It was also then that he was first publicly known with the name &quot;Maharishi&quot;, an honorific title meaning &quot;great sage&quot;, after the title was given to him according to some sources from &quot;Indian Pundits&quot;; according to another source the honorific was given along with Yogi by followers in India. Later in the west, the title was retained as a name.

He travelled around India for two years interacting with his &quot;Hindu audiences&quot; in an &quot;Indian context&quot;. At that time, he called his movement the Spiritual Development Movement, but renamed it the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in 1957, in Madras, on the concluding day of the Seminar of Spiritual Luminaries. According to Coplin, in his visits to southern India, the Maharishi spoke English rather than the Hindi spoken in his home area to avoid provoking resistance among those seeking linguistic self-determination, and to appeal to the &quot;learned classes&quot;.

===World tours (1958–1968)===

According to William Jefferson, in 1958, the Maharishi went to Madras to address a large crowd of people who had gathered to celebrate the memory of &quot;Guru Dev&quot;. It was there that he spontaneously announced that he planned to spread the teaching of TM throughout the world. Hundreds of people immediately asked to learn TM. In 1959, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began his first world tour, writing: &quot;I had one thing in mind, that I know something which is useful to every man&quot;.

The Maharishi&#x27;s 1986 book, &quot;Thirty Years Around the World&quot;, gives a detailed account of his world tours, as do two biographies, &quot;The Story of the Maharishi&quot;, by William Jefferson, and &quot;The Maharishi&quot; by Paul Mason. The first world tour began in Rangoon, Burma (now Myanmar), and included the countries of Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong and Hawaii. He arrived in Hawaii in the spring of 1959, and the &quot;Honolulu Star Bulletin&quot; reported: &quot;He has no money, he asks for nothing. His worldly possessions can be carried in one hand. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is on a world odyssey. He carries a message that he says will rid the world of all unhappiness and discontent.&quot; In 1959, the Maharishi lectured and taught the Transcendental Meditation technique in Honolulu, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, New York and London. While in Los Angeles, the Maharishi stayed at the home of author Helena Olson, and during this period he developed a three-year plan to propagate Transcendental Meditation to the whole world. Though most of his audience consisted of average middle class individuals, he also attracted a few celebrities, such as Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Nancy Cooke de Herrera and Doris Duke.

When the Maharishi came to the U.S. in 1959, his Spiritual Regeneration Movement was called Transcendental Meditation. That same year, he began the International Meditation Society and other organizations to propagate his teachings, establishing centres in San Francisco and London. For years, the sole teacher of Transcendental Meditation in America was a San Diego woman named Beulah Smith.

In 1960, the Maharishi traveled to many cities in India, France, Switzerland, England, Scotland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa.

While in Manchester, England, the Maharishi gave a television interview and was featured in many English newspapers, such as the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, the &quot;Oxford Mail&quot; and the &quot;Cambridge Daily News&quot;. This was also the year in which the Maharishi trained Henry Nyburg to be the first Transcendental Meditation teacher in Europe.

In 1961, the Maharishi visited the United States, Austria, Sweden, France, Italy, Greece, India, Kenya, England, and Canada. While in England, he appeared on BBC television and gave a lecture to 5,000 people at the Royal Albert Hall in London, organised by Leon MacLaren of the School of Economic Science. In April 1961, the Maharishi conducted his first Transcendental Meditation Teacher Training Course in Rishikesh, India, with sixty participants from various countries. Teachers continued to be trained as time progressed. During the course, the Maharishi began to introduce additional knowledge regarding the development of human potential and began writing his translation and commentary on the first six chapters of the ancient Vedic text, the Bhagavad Gita.

His 1962 world tour included visits to Europe, India, Australia and New Zealand. In Britain, he founded a branch of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement. The year concluded in California, where the Maharishi began dictating his book &quot;The Science of Being and Art of Living&quot;. In Rishikesh, India, beginning on 20 April 1962, a forty-day course was held for &quot;sadhus, sanyasis, and brahmacharis&quot; to introduce TM to &quot;religious preachers and spiritual masters in India&quot;.

The Maharishi toured cities in Europe, Asia, North America and India in 1963, and also addressed ministers of the Indian Parliament. According to his memoirs, twenty-one members of parliament then issued a public statement endorsing the Maharishi&#x27;s goals and meditation technique. His Canadian tour was also well covered by the press.

The Maharishi&#x27;s fifth world tour, in 1964, consisted of visits to many cities in North America, Europe and India. During his visit to England, he appeared with the Abbot of Downside, Abbot Butler, on a BBC television show called &quot;The Viewpoint&quot;. In October of that year, in California, the Maharishi began teaching the first Advanced Technique of Transcendental Meditation to some experienced meditators. While travelling in America, the Maharishi met with Robert Maynard Hutchins, the head of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, and U Thant, the Secretary General of the United Nations. During this same year, the Maharishi finished his book &quot;The Science of Being and Art of Living&quot;, which sold more than a million copies and was published in fifteen languages.

The Maharishi&#x27;s activities in 1966 included a course in India and a one-month tour in South America. He established Transcendental Meditation centers in Port of Spain, Trinidad; Caracas, Venezuela; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Porto Alegre, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Lima, Peru; and Bogota, Colombia.

In addition, in 1966 the Maharishi founded the Students&#x27; International Meditation Society (&quot;SIMS&quot;), which &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; later characterised as a &quot;phenomenal success&quot;. In the 1970s, SIMS centres were established at &quot;over one thousand campuses&quot;, including Harvard University, Yale University, and UCLA.

In 1967, the Maharishi gave a lecture at Caxton Hall in London, which was attended by Leon MacLaren, the founder and leader of the School of Economic Science (SES). He also lectured at UCLA, Harvard, Yale and Berkeley. That year, an article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the Maharishi &quot;has been sharply criticised by other Indian sages, who complain that his programme for spiritual peace without either penance or asceticism contravenes every traditional Hindu belief&quot;. Religion and culture scholar Sean McCloud also reported that traditional Indian sages and gurus were critical of the Maharishi for teaching a simple technique and making it available to everyone and for abandoning traditional concepts of suffering and concentration as paths to enlightenment. At the end of 1968, the Maharishi said that after ten years of teaching and world tours, he would return to India.

===Association with the Beatles===

In 1967, the Maharishi&#x27;s fame increased and his movement gained greater prominence when he became the &quot;spiritual advisor to the Beatles&quot;, though he was already well-known among young people in the UK and had already had numerous public appearances that brought him to the band&#x27;s attention. Following the Beatles&#x27; endorsement of TM, during 1967 and 1968 the Maharishi appeared on American magazine covers such as &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and many others. He gave lectures to capacity crowds at the Felt Forum in New York City and Harvard&#x27;s Sanders Hall. He also appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and the &quot;Today&quot; TV shows.

He and the Beatles met in London in August 1967, when George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd urged their friends to attend the Maharishi&#x27;s lecture at the Hilton on Park Lane. The band members went to study with the Maharishi in Bangor, Wales, before travelling to Rishikesh, India, in February 1968 to &quot;devote themselves fully to his instruction&quot;. Ringo Starr and his wife Maureen left after 10 days, Paul McCartney and Jane Asher left after five weeks; the group&#x27;s most dedicated students, Harrison and John Lennon, departed with their wives 16 days later.

During their stay, the Beatles heard that the Maharishi had allegedly made sexual advances towards Mia Farrow. On 15 June 1968, in London, the Beatles formally renounced their association with the Maharishi as a &quot;public mistake&quot;. &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; is the title of a song Lennon wrote in response to the episode. Lennon originally wanted to title the song &quot;Maharishi&quot;, but changed the title at Harrison&#x27;s request. Harrison commented years later, &quot;Now, historically, there&#x27;s the story that something went on that shouldn&#x27;t have done – but nothing did.&quot; In 1992, Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party and later apologised for the way the Maharishi had been treated, by saying, &quot;We were very young&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s probably in the history books that Maharishi &#x27;tried to attack Mia Farrow&#x27; – but it&#x27;s bullshit, total bullshit.&quot; Cynthia Lennon wrote in 2006 that she &quot;hated leaving on a note of discord and mistrust, when we had enjoyed so much kindness from the Maharishi&quot;. Asked if he forgave the Beatles, the Maharishi replied, &quot;I could never be upset with angels.&quot; McCartney took his daughter Stella to visit the Maharishi in the Netherlands in 2007, which renewed their friendship.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that the influence of the Maharishi, and the journey to Rishikesh to meditate, steered the Beatles away from LSD and inspired them to write many new songs. In 2009, McCartney commented that Transcendental Meditation was a gift the Beatles had received from the Maharishi at a time when they were looking for something to stabilise them. The Beatles&#x27; visit to the Maharishi&#x27;s ashram coincided with a thirty-participant Transcendental Meditation teacher training course that was ongoing when they arrived. Graduates of the course included Prudence Farrow and Mike Love.

Although the Rishikesh ashram had thrived in its early days, it was eventually abandoned in 2001. By 2016, some of it had been reclaimed with building repairs, cleared paths, a small photo museum, murals, a cafe and charges for visitors, although the site remains essentially a ruin.

===Further growth of the TM movement (1968–1990)===

In 1968, the Maharishi announced that he would stop his public activities and instead begin the training of TM teachers at his new global headquarters in Seelisberg, Switzerland. In 1969, he inaugurated a course in his Science of Creative Intelligence at Stanford University, which was then offered at 25 other American universities.

In 1970, the Maharishi held a TM teacher training course at a Victorian hotel in Poland Springs, Maine, with 1,200 participants. Later that year, he held a similar four-week course with 1500 participants at Humboldt State College in Arcata, California. In 1970, after having trouble with Indian tax authorities, he moved his headquarters to Italy, returning to India in the late 1970s. That same year, the City of Hope Foundation in Los Angeles gave the Maharishi their &quot;Man of Hope&quot; award.

By 1971, the Maharishi had completed 13 world tours, visited 50 countries, and held a press conference with American inventor Buckminster Fuller at his first International Symposium on SCI at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts. From 1970 to 1973, about 10,000 people attended the Maharishi sponsored symposia on his modern interpretation of Vedanta philosophy, called Science of Creative Intelligence. During these conferences, held at universities, the Maharishi spoke with &quot;leading thinkers&quot; of the day, such as Hans Selye, Marshall McLuhan, and Jonas Salk.

The Maharishi announced his World Plan in 1972, the goal of which was to establish 3,600 TM centres around the world. That year, a TM training course was given by the Maharishi at Queen&#x27;s University and was attended by 1,000 young people from the US and Canada. At the start of the course, the Maharishi encouraged the attendees to improve their appearance by getting haircuts and wearing ties. He also persuaded the U.S. Army to offer courses in TM to its soldiers and made videotaped recordings of what was thought to be the West&#x27;s first comprehensive recitation of the Rig Veda.

In March 1973, the Maharishi addressed the legislature of the state of Illinois. That same year, the legislature passed a resolution in support of the use of Maharishi&#x27;s Science of Creative Intelligence in Illinois public schools. Later that year, he organized a world conference of mayors in Switzerland. In that same year, he also addressed 3000 educators at an American Association of Higher Education (AAHE) conference on quality of life and higher education.

In 1974, Maharishi International University was founded at the site of the former Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa. In October 1975, the Maharishi was pictured on the front cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. He made his last visit to the Spiritual Regeneration Movement centre in Los Angeles in 1975, according to film director David Lynch, who met him for the first time there.

In 1975, the Maharishi embarked on a five-continent trip to inaugurate what he called &quot;the Dawn of the Age of Enlightenment&quot;. The Maharishi said the purpose of the inaugural tour was to &quot;go around the country and give a gentle whisper to the population&quot;. He visited Ottawa during this tour and had a private meeting with Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau, during which he spoke about the principles of TM and &quot;the possibility of structuring an ideal society&quot;. That same year, the Pittsburgh Press reported that &quot;The Maharishi has been criticised by other Eastern yogis for simplifying their ancient art.&quot; The Maharishi appeared as a guest on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; in 1975 and again in 1977, and this resulted in &quot;tens of thousands of new practitioners&quot; around the USA.
In the mid 1970s, the Maharishi&#x27;s U.S. movement was operating 370 TM centres manned by 6,000 TM teachers. At that time, the Maharishi also began approaching the business community via an organisation called the American Foundation for SCI (AFSCI), whose objective was to eliminate stress for business professionals. His TM movement came to be increasingly structured along the lines of a multinational corporation.

The teaching of TM and the Science of Creative Intelligence in a New Jersey public school was stopped when a US court, in 1977, declared the movement to be religious, and ruled adoption of TM by public organisations to be in breach of the separation of church and state (First Amendment).

During the 1980s, the organisation continued to expand and his meditation technique continued to attract celebrities, despite its &quot;outlandish claims&quot; and accusations of fraud from disaffected former disciples. The TM organization made a number of property investments, buying a former Rothschild mansion in England, Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire, Roydon Hall in Maidstone, Swythamley Park in the Peak District, and a Georgian rectory in Suffolk. In the United States, resorts and hotels, many in city centres, were purchased to be used as TM training centres. Doug Henning and the Maharishi planned a magical Vedic amusement park, Vedaland, and bought large tracts of land near Orlando, Florida, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, to host the park. The theme park was supposed to be a gateway into understanding the mysteries of the universe. According to the Maharishi&#x27;s official Vedic city website, &quot;Entering Veda Land through a secret cave on a windswept plateau high in the Himalayas the adventure starts as one travels through a waterfall that leads to a forest where an ancient Vedic civilization awaits to reveal the deepest secrets of the universe (sic)&quot;. These plans were never executed and, for Niagara Falls, Veda Land turned out to be just another theme park proposal that never materialized, joining an eclectic list that includes the Worlds of Jules Verne, the Ancient Chinese City and even Canada&#x27;s Wonderland when it was first being planned. The Maharishi commissioned plans from a prominent architect for the world&#x27;s tallest building, a Vedic-style pyramid to be built in São Paulo, Brazil, and to be filled with Yogic Flyers and other TM endeavours. The Maharishi founded Maharishi Ved Vigyan Vishwa Vidyapeetham, a self-described educational institution located in Uttar Pradesh, India, in 1982. The institution reports that it has trained 50,000 pundits in traditional Vedic recitation. In 1983, the Maharishi invited government leaders to interact with his organization called &quot;World Government&quot;.

In January 1988, offices at the Maharishinagar complex in New Delhi were raided by Indian tax authorities, and the Maharishi and his organisation were accused of falsifying expenses. Reports on the value of stocks, fixed-deposit notes, cash and jewels confiscated vary from source to source. The Maharishi, who was &quot;headquartered in Switzerland&quot; at the time, reportedly moved to the Netherlands &quot;after the Indian government accused him of tax fraud&quot;.) Following an earthquake in Armenia, the Maharishi trained Russian TM teachers and set up a Maharishi Ayurveda training centre in the Urals region. Beginning in 1989, the Maharishi&#x27;s movement began incorporating the term &quot;Maharishi&quot; into the names of their new and existing entities, concepts and programmes.

===Years in Vlodrop (1991–2008)===
In 1990, the Maharishi relocated his headquarters from Seelisberg, Switzerland, to a former Franciscan monastery in Vlodrop, the Netherlands, which became known as MERU, Holland, on account of the Maharishi European Research University (MERU) campus there. During his time in Vlodrop, he communicated to the public mainly via video and the internet. He also created a subscription-based, satellite TV channel, called Veda Vision, which broadcast content in 22 languages and 144 countries.

In 1991, the Maharishi called Washington, D.C. a &quot;pool of mud&quot; after a decade of attempts to lower the rate of crime in the city, which had the second-largest TM community in the US. He told his followers to leave and save themselves from its &quot;criminal atmosphere&quot;. The Maharishi is believed to have made his final public appearance in 1991, in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Deepak Chopra, described as &quot;one of the Maharishi&#x27;s top assistants before he launched his own career&quot;, wrote that the Maharishi collapsed in 1991 with kidney and pancreas failure, that the illness was kept secret by the Maharishi&#x27;s family, and that he tended to Maharishi during a year-long recovery. According to Chopra, the Maharishi accused him, in July 1993, of trying to compete for the position of guru and asked him to stop travelling and writing books, which led to Chopra&#x27;s decision to leave the movement in January 1994.

As part of a world plan for peace, the Maharishi inaugurated the Natural Law Party (NLP), calling it a &quot;natural government&quot;. His adherents founded the NLP in 1992. It was active in forty-two countries. John Hagelin, the NLP&#x27;s three-time candidate for U.S. president, denied any formal connection between the Maharishi and the party. According to spokesman Bob Roth, &quot;The Maharishi has said the party has to grow to encompass everyone.&quot; Critics charged that the party was an effort to recruit people for Transcendental Meditation, and that it resembled &quot;the political arm of an international corporation&quot; more than a &quot;home-grown political creation&quot;. The Indian arm of the NLP, the Ajeya Bharat Party, achieved electoral success, winning one seat in a state assembly in 1998. The Maharishi shut down the political effort in 2004, saying, &quot;I had to get into politics to know what is wrong there.&quot;

In 1992, the Maharishi began to send groups of Yogic Flyers to countries like India, Brazil, China and the United States of America in an effort to promote world peace through &quot;coherent world consciousness&quot;. In 1993 and 2003, he decided to raise the fees for learning the TM technique.

In 1997, the Maharishi&#x27;s organization built the largest wooden structure in the Netherlands without using any nails. The building was the Maharishi&#x27;s residence for the last two decades of his life. In later years, the Maharishi rarely left his two-room quarters in order to preserve his health and energy. He used videoconferencing to communicate with the world and with his advisors. Built to Maharishi Sthapatya Veda architectural standards, the structure, according to the Maharishi, is said to have helped him infuse &quot;the light of Total Knowledge&quot; into &quot;the destiny of the human race&quot;.

In 2000, the Maharishi founded the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) &quot;to create global world peace by unifying all nations in happiness, prosperity, invincibility and perfect health, while supporting the rich diversity of our world family&quot;. The Maharishi crowned Tony Nader, a physician and MIT-trained neuroscientist, as the king or Maharaja of the GCWP in 2000. The GCWP unsuccessfully attempted to establish a sovereign micronation when it offered US$1.3 billion to the President of Suriname for a 200-year lease of of land and in 2002, attempted to choose a king for the Talamanca, a &quot;remote Indian reservation&quot; in Costa Rica.

In 2001, Maharishi University Of Information Technology was founded at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh India.

In 2001, followers of the Maharishi founded Maharishi Vedic City a few miles north of Fairfield, Iowa, in the United States. This new city requires that the construction of its homes and buildings be done according to the Maharishi Sthapatya Veda principles of &quot;harmony with nature&quot;.

In a 2002 appearance on the CNN show, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, the first time in 25 years that the Maharishi had appeared in the mainstream media, he said &quot;Transcendental Meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results&quot;. It was occasioned by the reissue of the Maharishi&#x27;s book &quot;The Science of Being and Art of Living&quot;. That same year, the Maharishi Global Financing Research Foundation issued the &quot;Raam&quot; as a currency &quot;dedicated to financing peace promoting projects&quot;.

In 2003, David Lynch began a fundraising project to raise US$1 billion &quot;on behalf of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&quot; to build a meditation centre large enough to hold 8,000 skilled practitioners.

The Maharishi ordered a suspension of TM training in Britain in 2005 due to his opposition to prime minister Tony Blair&#x27;s decision to support the Iraq War. The Maharishi said that he did not want to waste the &quot;beautiful nectar&quot; of TM on a &quot;scorpion nation&quot;. He lifted the ban after Blair&#x27;s resignation in 2007. During this period, skeptics were critical of some of the Maharishi&#x27;s programmes, such as a US$10 trillion plan to end poverty through organic farming in poor countries and a US$1 billion plan to use meditation groups to end conflict.

===Death===
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, concerned about his health, became increasingly secluded in two rooms of his residence. During this period, he rarely had in-person meetings and instead communicated with his followers almost exclusively by closed-circuit television.

On 12 January 2008, the Maharishi declared: &quot;It has been my pleasure at the feet of Guru Dev (Brahmananda Saraswati), to take the light of Guru Dev and pass it on in my environment. Now today, I am closing my designed duty to Guru Dev. And I can only say, &#x27;Live long the world in peace, happiness, prosperity, and freedom from suffering.

A week before his death, the Maharishi said that he was &quot;stepping down as leader of the TM movement&quot; and &quot;retreating into silence&quot; and that he planned to spend his remaining time studying &quot;the ancient Indian texts&quot;. The Maharishi died peacefully in his sleep of natural causes on 5 February 2008 at his residence in Vlodrop, Netherlands. The cremation and funeral rites were conducted at the Maharishi&#x27;s Allahabad ashram in India, overlooking the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.

The funeral, with state honours, was carried by Sadhana TV station and was presided over by one of the claimants to the seat of Shankaracharya of the North, Swami Vasudevananda Saraswati Maharaj. Indian officials who attended the funeral included central minister Subodh Kant Sahay; Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Ashok Singhal; and former Uttar Pradesh assembly speaker and state BJP leader Keshri Nath Tripathi, as well as top local officials. Also in attendance were thirty-five rajas of the Global Country of World Peace, one-time disciple Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, and David Lynch. A troop of uniformed policemen lowered their arms in salute. The funeral received its status as a state funeral because the Maharishi was a recognised master in the tradition of Advaita Vedanta founded by Shankara.

The Maharishi is survived by a brother and &quot;a number of nephews&quot;. One nephew, Girish Chandra Varma, is chairman of the Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools Group and a &quot;senior functionary of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement in India.&quot; Other nephews include Prakash Shrivastav, president of Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools and Anand Shrivastava, chairman of the Maharishi Group.

In its obituary, BBC News reported that the Maharishi&#x27;s master had bequeathed him &quot;the task of keeping the tradition of Transcendental Meditation alive&quot; and that &quot;the Maharishi&#x27;s commercial mantras drew criticism from stricter Hindus, but his promises of better health, stress relief and spiritual enlightenment drew devotees from all over the world&quot;. Paul McCartney commented, saying that &quot;Whilst I am deeply saddened by his passing, my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly for the people of the world and the cause of unity.&quot;

===Legacy===

The Maharishi left a legacy that includes the revival of India&#x27;s ancient spiritual tradition of meditation, which he made available to everyone. He is considered responsible for the popularisation of meditation in the west, something he accomplished by teaching Transcendental Meditation worldwide through a highly effective organization of his own development. The Maharishi is also credited with &quot;the proposal of the existence of a unique or fourth state of consciousness with a basis in physiology&quot; and the application of scientific studies to research on the physiological effects of Transcendental Meditation and the development of higher states of consciousness, areas previously relegated to mysticism. Partly because of this, &quot;Newsweek&quot; credited him with helping to launch &quot;a legitimate new field of neuroscience&quot;. According to &quot;The Times of India,&quot; his &quot;unique and enduring contribution to humankind was his deep understanding of – and mechanics of experiencing – pure consciousness&quot;. A memorial building, the Maharishi Smarak, was inaugurated at Allahabad in February 2013.

==Philosophy and teaching==
The Maharishi had come out to teach with the &quot;avowed intention&quot; to change &quot;the course of human history&quot;. When he first began teaching, he had three main aims: to revive the spiritual tradition in India, to show that meditation was for everyone and not just for hermits, and to show that Vedanta is compatible with science. The Maharishi had a message of happiness, writing in 1967 that &quot;being happy is of the utmost importance. Success in anything is through happiness. Under all circumstances be happy. Just think of any negativity that comes at you as a raindrop falling into the ocean of your bliss&quot;. His philosophy featured the concept that &quot;within everyone is an unlimited reservoir of energy, intelligence, and happiness&quot;. He emphasised the naturalness of his meditation technique as a simple way of developing this potential.

Beginning in 1962, the Maharishi began to recommend the daily practice of yoga exercises or asanas to accelerate growth further.

He also taught that practising Transcendental Meditation twice a day would create inner peace and that &quot;mass meditation sessions&quot; could create outer peace by reducing violence and war. According to a TM website, the performance of yagyas by 7,000 pandits in India, plus hundreds of Yogic Flyers in Germany, brought &quot;coherence and unity in the collective consciousness of Germany&quot; and caused the fall of the Berlin Wall. One religion scholar, Michael York, considers the Maharishi to have been the most articulate spokesman for the spiritual argument that a critical mass of people becoming enlightened through the practice of &quot;meditation and yogic discipline&quot; will trigger the New Age movement&#x27;s hoped-for period of postmillennial &quot;peace, harmony, and collective consciousness&quot;. Religious studies scholar Carl Olson writes that the TM technique was based on &quot;a neo-Vedanta metaphysical philosophy in which an unchanging reality is opposed to an ever-changing phenomenal world&quot; and that the Maharishi says it is not necessary to renounce worldly activities to gain enlightenment, unlike other ascetic traditions.

According to author Jack Forem, the Maharishi stated that the experience of transcendence, which resulted in a naturally increasing refinement of mind and body, enabled people to behave in more correct ways naturally. Thus, behavioral guidelines did not need to be issued and were best left to the teachings of various religions: &quot;It is much easier to raise a man&#x27;s consciousness than to get him to act righteously,&quot; the Maharishi said.

Some religious studies scholars have further said that Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is one of a number of Indian gurus who brought neo-Hindu adaptations of Vedantic Hinduism to the West. Author Meera Nanda calls neo-Hinduism &quot;the brand of Hinduism that is taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Deepak Chopra, and their clones&quot;. J. R. Coplin, a sociologist and MIU graduate, says that the Maharishi saw his own purpose as &quot;the &#x27;revival&#x27; of the knowledge of an integrated life based upon Vedic principles and Vedantist reality&quot;.

Author Barry Miles writes that, despite the media&#x27;s skepticism for the Maharishi&#x27;s spiritual message, they seized upon him because young people seemed to listen to his pro-establishment, anti-drug message, with one TM participant saying the Maharishi &quot;signaled the beginning of the post-acid generation.&quot;

===Transcendental Meditation===

During a CNN interview in 2002, the Maharishi said, &quot;Transcendental Meditation is something that can be defined as a means to do what one wants to do in a better way, a right way, for maximum results.&quot; His movement offered in-residence style TM advanced courses. By the time of his death, there were nearly 1,000 TM training centers around the world.

The Maharishi is credited with having contributed to the Western world a meditation technique that is both simple and systematic, as well as introducing the scientific study of meditation.

In the mid-1970s, the Maharishi began the TM-Sidhi programme, which included Yogic Flying as an additional option for those who had been practicing the Transcendental Meditation technique for some time. According to Coplin, this new aspect of knowledge emphasized not only the individual but also the collective benefits created by the group practice of this advanced program. This new program gave rise to a new principle called the &quot;Maharishi Effect&quot;, which is said to &quot;create coherence in the collective consciousness&quot; and to suppress crime, violence, and accidents.

===Maharishi Vedic Science===
 Maharishi Vedic Science (MVS) is based on the Maharishi&#x27;s interpretation of the ancient Vedic texts based on his master, Brahmananda Saraswati&#x27;s teachings. MVS aims to put forward traditional Vedic literature in the light of Western traditions of knowledge and understanding. According to Roy Ascott, MVS also explains the potential for every human being to experience the infinite nature of transcendental consciousness, also defined as Being or Self, while engaged in normal activities of daily life. Once this state is fully established, outer aspects of existence no longer influence an individual and perceives pure consciousness in everything. MVS includes two aspects: the practical aspect of the Transcendental Meditation technique and the TM-Sidhi program and the theoretical aspect of how MVS is applied to day-to-day living. These applications include programs in: Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health (MVAH); Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, a mathematical system for the design and construction of buildings; Maharishi Gandharva Veda, a form of classical Indian music; Maharishi Jyotish (also known as Maharishi Vedic Astrology), a system claiming the evaluation of life tendencies of an individual; Maharishi Vedic Agriculture, a trademarked process for producing fresh, organic food; and Consciousness-Based Education. According to educator James Grant, a former Maharishi University of Management Associate Professor of Education and the former Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, Maharishi brought out a &quot;full revival of the Vedic tradition of knowledge from India&quot; and demonstrated its relevance in many areas, including education, business, medicine and government.

===Publications===
The Maharishi wrote more than twenty books on the Transcendental Meditation technique and Maharishi Vedic Science.

====&quot;The Beacon Light of the Himalayas&quot;====
In 1955, the organizers of the Great Spiritual Development Conference of Kerala published &quot;The Beacon Light of the Himalayas&quot;, a transcribed 170-page &quot;souvenir&quot; of the conference. Authors Chryssides, Humes and Forsthoefel, Miller, and Russel cite this as the Maharishi&#x27;s first published book on Transcendental Meditation, but Transcendental Meditation is not mentioned in the book&#x27;s text. The book is dedicated to Maharshi Bala Brahmachari Mahesh Yogi Rajaram by his devotees of Kerala and contains photographs, letters and lectures by numerous authors, which appear in various languages, such as English, Hindi and Sanskrit.

====&quot;Science of Being and Art of Living&quot;====
In 1963, the Maharishi audiotaped the text of the book &quot;Science of Being and Art of Living&quot;, which was later transcribed and published in fifteen languages. 
K.T. Weidmann describes the book as the Maharishi&#x27;s fundamental philosophical treatise, in which its author provides an illustration of the ancient Vedic traditions of India in terms that can be easily interpreted and understood by the scientific thinking of the Western world. In the &quot;Science of Being&quot;, the Maharishi illustrates the concepts of relative existence as the experience of everyday reality through one&#x27;s senses, absolute reality as the origin of being, and the source of all creative intelligence. The Maharishi describes this absolute reality, or Being, as unchanging, omnipresent, and eternal. He also identifies it with bliss consciousness. The two aspects of reality, the relative and the absolute, are like an ocean with many waves. The waves represent the relative, and the ocean beneath is the foundation of everything, or Being. Establishing oneself in the field of Being, or unchanging reality, ensures stability.

In his &quot;Science of Being&quot;, the Maharishi introduced an additional concept: that of fulfillment viewed as something to be obtained not through exertion or self-effort but through the progressive settling of the mind during the practice of TM. This was the first complete systematic description of the principles underlying the Maharishi&#x27;s teachings.

====&quot;Bhagavad-Gita: A New Translation and Commentary&quot;: 1967====
In his 1967 publication, &quot;Bhagavad-Gita: A New Translation and Commentary&quot;, the Maharishi describes the Bhagavad Gita as &quot;the Scripture of Yoga&quot;. He says that &quot;its purpose is to explain in theory and practice all that is needed to raise the consciousness of man to the highest possible level.&quot; According to Peter Russell, the Bhagavad-Gita deals with the concept of loss of knowledge and subsequent revival, and the Maharishi himself brings this out in the introduction. In the Preface, the Maharishi writes: &quot;The purpose of this commentary is to restore the fundamental truths of the Bhagavad-Gita and thus restore the significance of its teaching. If this teaching is followed, effectiveness in life will be achieved, men will be fulfilled on all levels and the historical need of the age will be fulfilled also.&quot;

A second concept, that of freedom, presented as the antithesis of fear, is also prevalent in the book, according to Jack Forem. Forem states that in his interpretation of the Gita, the Maharishi expressed several times that as man gains greater awareness through the practice of Transcendental Meditation, he gradually establishes a level of contentment which remain increasingly grounded within him and in which the mind does not waver and is not affected by either attachment or fear.

==Characterizations and criticism==
The Maharishi was reported to be a vegetarian, an entrepreneur, a monk, and &quot;a spiritual man who sought a world stage from which to espouse the joys of inner happiness.&quot; He was described as an abstemious man with tremendous energy who took a weekly day of silence while sleeping only two hours per night. He did not present himself as a guru or claim his teachings as his own. Instead, he taught &quot;in the name of his guru Brahmananda Saraswati&quot; and paid tribute to him by placing a picture of Saraswati behind him when he spoke. He was on a mission to bring the ancient techniques of TM to the world. Scientist and futurist Buckminster Fuller spent two days with the Maharishi at a symposium at the University of Massachusetts in 1971 and said, &quot;You could not meet with Maharishi without recognizing instantly his integrity.&quot; Authors Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley write that the Maharishi did not claim any &quot;special divine revelation nor supernatural personal qualities&quot;. Still others said he helped to &quot;inspire the anti-materialism of the late 60s&quot; and received good publicity because he &quot;opposed drugs&quot;. According to author Chryssides, &quot;The Maharishi tended to emphasize the positive aspects of humanity, focusing on the good that exists in everyone.&quot;

According to &quot;The Times&quot;, the Maharishi attracted skepticism because of his involvement with wealthy celebrities, his business acumen, and his love of luxury, including touring in a Rolls-Royce. A reporter for &quot;The Economist&quot; calls this a &quot;misconception,&quot; saying: &quot;He did not use his money for sinister ends. He neither drank, nor smoked, nor took drugs. ... He did not accumulate scores of Rolls-Royces, like Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh; his biggest self-indulgence was a helicopter. &quot; When some observers questioned how his organisation&#x27;s money was being used, the Maharishi said, &quot;It goes to support the centres, it does not go on me. I have nothing.&quot; However, when the Maharishi died in 2008, he left behind an estate worth an estimated $300 million (U.S.). He was survived by four nephews, who inherited 12,000 acres of land in India, and Tony Nader, a Lebanese neuroscientist whom he had anointed as his successor in the movement. Since his death, several memoirs have been written by former followers and their children who described the Maharishi as a cult leader who could be controlling, and his Centers a financial business.

He was often called the &quot;Giggling Guru&quot; because of his habit of laughing during television interviews. Slightly over five feet tall, the Maharishi often wore a traditional cotton or silk, white dhoti while carrying or wearing flowers. He often sat cross-legged on a deerskin and had a &quot;grayish-white beard, mustache and long, dark, stringy hair&quot;. Barry Miles described the Maharishi as having &quot;liquid eyes, twinkling but inscrutable with the wisdom from the East&quot;. Miles said the Maharishi in his seventies looked much younger than his age. He had a high pitched voice and in the words of Merv Griffin, &quot;a long flowing beard and a distinctive, high pitched laugh that I loved to provoke&quot;.

Biographer Paul Mason&#x27;s website says that Swami Swaroopananda, one of three claimants to the title Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math, is &quot;an outspoken critic&quot; of the Maharishi. According to Swaroopananda, the Maharishi &quot;was responsible for the controversy over Shankaracharyas&quot; because he gave Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand encouragement and assistance in fighting the court case which challenged Shantanand&#x27;s inheritance of the title. In a review of the documentary film &quot;David Wants to Fly&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine reported Swaroopananda&#x27;s assertion that &quot;as a member of the trader caste&quot; the Maharishi &quot;has no right to give mantras or teach meditation&quot;. According to religious scholar Cynthia Humes, enlightened individuals of any caste may &quot;teach brahmavidya&quot; and author Patricia Drake writes that &quot;when Guru Dev was about to die he charged Maharishi with teaching laymen ... to meditate&quot;. Mason says Shantanand &quot;publicly commended the practice of the Maharishi&#x27;s meditation&quot; and sociologist J.R. Coplin says that Shantanand&#x27;s successor, Swami Vishnudevanand, also &quot;speaks highly of the Maharishi.&quot;

===In popular culture===
The British satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; ridiculed him as &quot;Veririchi Lotsamoney Yogi Bear&quot;. The Maharishi was also parodied by comedians Bill Dana and Joey Forman in the 1968 comedy album &quot;The Mashuganishi Yogi&quot;, by actor Cash Oshman in the film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, by comedian Mike Myers in the film &quot;The Love Guru&quot;, and in the BBC sketch show &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot;. He was portrayed by actor Gerry Bednob in the 2007 film &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot;.

==Controversies==
===Sexual misconduct===
While the Beatles were in Rishikesh, allegations of sexual improprieties by the Maharishi in his ashram were circulated. John Lennon later cited a rumour that the Maharishi made sexual advances on Mia Farrow and &quot;a few other women&quot; during their time at the ashram, later writing the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot;, in which John Lennon characterized the Maharishi as a fraud. George Harrison and Cynthia Lennon later denied that the Farrow event took place and stayed within the TM movement, while Farrow maintains that the Maharishi made sexual advances towards her during a private meditation session.

In the 2010 documentary &quot;David Wants to Fly&quot;, a former personal assistant and &quot;skinboy&quot; of the Maharishi recounts bringing women to the Maharishi&#x27;s room, claiming he has &quot;no question in my mind that he had sex with the women.&quot; In the same film, another assistant, Judith Bourque, details how the Maharishi had sex with her multiple times over the course of two years before moving on to other women, with instructions including &quot;don&#x27;t tell anyone&quot; and, in the case of her becoming pregnant, to &quot;get married quick&quot;. Bourque later elaborated and substantiated her claims with evidence (including photos, notes, and dated letters from the Maharishi) in the autobiographical book &quot;Robes of Silk, Feet of Clay&quot;, including additional allegations that the Maharishi had at least sixteen other mistresses during her two years of traveling with him.

===Pseudoscience===
Since early in the TM movement, the Maharishi made claims of pseudoscientific supernatural abilities (called &quot;sidhis&quot; or the TM-Sidhi program) that can be obtained through TM meditation, including levitation (yogic flying), invisibility, and invulnerability. The &quot;magical claims&quot; of the TM-Sidhis program and the Maharishi Effect created a crisis for the movement’s image and began a period of media controversy. In 2014, a meta-analysis of meditation research found &quot;insufficient evidence that mantra meditation programs [such as TM] had an effect on any of the psychological stress and well-being outcomes&quot;. However, a different meta-analysis study, also published in 2014 by David Orme-Johnson of the TM-affiliated Maharishi University of Management, found that &quot;TM practice is more effective than treatment as usual and most alternative treatments, with greatest effects observed in individuals with high anxiety.&quot;

Despite the Maharishi&#x27;s claims that his movement was not a religion but &quot;scientific&quot;, TM initiation since his time has begun with a Hindu puja worship ritual performed by the teacher and his movement has received criticism from Hindus for selling &quot;commercial mantras&quot; of the Sanskrit names of Hindu-Vedic gods. Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge writes that the Maharishi taught a &quot;highly simplified form of Hinduism, adapted for Westerners who did not possess the cultural background to accept the full panoply of Hindu beliefs, symbols, and practices.&quot;

On top of criticism that TM is a &quot;form of Hinduism that doesn&#x27;t acknowledge its roots&quot;, a 1978 federal court ruling in New Jersey declared TM to be a religion. Further allegations state that the Maharishi presented TM as areligious so that it could be taught in US public schools and other tax-funded institutions.

===World government===
Since the 1970s, the Maharishi began planning a new world government based on his TM teachings, including meetings with world leaders such as Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau to discuss his plans. On Larry King Live, the Maharishi made anti-democratic statements and announced plans for a monarchic world government, including, &quot;I believe in God. And I believe in the custody of God vested in kings&quot; and &quot;I want to establish a government in every country [...] I used to say &#x27;damn the democracy&#x27; because it&#x27;s not a stable government.&quot;

The Maharishi crowned key members of his movements as the &quot;rajas&quot; (kings) of his Global Country of World Peace, including Tony Nader as the &quot;maharaja&quot; (great king) and &quot;First Sovereign Ruler of the Global Country of World Peace.&quot; It has been reported that the &quot;rajas&quot; of the TM movement must pay $1 million to receive &quot;spiritual dominion&quot; over a country in accordance with &quot;natural law&quot;. In 1992, the Maharishi&#x27;s Natural Law Party was listed on the presidential ballot in several states in the USA, with physicist and &quot;raja&quot; John Hagelin as the presidential nominee.

==Other initiatives, projects and programmes==

Maharishi International University (renamed Maharishi University of Management (MUM) in 1995), the first university the Maharishi founded, began classes in Santa Barbara, California, in 1973. In 1974 the university moved to Fairfield, Iowa, where it remains. The university houses a library of the Maharishi&#x27;s taped lectures and writings, including the thirty-three-lesson Science of Creative Intelligence course, originally a series of lectures given by the Maharishi in Fiuggi, Italy, in 1972. Described in the MUM university catalogue as combining modern science and Vedic science, the course also defines certain higher states of consciousness, and gives guidance on how to attain these states. Though the university claims to grant PhDs, including in neuroscience and psychology, the university is not accredited by either the America Psychological Association (APA) or the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.
The Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools (MVMS), an educational system established in sixteen Indian states and affiliated with the New Delhi Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), was founded in 1995 by the Maharishi. It has 148 branches in 118 cities with 90,000 to 100,000 students and 5,500 teaching and support staff.

In 1998, Maharishi Open University was founded by the Maharishi. It was accessible via a network of eight satellites broadcasting to every country in the world, and via the Internet.

The Maharishi also introduced theories of management, defence, and government programmes designed to alleviate poverty, and introduced a new economic development currency called the Raam. In 2000, the Maharishi began building administrative and teaching centres called &quot;Peace Palaces&quot; around the world, and by 2008 at least eight had been constructed in the US alone. The Maharishi Institute, an African university that is part of a group of schools around the world that are named after him, was founded in 2007 and uses his Transcendental Meditation technique in their teaching.

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, in his farewell message on 11 January 2008, announced the establishment of the Brahmananda Saraswati Trust (BST), named in honour of his teacher, to support large groups totalling more than 30,000 peace-creating Vedic Pandits in perpetuity across India. The Patron of the Brahmanand Saraswati Trust is the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math.

===Organizations and businesses===
The Maharishi is credited with heading charitable organisations, for-profit businesses, and real estate investments whose total value has been estimated at various times, to range from 2 to 5 billion. The real estate alone was valued in 2003 at between $3.6 and $5 billion. Holdings in the United States, estimated at $250 million in 2008, include dozens of hotels, commercial buildings and undeveloped land. The Maharishi &quot;amassed a personal fortune that his spokesman told one reporter may exceed $1 billion&quot;. According to a 2008 article in &quot;The Times&quot;, the Maharishi &quot;was reported to have an income of six million pounds&quot;. The Maharishi&#x27;s movement is said to be funded through donations, course fees for Transcendental Meditation and various real estate transactions.

In his biography of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, The Story of the Maharishi (published 1976), William Jefferson suggests that the financial aspect of the TM organisation was one of the greatest controversies it faced. Questions were raised about the Maharishi&#x27;s mission, comments from leaders of the movement at that time, and fees and charges the TM organisation levied on followers. Jefferson says that the concerns with money came from journalists more than those who have learned to meditate.

<text>Molde Fotballklubb () is a football club based in Molde, Norway, that competes in Eliteserien, the top flight of Norwegian football. Founded on 19 June 1911, the club was originally known as International and changed its name to Molde in 1915. Molde are five-time league champions (2011, 2012, 2014, 2019 and 2022) and six-time Norwegian Cup winners (1994, 2005, 2013, 2014, 2022 and 2023), and have finished second in the league a further eleven times. Molde is one of only two Norwegian clubs to have participated in the UEFA Champions League.

The club&#x27;s home matches are played at the 11,249-capacity Aker Stadion. The stadium was inaugurated in 1998, and was a gift from local businessmen Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten. The club was formerly based at Molde stadion, which hosted the club&#x27;s record attendance of 14,615. Molde&#x27;s supporter club is called &quot;Tornekrattet&quot; (&quot;Thicket of thorns&quot;, a reference to the city&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Town of Roses&quot;) and was founded after the 1994 Norwegian Cup final victory. Molde has its strongest rivalry with Rosenborg.

Until the beginning of the 1970s, the club mainly played in local lower division leagues, except for a short visit in the Hovedserien in the 1957–58 season. In 1974, Molde was back in the top division and finished second in the league, and have since then become one of Norway&#x27;s leading clubs and generally stayed in the top division. Molde also finished second in the league in 1987, when the club lost the championship to Moss in the decisive match of the season.

During the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, Molde was the second-best team in Norway (behind 13-times in a row champions Rosenborg), with league silver medals in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2002, and cup championships in 1994 and 2005, as well as participation in the UEFA Champions League in the 1999–2000 season, when Real Madrid, Porto and Olympiacos visited Molde.

As of 2017, the club has approximately 1,000 members and around 55 teams in three departments. Erling Moe has been manager of the club since the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjær in December 2018; he has been permanent head coach since 29 April 2019.

==History==
===Early years (1911–63)===
Molde FK was founded on 19 June 1911 by a group gathered by Klaus Daae Andersen (born 30 September 1873); they named J. Ferdinand Dahl as the inaugural chairman. On a general election on 24 April 1912, it was decided that the club would be named International, perhaps because the opponents were primarily visitors from cruise ships or trading vessels, or that it was to make room for the many Danes who worked in the Gideon engine factory. The same year, on 5 August, the club played its first competitive match, an away match against Kristiansund which ended 2–2. The rising interest and activity in football in neighbouring towns caused the club to change its name to Molde Fotballklubb in 1915. The club played its first season in the top division in 1939–40, but the season was abandoned due to the German occupation and was never completed. In the first post-war season in 1947–48, Molde were relegated from the top flight.

===The breakthrough (1964–77)===
On 2 August 1964, Molde shocked nine-time Norwegian Cup champions and nine-time Norwegian League Champions Fredrikstad by eliminating them from the 1964 Norwegian Cup in the third round with a 3–2 win at home. Jan Fuglset, Torkild Brakstad and Harry Hestad, amongst others, played at Molde during that period. The club played in local lower leagues, save for a short visit in the top division in the 1957–58 season. In 1970, Molde was promoted to the second tier and played there for three seasons until its promotion to the top flight with a 5–1 away win against Sogndal on 16 September 1973.

In 1974, Molde returned to the premier division following the debut of several talented players in the first team, which coincided with the return of top level players like Fuglset, Brakstad and Hestad. Molde surprised the established clubs in their first season of the 1. divisjon, leading the league in 9 of 22 matchdays. Ahead of the final match of the season, Molde would win the league if they defeated Sarpsborg and Viking lost against Strømsgodset. However, both Molde and Viking won their last match, meaning Molde won the silver medal after finishing one point behind champions Viking.

Since then, Molde has generally stayed in the top division and has become one of Norway&#x27;s leading clubs. The club has produced a respectable number of national team players, and players who have gone professional in foreign leagues.

===Ups and downs (1978–93)===
Between 1978 and 1984, Molde did not play on the same level in two consecutive years. Molde was relegated from the 1. divisjon in every even-numbered year, and promoted to back to the first tier in every odd-numbered year, making it three consecutive promotions and relegations. In fact, Molde and Brann did not play at the same level these years, as Brann were promoted when Molde was relegated and the other way around.

In 1982, Molde played in their first cup final, despite being relegated from the 1982 1. divisjon. They lost the final at Ullevaal Stadion 3–2 against Brann.

The 1987 season was the closest Molde came to winning the league championship before winning it in 2011, when a draw at home against Moss in the final round would have ensured the title. Despite numerous goal scoring opportunities, Moss won the match 2–0 at Molde stadium, thus winning the league championship, while Molde won their second silver medal. The attendance of 14,615 set the record at the old Molde stadion.

Molde played their second cup final in 1989. The first match against Viking ended in a 2–2 draw, and the subsequent replay was won 2–1 by Viking.

When Molde again was relegated from the Norwegian top flight in 1993, the club was in major economic difficulties following a number of projects, the most notably of which was an extension of the main stand at Molde stadion. Local businessmen Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten started to invest in the club, and since 1993 they have invested approximately on old debts, new players and the new stadium.

===The silver generation (1994–2000)===
Åge Hareide was the main coach of Molde in 1994, when they finished second in their 1. divisjon group and was thus re-promoted to Tippeligaen. Molde also met their main rivals Rosenborg in the semi-final of the 1994 Norwegian Cup, and with 4–3 win on aggregate, Molde qualified for their third cup final. After having lost to Molde, Rosenborg head coach Nils Arne Eggen called Molde&#x27;s playing style &quot;arse-football&quot; (&quot;rævvafotball&quot;). Molde won their first title by defeating Lyn 3–2 at Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo.
During the 1995 season, Molde became known for their three strikers: Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Arild Stavrum and Ole Bjørn Sundgot. In their first league match, Molde won 6–0 against Brann in Bergen, with Solskjær scoring two goals and Stavrum and Sundgot also contributing in one of Brann&#x27;s heaviest-ever losses at home. With six-straight wins, Molde stayed in the top two positions of the league throughout the season, but eventually finished second, 15 points behind Rosenborg.

Solskjær scored 31 goals in 42 matches for Molde and was sold to Manchester United on 29 July 1996 as Molde finished in eighth position that season. In 1997, Molde finished fourth in the league, and Erik Brakstad replaced Åge Hareide as head coach ahead of the 1998 season.

In 1998, Molde played their first 21 matches without losing, a Norwegian record until 2009, when Rosenborg went 26 matches undefeated. In the 22nd round, Molde lost against Vålerenga while Rosenborg defeated Kongsvinger to surpass Molde at the top of the table. Rosenborg player Mini Jakobsen subsequently said, &quot;It was fun as long as you managed to keep up. Thank you for helping to create tension in the Premier League!&quot; On 26 September 1998, Rosenborg won 2–0 against Molde in the 23rd round and won the championship, with Molde settling for second place.

In 1999, Molde had a successful season, finishing second in the league and reaching the semi-final of the 1999 Norwegian Cup, where they were eliminated by Brann. Molde also participated in the UEFA Champions League, where Molde was drawn against CSKA Moscow in the second qualifying round. In the first match in Moscow, Molde lost 2–0, while in the second leg, 19-year-old Magne Hoseth had his big break-through with two goals when CSKA was defeated 4–0 to send Molde to the third qualifying round, where they met Mallorca. The first leg against Mallorca ended 0–0 at home. Away at Mallorca were Molde one goal behind for a long time, but Andreas Lund became the big hero when he equalized on a penaltyin the 84th minute. With a 1–1 aggregate score, Molde qualified for the group stage on away goals, and Molde became the team from the smallest city to have qualified for the group stage of Champions League until Unirea Urziceni repeated the feat in 2009–10. In the group stage, Molde were drawn against Real Madrid, Porto and Olympiacos, and with one win and five losses, Molde finished last in their group. On the occasion of Molde&#x27;s 100-year anniversary in 2011, the readers of the local newspaper &quot;Romsdals Budstikke&quot; voted 1999 as the best year in the history of the club.

===From &quot;Gunder method&quot; to relegation (2001–2006)===
On 6 November 2000, after the sacking of Erik Brakstad, Gunder Bengtsson was announced head coach for two years. After one season, Bengtsson and his assistant Kalle Björklund were signed for three more years. In 2002, Gunder Bengtsson led Molde to second place in the league, but like when he won the league with Vålerenga in 1983 and 1984, there was not much enthusiasm around the club&#x27;s sixth silver medal because of the defensive tactics and lack of local players in the squad.

In the first six matches of the 2003 season, Molde collected five points. On 22 May 2003, Bengtsson was fired and replaced by Odd Berg. In the third round of 2003 Norwegian Cup, Molde were eliminated by second-tier club Skeid. Despite the change in the coaching staff, Molde was struggling in the relegation zone throughout the season, but after a 3–2 win away against Sogndal in the last match of the season, Molde avoided the relegation playoffs. In 2004, the team led by Reidar Vågnes, former assistant coach under Erik Brakstad, but Molde only managed 11th place, four points clear of relegation.

In 2005, Bo Johansson became head coach of Molde, and on 15 June 2005, Molde won 3–2 against Nybergsund to qualify for the fourth round of the Norwegian Cup, having lost in the third round for three consecutive years. Molde finished 12th in the league and had to play in the relegation playoff against Moss, which Molde won 5–2 on aggregate. Molde won their second Norwegian Cup title on 6 November 2005 when they won 4–2 after extra time against Lillestrøm in the final. Bo Johansson left Molde after only one season with the club, and on Christmas Eve, Arild Stavrum was announced as the new head coach.

Following the Norwegian Cup champions, Molde played in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup. On 25 August 2006, they were drawn to face Scottish giants Rangers in the first round. They were eliminated 2–0 on aggregate after holding Rangers to a 0–0 draw at the Aker Stadion. The same year, Molde was relegated, having been in the relegation zone for the last four seasons. The relegation became final after losing 8–0 against Stabæk at Nadderud in the second-last match of the season. Arild Stavrum was fired at the end of the season.

===A new era (2007–present)===
In December 2006, Kjell Jonevret became head coach after Stavrum was fired, though Ove Christensen was the club&#x27;s first choice. With Jonevret as coach, Molde won the 2007 1. divisjon and was again promoted back to the top flight. After the promotion to Tippeligaen, Molde recorded a 5–1 win against Vålerenga on the last day of Moldejazz 2008, as well as eliminating Brann from the cup with an impressive 8–0 win at home four days later. Regardless of these strong results, Molde finished ninth in their comeback season in the top flight.

In the 2009 season, Molde was again the second-best team in Norway, behind champions Rosenborg, who that season overtook Molde&#x27;s 1998 unbeaten streak record. Conversely, Molde ruined Rosenborg&#x27;s march for a possible double with a 5–0 win at Aker Stadion in the quarter-final of the 2009 Norwegian Cup. In the final, Molde met their local rivals Aalesunds FK, where Aalesund won the Norwegian Championship on penalty shoot-out after the score ended 2–2 after extra time. After collecting only 20 points during the first 22 matches in the 2010 Tippeligaen, Jonevret was sacked and replaced by Uwe Rösler. Under Röslers management, Molde collected 20 points in the last eight matches and avoided relegation. Despite the poor performance by the team, Baye Djiby Fall, who spent the season on loan from Lokomotiv Moscow, became the first Molde player since Jan Fuglset in 1976 to be the top goalscorer in Eliteserien.

Prior to the club&#x27;s 100-year anniversary in 2011, former Molde and Manchester United player Ole Gunnar Solskjær returned to Molde to manage the club. In the opening match of 2011 Tippeligaen, his first competitive match, Molde lost 3–0 away against newly promoted Sarpsborg 08. On 19 June 2011, Molde celebrated their anniversary with a 2–0 win against Sogndal and positioned themselves at the top of the league table. Molde was leading the league until they eventually won their first championship on 30 October 2011, when Rosenborg, the only team that could mathematically have still beaten them to first place with two matches remaining, lost 6–3 at home to Brann. Molde successfully defended their title in 2012 by beating Hønefoss 1–0 on 11 November, with one match remaining in the season. Although Molde could only finish sixth behind champions Strømgodset in the 2013 Tippeligaen, they defeated Rosenborg 4–2 in the 2013 Norwegian Cup final on 24 November to win the Norwegian Cup for the third time in their history. Ole Gunnar Solskjær left the club to sign for Premier League side Cardiff City on 2 January 2014.

Under new manager Tor Ole Skullerud, Molde won their first domestic league and cup double in 2014, however Skullerud was fired in August 2015 due to a run of mediocre results and Solskjær (whose run at Cardiff lasted just nine months) was brought back to the team. On 19 December 2018 Solskjær left the club to join Manchester United as caretaker manager, with club director Øystein Neerland stating that Solskjær left on a loan deal for the remainder of the season. However, Solskjær was signed permanently by Manchester United in March 2019 and Molde&#x27;s caretaker manager Erling Moe got the manager job on a permanent basis on 29 April. Moe led Molde to their fourth league title in his first full season in charge.

==Kit==
Molde&#x27;s club colours are blue shirts, white shorts and white socks, which has become the standard Molde FK home kit. Molde&#x27;s traditional away colours are the same as for the home kit, but in the opposite order; white shirts, blue shorts and blue socks. All-blue home kits and all-white away kits have been common for Molde to use in European games.

Molde&#x27;s first shirt sponsor, Opel, agreed for the 1980 season. Following that, several short-term deals was made before a long-term deal was signed with G-Sport in 1992. In 1999, Molde ended their contract with G-Sport and were sponsored by Commit for three seasons. Sparebanken Møre became their shirt sponsor in 2003, a deal first renewed in 2007 worth NOK 20 million over a five-year period. In 2016, the club once again renewed their sponsorship with the savings bank, signing a deal until 2019. In February 2020, Molde and Sparebanken Møre announced that they had agreed to a deal until the end of the 2022 season.

For twelve years in the beginning of the 21st century, from 2002 to the end of 2013, Molde&#x27;s shirts were supplied by Umbro. In December 2013, Molde signed a four-year deal with Nike starting January 2014.
===Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors===
== Stadiums ==

Molde&#x27;s current stadium is the Aker Stadion, formerly known as Molde Stadion, located at Reknes, by the seashore of central Molde. The cost was mostly paid for by investor Kjell Inge Røkke, after whom the ground has been nicknamed &quot;Røkkeløkka&quot;. The official name of the new stadium was Molde Stadion until 3 May 2006, when the stadium name changed to Aker Stadion following a sponsorship deal with Røkke&#x27;s company Aker. The stadium was inaugurated on 18 April 1998, when the stadium was officially opened by Prime Minister and Molde fan Kjell Magne Bondevik. In the opening match, Molde defeated Lillestrøm 4–0 in their first home match of the season, attracting 13,010 spectators. Tommy Berntsen scored the first goal on Aker Stadion with an own goal, while Daniel Berg Hestad was the first Molde player to score a goal at the new stadium. The all-time attendance record was set on 26 September when Molde hosted Rosenborg in front of 13,308 people. When Molde qualified for the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League group stage, the stadium was converted to an all-seater, with seats being installed on the lower sections of the short end stands. This reduced the attendance capacity permanently because the club chose not to remove the seats afterwards. Today the capacity of Aker Stadion is 11,249.

Before moving to Aker Stadion in the beginning of the 1998 season, Molde had been playing their home matches at Molde Idrettspark (at the time called Molde stadion), a municipal-owned multi-use venue, since 1955. Molde Idrettspark was inaugurated on 28 August 1955, when Kristiansund was defeated 1–0. About 2,500 spectators attended the inaugural match. The first top-tier league match was played here on 28 July 1957, when Molde managed a 1–1 draw against Sandefjord in the first round of 1957–58 Norwegian Main League. When Molde earned a promotion to the 1974 1. divisjon, the main stand was expanded. The unsurpassed record attendance at Molde Idrettspark is 14,615 in a match against Moss in 1987. Today, Molde Idrettspark is used by Træff and Molde 2.

==Support==

<text>Vojvodina ( ; , ), officially the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, is an autonomous province that occupies the northernmost part of Serbia, located in Central Europe. It lies within the Pannonian Basin, bordered to the south by the national capital Belgrade and the Sava and Danube Rivers. The administrative centre, Novi Sad, is the second-largest city in Serbia.

The historic regions of Banat, Bačka, Syrmia and northernmost part of Mačva overlap the province. Modern Vojvodina is multi-ethnic and multi-cultural, with some 26 ethnic groups and six official languages. Less than two million people, nearly 27% of Serbia&#x27;s population, live in the province.

==Name==
&quot;Vojvodina&quot; is also the Serbian word for voivodeship, a type of duchy overseen by a voivode. The Serbian Voivodeship, a precursor to modern Vojvodina, was an Austrian province from 1849 to 1860.

Its official name is the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. Its name in the province&#x27;s six official languages is:
* Serbian: / ()
* Hungarian: 
* Croatian: 
* Pannonian Rusyn: ()
* Slovak: 
* Romanian: 

==History==
===Pre-Roman times and Roman rule===
In the Neolithic period, two important archaeological cultures flourished in this area: the Starčevo culture and the Vinča culture. Indo-European peoples first settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in 3200 BC. During the Eneolithic period, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, several Indo-European archaeological cultures were centered in or around Vojvodina, including the Vučedol culture, the Vatin culture, and the Bosut culture, among others.

Before the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of Illyrian, Thracian and Celtic origin inhabited this area. The first states organized in this area were the Celtic State of the Scordisci (3rd century BC-1st century AD) with capital in Singidunum (Belgrade), and the Dacian Kingdom of Burebista (1st century BC).

During Roman rule, Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica) was one of the four capital cities of the Roman Empire, and six Roman Emperors were born in this city or in its surroundings. The city was also the capital of several Roman administrative units, including Pannonia Inferior, Pannonia Secunda, the Diocese of Pannonia, and the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum.

Roman rule lasted until the 5th century, after which the region came into the possession of various peoples and states. While Banat was a part of the Roman province of Dacia, Syrmia belonged to the Roman province of Pannonia. Bačka was not part of the Roman Empire and was populated and ruled by Sarmatian Iazyges.

===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===
After the Romans were driven away from this region, various Indo-European and Turkic peoples and states ruled in the area. These peoples included Goths, Sarmatians, Huns, Gepids and Avars. For regional history, the largest in importance was a Gepid state, which had its capital in Sirmium. According to the 7th-century &quot;Miracles of Saint Demetrius&quot;, Avars gave the region of Syrmia to a Bulgar leader named Kuber circa 680. The Bulgars of Kuber moved south with Maurus to Macedonia where they co-operated with Tervel in the 8th century.

Slavs settled today&#x27;s Vojvodina in the 6th and 7th centuries, before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the Balkans. Slavic tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Vojvodina included Abodrites, Severans, Braničevci and Timočani.

In the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the Bulgarian Empire, Great Moravia and Ljudevit&#x27;s Pannonian Duchy. During the Bulgarian administration (9th century), local Bulgarian dukes, Salan and Glad, ruled over the region. Salan&#x27;s residence was Titel, while that of Glad was possibly in the rumoured rampart of Galad or perhaps in the Kladovo (Gladovo) in eastern Serbia. Glad&#x27;s descendant was the duke Ahtum, another local ruler from the 11th century who opposed the establishment of Hungarian rule over the region.

In the village of Čelarevo archaeologists have also found traces of people who practised the Judaic religion. Bunardžić dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in Čelarevo, containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th and 9th centuries. Erdely and Vilkhnovich consider the graves to belong to the Kabars who eventually broke ties with the Khazar Empire between the 830s and 862. (Three other Khazar tribes joined the Magyars and took part in the Magyar conquest of the Carpathian basin including what is now Vojvodina in 895–907.)

===Hungarian rule===

Following territorial disputes with Byzantine and Bulgarian states, most of Vojvodina became part of the Kingdom of Hungary between the 10th and 12th century and remained under Hungarian administration until the 16th century (Following periods of Ottoman and Habsburg administrations, Hungarian political dominance over most of the region was established again in 1867 and over entire region in 1882, after abolition of the Habsburg Military Frontier).

The regional demographic balance started changing in the 11th century when Magyars began to replace the local Slavic population. But from the 14th century, the balance changed again in favour of the Slavs when Serbian refugees fleeing from territories conquered by the Ottoman army settled in the area. Most of the Hungarians left the region during the Ottoman conquest and early period of Ottoman administration, so the population of Vojvodina in Ottoman times was predominantly Serbs (who comprised an absolute majority of Vojvodina at the time), with significant presence of Muslims of various ethnic backgrounds.

===Ottoman rule===
After the defeat of the Kingdom of Hungary at Mohács by the Ottoman Empire, the region fell into a period of anarchy and civil wars. In 1526 Jovan Nenad, a leader of Serb mercenaries, established his rule in Bačka, northern Banat and a small part of Syrmia. He created an ephemeral independent state, with Subotica as its capital.

At the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself Serbian Emperor in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. Emperor Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed. After the fall of emperor&#x27;s state, the supreme military commander of Jovan Nenad&#x27;s army, Radoslav Čelnik, established his own temporary state in the region of Syrmia, where he ruled as Ottoman vassal.

A few decades later, the whole region was added to the Ottoman Empire, which ruled over it until the end of the 17th and the first half of the 18th century, when it was incorporated into the Habsburg monarchy. The Treaty of Karlowitz of 1699, between Holy League and Ottoman Empire, marked the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces from Central Europe, and the supremacy of the Habsburg monarchy in that part of the continent. According to the treaty, the western part of Vojvodina passed to Habsburgs. The eastern part (eastern Syrmia and Province of Tamışvar) remained in Ottoman hands until Austrian conquest in 1716. This new border change was ratified by the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718.

===Habsburg rule===
====Hungarian Crown land (1699–1849)====
During the Great Serb Migration, Serbs from Ottoman territories settled in the Habsburg monarchy at the end of the 17th century (in 1690). Most settled in what is now Hungary, with the lesser part settling in western Vojvodina. All Serbs in the Habsburg monarchy gained the status of a recognized nation with extensive rights, in exchange for providing a border militia (in the Military Frontier) that could be mobilized against invaders from the south (such as the Ottomans), as well as in case of civil unrest in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. Wallachian Right became the point of reference in the 18th century for military settlement in lowland region. The Vlachs who settled there were actually mainly Serbs, although there were also Romanians while Aromanians lived in the urban areas.

At the beginning of Habsburg rule, most of the region was integrated into the Military Frontier, while western parts of Bačka were put under civil administration within the County of Bač. Later, the civil administration was expanded to other (mostly northern) parts of the region, while southern parts remained under military administration. The eastern part of this area was held again by the Ottoman Empire between 1787 and 1788, during the Russo-Turkish War. In 1716, Vienna temporarily forbade settlement by Hungarians and Jews in the area, while large numbers of German speakers were settled in the region from Bavaria and southern areas, in order to repopulate it and develop agriculture. From 1782, Protestant Hungarians and ethnic Germans settled in larger numbers.
During the 1848–49 revolutions, Vojvodina was a site of a war between Serbs and Hungarians, due to the opposite national conceptions of the two peoples. At the May Assembly in Sremski Karlovci (13–15 May 1848), Serbs declared the constitution of the &quot;Serbian Voivodship&quot; (&quot;Serbian Duchy&quot;), a Serbian autonomous region within the Austrian Empire. The Serbian Voivodship consisted of Srem, Bačka, Banat, and Baranja.

The head of the metropolitanate of Sremski Karlovci, Josif Rajačić, was elected patriarch, while Stevan Šupljikac was chosen as first voivod (duke). The ethnic war erupted violently in the area, with both sides committing atrocities against the civilian populations.

====Austrian Crown land (1849–1860)====

Following the Habsburg-Russian and Serb victory over the Hungarians in 1849, a new administrative territory was created in the region in November 1849, in accordance with a decision made by the Austrian emperor. By this decision, the Serbian autonomous region created in 1848 was transformed into the new Austrian crown land known as Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar. It consisted of Banat, Bačka and Srem, excluding the southern parts of these regions which were part of the Military Frontier with significant Serbian populations. An Austrian governor seated in Temeschwar ruled the area, while the title of Voivod belonged to the emperor himself. The full title of the emperor was &quot;Grand Voivod of the Voivodship of Serbia&quot; (German: &quot;Großwoiwode der Woiwodschaft Serbien&quot;). German and Serbian were the official languages of the crown land. In 1860, the new province was abolished and most of it (with exception of Syrmia) was again integrated into the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.

===Hungarian rule===

====Hungarian Crown land (1860–1867)====
Vojvodina remained Austrian Crown land until 1860, when Emperor Franz Joseph decided that it would be Hungarian Crown land again. After 1867, the Kingdom of Hungary became one of two self-governing parts of Austria-Hungary, and the territory was returned again to Hungarian administration.

====Counties in the Kingdom of Hungary (1867–1920)====

In 1867, a new county system was introduced. This territory was organized among Bács-Bodrog, Torontál and Temes counties. The era following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 was a period of economic flourishing. The Kingdom of Hungary had the second-fastest growing economy in Europe between 1867 and 1913, but ethnic relations were strained. According to the 1910 census, the last census conducted in Austria-Hungary, the population of Vojvodina included 510,754 (33.8%) Serbs; 425,672 (28.1%) Hungarians; and 324,017 (21.4%) Germans.

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===
At the end of World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed. On 29 October 1918, Syrmia became a part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 31 October 1918, the Banat Republic was proclaimed in Timișoara. The government of Hungary recognized its independence, but it was short-lived.

On 25 November 1918, the Great People&#x27;s Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs in Banat, Bačka and Baranja in Novi Sad proclaimed the unification of Vojvodina (Banat, Bačka and Baranja) with the Kingdom of Serbia (The assembly numbered 757 deputies, of which 578 were Serbs, 84 Bunjevci, 62 Slovaks, 21 Rusyns, 6 Germans, 3 Šokci, 2 Croats and 1 Hungarian). One day before this, on 24 November, the Assembly of Syrmia also proclaimed the unification of Syrmia with Serbia. On 1 December 1918, Vojvodina (as part of the Kingdom of Serbia) officially became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.
Between 1929 and 1941, the region was part of the Danube Banovina, a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Its capital city was Novi Sad. Apart from the core territories of Vojvodina and Baranja, it included significant parts of Šumadija and Braničevo regions south of the Danube (but not the capital city of Belgrade).

===World War II and immediate aftermath===
Between 1941 and 1944, during World War II, Nazi Germany and its allies, Hungary and the Independent State of Croatia, occupied Vojvodina and divided it. Bačka and Baranja were annexed by Hungary and Syrmia was included in the Independent State of Croatia. A smaller Danube Banovina (including Banat, Šumadija, and Braničevo) was designated as part of the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia. The administrative center of this smaller province was Smederevo. But, Banat was a separate autonomous region ruled by its ethnic German minority.

The occupying powers committed numerous crimes against the civilian population, especially against Serbs, Jews and Roma; the Jewish population of Vojvodina was almost completely killed or deported. In total, Axis occupational authorities killed about 50,000 citizens of Vojvodina (mostly Serbs, Jews and Roma) while more than 280,000 people were interned, arrested, violated or tortured. Such crimes in varying regions of Vojvodina were carried out by Nazi Germans, Ustaše and Hungarian Axis forces. Many historians and authors describe the Ustashe regime&#x27;s mass killings as genocide of the Serbs, including Raphael Lemkin. In 1942, in the Novi Sad Raid, a military operation carried out by the Királyi Honvédség, the armed forces of Hungary, during World War II, after occupation and annexation of former Yugoslav territories. It resulted in the deaths of 3,000–4,000 civilians in the southern Bačka (Bácska) region. Under the Hungarian authority, 19,573 people were killed in Bačka, of which the majority of victims were of Serb, Jewish and Romani origin.
When Axis occupation ended in 1944, the region was temporarily placed under a military administration (1944–45) run by the new communist authorities. During and after the military administration, several thousands of citizens were killed. Victims were mostly ethnic Germans, but Hungarian and Serb populations were also killed. Both the war-time Axis occupational authorities and the post-war communist authorities ran concentration/prison camps in the territory of Vojvodina (see List of concentration and internment camps). While war-time prisoners in these camps were mostly Jews, Serbs and communists, post-war camps were formed for ethnic Germans (historically known as Danube Swabians).

Most Vojvodina ethnic Germans (about 200,000) fled the region in 1944, together with the defeated German army. Most of those who remained in the region (about 150,000) were sent to some of the villages cordoned off as prisons. It is estimated that some 48,447 Germans died in the camps from disease, hunger, malnutrition, mistreatment, and cold. Some 8,049 Germans were killed by partisans during military administration in Vojvodina after October 1944.

It has also been estimated that post-war communist authorities killed some 15,000–20,000 Hungarians and some 23,000–24,000 Serbs during Communist purges in Serbia in 1944–45. According to Dragoljub Živković, some 47,000 ethnic Serbs were murdered in Vojvodina between 1941 and 1948. About half were killed by occupational Axis forces and the other half by the post-war Communist authorities.

The region was politically restored in 1944 (incorporating Syrmia, Banat, Bačka and Baranja) and became an autonomous province of Serbia in 1945. Instead of the previous name (Danube Banovina), the region regained its historical name of Vojvodina, while its capital city remained Novi Sad. When the final borders of Vojvodina were defined, Baranja was assigned to Croatia, while the northern part of the Mačva region was assigned to Vojvodina.

===Socialist Yugoslavia===
For decades, the province enjoyed only a small level of autonomy within Serbia. Under the 1974 Yugoslav constitution, it gained extensive rights of self-rule, as both Kosovo and Vojvodina were given &quot;de facto&quot; veto power in the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments. Changes to their status could not be made without the consent of the two Provincial Assemblies.

The 1974 Serbian constitution, adopted at the same time, reiterated that &quot;the Socialist Republic of Serbia comprises the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo, which originated in the common struggle of nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in the National Liberation War (the Second World War) and socialist revolution&quot;.
In 1990s, during the war in Croatia in persecution of Croats in Serbia during Yugoslav Wars was organized and participated in the expulsion of the Croats in some places in Vojvodina. Based on an investigation by the &quot;Humanitarian Law Fund&quot; from Belgrade in the course of June, July, and August 1992, more than 10,000 Croats from Vojvodina exchanged their property for the property of Serbs from Croatia, and altogether about 20,000 Croats left Serbia. According to other estimations, the number of Croats which have left Serbia under political pressure of Milošević&#x27;s regime might be between 20,000 and 40,000. According to Petar Kuntić of Democratic Alliance of Croats in Vojvodina, 50,000 Croats were pressured to move out from Serbia during the Yugoslav wars.

Under the rule of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević, a series of protests against Vojvodina&#x27;s party leadership took place during the summer and autumn of 1988, which forced it to resign. Eventually Vojvodina and Kosovo had to accept Serbia&#x27;s constitutional amendments that practically dismissed the autonomy of the provinces in Serbia. Vojvodina and Kosovo lost elements of statehood in September 1990 when the new constitution of the Republic of Serbia was adopted.

Vojvodina was still referred to as an autonomous province of Serbia, but most of its autonomous powers – including, crucially, its vote on the Yugoslav collective presidency – were transferred to the control of Belgrade, the capital. The province still had its own parliament and government, and some other autonomous functions as well. According to Đorđe Tomić, this is an example of a phantom border.

===Contemporary period===

The fall of Milošević in 2000 created a new political climate in Vojvodina. Following talks between the political parties, the level of the province&#x27;s autonomy was somewhat increased by the omnibus law in 2002. The Vojvodina provincial assembly adopted a new statute on 15 October 2008, which, after being partially amended, was approved by the Parliament of Serbia.

On 28 January 2013, as an answer to the proposal of the Third Serbia political organization from Novi Sad to abolish the autonomy of Vojvodina, the pro-autonomist Vojvodina&#x27;s Party performed a campaign that involved the posting of &quot;Republic of Vojvodina&quot; posters in Novi Sad.

==Geography==
Vojvodina is situated in the northern quarter of Serbia, in Central Europe. In the southeast part of the Pannonian Plain, the plain that remained when the Pliocene &quot;Pannonian Sea&quot; dried out. As a consequence of this, Vojvodina is rich in fertile loamy loess soil, covered with a layer of chernozem. The region is divided by the Danube and Tisa rivers into: Bačka in the northwest, Banat in the east and Syrmia (Srem) in the southwest. A small part of the Mačva region is also located in Vojvodina south of the Sava river, in the Srem District.

Today, the western part of Syrmia is in Croatia, the northern part of Bačka is in Hungary, the eastern part of Banat is in Romania (with a small piece in Hungary), while Baranja (which is between the Danube and the Drava) is in Hungary and Croatia. Vojvodina has a total surface area of . Vojvodina is also part of the Danube-Kris-Mures-Tisa euroregion.

<text>Physical geodesy is the study of the physical properties of Earth&#x27;s gravity and its potential field (the geopotential), with a view to their application in geodesy.

==Measurement procedure==
Traditional geodetic instruments such as theodolites rely on the gravity field for orienting their vertical axis along the local plumb line or local vertical direction with the aid of a spirit level. After that, vertical angles (zenith angles or, alternatively, elevation angles) are obtained with respect to this local vertical, and horizontal angles in the plane of the local horizon, perpendicular to the vertical.

Levelling instruments again are used to obtain geopotential differences between points on the Earth&#x27;s surface. These can then be expressed as &quot;height&quot; differences by conversion to metric units.

===Units===

Gravity is commonly measured in units of m·s−2 (metres per second squared). This also can be expressed (multiplying by the gravitational constant G in order to change units) as newtons per kilogram of attracted mass.

Potential is expressed as gravity times distance, m2·s−2. Travelling one metre in the direction of a gravity vector of strength 1 m·s−2 will increase your potential by 1 m2·s−2. Again employing G as a multiplier, the units can be changed to joules per kilogram of attracted mass.

A more convenient unit is the GPU, or geopotential unit: it equals 10 m2·s−2. This means that travelling one metre in the vertical direction, i.e., the direction of the 9.8 m·s−2 ambient gravity, will &quot;approximately&quot; change your potential by 1 GPU. Which again means that the difference in geopotential, in GPU, of a point with that of sea level can be used as a rough measure of height &quot;above sea level&quot; in metres.

==Gravity==
==Potential fields==
==Geoid==
Due to the irregularity of the Earth&#x27;s true gravity field, the equilibrium figure of sea water, or the geoid, will also be of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks out as much as 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Sri Lanka, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. 
The separation between the geoid and the reference ellipsoid is called the &quot;undulation of the geoid&quot;, symbol formula_1.

The geoid, or mathematical mean sea surface, is defined not only on the seas, but also under land; it is the equilibrium water surface that would result, would sea water be allowed to move freely (e.g., through tunnels) under the land. Technically, an &quot;equipotential surface&quot; of the true geopotential, chosen to coincide (on average) with mean sea level.

As mean sea level is physically realized by tide gauge bench marks on the coasts of different countries and continents, a number of slightly incompatible &quot;near-geoids&quot; will result, with differences of several decimetres to over one metre between them, due to the dynamic sea surface topography. These are referred to as &quot;vertical datums&quot; or &quot;height datums&quot;.

For every point on Earth, the local direction of gravity or vertical direction, materialized with the plumb line, is &quot;perpendicular&quot; to the geoid (see astrogeodetic leveling).

== Gravity anomalies ==

Above we already made use of &quot;gravity anomalies&quot; formula_2. These are computed as the differences between true (observed) gravity formula_3, and calculated (normal) gravity formula_4. (This is an oversimplification; in practice the location in space at which γ is evaluated will differ slightly from that where &quot;g&quot; has been measured.) We thus get

:formula_5

These anomalies are called free-air anomalies, and are the ones to be used in the above Stokes equation.

In geophysics, these anomalies are often further reduced by removing from them the &quot;attraction of the topography&quot;, which for a flat, horizontal plate (Bouguer plate) of thickness &quot;H&quot; is given by

:formula_6

The Bouguer reduction to be applied as follows:

:formula_7

so-called Bouguer anomalies. Here, formula_8 is our earlier formula_2, the free-air anomaly.

In case the terrain is not a flat plate (the usual case!) we use for &quot;H&quot; the local terrain height value but apply a further correction called the terrain correction.

<doc id="176822" wikidata="Q323168" url="?curid=176822" title="Parker–Hulme murder case">
<text>The Parker–Hulme murder case was the murder of Honorah Mary Rieper (also known as Honorah Mary Parker) in Christchurch, New Zealand, on 22 June 1954. The perpetrators were Rieper&#x27;s teenage daughter Pauline Parker and her friend Juliet Hulme. Parker was 16 at the time, while Hulme was 15.

The murder received wider public attention following the release of Peter Jackson&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Heavenly Creatures.&quot;

==Background==
Pauline Yvonne Parker (also known as Pauline Rieper) was born on 26 May 1938. She met Juliet Hulme when they were both in their early teens. Parker came from a working-class background. Her parents were part-time house staff and gardeners, employed by the University of Canterbury. Her father, Herbert Rieper, and her mother, Honorah Mary Parker, were living together but were not actually married; this was not public knowledge and was only revealed at the trial.

Juliet Hulme was born in London in 1938 and emigrated to New Zealand in 1948 with her parents. She was the daughter of Henry Hulme, a physicist who became the rector of University of Canterbury. The university provided their accommodation and the family lived at Ilam Homestead. Both Hulme and Parker attended Christchurch Girls&#x27; High School. The girls had both suffered illnesses as children, Parker with osteomyelitis and Hulme with tuberculosis, which formed the basis of an initial connection. 

As their friendship developed, Parker and Hulme formed an elaborate fantasy life together. They wrote plays, books, and stories centred in this world. The girls had an intense friendship which caused concern in Parker&#x27;s parents that they were engaged in a sexual relationship; homosexuality at the time was considered a mental illness. The Hulmes also had concerns, but both families continued to allow the girls to see one another, and Parker was accepted at the Hulme home in Ilam for overnights and vacations. Hulme became withdrawn and ill when Parker would leave her home without her.

During their relationship, the girls invented their own personal religion, with their own ideas on morality. They rejected Christianity and worshipped their own saints, envisioning a parallel dimension called The Fourth World, essentially their version of Heaven. The Fourth World was a place that they felt they were already able to enter occasionally, during moments of spiritual enlightenment. By Parker&#x27;s account, they had achieved this spiritual enlightenment because of their friendship.

Parker was not invited to go to Ilam over the summer holidays in 1953 as she had been in previous years. In 1954, Hulme&#x27;s parents separated. Problems with faculty and the board forced Hulme’s father to resign from his position as rector of the university, and her mother was involved in an extramarital affair. Hulme&#x27;s family planned to return to England, but it was decided that Hulme herself would be sent to live with relatives in South Africa—ostensibly for her health.

Both girls were heartbroken over their upcoming separation and decided that Parker should go to South Africa as well. They thought the Hulmes would agree to this plan. Parker was certain her mother would not allow her to go with Hulme. The girls formed a plan to murder Parker&#x27;s mother in order to remove their perceived obstacle in them remaining together. Their long term plan was to go to South Africa and then head to Hollywood or New York City, where they believed they would publish their writing and work in film.

==Murder==
On the afternoon of 22 June 1954, Parker and Hulme had afternoon tea with Parker&#x27;s mother, Honorah Rieper, in a tea kiosk in Victoria Park, Christchurch. Following their meal they walked through a wooded area of the park approximately down the path, where Hulme and Parker bludgeoned Rieper to death with half of a brick enclosed in an old stocking. After committing the murder, the two girls ran back to the tea kiosk. They were met by Agnes and Kenneth Ritchie, owners of the tea shop, whom they told that Rieper had fallen and hit her head.

Rieper&#x27;s body was discovered in Victoria Park by Ritchie. Major lacerations were found about her head, neck, and face, with minor injuries to her fingers. Police soon discovered the murder weapon in the nearby woods. The girls&#x27; story of Rieper&#x27;s accidental death quickly fell apart.

==Trial and conviction==
Prior to the trial, Parker had been known as Pauline Rieper. Her mother had been living with her father, Herbert Rieper, but the police investigations revealed that they were not, in fact, married. Thus, during the trial, both Honorah and Pauline were referred to with the surname &quot;Parker&quot;.

The trial was a sensational affair, with speculation about the girls&#x27; possible lesbianism and insanity. Parker and Hulme were convicted on 28 August 1954; and, as they were too young to be considered for the death penalty, each spent five years in prison. Hulme served her sentence at Mount Eden prison in Auckland. Some sources say they were released on condition that they never contact each other again, but Sam Barnett, then Secretary for Justice, told journalists there was no such condition. Hulme&#x27;s release was unconditional, and she immediately rejoined her father in Italy, while Parker was placed on six months&#x27; parole in New Zealand, after which she left the country.

Less than four months later, the murder was taken as strong evidence of moral decline by the Special Committee on Moral Delinquency in Children and Adolescents in what became known as the Mazengarb Report, named after Ossie Mazengarb, who chaired the committee.

==Release==
===Pauline Parker===
Following her release from prison, Parker was given a new identity as Hilary Nathan, and spent some time in New Zealand under close surveillance before being allowed to leave for England. From at least 1992, she was living in the small village of Hoo, near Strood, Kent, and running a children&#x27;s riding school. As an adult, she became a devout Roman Catholic. While she has never spoken to the press, she expressed strong remorse, in a 1996 statement released through her sister, for having killed her mother. Her sister further stated that &quot;[Pauline] committed the most terrible crime and has spent 40 years repaying it by keeping away from people and doing her own little thing ... After it happened, she was very sorry about it. It took her about five years to realize what she had done.&quot;

===Juliet Hulme===
After her release from prison, Hulme spent time in England and the United States, later settling in Scotland and becoming a successful historical detective novelist under her new name, Anne Perry. She had been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since about 1968. Until 1994, it was not well-known that Perry was Hulme. In March 2006, Hulme/Perry stated that, while her relationship with Parker was obsessive, they were not lesbians.

Hulme/Perry died on 10 April 2023, at the age of 84.

<doc id="176824" wikidata="Q650167" url="?curid=176824" title="Babson College">
<text>Babson College is a private business school in Wellesley, Massachusetts, United States. It was established in 1919 by Roger W. Babson as an all-male business institute and became coeducational in 1970.

== History ==
===20th century===
On September 3, 1919, with an enrollment of twenty-seven students, the Babson Institute held its first classes in the former home of Roger and Grace Babson on Abbott Road in Wellesley Hills. The Institute provided intensive training in the fundamentals of production, finance and distribution in one academic year.

The institute&#x27;s curriculum focused on practical experience. Students worked on group projects and class presentations, observed manufacturing processes during field trips to area factories and businesses, met with managers and executives, and viewed industrial films on Saturday mornings.

The institute also maintained a business environment as part of the students&#x27; everyday life. The students, required to wear professional attire, kept regular business hours and were monitored by punching in and out on a time clock. They were also assigned an office desk equipped with machines standard at the time. Personal secretaries typed the students&#x27; assignments and correspondence in an effort to accurately reflect the business world. Roger Babson aimed to &quot;prepare his students to enter their chosen careers as executives, not anonymous members of the work force.&quot;

In 1969, Babson converted its three-year Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree into a four-year Bachelor of Science degree. That same year, the institute became a college, and women were admitted for the first time.

===21st century===
Babson is involved in a three-college collaboration with Olin College and Wellesley College, often called BOW.

==Campus==

The main residential campus of Babson College is and located in the &quot;Babson Park&quot; section of Wellesley, Massachusetts, fifteen miles west of Boston.

==Academics==
===Undergraduate program===
Babson College offers a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. Students can choose from 24 concentrations in business and other fields during their junior and senior years. Programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the college itself has been institutionally accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education or its predecessor since 1950.

===Graduate program===
The F.W. Olin Graduate School of Business at Babson College offers a one-year MBA Program, a two-year MBA Program, a 42-month evening MBA Program and a blended learning MBA Program with campuses located in Boston, San Francisco and Miami. It also offers a Master&#x27;s of Science in Entrepreneurial Leadership, Business Analytics, Finance, and a Certificate of Advanced Management.

=== Rankings and reputation ===

Babson&#x27;s undergraduate school and MBA program have been ranked #1 by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for entrepreneurship for several consecutive decades.

In 2025, Babson ranked #2 on &quot;The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s&quot; best colleges. It is the #1 business school on &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; list of colleges with the highest earning graduates. Because Babson only offers programs in business administration, many publications do not include the college in their overall rankings.

==Student life==

Student publications include a literary magazine and the &quot;Babson Built Podcast&quot;. There are several fraternities and sororities on campus. Babson College Radio was started in 1998.

==Athletics==
Babson&#x27;s teams are known as the &quot;Beavers&quot; and its colors are green and white. The school has 23 varsity sports teams, the majority of which compete in the New England Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) of the NCAA Division III. Babson&#x27;s Baseball team has won 7 Conference Championships and been to 5 NCAA Tournaments, including the 2019 College World Series. Additionally, the men&#x27;s soccer team have won 3 NCAA National Championships, 27 NCAA tournaments wins and 12 conference championships. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s alpine ski teams compete in the United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association (USCSA) and the men&#x27;s lacrosse team competes in the Pilgrim League. Babson College&#x27;s men&#x27;s hockey team competes in the New England Hockey Conference (formerly called the ECAC East) and has won (1) NCAA D3 National title, (1) ECAC 2 title, six ECAC East Championships, appearing in the championship game in 12 of the last 20 seasons . Babson College&#x27;s men&#x27;s golf team competes in the New England Collegiate Conference (NECC) and won the title in 2011. Babson United Rugby Club won Northeast region of NSCRO 7&#x27;s in 2016. In March 2017, Babson&#x27;s basketball team won the Division III National Championship.

<doc id="176826" wikidata="Q2161599" url="?curid=176826" title="Roger Babson">
<text>Roger Ward Babson (July 6, 1875 – March 5, 1967) was an American entrepreneur, economist, and business theorist in the first half of the 20th century. He is best remembered for founding Babson College. He also founded Webber College, now Webber International University, in Babson Park, Florida, and the defunct Utopia College, in Eureka, Kansas.

Babson was born to Nathaniel Babson and his wife Ellen Stearns as part of the 10th generation of Babsons to live in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Roger attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked for investment firms before founding Babson&#x27;s Statistical Organization (1904), which analyzed stocks and business reports; it continues today as Babson-United, Inc.

== Work on financial theory ==
Babson&#x27;s success as an investor was based on unorthodox views of the operation of markets. According to his biographer John Mulkern, Babson attributed the business cycle &quot;to Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s law of action and reaction... (with a) pseudoscientific notion that gravity can be used to explain movement in the stock markets.&quot; His market forecasting techniques are expounded in articles in &quot;Traders World Magazine&quot; and the Gravity Research Foundation he founded.

He graduated from MIT with a degree in engineering. As a college student, he lobbied the dean to include a business course, which resulted in a course known as &quot;Business Engineering.&quot; Eventually, the business engineering program was expanded, and it is now seen as the forerunner of the MBA degree.

Babson authored more than 40 books on economic and social problems, the most widely read being &quot;Business Barometers&quot; (eight editions) and &quot;Business Barometers for Profits, Security, Income&quot; (10 editions). Babson also wrote hundreds of magazine articles and newspaper columns. He was a popular lecturer on business and financial trends.

Babson was an investor and sometimes director of many corporations, including some traded on the New York Stock Exchange. He established the investment advisory company &quot;Babson&#x27;s Reports&quot;, which published one of the first investment newsletters in the U.S.

=== Babson&#x27;s Ten Commandments of Investing ===
Babson had &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; he followed in investing and encouraged his readers to do the same. These were:
# Keep speculation and investments separate.
# Don&#x27;t be fooled by a name.
# Be wary of new promotions.
# Give due consideration to market ability.
# Don&#x27;t buy without proper facts.
# Safeguard purchases through diversification.
# Don&#x27;t try to diversify by buying different securities of the same company.
# Small companies should be carefully scrutinized.
# Buy adequate security, not super abundance.
# Choose your dealer and buy outright (don&#x27;t buy on margin).

===Forecast of Wall Street Crash===
On September 5, 1929, Babson gave a speech to the National Business Conference at Babson College, in which he proclaimed, &quot;More people are borrowing and speculating today than ever in our history. Sooner or later a crash is coming, and it may be terrific&quot;. Speaking at a time when expectations of a continuing boom economy were high, Babson&#x27;s prescient advice was &quot;wise are those investors who now get out of debt and reef their sails. This does not mean selling all you have, but it does mean paying up your loans and avoiding margin speculation&quot;.

Later that day, the stock market declined by about 3%. This became known as the &quot;Babson Break.&quot; The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression soon followed.

=== Role in development of Andrews Pitchfork ===
Babson learned to draw a nominal line through zigzagging market action on charts from George F. Swain, a Professor of Engineering, when he worked with him, and he later taught this technique to Alan H. Andrews, who further refined it into &quot;Andrews Pitchfork,&quot; a now-commonly used trendline indicator.

== Political career ==
Babson was the Prohibition Party&#x27;s candidate for President of the United States in 1940. The election was won by incumbent President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the Democratic Party. Babson was surpassed by two other unsuccessful candidates:
* Wendell Lewis Willkie of the Republican Party
* Norman Mattoon Thomas of the Socialist Party of America

== Role in development of the parking meter ==
In the late 1920s, Babson filed several patents for a parking meter. The meters were suggested to operate on power from the battery of the parking vehicle and required a connection from the vehicle to the meter. In 1932, Carl Magee began to work on the parking meter and since his parking meter was the first to be installed for actual use in July 1935 in Oklahoma City, Magee is known as the inventor of the parking meter.

== Establishment of the Gravity Research Foundation ==
Babson founded the Gravity Research Foundation in 1948. The Foundation established a research facility in the town of New Boston, New Hampshire after Babson determined that this location was far enough away from the city of Boston, Massachusetts to survive a nuclear attack.

== Interest in Isaac Newton ==

Throughout Babson&#x27;s life, he had a strong interest in Isaac Newton, especially after learning how &quot;Newton had combined the practical with the theoretical,&quot; similar to how Babson applied Newton&#x27;s third law to finance. Babson&#x27;s wife, Grace Babson, also had a strong interest in Newton, collecting much of Newton&#x27;s work in a variety of translations, editions, and commentaries over many years. At the time, it was much easier to amass a large collection of scientific writing as book collectors valued them much less than in later years. Following some financial success, Grace was able to pursue her collection even further, later amounting to over 1,000 editions of Newton materials, being the largest source in the United States. In 1995, the Babson College collection was placed on loan to MIT&#x27;s Burndy Library, and in 2006, to the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, where it is available for scholarly research.

Between Sir Isaac Newton Library (now known as Tomasso Hall) and the Lunder Admission Center lay descendants of the original apple trees that had purportedly inspired Newton&#x27;s idea of gravity. Grace also saved the parlor of Newton&#x27;s last residence before its demolition and created a replica in Babson Park.

== The &quot;Babson Boulders&quot; of Dogtown, Massachusetts ==

Babson was interested in the history of an abandoned settlement in Gloucester known as Dogtown. To provide charitable assistance to unemployed stonecutters in Gloucester during the Great Depression, Babson commissioned them to carve inspirational inscriptions on approximately two dozen boulders in the area surrounding Dogtown Common. The Babson Boulder Trail exists today as a well-known hiking and mountain-biking trail. The inscriptions are clearly visible. The boulders are scattered, not all are on the trail, and not all of the inscriptions face it, making finding them something of a challenge.

<doc id="176827" wikidata="Q615160" url="?curid=176827" title="White Christmas (weather)">
<text>A white Christmas is a Christmas with the presence of snow, either on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day, depending on local tradition. The phenomenon is most common in the northern countries of the Northern Hemisphere. This is because December is at the beginning of the Southern Hemisphere summer, and so white Christmases there are extremely rare - with the exception being Antarctica, the Southern Alps of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, and parts of the Andes in South America.

==History==
The notion of &quot;white Christmas&quot; was popularized by writings of Charles Dickens. The depiction of snow-covered Christmas season found in &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1836), &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843), and his short stories was apparently influenced by memories of his childhood, which coincided with the coldest decade in England in more than a century.
The song, &quot;White Christmas&quot;, written by Irving Berlin and sung by Bing Crosby (with the Ken Darby singers and John Scott Trotter and his orchestra) and featured in the 1942 Paramount Pictures film &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;, is the best-selling single of all time and speaks nostalgically of a traditional white Christmas and has since become a seasonal standard.

== Definition ==
The criteria for a &quot;white Christmas&quot; varies. In most countries, it simply means that the ground is covered by snow at Christmas, but some countries have more strict definitions. In the United States, the official definition of a white Christmas is that there has to be a snow depth of at least on the ground on 25 December in the contiguous United States, and in Canada the official definition is that there has to be more than on the ground on Christmas Day. In the United Kingdom, although for many a white Christmas simply means a complete covering of snow on Christmas Day, the official definition by the British Met Office and British bookmakers is for snow to be observed falling, however little (even if it melts before it reaches the ground), in the 24 hours of 25 December. Consequently, according to the Met Office and British bookmakers, even of snow on the ground at Christmas, because of a heavy snow fall a few days before, will not constitute a white Christmas, but a few snowflakes mixed with rain will, even if they never reach the ground. In the United Kingdom the most likely place to see snowfall on a Christmas Day is in North and North Eastern Scotland, in Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire or the Highlands.

Although the term &quot;white Christmas&quot; usually refers to snow, if a significant hail accumulation occurs in an area on Christmas Day, as happened in parts of Melbourne on 25 December 2011, this can also be described as a white Christmas, due to the resulting white appearance of the landscape resembling snow cover.

== By country ==
=== Croatia ===
In recent decades, white Christmases in Zagreb have been observed in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001 andmost recently, as of 2018in 2007. The probability of white Christmas in Zagreb has been estimated at 25%.

In continental Croatia, the estimated probability of white Christmas is highest in Gorski Kotar and Lika (50-70%), followed by northwestern Croatia (40-60%) and Slavonia (20-40%). Climate projections suggest white Christmases in Croatia might become rarer in the future.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, the prospect of early winter snow is always remote due to the country&#x27;s mild and wet climate (snowfall is most common in January and February). Bookmakers offer odds every year for a white Christmas, which is officially lying snow being recorded at 09:00 local time on Christmas Day, and recorded at either Dublin Airport or Cork Airport (bets are offered for each airport).

Since 1961, countrywide, snow has &quot;fallen&quot; on 17 Christmas Days (1961, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1970, 1980, 1984, 1990, 1993, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2009 and 2010), with nine of these having snow &quot;lying on the ground&quot; at 09:00 (1964, 1970, 1980, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2010). The maximum amount of lying snow ever recorded on Christmas Day was at Casement Aerodrome in 2010.

At Dublin Airport, there have been 12 Christmas Days with snowfall since 1941 (1950, 1956, 1962, 1964, 1970, 1984, 1990, 1993, 1995, 1999, 2000 and 2004). The statistical likelihood of snow falling on Christmas Day at Dublin Airport is approximately once every 5.9 years. However, the only Christmas Day at the airport ever to have lying snow at 09:00 was 2010 (although no snow actually fell that day), with recorded.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
In most parts of Canada it is likely to have a white Christmas in most years, except for the coast and southern interior valleys of British Columbia, southern Alberta, southern Ontario, and parts of Atlantic Canada – in those places Christmas without snow is not uncommon in warmer years, with the British Columbia coast the least likely place to have a white Christmas. The definition of a white Christmas in Canada is of snow-cover or more on Christmas morning at 7 am. Environment Canada started to analyze data from 1955 to 2017 for a total of 63 years, It shows the chance of a White Christmas for several Canadian cities.

The year 2006 saw some of the warmest weather on record, with such places as Quebec City experiencing their first green Christmas in recorded history. In 2008, Canada experienced the first nationwide white Christmas in 37 years, as a series of pre-Christmas storms hit the nation, including the normally rainy BC Pacific coast. In 2015, the weather was mild in the east, with record-setting warm temperatures in Toronto and southern Ontario which made 2015 a green Christmas while the west saw cold and snowy weather.

==== United States ====

In the United States, there is often—but not always—snow on the ground at Christmas in the northern states, except in the Pacific Northwest, with Alaska the most likely to see snow on the ground at Christmas. In the contiguous United States, the highest probabilities are in the Upper Midwest and parts of northern New England, along with higher elevations of the Rockies. Some of the least likely white Christmases that have happened include the 2004 Christmas Eve Snowstorm, which brought the first white Christmas in 50 years to New Orleans. The 2004 storm also brought the first measurable snow of any kind since 1895 to Brownsville, Texas, and its twin city of Matamoros, Mexico. The Florida winter storm of 1989 also occurred immediately before Christmas causing a white Christmas for cities like Pensacola and Jacksonville. The same storm buried Wilmington, North Carolina and the rest of southeastern North Carolina under of snow.

In the United States the notion of a white Christmas is often associated in the American popular consciousness with a Christmas celebration that includes traditional observances in the company of friends and family. &quot;White Christmas&quot; is an Irving Berlin song reminiscing about an old-fashioned Christmas setting.

According to research by the CDIAC, the United States during the second half of the 20th century experienced declining frequencies of white Christmases, especially in the northeastern region. The National Climatic Data Center based the probability of a white Christmas ( of snow on the ground) at selected cities upon the 1981–2010 numbers from stations with at least 25 years of data.

==== Tables for North America ====


=== Poland ===

The last white Christmas in Kraków was in 2010. Rzeszów had a white Christmas in 2016, the first since 2011.

=== Romania ===

White Christmases in Romania have been rare in recent times, and this is likely to continue due to the geographic position of Romania and climate change. In recent years, blizzard and snow falls usually start in January and they usually end at the beginning of March. However, at high altitudes, white Christmases are common.
=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, white Christmases were more common from the 1550s to the 1850s, during the Little Ice Age; the last frost fair on the River Thames, however, was in the winter of 1813–14. The shift from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1752 also slightly reduced the chance of a white Christmas, by moving Christmas earlier in the winter.

Before 2006 for betting purposes, a Met Office employee was required to record if any snow fell on the London Weather Centre over the 24 hours of Christmas Day; after 2006 computers were used. An &quot;official&quot; white Christmas is defined by the Met Office as &quot;one snowflake to be observed falling in the 24 hours of 25 December somewhere in the UK&quot;, but formerly the snow had to be observed at the Met Office building in London. By the newer measure, over half of all years have white Christmases, with snow being observed 38 times in the 54 years A more &quot;traditional&quot; idea of snow-covered ground is less common, however, with only 4 occasions in the 51 years reporting snow on the ground at 9am at more than 40% of weather stations.

Although most places in the UK do tend to see some snow in the winter, it generally falls in January and February. However white Christmases do occur, on average every 6 years.

Christmas 2009 was a white Christmas in some parts of Britain, with thick lying snow which easterly winds had brought over the previous week. Travel over much of Britain was badly affected by ice and snow on roads, and was made more slippery by partial daytime thaw followed by overnight refreezing. It was the first white Christmas anywhere in the United Kingdom since 2004. There was another white Christmas in 2010, it was also the coldest Christmas Day ever recorded in the United Kingdom. In 2014, parts of the Northern Isles had a white Christmas and again in 2017, Northern England and Southern Scotland had a white Christmas.

== Other parts of Europe ==
In Europe, snow at Christmas is common in Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Baltic states, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, and northeastern Poland. In general, due to the influence of the warm Gulf Stream on European climate, chances of a white Christmas are lower farther west. For example, in southern France a white Christmas is rare, while in Bucharest, Romania, which is at a similar latitude, it is much more likely. Northern Italy and the mountain regions of central-south Italy may also have a white Christmas. In cities such as Turin, Milan or Bologna a Christmas with falling snow or snow on the ground is not a rarity. White Christmases are also common in the Carpathian Mountains, as well as the Alps.

== Southern Hemisphere ==
Because Christmas occurs during the summer in the Southern Hemisphere, white Christmases are especially rare events there, apart from Antarctica, which is generally uninhabited. A white Christmas elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere is approximately equivalent to having snow in the Northern Hemisphere on 25 June. Some places like Ushuaia, Argentina and Stanley, Falkland Islands have received measurable snowfall on Christmas Day on numerous occasions.

In 2006, a snowstorm hit the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, arriving on Christmas morning and bringing nearly of snow in higher areas.

In New Zealand&#x27;s Southern Alps, snow can fall any day of the year, and a white Christmas is possible. The same situation can be seen in the Andes at elevations above , with some locations on the Bolivian altiplano, such as El Alto, having the theoretical possibility of a white Christmas.

<doc id="176828" wikidata="Q5598067" url="?curid=176828" title="Gravity Research Foundation">
<text>The Gravity Research Foundation is an organization established in 1948 by businessman Roger Babson (founder of Babson College) to find ways to implement gravitational shielding. Over time, the foundation turned away from trying to block gravity and began trying to understand it. It holds an annual contest rewarding essays by scientific researchers on gravity-related topics. The contest, which awards prizes of up to $4,000, has been won by at least six people who later won the Nobel Prize in physics.

The foundation held conferences and conducted operations in New Boston, New Hampshire through the late 1960s, but that aspect of its operation ended following Babson&#x27;s death in 1967.
It is mentioned on stone monuments, donated by Babson, at more than a dozen American universities.

== History ==

Thomas Edison apparently suggested the creation of the Gravity Research Foundation to Babson, who established it in several scattered buildings in the small town of New Boston, New Hampshire. Babson said he chose that location because he thought it was far enough from big cities to survive a nuclear war. Babson wanted to put up a sign declaring New Boston to be the safest place in North America if World War III came, but town fathers toned it down to say merely that New Boston was a safe place.

In an essay titled &quot;Gravity – Our Enemy Number One&quot;, Babson indicated that his wish to overcome gravity dated from the childhood drowning of his sister. &quot;She was unable to fight gravity, which came up and seized her like a dragon and brought her to the bottom&quot;, he wrote.

The foundation held occasional conferences that drew such people as Clarence Birdseye of frozen-food fame and Igor Sikorsky, inventor of the helicopter. Sometimes, attendees sat in chairs with their feet higher than their heads, to counterbalance gravity. Most of the foundation&#x27;s work, however, involved sponsoring essays by researchers on gravity-related topics. It had only a couple of employees in New Boston.

The physical Gravity Research Foundation disappeared some time after Babson&#x27;s death in 1967. Its only remnant in New Boston is a granite slab in a traffic island that celebrates the foundation&#x27;s &quot;active research for antigravity and a partial gravity insulator&quot;. The building that held the foundation&#x27;s meetings has long held a restaurant, and for a time had a bar called Gravity Tavern, since renamed.

The essay award lives on, offering prizes of up to $4,000. As of 2020, it is still administered out of Wellesley, Massachusetts, by George Rideout, Jr., son of the foundation&#x27;s original director.

Over time, the foundation shed its crankish air, turning its attention from trying to block gravity to trying to understand it. The annual essay prize has drawn respected researchers, including physicist Stephen Hawking, who won in 1971, mathematician/author Roger Penrose (Nobel Prize in Physics, 2020), who won in 1975, and astrophysicist and Nobel laureate George Smoot, who won in 1993. Other notable award winners include Jacob Bekenstein, Sidney Coleman, Bryce DeWitt, Julian Schwinger (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1965), Martin Perl (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1995), Demetrios Christodoulou, Dennis Sciama, Gerard &#x27;t Hooft (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1999), Arthur E. Fischer, Jerrold E. Marsden, Robert Wald, John Archibald Wheeler and Frank Wilczek (Nobel Prize in Physics, 2004).

== Monuments ==
In the 1960s, Babson gave grants to a number of colleges that were accompanied by stone monuments. The monuments are inscribed with a variety of similar sayings, such as &quot;It is to remind students of the blessings forthcoming when a semi-insulator is discovered in order to harness gravity as a free power and reduce airplane accidents&quot; and &quot;It is to remind students of the blessings forthcoming when science determines what gravity is, how it works, and how it may be controlled.&quot;

Colleges that received monuments include:
* Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida
* Colby College in Waterville, Maine
* Eastern Baptist College in St. Davids, Pennsylvania
* Eastern Nazarene College in Quincy, Massachusetts
* Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia
* Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts
* Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, New York
* Keene State College in Keene, New Hampshire
* Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont
* Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut
* Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts
* Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama
* University of Tampa in Tampa, Florida
* Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois.
Hobart College&#x27;s &quot;H-Book&quot; contains a description of the circumstances surrounding the placement of its Gravity Monument: &quot;The location of the stone on campus was linked to a gift to the Colleges of &#x27;gravity grant&#x27; stocks, now totaling more than $1 million, from Roger Babson, the founder of Babson College. The eccentric Babson was intrigued by the notion of anti-gravity and inclined to further scientific research in this area. The Colleges used these funds to help construct Rosenberg Hall in 1994. Two trees that shade the stone are said to be direct descendants of Newton’s famous apple tree.&quot;

The stone at Colby College was once in front of the Keyes Building on the main academic quadrangle but was moved to a more obscure location near the Schair-Swenson-Watson Alumni Center. Students would often knock it over in an ironic testament to gravity&#x27;s power. At Tufts, the monument is the site of an &quot;inauguration ceremony&quot; for students who receive PhDs in cosmology, in which a thesis advisor drops an apple on the student&#x27;s head.

<text>Chelmsford () is a city in the City of Chelmsford district in the county of Essex, England. It is the county town of Essex and one of three cities in the county, along with Colchester and Southend-on-Sea. It is located north-east of London at Charing Cross and south-west of Colchester. The population of the urban area was 110,625 in the 2021 Census, while the wider district has 181,763.

The main conurbation of Chelmsford incorporates all or part of the former parishes of Broomfield, Newland Spring, Great Leighs, Great Waltham, Little Waltham, Great Baddow, Little Baddow, Galleywood, Howe Green, Margaretting, Pleshey, Stock, Roxwell, Danbury, Bicknacre, Writtle, Moulsham, Rettendon, The Hanningfields, The Chignals, Widford and Springfield, including Springfield Barnes, now known as Chelmer Village.

The communities of Chelmsford, Massachusetts; Chelmsford, Ontario; and Chelmsford, New Brunswick, are named after the city.

The demonym for a Chelmsford resident is &quot;Chelmsfordian&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
Before 1199, there were settlements nearby from ancient times. The remains of a Neolithic and a late Bronze Age settlement have been found in the Springfield suburb, and the town was occupied by the Romans. A Roman fort was built in AD 60, and a civilian town grew up around it. The town was given the name of Caesaromagus (&quot;Caesar&#x27;s field&quot; or &quot;Caesar&#x27;s marketplace&quot;), although the reason for it being given the great honour of bearing the Imperial prefix is now unclear – possibly as a failed &#x27;planned town&#x27; provincial capital to replace Londinium or Camulodunum. The remains of a &quot;mansio&quot;, a combination post office, civic centre and hotel, lie beneath the streets of modern Moulsham, and the ruins of an octagonal temple are located beneath the Odeon roundabout. The town disappeared for a while after the Romans left Britain.

An Anglo-Saxon burial was discovered at Broomfield to the north of Chelmsford in the late 19th century and the finds are now in the British Museum. The road &#x27;Saxon Way&#x27; now marks the site.

The city&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;Ceolmaer&#x27;s ford&quot; which was close to the site of the present High Street stone bridge. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the town was called &quot;Celmeresfort&quot; and by 1189 it had changed to &quot;Chelmsford&quot;. Its position on the Londinium – Camulodonum Roman road (the modern A12) ensured the early prosperity of Chelmsford.

===Royal charter===

On 7 September 1199, following the commissioning of a bridge over the River Can by Maurice, Bishop of London, King John granted to William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise a royal charter for Chelmsford to hold a market, marking the origin of the modern town. An under-cover market, operating Tuesday to Saturday, is still an important part of the city centre over 800 years later.

The town became the seat of the local assize during the early 13th century (though assizes were also held at Brentwood) and by 1218 it was recognised as the county town of Essex, a position it has retained to the present day.

===Royal connections===

King Robert I of Scotland, better known as Robert the Bruce (1274–1329), had close ties with the nearby village of Writtle and there is some evidence to suggest he was born at Montpeliers Farm in the village, but the story is disputed and possibly conflated with his father, Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale.

Chelmsford was significantly involved in the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, and King Richard II moved on to the town after quelling the rebellion in London. &#x27;The Sleepers and The Shadows&#x27;, written by Hilda Grieve in 1988 using original sources, states: &quot;For nearly a week, from Monday 1st July to Saturday 6th July [1381], Chelmsford became the seat of government ... The king probably lodged at his nearby manor house at Writtle. He was attended by his council, headed by the temporary Chancellor ... the new chief justice ... the royal chancery ... Their formidable task in Chelmsford was to draft, engross, date, seal and despatch by messengers riding to the farthest corners of the realm, the daily batches of commissions, mandates, letters, orders and proclamations issued by the government not only to speed the process of pacification of the kingdom, but to conduct much ordinary day-to-day business of the Crown and Government.&quot; Richard II famously revoked the charters which he had made in concession to the peasants on 2 July 1381, while in Chelmsford. It could be said that given this movement of government power, Chelmsford for a few days at least became the capital of England. Many of the ringleaders of the revolt were executed on the gallows at what is now Primrose Hill.

King Henry VIII purchased the Boleyn estate in 1516, and built Beaulieu Palace on the current site of New Hall School. This later became the residence of his then mistress, and later wife Anne. Soon after it became the residence of Henry&#x27;s daughter, by his first marriage, Mary I.

===Witchfinder General===

In the 17th century many of the victims of Matthew Hopkins (the self-styled &quot;Witchfinder General&quot;) spent their last days imprisoned in Chelmsford, before being tried at the Assizes and hanged for witchcraft.

===Charles Dickens===

In 1835, when visiting Essex and Suffolk to cover local elections, Charles Dickens visited Chelmsford. He was apparently so upset that he could not find a newspaper on a Sunday that he wrote in a letter to a friend that Chelmsford was &quot;the dullest and most stupid place on earth&quot;.

===Birthplace of radio===

* In 1899 Guglielmo Marconi opened the first &quot;wireless&quot; or radio factory in the world at Hall Street in the Moulsham area of Chelmsford. 
* In 1920 Marconi made the first official publicised sound broadcast in the United Kingdom, featuring Dame Nellie Melba at the New Street Works, the first purpose-built radio factory in the world. 
* In 1922, Marconi made the world&#x27;s first regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment (call sign &quot;2MT&quot;) began from the nearby village of Writtle. 
Station 2MT led to the creation of its sister station in London &quot;2LO&quot;, which subsequently led to the creation of the BBC.

===Bishopric===
In 1914 Chelmsford&#x27;s church became a cathedral (see below) and the town got its own bishop.

===World War II===
During World War II Chelmsford, an important centre of light engineering war production, was attacked from the air on several occasions, both by aircraft of the Luftwaffe and by missile. The worst single loss of life took place on Tuesday 19 December 1944, when the 367th Vergeltungswaffe 2 or V2 rocket to hit England fell on Henry Road, a residential street near the Hoffmans ball bearing factory and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company factory in New Street. Both factories were key to the war effort. Thirty-nine people were killed and 138 injured, 47 seriously. Several dwellings in Henry Road were completely destroyed, and many badly damaged in nearby streets. A monument to the dead is located in the city cemetery on Writtle Road.

On 14 May 1943 Luftwaffe bombing raids hit Chelmsford leaving more than 50 people dead and leaving nearly 1,000 homeless. The bombs hit mainly the town centre, Springfield, and Moulsham.

The GHQ Line part of the British hardened field defences of World War II runs directly through Chelmsford with many pillboxes still in existence to the north and south of the city.

Hylands Park, the site of the former annual V Festival, hosted a prisoner of war camp, and from 1944 until it was disbanded in 1945, was the headquarters of the Special Air Service (SAS).

===Recent history===
Since the 1980s defence-related industries in the city have declined, most notably the Marconi Company with all of its factories either being closed or sold. The site on West Hanningfield Road was sold to BAE Systems; the Waterhouse Lane site sold to E2V and the former New Street Works site has undergone major redevelopment for residential/mixed use.

The one-time largest employer in Chelmsford, RHP (the former Hoffman ball bearing manufacturer), closed its New Street/Rectory Lane site in 1989. Some of the factory was converted into luxury apartments and a health club although most of the site was demolished to make way for the Rivermead Campus of the Anglia Ruskin University.

The city&#x27;s location close to London and at the centre of Essex has helped it grow in importance as a financial, administrative and distribution centre.

The Channels Development, Beaulieu Park, The Village and Chancellor Park are some of the most recent large-scale housing developments built in the city. The local plan targets an additional 18,000 new homes by 2036, in developments largely to the north of the city.

In 2007, the Channel 4 programme &quot;Location, Location, Location&quot; voted Chelmsford the 8th-best place to live in the UK.

===UK city status===
The letters patent officially granting city status to the City of Chelmsford were received on 6 June 2012. to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

The announcement to make Chelmsford a city had been made on 14 March 2012 by the Lord President of the Privy Council and Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg.

==Local government and politics==
Chelmsford is at the geographic and political centre of Essex and has been the county town since 1215. The headquarters of Essex County Council is at County Hall, Duke Street and the headquarters of Chelmsford City Council at Chelmsford Civic Centre, Duke Street. The civic centre was designed by Cordingley &amp; McIntyre as a public library and completed in April 1935.

The headquarters of Essex Police is located in the Springfield area of the city at Kingston Crescent.

Chelmsford formed part of the ancient Chelmsford hundred of Essex. It was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1888, under the provisions of the Municipal Corporations Act 1882. In 1934 the borough was enlarged by gaining from Chelmsford Rural District, including parts of the parishes of Broomfield, Springfield, Widford and Writtle. The municipal borough and civil parish. was abolished on 1 April 1974 and its former area was combined with most of the remainder of the rural district to form the larger Borough of Chelmsford which was granted city status by Royal Charter in 2012.

For the Chelmsford constituency in the House of Commons, the member of Parliament is Marie Goldman. In the 2024 general election, Goldman gained 20,214 votes (39.9%), winning the seat with a majority over Vicky Ford, the Conservative candidate, who gained 15,461 votes (30.5%).

==Demographics==
The following statistics were measured in the 2001 Census:

* The population for Chelmsford consisted of male: 49.2%, female: 50.8%, under 18: 22.5%, over 60: 19%, born outside UK: 5.9%, English: 96%, black: 0.7%, Asian: 1.4%, mixed: 1.1%, other: 0.7%, Christian: 73.3%, Muslim: 0.9%.
* Education census statistics for Chelmsford consisted of full-time students between 16- 74: 20.2%, no qualifications for ages between 16 and 74: 22.2%.
* Housing census statistics for Chelmsford consisted of owner occupied housing: 76.5%, social housing: 14.9% (council: 11.3%, housing association 3.6%), privately rented: 6.3%, homes without central heating and/or private bathroom: 5.8%.

==Economy==

=== Business and commerce ===
Originally an agricultural and market town, Chelmsford has been an important centre for industry since the 19th century. Following the opening of the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation in 1797, cheaper transportation and raw materials made milling and malting the main industries until the 1850s, when increasing prosperity created a local market for agricultural machinery.

Foundries and engineering works followed including Fell Christy at his Factory (In later years known as Christy Norris Ltd) on the corner of Kings Road and Broomfield Road opened 1858, closed 1985, Coleman and Moreton, Thomas Clarkson (&quot;Steam&quot; Omnibus manufacturer and Founder of the Eastern National Bus Company) and Eddington and Stevenson (makers of traction engines). The Company Christy Norris still survives, trading as Christy Turner Ltd based in Ipswich. A residential street close to the old Factory was named &quot;Fell Christy&quot; in his honour.

As well as the headquarters of Essex Police, Essex County and Chelmsford City Councils, the modern city is home to a range of national and international companies including M&amp;G Group, Teledyne e2v and ebm-papst.

Chelmsford is largely a commercial city which employs around 80,000 people. There are three medium-sized shopping centres, Bond Street, High Chelmer and The Meadows. Chelmsford has six retail parks, Riverside, Chelmer Village, Clocktower Retail Park, The Army &amp; Navy, Moulsham Lodge Retail Park and the smaller Homelands Retail Park housing a Flagship B&amp;Q Store, Wyvale Garden Centre (part of the Garden centre Group) and Pets Corner. The High Street has a variety of independent and chain stores. On 29 September 2016 a new retail development opened anchored by John Lewis.

On 6 January 2005, Chelmsford was granted Fairtrade Town status.

Sizeable businesses are now based in the Chelmsford Business Park at Boreham housing companies such as the Anderson Group and Global Marine Systems. Chelmsford is a centre for national electricity suppliers operating within the industrial and commercial sectors, with both EnDCo and F&amp;S Energy headquartered within the city. The city has a low unemployment rate (1.6% in 2002) and a well-educated workforce, with 9% holding a degree or above (in 2002; British average: 7.1%).

Chelmsford has a vibrant nightlife scene with many pubs, late night bars and restaurant establishments in the city centre area. Its central Essex location and good public transport links make the city ideal for revellers, commuters and tourists to visit from surrounding areas.

===Marconi===

In 1899, Guglielmo Marconi opened the world&#x27;s first &quot;wireless&quot; factory under the name &#x27;The Marconi Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company&#x27; in Hall Street, employing around 50 people. The company was later called the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company Ltd. For this reason Chelmsford is credited as the &quot;birthplace of radio&quot;, and this phrase can be seen on administrative signs on major roads entering the city, although this statement is disputed.

Outgrowing its Hall Street premises, Marconi moved to the purpose-built New Street Works in June 1912. On 15 June 1920 the factory hosted the first official publicised sound broadcast in the United Kingdom, featuring Dame Nellie Melba and using two radio broadcasting masts.

In 1922, the world&#x27;s first regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began from the Marconi laboratories at Writtle near Chelmsford – Call sign &#x27;2MT&#x27; in what was little more than a wooden hut.

In 1999, Marconi&#x27;s defence division, including the Chelmsford facilities, was purchased by British Aerospace to form BAE Systems. Two sites remain under BAE control; the Great Baddow site which is now BAE&#x27;s Advanced Technology Centre and its Integrated Systems Technologies business at Glebe Road.

The military and secure communications division of Marconi was merged into Selex Communications based at the New Street factory. They vacated the site in April 2008 with the remaining operations moved to nearby Basildon, bringing to an end more than 100 years of the Marconi name in Chelmsford.

The New Street factory was scheduled to be redeveloped starting in 2010, but this fell through when site owners Ashwell Property Group entered administration in December 2009. The factory remained empty, derelict and vandalised for several years, to the dismay of Marconi Veterans and Chelmsfordians. The site was sold for redevelopment to Bellway Homes in the summer of 2012 with demolition of the majority of the site including the iconic Marconi House and Building 720 in April/May 2013. Only the Grade II listed water tower, The 1912 front building façade, the New Street cottages, and the power house will remain.

===Cromptons Electrical Engineering===
Chelmsford became home to the United Kingdom&#x27;s first electrical engineering works established by Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton. Crompton was a leading authority on electrical engineering, and pioneered electric street lighting and electric traction motors within the United Kingdom. He installed electric street lights in the town centre to celebrate the incorporation of the Borough of Chelmsford in 1888. Although this made Chelmsford one of the earliest towns to receive electric street lighting, the Council later removed it because gas from the Council owned gasworks was cheaper. Crompton supplied the traction motors for the first electric trains on Southend Pier. The company manufactured electrical switchgear, alternators and generators for many power stations in the UK and worldwide.

Crompton set up his original factory known as the &#x27;Arc Works&#x27; in Queen Street in 1878. After a fire there in 1895, he built a huge new electrical engineering factory also called the &#x27;Arc Works&#x27; in Writtle Road. Crompton and Co. became Crompton Parkinson in 1927 when Colonel Crompton partnered with fellow electrical engineer Frank Parkinson. During World War II, the factory was frequently targeted by the Luftwaffe. In 1969 a takeover by Hawker Siddeley saw Crompton Parkinson Ltd downsized and operations moved elsewhere. The Marconi Company took over the site which became the base for the newly formed Marconi Radar Systems.

After years of decline, the Marconi factory closed in 1992 and the site was demolished a few years later apart from the frontage on Writtle Road. &#x27;The Village&#x27; housing development now occupies the site with road names such as &quot;Rookes&quot; Crescent, &quot;Evelyn&quot; Place, &quot;Crompton&quot; Street and &quot;Parkinson&quot; Drive as tributes to the former occupant.

=== Hoffmann Ball Bearings ===
Hoffmann Ball bearings was a major employer in Chelmsford in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They produced ball bearings which were used for early transatlantic flight.

They opened a second factory at Stonehouse, Gloucestershire in the 1930s, alongside the Stroudwater Navigation.

The firm became Ransome Hoffmann and Pollard (R.H.P.) after Hoffman&#x27;s amalgamation with Ransome &amp; Marles and Pollard Ball and Roller Bearing Company in 1969.

The R.H.P. brand, intellectual property rights and company assets were absorbed into the Japanese NSK Ltd. bearing company in early 1990 trading as NSK-RHP Ltd. at its UK base in Newark on Trent with the historic R.H.P. name finally disappearing in 2001.

Most of the former Hoffman New Street factory was demolished during the summer of 1990 and the site is now occupied by the sprawling Rivermead Campus of the Anglia Ruskin University.

The only connection to the company name in Chelmsford today is the RHP Bowls club located on part of the old Hoffmans Social Club site at Canterbury Way and Hoffmans Way at the corner of the old factory site at New Street and Rectory Lane.

===English Electric Valve Company===

The Waterhouse Lane–based company began in the early 1940s as a part of the Marconi group, manufacturing magnetrons for defence radar systems. The company was first registered as a separate company in Chelmsford, Essex in 1947 under Serge Aisenstein. Its initial name was the Phoenix Dynamo Co Ltd, though it immediately changed its name to English Electric Valve Company Ltd.

In 1959 Bob Coulson established Traveling-wave tube and Microwave tube sections and they were producing ceramic hydrogen thyratrons as well. By this time EEV was the largest hi-tech manufacturing company in the UK. A year later they won an EMMY award for outstanding contribution to Electronics Technology in developing the 4½&quot; orthicon tube.

In 1961 they acquired Associated Electrical Industries Valve business based in Lincoln. Sir Charles Oatley was a director of the company from 1966 to 1985. In 1962, EEV opened its first office in America in Buffalo, NY. In the 1970s EEV collaborated with QinetiQ in the development of the pyroelectric vidicon, the first thermal imaging detector. The company has received 13 Queen&#x27;s Awards for Technology in its history, most recently in 2006 for low light imaging devices and in 2004 for thyratrons for cancer radiotherapy treatment. In 1972, they opened an office in Paris and in 1977 they opened another in New York; this time in Elmsford. 
Keith Attwood, e2v&#x27;s CEO joined in 1999, as MD of EEV, after a short period as Marconi Applied technologies, the company was renamed to e2v technologies in 2002 as part of a management buy out supported by 3i following the collapse of the Marconi group. Following further growth under 3i, in 2004 the company floated on the London Stock Exchange.

In 2017, e2v was acquired by US company Teledyne Technologies and changed its name to Teledyne e2v, 70 years after its registration as a Chelmsford-based company. As of 2022, Teledyne e2v continues its operations at the Waterhouse Lane site.

===Britvic===
The Britvic soft drink company began life as the British Vitamin Company in 1948. The origins of the company can be traced back to a chemist&#x27;s shop in Tindal Street where flavoured waters were on sale as early as the mid-19th century.

The company was acquired by Showerings of Shepton Mallet, and subsequently a division of Allied Breweries from 1968, The British Vitamin Company changed its name to Britvic in 1971. 
In 1986 it merged with &quot;Canada Dry Rawlings&quot; and acquired the R. White&#x27;s Lemonade brand. It acquired Tango from Beechams in 1987 and since that year it has owned the UK franchise for Pepsi and 7 Up. In 1995 it bought Robinson&#x27;s from Reckitt &amp; Colman.

In December 2005 the Company underwent an initial public offering (IPO) allowing its main shareholders (InterContinental Hotels Group, Whitbread, Pernod Ricard) to realise their investments.

In May 2007 the company went on to buy the soft drinks and distribution businesses of Ireland&#x27;s Cantrell &amp; Cochrane (C&amp;C) for £169.5m.

On 14 November 2012 the Company agreed to merge with Scotland&#x27;s A.G. Barr, producer of Scottish soft drinks Irn-Bru, Tizer and D&#x27;n&#x27;B, to create one of Europe&#x27;s largest soft drinks companies. However the merger was put into serious doubt after the Office of Fair Trading referred the merger to the Competition Commission.

The Britvic UK headquarters at Britvic House in Broomfield Road closed in March 2012. It relocated to Hemel Hempstead to facilitate better transport links for its staff.
On 14 March 2014 the Britvic Westway factory closed for good thus ending the company&#x27;s 150-year association with the city.

==Transport==
===Railway===
The Eastern Counties Railway arrived in Chelmsford in 1842. Owing to the geography of the city, three viaducts were constructed: the longest of which has 18-arches through Central Park; the station is at the end of the second viaduct; and the third is at the River Chelmer, Springfield. The current station dates from around 1885.

Greater Anglia operates all services at Chelmsford railway station:
* Southbound services operate to London Liverpool Street, via and 
* Northbound services run to Colchester, Ipswich, Clacton-on-Sea, Harwich, Braintree and Norwich, via the Great Eastern Main Line. 

Around 14,000 commuters each day travel to Liverpool Street by train, making Chelmsford one of the busiest non-terminus stations outside London.

===Buses===
The current bus terminal in Duke Street is the focal point of services in the city. It replaced the ageing 1930s bus station in March 2007 with shops, apartments and a covered roof for passengers.

Routes are operated by the following companies:
* First Essex is the primary operator, running many routes around the city and beyond including to Basildon, Billericay, Braintree, Colchester, Maldon and Southend. It also operates the X10/X30 &quot;Essex Airlink&quot; to Stansted Airport. There are a variety of school buses serving the city and surrounding areas.
* Arriva Colchester operates a single service, the 59 route, to Harlow, via Roxwell, The Rodings, Hatfield Heath and Old Harlow.
* Other bus companies serve the area including Stephensons of Essex and Hedingham &amp; Chambers.

Outside of peak times, many of these services are run under contract to Essex County Council.

Essex County Council&#x27;s Highways and Transportation Department have considered constructing a &quot;Bus Rapid Transit System&quot; to be built serving the Beaulieu Park/Springfield Area because of the increasing demand for Rapid Transit Plans in Ipswich, Colchester and Southend.

Chelmsford has a park &amp; ride service at nearby Sandon, just off junction 18 of the A12; it runs Monday to Saturday, with a capacity of 1,200 cars. Opened in March 2006, it has proved highly successful and is used widely.

A second service, known as the &quot;Chelmer Valley Park and Ride&quot;, was opened on the A130/A131 to the north of the city near Little Waltham in April 2011.

===Road===

The A12 trunk road, which connects east London and Lowestoft, was originally built by the Romans to connect London and Colchester. It used to run through the city, until the £34.8m nine-mile (14 km) bypass around the east opened in November 1986. Despite being notorious for frequent congestion, poor road surfaces, potholes and accidents, many people move to Chelmsford for it being so well connected by road and rail. 

The A414 trunk road between Hemel Hempstead and Maldon is a main road into the city, just off the A12, and links the city to junction 7 of the [M11] motorway in the west, near Harlow. 

The A130 provides a link to the A127 and A13, while the A131 passes through smaller towns and villages. The nearest motorway is the M25 &quot;London Orbital&quot; at J11 of the A12, 14 miles away, near Brentwood.

In the south-west of the city centre, the A138 meets the A414 at the Army and Navy roundabout which is notorious for its traffic congestion:
* Traffic lights were tried to improve matters in the early 2000s, but that scheme was abandoned after a short while; however, some of the lights were recommissioned for early morning and evening part-time use in 2009. 
* The recently-built bus lane on the A1114 Great Baddow bypass, and priority to traffic using it, has meant traffic queues approaching the roundabout can now be over long during peak periods. 
* The roundabout is known as the &quot;Army and Navy&quot; even though the public house and music venue from which the junction got its name has long been demolished. 
* Until 2019, the junction had an unusual bi-directional flyover (in a similar manner to the Hogarth Roundabout in Chiswick); it was open for city-bound traffic westerly until 2.30 pm each day and then easterly out of the city after 2.30 pm. The Army and Navy roundabout flyover was condemned as unsafe and was permanently closed in September 2019 by Essex County Council with demolition works taking place in February/March 2020.
* Construction of the £32 million replacement A138 Chelmer Viaduct road, which connects Chelmer Village Way roundabout to the Army and Navy roundabout, began in February 2015. The new bridge replaced the previous structure, built in 1932, which was demolished in 2016.
* On 15 January 2024, final plans were announced for the £81m Army and Navy sustainable transport package by Essex County Council including a so-called &#x27;hamburger&#x27; roundabout due for completion by 2028.

Since 2 September 2013, to save money and reduce carbon emissions, many streets lights in the Chelmsford district switched over to Essex County Council&#x27;s part-night street lighting scheme. This involves most street lights being switched off between 1:00 am and 5:00 am (Tuesday to Sunday) with exceptions such as the city centre area, key road junctions, some pedestrian crossings and known accident sites; on Monday mornings, the switch off is from midnight to 5:00 am.

===Air===
Chelmsford is 25 to 30 minutes by road from Stansted Airport (via A130/A120); London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London City, Luton and Southend airports are all within reach by rail.

===Future transport plans===
Proposals for a bypass of Chelmsford connecting the A12 interchange at Boreham (junction 19) and the A131 were put forward for public consultation by Essex County Council in 2006; the preferred route was announced in March 2007. It comprises the creation of of two-lane dual carriageway and junctions connecting to the A12 and A131, it will sever 10 footpaths/bridleways and involve almost entirely greenfield construction. The scheme was estimated to cost £138 million in March 2007 but was increased to an estimated range of £229 – £262 million in February 2008. The scheme still requires funding and planning permission with applications timetabled for 2009–2011, a public inquiry timetabled for 2012 and with an estimated construction start date of 2014–2016. The Chelmsford North Action Group (NAG) objects to this scheme, stating that Chelmsford was to &quot;be engulfed by huge motorways connecting the Channel Ports, via a new Lower Thames Crossing, A130, on to Stansted, M11 and A14&quot;.

A second railway station, to be called Beaulieu Park, has been proposed to serve the new Beaulieu housing developments to the north-east of Chelmsford. Work began in January 2023 and the station is set to open in late 2025.

==Redevelopment==

A major new development on the Duke Street site of the old 1930s bus station was completed in 2007, which contains a new smaller bus station, shops and luxury apartments. The lower level apartments of this development and the bus station area is known as &quot;Marconi Plaza&quot;, while the upper level apartments are known as the &quot;Kings Tower&quot;. The new bus station and shops were opened in January 2007, while the rest of the development was ready in September 2007.

A new housing development site near Beaulieu Park, towards the north of the city, is currently under construction; it will be an urban village containing around 3,500 homes.

The public house &quot;The Army and Navy&quot;, from which the roundabout gets its name, was demolished in March 2007. It was replaced by a Travelodge hotel, a &quot;Frankie &amp; Benny&#x27;s&quot; restaurant, a bed store and private apartments. Building work started at the site in October 2007 and the project was completed in December 2008.

Recently, plans were revealed for &quot;Waterside&quot;, a large development of shops, bars and restaurants on the banks of the River Chelmer on derelict land near the Essex Records Office, at the end of Wharf Road. If this development goes ahead, High Bridge Road, which connects Parkway and Springfield Road, would be demolished along with the adjacent gasometers and a new central link road would be built.

The former Anglia Ruskin University central campus, off Park Road, was demolished in January/February 2010; it has been redeveloped by social housing provider &quot;Genesis&quot; as a mixed use development of housing for social rent, alongside other new housing for private sale and several retail units, new squares, streets and plazas. The new development has been given the name &quot;City Park West&quot;.

High Chelmer shopping centre underwent a refit during 2008/2009 with new flooring, lighting with a new front entrance and a rebounded logo. Further work is being carried out in the shopping centre; an old portion was demolished in spring 2011 and the work was completed in early 2012.

In January 2011, John Lewis announced, together with development partner Aquila House Holdings, that it was to anchor a brand new department store as part of a retail development at Bond Street. The site opened in September 2016.

==Places of interest==

Hylands House and Park, just to the west of the city, are a country house and parkland which were saved from dereliction after being purchased by the local council in 1966, after the death of the last private owner, and is now open to the public. Dating from 1730, the house was much damaged by fire and vandalism by the time of the sale, but has since been completely restored by Chelmsford City Council and is now available for weddings and other private hires including conferences. The park was landscaped by Humphry Repton has hosted a wide range of community events, including the annual music festival V Festival. The 21st World Scout Jamboree 2007 was held at Hylands Park from 27 July to 8 August 2007. Within the grounds which comprise woodland, rolling grassland and lakes is a large children&#x27;s play area with adjoining car parking.

Chelmsford Museum in Oaklands Park, off Moulsham Street, is a local history and industrial heritage museum which incorporates the Essex Regiment Museum. A major £5 million extension and redevelopment scheme opened in January 2010 and the museum now includes exhibits and interactive displays focusing on Crompton, Marconi, and Hoffmann, as well as illustrating the development of the town and city from prehistory up to modern times. Further development in 2019 upgraded the museum to include new visitor facilities as well as new exhibits from the Saxon burial site at Broomfield. A second site at Sandford Mill – Chelmsford&#x27;s former waterworks – displays further exhibits from Chelmsford&#x27;s telecommunications, electrical engineering and rolling bearings industries.

The Shire Hall is situated at the top of the High Street. Opened in July 1791 and built by local architect and Essex county surveyor John Johnson, it features a Portland stone façade. One of the oldest and most prominent buildings in Chelmsford, it was built as a courthouse and there has been a court on the site since at least 1199. However this finally came to an end on 2 April 2012 with the opening of a new magistrates&#x27; court a short distance away in New Street.

Chelmsford Cathedral, which is located directly behind the Shire Hall, is one of the oldest buildings in the city. Originally called &quot;St Mary&#x27;s Church&quot;, it became a cathedral when the Diocese of Chelmsford for the Bishop of Chelmsford was created in 1914. It is officially the second smallest in England behind Derby Cathedral.

Chelmsford Prison is a male prison and Young Offenders Institution, constructed in 1830. The 1979 film special of the TV series &quot;Porridge&quot; with Ronnie Barker was filmed largely on location at Chelmsford Prison, while it was closed for repairs after a fire.

The 1842 constructed, 18-arch Victorian railway viaduct (that spans the River Can in Central Park) is one of three railway viaducts in the city that carry the Great Eastern Main Line. The viaduct was constructed by the Eastern Counties Railway and opened for passenger traffic on 29 March 1843.

Chelmsford&#x27;s two tallest buildings are:
* Parkside Court, built in 1962 as Melbourne Court in Melbourne Avenue, sometimes locally known as &quot;Melbourne flats&quot;, and 
* the 13-floor &quot;Kings Tower&quot; in Duke Street, completed in 2007. 
They share the same height of .

The tallest structure by far in the borough is the former Chain Home radar tower in Great Baddow which rises to . The tower was constructed in 1937 and originally stood at the village of Canewdon&#x27;s former RAF base (1936–1970). However, in 1956 it was relocated to Great Baddow. It is the only Chain Home tower still in its original unmodified form in the United Kingdom and is a highly visible landmark throughout the surrounding area. The tower was finally given Grade II listed building status in October 2019 by Historic England.

==Geography and climate==

===Geology===
From over 600,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene ice age, until the Anglian Stage around 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, the early River Thames flowed through the area where Chelmsford now stands, from Harlow to Colchester, before crossing what is now the North Sea to become a tributary of the Rhine. Consequently, gravel deposits are frequently found in the area and current and former gravel pits in the district are common.

Chelmsford has two rivers, the River Can and the River Chelmer. Although often confused to be the same river in the city centre, they are quite separate until they join towards the east of the city to form the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation which heads out towards Maldon before flowing into tidal waters at the Blackwater Estuary. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near Thaxted while the Can comes from the West from Writtle where it separates from the River Wid.

Until the 1960s, these rivers were extremely prone to flooding the city centre area including two disastrous floods in August 1888 (known locally as &#x27;The Great Flood&#x27;) and in September 1958 (which also badly affected nearby Wickford) causing widespread damage. Flood prevention schemes in the 1960s on both rivers have largely prevented any further incidents here although the natural floodplains to the north and east such as The &#x27;Baddow Meads&#x27; and The &#x27;Chelmer Valley&#x27; continue to see flooding after prolonged heavy rainfall.

===Climate===
As with most of the UK, Chelmsford has a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification), however due to its proximity to continental Europe, Chelmsford enjoys warm summers and cool but not cold winters, with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature. Being in the southeast of England, the city enjoys a warmer climate than most of the United Kingdom and is one of the driest areas in the country. The nearest met office weather station is in Writtle, west of the city centre.

The record highest temperature recorded in Chelmsford was on 19 July 2022 beating the previous record of which was set on 25 July 2019.

The coldest temperature recorded in Chelmsford was on 29 January 1947. A low of was recorded during December 1981, and more recently the temperature fell to on 20 December 2010. Frost is common, occurring on an average of 53 nights of the year.

Rainfall averages 591.8 mm a year, with daily totals of over 1 mm falling on 108.1 days of the year. Thunderstorms are rare and mostly occur during July and August. All averages refer to the 30-year observation period 1981–2010.

Chelmsford was struck by a F1 tornado on 23 November 1981 as part of the record-breaking nationwide United Kingdom tornado outbreak on that day causing some damage in the city centre.

==Education==
Chelmsford has a wide range of educational institutions. Higher education in the city is provided at one campus of Anglia Ruskin University (formerly called Anglia Polytechnic) and Writtle University College.

===Religion===
Chelmsford Cathedral is the second smallest cathedral in England after Derby Cathedral. It was built in the 15th and early 16th centuries, when it was the parish church of the prosperous medieval town. The Diocese of Chelmsford was established in 1914 from part of the Diocese of St Albans. It covers all of Essex and much of East London.

Chelmsford is situated in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brentwood and the two dioceses are now uniquely (at least within England) conterminous. With the coming of the Reformation the Catholic community of Chelmsford was subjected to the anti-Catholic laws and Chelmsford was the site of the death of a Catholic martyr, Saint John Payne. In the 19th century, native Catholics resurfaced and immigrants helped to build up the Catholic community. There are now three Catholic churches within Chelmsford along with a Norbertine canonry situated on New London Road; St. Philip&#x27;s Priory and one of the largest Catholic private boarding schools in the country, New Hall School.

Other denominations are represented, the Baptists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventist Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Presbyterians, the Quakers, and the United Reformed Church all have places of worship within the city. The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses&#x27; &quot;Bethel&quot;, or UK supervisory office, is based in Chelmsford.

The club&#x27;s home ground is at the Chelmsford Sport and Athletics Centre, Melbourne Park, which it shares with Chelmsford Athletic Club. Chelmsford is one of the largest settlements in England without a Football League team. The city is home to the Chelmsford Sunday League, of which there are five divisions consisting of teams from around the area. The former ground of the club the New Writtle Street Stadium hosted greyhound racing which was one of two venues to do so. The other was at Springfield on local farmland on Pump Lane corner which took place during April 1949. The racing at both was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and they were known as flapping tracks, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.

The Chelmsford Rugby Football Club was established in 1920 and for the last 40 years has been playing rugby at Coronation Park in Timpsons Lane. As of 2016 the club has over 300 members and fields up to five senior teams each week. The club as of 2016 plays in the London 1 North league, the sixth tier of English rugby.

The club promotes the use of junior players and local players from the Chelmsford and Essex area.
Horse racing has been run at two separate venues using the name Chelmsford, neither actually in the city centre itself. The sport originally took place at Chelmsford Racecourse, at Galleywood, from the 18th century until its closure in 1935. A new racecourse was established at Great Leighs in 2008 and subsequently changed its name to Chelmsford City Racecourse.

Since 2014 the city has held a marathon. Starting and ending in the city centre, the marathon takes in the city itself and the surrounding environs. The 2014 edition had over 1000 participants.

<text>The history of Missouri begins with settlement of the region by indigenous people during the Paleo-Indian period beginning in about 12,000 BC. Subsequent periods of native life emerged until the 17th century. New France set up small settlements, and in 1803, Napoleonic France sold the area to the U.S. as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Statehood for Missouri came following the Missouri Compromise in 1820 that allowed slavery. Settlement was rapid after 1820, aided by a network of rivers navigable by steamboats, centered in the City of St. Louis. It attracted European immigrants, especially Germans; the business community had a large Yankee element as well. The Civil War saw numerous small battles and control by the Union. After the war, its economy diversified, and railroads centered in Kansas City, opened up new farmlands in the west.

Progressive Era reforms In the early 20th century sought to modernize state and local government and minimize political corruption. During the 20th century, Missouri&#x27;s economy diversified further, and it developed a balanced agricultural and economic sector. By the 21st century manufacturing was fading, as service industries grew, especially in medicine, education, and tourism. Agriculture would still remain profitable economic sector, as farms grew larger due to mechanization.

==Pre-Columbian era==

Indigenous peoples inhabited Missouri for thousands of years before European exploration and settlement. Archaeological excavations along the rivers have shown continuous habitation for more than 7,000 years. Beginning before 1000 CE, there arose the complex Mississippian culture, whose people created regional political centers at present-day St. Louis and across the Mississippi River at Cahokia, near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. Their large cities included thousands of individual residences, but they are known for their surviving massive earthwork mounds, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platform, ridgetop and conical shapes. Cahokia was the center of a regional trading network that reached from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. The civilization declined by 1400 CE, and most descendants left the area long before the arrival of Europeans. St. Louis was at one time known as Mound City by the European Americans, because of the numerous surviving prehistoric mounds, since lost to urban development. The Mississippian culture left mounds throughout the middle Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, extending into the southeast as well as the upper river.

==European exploration, conquest, and colonization (1673–1803)==

In May 1673 the French Jesuit priest Jacques Marquette and French trader Louis Jolliet paddled down the Mississippi River in canoes along the area that would later become the state of Missouri.

During the late 1680s and 1690s the French pursued colonization of central North America – not only to promote trade, but also to thwart the efforts of England on the continent. Pierre-Gabriel Marest, a Jesuit priest, in late 1700 established a mission on the west bank of the Mississippi at the mouth of the River Des Peres. Marest established his mission station with a handful of French settlers and a large band of the Kaskaskia people, who fled from the eastern Illinois Country to the station in the hope of receiving French protection from the Iroquois. The Mississippi-Missouri river system waterways were the main means of communication and transportation in the region.

During the 1710s the French government again began to pursue a course of increased development of the region, which Native Americans, imperial officials, and local European settlers conceived of the region as being part of the &quot;Illinois Country,&quot; referring to the confederacy of Native communities that dominated the region. . Boisbriand ordered the construction of Fort de Chartres about eighteen miles north of Kaskaskia as the base of operations and headquarters for the company in the area. After the construction of Fort de Chartres, the company directed a series of prospecting expeditions to an area 30 miles west of the Mississippi River in present-day Madison, St. Francois, and Washington counties. These mining operations generally focused on discovering either lead or silver ore. Despite severe financial losses in late 1720, in January 1722 the company&#x27;s directors sent Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont to Missouri to protect the company&#x27;s trade networks on the Missouri River from Spanish influence. In November 1723, Bourgmont and the party arrived in present-day Carroll County in northern Missouri, where they constructed Fort Orleans. Within a year, Bourgmont negotiated alliances with indigenous tribes along the Missouri River. The quick abandonment of the fort after its construction was necessitated by the general retreat on the part of the company after the financial losses of 1720, and in 1731, the company returned its charter and control of Louisiana to royal authority. During the 1730s and 1740s, French control over Missouri remained weak, and no permanent settlements existed on the western bank of the Mississippi River.

French settlers remained on the east bank of the Mississippi at Kaskaskia and Fort de Chartres until 1750, when the new settlement of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri was constructed. Though in present-day Missouri, the settlement at Ste. Genevieve was still thought of as part of the Illinois Country. During its early years, Ste. Genevieve grew slowly due to its location on a muddy, flat, floodplain, and in 1752, the town had only 23 full-time residents. The people were farmers. Using enslaved Africans and Native peoples, the settlement primarily grew wheat, corn and tobacco.

===Spanish settlement and government===

Disputes between France and England over control of the Ohio Valley resulted in the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754. The British won and France lost all its holdings. France gave Spain control of Louisiana in November 1762 in the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
Meanwhile, the French governor of Louisiana granted a trade monopoly over the parts of the Illinois Country lying west of the Mississippi River to New Orleans merchant Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent and his partner, Pierre Laclède. In August 1763, Laclede and his stepson Auguste Chouteau departed New Orleans to establish a settlement in the Illinois Country, where in February 1764 they established St. Louis on high bluffs overlooking the Mississippi. By the 1770s, most Europeans in the region referred to the area as &quot;Upper Louisiana.&quot; Concern about living under British rule led many French settlers east of the Mississippi River to decamp for the Louisiana on the west bank of the Mississippi.
Spanish dominion over the European settlements in Upper Louisiana led to population growth in Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis, as a result of French immigration from British-held Illinois and the forced migration of enslaved Africans Americans and Native Americans. Ste. Genevieve continued to suffer from periodic flooding, although during the 1770s its population of 600 made it slightly larger than St. Louis. While the residents of Ste. Genevieve took a balanced approach between fur trading and farming, St. Louisans had a particular focus on fur trading, which led to periodic food shortages and the city&#x27;s nickname of &#x27;Paincourt&#x27;, mistakenly understood as &#x27;short of bread&#x27; in the historical literature. Robust evidence from the St. Lawrence Valley has shown otherwise, as the same place name is also found in Canada. South of St. Louis a satellite city known as Carondelet was established in 1767, although it never thrived. A third major settlement was established in 1769, when Louis Blanchette, a Canadian trader, set up a trading post on the northwest bank of the Missouri River, which eventually grew into the town of St. Charles.

In 1770 Pedro Piernas fully replaced St. Ange as administrator of the colony, although he retained the veteran Frenchman as an adviser. Local administrators of Ste. Genevieve also were Spanish-appointed, but frequently were forced to acquiesce to local customs. Throughout the 1770s, Spanish officials were forced to contend not only with the wishes of their predominantly French populations, but also with repeated incursions from British traders and hostile indigenous tribes.

To reduce the influence of British traders, Spain renewed efforts to encourage French settlers to decamp from Illinois to Missouri, and in 1778, the Spanish offered generous land grants, basic supplies, and access to enslaved African Americans to Catholic immigrants on the east bank of the Mississippi River. However, only a small number of Illinois French pursued settlement across the Mississippi. A second effort by the Spanish against the British found greater success: starting in the late 1770s, the Spanish officials began openly supporting American rebels fighting against British rule in the American War of Independence. Spanish officials in both St. Louis and Ste. Genevieve were instrumental in supplying George Rogers Clark during his Illinois campaign of 1779.

But Spanish aid to the rebels came at a price: in June 1779, Spain declared war on England, and word reached Missouri of the war in February 1780. By March 1780, St. Louis was warned of an impending British attack, and the Spanish government began preparations for a fort at the town, known as Fort San Carlos. In late May, a British war party attacked the town of St. Louis; although the town was saved, 21 were killed, 7 were wounded, and 25 were taken prisoner.

After the American victory in its war of independence, the European countries involved negotiated a set of treaties known as the Peace of Paris. The Spanish, who retained Louisiana, were forced to contend with large numbers of American immigrants crossing into Missouri from the east. Rather than attempt to stifle the immigration of American Protestants, however, Spanish diplomats began encouraging it in an effort to create an economically successful province.

As part of this effort, in 1789 Spanish diplomats in Philadelphia encouraged George Morgan, an American military officer, to set up a semi-autonomous colony in southern Missouri across from the mouth of the Ohio River. Named New Madrid, the colony began auspiciously but was discouraged by Louisiana&#x27;s governor, Esteban Rodríguez Miró, who considered Morgan&#x27;s infant colony as flawed due to its lack of provisos for ensuring the settlement&#x27;s loyalty to Spain. New Madrid&#x27;s early American settlers departed, as did Morgan, and New Madrid became primarily a hunting and trading outpost rather than a full-fledged agricultural city.

Despite Spanish diplomats&#x27; efforts, during the early 1790s both Governor Miró and his successor, Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet, were cool toward the idea of American immigration to Missouri. However, with the onset of the Anglo-Spanish War in 1796, Spain again needed an influx of settlement to defend the region. To that end, Spain offered U.S. settlers, free land, no taxes, and religious freedom in Spanish territory. This offer proved attractive to settlers in Kentucky who could not obtain clear title to land. Settlement in Spanish Missouri also proved attractive to slaveholders in Illinois, where the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 left the status of slavery uncertain. Among these American pioneers was Daniel Boone, who settled with his family after encouragement from the territorial governor. In the late 1790s, a significant number of U.S. settlers moved to Spanish Missouri seeking free land, no taxes, and guarantees for slavery. In the 1790s, approximately 1/5 of Missouri&#x27;s non-Native American population consisted of enslaved African Americans.

To better govern the region of Missouri, the Spanish split the province into five administrative districts in the mid-1790s: St. Louis, St. Charles, Ste. Genevieve, Cape Girardeau and New Madrid. Of the five administrative districts, the newest was Cape Girardeau, founded in 1792 by trader Louis Lorimier as a trading post and settlement for newly arriving Americans. The largest district, St. Louis, was the provincial capital and center of trade; by 1800, its district population stood at nearly 2,500. Aside from Carondelet, other settlements in the St. Louis district included Florissant, located 15 miles northwest of St. Louis and settled in 1785, and Bridgeton, located 5 miles southwest of Florissant and settled in 1794. All three settlements were popular with immigrants from the United States.

But these American settlers fundamentally changed the makeup of Missouri; by the mid-1790s, Spanish officials realized the American Protestant immigrants were not interested in converting to Catholicism or in serious loyalty to Spain. Despite a brief attempt to restrict immigration to Catholics only, the heavy immigration from the United States changed the lifestyle and even the primary language of Missouri; by 1804, more than three-fifths of the population were immigrants from the U.S. whether black or white, free or enslaved. With little return on their investment of time and money in the colony, the Spanish negotiated the return of Louisiana, including Missouri, to France in 1800, which was codified in the Treaty of San Ildefonso.
By 1800 the non-Native American population of Upper Louisiana, approximately 20% of whom were enslaved, was primarily concentrated in a few settlements along the Mississippi in present-day Missouri. The majority of land in Missouri was controlled by Native Americans. Travel between towns was by the river. Agriculture was the primary economic activity. Most farming families produced surpluses, which were sold to merchants who shipped foodstuffs downriver to plantation settlements in the Natchez Country and Louisiana. Fur trading, lead mining, and salt making were also significant economic activities for residents during the 1790s. The use of slave labor was central to economic life in Missouri, and perhaps twenty percent of the population was black and enslaved.

The settlers in early Spanish Missouri, both black and white, were mostly French-speakers, and the Catholic Church was a significant part of life. Through 1773, Missouri parishes lacked resident priests, and residents were served by traveling priests from the east side of the Mississippi. During the 1770s and 1780s, both Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis gained resident priests. Protestant services were not allowed in the colony. However, itinerant Protestant preachers frequently visited the settlements in private, and restrictions on Protestant residency were rarely enforced. According to historian William E. Foley, Spanish Missouri lived under a &quot;de facto form of religious toleration,&quot; with few residents demanding rigid orthodoxy.

There was no aristocracy. The highest class was based upon wealth and constituted of a mixed group of creole merchants linked by familial ties. Below them were the artisans and craftsmen of the society, followed by laborers of all types, including boatmen, hunters, and soldiers. At the bottom of the social system were free blacks, servants, and coureur des bois, with enslaved Native Americans and Africans forming the bottom class.

Women in the region were responsible for a variety of domestic tasks, including food preparation and clothing making. French women were well known for their cooking, which incorporated both French staples such as soups and fricassees and African and Creole foods such as gumbo. The colonists also ate local meats, including squirrel, rabbits, and bear, although they preferred beef, pork and fowl. Most foods were local, although sugar and liquor were imported until the late Spanish period. Malaria particularly affecting low-lying settlements such as Ste. Genevieve.

==Territorial and early statehood history (1804–1860)==
===Territorial government and the War of 1812===
Although Napoleon and France took &quot;de jure&quot; control of Spanish Missouri in 1800, the transfer remained secret; Spanish officials continued to govern the European settlements on the west bank of the Mississippi throughout the period of French ownership. In February 1802, the French sent a military force to reconquer St. Domingue as a stepping stone to enforce control of New France, but throughout the year, disease and the continuing Haitian Revolution ended the French expedition. In October 1802, these officials suspended foreign trade at the port of New Orleans, which led the United States to negotiate with France to purchase New Orleans in March 1803. However, the destruction of French forces by formerly enslaved Haitians and the desire for money to fight Britain led Napoleon to sell all of Louisiana, including Missouri, to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase.

Official news of the transfer reached the region in August 1803 in a letter from the governor of the Indiana Territory, William Henry Harrison. Although the transfer of all of Louisiana was formalized in a ceremony in New Orleans in December 1803, a separate ceremony took place in St. Louis in March 1804 to commemorate the transfer of Upper Louisiana from French to United States colonial status. At the time of the transfer, the purchase was initially divided into two parts: land north of the thirty-third parallel (including present-day Missouri) became the District of Louisiana, which was added to the jurisdiction of the Indiana Territory under Harrison. However, most Missourians disliked the arrangement, arguing that the territorial capital at Vincennes, Indiana, was too far away, and that slavery had no legal protection. In 1805, Congress reorganized the territory and created the Louisiana Territory with its government seat in St. Louis. This new arrangement initially gave its inhabitants no voice in government, although the territorial governor and three judges worked in St. Louis. In addition, Congress removed the restrictions on slavery in Upper Louisiana.

The land south of the thirty-third parallel, then-known as the Territory of Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812, and the Louisiana Territory was renamed the Missouri Territory. That year, the territory was raised in status and its inhabitants were granted legislative rights for the first time. Citizens selected one representative for every 500 free white males to a territorial House of Representatives, which acted as the lower house in the territorial bicameral legislature. The upper house, the Legislative Council, was composed of nine men chosen by the president from 18 candidates, put forth by the House. The territory also elected a non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives.

Except for first governor James Wilkinson, the territory&#x27;s governors during this period were generally well-equipped and adequate to the task. From the time of the purchase to the creation of the Louisiana Territory, Amos Stoddard was the primary commandant of the District of Louisiana; in 1805 upon the organization of the territory, President Jefferson named James Wilkinson as its first territorial governor. He was, however, a traitor to the United States, and participated in the Burr conspiracy to lead a revolution in the West. Wilkinson had made few allies in Missouri during his tenure, becoming known for drinking and attempting to steal the business of Creole fur traders. He was unceremoniously removed from his post in March 1807, and he was replaced as governor by the newly returned hero of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Meriwether Lewis.

Meriwether Lewis, however, was not well-positioned for his new role as governor. Although he performed satisfactorily, his new popularity and position led to heavy drinking and increased moodiness. On a trip to Washington, D.C. in 1809 he died, probably having committed suicide. Lewis&#x27;s replacement, Benjamin Howard, was a Kentucky congressman who served capably from 1810 to 1813, particularly during the War of 1812. Upon his promotion to brigadier general in the U.S. Army, Howard resigned the governorship. The last territorial governor, William Clark, was also well known for his role in the expedition to the West; he served the territory well and dealt fairly with settlers and indigenous peoples alike from 1813 to 1821.

Soon after the Louisiana Purchase, the U.S. Army built military forts to establish control over the territory and promote trade. Fort Bellefontaine was made an Army post near St. Louis in 1804. In an attempt to influence and control the Osage tribe, the government built Fort Osage near present-day Sibley, on the Missouri River in the western part of the state.

Missouri was at the western frontier during the War of 1812, and no major battles took place in the territory between British forces and Americans during the war. However, in the year leading up to open conflict and after the declaration of war, several skirmishes broke out between indigenous peoples and frontier settlers. In 1811, Indiana Territorial Governor Harrison led an early attack on the forces of Shawnee Chief Tecumseh at the Battle of Tippecanoe, provoking fighting between tribes east of the Mississippi and American settlers there. Few tribes in Missouri itself fought against the settlers before or during the War of 1812, but Missouri settlers suffered from several raids by Sac and Fox groups that invaded from Illinois.

Nearly all attacks took place against settlements in the central part of the state, north of the Missouri River, or along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Among others, places raided or attacked included Charette, Cote sans Dessein, Femme Osage, Fort Cap au Gris, Portage des Sioux, and St. Charles. Federal forces were withdrawn from Fort Osage for the length of the war in 1813, leaving Fort Bellefontaine as the only federal outpost in the territory. Several skirmishes were fought in Missouri, including the Battle of the Sink Hole near present-day Old Monroe, one of the last battles of the war, on May 24, 1815.

Among the developments in Missouri during the war was the creation of militia units, known as Missouri Rangers, who patrolled the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. These units were created by local citizens concerned about the lack of efforts by the federal government to defend the territory; although they primarily served in a defensive capability, they at times provided the backbone of offensive expeditionary forces.

===Statehood and early politics===

In November 1818 the Missouri territorial legislature adopted a request for statehood, and it submitted the request to the U.S. Congress in December 1818. However, what would otherwise have been a routine admission became mired in a national controversy due to Northern U.S. opposition to slavery&#x27;s continuing growth and expansion, which conflicted with a growing Southern white defense of slavery. When the bill authorizing Missouri to write a state constitution came before the House of Representatives, antislavery members of Congress led by New Yorker James Tallmadge attached amendments to the legislation that i)prohibited the further introduction of slaves into Missouri from other states ii)required the emancipation of all slaves born in Missouri after statehood at the age of 25. In effect, northern, antislavery Congressmen tried to force a plan of gradual abolition on Missouri as a condition of statehood. Similar to the gradual abolition laws that had mostly eradicated slavery from the northern states over the previous fifty years, these gradual abolition provisions would have resulted in the slow and gradual abolition of slavery in Missouri over the next fifty years. The restrictions on slavery passed the House of Representatives but failed in the Senate, where southern senators repeatedly blocked the measure. The &quot;Missouri Crisis&quot; was resolved at first in 1820 when the Missouri Compromise cleared the way for Missouri&#x27;s entry to the union as a slave state. The Missouri Compromise stated that the remaining portion of the Louisiana Territory above the 36°30′ line was to be free from slavery. This same year, the first Missouri constitution was adopted. The following year, 1821, Missouri was admitted as the 24th state, with the state capital temporarily located in Saint Charles until a permanent capital could be built. Missouri was the first state entirely west of the Mississippi River to be admitted to the Union. The state capital moved to Jefferson City in 1826.

At the time of its admission, the western border of Missouri was a straight line from Iowa to Arkansas based on the confluence of the Kaw River with the Missouri River in the Kansas City West Bottoms. Land in what is now northwest Missouri was deeded to the Iowa (tribe) and the combined Sac (tribe) and Fox (tribe). Following encroachments on the land by white settlers – most notably Joseph Robidoux — William Clark persuaded the tribes to agree give up their land in exchange for $7,500 in the 1836 Platte Purchase. The land was ratified by Congress in 1837. The purchase received widespread support from Southern Congressmen since it would mean adding territory to the only slave state north of Missouri&#x27;s southern border. An area only somewhat smaller than the combined area of Rhode Island and Delaware was added to Missouri. It consisted of the Andrew, Atchison, Buchanan, Holt, Nodaway and Platte counties.

===Connections and commerce===
Southern whites of the planter class poured into Missouri Territory during 1804–21, forcing many enslaved African Americans to migrate with them. The rapid population growth was facilitated by treaties that extinguished Indian land titles, with settlers attracted by the abundance of high quality inexpensive land, and the easy access provided by the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Land was especially accessible due to the circulation of Spanish land grants issued prior to 1803, land grants issued to U.S. soldiers, and relief grants issued by the federal government in response to the New Madrid earthquake of 1811. By 1810 European Americans dominated the population of Missouri&#x27;s river valleys, demographically, and financially. They overwhelmed the small French-speaking element and sent Native Americans to lands further west. Land in the public domain was quickly surveyed and sold to yeoman farmers, slaveholders, and aspiring slaveholders. Agricultural production in Missouri was heavily dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans. The agricultural surplus produced by Missouri farms was often sold downriver to plantation societies in the lower Mississippi Valley.

The best agricultural lands lay along the Missouri River, and they attracted wealthy farmers, often slaveowners from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, who envisioned the development of commercial agriculture, using the excellent river transportation system to market crops. As Douglas Hurt has argued, based on research by Jeff Bremer, the ownership of land meant more than financial opportunity:
:Landownership provided economic security, served as a badge of independence and citizenship, and gave farmers control over a dependent labor force of children, wives and slaves.

St. Louis, the principal city of the upper territory, was situated at the confluence of major northern and western waterways; second, it had several merchants who could outfit an expedition; and third, it was an entrepot of information and experienced travelers who might be hired to assist any group. After the departure of Lewis and Clark for the West, a second expedition, led by Zebulon Pike, explored the northern reaches of the Mississippi River in 1805; upon his return in 1806, Pike led another expedition to the southern and western reaches of the Arkansas River. The Pike Expedition of 1806 wintered in the mountains of Colorado, then turned to Spanish territory where the group was held prisoner until 1808. A final expedition of note that departed from St. Louis was that of Stephen Harriman Long, who ventured up the Platte River in 1820 (after participating in the Yellowstone Expedition of 1819) and described the Great Plains as the &quot;Great Desert&quot;.

The Mississippi-Ohio river systems were navigated by steamboat starting in 1811 with the &quot;New Orleans&quot; steamboat travelling from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to New Orleans. On December 16, 1811, the New Madrid earthquakes smashed the lightly populated region. In 1817, the first steamboat reached Saint Louis. That year, the commerce from New Orleans to the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville was carried in barges and keel-boats having a capacity of 60 to 80 tons each, with 3 to 4 months required to make a single trip. In 1820 steamboats were making the same trip in 15 to 20 days, by 1838 in 6 days or less. By 1834 there were 230 steamboats, having an aggregate tonnage of 39,000 tons, engaged in trade on the Mississippi. Large numbers of flat boats, especially from the Ohio and its tributaries, continued to carry produce downstream. In 1842 Ohio completed an extensive canal system that connected the Mississippi with the Great Lakes. These were in turn connected in 1825 by the Erie Canal with the Hudson River and the Port of New York on the Atlantic Ocean. There was expansive growth of resource commodity, and agricultural products trade throughout the rivers and Great Lakes network.

The population of the Mississippi River region served by St Louis increased rapidly to about 4 million people in 1860. With railroads just beginning to be important in the late 1850s, the riverboat traffic dominated the transportation and trade worlds, and St. Louis flourished at the center, with connections east along the Ohio, Illinois, Cumberland and Tennessee rivers, west along the Missouri River, and north and south along the Mississippi.

In 1845 St. Louis was connected by telegraph to the east coast. The same year, the first banks and colleges west of the Mississippi were established. The business leadership of St. Louis consisted primarily of Yankees from East, along with some Southerners. Much of the working class, especially the craftsman, were German immigrants. The politicians were Southerners and Irish Catholic immigrants.

After the California Gold Rush began in 1848, Saint Louis, Independence, Westport and especially Saint Joseph became departure points for those joining wagon trains to the West. They bought supplies and outfits in these cities to make the six-month overland trek to California, earning Missouri the nickname &quot;Gateway to the West&quot;. This is memorialized by the Gateway Arch in St. Louis.

In 1848 Kansas City was incorporated on the banks of the Missouri River. In 1860, the Pony Express began its short-lived run carrying mail from Saint Joseph to Sacramento, California.

In the 1820s northeastern Missouri saw a large influx of farmers, especially from the Bluegrass region of Kentucky. They introduced the upper South agricultural-economic pattern, with its mix of hog and corn production practiced by small-scale farmers and cattle and tobacco production practiced by large-scale farmers. Families typically moved to the region not as solitary units but as elements of large kin-based networks that maintained geographic integrity by purchasing clustered tracts of land.

Missouri was nationally famous for the quality and quantity of its mules. The state produced a superior breed from Mexican and Eastern stock. Some were used on the western trails, and a larger number were used on southern plantations. The industry provided a full-time livelihood for a few traders, feeders and breeders, but it supplemented the income for a far larger number of farmers. Horses, which are larger and more expensive to maintain, but which can do more work, remained the favorite animal on Missouri farms.

===Religion and society in early Missouri===
After the transfer of Louisiana to the United States, state support for the Catholic Church ended, while restrictions on Protestant groups were also eliminated. With the removal of financial support, most priests left the territory, and the Catholic parishioners were without a leader from 1804 to 1818. One institution of Catholic learning, St. Louis Academy (later Saint Louis University), was established in 1818 as the first college west of the Mississippi River.

After the installation of Louis William Valentine Dubourg as the Catholic bishop in 1818, however, Catholicism experienced a resurgence in the territory, characterized by the formation in the area of orders of the Society of the Sacred Heart, the Congregation of the Mission, and the Society of Jesus. Within months of his arrival, DuBourg had ordered the groundbreaking for a new cathedral in St. Louis, now known as the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France. DuBourg also encouraged the establishment of schools both for white settlers and for the indigenous peoples, such as the Academy of the Sacred Heart in St. Charles, which was established by Rose Philippine Duchesne in 1818. DuBourg also played a role in the establishment of several parish churches throughout Missouri. DuBourg&#x27;s successor, Joseph Rosati, continued to champion the expansion of the Catholic church in Missouri; in 1828, the Sisters of Charity opened the first hospital in Missouri (and west of the Mississippi River), while the Sisters of St. Joseph opened the first asylum for the deaf and dumb at Carondelet in 1838.

Immigration from Ireland and Germany expanded the reach of the Catholic church as well in the decades after statehood. During the 1830s, Catholic German communities settled in Cole, Gasconade, Maries, and Osage counties.

During the territorial period, Protestant churches expanded rapidly with the lifting of restrictions on their preaching. Baptist, Presbyterian and Methodist itinerant ministers arrived in waves, holding outdoor services in summers and organizing churches for permanent worship. Most early Protestant churches were established in rural Missouri: the first Baptist church in the territory was organized in 1805 near Cape Girardeau, the first Methodist church was organized near Jackson in 1806; the first Presbyterian church was organized ten miles south of Potosi in 1816; and the first Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) was organized in Howard County in 1817. The only Protestant church not to place its beginnings in rural Missouri was the Episcopal Church, which organized its first congregation in St. Louis in 1819.

The early Baptist church in Missouri had its origins in the ministry of John Mason Peck and James E. Welch, who were sent to the territory by the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions. In addition to establishing churches in rural Missouri, they founded the first Sunday school in St. Louis for whites and another for blacks in 1818. The black Sunday school membership grew quickly and led to the establishment of the first black Baptist church in Missouri in 1827. Growth of the Baptist church continued throughout the antebellum period; in 1834, there were 150 established Baptist churches, and by 1860, there were 750.

Although the first Methodist congregation was established in 1806 near Jackson, it was not until 1819 that a formal chapel was built to house services. The chapel, known as McKendree Chapel, was named for the first Methodist elder in the territory and is the oldest extant Protestant church in the state. Much of the Methodist growth can be attributed to their embrace of the camp meeting style of religious services. In this form, travelers and locals would set up tents surrounding a circular area of outdoor seating; emotional outbursts and passionate preaching characterized the service itself.

The Presbyterians and Congregationalists worked together in the territory and the state until 1852, establishing churches for both white settlers and indigenous peoples in the western part of the state. Neither grew as rapidly as the Methodists and the Baptists, but they nonetheless made contributions to the state in the form of education and cultural life. The &quot;founder and father of Presbyterianism&quot; in Missouri was Salmon Giddings, who established twelve churches in the state, including the first Protestant church in St. Louis. The first wholly separate Congregationalist church was established by a former Presbyterian congregation in St. Louis in 1852 under the leadership of T.M. Post.

Congregations formed at the cusp of and after Missouri statehood included the Episcopal church, which organized in December 1819, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which arrived in 1830, Lutherans, who arrived during the 1830s, and a Jewish group, which began holding services in 1836. The first Episcopal church, which raised funds to build a chapel in 1819, struggled after its rector departed in 1821; not until Thomas Horrel arrived as rector in 1825 did the church begin to expand again. Under Horrel&#x27;s leadership, the group built a brick chapel in 1830. In 1844, the Episcopal Diocese of Missouri separated from the diocese of Indiana, and Cicero Hawks became the first bishop of Missouri. Although Hawks faced several difficulties as leader of the Episcopalians until his death in 1868, an Episcopal cathedral in St. Louis was built during his tenure.

Two groups of Lutherans arrived in Missouri during the 1830s, both owing to German immigration of the period. The first group, which arrived in the mid-1830s, organized themselves as the Evangelical Synod of North America in 1840 to link several scattered Lutheran congregations. In 1849 the Synod opened a seminary to supply the group with liberal pastors; Eden Seminary initially opened in Warren County and later moved to Webster Groves. A second group of Lutherans came to Missouri in 1839; this group, mainly from Saxony, settled in Perry County under the leadership of Martin Stephan and later under Carl Walther. Eventually the group formed what is today the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.

===Mormons===
The earliest &quot;Mormons&quot; (members of the new Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) arrived in 1830 near Independence, Missouri. Joseph Smith, the leader of the church, and a group of his followers moved to Independence in 1831. Smith announced that, by revelation, he had been told that the area around Independence was to become Zion and a place of gathering. By 1833, one-third of the population of Jackson County were Mormons, totaling some 1,200 followers.

Within two years relations between Mormons and non-Mormons had become hostile. Much of this was derived from the Mormon practice of purchasing large tracts of land and openly intending to dominate the area, which aroused suspicion from nonbelievers (open claims by the Mormons that the area was given to them by God only worsened the situation). In addition, the Mormon population would vote in blocks and typically trade only among themselves, and they espoused abolitionist views. In July 1833, a community meeting of non-Mormons was held at the Independence courthouse to describe the grievances against the Mormons; at the meeting, the group agreed to a declaration that all Mormons were banned from the county. When the Mormon community refused to accept the declaration, mobs attacked the local Mormon press and two Mormon leaders, Edward Partridge and Charles Allen, were tarred and feathered.

Initially the Mormon group responded to the violence with a hasty agreement to depart; however, after receiving reassurances from Missouri Governor Daniel Dunklin to provide protection, the Mormons brought a larger group of settlers to the area and reneged on their forced agreement. Enraged at the decision, anti-Mormon groups attacked the Mormon community again in October 1833; when the state courts and militia refused to provide the protection, most Mormons departed the Independence area by early 1834. For the next three years, most Mormons lived in nearby Clay County; however, in 1836, the local people again demanded the Mormons leave. This time, Mormon lobbyists arranged for the state to create Caldwell County to the north as a Mormon refuge, where the Mormons established the town of Far West. Far West and Caldwell County quickly became a destination for Mormon settlers, along with neighboring Carroll and Daviess counties.

In 1838 hostility erupted again between the Mormons and non-Mormons, in what became known as the 1838 Mormon War. Beginning from an election dispute in which non-Mormons attempted to suppress the Mormon vote in Daviess County, open fighting broke out, in which a number of people, including civilians, were killed. Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs raised a state militia unit to attack the Mormons, and he issued Missouri Executive Order 44, which read in part:

After learning of the involvement of the state militia, the Mormon forces surrendered and many Mormon religious leaders, including Joseph Smith, were jailed. After several trials, Smith and the other leaders were allowed to escape, and he and his church moved to Illinois to form the city of Nauvoo in 1839. The treatment received by the Mormons from Missourians was particularly intolerant, and is considered by historian Duane G. Meyer as &quot;one of the sorriest episodes in the history of the state.&quot; Despite their poor treatment, Missouri still holds many sites considered significant by Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the related Community of Christ.

===Schools and the press===
The small historically French settlements that became part of the United States in 1803 had limited schooling. Small schools were established in several Missouri towns; by 1821, they existed in the towns of St. Louis, St. Charles, Ste. Genevieve, Florissant, Cape Girardeau, Franklin, Potosi, Jackson, and Herculaneum, and in rural areas in both Cooper and Howard counties. They were proprietary schools run by itinerant teachers who catered to boys of families who could pay small stipends, and usually provide room and board for the teacher. A few coeducational schools existed in some rural areas by the 1830s. Eleven schools for girls also operated during the territorial period, but these focused on basic literacy and homemaking practices.

In the decades after statehood, Missouri experienced rapid growth in newspaper and book publishing. From 1820 to 1860 the number of newspapers in the state expanded from 5 to 148, with the greatest growth coming during the 1850s. But early newspapers suffered the perennial problem of slowness, a problem only resolved with the arrival of the telegraph in 1847. Newspapers often included lengthy didactic lectures, poetry, and serial narratives and clippings from other papers. After 1847 the newspapers provided news within one day from across the country.

After 1825 most Missouri newspapers began to side openly either in favor of or against President Andrew Jackson and his policies. Two significant newspapers from the period were the &quot;Missouri Statesman&quot;, published in Columbia by William Switzler, and the &quot;Missouri Democrat&quot;, published in St. Louis. The &quot;Statesman&quot; was a powerful political force in central Missouri, and it strongly advocated for the Whig Party, while the &quot;Democrat&quot; supported Jacksonian Democratic politics until the 1850s, when it switched its support and advocated for the nascent Republican Party. Democratic papers rallied to Thomas Hart Benton, including the &quot;St. Louis Union&quot; and the &quot;Jefferson City Enquirer&quot;. The &quot;Hannibal Journal&quot;, which employed Samuel Clemens as a typesetter. The &quot;St. Louis Observer&quot;, which was the press of Elijah Lovejoy, an early abolitionist.

A few primarily St. Louis-based papers printed in German or French. Among the earliest of these was the &quot;Anzeiger des Westens&quot;, a German publication begun in 1835 that supported Benton&#x27;s politics. Other influential publications included the German-language &quot;Westliche Post&quot;, which began publishing in St. Louis in 1857, the Hermann &quot;Volksblatt&quot;, begun in 1854, and the French-language &quot;La Revue de l&#x27;Ouest&quot;, which began in St. Louis in 1854.

Literature in Missouri often took the form of nonfiction travelogues and biographies, or of collections of fictional short stories centered on life on the frontier. Thomas Hart Benton&#x27;s biography of thirty years in government was popular, and Henry Boernstein&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of St. Louis&quot; was reviewed in local publications.

===Slavery and Bleeding Kansas===

In the decades after the Louisiana Purchase the population of black slaves increased substantially in Missouri, particularly during the 1820s and 1830s. The proportion of slaves in the state population peaked at 18 percent in 1830; by 1860 the proportion was 9.8 percent, following heavy Irish and German immigration from the 1840s, as well as continued migration from the eastern United States. In St. Louis, nine percent of the 14,000 residents in 1840 were slaves, while only one percent of the 57,000 residents were enslaved in 1860. Although few Missouri families owned slaves, many whites of Southern origin supported the institution of slavery and thought that freeing the slaves would be a calamity for both whites and Blacks. Before 1830, slaves in Missouri cost less than $500, but as demand for slaves increased in the plantation South, by the 1850s, field slaves routinely sold for more than $1,000 each.
In most of the state slavery was unprofitable and little practiced, and the enslaved population was heavily concentrated along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Despite this, slavery was a significant element of Missouri society, and slave labor played an integral role in the development of the state. Wealthy planters from Kentucky and Tennessee moved into the Little Dixie region in the central part of the state, where they bought up large tracts of fertile land and brought in slaves to do the work of growing hemp and tobacco.

Missouri laws regarding slavery, like many other slave states, treated the enslaved as property that could be bought and sold. Although the Missouri Constitution of 1820 required that the legislature enact laws to ensure humane treatment of the enslaved, and in 1825 the legislature adopted a slave code governing treatment, in practice most of the enslaved had no protection under the law; a Black could not give testimony against a white. Brandings, beatings, rape, and family separation were not uncommon physical abuses, but the slave system also created mental and intellectual barriers that were equally abusive. Later laws relating to slavery included an 1847 law prohibiting teaching reading or writing to the enslaved and banning free Blacks from entering the state. Other legal restrictions included that the enslaved could not own property without permission from an owner, they could not buy or sell liquor, and they could not marry legally. Finally, the enslaved were also prohibited from serving as witnesses against whites, and they were prohibited from holding assemblies, including church services, without permission and without a white person in attendance. The Missouri legislature also adopted several laws to combat rising abolitionist and rebellious tendencies: in 1837, exciting slaves to rebellion was made punishable by fine and punishment; also in 1837, township patrols were established to monitor slave activities. In 1843, illegally transporting a slave from the state was made a class of grand larceny.

Despite the harsh realities of the slavery system, slave owners in Missouri sometimes displayed genuine concern for their slaves. This was in large part connected to the nature of slavery in Missouri, which had an especially intimate quality; owners directly oversaw their slaves (without overseers), worked alongside them every day, and lived in the same or adjacent houses. In some cases, the intimacy was displayed in a variety of ways: William Jewell was buried next to his slaves, while other owners freed them (including Ulysses S. Grant). Owners sometimes claimed this intimacy made for a milder version of bondage; some slaves, who expressed fear of being sold further South, agreed. Others, such as enslaved African American William Wells Brown, vehemently disagreed. As Wells wrote of his time as a slave in St. Louis, &quot;Though slavery is thought, by some, to be mild in Missouri, when compared with the cotton, sugar, and rice-growing States, yet no part of our slave-holding country is more noted for the barbarity of its inhabitants, than St. Louis.&quot; In the end, whether slaves experienced harsh or less harsh treatment from enslavers was immaterial. Slavery and white supremacy were systems that gave enslavers and all white people enormous power over the lives of African Americans. Mutti Burke, looking microscopically at slaves living on farms and town along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, is able to study the economics of slavery, relations between slaves and owners, the challenges faced by slave families and how they raised their children, sociability among enslaved and free Missourians, and the collapse of slavery during the Civil War.

Like other slave states, Missouri had a small free Black population. African Americans who became free did so most frequently by initiating freedom suits. African Americans would often claim they were legally entitled to freedom due to residence in a free state or territory. By the 1830s, a few hundred enslaved African-American men or women had gained their freedom through these lawsuits. By the mid-19th century, this population had increased as a result of manumission by slave owners. Certain protections existed for free Blacks; in 1824, the Supreme Court of Missouri ruled that free Blacks could not be re-enslaved. However, this protection was not well enforced, and free Blacks lived in danger of kidnapping enslavement by unscrupulous traders, using false documents. In 1846, a court case began that would decide the rights of free blacks and slaves alike: &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;. Dred and Harriet Scott, who were slaves, sued for freedom in St. Louis Circuit Court based on the premise that they had previously lived in a free state and territory. The case continued until 1857, when it culminated in a landmark United States Supreme Court decision. In the decision, Chief Justice Roger Taney and five other justices denied Scott his freedom, but also declared that no Blacks were entitled to citizenship, Blacks had &quot;no rights that a white man is bound to respect&quot;, and that Congress had no power to restrict slavery in the territories. The overturning of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 essentially prevented Congress from halting the expansion of slavery into the rest of the United States.

Critics of slavery in Missouri focused on two elements: family separation and the slave trade. The major slave market of St. Louis was held at the eastern doors of the courthouse, and several contemporary sources record family separation there; one St. Louisan recorded that a woman there frequently bought infant slaves from the arms of their mothers to raise and sell at a profit later. By the mid-1850s, some Missouri slave owners were selling surplus slave labor to the growing cotton-growing states of Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas.

Outspoken opponents of slavery, though a small minority in Missouri before the Civil War convinced many people that slavery had to end. Two main groups spoke out against slavery: New Englanders, especially ministers, journalists, and politicians; and German Americans. They were usually based in or near St Louis. Among these opponents was John Clark, an anti-slavery Methodist itinerant preacher who lived in Missouri during its territorial period. Others, such as Presbyterian minister David Nelson, first president of Missouri&#x27;s first college, Marion College, spoke against slavery and were forced to leave the state in 1836. Elijah Lovejoy, a Presbyterian minister and newspaper editor, was forced to leave, his press destroyed, after criticizing the judge and the mob in the burning of Francis McIntosh in April 1836. George S. Park, founder of Parkville, Missouri, published his antislavery views in the local &quot;Parkville Luminary&quot; in 1855; in response, his newspaper offices were raided by a mob and its presses were destroyed.

Missouri politicians who opposed slavery took care to avoid political repercussions. During the late 1820s, a meeting was held in Missouri, which both Senator Thomas Hart Benton and Senator David Barton attended, which was to have produced an emancipation plan for the state. However, the plan was abandoned quickly afterward due to an incident in New York that provoked racial tensions. Not until the 1850s would antislavery policy again be discussed openly among political leaders in the state. These politicians were affiliated with Benton, but went beyond his desire to stop the spread of slavery and instead sought its abolition. Among these were the St. Louisans B. Gratz Brown, Henry Boernstein, and Frank Blair, who were representative of the heavily liberal, German population of their city.

The Underground Railroad, an informal network of operations to remove slaves to freedom, operated within Missouri during the 1840s and 1850s. Initial destinations out of Missouri included Cairo, Galesburg, Godfrey, Quincy, and Sparta in Illinois; Cincinnati, Tabor, and Grinnell in Iowa; and Fort Scott and Osawatomie in Kansas. Among the successful attempts to free slaves was conducted by John Brown in December 1858. While living at the Osage Settlement, Brown was approached by a slave who asked for help in freeing his family; the next night, Brown led a raid into Vernon County, Missouri, then freed eleven slaves and led them to Canada. Another raid was conducted by John Doy, a Kansas physician, in Buchanan County, Missouri in July 1859. Doy was initially successful in freeing a group of slaves, but his group was captured and he was jailed at St. Joseph. A band of Kansans, including Silas Soule, broke into the jail and freed Doy before he began to serve his prison sentence. More general statements about the success of the Underground Railroad in the state are difficult to make with accuracy, but the frequent complaints among the population against those assisting runaways indicates the practice occurred with some frequency.

====Bleeding Kansas 1854-1857 ====

In 1854 Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas proposed a bill organizing the Kansas and Nebraska territories and allowing the people of the territories to decide through popular sovereignty whether to permit slavery. The bill, known as the Kansas–Nebraska Act, passed both houses and was signed by Franklin Pierce on May 30. Missouri Democrats and Whigs alike supported the bill, except for Thomas Hart Benton and a few of his key supporters. Several Missouri politicians, including Senator David R. Atchison and former Attorney General B.F. Stringfellow, encouraged Missourians to settle in the newly opened lands in 1854 as a bulwark against antislavery settlers arriving from New England. As early as June 1854, suggestions were made by proslavery groups that only armed resistance would prevent the antislavery forces from overtaking Kansas.

Although the territorial governor of Kansas had declared that only Kansas residents be permitted to vote, some 1,700 Missourians crossed the border in November 1854 to vote in the Congressional election. Although only 2,800 ballots were cast, it is likely the proslavery candidate would have been elected without the Missourians&#x27; voter fraud. In the March 1855 election to select the territorial legislature, more than 4,000 Missourians entered Kansas to cast ballots; even the University of Missouri sent a student delegate to cast in favor of slavery. According to the polls, 6,307 persons had voted, although Kansas had at the time only 2,095 eligible voters.

By 1855 antislavery immigrants began arriving in force to Kansas, and upon arrival they refused to acknowledge the fraudulently elected proslavery government. The antislavery groups elected their own government, with its capital at Topeka by December 1855; however, the proslavery government at Lecompton remained the legally recognized government of the state. Determined to hold the state for slavery, Missourians led by Senator Atchison formed armed bands to resist further immigration to Kansas. Known as Border Ruffians, the groups began stopping steamboats heading through Missouri to Kansas, searching them, and removing weapons they found. In December 1855, a band of Missourians from Clay County seized weapons and ammunition from the federal arsenal at Liberty, Missouri; federal officials successfully obtained the return of most of the weapons, but they made no arrests in the incident.

During the years of 1855 and 1856, tensions erupted into open warfare between proslavery and antislavery forces along the border. In May 1856, a group of Missourians sacked the town of Lawrence, Kansas; the town&#x27;s hotel, printing press, and several houses were destroyed, and several Kansans were killed. In response to the sacking, a group of Missouri settlers were attacked and massacred at Pottawatomie Creek in Kansas by John Brown and his group of abolitionists. In response to the killing, a group of Missourians known as the Westport Sharpshooters attempted to capture Brown, but they were themselves captured by him. In August 1856, however, another group of proslavery Missourians invaded Kansas and burned the town of Ossawotamie, which was home to Brown&#x27;s headquarters.

By 1857 a substantial population of antislavery settlers had arrived in Kansas, and their votes overwhelmed those of the proslavery Missourians who crossed the border for the October territorial election. Despite the victory of the antislavery forces at the ballot box, violence continued along the border of Missouri and Kansas. In several cases, antislavery groups from Kansas, known as Jayhawkers, invaded Missouri and attacked Missouri proslavery settlements in Bates, Barton, Cass, and Vernon counties. Intermittent attacks continued on both sides even after the Civil War.

==Civil War and Reconstruction (1861–1874)==

The population of the Mississippi River region served by St Louis increased rapidly to about 4 million people in 1860. With railroads just beginning to be important in the late 1850s, the riverboat traffic dominated the transportation and trade worlds, and St. Louis flourished at the center, with connections east along the Ohio, Illinois, Cumberland and Tennessee rivers, west along the Missouri River, and north and south along the Mississippi.

===Elections and the Camp Jackson Affair===
Beginning in 1852 the party structure and political governance of Missouri, like much of the country, underwent significant changes. In the gubernatorial elections of 1852, the Democratic candidate Sterling Price won office as a slaveowner and well-known veteran of the Mexican–American War. Price strongly supported the efforts of pro-slavery Missourians in Kansas, and he served as governor until 1857. During his term, the Whig Party collapsed, and in the 1856 election for governor, Trusten Polk won election as the leader of an anti-Benton faction of Democrats. But only a month into his term, Polk resigned the governorship upon being selected senator from Missouri. In the special election that followed, Benton Democrats and former Whigs joined in support of James S. Rollins, but he was ultimately defeated in a close election by another anti-Benton Democrat, Robert M. Stewart. Stewart&#x27;s term as governor was relatively uneventful; his administration stressed the importance of both the Union and the institution of slavery. Perhaps his most notable actions were in preserving the state&#x27;s nascent railroad system in the face of foreclosures, despite its financial shortcomings.

In April 1860 Claiborne Fox Jackson secured the Democratic Party nomination for Missouri governor in a close intraparty convention vote. In mid-1860, Jackson officially supported the Northern Democrat Stephen A. Douglas for president, although he personally sympathized with the Southern Democrat John C. Breckinridge. Because of his decision, Southern Democrats nominated their own slate for Missouri governor and lieutenant governor. In addition to the Breckinridge Southern Democrats, Jackson faced the newly formed Republican Party, which had a major base of support among the Germans of St. Louis. However, Jackson&#x27;s major opponent in the general election was the Constitutional Union Party nominee Sample Orr. In the August 1860 gubernatorial election, Jackson defeated Orr, the Breckinridge Southern Democrat nominee, and the Republican nominee by a large margin.

Running up to the November election for president, Jackson continued to support Stephen Douglas, but he made no effort to campaign for him in Missouri. Ultimately, Douglas won the state in the 1860 presidential election by a margin of 429 votes over John Bell, the Constitutional Unionist. In early December, most of Missouri&#x27;s banks suspended payment in specie given the political uncertainty surrounding South Carolina&#x27;s withdrawal from the union. The effect of the economic turmoil was high unemployment in St. Louis and a scarcity of currency in the surrounding area. During Jackson&#x27;s January 1861 inaugural address, he blamed Northern abolitionists for the crisis facing the United States, and he claimed to hope that the Union would not coerce South Carolina to withdraw its secession. He requested a convention to decide Missouri&#x27;s future and to debate the merits of secession, and he immediately called up the state militia. His lieutenant governor, Thomas Caute Reynolds, began working to organize the militia force in preparation for secession. He led a secessionist meeting on the day following the inauguration at which it was decided that St. Louis held the key to control of the state, while control of St. Louis depended upon control of its federal arsenal.

The secessionists&#x27; great rivals for control of St. Louis were Frank P. Blair, a Free Soil Party congressman, and Oliver D. Filley, the Free Soil mayor of the city. After Lincoln&#x27;s election, Blair began organizing the Republican Wide Awake clubs, which had been primarily composed of antislavery Germans, with other pro-Union groups in the city into Home Guard military units. To combat the rise of these units, Reynolds convinced the legislature to create a state-appointed board to govern the St. Louis Police Department, effectively placing the police under state control. The board&#x27;s first appointments were made by Jackson at the end of March, and meanwhile, Reynolds went to St. Louis to recruit a secessionist military unit known as the Minute Men. The local militia commander began consultations with then-arsenal commander William H. Bell, who gave assurances that the arsenal would be turned over to the state forces.

When elections for representatives to the state convention called for by Jackson, voters overwhelmingly selected men running under pro-Union labels. No representatives were elected who called openly for secession, while four openly Republican representatives were elected from St. Louis. Two demographic factors generally led to this result: the relatively small population of slaveholders in Missouri, and the relatively large population of Northern and foreign-born immigrants to the state. Economically, the state was tied to the North via trade, with increasing overland trade on rail lines in Illinois, while the South offered little in terms of economic or military security to the state.

When the convention met in March 1861, it ultimately selected Hamilton R. Gamble, a retired lawyer, to write the report of its findings. In it, the convention noted that it approved of the Crittenden Compromise (despite its recent rejection by the U.S. Congress) and of a national convention to preserve slavery; it recommended that the federal government remove its forces from seceded states to avoid military conflict. The convention rejected recommending that the state join the Confederacy if the North rejected compromise and if other border states left the Union.

The beginning of hostilities at Fort Sumter led President Lincoln to request 75,000 volunteers from the states; however, Governor Jackson flatly rejected the request for 4,000 troops from Missouri. To fill the quota, Frank Blair offered the enlistment of the Home Guards to fill the quota, an offer which was accepted by the federal government. In its acceptance, the federals recalled U.S. Army departmental commander William S. Harney, who had been viewed by Blair as too slow to react to the threat of the militia. In his place was appointed Captain Nathaniel Lyon, who was much more aligned with Blair&#x27;s interests, and he arrived in February 1861.

Within weeks Lyon had sent surplus weapons from the arsenal to safer locations in Illinois and mustered an additional ten thousand soldiers under his command to defend the state. The state militia, under the control of Jackson and the secessionists, began training throughout the state after the legislature gave its approval on May 2. The militia commander requested artillery from the Confederate government and the state of Virginia, both of which accepted and began sending aid secretly up the Mississippi River. In an attempt to ascertain the strength of the encampment, Lyon entered under disguise, and, noting small Confederate flags and references to Jefferson Davis, decided to clear the camp using federal troops from the arsenal.

In what became known as the Camp Jackson Affair, Union forces marched to the militia camp (named for Governor Jackson), encircled it, and took the militia prisoners without a fight. While the soldiers were accompanying the prisoners back to the arsenal, a drunk civilian fired a pistol in the air, provoking the soldiers to fire upon the crowds that had gathered to observe the march. In the melee that followed, 28 civilians were killed and dozens of others were injured. After the shooting, many previously undecided Missourians came to a firm stance regarding the Union and secession; for Unionists in rural Missouri, this frequently meant a difficult position because of a lack of Union presence in the area.

===Early battles and the opening of war in Missouri===
After Camp Jackson the General Assembly felt pressed to act against the Union; it quickly passed laws bills enrolling all able men into the state militia and granting funds to it. Meanwhile, General Harney returned to St. Louis after having been captured by rebel forces in Virginia; he was released after refusing to align with them, then persuaded the War Department that he would hold Missouri in the Union. Upon his return to Missouri he retroactively approved Lyon&#x27;s capture of Camp Jackson, then secured warrants to search and seize illegal weapons in the area. He also sent forces to nearby Potosi to secure its supply of lead and the railroad line connecting it to St. Louis.

Jackson continued during mid-1861 to reorganize and train the state militia, which had taken on the name of the Missouri State Guard. Jackson named Sterling Price as the commander of the state guard, and he began organizing thousands of recruits into newly formed units. In response, Union supporters sent representatives to Washington to request that Lincoln stay the course and maintain Harney as the commander of Union forces in Missouri; others, particularly allies of Frank Blair, sought a more radical course and pushed for Harney&#x27;s replacement by Lyon. Ultimately, Lincoln initially decided to remove Harney only after several weeks had passed, in an effort to give him an opportunity to complete his moderate goals. Ultimately, however, he permitted Blair to remove Harney and appoint Lyon as the new Union commander whenever Blair saw fit.

Blair received this permission on May 20, the same day Harney concluded a negotiated settlement with Sterling Price regarding troop movements in Missouri. According to the agreement, Price would keep his militia out of Greater St. Louis, while Harney would refrain from troop movements into rural Missouri. In addition, Price dismissed most of the militia forces gathered in Jefferson City, excepting for some reserved to keep order. Historians differ on Price&#x27;s motivation for the agreement; some argue that he was attempting to slow the Union&#x27;s progress and desired to bring Missouri into the Confederacy, while others suggest he was genuine in his desire to prevent fighting. Despite the agreement, some companies of pro-Confederate forces remained in Jefferson City, Confederate flags flew at the Governor&#x27;s Mansion, and Jackson was secretly negotiating with agents from the Confederate government at Richmond. Pro-secessionists such as Lieutenant Governor Reynolds loathed the agreement between Price and Harney, and Reynolds distrusted Price&#x27;s loyalty for the remainder of the war.

Unionists in St. Louis also were perturbed by the agreement and reports indicating the harassment of outstate Unionists. Blair, reacting to pressure from the Unionist community, delivered the order removing Harney on May 30 and giving command to Lyon. Moderates on both sides continued to hope to prevent fighting and, in that vein, arranged a conference in St. Louis on June 11 among the leadership, including Jackson, Price, Blair, and Lyon. After several hours of arguing the right of the Union to recruit in outstate Missouri, Lyon decided that the meeting had come to an impasse. Standing from the group, Lyon spoke to Jackson and Price:

Jackson and Price quickly retreated to Jefferson City, planning their actions and only stopping to burn bridges at the Gasconade and Osage rivers. Ordering the state guard to renew preparations for war, Price determined that a capital at Boonville would be better defended than at Jefferson City, and state government removed from there on June 13. By June 15, Lyon captured an empty Jefferson City with 2,000 troops. Lyon immediately detached 300 troops to hold the capital and began pursuit of the Confederate state guard to Boonville.

Price and the main part of the Confederate militia, meanwhile, had moved from Boonville after hearing that Union forces had moved on Lexington, Missouri, which Price thought crucial to the success of secession in the state. Price also had fallen ill, and Governor Jackson and a state guard colonel remained to lead a small militia force of 400 to hold Boonville. Lyon and main Union force caught up with this remnant of the state guard, and the Union easily routed the secessionists at the Battle of Boonville. Price regrouped the remnants of the state guard and began a retreat to the southern border of Missouri.

In pursuit of Price and the state guard, Lyon ordered a St. Louis detachment commanded by Franz Sigel to move to southwest Missouri in an attempt to prevent Price&#x27;s guard from meeting with the army of Confederate General Benjamin McCulloch, then operating in Arkansas. In that vein, Sigel moved via the Pacific Railroad to Rolla, then marched on Springfield, which they occupied on June 23. Moving west from Springfield, Sigel&#x27;s forces encountered Jackson and his retreating army on July 7 at the Battle of Carthage. Outnumbered 4,000 to 1,000, the Union forces under Sigel were defeated and retreated to Springfield to wait for reinforcements from Lyon. The state guard forces under Price moved into camp at Cowskin Prairie, near Granby.

In the northwest from Fort Leavenworth, Samuel Sturgis led Union troops to St. Joseph, then headed south to Lexington in pursuit of Price. In northeastern Missouri, Iowan Union forces moved on Hannibal and secured the railroad line connecting the city to St. Joseph, thereby securing northern Missouri for the Union.

The majority of St. Louis business leaders supported the Union and rejected efforts by Confederate sympathizers to take control of the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce in January 1862. Federal authorities intervened in this struggle but the conflict splintered the Chamber of Commerce into two organizations. The pro-Unionists finally gained the ascendancy and St. Louis became a major supply base for the Union forces in the entire Mississippi Valley.

Shortly afterward the 12,000-man force of the combined elements of the Missouri State Guard, Arkansas State Guard, and Confederate regulars soundly defeated the Federal army of Nathaniel Lyon at Wilson&#x27;s Creek or &quot;Oak Hills&quot;.

Following the success at Wilson&#x27;s Creek, southern forces pushed northward and captured the 3500-strong garrison at the first Battle of Lexington. Federal forces contrived to campaign to retake Missouri, causing the Southern forces to retreat from the state and head for Arkansas and later Mississippi.

In Arkansas the Missourians fought at the battle of Pea Ridge, meeting defeat. In Mississippi, elements of the Missouri State Guard participated in the struggles at Corinth and Iuka, where they suffered heavy losses.

===Political upheaval during the war===
In 1861 Union General John C. Fremont issued a proclamation that freed slaves who had been owned by those that had taken up arms against the Union. Lincoln immediately reversed this unauthorized action. Secessionists tried to form their own state government, joining the Confederacy and establishing a Confederate government in exile first in Neosho, Missouri and later in Texas (at Marshall, Texas). By the end of the war, Missouri had supplied 110,000 troops for the Union Army and 40,000 troops for the Confederate Army.

During the Civil War Charles D. Drake, a former Democrat, became a fierce opponent of slavery, and a leader of the Radical Republicans. In 1861 to 1863 he proposed without success the immediate and uncompensated emancipation of slaves. He was defeated by the conservative Republicans led by Governor Hamilton Gamble and supported by President Abraham Lincoln. By 1863 Drake had built up his Radical faction and called for immediate emancipation, a new constitution, and a system of systematic disfranchisement of all Confederate sympathizers in Missouri.

===Later battles and guerrilla warfare in Missouri===

In 1864 Sterling Price plotted to attack Missouri, launching his 1864 raid on the state. Striking in the southeastern portion of the state, Price moved north, and attempted to capture Fort Davidson but failed. Next, Price sought to attack St. Louis but found it too heavily fortified. He then broke west in a parallel course with the Missouri River. The Federals attempted to retard Price&#x27;s advance through both minor and substantial skirmishing such as at Glasgow and Lexington. Price made his way to the extreme western portion of the state, taking part in a series of bitter battles at the Little Blue, Independence, and Byram&#x27;s Ford. His Missouri campaign culminated in the battle of Westport in which over 30,000 troops fought, leading to the defeat of the Southern army. The Missourians retreated through Kansas and Oklahoma into Arkansas, where they stayed for the remainder of the war.
In 1865, Missouri abolished slavery, doing so before the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, by an ordinance of immediate emancipation. Missouri adopted a new constitution, one that denied voting rights and had prohibitions against certain occupations for former Confederacy supporters.

Besides organized military conflict, Missouri was beset by guerrilla warfare. In such a bitterly divided state, neighbors frequently used the excuse of war to settle personal grudges and took up arms against neighbors. Roving insurgent bands such as Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders and the supporters of Bloody Bill Anderson terrorized the countryside, striking both military installations and civilian settlements. Because of the widespread guerrilla conflict, and support by citizens in border counties, Federal leaders issued General Order No. 11 in 1863, and evacuated areas of Jackson, Cass, and Bates counties. They forced the residents out to reduce support for the guerrillas. Union cavalry could sweep through and track down Confederate guerrillas, who no longer had places to hide and people and infrastructure to support them. On short notice, the army forced almost 20,000 people, mostly women, children, and the elderly, to leave their homes. Many never returned, and the affected counties were economically devastated for years after the end of the war. Families passed stories of their bitter experiences down through several generations.

Western Missouri was the scene of brutal guerrilla warfare during the Civil War, and some marauding units became organized criminal gangs after the war. In 1882, the bank robber and ex-Confederate guerrilla Jesse James was killed in Saint Joseph. Vigilante groups appeared in remote areas where law enforcement was weak, to deal with the lawlessness left over from the guerrilla warfare phase. For example, the Bald Knobbers were the term for several law-and-order vigilante groups in the Ozarks. In some cases, they too turned to illegal gang activity.

===Welfare===
The Western Sanitary Commission was a private agency based in St. Louis that was a rival of the larger U.S. Sanitary Commission. It operated during the war to help the U.S. Army deal with sick and wounded soldiers. It was led by abolitionists and especially after the war focused more on the needs of Freedmen. It was founded in August 1861, under the leadership of Reverend William Greenleaf Eliot (1811–87), a Yankee, to care for the wounded soldiers after the opening battles. It was supported by private fundraising in the city of St. Louis, as well as from donors in California and New England. Parrish explains it selected nurses, provided hospital supplies, set up several hospitals, and outfitted several hospital ships. It also provided clothing and places to stay for freedmen and refugees, and set up schools for black children. It continued to finance various philanthropic projects until 1886.

===Radicalism and Reconstruction===
In November 1864 national and statewide elections gave the Radical Republicans strong majorities. In the General Assembly, most newly elected representatives were relatively young farmers; 56 percent of Radicals were under 45, and 36 percent worked in agriculture. In congressional elections, all but one of the victors was a Republican, and voters passed a proposal for a state convention to rewrite the state constitution. Any person who had given any sort of indirect support to the Confederacy lost his vote and the right to hold office or practice a profession.

Drake served as vice president of the 1865 state constitutional convention, where he stood out as the most active leader. Republican leader Carl Schurz commented about him, &quot;in politics he was inexorable ... most of the members of his party, especially in the country districts, stood much in awe of him.&quot; The state convention began deliberating on January 7, 1865, in St. Louis; the group was, like the General Assembly, dominated by relatively young Radical Republicans. Among the first measures taken by the convention was the passage of an emancipation ordinance on January 11 that took effect immediately. It freed all of the slaves in Missouri, without compensation to the owners.

The new Constitution was adopted and became known as the &quot;Drake constitution.&quot; The Radicals maintained absolute control of the state from 1865 to 1871, with Drake as their leader. The new government replaced hundreds of locally elected officials and appointed their own officials to take control of local affairs. The Radicals disfranchised every man who had supported the Confederacy, even indirectly. They made an 81-point checklist of actions that could cause disfranchisement and imposed an Ironclad Oath on all professional men, and government officeholders.

It became a highly controversial political issue that split the Republican party. The German Republicans in particular were angry. Historians have emphasized the desire for power, revenge, and equal rights for blacks. The radicals had another goal as well: They used disfranchisement of ex-Confederates as a method of encouraging them to leave Missouri and to discourage southern whites with the same ideals from migrating into Missouri. The idea was that Missouri would attract Northerners and European immigrants, thus generating economic growth and social progress. In 1867 the United States Supreme Court held that the federal ironclad oath for attorneys and the similar Missouri state oath for ministers, lawyers teachers, and other professionals were unconstitutional, because they violated the constitutional prohibitions against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws.

To further bolster their voting base, the Radicals sought the franchise for all black men in Missouri. A statewide referendum in 1868, the Democrats were solidly negative, while Republicans split their vote, and black suffrage was defeated with 55,000 favor and 74,000 opposed. Missouri black men finally got the vote in 1870 with the passage of the 15th Amendment. Meanwhile, the Radical faction increasingly lost support inside Missouri to the Liberal Republicans led by Senator Carl Schurz and Governor Benjamin Gratz Brown.

===Return to political conservatism===
Radical rule alienated group after group, diminishing the strength of the Republican Party. One critical element were the German Americans, who had voted 80 percent for Lincoln in 1860, and who strongly supported the war effort. They were a bastion of the Republican Party in St. Louis and other immigrant strongholds. The German Americans were angered by a proposed state constitution that discriminating against Catholics and freethinkers. The requirement of a special loyalty oath for priests and ministers was troublesome. Despite their strong opposition the constitution was ratified in 1865. Racial tensions with the blacks began to emerge, especially in terms of competition for unskilled labor jobs. Germania was nervous about black suffrage in 1868, fearing that blacks would support puritanical laws Especially regarding the prohibition of beer gardens on Sundays. The tensions split off a large German element in 1872, which supported the Liberal Republican party led by Benjamin Gratz Brown for governor in 1870 and Horace Greeley for president in 1872. The split between the Radical Republicans and the Liberal Republicans proved fatal to the party. Most started to vote for the Democrats. Furthermore, the nationwide Panic of 1873 was a severe economic depression that undermined the Republican promises of prosperity. Violence grew much more serious, with many attacks on banks and trains. The farmers started to organize to protect their interests. In August 1874, the Democratic Party nominated Charles Henry Hardin as a compromise candidate for governor. They nominated agriculturalist Norman Jay Colman as candidate for lieutenant governor. He drew support from rural areas due to his endorsement of Free Silver and his desire to repeal the National Bank Act. The team was elected by a landslide and the Republican era was nearly over.

In May 1875 delegates drafted a conservative constitution to replace the Radical one of 1865. The majority of the delegates were conservative, well-educated, and generally had ties to the South. 35 of the 68 delegates either served with the Confederacy or were allied to its cause; the presiding officer, Waldo P. Johnson, had been expelled from the U.S. Senate in 1862 after he joined the Confederacy. The new constitution was a reaction against the radicalism of the 1860s and 1870s, and it encouraged local control and a reduction in the powers of the state. It limited the ability of the state and local governments to tax, and reduced the restrictions on churches being able to own property. It required a two-thirds vote by citizens to authorize the issuance of local government bonds, and it restricted the ability of state legislators to craft legislation that would benefit their localities. The proposal was submitted for popular vote on August 2, 1875, and the constitution passed overwhelmingly.

The &quot;Southernization&quot; of Missouri proceeded rapidly during the 1870s. Numerous memorials to the Confederacy and Confederate generals were erected around the state and there were calls to establish a veterans&#x27; home for disabled or indigent Confederate veterans as well as a Confederate cemetery. The Democrat-controlled state government presented a misleading image that Missouri had really been a Southern state all along instead of a Western or border state, even though over three times as many Missourians fought for the Union than fought for the Confederacy. In 1884, former Confederate general John S. Marmaduke was elected governor; he was also the nephew of the exiled Governor Claiborne.

==Industrialization and modernization (1872–1919)==
The Missouri economy grew steadily from the end of the war to the early 20th century. Railroads replaced the rivers, trains supplanted steamboats. From 817 miles of track in 1860, there were 2000 miles in 1870 and 8000 by 1909. Railroads built new towns as needed to provide repair and service facilities; the old river towns decline. Kansas City lacking a navigable river, became the rail center of the West, exploding from 4400 population 1860 to 133,000 by 1890. Cities of all sizes grew, as the proportion of Missourians living in communities over 2000 population jumped from 17 percent in 1860, to 38 percent in 1900. Coal mining providing the locomotives, factories, Stores and homes with fuel, grew rapidly, as did the lumbering industry in the Ozarks which provided the timber for cross ties and smaller bridges. St. Louis remained the number one railroad center, unloading 21,000 carloads of merchandise in 1870, 324,000 in 1890, and 710,000 in 1910. The total tonnage of freight carried on all Missouri railroads doubled and redoubled again from 20 million tons in 1881 to 130 million in 1904.

===Commercial revival and urban growth===

The most important economic change of late 19th century Missouri was the arrival and growth of railroads. The opening of Missouri to the national market by way of the railroad provided the impetus for specialization in nearly every commercial sector. It shifted the main traffic away from the river system to the East-West Valley system. Although the first railroads were built in Missouri during the 1850s, significant expansion began during the 1870s: between 1870 and 1880, Missouri trackage nearly doubled from 2,000 to 3,965 miles.

The railroad encouraged growth of surface roads; the arrival of the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway in Springfield in 1870 led to the establishment of several roads nearby that connected a region more than 100 miles across. Another outcome of railroad expansion was the dramatic increase in the population and wealth of urban Missouri. In Jefferson City, the neighborhood near the Pacific Railroad roundhouse became wealthy due to new businesses opening in the area, such as the Dulle Mills, the Jefferson City Gas Works, and the Jefferson City Produce Company. The town of Sedalia was itself platted because of the proximity to the Pacific Railroad, and the opening of the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad in the town only accelerated growth.

Of note during this period of activity was the U.S. Army&#x27;s investment in river management issues such as navigation, flood mitigation and commerce. The formal establishment of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers District at Saint Louis on February 19, 1872, signaled a significant effort by the federal government to provide regional leadership in the post Civil War era.

Among the rural towns of Missouri, Joplin experienced the greatest growth during the late 19th century, largely as a result of the discovery of iron ore near town in the early 1870s. A group of Joplin investors created a railroad line in 1877 to facilitate movement of iron and coal to the area; in 1879, the Joplin and Girard Railroad was sold to the St. Louis—San Francisco Railway. Nonexistent in 1870, Joplin&#x27;s population grew to 7,000 in 1880 and 10,000 in 1890. Another example of the rapid growth brought by the railroad was Cape Girardeau. As a result of the Panic of 1873, an early railroad venture there failed before construction began; however, railroad promoter and lawyer Louis Houck was employed to revamp the company, and in late 1880, Houck managed the completion of a 14.4-mile stretch connecting Cape Girardeau to the Iron Mountain Railroad. Houck continued to successfully expand the road, ultimately building more than 500 miles of track in southeast Missouri.
St. Louis and Kansas City grew dramatically during the decades after the Civil War. St. Louis in particular benefited from greater railroad connections after the construction of the Eads Bridge in 1874 across the Mississippi River. During the 1870s alone, the value of manufactured goods in St. Louis grew from $27 million to $114 million, and during the 1880s doubled again to $228 million. Among St. Louis&#x27;s greatest success stories was that of the Anheuser-Busch brewery, founded in the 1860s by Eberhard Anheuser, who partnered with his son-in-law Adolphus Busch. Busch pioneered pasteurization to keep beer fresh, and he marketed Anheuser-Busch products nationally using refrigerator cars and by providing saloons with free prints of a painting that included advertising for the company.

Kansas City also expanded rapidly during the period; its population increased from 3,500 in 1865 to more than 32,000 in 1870, largely due to the promotional efforts of Joseph G. McCoy. Kansas City became a hub for both meatpacking and wheat milling, and Armour &amp; Company became a major employer in the city. Canned beef production in Kansas City totaled nearly 800,000 tins in 1880, expanding to more than 4 million tins in 1890. By 1878, the city processed more than 9 million bushels of wheat a year, and in 1880, eleven railroad lines operated in the city.

====Decline of Southern trade====
During the Civil War the Federal government closed the Mississippi to ordinary commerce so that military traffic could move faster. When the war was over, the prosperity of the South was ruined. Hundreds of steamboats had been destroyed, and levees had been damaged by warfare and flooding. Much of the commerce of the West that before the war headed to New Orleans, via the Mississippi, now went to the East Coast via the Great Lakes and by the rapidly multiplying new lines of railways connecting through Chicago. Some revival of commerce on the Mississippi took place following the war, but this was checked by a sandbar at the mouth of the Southwest Pass in its delta on the Gulf of Mexico. Ead&#x27;s jetties created a new shipping passage at the mouth of the South Pass in 1879, but the facilities for the transfer of freight in New Orleans were far inferior to those employed by the railways, and the steamboat companies did not prosper.

===Agricultural changes and expansion===
Up to the 1880s the six southeastern counties of Missouri&#x27;s Bootheel – swampy and subject to flooding – remained heavily forested, underdeveloped, and underpopulated. Beginning in the 1880s, railroads opened up the Bootheel to logging. In 1905, the Little River Drainage District constructed an elaborate system of ditches, canals, and levees to drain swampland. As a result, population more than tripled from 1880 to 1930, and cotton cultivation flourished. By 1920 it was the chief crop, attracting newcomers to the farms from Arkansas and Tennessee.

The railroad brought significant changes to Missouri agriculture during the late 19th century, bringing both external markets for local crops and competition from producers in other parts of the United States. Norman J. Colman, an agriculturalist who served on the state Board of Agriculture from 1867 to 1903, encouraged Missouri farmers to adopt scientific farming techniques to compete in the national market. In 1870, Colman convinced the General Assembly to establish a College of Agriculture at the University of Missouri in Columbia, a process aided by state legislator and university curator James S. Rollins. The well-known agricultural researcher Jeremiah W. Sanborn served as the college&#x27;s second dean starting in 1882, and in 1883, the college sponsored dozens of agricultural institutes across Missouri to educate farmers on modern practices. Colman continued to encourage agriculture in Missouri after his appointment in 1885 as U.S. Commissioner of Agriculture (in 1888, Colman became the first Secretary of Agriculture when the department became a cabinet-level agency).

As a result of the efforts of Colman, Sanborn, and others at the University of Missouri, the number of Missouri farms experienced significant growth during the 1870s. At the beginning of the decade, the state had slightly less than 150,000 farms and 9.1 million acres of farmland; by 1880, there were more than 215,000 farms and 16.7 million acres of farmland. With the arrival of the railroad, some counties and towns experienced rapid growth: in 1870, rural Wayne County had no railroad connection, had 27,500 acres of farmland, and produced 290,000 bushels of corn. In the early 1870s, however the town of Piedmont in Wayne County was made a junction of the Iron Mountain Railroad, and production expanded dramatically; by 1880, the county had 47,000 acres of farmland and produced 525,000 bushels of corn. Piedmont itself went from an unplatted village in 1871 to a town of 700 residents by 1880, with professional and retail workers who made the town attractive to farmers.

Despite the growth brought by the railroads and new techniques, Missouri continued to undergo urbanization during the late 19th century. Labor-saving devices such as the sulky plow, corn planter, mower, and reaper made most farm laborers more productive, with a surplus moving to town. In addition, the competition brought by the railroad generally caused a decline in farm prices after 1873; in 1874, a bushel of Missouri corn sold for 67 cents, but its price dropped to 24 cents in 1875 and remained in the 20 to 40-cent range for most of the 1870s and 1880s. As a result, although the acreage of Missouri farmland had increased from 1870 to 1880, the value of crops produced saw a decline from $103 million to slightly less than $96 million in the same period.

In response to declining prices and opportunities for new scientific methods farmers began forming chapters of The Grange. Oliver Hudson, a U.S. Bureau of Agriculture employee, formed the first Missouri Grange chapter in 1870, and by 1875, Missouri led the nation with over 2,000 chapters. In addition to organizing social events for farmers and their wives, the Grange organized them economically by creating trade fairs and collective sales of farm produce, and the group opened no fewer than eight cooperative stores where goods could be bought at reasonable prices by Grange members. Grange stores operated in several market towns.

In spite of the efforts of the Grange, most Missouri farmers remained economically disadvantaged during the 1880s and 1890s. As it had during the 1870s, the number of farms and acreage under cultivation again increased in the 1880s and 1890s. However, roughly half of the state&#x27;s claimed land remained uncultivated in 1900, and in 1903, the state still had more than 400,000 acres of unclaimed federal land available under the Homestead Act. By 1900, urbanization had reduced the rural population to two-thirds of the state total, down from more than 75% at the close of the Civil War. After significant declines during the 1880s, land prices recovered slightly during the 1890s, although the market remained unstable and largely dependent on the particulars of the farm. Another factor in the continued economic issues of the farmer was the increasing availability of credit from eastern bankers; high interest rates frequently led to repossession of farmland and sheriff&#x27;s sales during the 1890s.

The late 19th century was a time of continuity in terms of crops produced in Missouri, with the majority of acreage given to the production of corn and wheat. In 1900, farmers devoted more than 7.5 million acres (of nearly 23 million total) to corn, although yields declined overall as less productive and fertile land was brought into use. Most corn in Missouri also was consumed in the state by livestock, and hay and pasture land for livestock made up 10.5 million acres of farmland in 1900. Livestock income provided 55% of farm income in 1900, or roughly $142 million.

The largest group of livestock consisted of swine, totalling 4.5 million in 1900, followed by cattle, which in 1899 totalled nearly 3 million. Missouri farmers produced 7% of the national total of hogs in 1900, and only Illinois and Iowa had larger herds. Sheep, goats, and turkeys were insignificant, although chicken raising was an important supplementary income for farmers during the 1890s; as with swine, the state ranked third among poultry raising states. Missouri mules remained nationally famous. From 1890 to 1900, mules in the state increased from 196,000 to nearly 250,000. During the Boer War from 1899 to 1902, the state shipped more than 100,000 mules to Britain, and the U.S. government purchased significant mule stocks during the Spanish–American War in 1898 and 1899.

====Ozark farming====
Before 1870 the original Ozark settlers in the southwest part of the state were part-time farmers, herders and hunters. During 1870–1900 the region became one of general full-time small farm operations, with diverse crops and livestock. Hunting and fishing became leisure activities, rather than a necessity for subsistence. After 1900 commercial agriculture increased and livestock production surpassed cultivation. The general farm of yore vanished. Only dairy farming survived the pressure of livestock production. By the 1970s, however, agriculture in the Ozarks had come full circle. Many modern farmers survived only by becoming part-time farmers. Much of the population commutes to paid employment for most of their income, in much the same way as the pioneers had been forced to diversify their efforts.

===Women, family and society===
In the early nineteenth century, Missouri had two divergent family styles—the French and the American. The French placed the mother at the head of the house; the Americans treated the mother as little more than a fellow-worker who often took second place to the men in the family. Most of the immigration to Missouri in the nineteenth century was of families, and women left diaries, letters, and memoirs documenting preparations for the journey, the nerve-wracking Atlantic crossing, and the long train rides from New York City to St. Louis and their final destinations. Most came from Germany, as well as Ireland, Bohemia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Jewish settlements in Eastern Europe. The largest groups were Catholic, Lutheran, and German. Once arrived, the women—mostly in their twenties—coped with the problems of daily life in an unfamiliar and occasionally hostile environment, with a limited network of kinfolk available to help. The normative standard for German American women was to be good, diligent, submissive, and silent housewives. The historical records show more variety, with many being cantankerous, complaining, and unwilling to subordinate themselves. These nonconformists exerted a greater influence on the community scene than they could by strict conformity to generally accepted behavior.

====Modernization====

Throughout the century most rural families lived traditional lifestyles, based on male dominance. Efforts to modernize rural life, and upgrade the status of women, were reflected in numerous movements, including Public schools, women&#x27;s church activities, temperance reform, and the campaign for woman suffrage. Reformers sought to modernize the rural home by transforming its women from producers to consumers. The Missouri Women Farmers&#x27; Club (MWFC) and its management was especially active. The great majority of women were full-time homemakers, whose labor created materials and clothing, food, agriculture and basics of life for their families. After the Civil War some women became wage earners in industrializing cities. It was common for widows to operate boardinghouses or small shops; younger women worked in tobacco, shoe, and clothing factories. Some women helped their husbands publish local newspapers, which flourished in every county seat and small city. In 1876, women began to attend the Missouri Press Association&#x27;s meetings; by 1896 the women formed their own press association, and at the end of the century, women were editing or publishing 25 newspapers in Missouri. They were especially active in developing features to entertain their women readers, and to help women with their housework and child-rearing.

====Schooling====
Before the Civil War Missouri followed the southern pattern that downplayed public schooling, as well-to-do families patronized local private academies. Ambitious but poor parents pooled their resources to hire part-time teachers for their children. During Reconstruction, the Radicals in power strongly favored modernization through the rapid growth in public schools. Their 1865 Constitution, and numerous state laws, called for a large network of public schools, including ones for black children. The plan was to require four months terms of schooling every year for children. Under the aggressive leadership of state superintendent of schools Thomas A. Parker, the number of public schools jumped from 48,000 in 1867 to 75,000 in 1870, as enrollment grew from 169,000 to 280,000. The 1870 totals included 9100 black students. About 59 percent of the eligible white children attended school annually in 1870, along with 21 percent of the eligible black children. Parker built up organizations of teachers at the county level, as well as the state level, holding numerous clinics to provide the pedagogical education the teachers lacked. New normal schools, to train teachers, were opened at Kirksville and Warrensburg in 1870. The all-black Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City opened an education department to train black teachers. A new state university was founded in Columbia, with land-grant federal aid. However it had to share some of that aid with the new school of mines at Rolla. The public school system across the state was heavily oriented toward providing the three Rs of elementary education. High schools were rare outside the major cities. Families that could afford to have children attend school rather than hold a paying job patronized 45 academies in 1870, most of which were attached to the 37 small private colleges. Most were run by religious denominations. St. Louis, under the leadership of William Torrey Harris as superintendent of schools 1868–1880, developed one of the nation&#x27;s outstanding public school system, complete with the first public kindergartens. Once the conservatives returned to power in 1872, however, public schooling became again a low priority matter in rural Missouri.

====Ozark traditionalism====

In highly traditional, remote parts of the Ozark Mountains there was little demand for modern medicine. Childbirth, aches, pains and broken bones were handled by local practitioners of folk medicine, most of whom were women. Their herbs, salves and other remedies often healed sick people, but their methods relied especially on recognizing and ministering to their patients&#x27; psychological, spiritual, and physical needs. Traditionalism and Hillbilly themes have become a money-making enterprise in the 21st century Ozarks, as Branson, Missouri is a major tourist attraction featuring traditional folklore.

====Women====
Before the war the police and municipal judges used their powers to regulate rather than eliminate the sex trades. In antebellum St. Louis, prostitutes working in orderly, discreet brothels were seldom arrested or harassed—unless they were unusually boisterous, engaged in sexual activities outside their established district, or violated other rules of appropriate conduct. In 1861 St. Louis passed a vagrancy ordinance, criminalizing any woman who walked on the streets after sunset. In 1871 the city passed a law forbidding women from working in bars and saloons, even if the women were owners. These laws were meant to keep prostitution at a minimum, but adversely affected women who were legitimately employed.

Middle-class women demanded entry into higher education, and the state colleges reluctantly admitted them. Culver-Stockton College opened in the 1850s as a coeducational school, the first west of the Mississippi. Women were first admitted to the normal school of Missouri State University at Columbia in 1868, but they had second-class status. They were shunted into a few narrow academic programs, restricted in their use of the library, separated from the men, and forced to wear uniforms. They were not allowed to live on campus. President Samuel Spahr Laws was the most restrictive administrator, enforcing numerous rules and the wearing of drab uniforms. Still, the number of women students at the school grew despite the difficulties. When the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy opened at Rolla in 1871, its first class had 21 male and six female students. Well into the 20th century, the women who attended the school were given an arts and music program that was little better than a high school education.

Josephine Silone Yates (1859–1912) was an African-American activist who devoted her career to combating discrimination and uplifting her race. She taught at the Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, and served as the first president of the Women&#x27;s League of Kansas City; she was later president of the National Association of Colored Women. Yates tried to prepare women for roles as wage earners in Northern cities. She also encouraged black ownership of land for those who remained in the South. Since whites judged blacks by the behavior of the lower class, she argued that advancement of the race ultimately depended on working-class adherence to a strict moral code.

===Progressive reform and politics===
The Progressive Era (1890s to 1920s) saw numerous prominent leaders from Missouri trying to end corruption and modernize politics, government and society.

====St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair of 1904====

Governor David Rowland Francis was a key main promoter of the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair of 1904, serving as President of what was formally titled Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Historians generally emphasize the prominence of themes of race and empire, and the Fair&#x27;s long-lasting impact on intellectuals in the fields of history, art history, architecture and anthropology. From the point of view of the memory of the average person who attended the fair, it primarily promoted entertainment, consumer goods and popular culture.

====Governor Joseph Folk====
Joseph Folk was a key leader who made a strong appeal to middle class and rural evangelical Protestants. Folk, a Democrat, was elected governor as a progressive reformer in the 1904 election. He promoted what he called &quot;the Missouri Idea&quot;, the concept of Missouri as a leader in public morality through popular control of law and strict enforcement. He successfully conducted antitrust prosecutions, ended free railroad passes for state officials, extended bribery statues, improved election laws, required formal registration for lobbyists, made racetrack gambling illegal, and enforced the Sunday-closing law. He helped enact Progressive legislation, including an initiative and referendum provision, regulation of elections, education, employment and child labor, railroads, food, business, and public utilities. A number of efficiency-oriented examiner boards and commissions were established during Folk&#x27;s administration, including many agricultural boards and the Missouri library commission.

During 1892–1904 the Democratic Party lost its dominance of Missouri state politics, and by the 1920s the Republican and Democratic parties were roughly evenly matched in strength. Partly this was due to corruption among Democrats in St. Louis, but also Republicans gained from presiding over the swift, decisive American victory in the Spanish–American War of 1898. In the 1904 presidential election, Missouri was carried by President Theodore Roosevelt, the first time the state had voted Republican in ten presidential elections, and was on course to become a swing state for most of the 20th century.

====Farming====
Between the Civil War and the end of World War II, Missouri transitioned from a rural economy to a hybrid industrial-service-agricultural economy as the Midwest rapidly industrialized. The expansion of railroads to the West transformed Kansas City into a major transportation hub within the nation. The growth of the Texas cattle industry along with this increased rail infrastructure and the invention of the refrigerated boxcar also made Kansas City a major meatpacking center, as large cattle drives from Texas brought herds of cattle to Dodge City and other Kansas towns. There, the cattle were loaded onto trains destined for Kansas City, where they were butchered and distributed to the eastern markets. The first half of the twentieth century was the height of Kansas City&#x27;s prominence and its downtown became a showcase for stylish Art Deco skyscrapers as construction boomed.

====Children====
The Missouri Children&#x27;s Code Commission was the product of a Progressive reform movement which involved prominent educators and social workers and a coalition of citizens&#x27; groups. The first commission began in 1915 to develop proposals to protect children from harsh working conditions and deal with delinquency, neglect, and child welfare. Its proposals were rejected by the conservative legislature. Appointed in 1917, the second commission revised the earlier proposals and actively engaged in an educational promotional campaign, gaining the support of various organizations such as the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, The Red Cross, women&#x27;s clubs, suffrage groups, and others. The Missouri Children&#x27;s Code was finally passed in 1919.

In 1919 Missouri became the 11th state to ratify the 19th amendment, which granted women the right to vote.

====Environment====
During the Progressive Era in the early twentieth century, there were three competing visions of appropriate control and use of water resources of the Missouri River; they were expressed by three organizations: the Kansas City Commercial Club (KCCC), the Missouri River Sanitary Conference (MRSC), and the Missouri Valley Public Health Association (MVPHA). The KCCC&#x27;s vision of commercial development envisioned the &quot;Economic River.&quot; MRSC&#x27;s vision of a shared water supply requiring protection through community cooperation emphasized the &quot;Healthy River.&quot; MVPHA&#x27;s vision of commercial development coupled with individual efforts to prevent pollution was a compromise blending of the first two. The &quot;Economic River&quot; represents the Progressive approach focused on professional elites and federal solutions, whereas the &quot;Healthy River&quot; represents the approach focused on community leadership and solutions, as well as an early example of holistic, locally oriented conservation.

Sarvis (2000, 2002) traces the controversy over the creation of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways (ONSR) in southeastern Missouri. Boasting clear rivers and spectacular landscape, the area saw a political contest for control of river recreational development between two federal agencies, the National Park Service (NPS) and the U.S. Forest Service. Local residents opposed NPS plans that included eminent domain acquisition of private property. Both agencies presented rival bills in Congress, and in 1964 the NPS plan was selected by Congress. In the long run the NPS has successfully accommodated and supervised OSNR recreation for two million visitors a year. By contrast, the Forest Service&#x27;s nearby recreational activities have handled no more than 16,000 visitors yearly.

===Missouri in World War I===
Most Missouri residents responded with fervent patriotism to the demands of World War I. Voluntary enlistment in the Army were high, and there was little significant draft resistance. However, German Americans had opposed entry into the war, and their ethnic strongholds were mostly cool or hostile to the war effort. They were often denounced as unpatriotic. Officials and communities throughout the state mounted their own displays of patriotism and support for the Allies, with special emphasis on mobilizing public opinion and further strengthening agricultural programs and economies that had already been bolstered by prewar market demands. While there were some traditionalistic farmers who did not believe America should be in the war, more representative was the case of Harry Truman. He operated a farm near Kansas City (1906–17) that was prosperous and strengthened him physically and emotionally for the future. Overall rural Missouri gave strong support to the war effort. In 1917 when the U.S. Food Administration, headed by Herbert Hoover, began promoting voluntary guidelines for increased farm production and reduced consumer use of items in short supply, Missouri met, and in many cases exceeded, the national standards.

==Expansion, recession, and war (1920–1945)==

===Economic growth during the 1920s===
The Hall brothers, Joyce, Rollie, and William, emerged from poverty in Nebraska in the 1900s by opening a bookstore. When the European craze for sending postcards reached America, the brothers quickly began merchandizing them and became the postcard jobber for the Great Plains. As business boomed they relocated to Kansas City in 1910 and eventually founded the Hallmark Cards gift card company, which soon came to dominate a national market. Allen Percival &quot;Percy&quot; Green operated the A. P. Green Company in Mexico, Missouri. Green bought a struggling brickworks in 1910 and found a national market by transforming it into a leading manufacturer of &quot;fire bricks,&quot; bricks designed to withstand high temperatures for use in steel plants and lining the boilers of ships. In 1913, in the town of Clinton, Royal Booth, then a high school junior, began a business breeding purebred chickens. After serving in the Army in World War I, Booth returned to his booming enterprise. The growth of his Booth Farms and Hatchery had encouraged other area entrepreneurs to enter the poultry breeding business. Booth rebuilt his operation after a 1924 fire, and concentrated on breeding hens that laid eggs all year long. By 1930, Clinton&#x27;s hatcheries had an annual capacity of over three million eggs, making Clinton the &quot;Baby Chick Capital of the World&quot; and benefiting thousands of farmers throughout the region; however, the industry declined and the hatchery closed in 1967.

Edward Leavy, head of Pierce Petroleum company, identified the potential of the Ozark region as a tourist attraction in the 1920s. Pierce Petroleum opened roadside taverns and expanded to include gas stations, hotels, restaurants, and a variety of services for automobile travelers. The Great Depression forced Pierce Petroleum to sell out to Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation, but by then many other entrepreneurs saw the opportunity for tours expansion in the Ozarks.

===Pendergast machine===
Political machines had operated for generations in St. Louis and Kansas City, but the Pendergast machine in Kansas City, formed in 1925, achieved nationwide notoriety that ended in the boss going to federal prison. Tom Pendergast (1872–1945) learned his skills from the Irish Democratic political workers in his older brother&#x27;s inner-city ward. He was never mayor, but held the more powerful post of Democratic Party chairman in Jackson County, including Kansas City and its suburbs. He artfully used the city&#x27;s new 1925 charter, in alliance with crime leader Johnny Lanzia. They recruited from criminals to transform his local Democratic Club into a criminal enterprise. In control of the city government, Pendergast picked candidates, distributed government jobs, and collected a percentage of some city revenues through a system of monopolies, tributes, kickbacks, and bribes. The federal Treasury Department stepped on orders from the Secretary, even though Pendergast was a loyal Democrat. Federal prosecutors brought hundreds of criminal indictments, convicted the leaders and destroyed the machine. Pendergast himself pleaded guilty to income tax evasion. He was sentenced to 15 months in the Leavenworth prison, and prohibited from further political involvement. His health collapsed and he died in 1945.

===The Great Depression and the New Deal===
The Great Depression affected nearly every aspect of Missouri&#x27;s economy, particularly mining, railroading, and retailing. In 1933, the Missouri Pacific railroad declared bankruptcy; retail sales declined statewide by 50 percent, and more than 300 Missouri banks failed in the early 1930s. St. Louis manufacturing declined in value from more than $600 million in 1929 to $339 million in 1935; despite industrial diversification in the city, output fell more and unemployment was greater than the rest of country by the mid-1930s. The brick and tile industry of St. Louis virtually collapsed, dramatically altering the economic conditions of neighborhoods such as The Hill. In response to rising discontent with the economy, the St. Louis police surveilled and harassed unemployed leftist workers, and in July 1932, a protest by the unemployed was violently broken up by police. The Depression also threatened Missouri cultural institutions such as the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, which nearly folded in 1933. Kansas City suffered from the Depression as well, although not as severely as St. Louis. Manufacturing fell in value from $220 million in 1929 to $122 million in 1935; charities were feeding 10 percent of the population by late 1932. Unlike St. Louis, Kansas City was able to supply work to many of its unemployed citizens via a $50 million bond issue that allowed for several large public works projects.

Rural Missouri suffered under the economic effects of both the Depression of natural forces. In 1930, a statewide drought struck the Ozarks and the Bootheel regions particularly hard, followed by equally deleterious droughts in 1934 and 1936. In addition, grasshoppers attacked Missouri cropland in 1936, destroying nearly a million acres of corn and other crops. Farm prices declined, and banks and insurance companies took ownership of foreclosed farmland in the Ozarks. Despite these hardships, the farm population of Missouri increased during the early years of the Depression, and unemployed urban workers sought subsistence farms throughout the state and particularly in the Ozarks.

Banks in the Ozarks frequently arranged rentals to tenant farmers, who in turn hired their sharecroppers for labor. The tenant-sharecropper system began before the Great Depression, but by 1938, there was increasing mechanization on farms. This shift allowed a single farmer to work more land, putting the sharecroppers out of work. Left-wing elements from the local Socialist movement, and from St. Louis, moved in to organize the sharecroppers into the Southern Tenant Farmers&#x27; Union. They had a highly visible, violent confrontation with state authorities in 1939.

By the late 1930s some of the industries of the state had recovered, although not to their pre-1929 levels. Both Anheuser-Busch and the St. Louis Car Company had resumed profitable operations, and clothing and electrical product manufacturing were expanding. By 1938, the St. Louis airport handled nearly double the passengers it had in 1932, while the Kraft Cheese Company established a milk processing plant in Springfield in 1939. Recovery seemed at hand. However, in 1939, manufacturing as a whole remained 25 percent below its 1929 level, wholesaling was 32 percent below the 1929 level, and retail sales were 22 percent lower than they were in 1929. In early 1940, the Missouri unemployment rate remained higher than 8 percent, while urban areas had a rate at higher than 10 percent. Both St. Louis and Kansas City lost ground as industrial producers in the country.

===World War II===
More than 450,000 Missouri residents served in the military during World War II, and roughly two-thirds were conscripted. More than 8,000 Missourians died serving in the conflict, the first of whom was George Whitman, killed during the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Hospitals such as O&#x27;Reilly General in Springfield, were used as military hospitals. Several Missouri soldiers became prominent during the war, such as Mildred H. McAfee, commander of the WAVES, Dorothy C. Stratton, commander of the SPARS, Walter Krueger, commander of the Sixth United States Army, Jimmy Doolittle, leader of the Doolittle Raid, and Maxwell D. Taylor, commander of the 101st Airborne Division. The most well-known of the 89 generals and admirals from Missouri was Omar Bradley, who led combat forces in Europe and led the single largest field command in U.S. history.

At home, Missouri residents organized air raid drills and participated in rationing and scrap drives. Missourians also purchased more than $3 billion in war bonds during the eight drives conducted for the war. Local groups and well-known figures supported the war effort as well. Missouri painter Thomas Hart Benton created a mural series known as &quot;The Year of Peril&quot;, and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra performed at concerts sponsored by the United Service Organizations (USO).
The economy of Missouri was dramatically affected by the war: unemployment virtually disappeared during the early years of the war, and both St. Louis and Kansas City took steps to ensure workers were involved in essential industries. Rural areas lost population as underemployed workers, especially Southern African Americans, moved to cities to find jobs. Both teenagers and women also entered the labor force in greater numbers, as many men were serving overseas. In Jackson County, Missouri, roughly half of the workers at an ordnance factory and an aircraft plant were women. As a result of the departure of soldiers and higher employment rates among adults, juvenile delinquency increased, leading many Missouri communities to establish curfews and build recreational facilities for youth.

The war brought a surge of prosperity to Missouri agriculture, and farming became a major war industry in the state. Farmers were encouraged to increase food production and to conserve other materials as much as possible, and rationing of machinery, tires, and other equipment. Despite these difficulties, many farmers modernized and learned new techniques due to the efforts of federal programs such as the Cooperative Extension Service, the Soil Conservation Service, and the Rural Electrification Administration. The Farm Security Administration provided loans and information to low-income farmers, and it also recruited and trained farm laborers in Missouri. Despite the significance of the agricultural industry, the population of Missouri working on farms declined 59 percent from 1939 to 1945, and the overall rural population declined 24 percent, a continuation of the trend toward urbanization in the state. The greatest declines in farm population were in agriculturally poor regions of the state, and in more suitable areas, remaining farm populations increased their mechanization of agriculture.

Manufacturing in Missouri also benefited from the war; both St. Louis and Kansas City were home to major war industries, particularly aviation in St. Louis. Kansas City also was a hub of aircraft manufacturing and development, although the city also produced a variety of military equipment as well. Railroading experienced a revival statewide with an increase in passenger and freight traffic; more than 300 freight trains and 200 passenger or troop trains transited Kansas City daily by the beginning of 1945.

The state also became home to a large military installation, Fort Leonard Wood, construction of which began in 1940 near the town of Waynesville. Construction of the base displaced rural families, but it ultimately brought thousands of workers and economic stimulus to the area. After its construction, Fort Leonard Wood operated as a training facility for combat engineers and as a base of operations for several infantry and artillery units.

===Race and society (1920–1945)===
Chester A. Franklin (1880–1955) was one of the leading black spokesmen in the state. He founded the leading black newspaper, &quot;The Kansas City Call&quot; in 1919, building a regional circulation, and good advertising support from the business community. Franklin was a deeply committed conservative Republican, who slashed away every week at the corrupt Pendergast machine. However he was on good terms with one of Pendergast&#x27;s top associates, Harry Truman. Franklin admired Truman&#x27;s honesty and integrity—indeed, that was the reason Pendergast promoted him, since he needed to appease the good government forces. Truman was a rare Democrat who gave significant support for the black community, so Franklin recommend voting for him in the 1934 in 1940 Senate elections. The two broke politically in 1941 over domestic issues; Franklin refused to join most black leaders in switching to the Democratic Party. However Franklin&#x27;s cordial dealings with Truman over the years encouraged Truman to announce his unexpectedly strong support for civil rights in 1948.

The Great Depression undermined the economic and social opportunities of Missouri blacks. Unskilled jobs disappeared; some black workers were replaced by whites. White housewives could no longer afford black domestic service workers. By 1933, 60 percent of the black workers in St. Louis were unemployed, and wage cuts further hurt the economic position of blacks. Black businesses were weakened by the Depression, while black churches could only provide limited assistance to the needy. The black press and the National Urban League continued to pressure local governments for equal treatment and an end to discrimination. The Communist Party made a major effort to enroll black activists, with minimal success. The New Deal operated numerous large-scale welfare programs for all impoverished Americans, including blacks. The big-city machines flourished as never before, as they directed unemployed families to The numerous alphabetical welfare programs, such as the CWA, FERA, CCC and WPA. New Deal farm programs Restored prosperity to agriculture. Many black politicians switched their allegiances to the Democratic party and in Missouri (unlike the South) The blacks could vote and made a major difference at the polls.

The economy rebounded sharply during the rearmament of 1940–41, and grew very rapidly during the war years. Jobs were plentiful in most urban areas, and farmers flocked to the cities.

During World War II racial tension increased in both rural and urban Missouri; in early 1942 in Sikeston, a white mob lynched Cleo Wright in public. The United States Department of Justice investigated the lynching, the first time since Reconstruction that the federal government had tried to prosecute such a case. Despite the investigation, the government did not file indictments, as witnesses refused to cooperate. In summer 1943 in Kansas City, a race riot nearly broke out after a white city police officer killed a black man.

==Moderate growth and change: 1946–present==

===Politics after the war===

After the war Republicans gained strength in the state, although Missourians voted for Democratic politicians on a state and national level with relative frequency. On a national level, Missouri voted with the winner of the presidential election for most of the 20th century except for 1956; this gained the state its status as the Missouri bellwether. Despite its swing state status nationally, Democrats controlled both houses of the legislature after World War II, and only one Republican governor served the state from 1945 until the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s.

In 1948 the first statewide elections after the adoption of the 1945 Missouri Constitution were held; Forrest Smith, former state auditor, won the Democratic primary and the governor&#x27;s office with the support of labor unions and city political machines. Both the sheriff of St. Louis, Thomas Callanan, and the organized crime boss Charles Binaggio of Kansas City were ardent Smith supporters in the elections. Despite support from organized crime, Smith&#x27;s administration was relatively honest and efficient, and he made significant contributions to the growth of the Missouri transportation system. Under Smith, the state gasoline tax was increased, and the state embarked on a ten-year highway building program in 1952 to provide state highway access to within two miles of 95% of the state population. Smith retired at the end of his term, allowing Phil Donnelly to campaign for and win a second term as governor in 1952. Although Donnelly had supported an anti-strike law during his first term (and alienated organized labor), he won the state with relative ease in 1952.

During his second term Donnelly alienated the other base of Democratic politics, the teachers and schools of Missouri, when he vetoed an appropriations bill for the schools as illegal. However, despite his independent streak, he left a lasting impact on a variety of areas of life in Missouri. Under Donnelly, the state reorganized its government and created a state parks division in the Missouri Department of Natural Resources; the state also adopted a 2 cents per pack tax on cigarettes in 1955 with money earmarked for schools, and in 1956, the state passed a $75 million bond issue to build new facilities at state universities and prisons.

On a national level the state population grew more slowly during the 1940s; as a consequence, after the 1950 United States census, the state lost two seats in the House of Representatives. Democratic candidate Thomas C. Hennings defeated incumbent Republican Forrest C. Donnell for the U.S. Senate in 1950, and in 1952, Republican Senator James P. Kem was defeated by Democrat Stuart Symington, beginning more than twenty years of fully Democratic representation from Missouri in the U.S. Senate.

In 1956, as with his gubernatorial predecessor Forrest Smith, Donnelly retired at the end of his term; fellow Democrat James T. Blair Jr., the son of a Missouri Supreme Court justice, won election easily. Blair, a former mayor of Jefferson City and decorated World War II veteran, initially refused to move into the Missouri Governor&#x27;s Mansion until several improvements were made to it. The state budgets under Blair expanded dramatically, and Blair led an expansion of the state mental health programs. Blair also led a more substantial reorganization of state government in 1959, and in 1960, when Senator Hennings died in office, Blair named Lieutenant Governor Edward V. Long as his replacement. Blair retired from politics in 1961 after serving one term.

For the 1960 elections Missourians supported Kennedy by more than 10,000 votes over Nixon; Senator Long was elected in his own right, and Democratic nominee John M. Dalton, the state attorney general since 1953, took the governor&#x27;s office. At the outset of his term, Dalton oversaw redistricting of Missouri&#x27;s congressional seats, as the state again had lagged behind in population growth and lost one seat in the House. Dalton&#x27;s term as governor was marked by tax increases to pay for increased state services: liquor taxes were increased by 50 percent, cigarette taxes from 2 to 4 cents per pack, and gasoline taxes from 3 to 5 cents per gallon; the state also established the withholding system for income tax collection, at the time a controversial measure. Also under Dalton&#x27;s tenure, the state legislature established a point system for drivers&#x27; licenses and a commission to hear cases of employment discrimination in the state. In 1964, Dalton supported Lieutenant Governor Hilary A. Bush in Bush&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor. Bush lost the 1964 primary to Warren E. Hearnes, who was supported by the St. Louis party organization and who ultimately won the governor&#x27;s office that year.

Hearnes overwhelmingly defeated Ethan Shepley, the Republican candidate, in his race for governor. Democrats also won every statewide office, both houses of the state legislature, and heavily supported Lyndon Johnson over Barry Goldwater for president. The Democratic government passed several progressive measures in 1965, including a law banning racial discrimination in public accommodations, the creation of state hospitals for intellectual disability, and the creation of Missouri Southern College and Missouri Western College. In addition, the legislature passed a Missouri Constitutional amendment, ratified by the voters, that permitted governors to run for a second consecutive term. The Democrats retained control of the state legislature in 1966, but Republicans made small and surprising gains in the state in the 1968 national and state elections.

Republican John Danforth won the office of attorney general in 1968, while the state&#x27;s voters selected Republican Richard Nixon for president by a margin of 20,000 votes. Governor Hearnes, a Democrat, was reelected to the office and became the first governor to serve a consecutive four-year term since John Miller in 1828. Although Hearnes&#x27;s agenda ran into opposition in the legislature, he successfully argued for the passage of increased welfare laws in the state. In 1970, Republicans gained further seats in the state legislature, and John Danforth nearly won election to the U.S. Senate against Stuart Symington. Christopher Bond, another Republican, won election as state auditor against Haskell Holman by more than 200,000 votes.
Two years after their gains in the legislature, Republicans continued their ascendance in Missouri politics: Christopher Bond, the Republican state auditor, became the youngest person elected governor in state history in 1972. Republicans would control the governor&#x27;s mansion for sixteen of the next twenty years, and they implemented significant structural reforms in that period. In the same election, Missouri voters approved a comprehensive reorganization of the executive branch of the state, bringing the state&#x27;s employees under the control of directors who report to the governor. The legislature under Bond took conservative measures, including eliminating property taxes on household goods and instituting mandatory sentencing for gun crimes. Despite Democrats retaining control of both houses of the legislature, the General Assembly did not pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

In 1976 Bond was defeated for reelection by Democratic challenger Joseph P. Teasdale, a Kansas City prosecutor. Bond&#x27;s defeat, which came by only 13,000 votes, was attributed to late campaign negative television advertising by Teasdale and to southwestern Republicans withholding votes from Bond. Despite his loss, the Republican Party gained even more strength in 1976: John Danforth won the vacant U.S. Senate formerly occupied by Symington, William Phelps won reelection as lieutenant governor, and John Ashcroft won election as state attorney general. While in office, Teasdale was marred by political controversies, and his relationship with the Republican lieutenant governor was particularly poor. Among the legislature passed during the late 1970s was an updated criminal code and a new death penalty law, an elimination of the state sales tax on prescription drugs and on inheritances, and a campaign contribution disclosure law. The General Assembly also refused to consider Teasdale&#x27;s request to increase corporate tax rates, and the Equal Rights Amendment was again defeated annually. Progressives and labor unions, however, mounted a successful effort to defeat a right-to-work law.

In 1980 former governor Christopher Bond regained the office against Teasdale, who retired from politics and returned to law practice. The 1980 elections in Missouri reflected the national rejection of incumbency: in addition to Teasdale&#x27;s defeat, Missouri voters elected Ronald Reagan over Jimmy Carter for president and Williams Phelps lost reelection for lieutenant governor. Republicans also gained in Missouri&#x27;s Congressional delegation, winning four of the ten seats in the House; Democratic Senator Thomas Eagleton, however, was reelected by Missourians. Bond&#x27;s second term was marked by a more conciliatory tone toward the legislature, and he focused on dramatically reducing state spending in a time of inflation and recession. At the end of his term, he nominated Margaret Kelly to replace James Antonio as state auditor, in so doing making her the first woman to hold statewide office; Kelly would win election to the office in 1986 and serve until 1999. Bond retired from politics, albeit temporarily, at the end of his second term in office.

Statewide elections in 1984 gave four of the five elected offices to Republicans, and, like most states, Missouri voted for Reagan in the presidential election. The only office held by Democrats was won by Harriett Woods, who became lieutenant governor and the first woman elected to statewide office. John Ashcroft, who had been elected attorney general in 1976, won the governor&#x27;s race. Ashcroft became known as a relatively prudish figure, refusing to serve alcohol at state receptions, and he took positions contradictory to his previous stances. Ashcroft played a role in supporting large increases to the state education system during the late 1980s, a position helped by a better financial situation for the state. When he ran for reelection in 1988, Ashcroft&#x27;s wide popularity allowed him to defeat Betty Hearnes by a 64 to 34 percent margin, a wider spread than that achieved by George H. W. Bush, who Missourians selected for president that year.

During his second term Ashcroft proposed several reforms to state government, some of which were not enacted. Two of his failed proposals included a reduction in the size of the General Assembly and a lengthening of the school year; successful changes included a welfare reform bill that required workforce training for recipients. He also supported a failed tax increase to supply higher funding to higher education. Ashcroft made a mark promoting social issues, particularly with his stance against abortion; he appeared on national television to defend a restrictive Missouri abortion law passed under his administration. He also supported treating juvenile offenders as adults, and he nominated judges to the Missouri Supreme Court who supported his views. By the end of his second term, state spending had risen to more than $10 billion, although he maintained that he supported greater fiscal discipline; when he left office in 1992, he began building campaign funds and, in 1994, ran for the seat held by Senator Danforth, who was retiring. Ashcroft won election by more than 400,000 votes against Democrat Alan Wheat, a liberal African-American House representative from Kansas City.
In 1992 Mel Carnahan won the gubernatorial election as a Democrat after a primary fight with St. Louis Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl. Carnahan defeated then-state Attorney General William L. Webster in the general election. Carnahan won reelection in 1996 against State Auditor Margaret B. Kelly. Near the end of his second term, Carnahan announced his intention to challenge Ashcroft for the U.S. Senate seat that Ashcroft had won in 1994; during an intense campaign, Carnahan traveled frequently throughout the state. On October 16, 2000, the plane in which he was traveling crashed near Goldman, Missouri, killing the governor, his son (the pilot), and Chris Sifford, a campaign advisor. At his death, Lieutenant Governor Roger B. Wilson assumed the governorship; Mel Carnahan&#x27;s widow, Jean Carnahan, became the unofficial Democratic Party replacement against Ashcroft. Despite being deceased, Mel Carnahan ultimately defeated Ashcroft in the November election, and Jean Carnahan was appointed to the seat, becoming the first woman to serve Missouri in the U.S. Senate. Roger Wilson, who did not run for governor in 2000, was replaced by Bob Holden, a Democrat who defeated Jim Talent of Chesterfield in the general election.

===Social change and education===
Missouri generally made slow progress toward equal rights for African Americans during the postwar period. Due to World War II, Missouri&#x27;s black population had increased and concentrated in the two urban areas of St. Louis and Kansas City. In 1950 in Jackson County (including Kansas City), the black population was 57,000, representing 10.5 percent of the total; in St. Louis County and St. Louis City, the combined black population stood at 171,000, making up 13.6 percent of the total. 154,500 blacks lived in the city of St. Louis alone, representing 18 percent of the city. The black population that did not live in the urban areas lived in the Bootheel or along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. In the rural areas, blacks lived in extreme poverty; in the case of Cropperville, a remnant community of former sharecroppers, average wages were $50 a year, and many residents lived in tents.

After the war black workers were paid less than white workers and tended to be employed in menial positions. In 1950, of the 109,000 black workers in the state, more than 100,000 were employed in service, menial labor, or unskilled industry. Blacks often could not obtain white collar jobs or promotions, and they were frequently fired first in layoffs. In 1950, wages for St. Louis blacks were 58 percent of average wages for whites, while unemployment for blacks in St. Louis was 15 percent in 1954, 2.5 times higher than rates for whites.
Several black Missourians made some progress in social status during the postwar period. The National Park Service dedicated the birthplace of George Washington Carver as a national monument in 1943, making it the first national monument dedicated in honor of a black person. In 1945, Oscar Ficklin, a St. Louis chemist, became the first black named foreman of a jury. Also in 1945, St. Louis elected J.C. Castron, the first black man on the Board of Aldermen. The next year, the city elected William A. Massingale to the General Assembly, and in 1948, Kansas City elected J. McKinley Neal, the second black person from that area to the legislature. President Dwight Eisenhower named St. Louisan J. Ernest Wilkins, Sr. to be U.S. Assistant Secretary of Labor in 1954. Black scholars working in Missouri also began to achieve greater fame during the 1940s and 1950s, including Lorenzo Greene and Oliver Cox.

The employment discrimination of the postwar period continued well into the 1950s and 1960s.
Housing discrimination also affected the black population of Missouri after the war. Blacks found it difficult to obtain loans for housing, and real estate agents colluded to prevent blacks from purchasing homes in predominantly white neighborhoods. In St. Louis, a landmark civil rights case related to housing discrimination emerged from a lawsuit filed in the late 1940s. In August 1945, the black Shelley family bought a house at 4600 Labadie in St. Louis, despite a restrictive covenant prohibiting its purchase by blacks. A neighbor family filed suit to prevent the sale; an initial court ruling refused to evict the Shelleys, followed by a Missouri Supreme Court ruling that called for the enforcement of the covenant. Finally, in May 1948, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; that restrictive covenants violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Despite this landmark ruling, Missouri continued to encourage restrictive covenants because of a state court ruling that allowed lawsuits for damages due to violation of the covenants (this practice continued until 1953). Even after the end of lawsuits for damages, informal discrimination in housing continued well into the 1950s because of a practice among realtor groups of expelling members who sold homes to blacks in white neighborhoods. It would not be until the 1970s that Missouri passed a fair housing law that prohibited many of the discriminatory practices.

Blacks also experienced widespread discrimination in public accommodations during the 1940s and 1950s in Missouri. In some cases, separate facilities were provided for blacks, while in others, blacks were not permitted to use any facilities. In 1947, Lincoln University rented the high school stadium of the Jefferson City Public Schools; when Jefferson City informed the university that its black students would not be permitted to use the showers or lockers for its homecoming game, the university was forced to forfeit its rental fee. In 1950 and 1953, the public pools of St. Louis and Kansas City were desegregated due to court order. Only in 1965, due to the threat of federal intervention, the General Assembly passed the Missouri Public Accommodation Act to prohibit discrimination in public places.

====School integration====
In the early 1950s legal challenges led to the admission of black students to the University of Missouri, which had heretofore been a white-only institution. From 1950 to 1954, no less than four attempts were made by black families to enroll their students in white schools in Kansas City, St. Louis County, and St. Louis City. In one case in St. Louis city, a black college student attempted to enroll at the whites-only Harris Teachers College (then owned by the St. Louis Public Schools); courts rejected the student&#x27;s lawsuit on the grounds that the faculties, libraries, and laboratories of the Stowe Teachers College were substantially equal to those at Harris. In another St. Louis case, the schools canceled a class rather than permit a black student to enroll, after a court ordered the district to allow black students to enroll in white schools when their own schools did not offer certain classes. In Kansas City, 150 black students attempted to enroll at a white school; despite their schools not offering gymnasiums or auditoriums, their attempt was rejected. Finally, in 1954, a black student attempted to enroll in Kirkwood School District (in suburban St. Louis); the decision was stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals in light of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s expected ruling in five desegregation cases collectively known as &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

After the ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; Missouri Attorney General John M. Dalton issued a recommendation that Missouri&#x27;s school segregation laws were void. Despite this, several Missouri districts refused to comply with the ruling; schools in Charleston avoided integration until the mid-1960s, along with several other Bootheel districts. In many cases, black students were assigned to schools more than 30 miles from their homes, beyond white schools, and many libraries and parks remained off limits to black students. In addition, many black teachers were laid off after integration. In Moberly, eleven black teachers were laid off in 1955, and more than 125 teachers lost their jobs in mid-Missouri. Desegregation in St. Louis and Kansas City took place in 1955, but it nonetheless was a slow process.

During the 1980s and 1990s inner suburbs of Kansas City and St. Louis began to lose population, while outer suburban areas increased dramatically in size. Wealthy suburban cities such as Mission Hills of Kansas City and Ladue and Creve Coeur of St. Louis continued to exert influence beyond their size during the late 20th century. Many suburban communities began to accumulate traits of traditional, comprehensive cities by luring business and annexing area. Although the two cities of St. Louis and Kansas City continued to be the urban anchors of the state, five of the six other largest cities grew in population from 1960 to 2000.

===Agricultural and economic life===
From the end of World War II through the 1990s, Missouri agriculture underwent significant changes. In 1945, Missouri had more than 240,000 farms; by 1997, the number of farms decreased by 59 percent to less than 99,000. A variety of technological innovations and advances caused the decline, which allowed fewer Missouri farmers to produce an equivalent amount of food. In tandem, rural Missouri counties lost population, and during the period of 1954 to 1997, the average size of Missouri farms increased from 170 to nearly 300 acres. Despite these structural changes, crop yields were stable during the period, and the state continued to have a relatively diverse agricultural base.

Another area of economic change during the late 20th century was the decline of lumbering and milling. During the 1920s, as a result of overcutting, the Long-Bell Lumber Company moved most of its Missouri operations to other states, and much of Missouri&#x27;s woodlands were depleted by the 1950s. By the late 20th century, shortleaf pine forests had been largely replaced by smaller woods of hardwood trees. Despite its decline from importance, in 2001, lumbering was a $3 billion industry.

During the 1960s lead mining again became a significant industry in Missouri as a result of the 1948 discovery of the Viburnum Trend in the New Lead Belt region of the Southeast Missouri Lead District. The Old Lead Belt (also part of the Southeast Missouri Lead District) suffered a slow decline, however, and the last of the mines in that region closed by 1972. Both iron and coal mining also expanded during the late 1960s; however, employment in mining declined overall during the late 20th century.

Among the fastest growing segments of the economy was the accommodation and food services industry, but it was paired with a steep decline in manufacturing. Among the greatest declines was that of stockyards and meatpacking; in 1944, Kansas City was the second-largest meatpacking city in the United States, but by the 1990s, the city had neither packing plants nor stockyards. In addition, garment manufacturing, which had previously employed thousands of workers in Kansas City prior to the 1950s, fell out of existence by the late 1990s. Statewide, another industry that declined dramatically was shoemaking, which employed fewer than 3,000 Missourians in 2001.

Despite its decline, manufacturing continued to play a role in the state&#x27;s economy. Kansas City maintained a manufacturing base in its eastern Leeds industrial district, including automotive plants and an atomic weapon components plant. St. Louis maintained an industrial base with Anheuser-Busch, Monsanto, Ralston Purina, and several automotive plants. In the other four urban areas of the state (Springfield, St. Joseph, Joplin, and Columbia), the largest economic sector was manufacturing, with a combined output of more than $10 billion.

A relatively new sector of the Missouri economy developed in 1994 with the legalization of riverboat gambling in the state. The United States Army Corps of Engineers denied riverboat gambling cruises, which in practice led to permanently moored barges with extensive superstructures. Missouri gambling also included a lottery, which had been in place for several years prior to the legalization of casino gaming.

<doc id="176841" wikidata="Q1247929" url="?curid=176841" title="Existentialism Is a Humanism">
<text>Existentialism Is a Humanism () is a 1946 work by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, based on a lecture by the same name he gave at Club Maintenant in Paris, on 29 October 1945. In early translations, Existentialism and Humanism was the title used in the United Kingdom; the work was originally published in the United States as Existentialism, and a later translation employs the original title.

==Summary==

Sartre asserts that the key defining concept of existentialism is that the existence of a person is prior to their essence or &quot;existence precedes essence&quot;.

Thus, Sartre rejects what he calls &quot;deterministic excuses&quot; and claims that people must take responsibility for their behavior. Sartre defines anguish as the emotion that people feel once they realize that they are responsible not just for themselves, but for all humanity. Anguish leads people to realize that their actions guide humanity and allows them to make judgments about others based on their attitude towards freedom. Nevertheless, &quot;It is not the will that gives value to the possibility. Valuation depends on me, that’s true, but not on my will. It depends on my project, that is to say, on how I perceive the world, how I experience it.&quot; Anguish is also associated with Sartre&#x27;s notion of , which he defines as optimistic reliance on a set of possibilities that make action possible. Sartre claims that &quot;In fashioning myself, I fashion Man.&quot;, saying that the individual&#x27;s action will affect and shape mankind. The being-for-itself uses despair to embrace freedom and take meaningful action in full acceptance of whatever consequences may arise as a result. He also describes abandonment as the loneliness that atheists feel when they realize that there is no God to prescribe a way of life, no guidance for people on how to live; that we&#x27;re abandoned in the sense of being alone in the universe and the arbiters of our own essence. &quot;There is a contingency of human existence. It is a condemnation of their being. Their being is not determined, so it is up to everyone to create their own existence, for which they are then responsible. They cannot not be free, there is a form of necessity for freedom, which can never be given up.&quot; Sartre closes his work by emphasizing that existentialism, as it is a philosophy of action and one&#x27;s defining oneself, is optimistic and liberating. &quot;Sartre offers a description of human beings as a project and as a commitment.&quot;

==Publication history==
First published in French in 1946, &quot;Existentialism and Humanism&quot; was published in an English translation by Philip Mairet in 1948. In the United States, the work was originally published as &quot;Existentialism&quot;. The work has also been published in German translation. An English translation by Carol Macomber, with an introduction by the sociologist Annie Cohen-Solal and notes and preface by Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre, was published under the title &quot;Existentialism Is a Humanism&quot; in 2007. by Mahammed Sherriff was later released in 2024, with a copy of the translation made freely accessible on Internet Archive, under the title &quot;Falsafadda Jiraalnimadu waa Insaannimo&quot;, making Sartre’s existentialist philosophy accessible to Somali-speaking readers.

==Reception==
&quot;Existentialism Is a Humanism&quot; has been &quot;a popular starting-point in discussions of existentialist thought,&quot; and in the philosopher Thomas Baldwin&#x27;s words, &quot;Seized the imagination of a generation.&quot; However, Sartre himself later rejected some of the views he expressed in the work, and regretted its publication. Other philosophers have critiqued the lecture on various grounds: Martin Heidegger wrote in a letter to the philosopher and Germanist Jean Beaufret that while Sartre&#x27;s statement that &quot;existence precedes essence&quot; reverses the metaphysical statement that essence precedes existence, &quot;The reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement.&quot; In Heidegger&#x27;s view, Sartre &quot;Stays with metaphysics in oblivion of the truth of Being.&quot;. Heidegger reportedly told Hubert Dreyfus that Sartre&#x27;s work was &quot;dreck.&quot; Marjorie Grene found Sartre&#x27;s discussion of &quot;the problem of the relation between individuals&quot; in &quot;Existentialism and Humanism&quot; to be weaker than the one he had previously offered in &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (1943). Walter Kaufmann commented that the lecture &quot;has been widely mistaken for the definitive statement of existentialism,&quot; but is rather &quot;a brilliant lecture which bears the stamp of the moment.&quot; According to Kaufmann, Sartre makes factual errors, including misidentifying philosopher Karl Jaspers as a Catholic, and presenting a definition of existentialism that is open to question. Thomas C. Anderson criticized Sartre for asserting without explanation that if a person seeks freedom from false, external authorities, then he or she must invariably allow this freedom for others. Iris Murdoch found one of Sartre&#x27;s discussions with a Marxist interesting, but otherwise considered &quot;Existentialism and Humanism&quot; to be &quot;a rather bad little book.&quot; Mary Warnock believed Sartre was right to dismiss the work. Gilles Deleuze and Michel Tournier were in attendance and also found the lecture disappointing.

The philosopher Frederick Copleston stated that Sartre, like Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Edmund Husserl, interpreted the views of René Descartes as an anticipation of his own philosophical views. The neurobiologist Steven Rose described a statement in which Sartre maintained that man &quot;will be what he makes of himself&quot; as a &quot;windily rhetorical paean to the dignity of universalistic man&quot; and &quot;more an exercise in political sloganeering than a sustainable philosophical position.&quot; He pointed to aging and disease as examples of factors that limit human freedom. The philosopher Slavoj Žižek argued that there is a parallel between Sartre&#x27;s views and claims made by the character Father Zosima in Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1880): whereas Sartre believes that with total freedom comes total responsibility, for Father Zosima &quot;each of us must make us responsible for all men&#x27;s sins&quot;.

<text>Marcel Marceau (; born Marcel Mangel; 22 March 1923 – 22 September 2007) was a French mime artist and actor most famous for his stage persona, &quot;Bip the Clown&quot;. He referred to mime as the &quot;art of silence&quot;, performing professionally worldwide for more than 60 years. 

As a Jewish youth, he lived in hiding and worked with the French Resistance during most of World War II, giving his first major performance to 3,000 troops after the liberation of Paris in August 1944 . Following the war, he studied dramatic art and mime in Paris.

==Early life==
Marcel Marceau was born in Strasbourg, France, to a Jewish family. His father, Charles Mangel, was a kosher butcher originally from Będzin, Poland. His mother, Anne Werzberg, came from Yabluniv, present-day Ukraine. Through his mother&#x27;s family, he was a cousin of Israeli singer Yardena Arazi. When Marcel was four years old, the family moved to Lille, but they later returned to Strasbourg.

After France&#x27;s invasion by Nazi Germany, Marcel, then 17, fled with his family to Limoges. His cousin Georges Loinger, one of the members of the French Jewish Resistance in France (&quot;Organisation Juive de Combat-OJC&quot;, aka Armée Juive), urged him to join in order to help rescue Jews during the Holocaust. The OJC, which was composed of nine clandestine Jewish networks, rescued thousands of Jewish children and adults during the war in France. 

He was schooled in the Paris suburbs at the home of Yvonne Hagnauer, while pretending to be a worker at the school she directed; Hagnauer would later receive the honor of Righteous Among the Nations from Yad Vashem. In 1944 Marcel&#x27;s father was captured by the Gestapo and deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was killed. Marcel&#x27;s mother survived.

Marcel and his older brother, Alain, adopted the last name &quot;Marceau&quot; during the German occupation of France; the name was chosen as a reference to François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers, a general of the French Revolution. The two brothers joined the French Resistance in Limoges. They rescued numerous children from the race laws and concentration camps in the framework of the Jewish Resistance in France, and, after the liberation of Paris, joined the French army. Owing to Marceau&#x27;s fluency in English, French, and German, he worked as a liaison officer with General George Patton&#x27;s Third Army.

According to Marceau, when he was five years of age, his mother took him to see a Charlie Chaplin film, which entranced him and led him to want to become a mime artist. The first time he used mime was after France was invaded, in order to keep Jewish children quiet while he helped them escape to neutral Switzerland.

After the war ended in 1945, he enrolled as a student in Charles Dullin&#x27;s School of Dramatic Art in the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in Paris, where he studied with teachers such as Joshua Smith and Étienne Decroux and Jean-Louis Barrault.

== Career ==
Marceau joined Jean-Louis Barrault&#x27;s company and was soon cast in the role of Arlequin in a pantomime, &quot;Baptiste&quot; (which Barrault had interpreted in the film &quot;Les Enfants du Paradis&quot;). Marceau&#x27;s performance won him such acclaim that he was encouraged to present his first &quot;mimodrama&quot;, &quot;Praxitele and the Golden Fish&quot;, at the Bernhardt Theatre that same year. The acclaim was unanimous, and Marceau&#x27;s career as a mime artist was firmly established.
In 1947 Marceau created Bip the Clown, whom he first played at the Théâtre de Poche (Pocket Theatre) in Paris. In his appearance, he wore a striped pullover and a battered, be-flowered silk opera hat. The outfit signified life&#x27;s fragility, and Bip became his alter ego, just as the &quot;Little Tramp&quot; had become Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s. Bip&#x27;s misadventures with everything from butterflies to lions, from ships and trains to dancehalls and restaurants, were limitless. As a stylist of pantomime, Marceau was acknowledged without peer. Marceau, during a televised talk with Todd Farley, expresses his respect for the mime techniques that Charlie Chaplin used in his films, noting that Chaplin seemed to be the only silent film actor who used mime.

His silent mimed exercises, which included &quot;The Cage&quot;, &quot;Walking Against the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Mask Maker&quot;, and &quot;In The Park&quot;, all became classic displays. Satires on everything from sculptors to matadors were described as works of genius. Of his summation of the ages of man in the famous &quot;Youth, Maturity, Old Age and Death&quot;, one critic said: &quot;He accomplishes in less than two minutes what most novelists cannot do in volumes.&quot; During an interview with CBS in 1987, Marceau tried to explain some of his inner feelings while creating mime, calling it the &quot;art of silence:&quot;
In 1949, following his receipt of the Deburau Prize (established as a memorial to the 19th-century mime master Jean-Gaspard Deburau) for his second mimodrama, &quot;Death before Dawn&quot;, Marceau founded Compagnie de Mime Marcel Marceau, the only company of pantomime in the world at the time. The ensemble played the leading Paris theatres, such as Le Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Le Théâtre de la Renaissance, and the Bernhardt Theatre, as well as other playhouses throughout the world.

From 1959 to 1960, a retrospective of his mimodramas, including &quot;The Overcoat&quot; by Gogol, ran for a full year at the Amibigu Théâtre in Paris. He produced 15 other mimodramas, including &quot;Pierrot de Montmartre&quot;, &quot;The Three Wigs&quot;, &quot;The Pawn Shop&quot;, &quot;14 July&quot;, &quot;The Wolf of Tsu Ku Mi&quot;, &quot;Paris Cries — Paris Laughs&quot; and &quot;Don Juan&quot; (adapted from the Spanish writer Tirso de Molina).

=== World recognition ===
Marceau performed all over the world to spread the &quot;art of silence&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;art du silence&quot;). It was the intellectual minority who knew of him until he first toured the United States in 1955 and 1956, close on the heels of his North American debut at the Stratford Festival of Canada. After his opening engagement at the Phoenix Theater in New York, which received rave reviews, he moved to the larger Barrymore Theater to accommodate the public demand. This first U.S. tour ended with a record-breaking return to standing-room-only crowds in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other major cities. His extensive transcontinental tours included South America, Africa, Australia, China, Japan, South East Asia, Taiwan, Russia, and Europe. His last world tour covered the United States in 2004, and he returned to Europe in 2005 and to Australia in 2006. He was one of the world&#x27;s most renowned mime artists.

Marceau&#x27;s art became familiar to millions through his many television appearances. His first television performance as a star performer on the Max Liebman, Mike Douglas and Dinah Shore, and he also had his one-man show entitled &quot;Meet Marcel Marceau&quot;. He teamed with Red Skelton in three concerts of pantomimes.

Marceau also showed his versatility in motion pictures such as Professor Ping in &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968); &quot;First Class&quot; (1970), in which he played 17 roles; &quot;Shanks&quot; (1974), where he combined his silent art, playing a deaf and mute puppeteer, and his speaking talent, as a mad scientist; and a cameo as himself in Mel Brooks&#x27;
&quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976), in which, with intentional irony, his character has the only audible speaking part, uttering the single word &quot;Non!&quot; when Brooks asks him (via intertitle) if he would participate in the film. His last film appearances included small roles in Klaus Kinski&#x27;s &quot;Paganini&quot; (1989) and &quot;Joseph&#x27;s Gift&quot; (1998). He also had a role in a low-budget film roughly based on his life story called &quot;Paint It White&quot;. The film was never completed because another actor in the movie, a lifelong friend with whom he had attended school, died halfway through filming.
As an author, Marceau published two books for children, the &quot;Marcel Marceau Alphabet Book&quot; and the &quot;Marcel Marceau Counting Book&quot;, and poetry and illustrations, including &quot;La ballade de Paris et du Monde&quot; (&quot;The Ballad of Paris and the World&quot;), an art book which he wrote in 1966, and &quot;The Story of Bip&quot;, written and illustrated by Marceau and published by Harper and Row. In 1974, he posed for artist Kenneth Hari and worked on paintings and drawings that resulted in a book and artwork in many museum collections. In 1982, &quot;Le Troisième Œil&quot;, (&quot;The Third Eye&quot;), his collection of ten original lithographs, was published in Paris with an accompanying text by Marceau. Belfond of Paris published &quot;Pimporello&quot; in 1987. In 2001, a new photo book for children titled &quot;Bip in a Book&quot;, published by Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, appeared in bookstores in the U.S., France, and Australia.

In 1969, Marcel Marceau opened his first school, École Internationale de Mime, in the Théàtre de la Musique in Paris. The school was open for two years with fencing, acrobatics, ballet, and five teachers of mime. In 1978, Marceau established his school, École Internationale de Mimodrame de Paris, Marcel Marceau (International School of Mimodrame of Paris, Marcel Marceau). In 1996, he established the Marceau Foundation to promote mime in the United States.

In 1995, pop megastar Michael Jackson, who had been friends with Marceau for nearly 20 years, planned a concert together with him for HBO, but the concert was canceled after Jackson was hospitalized for exhaustion during rehearsals. Jackson, during an interview, said that he had always been &quot;in awe&quot; at Marceau&#x27;s skill as a performer:
In 2000, Marceau brought his full mime company to New York City to present his new melodrama, &quot;The Bowler Hat&quot;, previously seen in Paris, London, Tokyo, Taipei, Caracas, Santo Domingo, Valencia (Venezuela), and Munich. From 1999, when Marceau returned with his classic solo show to New York and San Francisco after 15-year absences for critically acclaimed sold-out runs, his career in America enjoyed a remarkable renaissance with strong appeal to a third generation. He later appeared to overwhelming acclaim for extended engagements at such legendary American theaters as The Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C., the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles demonstrating the timeless appeal of the work and the mastery of this unique artist. 

Marceau&#x27;s new total company production &quot;Les Contes Fantastiques&quot; (&quot;Fantasy Tales&quot;) opened to great acclaim at the Théâtre Antoine in Paris.

== Personal life ==
Marceau was married three times: first to Huguette Mallet, with whom he had two sons, Michel and Baptiste; then, to Ella Jaroszewicz, with whom he had no children. His third wife was Anne Sicco, with whom he had two daughters, Camille and Aurélia.

Artist and fellow mime Paulette Frankl released a memoir in August 2014 about her decades-long relationship with Marceau, &quot;Marcel &amp; Me: A Memoir of Love, Lust, and Illusion.&quot;

== Death ==

Marceau died in a retirement home in Cahors, France, on 22 September 2007 at the age of 84. At his burial ceremony, the second movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 21 (which Marceau long used as an accompaniment for an elegant mime routine) was played, as was the sarabande of Bach&#x27;s Cello Suite No. 5. Marceau was interred at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

== Recording ==
In the recorded conversation &quot;Marcel Marceau Speaks&quot;, recorded in English with the writer William Fifield, Marcel Marceau traced the history of mime and discussed his own role in its renewed popularity. Calling mime the art of &quot;making the invisible visible,&quot; he shared how he developed his signature character, Bip.

== Awards and honors ==
Marceau was made a commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and in 1978 he received the Médaille Vermeil de la Ville de Paris. The City of Paris awarded him a grant which enabled him to reopen his International School which offered a three-year curriculum. In November 1998, President Jacques Chirac made Marceau a grand officer of the Ordre national du Mérite.

Marceau was an elected member of the Academy of Fine Arts Berlin, the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, the Académie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France.

Marceau held honorary doctorates from Ohio State University, Linfield College, Princeton University and the University of Michigan. In April 2001, Marceau was awarded the Wallenberg Medal by the University of Michigan in recognition of his humanitarianism and acts of courage aiding Jewish people and other refugees during World War II.

In 1999 New York City declared 18 March &quot;Marcel Marceau Day&quot;.

Marceau accepted the honor and responsibilities of serving as Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Second World Assembly on Aging, which took place in Madrid, Spain, in April 2002.

On 22 March 2023, Google celebrated his 100th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="176847" wikidata="Q1427842" url="?curid=176847" title="Fleischer Studios">
<text>Fleischer Studios () was an American animation studio founded in 1929 by brothers Max and Dave Fleischer, who ran the pioneering company from its inception until its acquisition by Paramount Pictures, the parent company and the distributor of its films. In its prime, Fleischer Studios was a premier producer of animated cartoons for theaters, with Walt Disney Productions being its chief competitor in the 1930s.

Fleischer Studios included &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; and &quot;Talkartoons&quot; characters like, Koko the Clown, Betty Boop, Bimbo, Popeye the Sailor, and the comic character Superman. Unlike other studios, whose characters were anthropomorphic animals, the Fleischers&#x27; most successful characters were humans (with the exception of Bimbo, a black-and-white cartoon dog). The cartoons of the Fleischer Studio were very different from those of Disney, both in concept and in execution. As a result, they were rough rather than refined and consciously artistic rather than commercial, but in their unique way, their artistry was expressed through a culmination of the arts and sciences. This approach focused on surrealism, dark humor, adult psychological elements, and sexuality. Furthermore, the environments were grittier and urban, often set in squalid surroundings, reflecting the Great Depression as well as German Expressionism.

== History ==
=== The silent era ===
The Fleischer Studio was built on Max Fleischer&#x27;s novelty film series &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; (1918–1927). The novelty was based largely on the results of the &quot;rotoscope&quot;, invented by Fleischer to produce realistic animation. The first &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; films were produced through The Bray Studio. They featured Fleischer&#x27;s first character, &quot;The Clown&quot;, which became known as Ko-Ko the Clown in 1924.

In 1921, The Bray Studio ran afoul of legal issues, having contracted for more films than it could deliver to its distributor, Goldwyn Pictures. The Fleischer Brothers left and began their own studio, Out of the Inkwell Films, with Dave Fleischer as director and production supervisor, and Max as producer, at 129 East 45th Street, later to 1600 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City. In 1924, animator, Dick Huemer came to the Out of the Inkwell Films studio and redesigned &quot;The Clown&quot; for more efficient animation. Huemer&#x27;s new design and experience as an animator moved them away from their dependency on the rotoscope for fluid animation. In addition to defining the clown, Huemer established the Fleischer style with its distinctive thick and thin ink lines. In addition, Huemer created Ko-Ko&#x27;s companion, Fitz the Dog, who would evolve into Bimbo in 1930.

Throughout the 1920s, Fleischer was one of the leading producers of animation with clever moments and numerous innovations. These innovations include the &quot;Rotograph&quot;, an early &quot;Aerial Image&quot; photographic process for compositing animation with live action backgrounds. Other innovations included &quot;Ko-Ko Song Car-Tunes&quot; and sing-along shorts (featuring the famous &quot;bouncing ball&quot;), a precursor to karaoke.

In 1924, distributor Edwin Miles Fadiman and Hugo Riesenfeld formed the Red Seal Pictures Corporation. Riesenfeld was the theatrical manager of the Strand, Rivoli, and Rialto theaters on Broadway. Because the Out of the Inkwell films were a major part of the program in Riesenfeld&#x27;s theaters, the Fleischers were invited to become partners. The Red Seal Company committed to an ambitious release schedule of 26 films with The Inkwell Studio as the primary supplier. The following year, Red Seal released 141 films that included documentaries, short comedy subjects, and live-action serials. Carrie of the Chorus, also known as Backstage Comedies, was one of the Red Seal series that featured Max&#x27;s daughter, Ruth, in a supporting role. Ray Bolger made his screen debut in this series and dated Ruth for a short time.

Red Seal released cartoon novelty series such as &quot;The Animated Hair&quot; cartoons by cartoonist &quot;Marcus&quot;, and &quot;Inklings&quot;. &quot;The Animated Hair&quot; series resembled the on-screen hand drawing gimmick established in &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot;. In this case, &quot;Marcus&quot; produced high-quality ink line portraits of celebrities and political figures. Then through stop motion animation techniques, the lines and forms would break away to entertainingly re-form the portrait into another. &quot;Inklings&quot; was similar in concept to the &quot;Animated Hair&quot; films, but was more of a visual puzzle novelty using a variety of progressive scratch-off/reveal techniques and rearranged animated cutouts to change the images.

It was during this time that Lee de Forest started filming his Phonofilms experiments featuring several of the major Broadway headliners. The Red Seal company began acquiring more theaters outside of New York and equipped them with sound equipment produced by Lee de Forest, displaying &quot;talkies&quot; three years before the sound revolution began. Because of Max&#x27;s interest in technology, Riesenfeld introduced him to de Forest. It was through this partnership that Max produced a number of the Ko-Ko Song Car-tunes as sound releases. Of the 36 song films produced between 1924 and 1927, 12 were produced as sound films beginning in 1926 with standard silent versions as well. The first sound release was &quot;Mother Pin a Rose on Me&quot;. Other sound releases included &quot;Darling Nellie Gray&quot;, &quot;Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly?&quot;, &quot;When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Coming Through the Rye&quot;, &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Gone to the Country&quot;, &quot;Margie, Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot;, &quot;Sweet Adeline,&quot; &quot;Old Black Joe&quot;, &quot;Come Take A Trip in My Airship&quot;, and &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot;.

Red Seal owned 56 theaters, extending as far west as Cleveland, Ohio. But after only two years of operation, Red Seal was broke. Max Fleischer sought an appointment of receiver in bankruptcy in October 1926. Just as the situation looked hopeless, Alfred Weiss offered a Paramount contact.

The Paramount deal provided financing and distribution, but due to legal complications of the bankruptcy, the title to &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; was changed to &quot;The Inkwell Imps&quot; (1927–1929) and the studio was renamed Inkwell Studios. One year into the relationship, the Fleischer Brothers discovered mismanagement under Weiss and left before the end of the &quot;Imps&quot; contract. Out of the Inkwell Films, Inc. filed bankruptcy in January 1929. In March, Max formed Fleischer Studios with Dave as his partner. Operations were first set up at the Carpenter-Goldman Laboratories in Queens. With a skeleton staff, Fleischer Studios started out doing industrial films, most notably, &quot;Finding His Voice&quot;, a technical demonstration film explaining Western Electric&#x27;s Variable Density recording and reproduction system. Max Fleischer secured a new contract with Paramount to produce a revival of the &quot;Bouncing Ball&quot; song films, re-branded as &quot;Screen Songs&quot;, with &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot; as the first release on February 5, 1929.

=== Sound films ===
The early experiments with sound synchronization gave Fleischer Studios experience in perfecting the post-production method of recording, aided by several inventions by founder, Max Fleischer. With the conversion to sound, Paramount needed more sound films, and cartoons could be produced faster than feature films. As the &quot;Screen Songs&quot; returned Fleischer to the established song film format, a new sound series, &quot;Talkartoons&quot; replaced the silent &quot;Inkwell Imps&quot;, the first being &quot;Noah&#x27;s Lark&quot; released on October 25, 1929. Earlier entries in the series were one-shot cartoons, until the appearance of &quot;Bimbo&quot; as of the fourth entry. Bimbo evolved through several redesigns in each cartoon for the first year. While the intent was to develop him as the star of the series, it was the cameo appearance of a Helen Kane caricature in the seventh entry, &quot;Dizzy Dishes&quot; that took center stage. Audience reactions to the New York preview were so great that Paramount encouraged the continued development of the most famous character to come from the Fleischer Studio by that time, Betty Boop. While originated as a hybrid human/canine character, Betty Boop was transformed into the human character she is known as by 1932. Having become the main attraction of the &quot;Talkartoons&quot;, she was given her own series, which ran until 1939.

The &quot;Jazz Baby&quot; Flapper character, Betty Boop lifted the spirits of Depression Era audiences with her paradoxical mixture of childlike innocence and sexual allure. Being a musical novelty character, she was a natural for theatrical entertainment. Several of her early cartoons were developed as promotional vehicles for some of the top Black Jazz performers of the day including Louis Armstrong (&quot;I&#x27;ll Be Glad When You&#x27;re Dead You Rascal, You&quot;), Don Redman (&quot;I Heard&quot;), and most notably, the three cartoons made with Cab Calloway, &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, &quot;Snow White&quot;, and &quot;The Old Man of the Mountain&quot;. This was considered a bold action in light of the Jim Crow policies active in the South where such films would not be shown.

In 1934, the Hays Code resulted in severe censorship for films. This affected the content of all of Paramount&#x27;s films as well, which tended to reflect a more &quot;mature&quot; tone in the features of the Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, and most of all, Mae West. As a result, each of these stars was released as Paramount changed the content of its films to reflect a more &quot;general audience&quot; in order to comply with the new Code and stay in business. Paramount had also gone through three reorganizations from bankruptcy between 1931 and 1936. The new management under Barney Balaban set out to make more general audience films of the type made at MGM, but for lower budgets. This change in content policy affected the content of cartoons that Fleischer was to produce for Paramount, which urged emulation of the Walt Disney product.

While Paramount was a large organization with a network of theaters, its fiscal consciousness was largely responsible for preventing Fleischer Studios from acquiring the three-strip Technicolor process, leaving it available for a four-year exclusivity with Walt Disney, who created a new market for color cartoons, established by Academy Award winner, &quot;Flowers and Trees&quot; (1932).

Paramount acquiesced to the release of the Color Classics series starting in 1934, but with the exclusivity of the three-color process still held by Disney, Fleischer Studios used the available two-color processes, Cinecolor, a two-emulsion red and blue process, and Two-color Technicolor, using red and green. By 1936, the Disney exclusivity had expired, and Fleischer Studios used the three-color process in its color cartoons beginning with &quot;Somewhere in Dreamland&quot; and continued using it for the remainder of its active years.

The Fleischer Studio&#x27;s greatest success came with the licensing of E.C. Segar&#x27;s comic strip character Popeye the Sailor beginning in 1933. &quot;Popeye&quot; eventually became the most popular series the studio ever produced, and its success surpassed Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse cartoons, documented by popularity polls. With the availability of full spectrum color, the Fleischer Studios produced three two-reel &quot;Popeye&quot; featurettes, &quot;Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor&quot; (1936), &quot;Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba&#x27;s Forty Thieves&quot; (1937), and &quot;Popeye the Sailor Meets Aladdin&#x27;s Wonderful Lamp&quot; (1939). This series of longer-format cartoons were an indication of the emergence of the animated feature film as a commercially viable project beginning with Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937).

The Fleischer Studios had reached its zenith by 1936, with four series and 52 annual releases. Due to the phenomenal success of the Popeye cartoons, Paramount demanded more, and the Fleischer Studio experienced rapid expansion in order to balance out the increased workload. The crowded conditions, production speedups, drawing quotas, and internal management problems resulted in a labor strike beginning in May 1937 which lasted for five months. This strike was a test case, the first launched in the motion picture industry, and produced a nationwide boycott of Fleischer cartoons for the duration.
Max Fleischer had been petitioning Paramount for three years about producing an animated feature. Paramount vetoed his proposals until the proven success of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937). Paramount now wanted an animated feature for a 1939 Christmas release. This request came at the time of preparations for relocating to Miami, Florida. While the relocation had been a consideration for some time, its final motivation was made a reality due to lower corporate tax structures and an alleged escape from the remaining hostility from the strike.

The new Fleischer Studio opened in October 1938, and production on its first feature, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1939), went from the development stage begun in New York to active production in Miami. The score was by Paramount staff composer, Victor Young and recorded at the Paramount west coast facilities. While limited to only 60 theaters in a one-month release, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; earned more than $3 million in the United States alone, exceeding its original $500,000 estimated cost. Accordingly, a second feature was ordered for the Christmas period, &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot; (1941).

=== Fall of Fleischer ===
The personal relationship between Max and Dave Fleischer deteriorated during the Miami period due to complications associated with the pressures of finishing the studio&#x27;s first feature film and Dave&#x27;s very public adulterous affair with his secretary, Mae Schwartz. Max and Dave stopped speaking to each other altogether by the end of 1939, communicating solely by memo.

Dave gained total control of production in 1940, relegating Max to business affairs and research. The studio was in need of new products going into the new decade, but the new shorts series that debuted in 1939 and 1940, &quot;Gabby&quot;, &quot;Stone Age Cartoons&quot;, and &quot;Animated Antics&quot;, were unsuccessful. Theater operators complained, with the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons having the only value.

Paramount acquired the rights to comic book superhero &quot;Superman&quot; in 1941, and the Fleischers were assigned to work on a series of animated &quot;Superman&quot; shorts. The first entry, &quot;Superman&quot;, had a budget of $50,000, the highest ever for a Fleischer theatrical short, and was nominated for an Academy Award.

The animated &quot;Superman&quot; series, with its action-adventure and science fiction fantasy content, was a huge success, but that did not help the studio out of its financial trouble. It was penalized $350,000 for going over budget on &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, and the revenues earned from the rentals of the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons had to be used to offset the loss of $250,000 incurred by the rejection of cartoons in 1940.

=== Acquisition by Paramount ===

While profits dwindled, Paramount continued to advance money to Fleischer Studios to continue the production of cartoons with its focus mainly on &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;, a new feature film for the 1941 Christmas season. On May 24, 1941, Paramount demanded reimbursement on the penalties still owed after 18 months and assumed full ownership of Fleischer Studios, Inc. The Fleischers remained in control of production until that November. &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;, intended for release in December 1941, was not released until February 1942, and never recouped its costs.

In spite of living up to his contractual obligations and delivering the film, Max Fleischer was asked to resign. Dave Fleischer had resigned the month before, and Paramount finished out the last five months of the Fleischer contract without the Fleischer brothers. The last cartoon produced at the credited Fleischer Studios was the &quot;Superman&quot; cartoon &quot;Terror on the Midway&quot;. Paramount formed a new company, Famous Studios, as a successor to Fleischer Studios effective on July 3, 1942.

=== Television ===
With the exception of the &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons, Paramount&#x27;s cartoon library of releases prior to October 1950 was originally sold to U.M. &amp; M. TV Corporation in 1955. A condition of the purchase required the removal of the Paramount logos and copyright lines from the main titles.

As soon as the Fleischer library was sold to television, Max Fleischer noticed that some of the cartoons were being shown without his name in the credits, which was a violation of his original contracts. On June 17, 1956, Max Fleischer filed suit against Paramount and its TV distribution partners, seeking $2,750,000 in damages. The infringement on his name was corrected on all subsequent prints exhibited on television.

Before U.M.&amp; M. had finished the title alterations, the company was bought by National Telefilm Associates. NTA placed their logo at the heads and tails of the films and blacked out references to Paramount, Technicolor, Cinecolor and Polacolor. The majority of the Fleischer cartoons were off the air by the mid 60s when the original copyrights were due for renewal. NTA failed to renew the copyrights, which placed the majority of the Fleischer film library (including the &quot;Color Classics&quot; series, the &quot;Screen Songs&quot; series, and &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;) into the public domain. &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot;, various &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoons, and the 1938 &quot;Color Classic&quot;, &quot;The Tears of an Onion&quot;, are among the few films that remain under copyright to Melange Pictures, LLC.

In the mid-1970s, NTA converted 85 black and white &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoons to color through Fred Ladd&#x27;s Color Systems company. The process was done by having the cartoons traced and re-colored by Korean animators. These were packaged in 1976 under the title &quot;Betty Boop for President&quot;. This was refashioned as a compilation feature, &quot;Hooray for Betty Boop&quot;, and ran on HBO in 1980.

Paramount has reacquired ownership of the original Fleischer film library (through their acquisition of Republic Pictures) since 1996 and continues to own the theatrical rights.

=== &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; ===
The &quot;Popeye&quot; series, a property licensed from King Features Syndicate, was acquired by Associated Artists Productions (a.a.p.), which later became part of United Artists (for info on the &quot;Popeye&quot; retitling, see the a.a.p. article) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Turner Entertainment Co., after briefly owning MGM outright, settled for ownership of the library, including the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons, in 1986. A small number of &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons have also entered the public domain.

&quot;Superman&quot;, the other series based on licensing, reverted to National Comics after Paramount&#x27;s rights to the character expired. TV syndication rights were initially licensed to Flamingo Films, distributors of the 1950s &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; TV series. All 17 entries in this series entered the public domain in the late 1960s, when National failed to renew their copyrights.

Nevertheless, the &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons are now under the ownership of Warner Bros., a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery; Warner bought the original film elements to the &quot;Superman&quot; series in 1969, after becoming a sibling (and later the parent) to DC Comics.

=== Home video ===
Most of the Fleischer color titles have been widely available on video since the 1980s, often on inexpensive videotapes sold in supermarkets and discount stores. Animation fans, the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and more recently the Max Fleischer estate and Paramount Pictures (via the Republic/Melange library) have worked to release high-quality restored editions of the Fleischer cartoons. These have also been made available on pay-cable, home video, DVD, and online on YouTube. Many of these restored versions now include the original front-and-end Paramount titles.

Most of the silent Fleischer titles from the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot;/&quot;Inkwell Imps&quot; series have entered the public domain.

An official &quot;Betty Boop&quot; VHS set, &quot;Betty Boop Confidential&quot;, was released by Republic Pictures in 1995, included several black-and-white &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoons as well as Betty&#x27;s only color appearance, &quot;Poor Cinderella&quot;.

There have been several video releases for the &quot;Superman&quot; series. These include a 1991 VHS set produced by Bosko Video, titled &quot;The Complete Superman Collection: Golden Anniversary Edition – The Paramount Cartoon Classics of Max &amp; Dave Fleischer&quot; released as two volumes which featured transfers from 35mm prints. It was reissued on DVD as &quot;The Complete Superman Cartoons — Diamond Anniversary Edition&quot; in 2000 by Image Entertainment, and &quot;Superman Adventures&quot; in 2004 by Platinum Disc Corporation.

A third (and more &quot;official&quot;) compilation using restored and remastered materials was released in November 2006 by Warner Home Video as part of their DVD box set of Superman films. In 2009, Warner gave these Superman shorts their own stand-alone 2-disc DVD release, &quot;Max Fleischer&#x27;s Superman: 1941–1942&quot;.

Olive Films, under exclusive license from Melange/Viacom, acquired the rights to the 66 non-public domain Betty Boop cartoons, and released four volumes of &quot;Betty Boop&quot; DVDs and Blu-rays.

Warner Home Video has released all of the Fleischer Popeye cartoons in three volumes as part of the &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; DVD collection.

VCI Entertainment/Kit Parker Films&#x27; DVD compilation of all the &quot;Color Classics&quot; (except &quot;The Tears of an Onion&quot;), entitled &quot;Somewhere In Dreamland&quot;, was released in 2003. It includes only a fraction of shorts remastered from 35mm film, but otherwise taken from the best available sources Kit Parker could provide VCI, and digitally recreating the original front-and-end Paramount titles. Animation archivist Jerry Beck served as consultant for this box set, as well as providing audio commentary for select shorts.

VCI Entertainment also released a DVD compilation of all the public domain &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons (both Fleischer and Famous) entitled &quot;Popeye the Sailor Man Classic Cartoons: 75th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; in 2004.

In Japan, &quot;Mr. Bug Goes to Town&quot; was released on DVD in April 2010 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment as part of the Studio Ghibli&#x27;s Ghibli Museum Library collection.

=== Fleischer Studios today ===
In 1985, DC Comics named Fleischer Studios as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot; for its work on the Superman cartoons.

Today, a new iteration of Fleischer Studios effectively holds the rights to Betty Boop and associated characters such as Koko the Clown, Bimbo and Grampy, though courts have never supported their ownership claims. It is headed by Max&#x27;s grandson Mark Fleischer, who oversees merchandising activities. Fleischer Studios utilizes King Features Syndicate to license Fleischer characters for various merchandise.

In 2021, after decades of being shown in altered and worn prints, the Fabulous Fleischer Cartoons Restored company was started by Max Fleischer&#x27;s granddaughter, Jane Fleischer Reid, to focus on the restoration and screening of the Fleischer Studios library. The restoration efforts are a collaboration between film archives around the world including Paramount Pictures which owns the original camera negatives. Beginning with &quot;Somewhere in Dreamland&quot;; the restored cartoon had its premiere on the MeTV network in December of the same year. In March of 2023, a week long screening event took place at the Museum of Modern Art which showcased around 60 brand new Fleischer restorations.

== Legacy and influence ==
The loose, improvisatory animation, frequently surreal action generally termed &quot;The New York Style&quot; (particularly in films such as &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Bimbo&#x27;s Initiation&quot;), grungy atmosphere, and racy pre-Code content of the early Fleischer Studios cartoons have been a major influence on many underground and alternative cartoonists. Kim Deitch, Robert Crumb, Jim Woodring, and Al Columbia are among the creators who have specifically acknowledged their inspiration. Much of Richard Elfman&#x27;s 1980 cult film &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot; is a live action pastiche of the early Fleischer Studios style. The Fleischer style was also used in the 1995 animated series &quot;The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat&quot;. The studio&#x27;s art style and surreal atmosphere was a central influence on the indie game &quot;Cuphead&quot;, with the studio being described as &quot;magnetic north&quot; for the game&#x27;s art style. Genndy Tartakovsky has also cited the works of the studio as a major inspiration for the look of his 2023 animated series &quot;&quot;.

<text>Antonio Griffo Focas Flavio Angelo Ducas Comneno Porfirogenito Gagliardi De Curtis di Bisanzio (15 February 1898 – 15 April 1967), best known by his stage name Totò (), or simply as Antonio de Curtis, and nicknamed &quot;il principe della risata&quot; (&quot;the prince of laughter&quot;), was an Italian actor, comedian, screenwriter, dramatist, poet, singer and lyricist. He is commonly referred to as one of the most popular Italian performers of all time. While best known for his funny and sometimes cynical comic characters in theatre and then many successful comedy films made from the 1940s to the 1960s, he also worked with many iconic Italian film directors in dramatic roles.

==Early life==
Totò was born Antonio Vincenzo Stefano Clemente on 15 February 1898 in the Rione Sanità, a poor district of Naples, the illegitimate son of Anna Clemente (1881–1947), a Sicilian woman, and the Neapolitan marquis Giuseppe de Curtis (1873–1944). His father did not legally recognize him, and Totò so regretted growing up without a father that in 1933, at age 35, he managed to have the marquis Francesco Maria Gagliardi Focas adopt him in exchange for a life annuity. As a consequence, when Marquis de Curtis finally recognized him in 1937 Totò had become an heir of two noble families, ultimately claiming an impressive slew of titles.
Totò&#x27;s mother wanted him to become a priest, but as early as 1913, at the age of 15, he was already acting as a comedian in small theatres, under the pseudonym Clerment. His early repertoire mostly consisted in imitations of Gustavo De Marco&#x27;s characters. In the minor venues where he performed, Totò had the chance to meet famous artists like Eduardo and Peppino De Filippo. He served in the Italian Army during World War I and then went back to acting. He learned the art of the &quot;guitti&quot;, the Neapolitan scriptless comedians, heirs to the tradition of the Commedia dell&#x27;Arte, and began developing the trademarks of his style, including a puppet-like, disjointed gesticulation, emphasized facial expressions, and an extreme, sometimes surrealistic, sense of humor, largely based on emphasizing primitive urges such as hunger and sexual desire.

==Career==
In 1922, he moved to Rome to perform in bigger theatres. He performed in the genre of &quot;avanspettacolo&quot;, a vaudevillian mixture of music, ballet and comedy preceding the main act (hence its name, which roughly translates as &quot;before show&quot;). He became adept at these shows (also known as &quot;rivista&quot; – &quot;Revue&quot;), and in the 1930s he had his own company, with which he travelled across Italy. In 1937, he appeared in his first movie &quot;Fermo con le mani&quot;, and later starred in 96 other films.

As the vast majority of his movies were essentially meant to showcase his performances, many have his name &quot;Totò&quot; in the title. Some of his best-known films are &quot;Fifa e Arena&quot;, &quot;Totò al Giro d&#x27;Italia&quot;, &quot;Totò Sceicco&quot;, &quot;Guardie e ladri&quot;, &quot;Totò e le donne&quot;, &quot;Totò Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Totò terzo uomo&quot;, &quot;Totò a colori&quot; (one of the first Italian color movies, 1952, in Ferraniacolor), &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot;, &quot;Totò, Peppino e la malafemmina&quot;, &quot;La legge è legge&quot;. Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;The Hawks and the Sparrows&quot; and the episode &quot;Che cosa sono le nuvole&quot; from &quot;Caprice Italian Style&quot; (the latter released after his death), showed his dramatic skills.
In his vast cinematographic career, Totò had the opportunity to act side by side with virtually all major Italian actors of the time. With some of them he paired in several films, the most renowned and successful teams being established with Aldo Fabrizi and Peppino De Filippo. De Filippo was one of the few actors to have his name appear in movie titles along with that of Totò, for example in &quot;Totò, Peppino e la malafemmina&quot; and &quot;Totò e Peppino divisi a Berlino&quot;.

Partly because of the radical, naive immorality of his roles, some of his more spicy gags raised much controversy in a society that was both strictly Catholic and ruled by the conservative Democrazia Cristiana (Christian Democracy) party. For example, Totò&#x27;s 1964 movie &quot;Che fine ha fatto Totò Baby?&quot; (a parody of &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot;) included a humorous celebration of cannabis in an era when drugs were perceived by the Italian audience as something exotic, depraved and dangerous.

===Writing===
During the 1950s, he started to compose poetry. The best-known is probably &quot;&#x27;A Livella&quot;, in which an arrogant rich man and a humble poor man meet after their deaths and discuss their differences. Totò was also a songwriter: &quot;Malafemmena&quot; (&quot;Wayward Woman&quot;), dedicated to his wife Diana after they separated, is considered a classic of the Neapolitan popular music.

==Personal life==

Totò had a reputation as a playboy. One of his lovers, the well known chanteuse and dancer , committed suicide after their relationship ended. This tragedy marked his life. He buried Liliana in his family&#x27;s chapel, and named his only daughter Liliana (born 10 May 1933 to his wife, Diana Bandini Rogliani, whom he married in 1935).

Another personal tragedy was the premature birth of his son Massenzio in 1954. The child died a few hours later. He was the son of Totò&#x27;s mistress Franca Faldini. During a tour in 1956, he lost most of his eyesight due to an eye infection that he had ignored to avoid cancelling his show and disappointing his fans. Arguably however, the handicap almost never affected his schedule and acting abilities.

Totò died at the age of 69 on 15 April 1967 in Rome after a series of heart attacks. Due to overwhelming demand, there were no fewer than three funeral services: the first in Rome, a second in his birth city of Naples—and a few days later, in a third one by the local Camorra boss, an empty casket was carried along the packed streets of the popular Rione Sanità quarter where he was born.

==Noble titles==
In 1946, when the Consulta Araldica—the body that advised the Kingdom of Italy on matters of nobility—ceased operations, the Tribunal of Naples recognized his numerous titles, so his complete name was changed from Antonio Clemente to Antonio Griffo Focas Flavio Ducas Komnenos Gagliardi de Curtis of Byzantium, His Imperial Highness, Palatine Count, Knight of the Holy Roman Empire, Exarch of Ravenna, Duke of Macedonia and Illyria, Prince of Constantinople, Cilicia, Thessaly, Pontus, Moldavia, Dardania, Peloponnesus, Count of Cyprus and Epirus, Count and Duke of Drivasto and Durazzo. For someone born and raised in one of the poorest Neapolitan neighbourhoods, this must have been quite an achievement, but in claiming the titles (at the time they had become meaningless) the comedian also mocked them for their intrinsic worthlessness. In fact, when he was not using his stage name Totò, he mostly referred to himself simply as Antonio de Curtis.

<text>(literally &#x27;double six&#x27;) refers to two different forms of a Japanese board game: &quot;ban-sugoroku&quot; (盤双六, &#x27;board-sugoroku&#x27;) which is similar to western tables games like backgammon, and &quot;e-sugoroku&quot; (絵双六, &#x27;picture-sugoroku&#x27;) which is similar to Western snakes and ladders.

==Ban-sugoroku==

&quot;Ban-sugoroku&quot; is played in a similar way to western tables games. It has the same starting position as backgammon, but the aim and rules of play are different. For example:

* Doubles are not special. If a player rolls doubles, each die still counts only once.
* There is no &quot;bearing off&quot;. The goal is to move all of one&#x27;s men to within the last six spaces of the board.
* There is no doubling cube.
* &quot;Closing out&quot;, that is forming a prime of six contiguous points with one or more of opponents men on the bar, is an automatic win.

The game is thought to have been introduced from China (where it was known as Shuanglu) into Japan in the sixth century.

It is known that in the centuries following the game&#x27;s introduction into Japan it was made illegal several times, most prominently in 689 and 754. This is because the simple and luck-based nature of sugoroku made it an ideal gambling game. This version of sugoroku and records of playing for gambling continuously appeared until early Edo era. In early Edo-era, a new and quick gambling game called &quot;Chō-han&quot; (丁半) appeared and using sugoroku for gambling quickly dwindled.

This variant of the tables family has died out in Japan and most other countries, while the Western style modern backgammon (with doubling-cube) still has some avid players.

==E-sugoroku==

A simpler &quot;e-sugoroku&quot;, with rules similar to snakes and ladders , appeared as early as late 13th century and was made popular due to the cheap and elaborate wooden block printing technology of the Edo period. Thousands of variations of boards were made with pictures and themes from religion, political, actors, and even adult material. In the Meiji and later periods, this variation of the game remained popular and was often included in child-oriented magazines. With &quot;ban-sugoroku&quot; being obsolete, today the word &quot;sugoroku&quot; almost always means &quot;e-sugoroku&quot;.

==Other sugoroku games==
Many e-sugoroku-based video games were released, including: &quot;Kiteretsu Daihyakka: Chōjikū Sugoroku&quot;, &quot;Sugoroku Ginga Senki&quot;, &quot;Battle Hunter&quot;, &quot;Ganbare Goemon: Mononoke Sugoroku&quot;, &quot;Culdcept&quot;, &quot;Dokodemo Hamster 4: Doki Doki Sugoroku Daibouken!&quot;, &quot;Hello Kitty: Minna de Sugoroku&quot;, &quot;Gotouchi Hello Kitty Sugoroku Monogatari&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Sugoroku&#x27;s Board Game&quot;, &quot;Family Pirate Party&quot;, &quot;Hidamari Sketch: Doko Demo Sugoroku x 365&quot;, and &quot;PictureBook Games: Pop-Up Pursuit&quot;.

The video game &quot;Samurai Warriors 2&quot; features a mini-game named Sugoroku, but it bears very little resemblance to traditional Sugoroku. Instead, it plays very much like &quot;Itadaki Street&quot;, &quot;Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, or a simplified version of &quot;Monopoly&quot;: players take turns in moving around a board, the spaces of which are designated as different territories of Japan. By landing on an unoccupied space, the player is able to buy that space for a set amount of money. If one player lands on a space purchased by another, they must pay a fee to that player, or else can choose to challenge the player for control of that space (utilising the main &quot;Samurai Warriors 2&quot; game engine for special challenge games). Also present on the board are &quot;Shrine&quot; spaces, which are roughly analogous to &quot;Monopoly&quot;&#x27;s Chance and Community Chest spaces.

The &quot;Mario Party&quot; series can be seen with heavy influences from sugoroku, especially e-sugoroku.

The video game &quot;Eternal Melody&quot; is primarily a simulation game with RPG elements, including dungeons. Dungeon exploration plays out as a game of Sugoroku.

The survival horror game &quot;Kuon&quot; features &quot;ban-sugoroku&quot; as a minigame that can be unlocked.

Several of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games feature a minigame called sugoroku (known as &quot;Treasures n&#x27; Trapdoors&quot; or &quot;Pachisi&quot; in English localizations) that has players moving along a board with spaces after rolling a 6-sided die.
